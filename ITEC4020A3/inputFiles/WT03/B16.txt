Partial Table-of-Contents Starting the server Starting automatically from the OS/2 startup folder Starting from the Internet Connection Secure Server icon Starting from the command prompt Starting multiple instances of the server Restarting from the Internet Connection Secure Server Window Restarting from the Configuration and Administration Forms Stopping the server Starting the server This section describes how to start and stop your serverafter you have finished installing it.If you think the server is running but you do not see the windowfor it on your OS/2 Desktop, press Ctrl+Escto see the list of active OS/2 programs.If the Window List contains an entry for the server, double clickthe entry to bring the server's window into view. If you are running a non-secure server,you will see the messageSecurity not available. filename.dll did not load.This message lets you know that you are not running the Internet Connection Secure Server.You do not need to do anything in response to the message. Starting automatically from the OS/2 startup folder If during installation you checked Auto Start Server at Bootup,the server has been added to your OS/2 Startup folder.Each time you start or reboot your system, the server will start.If you rebooted your system after installing the server,the server should be running now. When you start the server automatically,it uses the current configuration settings.If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,the current configuration is based on the information youentered during installation along with defaults. Starting from the Internet Connection Secure Server icon The installation procedure creates an Internet Connection Secure Serverfolder on your OS/2 Desktop.Inside the folder is an icon for the Internet Connection Secure Server.To start the server, double click the icon. The server starts with the current configuration settings.If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,the current configuration is based on the information youentered during installation along with defaults. Starting from the command prompt You can start the server from any OS/2 command prompt by entering: httpd This starts the server with the current configuration settings.If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,the current configuration is based on the information youentered during installation along with defaults. The httpd command also accepts various options for changingconfiguration settings at run time.For details on the httpd command options,see "httpd command". Starting multiple instances of the server You can start multiple instances of the server,but each instance must listen on a separate port.All instances, other than the first, can be startedby entering the following command from a command prompt: httpd -r other_rule_file where other_rule_file is a configuration file thatspecifies the individual port. Restarting from the Internet Connection Secure Server Window You can restart your server from the Internet Connection Secure Server windowby selecting Restartfrom the Server pull-down menu on the menu bar.The server reloads the configuration settings fromthe configuration file it was originally started with. Most changes you have made to the configuration filewill be used by the server after it restarts.However, if you changed a port setting or security settings, you needto stop your server and start it again for those changes to take effect. Restarting from the Configuration and Administration Forms When using the Configuration and Administration Forms, you are sometimesgiven the option of restarting the server after you apply changes.See "Using the Configuration and Administration forms" for more information. Stopping the server You can stop the server the same ways you stop other OS/2 programs.Do any of the following: Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and double clickthe small icon in the top left corner. Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and select Exit from theServer pull-down menu on the menu bar. Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and press F3. Press Ctrl+Esc.With the right mouse button click the Window List entry for the Internet Connection Secure Server.Click Close.

For a list of the new directives added in Version 4.2,see page reference #1. Some directives (the value portion) containtemplates for requests, path names, or host names.Except where otherwise indicated,you can use the asterisk (*) character in templates.For the template to be matched, an asterisk can be replaced byany character string or single character. The examples and defaults in this chapteruse the backslash (\) character when showing a path name.In the configuration file, you can actually use either thebackslash or forward slash (/) character when specifying a path name.Always use the forward slash (/) when specifying a URL or requesttemplate. Several configuration directives allow youto specify a positive string.You can enter any of the following words: Yes On OK Enable Several configuration directives allow youto specify a negative string.You can enter any of the following words: No Off None Disable Several configuration directives allow you to specifyan amount of time.You can specify any combination of: hh hours hh:mm hours and minutes hh:mm:ss hours, minutes, and seconds n years number of 365-day years n months number of 30-day months n weeks number of 7-day weeks n days number of 24-hour days n hours number of 60-minute hours n minutes number of 60-second minutes n seconds number of seconds All of your entries will be converted to seconds and added together. Basic - Specify required settings Basic Use the directives described in this section tocontrol your server's basic configuration settings. BindSpecific - Specify if the server binds to one or all IP addresses Use this directive on a multi-networking systemto run a different server on each IP address.All the servers may listen on the same port. If you specify On, the server binds to the IP address specified in theHostName directive only, instead of binding to all local IP addresses. If this directive has not been specified, the server binds to thedefault HostName. If you change this directive, you must stop the serverand then start it again.The server will not pick up the change if you only restart it. Example    BindSpecific On Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting    BindSpecific Off DNS-Lookup - Specify whether you want to look up host names of clients Use this directive to specify whether you want your server to look upthe host name of requesting clients. The value you use affects the following things about how your serverworks: The performance of the server.Using the default value of Off improvesthe performance and response timeof the server because it does not use resourcesto perform the host name lookup. The information your server records aboutclients when writing to log files. Off - Clients identified by IP address On - Clients identified by host name Whether you can use host names on address templates inprotection setups, server group files, and ACL files. Off - Cannot use host names on address templates; mustuse IP addresses On - Can use host names on address templates; cannot useIP addresses Example    DNS-Lookup   On Initial configuration file setting    DNS-Lookup   Off HostName - Specify the fully qualified domain name or IP address for the server Use this directive to specify the domain name oran IP address returned to clients from document requests.If you specify a domain name, a domain name servermust be able to resolve the name into an IP address.If you specify an IP address, the domain name server is not neededor accessed. Example    HostName name or IP address Initial Configuration File Setting The name you specified for Host name during installation.The installation default is the default host name defined in yourdomain name server.If you remove this directive, the default host name defined in yourdomain name server is used. imbeds - Specify whether server-side includes will be dynamically imbedded Use this directive to specify if you want server-side includeprocessing to be performed for documents served from the file system,CGI programs, or both.Server-side include processing is done on documentswith a content type of text/x-ssi-html.Optionally, you can specify that server-side include processingalso be done for documents with a content type of text/html.For more information about content types,see "AddType - Specify the data type of files with particular extensions". You can use server-side includes to dynamically insertinformation, such as the date, the size of a file, the lastchange date of a file, CGI or server-side include environmentvariables, or text documents into the document being returned.For more information on using server-side includes,see "Using server-side includes to insert information into CGI programs and HTML documents". Server-side include processing causes the server to search yourdocuments for special commands each time they are served.This can affect the server's performance andslow down response time to clients. The format of this directive is: imbeds source [type] source can be: on Server-side include processing is done for documents from thefile system and from CGI programs. files Server-side include processing is only done for documentsfrom the file system. cgi Server-side include processing is only done for documentsreturned by CGI programs. off Server-side include processing is not done for any documents. The server checks the content type of each file it retrievesand the output of each CGI program it processes. Server-side include processing is normally done onlyfor documents having a content type of text/x-ssi/html.However, you can specify that documents witha content type of text/html be processed for server-side includes. type can be: SSIOnly Server-side include processing is done for documentswith a content type of text/x-ssi-html. html Server-side include processing is done for documentswith a content type of text/html and a content type of text/x-ssi-html. Important migration note: In previous releases,you could specify that documents with a specificextension, such as .html, .htm. or .shtml,be processed for server-side includes.In this release, the server treats html, .html, and .htm ashtml.Anything else is treated as SSIOnly. Each extension must have an AddType directive defined with thecorrect content type.If you use extensions other than .htm or .html, makesure an AddType directive is defined with a content typeof text/x-ssi/html. Initial configuration file setting    imbeds on SSIOnly Program default setting    imbeds off SSIOnly Port - Specify the port on which you want the server to listen for requests Use this directive to specify the port numberthe server should listen to for requests.The standard port number for HTTP is 80.Other port numbers less than 1024 are reservedfor other TCP/IP applications and should not be used.Common ports used for proxy Web servers are 8080 and 8008. When a port other than 80 is used, clients are requiredto include a specific port number on requests to the server.The port number is preceded by a colon andplaced after the host name on the URL.For example, from the browser, the URL    http://www.turfco.com:8008/ requests the default welcome page from a host namedwww.turfco.com that is listening on port 8008. You can use the -p option on the httpd commandto override this setting when starting the server. If you change this directive, you must stop your server and thenstart it again for the change to take effect.The server will not pick up the change if you only restart it. Example    Port 8080 Initial configuration file setting The number you specified for Port during installation.The installation default is 80. ServerRoot - Specify the directory where the server program is installed Use this directive to specify thedirectory where the server program is installed. Example    ServerRoot   d:\webserve\BIN Initial configuration file setting The directory name you specified forExecutables directory during installation.The installation default is:    ServerRoot  C:\WWW\BIN Note: PASS and EXEC rules may be independent of this directory. Directories and Welcome Page - Set viewing options Directories and Welcome Page Use the directives described in this section to control howyour server responds to requests containing a directory name.You can have the server search the directory for a welcome file toreturn, or you can have the server generate a directory listing. By default, the server first looks for a welcome file.If no welcome file is present, the server displays a directory listing.Configuration settings control how directory listings appearand the icons that the listings use. The server provides a set of defaulticons to use for directory listings.You can replace these icons with others usingsome of the directives described in this section. AddBlankIcon - Specify the icon URL used to align the heading of directory listings Use this directive to specify an icon to usefor aligning the heading on directory listings.This can either be a blank icon or another iconyou want to appear on the headings of your directory listings.For proper alignment, the icon you use must be the same sizeas the other icons you are using on your directory listings.The format of the directive is:    AddBlankIcon   icon-URL   alternate-text icon-URL The last part of the URL for the icon.The server adds this value to the value of the IconPathdirective to form the complete URL request.If the request is for a local file, the server translates therequest through the mapping directives.For the icon to be retrieved, the mapping directivesmust allow the request to be passed. If you are using the server as a proxy, the complete request must bea fully qualified URL pointing to your server. alternate-text The alternate text to use for the icon if the requestingbrowser is not displaying graphics. Example    AddBlankIcon logo.gif  logo Initial configuration file setting    AddBlankIcon   blank.gif The default does not specify alternative text since the icon is blank. AddDirIcon - Specify the icon URL for directories on directory listings Use this directive to specify an icon for representinga directory on a directory listing.The format of the directive is:    AddDirIcon   icon-URL   alternate-text icon-URL The last part of the URL for the icon.The server adds this value to the value of the IconPathdirective to form the complete URL request.If the request is for a local file, the server translates therequest through the mapping directives.For the icon to be retrieved, the mapping directivesmust allow the request to be passed. If you are using the server as a proxy, the complete request must bea fully qualified URL pointing to your server.You must map the URL to a local file and make surethat the mapping directives allow the URL to be passed. alternate-text The alternate text to use for the icon if the requestingbrowser is not displaying graphics. Example    AddDirIcon  direct.gif  DIR Initial configuration file setting    AddDirIcon  dir.gif    DIR AddIcon - Bind an icon to a MIME content-type or encoding-type Use this directive to specify icons for representing fileswith a specific MIME content-type or encoding-type.The server uses the icons on directory listings.The format of the directive is:    AddIcon   icon-URL   alternate-text   type-template icon-URL The last part of the URL for the icon.The server adds this value to the value of the IconPathdirective to form the complete URL request.If the request is for a local file, the server translates therequest through the mapping directives.For the icon to be retrieved, the mapping directivesmust allow the request to be passed. If you are using the server as a proxy, the complete request must bea fully qualified URL pointing to your server.You must map the URL to a local file and make surethat the mapping directives allow the URL to be passed. alternate-text The alternate text to use for the icon if the requestingbrowser is not displaying graphics. type-template Either a MIME content-type or encoding-type template.Content-type templates always contain a slash.Encoding-type templates never have a slash. Example    AddIcon   movie.gif    video   video/* Initial configuration file setting    AddIcon   binary.gif          BIN     binary   AddIcon   text.gif            TXT     text/*   AddIcon   image.gif           IMG     image/*   AddIcon   movie.gif           MOV     video/*   AddIcon   sound.gif           AU      audio/*   AddIcon   tar.gif             AR      multipart/*tar   AddIcon   compress.gif        MP      x-compress x-gzip AddParentIcon - Specify the icon URL for a parent directory on directory listings Use this directive to specify an icon for representinga parent directory on a directory listing.The format of the directive is:    AddParentIcon   icon-URL   alternate-text icon-URL The last part of the URL for the icon.The server adds this value to the value of the IconPathdirective to form the complete URL request.If the request is for a local file, the server translates therequest through the mapping directives.For the icon to be retrieved, the mapping directivesmust allow the request to be passed. If you are using the server as a proxy, the complete request must bea fully qualified URL pointing to your server.You must map the URL to a local file and make surethat the mapping directives allow the URL to be passed. alternate-text The alternate text to use for the icon if the requestingbrowser is not displaying graphics. Example    AddParentIcon  parent.gif  UP Initial configuration file setting    AddParentIcon  back.gif    UP AddUnknownIcon - Specify the icon URL for unknown file types on directory listings Use this directive to specify an icon for representingfiles with an unknown file type on a directory listing.The format of the directive is:    AddUnknownIcon   icon-URL   alternate-text icon-URL The last part of the URL for the icon.The server adds this value to the value of the IconPathdirective to form the complete URL request.If the request is for a local file, the server translates therequest through the mapping directives.For the icon to be retrieved, the mapping directivesmust allow the request to be passed. If you are using the server as a proxy, the complete request must bea fully qualified URL pointing to your server.You must map the URL to a local file and make sure thatthe mapping directives allow the URL to be passed. alternate-text The alternate text to use for the icon if the requestingbrowser is not displaying graphics. Example    AddUnknownIcon saywhat.gif  huh Initial configuration file setting     AddUnknownIcon unknown.gif   ??? AlwaysWelcome - Specify if a welcome file is returned for all directory requests Use this directive to specify if you want your server to always handledirectory requests by first searching the directory for a welcome file. The default value is On, which means that the server alwayssearches the directory for a welcome file.The Welcome directive specifies the names of the files thatthe server recognizes as welcome files. If you change the value to Off,the server first checks the last characterof directory requests for the slash (/) character.If a directory request ends with a slash, the server searchesthe directory for a welcome file.If a directory request does not end with a slash, the serverattempts to return a directory listing. If the server does not find a welcome file, or AlwaysWelcomeis set to Off and the directory request does not end in a slash,the DirAccess directive controls whether or not the serverresponds to the request with a directory listing. Note: Setting AlwaysWelcome to Off does not affect requests that containonly your server name without a directory name.The server will always handle these requests by looking in your documentroot directory for a welcome file.The server cannot generate a directory listing for the documentroot directory. Example    AlwaysWelcome Off Initial configuration file setting    AlwaysWelcome On DirAccess - Control directory listings Use this directive to specify whether you want your serverto return directory listings when requested.The values on the Welcome and AlwaysWelcome directives determinewhen a request is interpreted as a request for a directory listing. The default value is On, which means that the servercan return directory listings for all directories and subdirectories.If you want to control which directories and subdirectories theserver can return directory listings for, use:    DirAccess   Selective If you change the value to Off,the server will not return directory listings. If you change the value to Selective,the server will return directory listings for anydirectory that contains a file named .www_browsable.The contents of the .www_browsable fileare not important; the server only checks for its existence. Examples:    DirAccess Off   DirAccess Selective Initial configuration file setting    DirAccess On DirReadme - Control directory README files Use this directive to specify if and where you wantyour server to display directory listing README files. The default value is Top, which means thatwhen the server returns a directory listing,it searches the directory for a file named README.If README is found, the server puts the contents of thefile at the top of the directory listing. If you change the value to Bottom,the server searches for a README file, but puts the contentsat the bottom of the directory listing. If you change the value to Off, the serverdoes not search the directory for a README file. Examples:    DirReadme Bottom   DirReadme Off Initial configuration file setting    DirReadme Top DirShowBrackets - Use brackets around alternative text on directory listings Use this directive to specify whether you want the server to putbrackets around alternative text on directory listings.The directives that specify directory listing icons alsocontain alternate text.The alternate text is used in place of an iconif the requesting browser is not displaying graphics. Example    DirShowBrackets Off Initial configuration file setting    DirShowBrackets On DirShowBytes - Show byte count for small files on directory listings Use this directive to specify whether directory listings should includethe exact byte count for files smaller than 1 KB. A value of Off means the directory listing shows a size of1 KB for all files that are 1 KB or smaller. Example    DirShowBytes On Initial configuration file setting    DirShowBytes Off DirShowCase - Use case when sorting files on directory listings Use this directive to specify whether directory listingsshould distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letterswhen sorting file names. A value of On means uppercase letters are placedbefore lowercase letters. Example    DirShowCase Off Initial configuration file setting    DirShowCase On DirShowDate - Show date last modified on directory listings Use this directive to specify whether directory listings should includethe last modification date for each file. Example    DirShowDate Off Initial configuration file setting    DirShowDate On DirShowDescription - Show descriptions for files on directory listings Use this directive to specify whether directory listings should includedescriptions for HTML files.The descriptions are taken from the files' HTML <title> tags. Example    DirShowDescription Off Initial configuration file setting    DirShowDescription On DirShowHidden - Show hidden files on directory listings Use this directive to specify whether directory listings should includeany hidden files on the directory. The server considers the following to be hidden files: Any file with the hidden attribute turned on Any file that has a name beginning with a period (.) Example    DirShowHidden Off Initial configuration file setting    DirShowHidden On DirShowIcons - Show icons in directory listings Use this directive to specify whether you want your serverto include icons in directory listings.Icons can be used to provide a graphicrepresentation of the content type of the files in the listing.The icons themselves are defined by the AddBlankIcon, AddDirIcon,AddIcon, AddParentIcon, and AddUnknownIcon directives. Example    DirShowIcons Off Initial configuration file setting    DirShowIcons On DirShowMaxDescrLength - Set the maximum description length on directory listings Use this directive to set the maximum number of charactersto show in the description field on directory listings. Example    DirShowMaxDescrLength 30 Initial configuration file setting    DirShowMaxDescrLength 25 DirShowMaxLength - Set the maximum length for file names on directory listings Use this directive to set the maximum number of charactersthat will be used for file names on directory listings. Example    DirShowMaxLength 30 Initial configuration file setting    DirShowMaxLength 25 DirShowMinLength - Set the minimum length for file names on directory listings Use this directive to set the minimum number of charactersthat will always be reserved for file names on directory listings.File names in the directory can exceed this number. However,file names cannot be longer than the number specified on theDirShowMaxLength directive. Example    DirShowMinLength 10 Initial configuration file setting    DirShowMinLength 15 DirShowSize - Show file size on directory listings Use this directive to specify whether directory listingsshould include the size of each file. Example    DirShowSize Off Initial configuration file setting    DirShowSize On IconPath - Specify the path for the directory listing internal icons Use this directive to specify URL information to be added at thebeginning of each icon-URL specified on an AddBlankIcon,AddDirIcon, AddParentIcon, AddUnknownIcon, or AddIcon directive.The value you specify on this directive is added to theicon-URL value on each of the other directivesto form the full request for the icon.The full request can be mapped to a file on your serveror it can be a request to another server. Attention: This directive must be before anyof the other icon directives(AddBlankIcon, AddDirIcon, AddParentIcon, AddUnknownIcon, and AddIcon). Example    IconPath http://icon.server.com:8080/httpd-internal-icons/ In the above example, each request for a directory list icongenerates a request to a server named icon.server.com.    IconPath  /icons/ With the default settings, each request for a directory list icongenerates a request that begins with /icons/.The server uses its mapping rules to map the request to a local file. Welcome - Specify names of welcome files Use this directive to specify the name of a welcome filethe server should look for to respond to requests thatdo not contain a specific file name.You can build a list of welcome files by putting multipleoccurrences of this directive in the configuration file. For requests that do not contain a file name or a directory name, theserver always looks in the document root directory for a file thatmatches a name specified on a Welcome directive.If a match is found, the file is returned to the requester. For requests that contain a directory name but not a file name,the AlwaysWelcome directive controls whether the serverlooks in the directory for a welcome file to return.By default, AlwaysWelcome is set to a value of On.This means the server always looks in the requested directoryfor a file matching a name specified on a Welcome directive.If a match is found, the file is returned to the requester. If the server finds more than one match between files in a directoryand file names on Welcome directives, the order of the Welcomedirectives determines which file is returned.The server uses the Welcome directive closestto the top of the configuration file. If the server does not find a welcome file in the directory,the DirAccess directive controls whether or not the serverresponds to the request with a directory listing. The format of the Welcome directive is:   Welcome file-name [Server-IP-address or hostname] file-name A file name you want to define as being a welcome file. Server-IP-address or hostname If you are using multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,use this parameter to specify an IP address ora host name.(For more information on using multiple IP addresses or virtualhosts, see "Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts".)The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the serveron this IP address or for this host.For an IP address, this is the address of theserver's network connection,not the address of the requesting client. You can specify an IP address (for example, 204.146.167.72)or you can specify a host name (for example, hostA.bcd.com). This parameter is optional.Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for allrequests regardless of the IP address the requests come in onor the host name in the URLs. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Examples:    Welcome letsgo.html   Welcome Welcome.html The above example defines two welcome pages and assumes theAlwaysWelcome directive is set to its default of On.For requests that do not contain a file name, the server would try toreturn a welcome file from the directory specified on the request(or document root directory if the request does not specify afile name or a directory).The server would first look for a file named letsgo.html.If the directory does not have a letsgo.html file, the server wouldlook for a file named Welcome.html.    Welcome CustomerA.html  9.67.106.79   Welcome CustomerB.html  9.83.100.45 Your server would look for different welcome files based onthe IP address of the network connection the request comes in on.For requests coming in on 9.67.106.79 the server would look forwelcome files named CustomerA.html.For requests coming in on 9.83.100.45,the server would look for welcome files named CustomerB.html.If the request comes in on a different IP address, the server looksfor the default address.    Welcome CustomerA.html  hostA.bcd.com   Welcome CustomerB.html  hostB.bcd.com Your server would look for different welcome files based onthe host name in the URL.For requests coming in for hostA, the server would look forwelcome files named CustomerA.html.For requests coming in for hostB,the server would look for welcome files named CustomerB.html.If the request comes in for a different host, the server looksfor the default host name. Initial configuration file setting    Welcome Welcome.html   Welcome welcome.html   Welcome index.html   Welcome Frntpage.html The above default values are shown in the order used by thedefault configuration. User directories Use the directives described in this section to control whetherindividual users of your server can have their own private Web documents. HomeDir - Specify the directory that contains user subdirectories Use this directive to specify the name of a directory on whichyou want to allow individual users to have their own subdirectories.Each user can have a subdirectory off of the directory name you specify.URL requests to user subdirectories are in the format~username.The server passes these requests to the appropriate user subdirectoryon the HomeDir directory. You can use the HomeDir directive either by itself or togetherwith the UserDir directive.Whether or not you use UserDir determines how theserver maps URL requests to the user subdirectories. If you use HomeDir without UserDir,all files within the user subdirectories are accessible to clients.See the description of the UserDir directivefor a description and example of using HomeDir with UserDir. Note: By using this directive, you are telling the serverto process all requests to user subdirectories.You do not need to put any additionalPass directives in the configuration file. Example    HomeDir  c:\user In the above example, the server would mapURL requests containing /~username to thec:\user\username directory. Initial Configuration File Setting None.By default the server does not accept requests to user subdirectories. UserDir - Specify the name of the accessible subdirectory off of user subdirectories Use this directive to specify the name of a subdirectorywhere individual users can keep the files they want tobe accessible to clients of the server.This directive limits client access to just one subdirectorywithin each user subdirectory.Each individual subdirectory off of the HomeDir directorycan have a subdirectory with the name you specify. To use this directive, you must also use the HomeDirdirective. For example, you might want to use this directive if yourserver has access to a LAN server where users have home directories.You can use this directive to define one subdirectory off of eachuser directory where users could keep Web pages they want to beaccessible. Example    HomeDir  c:\user   UserDir  html_doc In the above example the server would map URL requestscontaining /~username to thec:\user\username\html_doc directory. Initial Configuration File Setting None Logging and Reporting - Customize access and error logs and generate access reports Logging and Reporting Use the directives described in this section tocontrol your server's logs.You can have the server log incoming requests and server errors.If your server is running as a caching proxy server, you can logaccess requests for files from the proxy server's cache. You can specify the path and file where you want these logs to be kept,how requests should be logged, and which requests you do not want to log. You can view the access, error, and trace logs from the server window.Although by default the access log will not write to the serverwindow by default to ensure better server performance, you can changethis by setting the LogToGUI directive to On. You most likely will want to use the common log format.This is the default format and it is the same formatused by most other types of Web servers.If you plan to use the access log report function, you are required touse the common log format. AccessLog - Name the path for the access log file Use this directive to specify the path and file namewhere you want the server to log access statistics.By default, the server writes an entry to this log each timea client sends the server a request.You can use the NoLog directive if you do not wantto log requests from certain clients.For a description of the NoLog directive, refer to "NoLog - Suppress log entries for specific hosts or domains matching a template". The server starts a new log file each day at midnight if it is running.Otherwise, the server starts a new log filethe first time you start it on a given day.When creating the file, theserver uses the file name you specify and appends a date extension.The date extension is in the format Mmmddyyyy, where Mmmis the first three letters of the month; dd is the day of themonth; and yyyy is the year. It is a good idea to remove old log files, because they can takeup a significant amount of space on your hard drive.For information about removing old log files,refer to "AccessLogArchive - Remove existing access, agent, or referer log files or run a user exit". Example    AccessLog  c:\server\logs\accesslog Initial configuration file setting    AccessLog  c:\path\httpd-log c:\path\ is the value you enteredfor Logs directory at installation.The installation default is c:\WWW\LOGS AccessLogArchive - Remove existing access, agent, or referer log files or run a user exit Values specified on the AccessLogArchive directive apply to access,agent, and referer logs.The collective size includes the size of all access logs or all agentlogs or all referer logs, not the collective size of all types of logs. At midnight each night, the server closes the current logand creates a new log file for the coming day.You can choose to do one of the following actions with the closedlogs: Remove log files of a given age or when a given amountof storage is used by the collection of log files Allow closed logs to remain on your hard drive Branch to a user exit To remove access, agent, or refererlogs of a given age, specify this directive,in addition to the AccessLogExpire directive.To remove logs when their collective size exceedsa certain amount of storage, specify this directive,in addition to the AccessLogSizeLimit directive. To allow closed logs to remain on your hard drive,you can accept the default, which is AccessLogArchive none. To branch to a user exit, specify the path to the user exit and anyparameters for the user exit on the AccessLogArchive directive.The server will append to this directive the path to the access, agent,or referer log. The AccessLogArchive directive can be specified in any of thefollowing formats:    AccessLogArchive   purge   AccessLogArchive   none   AccessLogArchive   userexit path_to_the_user-exit_program [parameters for the   user-exit] purge Remove access log files of a given age orwhen their collective size exceeds a given amount of storage. none Do not remove access log files.none is the default. userexit Specifies the path of the user-exit program you want to branch to.You can optionally specify the parameters for your user-exit program,as shown in the following examples.The server appends the path to the access log to the directive. Examples:    AccessLogArchive purge   AccessLogArchive none   AccessLogArchive userexit c:\accback\backup.exe -d -a For the AccessLogArchive userexit example, theuser exit invocation is:    AccessLogArchive userexit c:\accback\backup.exe -d -a c:\www\logs\httpd-log Initial configuration file setting    AccessLogArchive none Program default setting None. AccessLogExcludeURL - Suppress log entries for specific files or directories Use this directive to specify that you do not wantto log access requests made for specific files or directoriesthat match a given URL template.For example, you might not want to log access requestsfor GIF files or you might not want to log access requeststo a particular file or directory on your server. You can have multiple occurrences of this directive in yourconfiguration file.You can also put multiple entries for the same directiveif you separate them by one or more spaces. Example    AccessLogExcludeURL  *.gif   AccessLogExcludeURL  /Freebies/* Initial configuration file setting None.The server includes in the access logrequests for all files and directories. Program default setting None. AccessLogExcludeMethod - Suppress log entries for files or directories requested by a given method Use this directive to specify that you do not want to log access requestsmade for files or directories by using a specific method.For example, you might not want to log DELETE requests for filesor directories. You can have multiple occurrences of this directive in yourconfiguration file.You can also put multiple methods on the same directive if you separatethem by one or more spaces. Example    AccessLogExcludeMethod GET   AccessLogExcludeMethod PUT   AccessLogExcludeMethod POST   AccessLogExcludeMethod DELETE Initial configuration file setting None.The server includes in the access log the files anddirectories requested by all types of methods. Program default setting None. AccessLogExcludeMimeType - Suppress log entries for specific MIME types Use this directive to specify that you do not want to log access requestsmade for directories or files of a given MIME type.(Examples of MIME types are text/html, image/gif, and image/jpeg.)For example, you might not want to log access requests for GIF images. You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein your configuration file.You can also put multiple MIME types on the same directiveif you separate them by one or more spaces. Example    AccessLogExcludeMimeType image/gif Initial configuration file setting None.The access log includes requests to the server for filesand directories of all MIME types. Program default setting None. AccessLogExcludeReturnCode - Suppress log entries for specific return codes Use this directive to specify that you do not want to log accessrequests that fall within a given range of error code numbers.These error code numbers are httpd status codes.You cannot specify individual codes.Specifying 300 indicates that you want to exclude access requestswith redirection return codes (301, 302, 303, and 304).To exclude these requests, you would specify: AccessLogExcludeReturnCode 300 You can have multiple occurrencesof this directive in your configuration file.You can also put multiple return codes on the same directiveif you separate them by one or more spaces. Example    AccessLogExcludeReturnCode 300 Initial configuration file setting None.The access log includes all requeststo the server, regardless of the code. Program default setting None. AccessLogExpire - Remove existing access log files when they reach a given age in days Use this directive to specify that you want to remove access log fileswhen they reach a certain age (in days). This directive requires that you also specify the AccessLogArchivedirective, described under "AccessLogArchive - Remove existing access, agent, or referer log files or run a user exit".You can have only one occurrence of this directivein your configuration file. The format of the AccessLogExpire directive is:    AccessLogExpire   number-of-days number-of-days Specifies that access logs older than this value are to be removed.number-of-days must be an integer;decimal values such as 1.5 are not valid.The default is 0, a value that indicatesthat no expiration date exists. The file creation date, as reported by the operating system,is used to determine the age of the access log file.The suffix of the filename, such ashttpd-log.Mar221996.extension, isnot used to determine file age.(extension is the file extension.) Example    AccessLogExpire 10 Initial configuration file setting    AccessLogExpire 0 Program default setting None. AccessLogSizeLimit - Remove existing access log files when they reach a given collective size Use this directive to specify that you want to remove access log fileswhen they reach a collective size (in megabytes). This directive requires that you also specify the AccessLogArchivedirective, described under "AccessLogArchive - Remove existing access, agent, or referer log files or run a user exit".You can have only one occurrence of this directivein your configuration file. The format of the AccessLogSizeLimit directive is:    AccessLogSizeLimit   number-of-megabytes number-of-megabytes Specifies that when the combined size of the access log filesexceeds this value, files are deleted starting with the oldest file,until the collective size is within the limit specifiedon the AccessLogSizeLimit directive.number-of-megabytes must be an integer.The default is 0, a value that indicatesthat no access log files are to be removed. This directive takes effect after theAccessLogExpire directive has taken effect. Example    AccessLogSizeLimit 4 Initial configuration file setting    AccessLogSizeLimit 0 Program default setting None. AccessReportDescription - Give a short description of the report to be created Use this directive to include a short descriptionof the report to be created with this template. Example    AccessReportDescription   Report on Web page accesses Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting None. AccessReportExcludeURL - Suppress from the report the log entries for specific files or directories Use this directive to specify that you do not want to includein the access report requests made for specific files ordirectories that match a given URL template.For example, you might not want to include in the report access requestsfor GIF files or you might not want to include access requeststo a particular file or directory on your server. You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein your configuration file. Example    AccessReportExcludeURL *.gif   AccessReportExcludeURL oldfiles* Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting None. AccessReportIncludeURL - Include in the report only log entries for specific files or directories Use this directive to specify that you want to include in theaccess report only access requests made for specific files ordirectories that match a given URL template.For example, you might want to include in the report only access requestsfor HTML files or you might want to include access requeststo a particular file or directory on your server. You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein your configuration file. Example    AccessReportIncludeURL /*.html Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting None. AccessReportExcludeHostName - Suppress from the report the log entries for specific host names Use this directive to specify that you do not want to include in theaccess report requests made by host names or IP addressesthat match a given template. You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein your configuration file. Note: To exclude host names,you must set the DNS-Lookup directive to On.If the DNS-Lookup directive is set to Off (the default),you can exclude IP addresses only. Example    AccessReportExcludeHostName 9.85.*.*   AccessReportExcludeHostName *.edu Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting None. AccessReportIncludeHostName - Include in the report only log entries for specific host names Use this directive to specify that you want to include in theaccess report requests made by host names or IP addressesthat match a given template. You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein your configuration file. Note: To include host names,you must set the DNS-Lookup directive to On.If the DNS-Lookup directive is set to Off (the default),you can include IP addresses only. Example    AccessReportIncludeHostName 9.9.99.*   AccessReportIncludeHostName *.com Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting None. AccessReportExcludeMethod - Suppress from the report the log entries of a given method type Use this directive to specify that you do not want to includein the access report requests of a given method type. You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein your configuration file. Example    AccessReportExcludeMethod GET   AccessReportExcludeMethod PUT   AccessReportExcludeMethod POST Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting None. AccessReportExcludeReturnCode - Suppress from the report the log entries with a given return code Use this directive to specify that you do not want to includein the access report requests that fall within a given rangeof error code numbers.These error code numbers are httpd status codes.You cannot specify individual return codes.Specifying 300 indicates that you want to exclude from the reportaccess requests with redirection return codes (301, 302, 303, and 304).To exclude these requests from the report, you would specify AccessReportxcludeReturnCode 300 You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein your configuration file. Syntax:    AccessReportExcludeReturnCode return code Example    AccessReportExcludeReturnCode 200   AccessReportExcludeReturnCode 400 Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting None. AccessReportRoot - Name the path for the root directory where access log reports are stored Use this directive to specify the path and file name where you wantthe server to store access log reports and summary databases.We recommend that you accept the default path.If you choose to specify a different path, you will needto create the new directory with all the appropriate permissionsand add a PASS directive to enable the server to honor requestsfor reports in that directory. If you are running with workload management enabled, you shouldhave unique AccessReportRoot directives for each instance of httpdbased on the subsystem name. If you specify -SN system1, you shouldhave AccessReportRoot /usr/lpp/internet/server_root/pub/reports/system1and a corresponding Pass directive. Example    AccessReportRoot C:\WWW\BIN\REPORTS Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting None. AccessReportTemplate - Name the report template Use this directive to specify the name of the report template.There is a default template named "Top50".For more information, see "Tailoring the reports your server creates". The format of the AccessReportTemplate is:    AccessReportTemplate report_title report_title The name of the report.The name cannot include any blanks. Example    AccessReportTemplate PageHits Initial configuration file setting AccessReportTemplate  Top50    {AccessReportDescription        Top 50 most frequently requested files                                and most frequent visitorsAccessReportTopList            50                               } Program default setting None. AccessReportTopList - Specify the top number of items on which to report Use this directive to specify the top number of items on which to report. The format of the AccessReportTopList is:    AccessReportTopList top_number|all top_number Specifies that the report is to include the top_numbermost frequently occurring entries in the access log.This must be an integer value. all Specifies that the report is to include all entries in the report. Example    AccessReportTopList 10 Initial configuration file setting None. Program default setting None. AgentLog - Name the path for the agent log file Use this directive to specify the path and file namewhere you want the server to log statistics about which Web browserwas used to access a Web page.By default the server writes an entry to this log each timea client sends the server a request.For every entry made in the access log,the agent log has a correspondingentry that indicates the browser used to display thepage or file requested by the client. The server starts a new agentlog file each day at midnight if it is running.Otherwise, the server starts a new log filethe first time you start it on a given day.When creating the file, theserver uses the file name you specify and appends a date extension.The date extension is in the format Mmmddyyyy, where Mmmis the first three letters of the month; dd is the day of themonth; and yyyy is the year. Example    AgentLog  c:\server\logs\agent-log Initial configuration file setting    AgentLog  c:\path\agent-log c:\path\ is the value you enteredfor Logs directory at installation.The installation default is c:\WWW\LOGS Program default setting None. CacheAccessLog - Specify the path for the cache access log files If the server is running as a proxy, you can log requests to thecache separately from other requests.Use the CacheAccessLog directive to specify the path and file namewhere you want the server to put access requests for cached files.To enable logging of requests to the proxy cache,the following directives must be defined: Caching must be turned ON (default is OFF) CacheRoot (by default, no CacheRoot is defined) CacheAccessLog The value of CacheAccessLog can either be an absolute pathor a path relative to ServerRoot (one example is shown of each). Note: If you choose to use CacheAccessLog, access requestsfor cached files are logged, but they are not includedin the access reports.Access reports contain only information fromaccess logs, not from cache access logs.Therefore, if you want access reports to contain access requestsfor cached files, do not specify the CacheAccessLog directive. The server starts a new log file each day at midnight if it is running.Otherwise, the server starts a new log filethe first time you start it on a given day.When creating the file, the server usesthe file name you specify and appends a date extension.The date extension is in the format Mmmddyyyy,where Mmm is the first three letters of the month;dd is the day of the month; and yyyy is the year. Note: It is a good idea to occasionally check the paththat contains your log files.If your server has a large amount of activity, your log files could growto the point that they cause your server to run out of disk space.Make sure the files are not taking up too much space anddelete the log files you no longer need. The format of this directive is CacheAccessLog  <file_path> Example    CacheAccessLog  c:\absolute\path\logfile   CacheAccessLog  c:\logs\logfile Initial configuration file setting None.The server does not log cache access requests unlessyou include this directive in your configuration file. Program default setting None. CgiErrorLog - Name the path for the CGI error log file Use this directive to specify the path and file namewhere you want the server to log standard error output (stderr) from CGIprograms. The server starts a new CGI errorfile each day at midnight if it is running.Otherwise, the server starts a new log filethe first time you start it on a given day.When creating the file, theserver uses the file name you specify and appends a date extension.The date extension is in the format Mmmddyyyy, where Mmmis the first three letters of the month; dd is the day of themonth; and yyyy is the year. Example    CgiErrorLog  c:\server\logs\cgi-error Initial configuration file setting    CgiErrorLog c:\path\cgi-error c:\path\ is the value you enteredfor Logs directory at installation.The installation default is c:\WWW\LOGS Program default setting None. ErrorLog - Name the file where you want to log internal server errors Use this directive to specify the path and file namewhere you want the server to log internal errors. The server starts a new log file each day at midnight if it is running.Otherwise, the server starts a new log filethe first time you start it on a given day.When creating the file, the server usesthe file name you specify and appends a date extension.The date extension is in the format Mmmddyyyy,where Mmm is the first three letters of the month;dd is the day of the month; and yyyy is the year. Note: If your server has a large amount of activity, your log files could growto the point that they cause your server to run out of disk space.To prevent the files from taking up too much space, you can specifythe ErrorLogArchive directive described under "ErrorLogArchive - Remove existing error or CGI error log files or run a user exit". Example    ErrorLog c:\server\logs\errorlog Initial configuration file setting    ErrorLog  c:\path\httpd-error c:\path\ is the value you enteredfor Logs directory at installation.The installation default is c:\WWW\LOGS Program default setting None. ErrorLogArchive - Remove existing error or CGI error log files or run a user exit Values specified on the ErrorLogArchive directive apply to error andCGI error logs.The collective size includes the size of all error logs or all CGIlogs, not the collective size of both types of logs. At midnight each night, the server closes the current error and CGI errorlogs and creates a new log files for the coming day.You can choose to do one of the following actionswith the closed error logs: Remove log files of a given age or when a given amountof storage is used by the collection of error log files Allow closed logs to remain on your hard drive Branch to a user exit. To remove logs of a given age, specifythis directive, in addition to the ErrorLogExpire directive.To remove logs when their collective size exceedsa certain amount of storage, specify this directive,in addition to the ErrorLogSizeLimit directive. To allow closed logs to remain on your hard drive, youcan accept the default, which is ErrorLogArchive none. To branch to a user exit, specify the path to the user exit and anyparameters for the user exit on the ErrorLogArchive directive.The server will append to this directive the path to the error or CGIerror log. The ErrorLogArchive directive can be specifiedin any of the following formats:    ErrorLogArchive   purge   ErrorLogArchive   none   ErrorLogArchive   userexit path_to_the_user-exit program [parameters for the   user-exit] purge Remove log files of a given age orwhen their collective size exceeds a given amount of storage. none Do not remove log files.none is the default. userexit Specifies the path of the user-exit program you want to branch to.You can optionally specify the parameters for your user-exit program,as shown in the following examples.The server appends the path to the error log to the directive. Examples:    ErrorLogArchive purge   ErrorLogArchive none   ErrorLogArchive userexit c:\errback\backup.exe -d -a For the ErrorLogArchive userexit example,the user exit invocation is:    ErrorLogArchive userexit c:\errback\backup.exe -d -a c:\www\logs\httpd-error Initial configuration file setting    ErrorLogArchive none Program default setting None. ErrorLogExpire - Remove existing error log files when they reach a given age in days Use this directive to specify that you want to remove error log fileswhen they reach a certain age (in days). This directive requires that you also specify the ErrorLogArchivedirective, described under "ErrorLogArchive - Remove existing error or CGI error log files or run a user exit".You can have only one occurrence of this directivein your configuration file. The format of the ErrorLogExpire directive is:    ErrorLogExpire   number-of-days number-of-days Specifies that error logs older than this value are to be removed.number-of-days must be an integer;decimal values such as 1.5 are not valid.The default is 0, a value that indicatesthat no expiration date exists. The file creation date, as reported by the operating system,is used to determine the age of the error log file.The suffix of the filename, such as httpd-log.Mar221996,is not used to determine file age. Example    ErrorLogExpire 10 Initial configuration file setting    ErrorLogExpire 0 Program default setting None. ErrorLogSizeLimit - Remove existing error log files when they reach a given collective size Use this directive to specify that you want to remove error log fileswhen they reach a collective size (in megabytes). This directive requires that you also specify the ErrorLogArchivedirective, described under "ErrorLogArchive - Remove existing error or CGI error log files or run a user exit".You can have only one occurrence of this directivein your configuration file. The format of the ErrorLogSizeLimit directive is:    ErrorLogSizeLimit   number-of-megabytes number-of-megabytes Specifies that when the sum total size of the error log filesexceeds this value, files are deleted starting with the oldest file,until the collective size is within the limit specifiedon the ErrorLogSizeLimit directive.number-of-megabytes must be an integer.The default is 0, a value that indicatesthat no error log files are to be removed. This directive takes effect afterthe ErrorLogExpire directive has taken effect. Example    ErrorLogSizeLimit 4 Initial configuration file setting    ErrorLogSizeLimit 0 Program default setting None. LogFormat - Specify common or old log file format Use this directive to specify whether you want your serverto write log files in the common format or old format. If you plan to use the reporting functions described under"Tailoring the reports your server creates", you must accept the default file format, common. The common format is the one used by most Web servers.The old format was used with early versions of Web servers from CERN.You most likely will want to use the common format,which is the default. Example    LogFormat Old Initial configuration file setting    LogFormat Common Program default setting Common. LogTime - Specify GMT or local time stamps in log files Use this directive to specify whether your logs should recordentries using local time or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Example    LogTime GMT Initial configuration file setting    LogTime LocalTime Program default setting LocalTime. LogToGUI - Specify whether access log writes to GUI Use this directive to specify whether you want your serverto write access log files to the server window(also known as graphical user interface or GUI).The default setting of OFF improves server performance. Example    LogToGUI On Initial configuration file setting    LogToGUI Off Program default setting Off. NoLog - Suppress log entries for specific hosts or domains matching a template Use this directive to specify that you do not want to log accessrequests made from specific hosts or domains that match a given template.For example, you may not want to log access requests from local hosts. You can have multiple occurrencesof this directive in your configuration file.You can also put multiple templates on the same directiveif you separate them by one or more spaces.You can use host names or IP number addresses on the templates. Note: To use host name templates,you must set the DNS-Lookup directive to On.If the DNS-Lookup directive is set to Off (the default),you can use IP address templates only. Example    NoLog 128.141.*  *.edu  localhost.* Initial configuration file setting None Program default setting None. RefererLog - Name the path for the referer log file Use this directive to specify the path and file namewhere you want the server log the identity of the Web page thatreferred to (linked to) the requested Web page.By default the server writes an entry to this log each timea client sends the server a request.For every entry made in the access log,the referer log has a correspondingentry that indicates which page referred to the pagethat was requested by the client.If no page referred to the requested page, the entry is two quotationmarks (" "). The server starts a new referer logfile each day at midnight if it is running.Otherwise, the server starts a new log filethe first time you start it on a given day.When creating the file, theserver uses the file name you specify and appends a date extension.The date extension is in the format Mmmddyyyy, where Mmmis the first three letters of the month; dd is the day of themonth; and yyyy is the year. Example    RefererLog  c:\server\logs\referer-log Initial configuration file setting    RefererLog c:\path\referer-log c:\path\ is the value you enteredfor Logs directory at installation.The installation default is c:\WWW\LOGS Program default setting None. ReportDataCompressionProgram - Specify path to the compression program Use this directive to specify the path to the compression program(such as PKZIP2, GZIP, or compress)and any program parameters for the compression program.Include any command line parameters on the same line.This compression program is to be used to compress access data log files. Example    ReportDataCompressionProgram c:\bin\pkunzip2 Initial configuration file setting    ReportDataCompressionProgram Program default setting None. ReportDataUnCompressionProgram - Specify path to the uncompression program Use this directive to specify the path to the uncompression program(such as UNZIP, GZIP, or uncompress)and any program parameters for the uncompression program.Include any command line parameters on the same line.This uncompressionprogram is to be used to uncompress access data log files. Example    ReportDataUnCompressionProgram c:\bin\pkunzip2 Initial configuration file setting    ReportDataUnCompressionProgram Program default setting None. ReportDataCompressionSuffix - Specify the suffix appended to the compressed file Use this directive to specify the suffix appended to the compressed file. Example    ReportDataCompressionSuffix .zip Initial configuration file setting    ReportDataCompressionSuffix Program default setting None. ReportProcessOldLogs - Check for old logs in the log directory Use this directive to indicate that you want the server to check for oldaccesslogs in the log directory that are not listed in the list of log filesthat have been processed into reports.With this directive, you can process old access log files by: Appending the data from the old access log files to existing reports Creating reports for all accesslog files and overwriting existing reports Creating a report for the most recently created access log file. The format of the ReportProcessOldLogs directive is:    ReportProcessOldLogs append|force|last append Add to existing access log reports data fromlog files that werenot originally included in the reports. force Overwrite existing access log reports with reports based on datafrom all accesslog files, regardless of whether they were originially included in thereports. Note: The only way to erase reports namedaccess.mmddyyyy files is to archive them with theReportDataArchive directive, described under "ReportDataArchive - Specify whether to remove existing accessdata files". last Create reports based on data from the most recently created accesslog file. Examples    ReportProcessOldLogs append   ReportProcessOldLogs force   ReportProcessOldLogs last Initial configuration file setting    ReportProcessOldLogs append Program default setting None. ReportDataSizeLimit - Remove existing access data files when they reach a given collective size Use this directive to specify that you want to remove access data fileswhen they reach a collective size (in megabytes). This directive requires that you also specify the ReportDataArchivedirective, described under "AccessLogArchive - Remove existing access, agent, or referer log files or run a user exit".You can have only one occurrence of this directivein your configuration file. The format of the ReportDataSizeLimit directive is:    ReportDataSizeLimit   number-of-megabytes number-of-megabytes Specifies that when the sum total size of the access data filesexceeds this value, files are deleted starting with the oldest file,until the collective size is within the limit specifiedon the ReportDataSizeLimit directive.number-of-megabytes must be an integer.The default is 0, a value that indicatesthat no access data files are to be removed. This directive takes effect after theReportDataExpire directive has taken effect. Example    ReportDataSizeLimit 4 Initial configuration file setting    ReportDataSizeLimit 0 Program default setting None. ReportDataArchive - Specify whether to remove existing accessdata files Use this directive to specify whether you want to remove existingaccess data log files. If you want to remove access data files, you also need tospecify the ReportDataExpiredirective, described under "ReportDataExpire - Remove existing access data files when they reach a given age in days".You can have only one occurrence of this directive in your configurationfile. Even after you remove access data files, the data from these filesis still available for reports to use, until you specify theReportProcessOldLogs directive with the force option. The ReportDataArchive directive can be specified in any of the followingformats:    ReportDataArchive purge   ReportDataArchive none   ReportDataArchive   userexit path_to_the_user-exit_program [parameters for the   user-exit] purge Remove access data files of a given age orwhen their collective size exceeds a given amount of storage. none Do not remove access data files.none is the default. userexit Specifies the path of the user-exit program you want to branch to.You can optionally specify the parameters for your user-exit program,as shown in the following examples.The server appends the path to the access log to the directive. Examples:    ReportDataArchive purge   ReportDataArchive none   ReportDataArchive userexit c:\accback\backup.exe -d -a For the ReportDataArchive userexit example, theuser exit invocation is:    ReportDataArchive userexit c:\accback\backup.exe -d -a c:\www\logs\httpd-log Example    ReportDataArchive purge Initial configuration file setting    ReportDataArchive none None Program default setting None. ReportDataExpire - Remove existing access data files when they reach a given age in days Use this directive to specify that you want to remove access log datafiles when theyreach a certain age (in days). This directive requires that you also specify the ReportDataArchivedirective, described under "ReportDataArchive - Specify whether to remove existing accessdata files".You can have only one occurrence of this directive in your configurationfile.    ReportDataExpire   number-of-days number-of-days Specifies that reports older than this value are to be removed.number-of-days must be an integer;decimal values such as 1.5 are not valid.The default is 0, a value that indicatesthat no expiration date exists. The file creation date, as reported by the operating system,is used to determine the age of the error log file.The suffix of the filename, such as httpd-log.Mar221996,is not used to determine file age. Example    ReportDataExpire 10 Initial configuration file setting    ReportDataExpire 0 Program default setting None. Access control - Set up access control for the server Access control Use the directives described in this section tocontrol access to your server's resources. You link protection setups to groups of files based onthe requests that are used to access those files.Use the DefProt and Protect directivesto define the requests you want to protect. You can define the actual protection setup in a separateprotection statementor directly in the configuration file.Within the configuration file, you can define and labela protection setup using the Protection directive.You can also define a protection setup directlyon a DefProt or Protect directive. This section also describes the subdirectivesthat define a protection setup. See "Protecting your server" for step-by-step instructionson protecting your server resources. DefProt - Specify default protection setup for requests that match a template Use this directive to associate a default protectionsetup with requests that match a template. Attention: For protection to work properly,you must put your DefProt and Protect directivesbefore any Pass or Exec directives in your configuration file. The format of the directive is:   DefProt request-template setup [FOR Server-IP-address or hostname] request-template A template for requests that you want to associatewith a default protection setup.The server compares incoming client requests to the templateand associates a protection setup if there is a match. Protection is not actually activated for requests matchingthe template unless the request also matches a templateon a subsequent Protect directive.See the description of the Protect directive for anexplanation of how it is used with DefProt. setup The default protection setup you want to associatewith requests that match request-template.Protection setup is defined with protection subdirectives.See "Protection Subdirectives" for descriptionsof the protection subdirectives.This parameter can take one of three forms: A full path and file name identifying a separate filethat contains the protection subdirectives. A protection setup label name that matchesa name defined earlier on a Protection directive.The Protection directive contains the protection subdirectives. The actual protection subdirectives.The subdirectives must be enclosed in braces {}.The left brace character must be the last characteron the same line as the DefProt directive.Each subdirective follows on its own line.The right brace character must be on its own linefollowing the last subdirective line.You cannot put any comment lines between the braces. FOR Server-IP-address or hostname If you are using multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,use this parameter to specify an IP address ora host name.(For more information on using multiple IP addresses or virtualhosts, see "Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts".)The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the serveron this IP address or for this host.For an IP address, this is the address of theserver's network connection,not the address of the requesting client. You can specify an IP address (for example, FOR 204.146.167.72)or you can specify a host name (for example, FOR hostA.bcd.com). This parameter is optional.Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for allrequests regardless of the IP address the requests come in onor the host name in the URL. Notes: To use this parameter, the setup parameter must bein the form of a path and file name or a protection setup label.You cannot use protection subdirectives enclosed in bracesfor the setup parameter. To use this parameter, you must put FOR,or some other character string (without blanks),between the setup parameter and theIP-address or hostname. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Examples:    DefProt   /secret/*   d:\server\protect\setup1.acc    DefProt   /secret/*   SECRET-PROT The above example uses a label nameto point to the protection subdirectives.The label name must match a label name on a Protection directive.The Protection directive must come before the DefProt directive.    DefProt   {      AuthType Basic      ServerID restricted      PasswdFile d:\docs\WWW\restrict.pwd      GroupFile  d:\docs\WWW\restrict.grp      GetMask authors      PutMask authors   } The above example includes the protection subdirectivesas part of the DefProt directive.    DefProt   /secret/*   CustomerA-PROT   9.67.106.79   DefProt   /secret/*   CustomerB-PROT   9.83.100.45 The above examples use the optional IP address parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /secret/, itassociates a different default protection setup with the request basedon the IP address of the network connection the request comes in on.For requests coming in on 9.67.106.79, the server associatesthe request with default protection defined on aProtection directive with a label of CustomerA-PROT.For requests coming in on 9.83.100.45,the server associates the request with default protection defined on aProtection directive with a label of CustomerB-PROT.    DefProt   /secret/*   CustomerA-PROT   hostA.bcd.com   DefProt   /secret/*   CustomerB-PROT   hostB.bcd.com The above examples use the optional host name parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /secret/, itassociates a different default protection setup with the request basedon the host name in the URL.For requests coming in for hostA, the server associatesthe request with default protection defined on aProtection directive with a label of CustomerA-PROT.For requests coming in on hostB,the server associates the request with default protection defined on aProtection directive with a label of CustomerB-PROT. Program default setting None. Initial configuration file setting None. Protect - Activate protection setup for requests that match a template Use this directive to activate protection setup rules for requeststhat match a template. Attention: For protection to work properly,you must put your DefProt and Protect directivesbefore any Pass or Exec directives in your configuration file. The format of the directive is different depending upon whetheryou want to point to a label or file containing theprotection subdirectives or you want to include the protectionsubdirectives as part of the Protect directive. If you want to point to a label or file containing theprotection subdirectives, the format is as follows:  Protect request-template [setup-file/label[FOR Server-IP-address or hostname ]] If you want to include the protection subdirectives as partof the Protect directive, the format is as follows:    Protect request-template [Server-IP-address or hostname]   {     subdirective  value     subdirective  value     .     .     .   } request-template A template for requests that you want to activate protection for.The server compares incoming client requests to the template andactivates protection if there is a match. setup-file/label If you are pointing to a label or file containing theprotection subdirectives, use this parameter to identify theprotection setup you want to activate for requests that matchrequest-template. This parameter is optional.If it is omitted, the protection setup is defined by the most recentDefProt directive that contains a matching template. Protection setup is defined with protection subdirectives.See "Protection Subdirectives" for descriptionsof the protection subdirectives.If present, this parameter can take one of three forms: A full path and file name identifying a separate file thatcontains the protection subdirectives. A protection setup label name that matchesa name defined earlier on a Protection directive.The Protection directive contains the protection subdirectives. subdirective value If you want to include the protection subdirectives as partof the Protect directive, use this parameter.The left brace character must be the last characteron the same line as the Protect directive.Each subdirective follows on its own line.The right brace character must be on its own linefollowing the last subdirective line.You cannot put any comment lines between the braces. See "Protection Subdirectives" for descriptionsof the protection subdirectives. FOR Server-IP-address or hostname If you are using multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,use this parameter to specify an IP address ora host name.(For more information on using multiple IP addresses or virtualhosts, see "Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts".)The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the serveron this IP address or for this host.For an IP address, this is the address of theserver's network connection,not the address of the requesting client. You can specify an IP address (for example, FOR 204.146.167.72)or you can specify a host name (for example, FOR hostA.bcd.com). This parameter is optional.Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for allrequests regardless of the IP address the requests come in onor the host name in the URL. Notes: To use this parameter, you must also use thesetup-file/label parameter or thesubdirective value parameters. To use this parameter with a setup-file/label parameter,you must put FOR, or some other character string(without blanks), between the setup-file/labelparameter and the IP-addressor hostname parameter. To use this parameter with subdirective value parameters,do NOT include FOR before the IP-addressor hostname. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Examples:    Protection BUS-PROT {      AuthType Basic      ServerID restricted      PasswdFile d:\docs\WWW\restrict.pwd      GroupFile  d:\docs\WWW\restrict.grp      GetMask authors      PutMask authors   }   DefProt /secret/*        d:\server\protect\setup1.acc   Protect /secret/scoop/*   Protect /secret/business/*   BUS-PROT   Protect /topsecret/*  {      AuthType Basic      ServerID restricted      PasswdFile d:\docs\WWW\restrict.pwd      GroupFile  d:\docs\WWW\restrict.grp      GetMask topbrass      PutMask topbrass   }  Pass   /secret/scoop/*       d:\WWW\restricted\*  Pass   /secret/business/*    d:\WWW\confidential\*  Pass   /topsecret/*          d:\WWW\topsecret\* In the above example, the server activates protection as follows: Requests that start with /secret/scoop/ activate protection.The protection setup is defined inthe d:\server\protect\setup1.acc protection setup file.Since the Protect directive does not specify a protection setup,the protection setup on the previously matching DefProtdirective is used. Requests beginning with /secret/business/ activate protection.The protection setup is defined onthe Protection directive that has a label of BUS-PROT. Requests beginning with /topsecret/ activate protectionThe protection setup is included directly on the Protect directive.    Protect   /secret/*   CustomerA-PROT   FOR  9.67.106.79   Protect   /secret/*   CustomerB-PROT   FOR  9.83.100.45   Protect  /topsecret/*   9.67.106.79  {      AuthType Basic      ServerID restricted      PasswdFile /docs/WWW/customer-A.pwd      GroupFile  /docs/WWW/customer-A.grp      GetMask A-brass      PutMask A-brass   }   Protect  /topsecret/*   9.83.100.45   {      AuthType Basic      ServerID restricted      PasswdFile /docs/WWW/customer-B.pwd      GroupFile  /docs/WWW/customer-B.grp      GetMask B-brass      PutMask B-brass   } The above examples use IP addresses.If your server receives requests that beginwith /secret/ or /topsecret/, it activates a differentprotection setup for the request based on the IP addressof the network connection the request comes in on. For /secret/ requests coming in on 9.67.106.79,the server activates the protection setup defined on aProtection directive with a label of CustomerA-PROT.For /topsecret/ requests coming in on 9.67.106.79,the server activates the protection setup defined inlineon the Protect directive for /topsecret/. For /secret/ requests coming in on 9.83.100.45,the server activates the protection setup definedon a Protection directive with a label of CustomerB-PROT.For /topsecret/ requests coming in on 9.83.100.45,the server activates the protection setup definedinline on the Protect directive for /topsecret/.    Protect   /secret/*   CustomerA-PROT   FOR  hostA.bcd.com   Protect   /secret/*   CustomerB-PROT   FOR  hostB.bcd.com   Protect  /topsecret/*   hostA.bcd.com  {      AuthType Basic      ServerID restricted      PasswdFile /docs/WWW/customer-A.pwd      GroupFile  /docs/WWW/customer-A.grp      GetMask A-brass      PutMask A-brass   }   Protect  /topsecret/*   hostB.bcd.com {      AuthType Basic      ServerID restricted      PasswdFile /docs/WWW/customer-B.pwd      GroupFile  /docs/WWW/customer-B.grp      GetMask B-brass      PutMask B-brass   } The above examples use virtual hosts.If your server receives requests that beginwith /secret/ or /topsecret/, it activates a differentprotection setup for the request based on the host namein the URL. For /secret/ requests coming in for hostA.bcd.com,the server activates the protection setup defined on aProtection directive with a label of CustomerA-PROT.For /topsecret/ requests coming in for hostA.bcd.com,the server activates the protection setup defined inlineon the Protect directive for /topsecret/. For /secret/ requests coming in for hostB.bcd.com,the server activates the protection setup definedon a Protection directive with a label of CustomerB-PROT.For /topsecret/ requests coming in for hostB.bcd.com,the server activates the protection setup definedinline on the Protect directive for /topsecret/. Default Protection is provided for the Configuration and Administration formsby a Protect directive with a request template of /admin-bin/*. Protection - Define a named protection setup within the configuration file Use this directive to define a protection setupwithin the configuration file.You give the protection setup a name and define the typeof protection using protection subdirectives. Note: In the configuration file, you must place Protection directivesbefore any DefProt or Protect directives that point to them. The format of the directive is:    Protection label-name  {     subdirective  value     subdirective  value     .     .     .   } label-name The name you want to associate with this protection setup.The name can then be used by subsequent DefProt andProtect directives to point to this protection setup. subdirective value Put a protection subdirective and its value on each linebetween the left brace and the right brace.You cannot put any comment lines between the braces. See "Protection Subdirectives" for descriptionsof the protection subdirectives. Example    Protection  NAME-ME  {      AuthType Basic      ServerID restricted      PasswdFile d:\WWW\password.pwd      GroupFile  d:\WWW\group.grp      GetMask groupname      PutMask groupname   } Initial configuration file setting Protection  PROT-ADMIN  {    PasswdFile   C:\TCPIP\ETC\ADMIN.PWD    Mask         All@(*)    PostMask     All@(*)    PutMask      All@(*)    GetMask      All@(*)    AuthType     Basic    ServerID     Private_Authorization} Protection Subdirectives Following are descriptions of each of the protectionsubdirectives that can be used in a protection setup.The subdirectives are in alphabetical order. Protection setups can either be in separate files orwithin the configuration file as part ofDefProt, Protect, or Protection directives. See "Protection example (without SSL client authentication)" and the previous descriptionsof the DefProt, Protect, and Protection directivesfor examples of using protection setups. ACLOverride - Specify that ACL files override protection setups Use this subdirective with a value of Onif you want Access Control List files (ACL)to override the masks specified in the protection setup.If a directory being protected by the protection setup has an ACL file,the mask subdirectives in the protection setup are ignored.(The mask subdirectives areDeleteMask, GetMask, Mask, PostMask, and PutMask.) See "Using Access Control List (ACL) files" for more information on ACL files. Example    ACLOverride On AuthType - Specify authentication type Use this subdirective when limiting access basedon user names and passwords.Specify the type of authentication to usewhen the client sends a password to the server.With basic authentication (AuthType Basic),passwords are sent to the server as plain text.They are encoded, but not encrypted. Example    AuthType Basic DeleteMask - Specify the user names, groups, and addresses allowed to delete files Use this subdirective to specify user names, groups, and addressestemplates authorized to make DELETE requests to a protected directory.See "Rules for specifying user names, group names, and address templates". Example    DeleteMask authors,(niceguy,goodie)@96.96.3.1,128.141.*.* GetMask - Specify the user names, groups, and addresses allowed to get files Use this subdirective to specify user names, groups, and addresstemplates authorized to make GET requests to a protected directory.See "Rules for specifying user names, group names, and address templates". Example    GetMask authors,(niceguy,goodie)@96.96.3.1,128.141.*.* GroupFile - Specify the location of the associated group file Use this subdirective to specify the path and file nameof the server group file that you want this protection setup to use.The groups defined within the server group file can then be used by: Any mask subdirectives that are part of the protection setup.(The mask subdirectives are DeleteMask, GetMask, Mask,PostMask, and PutMask.) Any ACL file on a directory that is protected by the protection setup. See "Using server group files" more information about server group files. Example    GroupFile d:\docs\WWW\restrict.group Mask - Specify the user names, groups, and addresses allowed to make HTTP requests Use this subdirective to specify user names, groups,and address templates authorized to make HTTP requestsnot covered by other mask subdirectives.See "Rules for specifying user names, group names, and address templates".See "Methods - Set method acceptance" for descriptions of theHTTP methods supported by the server. Example    Mask authors,(niceguy,goodie)@96.96.3.1,128.141.*.* PasswdFile - Specify the location of the associated password file Use this subdirective when limiting access basedon user names and passwords.Specify the path and name of the password filethat you want this protection setup to use. Examples:    PasswdFile  c:\WWW\restrict.password PostMask - Specify the user names, groups, and addresses allowed to post files For a secure server, use this subdirective to specify users,groups, and address templates authorizedto make POST requests to a protected directory.See "Rules for specifying user names, group names, and address templates". Example    PostMask authors,(niceguy,goodie)@96.96.3.1,128.141.*.* PutMask - Specify the users names, groups, and addresses allowed to put files Use this subdirective to specify users, groups, and address templatesauthorized to make PUT requests to a protected directory.See "Rules for specifying user names, group names, and address templates". Example    PutMask authors,(niceguy,goodie)@96.96.3.1,128.141.*.* ServerID - Specify a name to associate with the password file Use this subdirective when limiting accessbased on user names and passwords.Specify a name you want to associate with the password file being used.The name does not need to be a real machine name. The name is used as an identifier to the requester.Since different protection setups can use differentpassword files, having a name associated with the protection setupcan help the client decide which password to send.Most clients display this name when promptingfor a user name and password. Example    ServerID restricted SSL client authentication subdirectives If you implement SSL client authentication, the server requeststhe client's certificate when the client makes an httpsrequest.The server establishes a secure connection whether or not theclient has a valid certificate. You can restrict who can access documents byusing password files and/or user or group authentication in protectionsetups as described in "Protecting your server".You can further restrict who can access documents by codingSSL client authentication parameters on protection setups,ACL files, or both.Coding SSL client authentication parameters on protectionsetups is described in "Creating protection setups for SSL client authentication";coding them in ACL files is described in "Step 5. Limiting access to individual files".For SSL client authentication parameters, youcan specify all or part of the Distinguished Name (DN) of a clientor of the certification authority (CA) who issued the client'scertificate.You can also specify DN information for multiple clients or CAs ona given parameter. When you use SSL client authentication parameters,the server first compares any DN information in a protection setup andthen compares any DN information in an ACL filewith the DN information in the client's certificate.If the DN information matches, the server serves the document. The following can be specifiedon the Protection or Protect directive: All or any of the following parameters that make up aclient's Distinguished Name in the client's certificate: CommonName - the client's common name Country - the country in which the client resides Locality - the locality in which the client resides StateOrProvince - the state or province in which the clientresides Organization - the organization of the client OrgUnit - the organizational unit of the client All or any of the following subdirectives that make up theCA's Distinguished Name in the client's certificate: IssuerCommonName - the CA's common name IssuerCountry - the country in which the CA resides IssuerLocality - the locality in which the CA resides IssuerStateOrProvince - the state or province in which the CAresides IssuerOrganization - the organization of the CA IssuerOrgUnit - the organizational unit of the CA Example Protect  /topsecret/*   {CommonName="Dr Sheila A. Jones"Organization="RTP Quick Care Center"} In the above example of an inline Protect directive, anyhttps request beginning with /topsecret/ causes theserver to request the client's certificate. If the client'scommon name is Dr Sheila A. Jones and the client's organizationis RTP Quick Care Center, then the server returns the documentto the client. Protect  /topsecret/*   {CommonName="Dr Sheila A. Jones","Dr Harry S. Smith"Organization="RTP Quick Care Center"} In the above example, anyhttps request beginning with /topsecret/ causes theserver to request the client's certificate. If the client'scommon name is either Dr Sheila A. Jones or Dr Harry S. Smithand the client's organizationis RTP Quick Care Center, then the server returns the documentto the client. Hints and tips for coding SSL client authentication parameters Specify any or all of a client or CA's DN Specify the DN information for multiple clients orCAs on a given parameter. The DN information should beseparated by a comma (as shown in the above example). Enclose DN information that contains blanks indouble quotes (as shown in the above example). Make sure the DN information matches the DN informationin the client's certificate. This information is case sensitiveand must have the same punctuation. Do not use wildcard characters for any of the parameters. Security - Set up network security for the server Security For a secure server, use the directives described in this sectionto control how your server uses network security functions. If you change these directives, you must stop your serverand then start it again for the changes to take effect.The server will not pick up the changes if you only restart it. KeyFile - Set name for key ring file Use this directive to set the name for the key ring file. If you change this directive, you must stop your server and thenstart it again for the change to take effect.The server will not pick up the change if you only restart it. Initial configuration file setting    KeyFile keyfile.kyr Program default setting    None NormalMode - Turn port on or off for HTTP Use this directive to turn on or off the portdefined by the Port directive. Set NormalMode on for an HTTP connection.If you also want an SSL connection, set SSLMode on. Note: You should have either this directive orthe SSLMode directive turned on.However, if both NormalMode and SSLMode are turned off,the server will start in normal mode,and you won't have a secure network connection. If you change this directive, you must stop your server andthen start it again for the change to take effect.The server will not pick up the change if you only restart it. Initial configuration file setting    NormalMode on Program default setting    NormalMode on SSLClientAuth - Enable SSL client authentication Use this directive to enable SSL client authentication. When this directive is enabled, the server requests a certificatefrom each client that makes an https request.Only enable client authentication if you need to authenticateclients; SSL client authentication increases network traffic. If you change this directive, you must stop your server and then startit again for the change to take effect. The server will not pick upthe change if you only restart it. Initial configuration file setting    SSLClientAuth off Program default setting    SSLClientAuth on SSLMode - Turn port on or off for SSL Use this directive to turn on or off the portdefined by the SSLPort directive. Set SSLMode on for an SSL connection.If you also want an HTTP connection, set NormalMode on. Note: You should have either this directiveor the NormalMode directive turned on.However, if both NormalMode and SSLMode are turned off,the server will start in normal mode,and you won't have a secure network connection. If you change this directive, you must stop your server and thenstart it again for the change to take effect.The server will not pick up the change if you only restart it. Initial configuration file setting    SSLMode on Program default setting    SSLMode off SSLPort - Set port for SSL security Use this directive to set the port for SSL security.The server will use this port only for HTTPS requests.(Requests for HTTP will still come on the port that youset with the Port directive.) If you want to use a port other than 443, specify a port above 1024. If you change this directive, you must stop your server and thenstart it again for the change to take effect.The server will not pick up the change if you only restart it. Initial configuration file setting    SSLPort 443 Program default setting    SSLPort 443 Multi-format processing - Define file extensions for multi-format processing Multi-format processing Use the directives described in this sectionto associate files with particular extensions to the meta-informationfound in the headers of incoming requests.Based on the file extension (suffixes) specified in these directives,the server binds files to a content type, content encoding,content language, character set,or to a browser sending a request. Multi-Format Processing Multi-format processing is only enabledwhen the requesting URL contains the .multi suffix ordoes not have a suffix (and a file with that name and no suffix doesnot exist). The resource mapping directives,AddType, AddEncoding, AddLanguage, AddCharSet, and AddClient,are used to associate meta-information from request headerswith file suffixes or extensions. Meta-information canconsist of MIME type, encoding,quality, charset, language, and browser (agent) type. The following table identifies meta-information that isassociated with each directive.

The requested URL The server finds all files with any extension that matches thedirectory and file name and usesmulti-format processing to choose the best file to return. Computing file quality Multi-format processing computes the quality of a file based on theset of suffixes in the directory for the requested file name and sendsthe highest quality it finds. A perfect match is alwaysthe highest quality. Quality is a floating point numberbetween 0.0 and 1.0 that represents the relative desirabilityof a file.For example, if the file abc.html is requested and cannot befound, the server searches the directory for all files thatmatch abc.*. Multi-format processing adds the * and findsall that may qualify. When computing file quality, each file is given the value of 1.0 andthis is multiplied by the quality of each suffix.The quality of a suffix is based on the quality value specifiedin the directive which is multiplied by the quality value specifiedin the accept-header. This can be shown as:   fileQ = (1.0 X ((suffixQ1) X (suffixQ2)...)) or   fileQ = (1.0 X ((directiveQ X headerQ) X (directiveQ X headerQ)...)) The quality value is optional on many of the directives. If one isnot specified, then the value of 1.0 is assumed. Also, if theaccept-header does not specify a quality value, 1.0 is assumed. If the server is processing a file and suffixthat is defined in the list of AddClient directives, and therequester agent matches the defined string, the server doublesthe file quality (implying a value of 2.0).If no match is found, this does not happen. Example If you have HTML source files in different languages,    myfile.du.html   myfile.uk.html you could use these directives for multi-format processing:    AddLanguage .du du   AddLanguage .uk en_UK   AddType .html text/html 8bit Then, if a browser sends a request for myfile.multi andsends the header Accept-Language: du, the server returnsmyfile.du.html.The server provides defaults for most commonly used extensions.Use the extension definition directives only if you needto add new definitions or change the default definitions. AddLanguage - Specify the language of files with particular extensions Use this directive to bind files with a particular extension to a language.The format of the directive is:    AddLanguage .extension  language .extension The file extension pattern. language The language you want to bind to filesthat match the corresponding extension pattern. Examples:    AddLanguage .en  en_US This example defines files with a .en extensionas being in American English.    AddLanguage .uk  en_UK This example defines files with a .uk extensionas being in United Kingdom English. Initial configuration file setting None. AddEncoding - Specify the MIME content encoding of files with particular extensions Use this directiveto bind files with a particular extension to a MIME-encoding type.This directive is seldom used. The format of the directive is:    AddEncoding .extension encoding .extension The file extension pattern. encoding The MIME-encoding type you want to bind to filesthat match the corresponding extension pattern. Example    AddEncoding .qp   quoted_printable Initial configuration file setting AddEncoding  .Z     x-compress    1.0AddEncoding  .gz    x-gzip        1.0 AddCharSet - Specify the character set documents are encoded in Use this directiveto specify the character set (code page) documents are stored in.(You can also specify character set on the AddType directive.) The format of the directive is:    AddCharSet .extension character-set .extension The file extension pattern. character-set The character setyou want to associate with text documents.For the documents that you assign a character set to,the server tells client browsers what character setto use when displaying the document.If you want to use the character-set field,you must also include a value for the quality field. Example    AddCharSet .932   IBM-932 Initial configuration file setting: None AddType - Specify the data type of files with particular extensions Use this directive to bind files with a particular extensionto a MIME type/subtype.You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein your configuration file.The server provides defaults for most commonly used extensions.The format of the directive is:    AddType .extension type/subtype encoding [quality[ character-set]] .extension The file extension pattern.You can use the wildcard character (*) only on the following twospecial extension patterns: *.* Matches all file names that contain a dot character (.)and have not been matched by other rules * Matches all file names that do not contain a dot character (.)and have not been matched by other rules type/subtype The MIME type and subtype you want to bind to filesthat match the corresponding extension pattern. encoding The MIME content encoding to which the data has been converted.In most cases, the appropriate encoding is 7bit, 8bit, or binary,and is determined as follows: 7bit Data is all represented as short (less than 1000characters) lines of 8859-1 ASCII data.Source code or plain text files usually fall into this category.Exceptions would be files containingline-drawing characters or accented characters. 8bit Data is represented as short lines,but may contain characters with the high bit set(for example, line-drawing characters or accented characters).PostScript files and text files from European sitesusually fall into this category. binary This encoding can be used for all data types.Data may contain not only non-ASCII characters, but also long(greater than 1000 characters) lines.Almost every file of type image/*, audio/*, and video/* fallsinto this category, as do binary data files of type application/*. Any other value of encoding receives the same treatmentas binary and is passed in MIME headersas a content encoding MIME header.7bit and 8bit is not sent in MIME headers. quality An optional indicator of relative value(on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0) for the content type.The quality value is used if multiplerepresentations of a file are matched by a request.The server selects the file that isassociated with the highest quality value.For example, if the file internet.ps is requested,and the server has the following AddType directives:    AddType   .ps application/postscript   8bit   1.0   AddType   *.* application/binary       binary 0.3 the server would use the application/postscript line because itsquality number is higher. character-set An optional indicator of the character setyou want to associate with text documents.For the documents that you assign a character set to,the server tells client browsers what character setto use when displaying the document.If you want to use the character-set field,you must also include a value for the quality field.

SuffixCaseSense - Specify whether extension definitions are case sensitive Use this directive to specify whether you want your serverto distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letterswhen comparing file extensions to the extension patterns onAddClient, AddCharSet,AddType, AddEncoding, and AddLanguage directives.By default, the server does not distinguishbetween uppercase and lowercase. Example    SuffixCaseSense  On Initial configuration file setting    SuffixCaseSense  Off AddClient - Specify file extensions for requesting clients Use this directive to bind files with particular extensions tothe type and version of client that is sending the request.This is often referred to as automatic browser detection. All HTTP requests contain a User-Agentheader that identifies the browser sending the request.The Internet Connection Secure Server enables you to detectwhich browser was used to send a request and, based on this information,respond with a version of a Web page, a document, or other filethat is appropriate for that browser. For example, your server can send a page written in HTML 3.0 onlyto browsers that are known to support it and send a versionof the same page written in HTML 2.0 to all other browsers. Automatic browser detectionis only effective for multi-format processing; that is whena requesting URL specifies a file without an extension and no filewith that name exists, or itspecifies a file with the extension .multi. For example,a link fromthis HTML anchor tag initiates multi-format processing:     <A HREF="http://www.raleigh.ibm.com/cjjd/tscores.multi> As a result,the server will evaluate the values passed in the request headers(such as User-Agent), alongwith the extensions of all the tscores files and the associationsspecified in the directives.Based on this, it will try to find the file that is the'best match' to send in its response. You canhave multiple occurrences of this directive in your configurationfile. The sequence of AddClient directives is important.The first AddClientdirective that matches a client's User-Agent valueis the one that will be used to determine the file extension. If a client's User-Agent is not matched in an AddClient directive,the server looks for a generic file extension (.htm or .html) to send.If the server cannot find a generic file extension, it uses analgorithm to calculatethe quality of all the extensions for that fileand sends the file whose extension yields the highest quality,considering it to be the 'best match'. The format of the directive is:    AddClient  .extension  user-agent .extension The file extension of the file you want to send to a particularbrowser. You cannot use any wildcard characters in this pattern.This extension can be one of a string of suffixes used to qualify a file.For example, the extension .Mozilla can apply to a file namedTxtSample.UK.Mozilla.html or TxtSample.html.Mozilla.eng. user-agent The value to match in the User-Agent header of the incoming request. This field is case-sensitive.You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard character in this field.For example, IBM* applies to all versions of IBM's browser, WebExplorer. Examples     AddClient  .Mozilla       Mozilla/2.*    AddClient  .OldMozilla    Mozilla/1.*    AddClient  .Webex         IBM* Program default setting If a client's User-Agent is not matched in an AddClient directive,the server looks for a generic file extension (.htm or .html) to send.If the server cannot find a generic file extension, it uses analgorithm to calculatethe quality of all the extensions for that fileand sends the file whose extension yields the highest quality,considering it to be the 'best match'. Initial configuration file setting None Using automatic browser detection for Welcome pages Using automaticbrowser detection for sending various welcome pages requiresadditional considerations. Follow these steps to enable browserdetection and multi-format processing for your welcome pages. Asan example, they showhow to serve different versions of the index.htmlfile (in a fictitious webhome directory)but this also works for Welcome.html,welcome.html, or Frontpage.html files. Add a Welcome directive to your configuration file(httpd.cnf or httpd.conf) that specifies the file namewith the .multi extension.     Welcome  index.multi Include AddClient directives in the configuration file thatspecify which file extensions to send to a particular browser.     AddClient  .Mozilla       Mozilla/2.*    AddClient  .OldMozilla    Mozilla/1.*    AddClient  .Webex         IBM* Create specific versions of the index file for each of thesefile extensions: index.Mozilla.html, index.OldMozilla.html,index.WebEx.html. Create a dummy file in the directory calledindex.multi. Specify only the directory name in the URL when linking to this page.    http://www.web4hire.com/webhome/ Resource mapping - Redirect URLs Resource mapping Use the directives described in this section to controlwhich requests your server acceptsand where the server looks for resources. Use the mapping directives (Exec, Fail, Map, Pass, and Redirect)to control which requests your server accepts and tomap URL requests to your actual files. You can use the mapping directivesto create a virtual hierarchy of Web resources.You can then change the physical location of files ordirectories without affecting the virtual layout.Even if your server sends documents from different filesystems, it can present a virtual layout. The server applies the mapping directives in the order they appearin the configuration file until a request has been accepted, rejected,or there are no more directives that apply to the request. Exec - Run a CGI program for matching requests Use this directive to specify a template for requests you wantto accept and respond to by running a CGI program.Once a request matches a template on an Exec directive, the requestis not compared to request templates on any subsequent directives. The format of the directive is:  Exec  request-template program-path [Server-IP-address or hostname] request-template A template for requests that you want your serverto accept and respond to by running a CGI program. You must use an asterisk as a wildcard in both therequest-template and program-path.The part of the request that matchesthe request-template wildcard must begin with the nameof the file that contains the CGI program. The request can also contain additional data that is passedto the CGI program in the PATH_INFO environment variable.The additional data follows the first slash character that comesafter the CGI program file name on the request.The data is passed according to CGI specifications. program-path The path to the file that contains the CGI programyou want the server to execute for the request.program-path must also contain a wildcard.The wildcard is replaced with the name of the filethat contains the CGI program. Important migration note:The Exec directive is now recursive and applies to allsubdirectories. You no longer need a separate Exec directive foreach directory under cgi-bin and admin-bin. Server-IP-address or hostname If you are using multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,use this parameter to specify an IP address ora host name.(For more information on using multiple IP addresses or virtualhosts, see "Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts".)The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the serveron this IP address or for this host.For an IP address, this is the address of theserver's network connection,not the address of the requesting client. You can specify an IP address (for example, 204.146.167.72)or you can specify a host name (for example, hostA.bcd.com). This parameter is optional.Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for allrequests regardless of the IP address the requests come in onor the host name in the URL. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Examples:    Exec  /idd/depts/*  d:\depts\bin\* In the above example, if your server receives a requestof /idd/depts/plan/c92, it runs the CGI programin d:\depts\bin\plan.exe or d:\depts\bin\plan.cmdwith c92 passed to the program as input.    Exec    /cgi-bin/*    C:\CGI-BIN\customerA\*   204.146.167.72   Exec    /cgi-bin/*    C:\CGI-BIN\customerB\*   9.83.100.45 The above example uses the optional IP address parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /cgi-bin/,it serves the request from a different directory based onthe IP address of the network connection the request comes in on.For requests coming in on 9.67.106.79, the server uses theC:\CGI-BIN\customerA directory.For requests coming in on any connection with an address of9.83.100.45,the server uses the C:\CGI-BIN\customerB directory.    Exec    /cgi-bin/*    C:\CGI-BIN\customerA\*   hostA.bcd.com   Exec    /cgi-bin/*    C:\CGI-BIN\customerB\*   hostB.bcd.com The above example uses the optional host name parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /cgi-bin/,it serves the request from a different directory based onthe host name in the URL.For requests coming in for hostA.bcd.com, the server uses theC:\CGI-BIN\customerA directory.For requests coming in on any connection forhostB.bcd.com,the server uses the C:\CGI-BIN\customerB directory. Initial configuration file setting    Exec    /admin-bin/*  d:\path\*   Exec    /cgi-bin/*    d:\path\* d:\path\ is replaced by a directory youentered at installation.If you used the installation defaults, your default Execdirectives would be:    Exec    /admin-bin/*  C:\WWW\ADMIN\*   Exec    /cgi-bin/*    C:\WWW\CGI-BIN\* Fail - Reject matching requests Use this directive to specify a template for requests youdo not want to process.Once a request matches a template on a Fail directive, the requestis not compared to request templates on any subsequent directives. The format of the directive is:  Fail  request-template [Server-IP-address or hostname] request-template A template for requests that you want your server to reject.If a request matches the template, the server sends the requesteran error message. You can use an asterisk as a wildcard in the template.The tilde character just after a slash (/~)has to be explicitly matched; a wildcard cannot be used to match it. Server-IP-address or hostname If you are using multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,use this parameter to specify an IP address ora host name.(For more information on using multiple IP addresses or virtualhosts, see "Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts".)The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the serveron this IP address or for this host.For an IP address, this is the address of theserver's network connection,not the address of the requesting client. You can specify an IP address (for example, 204.146.167.72)or you can specify a host name (for example, hostA.bcd.com). This parameter is optional.Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for allrequests regardless of the IP address the requests come in onor the host name in the URL. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Examples:    Fail /usr/local/private/* In the above example, the server rejects anyrequests beginning with /usr/local/private/.    Fail    /customerB/*    204.146.167.72   Fail    /customerA/*    9.83.100.45 The above example uses the optional IP address parameter.The server rejects any requests beginning with /customerB/ if therequest comes in on a network connection with IP address 204.146.167.72The server rejects any requests beginning with /customerA/ if therequest comes in on a network connection with anIP address of 9.83.100.45.    Fail    /customerB/*    hostA.bcd.com   Fail    /customerA/*    hostB.bcd.com The above example uses the optional host name parameter.The server rejects any requests beginning with /customerB/ if therequest comes in for hostA.The server rejects any requests beginning with /customerA/ if therequest comes in for hostB. Initial configuration file setting None. Map - Change matching requests to a new result string Use this directive to specify a template for requestsyou want to change to a new request string.After your server changes the request, it takes the new request stringand compares it to the request templates on subsequent directives. The format of the directive is:  Map   request-template new-request [Server-IP-address or hostname] request-template A template for requests that you want your server to change andthen continue comparing the new request string to other templates. You can use an asterisk as a wildcard in the template.The tilde character just after a slash (/~)has to be explicitly matched; a wildcard cannot be used to match it. new-request The new request string you want your server to continueto compare to the request templates on subsequent directives.new-request may contain a wildcardif the request-template has one.The part of the request that matches therequest-template wildcard is inserted in placeof the wildcard in new-request. Server-IP-address or hostname If you are using multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,use this parameter to specify an IP address ora host name.(For more information on using multiple IP addresses or virtualhosts, see "Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts".)The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the serveron this IP address or for this host.For an IP address, this is the address of theserver's network connection,not the address of the requesting client. You can specify an IP address (for example, 204.146.167.72)or you can specify a host name (for example, hostA.raleigh.ibm.com). This parameter is optional.Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for allrequests regardless of the IP address the requests come in onor the host name in the URL. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Examples:    Map   /stuff/*   /good/stuff/* In the above example, your server would take any requestsstarting with /stuff/ and change the /stuff/ portionof the request to /good/stuff/.Anything that followed /stuff/ on the originalrequest would also be included in the new request string.So /stuff/whatsup/ would change to /good/stuff/whatsup/.Your server would take the new request stringand continue to compare it to requesttemplates on subsequent directives.    Map   /stuff/*   /customerA/good/stuff/*   204.146.167.72   Map   /stuff/*   /customerB/good/stuff/*   9.83.104.45 The above examples use the optional IP address parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /stuff/,it changes the request to a different request string based onthe IP address of the network connection the request comes in on.For requests coming in on 204.146.167.72the server changes the /stuff/portion of the request to /customerA/good/stuff/.For requests coming in on any connection with an address of9.83.100.45, the server changes the /stuff/ portionof the request to /customerB/good/stuff/.    Map   /stuff/*   /customerA/good/stuff/*   hostA.bcd.com   Map   /stuff/*   /customerB/good/stuff/*   hostB.bcd.com The above examples use the optional host name parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /stuff/,it changes the request to a different request string based onthe host name in the URL.For requests coming in for hostA,the server changes the /stuff/portion of the request to /customerA/good/stuff/.For requests coming in for hostB,the server changes the /stuff/ portionof the request to /customerB/good/stuff/. Initial configuration file setting None. Pass - Accept matching requests Use this directive to specify a template for requests you wantto accept and respond to with a document from your server.Once a request matches a template on a Pass directive, the requestis not compared to request templates on any subsequent directives. The format of the directive is:  Pass  request-template [file-path [Server-IP-address or hostname]] request-template A template for requests that you want your server to accept andrespond to with a document from your server. You can use an asterisk as a wildcard in the template.The tilde character just after a slash (/~)has to be explicitly matched; a wildcard cannot be used to match it. file-path The path to the file that contains the document you want theserver to return.file-path may contain a wildcardif the request-template has one.The part of the request that matches the request-templatewildcard is inserted in place of the wildcard in file-path. This parameter is optional.If you do not specify a path, the request itself is used as the path.The drive is assumed to be the drivewhere the server program is installed. Server-IP-address or hostname If you are using multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,use this parameter to specify an IP address ora host name.(For more information on using multiple IP addresses or virtualhosts, see "Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts".)The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the serveron this IP address or for this host.For an IP address, this is the address of theserver's network connection,not the address of the requesting client. You can specify an IP address (for example, 204.146.167.72)or you can specify a host name (for example, hostA.raleigh.ibm.com). This parameter is optional.Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for allrequests regardless of the IP address the requests come in onor the host name in the URL. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Examples:    Pass   /updates/parts/*   C:\WWW\HTML\catalog\updates\parts\* In the above example, your server would respond to a requeststarting /updates/parts/ with a document fromC:\WWW\HTML\catalog\updates\parts\.Anything that followed /updates/parts/ would also be usedto identify the document.So your server would respond tothe request /updates/parts/printers/ribbon.html with the documentin file C:\WWW\HTML\catalog\updates\parts\printers\ribbon.html.    Pass   /gooddoc/* In the above example, your server would respondto a request starting with /gooddoc/ with a document fromd:\gooddoc\ (where d: isthe drive where you installed the server program).So your server would respond to the request/gooddoc/volume1/issue2/newsletter4.html with the document in filed:\gooddoc\volume1\issue2\newsletter4.html.    Pass   /parts/*   C:\customerA\catalog\*   204.146.167.72   Pass   /parts/*   C:\customerB\catalog\*   9.83.104.45 The above examples use the optional IP address parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /parts/,it returns a file from a different directory based onthe IP address of the network connection the request comes in on.For requests coming in on 204.146.167.72the server returns a file from C:\customerA\catalog\.For requests coming in on any connection with an addressof 9.83.104.45,the server returns a file from C:\customerB\catalog\.    Pass   /parts/*   C:\customerA\catalog\*   hostA.bcd.com   Pass   /parts/*   C:\customerB\catalog\*   hostB.bcd.com The above examples use the optional host name parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /parts/,it returns a file from a different directory based onthe IP address of the network connection the request comes in on.For requests coming in for hostA.bcd.com,the server returns a file from C:\customerA\catalog\.For requests coming in for hostB.bcd.com,the server returns a file from C:\customerB\catalog\. Initial configuration file setting    Pass  /reports/*               d:\path\*   Pass  /Docs/*                  d:\path\*   Pass  /httpd-internal-icons/*  d:\path\*   Pass  /icons/*                 d:\path\*   Pass  /Admin/*.html            d:\path\*   Pass  /Admin/*.gif             d:\path\*   Pass  /*                       d:\path\* d:\path\ is replaced by a directoryyou entered at installation.If you used the installation defaults, these Pass directives would be:    Pass    /Docs/*                  C:\WWW\DOCS\*   Pass    /httpd-internal-icons/*  C:\WWW\ICONS\*   Pass    /icons/*                 C:\WWW\ICONS\*   Pass    /Admin/*                 C:\WWW\ADMIN\*   Pass    /*                       C:\WWW\HTML\* Note: The path following Pass /*is your document root directory.See "Understanding the document root directory" for more information. Redirect - Send matching requests to another server Use this directive to specify a template for requestsyou want to accept and send to another server.Once a request matches a template on a Redirect directive,the request is not compared to templates on any other directivesin your configuration file. The format of the directive is:  Redirect request-template URL  [Server-IP-address or hostname] request-template A template for requests that you want your serverto send to another server. You can use an asterisk as a wildcard in the template.The tilde character just after a slash (/~)has to be explicitly matched; a wildcard cannot be used to match it. URL The URL request you want your server to send to another server.The response to this request goes to the originalrequester without any indication that it did not come from your server. URL must contain a protocol specificationand the name of the server to send the request to.It can also contain a path or file name.If request-template uses a wildcard, thepath or file name on URL can also use a wildcard.The part of the original request that matches thewildcard on request-templateis inserted in place of the wildcard on URL. Server-IP-address or hostname If you are using multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,use this parameter to specify an IP address ora host name.(For more information on using multiple IP addresses or virtualhosts, see "Running your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts".)The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the serveron this IP address or for this host.For an IP address, this is the address of theserver's network connection,not the address of the requesting client. You can specify an IP address (for example, 204.146.167.72)or you can specify a host name (for example, hostA.bcd.com). This parameter is optional.Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for allrequests regardless of the IP address the requests come in onor the host name in the URL. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Example    Redirect  /chief/stuff/*   http://www.other.org/wahoo/* In this example, your server sends any requests beginning with/chief/stuff/ to the wahoo directory of the www.other.org server.    Redirect  /stuff/*   http://www.chief.org/wahoo/*   204.146.167.72   Redirect  /stuff/*   http://www.dawg.com/pound/*    9.83.100.45 The above examples use the optional IP address parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /stuff/,it redirects the request to different servers based onthe IP address of the network connection the request comes in on.For requests coming in on 204.146.167.72, the server sends the requestto the wahoo directory of the www.chief.org server.For requests coming in on any connection with an addressof 9.83.100.45, the server sends the request to the pound directoryof the www.dawg.com server.    Redirect  /stuff/*   http://www.chief.org/wahoo/*   hostA.bcd.com   Redirect  /stuff/*   http://www.dawg.com/pound/*    hostB.bcd.com The above examples use the optional IP address parameter.If your server receives requests that begin with /stuff/,it redirects the request to different servers based onthe host name in the URL.For requests coming in for hostA, the server sends the requestto the wahoo directory of the www.chief.org server.For requests coming in for hostB,the server sends the request to the pound directoryof the www.dawg.com server. Initial configuration file setting None. InheritEnv - Specify which environment variables are inherited by CGI programs Use this directive to specify which environment variablesyou want your CGI programs to inherit (other than the CGIenvironment variables that are specific to CGI processing). If you do not include an InheritEnv directive,all environment variables are inherited by CGI programs.If you include any InheritEnv directive, only those environmentvariables specified on InheritEnv directives will be inheritedalong with the CGI-specific environment variables.The directive allows you to optionally initializethe value of the variables that are inherited. Refer to the Web Programming Guide for a listof the CGI-specific environment variables. Example    InheritEnv PATH   InheritEnv LANG=ENUS In this example, only the PATH and LANG environment variables will be inherited by CGI programs. Initial configuration file setting None.The default is all environment variables are inherited by CGI programs. DisInheritEnv - Specify which environment variables are disinherited by CGI programs Use this directive to specify which environment variablesyou do not want your CGI programs to inherit (other than the CGIenvironment variables that are specific to CGI processing). By default,all environment variables are inherited by CGI programs.You can exclude individual environment variables frombeing inherited with the DisInheritEnv directive. Refer to the Web Programming Guide for a listof the CGI-specific environment variables. Example    DisInheritEnv PATH   DisInheritEnv LANG In this example, all environment variables exceptPATH and LANG will be inherited by CGI programs. Initial configuration file setting None.The default is all environment variables are inherited by CGI programs. Error message customization - Customize error messages the server returns to clients Error message customization Use this directive to customize the messages your server sends tothe requesting client when it encounters an error condition.For example, you can change a message to include more informationabout the cause of the problem and suggest possible solutions to fix it.For internal networks, you might providea contact person for your users to call. Each error condition is identified by a key word.To decide which error messages you want to customize,first review the list of error conditions, their causes,and the default message that the server sends.Then, for each error message you want to change: Create an individual HTML file with the desired text. Add an ErrorPage directive to your configuration filethat associates the error condition key wordwith the HTML file you want to serve. Note: The server does not parse your error files for imbeds, regardlessof the file extensions or use of the Imbeds directive. ErrorPage - Specify a customized message for a particular error condition Use this directive to specify the name of a file that you wantto send when the server encounters a particular error condition. You can place this directiveanywhere in the configuration file.When the error occurs, the file will be processed according tothe mapping rules defined in your configuration file.Therefore, the file you want to send must be in a locationthat can be reached through the mapping rules as definedby the Fail, Map, NameTrans, Pass, Redirect, Service directives.At a minimum, you need a Pass directive that would allowthe server to pass the error message file. The format of this directive is:    ErrorPage keyword /path/filename.htm keyword One of the key words associated with an error condition.See "Error Conditions, Causes, and Default Messages" for a list of keywords. /path/filename.htm This is the fully qualified Web name of your error file,as viewed by a client on the Web.The file must be an HTML file. Example    ErrorPage scriptstart /errors/html/scriptstart.htm In the above example, when a scriptstart condition isencountered, the server will send thescriptstart.htm file to the client. This file might contain the following HTML text: <HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Message for SCRIPTSTART condition</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>The CGI program could not be started.<P><A HREF="mailto:admin@websvr.com">Notify the administrator</A>of this problem.</BODY></HTML> If the server's configuration file containsPASS /* d:\wwwhome\*,then the full path for this message file would bed:\wwwhome\errors\html\scriptstart.htm. Default: If you do not specify an ErrorPage directivefor an error condition, the server's default error messagefor that condition will be sent. Error Conditions, Causes, and Default Messages The following list shows the HTTP response code andkey word for each error condition, followed by theprobable cause, and the default message the server sends. Code and Key Word Cause and Default Message 302 okredirect Cause:The requested file is on another recognized server.The name of the server is sent backto the requesting client along with a message.The client can connect to the correct serveror display the message that is sent. Default message:Found. 400 badrequest Cause:Either there is a network problem, such as a time-out,or the request was indecipherable. Default message:Invalid request - completely unable to parse it. 400 badscript Cause:The server could determine that the requested filewas a CGI script but it could not process it;the request was invalid in some way. Default message:The script execution request is not valid. 400 connectfailed Cause:On a tunneled request,the server could not connect to the requested partner on the requestedport. Default message:Host not found or not responding. 400 nopartner Cause:On a tunneled request,the server could not connect to the requested hostname due to badsyntax or an unknown host. Default message:Host not found or not responding. 400 proxyfail Cause:The client is trying to use the server as a proxy,and although this is allowed, it did not work.Possibly the destination server doesn't exist or is busy. Default message:Proxy load failed. 400 unknownmethod Cause:The request did not include a recognized method,such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. Default message:The request is not valid or not recognized. 401 notauthorized Cause:The request requires a user ID and password.Either the user ID and password sent by the client are not validfor this request or the client did not send a user ID and password. Default message:Not Authorized. Authentication failed. 401 notmember Cause:The requested file has a protection rule listingvalid user IDs and passwords and the user IDof the requesting client is not included in that list. Default message:Not authorized to access the document. 403 baduser Cause:The client requested a user's home directory that does not exist. Default message:The user directory is not valid. 403 badredirect Cause:The server is trying to redirect the request and the Redirectdirective is invalid (possibly missing a destination) or contains a loop. Default message:The redirection in the configuration file is not valid. 403 byrule Cause:Either the file requested is specifically blockedby a Fail directive or it does not match any of the files thatare allowed to be accessed according to other request mapping directives. Default message:Forbidden by rule. 403 dirbrowse Cause:The client specified a directory (rather than a file name) in the URLthat does not have a welcome page and the administrator has turned offdirectory browsing (either for this directory or for the entire server). Default message:Directory browsing failed - access forbidden. 403 dotdot Cause:The client request contains an instruction (/../) tonavigate above the document directory root and this is not allowed. Default message:Forbidden - URL containing .. forbidden (don't try to break in). 403 ipmask Cause:The file requested has a protection rule that includes a list ofvalid IP addresses and the client's address is not included in the list. Default message:Server will not serve to your IP address. 403 ipmaskproxy Cause:The client is trying to use the server as a proxy and the clientis not included in the list of host names or IP addresses that areallowed to do so. Default message:Proxy server will not serve to your IP address(at least with this HTTP method). 403 methoddisabled Cause:The client requested a method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that isspecifically not allowed by the Disable directive. Default message:Method method is disabled on this server. 403 noacl Cause:The directory has a protection rule but does not havean Access Control List (ACL) defined and the protection setupdoes not have a GetMask subdirective.The administrator needs to remove the protection rule or add an ACL. Default message:Access to this file is not allowed 'no ACL file'. 403 noentry Cause:The directory is protected by an Access Control List(ACL) and the user is not included in the ACL. Default message:Access to this file is not allowed (no ACL entry). 403 notallowed Cause:The requested file was found but the server'sprotection setup prevented access.This is commonly generated for URLs that point to CGI programs. Default message:The PUT and DELETE methods must be specifiedin the server's protection setup. 403 openfailed Cause:After passing the protection rules, the server determined thatthe client should have read access to the filebut the operating system will not allow the server to access it.Possibly the user ID running the server does not haveread permission to the file it is trying to serve orthe file system may be encountering problems. Default message:Can't browse selected file. 403 setuperror Cause:The directory has an Access Control List (ACL) definedbut does not have a protection rule.The administrator needs to add a protection rule or remove the ACL. Default message:Server protection setup error occurred.Probably, the protection setup file was not found or itcontained a syntax error. 404 multifail Cause:The requested file could not be found on the server.The server tried to match the file name exactly as specified andwith every known file extension appended. Default message:The file was not found, even after searching on any extensionsto the file name. 407 proxynotauth Cause:The proxy request requires a user ID and password.Either the user ID and password sent by the client are not validfor this request or the client did not send a user ID and password.Note that some Web browsers do not supportthe PROXY-AUTHENTICATE function. Default message:Not authorized.Proxy-Authentication failed (or your browser does not support it). 407 proxynotmember Cause:The proxy request has a protection rule listing valid user IDsand the user ID of the requesting client is not included in that list. Default message:Not authorized for proxy access to the document. 412 preconfail Cause:A precondition specified by the client on this request was not met.For example, this could result from an HTTP/1.1 request with acondition "if-not-modified-since xxx". Default message:Precondition failed: could not match entity tags. 500 scriptio Cause:The client requested a CGI script; the server can find it and startit but cannot get it to process input or output.The script may contain invalid code. Default message:Cannot read script output pipe. 500 scriptnotfound Cause:The client requested a CGI script that cannot be found. Default message:The script request is not valid; none of <program>and <program>.pp is executable. 500 scriptstart Cause:The client requested a CGI script; the server can find itbut cannot start it.The script may contain invalid code. Default message:Starting the CGI program failed.Could not communicate with the CGI program. 501 noformat Cause:The server has encountered an internal error andcannot interpret the format of the file it is trying to serve.The file may be corrupted or have an unknown or invalid file extension. Default message:Sorry, can't convert from mime-type-1to mime-type-2. Timeouts - Close connections automatically Timeouts Use the directives described in this section tocontrol the amount of time the server spends processing requests.If you are using persistent connections, see "PersistTimeout - Specify time to wait for the client to send another request". InputTimeout - Specify input timeout setting Use this directive to set the time allowed for a clientto send a request after making a connection to the server.A client first connects to the server and then sends a request.If the client does not send a request within the amount of timeon this directive, the server drops the connection.Specify the time value in any combination of hours,minutes (or mins), and seconds (or secs). Example    InputTimeout 3 mins 30 secs Initial configuration file setting    InputTimeout 5 minutes 30 seconds OutputTimeout - Specify output timeout setting Use this directive to set the maximum time allowed foryour server to send output to a client.The time limit applies to requests for local files and requests forwhich the server is acting as a proxy.The time limit does not apply for requests thatstart a local CGI program. If the server does not send the complete response within the amountof time on this directive, the server drops the connection.Specify the time value in any combination of hours,minutes (or mins), and seconds (or secs). Example    OutputTimeout 20 minutes Initial configuration file setting    OutputTimeout 1 hour ScriptTimeout - Specify script timeout setting Use this directive to set the time allowed for a programstarted by the server to finish.The server stops a program if it runs longer than the limit.Specify the time value in any combination of hours,minutes (or mins), and seconds (or secs). Example    ScriptTimeout 15 mins Initial configuration file setting    ScriptTimeout 10 minutes Methods - Set method acceptance Methods Use the directives described in this section tocontrol which HTTP methods are enabled for your server. Client requests to the server include a method field that indicatesthe action the server is to perform on the specified object.The request identifies the object with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Following is a list of methods that the server supportsand a description of how the server would respondto a client request containing the method.The description assumes the method is enabled. CONNECT- This method is used to establish an SSL tunneling sessionbetween a client, such as NetScape Navigator,and a remote server through a proxy server.The sessions between the client and the proxy and between the proxyand the remote server are secure. The proxy does not have access tothe data being sent.The proxy server can be a base or secure server. DELETE - The serverdeletes the object identified by the URL.After the object is deleted, the URL is not valid.Because delete typically lets clients delete informationfrom your server, you must use protection setups to definewho can use this method and which files can be deleted(see "Protecting your server"). GET - The server returns whatever data is identified by the URL.If the URL refers to an executable program,the server returns the output of the program. HEAD - The server returns only HTTP document headerswithout the document body. OPTIONS - The request returns information about the communicationsoptions on the request/response chain identified by the URL.This method allows a client to determine the options and requirementsassociated with an object, or the capabilities of a server, withouthaving to act on or retrieve the object. POST - The request contains data and a URL.The server accepts the data enclosed in the request as a newsubordinate of the resource identified in the URL.The resource, which may be a data-accepting program, a gatewayto some other protocol, or a separate program that acceptsannotations, processes the enclosed data. The POST method isdesigned to handle annotation of existing resources; postingof a message to a bulleting boards, newsgroup, mailing list,or similar group of articles; providing a block of data, suchas data from a form to a data-handling program; or extendinga database through an append operation.In the Internet Connection Secure Server, the POST method is used to process the Configurationand Administration forms. PUT - The request contains data and a URL.The server stores the resource identified in the URL.If the resource already exists, PUT replaces it. If the resourcedoes not exist, PUT creates it.Because PUT typically lets clients add or replaceinformation on your server, you must use protection setups to definewho can use this method for which files (see "Protecting your server"). TRACE - The server echos the request message sent by the client.This method allows the client to seewhat is being received at the other end of the request chain and usethat data for testing or diagnostic information.The content type of the response is message/http. Disable - Disable HTTP methods Use this directive to specify which HTTP methods you do notwant your server to accept. In the default configuration file, the GET, HEAD, OPTIONS,POST, and TRACEmethods are enabled and all other supported HTTP methods are disabled.To disable a method that is currently enabled,change the Enable directive for the method to a Disable directive. Note: The Configuration and Administration forms use thePOST method to make updates to your server configuration.If you disable the POST method you will not be ableto use the Configuration and Administration forms. Example    Disable HEAD Initial configuration file setting    Disable   PUT   Disable   DELETE Enable - Enable HTTP methods Use this directive to specify which HTTP methodsyou want your server to accept. You can enable as many of the HTTP methods as you need.For each method you want the server to accept, enter a separateEnable directive followed by the name of the method. Example    Enable DELETE If no Service directive exists for a particular URL, you canuse the Enable directive to perform customized programming for anyHTTP method. The program you specify on this directivewill override the standard processing for that method. The format is:    Enable     method d:\path\fileDLL:function_name Example    Enable Initial configuration file setting    Enable GET   Enable HEAD   Enable POST   Enable TRACE   Enable OPTIONS Important migration notes Beginning with Version 4.2, theCHECKIN and CHECKOUT methods are no longer supported.You can use the PUT method for CHECKIN and the GET method forCHECKOUT; however, theInternet Connection Secure Server does not perform locking or versioning. The accessory script directives, DELETE-Script, POST-Script,PUT-Script, and Search, are no longer supported. You need toport your scripts to ICAPI applications. See the WebProgramming Guide for more information. Meta-Information - Name meta-information files and directories Meta-Information Use the directives described in this section tocontrol where your server looks for meta-information files. You can use a separate set of files to store meta-informationabout your server's documents.The server can include the meta-information with its HTTP responses.Meta-information describes the file containing adocument, not the contents of the document.For example, meta-information for a file might give the datethe file was created and the date it was last modified.You can include any valid response headers as described in theHTTP 1.1 specification. HTTP recognizes MIME headers.Information that MIME header fields can include arethe file type, subtype, encoding, and content length. Each line of a meta-information file contains a header field,followed by a colon, and the value of the field.For example:    Last-Modified: Wednesday, 05-Apr-96 20:51:35 GMT   Expires: Friday, 30-Jun-96 24:00:00 GMT   MIME-Version: 1.0 MetaDir - Specify name of subdirectory for meta-information files Use this directive to specify the name you want to use forsubdirectories that contain meta-information files.You can only have one instance of this directive, which means allyour meta-information subdirectories have the same name. Any directory from which your server retrieves files can havea subdirectory with the name specified on this directive.The files on the meta-information subdirectory contain meta-informationabout the files being retrieved.The meta-information files have the same file nameand extension as the file they describe, plus an added extension.The name of the added extension is specified on the MetaSuffix directive. For example, you might have the following two directivesin your configuration file:    MetaDir     look_here   MetaSuffix  .file_desc If your server goes to retrieve this file:    d:/html/realcool/coolindex.html it looks for meta information to include with the response in this file:    d:/html/realcool/look_here/coolindex.html.file_desc Example    MetaDir  mimeinfo Initial configuration file setting    MetaDir  .web Note: The dot character (.) at the beginning of thedefault value is used as part of the subdirectory name. MetaSuffix - Specify the extension for meta-information files Use this directive to specify the extension you wantto use for meta-information files.You can only have one instance of this directive, which means allmeta-information files end with the same extension.You must include the period character (.)as part of the value. Any file your server retrieves can havea meta-information file associated with it.A meta-information file has the same file name and extensionas the file it describes, plus the additionalextension specified on the MetaSuffix directive.A meta-information file must be located on a subdirectoryof the directory that contains the file being described.The name of the subdirectory must be the namespecified on the MetaDir directive. See the description of the MetaDir directive to see anexample of how MetaDir and MetaSuffix work together. Example    MetaSuffix   .head Initial configuration file setting    MetaSuffix   .meta ICAPI application processing - Specify ICAPI applications for request processing ICAPI application processing The Internet Connection Application Programming Interface(ICAPI) allows you to extend the Internet Connection Secure Server's base functions with yourown customized processing routines.Use the directives described in this sectionto have the server call the application functions in yourprogram at various points in its request processing cycle.You can find detailed information for writingthe application functions and compilingyour program in the Web Programming Guide. Except for Service and NameTrans, these directivescan be in any order in the configuration fileand you do not need to include every directive.If you do not have a customized application functionfor a particular step, just omit the corresponding directive.The normal processing for that step will execute by default. The Service and NameTrans directives behavelike the other mapping directives and are sensitiveto their placement in the configuration file.For example a rule for /cgi-bin/foo.dll must appearbefore the rule for /cgi-bin/*. You can also have more than one configuration directive for a step.For example, you could include two NameTrans directives,each pointing to a different application function.When the server performs the name translation step,it will process your name translation functions inthe order in which they appear within the configuration file. Your application functions do not haveto be executed for every request: By specifying a URL with some directives, you can indicatethat you want the application function called only for URLsthat match a certain pattern or mask. By specifying an authentication scheme withthe Authentication directive, you can indicate that you want theapplication function called only for certain types of authentication. ServerInit - Customize the Server Initialization step Use this directive to specify a customized application function youwant the server to call during it's initialization routines.This code will be executed before any client requests are readand whenever the server is restarted. If you are using the GoServe modules in the PreExit or Service steps,you need to call the gosclone module here. The format of the directive is:    ServerInit d:\path\file:function_name d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program. Examples:    ServerInit   d:\ics\api\bin\icsext05.dll:svr_init    ServerInit   d:\www\dll\gosclone.dll:init Initial configuration file setting None. PreExit - Customize the PreExit step Use this directive to specify a customized application functionyou want the server to call during the PreExit step.This code will be executed after a client requesthas been read but before any other processing occurs.You can call the GoServe module during this step. The format of the directive is:    PreExit    d:\path\file:function_name d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled DLL,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program. Examples:    PreExit     d:\ics\api\bin\icsext05.dll:pre_exit    PreExit     d:\www\dll\gosclone.dll:goserve Initial configuration file setting None. Authentication - Customize the Authentication step Use this directive to specify a customized application function youwant the server to call during the Authentication step.This code will be executed based on the authentication scheme.Currently, only Basic authentication is supported. Note: Authentication is part of the authorization process;it only occurs when authorization is required. The format of the directive is:    Authentication type  d:\path\file:function_name type Specifies an authentication scheme whichfurther determine if your application function is called.Both an asterisk (*) and Basic are accepted values. d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program. Example    Authentication BASIC d:\ics\api\bin\icsextpgm.dll:basic_authen Initial configuration file setting None. NameTrans - Customize the Name Translation step Use this directive to specify a customized application function youwant the server to call during the Name Translation step.This code would supply the mechanism for translatingthe virtual path in the request to the physical path on the server,mapping URLs to specific objects. Note: This is not a terminal mapping rule.The transformed URL still has to match one of the terminal mapping ruledirectives, such as Exec, Fail, Map, Pass, Redirect, and Service. The format of the directive is:    NameTrans request-template d:\path\file:function_name [Server-IP-address or hostname] request-template A template for requests that further determineif your application function is called.The specification can include the protocol, domain and host, can bepreceded by a slash (/), and can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard.For example, /front_page.html,http://www.ics.raleigh.ibm.com,/pub*, /*, and * are all valid. d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program. Server-IP-address or hostname If you are using multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,determinesif your application function will be called only for requestscoming in on a specific IP address or for a specific host. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Example    NameTrans /index.html d:\api\bin\icsextpgm.dll:trans_url Initial configuration file setting None. Authorization - Customize the Authorization step Use this directive to specify a customized application function youwant the server to call during the Authorization step.This code would verify that the requested objectcan be served to the client.

Example    Authorization /index.html d:\api\bin\icsextpgm.dll:trans_url Initial configuration file setting None. ObjectType - Customize the Object Type step Use this directive to specify a customized application functionyou want the server to call during the Object Type step.This code would locate the requested object in the file systemand identify its MIME type. The format of the directive is:    ObjectType request-template d:\path\file:function_name request-template A template for requests that further determineif your application function is called.The specification can include the protocol, domain and host, can bepreceded by a slash (/), and can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard.For example, /front_page.html,http://www.ics.raleigh.ibm.com,/pub*, /*, and * are all valid. d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program. Example    ObjectType /index.html d:\api\bin\icsextpgm.dld:obj_type Initial configuration file setting None. Service - Customize the Service step Use this directive to specify a customized application function youwant the server to call during the Service step.This code would service the client request.For example, it sends the file or runs the CGI program. There is no default for this directive.If the request matches a Service rule (an application functionspecified on a Service directive is executed) but it returnsHTTP_NOACTION, the server will generate an error and therequest will fail. The format of the directive is:  Service request-template d:\path\file:function_name [Server-IP_address or hostname] request-template A template for requests that further determineif your application function is called.The specification can include the protocol, domain and host, can bepreceded by a slash (/), and can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard.For example, /front_page.html,http://www.ics.raleigh.ibm.com,/pub*, /*, and * are all valid. d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program. Server-IP_address or hostname If you use multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts,determines if your application function will be called only for requestscoming in on a specific IP address or for a specific host. Important migration note:Beginning with Version 4.2, a wildcard character can no longerbe specified for a server's IP address. Note: If you want full path translation, including query_string,you must have an asterisk (*) in both the request-template andin the d:\path\file:function_name as shown in thesecond example. Example    Service  /index.html d:\ics\api\bin\icsext05.dll:serve_req    Service  /cgi-bin/htimage* \ics\api\htimage:Htimage* Initial configuration file setting None. PICSDBLookup - Customize the PICS label retrieval step Use this directive to specify a customized application function youwant the server to call to retrieve PICS labels for a specified URL.Your function can either dynamically create a PICS label for therequested document or to search for a PICS label in an alternativefile or database. The format of the directive is:  PICSDBLookup request-template d:\path\file:function_name request-template A template for requests that further determineif your application function is called.The specification can include the protocol, domain and host, can bepreceded by a slash (/), and can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard.For example, /front_page.html,http://www.ics.raleigh.ibm.com,/pub*, /*, and * are all valid. d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program. Example    PICSDBLookup  /index.html d:\ics\api\bin\icsext05.dll:get_pics Initial configuration file setting None. DataFilter - Customize the Data Filter step Use this directive to specify a customized application function youwant the server to call during the Data Filter step.This code would provide three application functions: An open function to perform any initialization prior toprocessing the data A write function to process the data A close function to perform any clean up activities You can only have one DataFilter active for each instance of theserver. The format of the directive is:    DataFilter d:\path\file:function_name:function_name:function_name d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program.You will need to supply the name of the open, write, and close functions.

Example    Log       /index.html d:\api\bin\icsextpgm.dll:trans_url Initial configuration file setting None. Error - Customize the Error step Use this directive to specify a customized application functionyou want the server to call during the Error step.This code would execute only when an error is encounteredto provide customized error routines. The format of the directive is:    Error   request-template d:\path\file:function_name request-template A template for requests that further determineif your application function is called.The specification can include the protocol, domain and host, can bepreceded by a slash (/), and can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard.For example, /front_page.html,http://www.ics.raleigh.ibm.com,/pub*, /*, and * are all valid. d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program. Example    Error    /index.html d:\ics\api\bin\icsext05.dll:error_rtns Initial configuration file setting None. PostExit - Customize the PostExit step Use this directive to specify a customized application function youwant the server to call during the PostExit step.This code will be executed regardlessof the return codes from previous stepsor other PostExit handlers.It allows you to clean up any resources allocatedto process the request. The format of the directive is:    PostExit    d:\path\file:function_name d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program.

The format of the directive is:    ServerTerm   d:\path\file:function_name d:\path\file The fully qualified file name of your compiled program,including the extension. :function_name The name you gave your application function within your program. Example    ServerTerm  d:\ics\api\bin\icsext05.dll:shut_down Initial configuration file setting None. Servlet API Support - Configure the server for Java servlet API support Java support Use this directive to configure your server to support Sun's Javaservlet API. This will allow you to execute servlets thatextend the Java servlet interface and it's classes, asdefined in the java.servlet and java.servlet.http packages inSun's Java Servlet API White Paper(http://java.sun.com/products/jeeves//CurrentRelease/doc/api.html). A servlet is like a server-side applet thatruns on a Java threadbut does not have a user interface.Servlets are persistent; theyare instantiated and initialized just once when they areloaded and execute a servlet service() methodfor each request.This allows servlets to create dynamic output similar to CGI programs. Using the Java configuration directives, you have the ability to: Turn the servlet support on or off Specify the number of Javathreads to use to process servlet requests Name the directory where you keep the servlets Choose whether to log servlet messages and the location of the log Specify a servlet's initialization parameters On the Internet Connection Secure Server, servlets cannot be loaded from the network; theymust reside on the local system.Servlets must run in a separate process than the one in which theInternet Connection Secure Server is running. To ensure this, put all servlets inthe directory specified by the ServletDir directive. Note to servlet writers: When writing your servlets, you can write your own code for thefollowing servlet class methods(the service method is required and the others are optional): init() service(request,response) getServletInfo() destroy() All other java servlet API methods are implemented by the Internet Connection Secure Serverfor its processing and your use.Be sure you do not override any otherJava servlet API methods or you will be overriding the server'scode. EnableJavaServletSupport - Enable the server to support Java servlets Use this directive to specify whether or not you want your server tosupport Java servlets.If you specify no,the servlet support is turned off and all the other Java servletdirectives are ignored.If you specify yes,the servlet support is turned on, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)is started,and all the other Java servlet directives are implemented. The format of this directive is:    EnableJavaServletSupport value Example    EnableJavaServletSupport yes Default    EnableJavaServletSupport no MaxActiveJavaThreads - Specify threads for request processing Use this directive to specify the maximum number of Javathreads that the server will use to process Java servlets. The format of this directive is:    MaxActiveJavaThreads  number Example    MaxActiveJavaThreads  25 Default:    MaxActiveJavaThreads  10 ServletLog - Specify a log file for Java servlet messages Use this directive to specify the name and location of the log filefor Java servlet messages. All messages generated by the servlet logmethod will be written to this file. If you omit this directive,none of the messages generated by the servlet log methodwill be captured. Note: This log is notautomatically deleted on schedule like other server logs.You will have to monitor and control the size of this log yourself. The format of this directive is:    ServletLog   drive:\path\filename Example    ServletLog   D:\WWW\ics\logs\js-log-12 Default    ServletLog   c:\path\logs\servlet-log c:\path is replaced by the drive and directory whereyou installed the server.The default directory is C:\WWW. ServletDir - Specify the directory for Java servlets Use this directive to specify the name and location of the directorywhere you will keep all Java servlets. The format of this directive is:    ServletDir   drive:\path\directory Example    ServletDir   D:\WWW\ics\servlets\v42\public Default    ServletDir   c:\path\public c:\path is replaced by the drive and directory whereyou installed the server.The default directory is C:\WWW. Servlet - Specify a servlet's initialization parameters Use this directive to specify the name and value of the parameterspassed to a Java servlet when it is initialized.These must be listed one per line. The format of this directive is:    Servlet servlet-name {           parm0=value0           parm1=value1           parm2=value2           ....           parmn=valuen   } Example    Servlet MyServlet {       count=1       path=d:\w3\list   } Default None Proxy server settings - Configure server as a proxy Proxy server settings Use the directives described in this section to configureyour server as a caching proxy.See "Running your server as a proxy" for more information on proxy servers. CacheDefaultExpiry - Specify default expiration time for files that do not have an expiration date Use this directive to set a default expiration time for files thatthe server did not give either an Expires or a Last-Modified header to.You specify a URL template and the expiration timefor files with URLs that match the template.You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein the configuration file.Include a separate directive for each template.The URL template must include the protocol.Specify the time value in any combinationof months, weeks, days, and hours. Examples:    CacheDefaultExpiry ftp:* 1 month   CacheDefaultExpiry gopher:* 10 days Initial configuration file setting    CacheDefaultExpiry ftp:*  1 day   CacheDefaultExpiry gopher:*  1 day   CacheDefaultExpiry http:*  0 days Notice in the above defaults that the default expiration for HTTP is 0.HTTP should be kept at 0 because many script programs don'tgive an expiration date, yet their output expires immediately.(A value other than 0 may cause problems.) CacheExpiryCheck - Turn cache expirations off Use this directive to specify whether you wantthe server to return cached files that have expired.Specify Off for the value if you wantthe server to be able to return expired files.Use the default value of On if you do notwant the server to return expired files.Generally, you will not want the server to return expired files.An exception might be if you were demonstrating the server anddo not particularly care about the content being returned. Example    CacheExpiryCheck Off Initial configuration file setting    CacheExpiryCheck On CacheLastModifiedFactor - Specify fraction of Last-Modified time to be used for determining expiration date HTTP servers usually give the Last-Modified time for a file,but not the Expires date.Use this directive to have your server approximate theexpiration date of these files based on the Last-Modified time.The server uses the Last-Modified date to determine how longit has been since the file was modified.The server multiplies that length of time by the value on theCacheLastModifiedFactor directive.The server uses the result of this calculation to assignthe file an expiration date when it caches the file. Examples:    CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.2 The above example would cause files modifiedfive months ago to expire after one month.    CacheLastModifiedFactor Off The above example would turn this function off. Initial configuration file setting    CacheLastModifiedFactor 1.5 The default of 1.5 causes files modified in the past week to beupdated in one day. CacheLimit_1 - Specify lower limit for cached file size The server uses an algorythm for garbage collectionto determine which files to delete.The size of a file is part of the calculation.The size of small files is not taken into account in the calculation.The size of large files is taken into account;the larger the file, the more likely it is to be deleted. Use this directive to tell the server what should be considereda small file.The value can be specified in bytes (B), kilobytes (K),megabytes (M), or gigabytes (G).It does not matter if you have a space between the numberand the value (B, K, M, G). Example    CacheLimit_1 400 K Initial configuration file setting    CacheLimit_1 20 K CacheLimit_2 - Specify upper limit for cached file size Use this directive to specify the maximum size of files to becached. Files larger than this size will not be cached.The value can be specified in bytes (B), kilobytes (K),megabytes (M), or gigabytes (G).It does not matter if you have a space between the numberand the value (B, K, M, G). Example    CacheLimit_2 2000 K Initial configuration file setting    CacheLimit_2 400 K CacheLockTimeOut - Specify how long a file being cached can remain locked During retrieval, cache files are locked.If something goes wrong, a locked file may be left hanging.Use this directive to set the amount of time afterwhich the lock on the file can be broken.Specify the time value in minutes (mins). Note: Set CacheLockTimeOut to a value equal toor greater than OutputTimeOut.The default value of 20 minutes is thesame as the default for OutputTimeOut. Example    CacheLockTimeOut 30 mins Initial configuration file setting    CacheLockTimeOut 20 minutes CacheNoConnect - Specify stand alone cache mode Use this directive to specify whether you wantthe proxy server to retrieve files from remote servers.Use the default value of Off if you wantthe server to be able to retrieve files from remote servers. Specify On if you want theserver to run in stand alone cache mode.This means that the server can returnonly files already stored in its cache.Typically, you would also set the CacheExpiryCheck directiveto Off when running the server in this mode. Running the server in stand alone cache mode can be usefulif you are using the server for demonstrations.If you know all the files you want to use for a demonstrationare stored in the cache, then you do not need a network connection. Example    CacheNoConnect On In the above example, the server returns only files stored in its cache. Initial configuration file setting    CacheNoConnect Off CacheOnly - Cache only files with URLs that match a template Use this directive to specify that only files with URLsthat match the given template should be cached.You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein the configuration file.Include a separate directive for each template.The URL template must include the protocol. Example    CacheOnly http://realstuff/* Initial configuration file setting None CacheRoot - Specify cache root directory Use this directive to specify the top directory in the cache hierarchy.The server will create subdirectorieswithin this directory for each cached protocol.It will also create subdirectories under each protocol subdirectoryfor each remote server. Example    CacheRoot /webcache Initial configuration file setting None CacheSize - Specify cache size Use this directive to set the maximum amountof disk space you want the proxy cache to use.If you have plenty of disk space, you may wantto substantially increase the 5 M default size.The size of the cache will usually stay belowthe maximum, but may occasionally grow slightly larger.When the maximum size is reached, the garbage collection process begins.The value can be specified in bytes (B), kilobytes (K),megabytes (M), or gigabytes (G).It does not matter if you have a space between the numberand the value (B, K, M, G). Example    CacheSize 50 M Initial configuration file setting    CacheSize 5 M CacheUnused - Specify how long to keep unused cached files that match a template Use this directive to set the maximum amount of time for the serverto keep unused cached files with URLs matching a given template.The server deletes unused files with URLs matching thetemplate after they have been cached for the specified time,regardless of their expiration date.You can have multiple occurrences ofthis directive in the configuration file.Include a separate directive for each template.The URL template must include the protocol.Specify the time value in any combinationof months, weeks, days, and hours. Examples:    CacheUnused ftp:* 3 weeks   CacheUnused gopher:* 3 days 12 hours   CacheUnused * 4 weeks Initial configuration file setting None Caching - Turn proxy caching on/off Use this directive to enable the caching of files.With caching turned on, the proxy server can store the filesit retrieves from other servers in a local cache.The server can then respond to subsequent requests for thesame files without having to retrieve them from another servers.This can improve response time. Example    Caching On Initial configuration file setting    Caching Off ftp_proxy - Specify a proxy server for this proxy to connect to for FTP requests If your proxy server is part of a chain of proxies,use this directive to specify the name of another proxythat this server should contact for FTP requests. Example    ftp_proxy http://outer.proxy.server/ Initial configuration file setting None. Gc - Turn garbage collection on or off If you have enabled caching, the server uses the garbage collectionprocess to delete files that should no longer be cached.Files are deleted based on theirexpiration date and other proxy directive values.Use this directive to turn garbage collection on or off.Generally, you would not turn off garbagecollection if you have enabled caching.If you do, your cache file could growbeyond the maximum size you set for it. Assuming garbage collection is turned on, the garbage collectionprocess runs when the cache reaches its maximum size(as specified on the CacheSize directive).The garbage collection process will also runat the time of day specified on the GcDailyGc directive. Example    Gc On Initial configuration file setting    Gc Off GcDailyGc - Specify a daily time for garbage collection Use this directive to specify a particular time of dayto run the garbage collection process.Garbage collection occurs automaticallywhen the cache size limit is reached.By specifying a daily time for garbage collection you can alsoremove cached files before the cache reaches its maximum.Specify the time value in 24:00 hour format.Generally, you would want the garbage collection processto run when your server is not being used much for other things.This is why the default is 03:00. Example    GcDailyGc 22:00 The above example would start the garbage collection process at 10 PM.    GcDailyGc Off The above example would disable daily garbage collection. Initial configuration file setting    GcDailyGc 03:00 GcMemUsage - Specify how much memory to use for garbage collection Garbage collection works best if it can readall cache information into memory at one time.It may not be able to read in the entire cache if yoursystem does not have enough main memory. Use this directive to specify how much memory garbage collection can use.The value you specify should be approximately the amount of virtualmemory that the server may use while performing garbage collection.The amount of memory needed will vary based on dynamicchanges such as the directory structure of cached files.Specify the value as a number that represents kilobytes, but do not put a K next to the number. If garbage collection fails because there is not enough memoryon your system, set this directive to a smaller value.If you have plenty of memory to spare,you may want to set this value above the default of 500. Example    GcMemUsage 100 The example above might be usedfor a machine with a small amount of memory. Initial configuration file setting    GcMemUsage 1000 gopher_proxy - Specify a proxy server for this proxy to connect to for Gopher requests If your proxy server is part of a chain of proxies,use this directive to specify the name of another proxythat this server should contact for Gopher requests. Example    gopher_proxy gopher://outer.proxy.server/ Initial configuration file setting None. http_proxy - Specify a proxy server for this proxy to connect to for HTTP requests If your proxy server is part of a chain of proxies,use this directive to specify the name of another proxythat this server should contact for HTTP requests. Example    http_proxy http://outer.proxy.server/ Initial configuration file setting None. MaxContentLengthBuffer - Set the size of the buffer for dynamic data generated by the server Use this directive to set the size of the buffer for dynamic datagenerated by the server.Dynamic data isoutput from CGI programs, server-side includes, and API programs.It is data that does not come from a proxy request. The value can be specified in bytes (B), kilobytes (K),megabytes (M), or gigabytes (G).It does not matter if you have a space between the numberand the value (B, K, M, G). Example    MaxContentLengthBuffer 2 M Initial configuration file setting    MaxContentLengthBuffer 50 K no_proxy - Connect directly to domains matching templates Use this directive to specify the domains that you want the serverto directly connect to rather than going through a proxy. Specify the value as a string of domain names or domain name templates.Separate each entry in the string with a comma.Do not put any spaces in the string. You specify templates on this directive a bit differently thanthe way you specify templates on other directives.Most importantly, you cannot use the wildcard character (*).What you can do is specify a templateby including only the last part of a domain name.The server connects directly to any domains thatend with a string matching the templates you specify.The following example shows how this works. Example    no_proxy   www.someco.com,.raleigh.ibm.com,.some.host.org:8080 In the above example the server would not go through a proxy for thefollowing requests: Any requests to domains ending with www.someco.com, Any requests to domains ending with .raleigh.ibm.com,such as blugrass.raleigh.ibm.com or keystone.raleigh.ibm.com Any requests to port 8080 of domains ending with.some.host.org, such as myname.some.host.org:8080.(This would not include requests to any other ports of the same domain,such as myname.some.host.org, which assumes the default port 80.) Initial configuration file setting None. NoCaching - Do not cache files with URLs that match a template Use this directive to specify that the server should not cachefiles with URLs matching the given template.You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein the configuration file.Include a separate directive for each template.The URL template must include the protocol. Example    NoCaching http://joke/* Initial configuration file setting None. SocksServer - Specify a Socks server through which the proxy will pass requests Use this directive to specify the IP address or host name of theSocks server through which this proxy will be passing requests. Format    SocksServer SocksServer SocksNameServer where SocksServer is the IP address or the host nameof the Socks server to which the proxy should be chained, andSocksNameServer is the IP address or host nameof the Socks Name Server. Example    SocksServer socks.bcd.com socksname.bcd.com Initial configuration file setting None. wais_proxy - Specify a proxy server for this proxy to connect to for WAIS requests If your proxy server is part of a chain of proxies,use this directive to specify the name of another proxythat this server should contact for WAIS requests. Example    wais_proxy wais://outer.proxy.server/ Initial configuration file setting None. Performance settings - Define performance settings Performance settings Use the directives described in this section tocontrol the performance of your server. Each time your server receives a request from a client, it usesone or two threads to perform the requested action.(One thread if the server is not performing DNS lookup.Two threads if the server is performing DNS lookup.)If no threads are available, the server holdsrequests until more threads are available.The MaxActiveThreads directive specifies the maximum numberof active threads. If your server is running at maximum capacityon a sustained, non-stop basis, the amount of virtualmemory used increases.This increase is temporary and is alleviatedas the number of requests decline and the servercatches up on servicing requests. You can lower the amount of virtual memory used by loweringthe MaxActiveThreads setting.A good starting point would be half of your current MaxActiveThreadssetting.Keep in mind when you're lowering MaxActiveThreadsthat, when no threads are available, the server holdsrequests until more threads are available. Use the ServerPriority directive to specify the priorityyour operating system gives to the server. If you see a problem with your performance with your serverbeing too slow, it could be related to any of the following: Your network speed The traffic on your LAN The number of clients requesting from your server The number of threads set on your server Use the CacheLocalFile directive to load your most popularfiles into the servers memory at startup time.You can specify the maximum amount of memory and the maximumnumber of files for caching with the CacheLocalMaxBytes andCacheLocalMaxFiles directives. Use the PersistTimeout and the MaxPersistRequest directives tospecify the characteristics of a persistent connection.A persistent connection allows the server to accept multiple requestsand to send responses over the same TCP/IP connection.Overall throughput is increased because the serverdoes not have to establish a separate TCP/IP connection for each requestand response.Also, the TCP/IP connection is used more efficientlybecause a client can make multiple requests without waiting forthe response to each request. CacheLocalFile - Specify files you want to load in memory at start up Use this directive to specify the names of files you want to loadinto the server's memory each time you start the server.You can have multiple occurrences of this directivein the configuration file.Include a separate directive for each file you want to load into memory. By keeping your most frequently requested files loadedin the server's memory, you can improveyour server's response time for those files.For example, if you load your server's welcome page into memoryat startup, the server can handle requests for the page much morequickly than if it had to read the file from a disk.Keep in mind that for each file you load into memory, you aremaking that amount of memory unavailable for other uses. Before responding to a request for a filethat is stored in memory, the server checks to seeif the file has changed since the server was started.If the file has changed, the server respondsto the request with the updated file anddeletes the old version from its memory.To load the new file into memory, you need to restart the server. Notes: You can usean asterisk (*) as a wildcard character on the file names. File name matchingis not recursive. Only files in the specified directory willbe cached. No files in subdirectories are affected. Example To cache a specific file    CacheLocalFile   d:\www\html\index.html To cache all .html files in the powerco directory    CacheLocalFile   d:\www\powerco\*.html Default The default configuration includes CacheLocalFiledirectives for the HTML and graphics filesthat make up the server's Front Page. CacheLocalMaxBytes - Specify maximum amount of memory to use for file caching Use this directive to specify the maximum amount of memory you want toallow for file caching. You can specify the memory inkilobytes (K) or megabytes (M). You must still specify the filesthat you want cached with the CacheLocalFiles directive. Note: CacheLocalMaxBytes can help limit your cache sizewhen you are using the wildcard character to specify thefiles on the CacheLocalBytes directive. Example    CacheLocalMaxBytes   5K Default    CacheLocalMaxBytes   2M CacheLocalMaxFiles - Specify the maximum number of files for caching Use this directive to specify the maximum number of files you want tobe cached at one time. You must still usethe CacheLocalFiles directive to indicate which files you want cached. Note: CacheLocalMaxFiles can help limit your cache sizewhen you are using the wildcard character to specify thefiles on the CacheLocalFiles directive. Example    CacheLocalMaxFiles   150 Default    CacheLocalMaxBytes   200 LiveLocalCache - Specify whether the cache is updated when a cached file is modified Use this directive to specify whether or not the cache is updated whena cached file is modified.Specify ON if you want users requesting a cached file to get thefile with the latest updates.OFF is the high performance setting. Initial configuration file setting    LiveLocalCache off Program default setting    LiveLocalCache off MaxActiveThreads - Specify the maximum number of threads to have active Use this directive to set the maximum number ofthreads that you want to have active at one time.If the maximum is reached, the server holds new requests untilanother request finishes and threads become available.Generally, the more power your machine has,the higher the value you should use for this directive.If your machine starts to spend too much time on overhead tasks,such as swapping memory, try reducing this value.The recommended value is 40.Unpredictable results may occur if this value is exceeded. Example    MaxActiveThreads   49    MaxActiveThreads   35 Initial configuration file setting    MaxActiveThreads   40 ServerPriority - Specify the priority you want your server to have on your system Use this directive to specify a priority classfor the Internet Connection Secure Server.The operating system uses priority classes to determinewhich processes have priority over others. Valid values are: 0 - no priority 1 - maximum priority as a normal process 2 - maximum priority as a foreground server process You may want to use a value of 0 if the machine your serveris running on is also processing other types of requests. Example    ServerPriority   0 Default:    ServerPriority   1 MaxPersistRequest - Specify the maximum number of requests to receive on a persistent connection Use this directive to specify the maximum number of requests the servershould receive on a persistent connection. When determining this number,be sure to consider the number of images used in your pages. Each imagerequires a separate request. The format of this directive is: MaxPersistRequest number number is the number of requests the server should receive fora persistent connection. Initial configuration file setting:    MaxPersistRequest 5 Program default setting:    MaxPersistRequest 5 PersistTimeout - Specify time to wait for the client to send another request Use this directive to specify the amount of time the server should waitbetween client requests before cancelling a persistentconnection. The server uses a different timeout,the input timeout, to determine how long towait for the client to send the first request after the connectionis established.For more information on the input timeout, see "InputTimeout - Specify input timeout setting". After the server sends its firstresponse, it uses the persistent timeout to determine how long itshould wait for each subsequent request before cancelling the persistentconnection. The format of this directive is: PersistTimeout  time time can be any valid time increment, but usually will beseconds or minutes Initial configuration file setting:    PersistTimeout 1 minutes Program default setting:    PersistTimeout 1 minutes UseACLs - Specify whether ACL files will be checked Use this directive to specify whether the ACL fileswith be checked for file protection.Set this directive to never or protect onlyfor better server performance.The format of the directive is:    UseACLs setting The setting can have a value of always, protect only, or never. always The server will always look for an ACL file on every file request. protect only The server will only look for an ACL file when the file request isfor a file that is covered by a protection statement. never The server will never look for an ACL file on a file request. Example    UseACLs protectonly Initial configuration file setting    UseACLs always UseMetaFiles - Specify whether meta files will be used Use this directive to specify whether the meta files used by the server.Set this directive to off for better server performance.The format of the directive is:    UseMetaFiles setting The setting can have a value of on or off. on The server will always use meta files. off The server will not use meta files. Example    UseMetaFiles off Initial configuration file setting    UseMetaFiles on System Management - Define system management settings System Management Use the directives described in this section to define settingsused to monitor and manage the health, throughput, and activityof your servers. SNMPCommunityName - Providing a security password for SNMP Use this directive to define the password between the Internet Connection Secure ServerDPI subagent and the SNMP agent.The SNMP community name authorizes a user to view the performancevariables monitored by SNMP for a particular community of servers.The system administrator defines which variables from whichservers can be viewed when a password is entered.If you change this value, you must also add the new community nameto the SystemView AgentSNMP Configuration Notebook.For more information about creating a community name,refer to "Providing a security password for SNMP". The form of the directive is: SNMPCommunityName com_nam Example SNMPCommunityName public Initial configuration file setting SNMPCommunityName public Program default setting SNMPCommunityName public WebMasterEmail - Creating an e-mail address to receive SNMP problem reports Use this directive to create an e-mail addressto receive SNMP problem reports.The default mail address is webmaster. The form of the directive is: WebMasterEmail webmastermailaddress Example WebMasterEmail webmaster@computer.com Initial configuration file setting WebMasterEmail webmaster [ Top of Page | Previous Page | Next Page | Table of Contents ] WT03-B16-3IA074-000483-B008-46http://acc123.usc.edu:80/Docs/icswg006.html 128.125.48.102 19970125004247 text/html 42015HTTP/1.1 200 Document follows.

This chapter explains how to tailor theaccess and error logs to meet your needs, and also how createcustomized reports from the information in the logs. Partial Table-of-Contents Tailoring the logs your server keeps Specifying global settings for all logs Specifying options for the access, agent, and referer logs Specifying options for the error logs Sample scenario for configuring log files Specifying the path for the proxy server's cache access log Tailoring the reports your server creates Overview of report templates Creating a report template Viewing reports Sample scenarios for configuring reports Tailoring the logs your server keeps The server creates many types of logs.Each day at midnight, the server closes the logs for that day and createsnew logs. The server logs activity in the access log filesand stores them on the hard drive each night.At midnight each night, the server closes the current access log andcreates a new access log file for the coming day.The access log contains entries for page request mode to the server. For each access request your server receives, anentry is made in the access log showing: What was requested When it was requested Who requested it The method of the request The type of file that yourserver sent in response to the request The return code, which indicateswhether the request was honored The server can also create an agent log and areferer log.The agent logindicates which Web browser was used to access a Web page.The referer log identifies the Web page that referred (or linked to)the requested Web page.By default the server writes an entry to the agent and refererlogs each timea client sends the server a request.For every entry made in the access log: The agent log has a correspondingentry that indicates the browser used to display thepage or file requested by the client The referer log has a correspondingentry that indicates the referring page The server createsan error log that includes errors encounteredby your server's clients, such as timing out or not getting access. The server also creates a CGI error log thatlogs standard error output (stderr) from CGIprograms. If your server is running as a proxy, the server can create twodifferent types of logs: A proxy access log, which contains access requestsfor files that come from the proxy server A cache access log, which contains access requestsfor files that come from the proxy server's cache This section describes how to set up thelogs to suit your particular needs.If you are satisfied with the default setting for an option,you can skip the step.Look at the sections that apply to you: If you want to change the default global settings,read "Specifying global settings for all logs". If you want to set up your access, agent, and referer logs,read "Specifying options for the access, agent, and referer logs". If you want to set the path and the maintenance options foryour error and CGI error logs, read "Specifying options for the error logs". If you want to set the path for your proxy server's cache access log,read "Specifying the path for the proxy server's cache access log". Note: You can change the default settings for the logs either by usingthe online Configuration and Administration forms or by manually editingthe directives in the configuration file. Specifying global settings for all logs In most cases, you will want to accept the default global settings,which apply to all logs. If you plan to use the reporting functions described under"Tailoring the reports your server creates", you must accept the default file format, common. If you want to have log information sent to the Internet Connection Secure Server windowin addition to sending it to the log files, you must change the default. To change the global settings, we recommend that you specify themon the Global Log File Configuration form. Defaults Common file format, which is used by most Web serversand local time format are used.By default, access log information is written only to the access log,(not the syslog) anderror log information is written only to the error log,(not the syslog). Directives For time stamp, edit the LogTime directive. For file format, edit the LogFormat directive. For logging to the Internet Connection Secure Server window, edit the LogToGUI directive. You cannot change whether the logs are written nightly. Specifying options for the access, agent, and referer logs This section describes the following tasks: "Specifying the access, agent, and referer log paths" "Choosing log maintenance options for the access, agent, and referer logs" "Setting filters for the access, agent, and referer logs" Specifying the access, agent, and referer log paths From the Access Log File Configuration form,you can specify the path and name of the directorywhere you want to place the access, agent, and referer log files.The directory must be on an HPFS-formatted drive. Defaults We strongly recommend that you accept the default path, which isthe value you entered for Logs directory at installation. Directives For the access log path, edit the AccessLog directive. For the agent log path, edit the AgentLog directive. For the referer log path, edit the RefererLog directive. Choosing log maintenance options for the access, agent, and referer logs With the log maintenance options, you can specify howto handle the accumulation of daily logs for days past. You can choose whether you want to keep old logs, remove logsafter they reach a certain age and/or a collective size,or run your own program at midnight each night to handle old logs.Note that the "collective size" is the collective size of all accesslogs only (not combined with agent and referer logs), or of all agentlogs only (not combined with access and referer logs), or of all refererlogs only (not combined with access and agent logs). To reduce the space the access, agent, and referer logs require,you can specify that the logs be automatically removed,based on the age of the log and/or the collective size of the logs. If you are interested in running your own backup programto store the logs, you can specify a user exit.In this case, you specify the path to your program and the parametersto pass to your program.The server appends to this information thepath to the logs on your hard drive. We recommend you define these options on theAccess Log File Configuration form, but you can editthe configuration file to include the appropriate directives.The settings you specify on the Access Log File Configurationformapply to agent and referer logs, as well. Defaults By default, all access, agent, and referer log files are kept onthe hard drive at the path location you specify on theAccess Log File Configuration form.(or the AccessLog, AgentLog, and RefererLog directives). Directives The directives you specify for access logs apply to agent and refererlogs, as well. To keep access log files, no directive is required.AccessLogArchive none is the default. To remove access log files based on age, edit these directives: AccessLogArchive purge AccessLogExpire number-of-days To remove access log files based on collective size, edit thesedirectives: AccessLogArchive purge AccessSizeLimit number-of-megabytes To run a user exit, edit theAccessLogArchive userexit directive. For details on these directives, refer to "AccessLogArchive - Remove existing access, agent, or referer log files or run a user exit". Setting filters for the access, agent, and referer logs For the access log, you can set filters so that the access, agent,and referer logsincludes only the information you are interested in. To improve your ability to use the information included in theaccess, agent, and referer logfiles, you can filter out extraneous information so that the log includesonly information that is meaningful to you.You filter out information by excludingentries that match a particular pattern.We recommend you define these options on theAccess Log File Configuration form, but you can editthe configuration file to include the appropriate directivesfor the filters you want to set.You can specify filters based on any of the following: URL (directories and/or files) IP address or host name Method MIME type Return code Note: Keep in mind that information filtered out from the access logwill not show up in any access report and will not be available forfuture use. Here are some reasons for controlling what gets logged. To reduce the size of the logs:You might be interested in reducing the number of entries in anaccess log to include only meaningful access requests.Access log files can grow rapidly, since by default they contain entriesfor all access requests for GIF images, HTML pages, and so on.You might want to configure your access logs so that they includelog entries for access requests to HTML pages, but not for theaccess requests for the GIF images that the HTML contains.For example, an HTML page might include several GIF images,which can cause the size of the access log to grow rapidly. To collect information about external hits only:You might be interested only in who is accessing your server fromoutside your company.In this case, you would filter out access requests that originatefrom internal company IP addresses. To gather information about who is accessing a particularWeb site:To help you determine the size of the audiencefor a particular Web site, you might want to createan access log that shows only the hits to one URL. Default By default, everything is logged to the access log, unless youchoose to filter out (exclude) something.From theAccess Log File Configuration form, you can specifywhat you want to filter out from the access log.You do not need to fill in the entire form. Scroll to theExclusions from the Access log section of the form.Choose which of the following you want to base filtering on: Directories and files Host names or IP addresses Methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) MIME types (images, text, applications, audio, video, multimedia,and other) Return code (success, redirection, client error, and servererror) If you want to filter based on directories and files or IP addressesand host names, you need to update the index liston theAccess Log File Configuration form.You can insert or remove entries in the list to specify whatyou want filtered out.To exclude entries based on methods, MIME types, or return codes,click the boxes that describe what you want to filter out. When you have finished specifying what you want to exclude on theAccess Log File Configuration form,click Apply to have the filters take effect. Directives To filter out files or directories that match a particular pattern,edit the AccessLogExcludeURL directive. To filter out entries of a particular method,edit the AccessLogExcludeMethod directive. To filter out entries of a particular MIME type, edit theAccessLogExcludeMimeType directive. To filter out entries receiving a particular set of return codes,edit the AccessLogExcludeReturnCode directive. Specifying options for the error logs This section describes the following tasks: "Specifying the path for the error and CGI error logs" "Choosing log maintenance options for the error and CGI error logs" Specifying the path for the error and CGI error logs From the Error Log File Configuration form,you can specify the path and name of the directorywhere you want to place the error and CGI error log files.The directory must be on an HPFS-formatted drive.As an alternative, you can specify this information manually by editingthe directive listed below. Defaults We strongly recommend that you accept the default path, which isthe value you entered for Logs directory at installation. Directives For path, edit the ErrorLog directive. Choosing log maintenance options for the error and CGI error logs You can choose whether you want to keep old logs,remove logs after they reach a certain age and/or acollective size, or run your own programat midnight each night to handle old logs.Note that the "collective size" is the collective size of allerror logs only(not combined with CGI error logs) or all CGI error logs only(not combined with error logs). To reduce the space error and CGI error logs require,you can specify that the logs be automatically removed,based on the age of the log and/or the collective size of the logs. If you are interested in running your own backup programto store the logs, you can specify a user exit.In this case, you specify the path to your program and the parametersto pass to your program.The server appends to this informationthe path to the logs on your hard drive. Default By default, all error and CGI errorlog files are kept on the hard drive at thepath location you specify on theError Log File Configuration form(or the ErrorLog directive.) We recommend you define these options on theError Log File Configuration form, but you can editthe configuration file to include the appropriate directives.The settings you specify on theError Log File Configuration formapply to CGI error logs, as well. Directives The directives you specify for error logs apply to CGI errorlogs, as well. To keep error log files, no directive is required.ErrorLogArchive none is the default. To remove error log files based on age, edit these directives: ErrorLogArchive purge ErrorLogExpire number-of-days To remove error log files based on collective size, edit thesedirectives: ErrorLogArchive purge ErrorSizeLimit number-of-megabytes To run a user exit, edit theErrorLogArchive userexit directive. For details on these directives, refer to "ErrorLogArchive - Remove existing error or CGI error log files or run a user exit". Sample scenario for configuring log files In the following example, you have just purchasedand installed the Internet Connection Secure Server.You want to set up your server tolog access information and error information in the following ways: You want both types of logs touse a local time stamp and a common log file format. You want the access logs to be purged when they are more than 30 daysold and/or when they reach a collective size of 25 megabytes.You do not want following requests to be logged to the access log: Requests for GIF images Requests from hosts with IP addresses that match 9.67.*.* Redirection requests (requests that yield a return codebetween 300 and 399) You do not want the error logs to be purged. You can specify these criteria by using the Configuration andAdministration forms, or by updating the configuration filedirectives. Forms Use the Global Log File Configuration Settings formto set the time and file format Use theAccess Log File Configuration form to: Set the interval for removing old access logs Exclude the MIME type of images/GIF Exclude requestsfrom hosts with IP addresses in the pattern 9.67.*.* Exclude requests that yield a return code between 300 and 399 Specify the path for the access log file Use the Error Log File Configuration formto indicate that you want to keep the error log files. Directives For the above scenario, update the configurationfile as follows: LogFormat                           CommonLogTime                             LocalTimeAccessLogArchive                    purgeAccessLogExpire                     30AccessLogSizeLimit                  25AccessLogExcludeURL                 *.gifNoLog                               9.67.*.*AccessLogExcludeReturnCode          300ErrorLogArchive                     none Specifying the path for the proxy server's cache access log If the server is running as a proxy, you can log requests to the cacheseparately from other requests. From theAccess Log File Configuration form,you can specify the path and file namewhere you want the server to put access requests thatare satisfied from the proxy server's cache.As an alternative, you can specify this information manuallyby editing the directives listed below. For more information, refer to "CacheAccessLog - Specify the path for the cache access log files". Directives For the cache access log path, edit the CacheAccessLog directive,in addition to those described under "CacheAccessLog - Specify the path for the cache access log files". Tailoring the reports your server creates Several types of files are used in report creation.These files are located in the reports root directory Access log data file, named access.mmddyyyy Report data file, named template_name.txt Report template file, named template_name.log Report template list, named Templates The access log data file(access.mmddyyyy) corresponds to thehttpd-log.mmddyyyy file that is in the access log directory.For each entry in the access log file, there is an entry in the accesslog data file.The format of the data in the access log data file is: IP_address URL seconds_since_1970 number_of_bytes_transferred method code The report data file(template_name.txt) includes data from all theaccess log data files filtered through the template definition.For example, for the template "Top100", there is a data filecalled Top100.txt, which corresponds to all the access.mmddyyyyfiles filtered through the Top100 template definition and saved to theTop100.txt data file.The format of the data in the report data file is: IP_address URL seconds_since_1970 number_of_bytes_transferred method code The report template file(template_name.log) is the definition of the template.For example, the template "Top100" has a Top100.log fileassociated with it, which consists of the Top100 template definitionin an ASCII file. The report template list (the file name is Templates)is a list of all the templates that have been defined. Before you can see a report, you must create a report templatethat is stored as the report template file.For instructions on how to create a report template, see "Overview of report templates". Your server creates reports that include some or all of thecontents of the access logs.At midnight each night, the server closes the current access log andcreates a new access log file for the coming day.Reports are generated at that time using the access log that was justclosed.Reports can also be generated for logs that have been archived. Note: If you have specified the CacheAccessLog directive or if youhave indicated on theAccess Log File Configuration form a pathand file name for the proxy server's cache access log, yourreports will not contain access requests for cached files.If you do not have a cache access log, access requestsfor a proxy server are logged in the access log and can be includedin an access report. Overview of report templates You control what is included in reports byfiltering out entries that match a particular pattern.These options are defined either by using theConfiguration and Administrationforms or by editing the configuration file.You can use the forms or the configuration file tospecify filters based on any of the following: URL (directories and files) IP address or host name Method Return code The contents of the report are governed by the following factors: The log filefilters that were in effect when the log file was created The report filters that are in effect when the report is created At report creation time, you control only the reportfilters that are currently in effect.You cannot include in the report entries that were filtered out fromthe log file. You can specify report filters in two ways; you must decide whichis easier in your situation. If you want to include in your reportonly a small percentage of the contents of the access log,it might be simplest to specify what to include,rather than everything you want to exclude.Think of specifying one or a few include filters as a shortcutto specifying many exclude filters. If you want to include in your report most of the contentsof the access log, it might be simplest to specifywhat to exclude, rather than everything you want to include. In some cases, you will find it simplestto specify both include and exclude filters.In this case, it is important to understandhow include and exclude filters work together.The include filters are processed first.The report function searches the access log to find all entriesthat match any include filter patterns.If several include filters are specified,the filters act as OR Boolean expressions.In other words, entries that match at least oneof the include filters are included. The exclude filters are processed after all include filtershave been processed.The exclude filters work only on the set of entries that have beenalready included by the include filters.For clarification, refer to the examples under "Sample scenarios for configuring reports". The include and exclude filters are specified on theAccess Log Report Template Creation formor can be specified withthe AccessReport directives. Here are some reasons for controlling what gets reported. To reduce the scope of the report:You might be interested in reducing the scope of the report so thatit includes only a portion of what is contained in the log.You can even create several reports, each to gather differentinformation from the same log.You might want to create your report template so that it includeslog entries for access requests to HTML pages, but not for theaccess requests for the GIF images that the HTML contains. To collect information about external hits only:You might be interested only in who is accessing your server fromoutside your company.In this case, you would filter out access requests that originatefrom internal company IP addresses. To gather information about who is accessing a particularWeb site:To help you determine the size of the audience for a particularWeb site, you might want to create a report that shows only the hitsto one URL. To discover the top Web pages on your server:To help you determine the popularity of a particular Web site, youfilter out everything in the report, except for the most visitedWeb pages. Creating a report template Before you create a report, you must modify or create a report templatethat outlines what you want the report to contain.To start configuring a report template, choose one of the followingoptions from the Access Log Report Templates form: If you want to createa report that is very different from your existing reports,choose Create a new template. If you have never created a report, beforeit might be easier to copy an existing template and edit the copy,rather than creating a new template.To use an existing report template as the basis of a newreport, choose Copy existing template. To update an existing report template, chooseEdit existing template. To delete an existing report template, chooseDelete existing template. When you choose Create a new template or Edit existingtemplate, the Access Log Report Template Creationform appears. When you have finished filling in the form, choose Apply. On this form, you can specify some or all of the following: Basic settings, such as the report name, description, andthe number of entries to include in the report (for example, thetop 10) Entries from the access log that you want to exclude from thereport (based on directories and file names, host names or IP addresses,methods, or return codes) Entries from the access log that you want to include (as ashortcut to many excludes) Specifying entries to include is a shortcut to specifying many,many excludes.When you want to include only a few types of entries in the report,it is easier to specify what to include rather than excludingnearly everything.For example, if you want to include only access requests for aparticular URL, you would include that URL, rather than excludingall the others. The Access Log Report Template Creation formallows you to specify includes and excludes.It is important to understand how includes andexcludes affect each other. In the index list, if nothing is listed with a Filter Action of"Include", the entire log is included in the report, minus theentries that are excluded. If anything is listed with a Filter Action of "Include",the report will contain only the information that is to beincluded, minus the entries that are excluded. If you are using the Access Log Report Templates form, you seeat the bottom of the form the field Report root directory.This field is filled in with a default directory.We recommend that you accept the default, rather than changing it.If you choose to change the default, you will need to create a newdirectory for the path you specify, give the directory theappropriate permissions and add a PASS statement to enable the serverto honor requests to store access logs in that directory. Viewing reports To see a report,from the Configuration and Administration Form page,choose Access reports.From there, select the following options: Report template One of the following filters: URL (directories and files) IP address or host name Method Return code Date range The report is created and displayed after you select the options. Sample scenarios for configuring reports You have just purchased and installed the Internet Connection Secure Server andyou want to set up your server to automatically generate four differentaccess log reports.

Date and time The current date and time are displayed on the Web page. Text User-specified text is displayed on the Web page. Configuration instructions To use the htcounter program: Uncomment lines in the server configuration filefor the functions you are using. Page count:   # Service  /cgi-bin/apicounter* server_root/cgi-bin/htcounter:HTCounter* Date and time:   # Service  /cgi-bin/datetime* server_root/cgi-bin/htcounter:HTCounter* Text:   # Service  /cgi-bin/text2gif* server_root/cgi-bin/htcounter:HTCounter* For server_root, enter the directorywhere the server is installed.The default directory is C:\WWW\Bin. Create the counter file and initialize the counter. The Web administrator must create the counter fileand initialize the counter to some value, for example, 0.This enables the Web administrator to control access to the Web siteand to Web site resources used to display the requested information. The counter file must be located in theserver_root\Counters directory. Sample counter files are located inthe server_root\HTML directory,or you can go to the following URLs:    http://your.server.name/counter1.html   http://your.server.name/counter2.html The sample files include an explanation of error messagesthat may be issued by the htcounter programwhen you begin using the counter file. Insert lines in the Web page HTML filefor the functions you are using. Page count: Note: In the previous example, everything should be on one line. Date and time: Text: For your.server.name, enter the fully qualified name ofyour host, for example, http://www.ibm.com. For counter_name, enter the name of the counter fileyou created, for example, cntfile.cnt. Options This section describes the options you can use for displayingthe page count, date, time, and text on your Web page. Notes: Defaults are shown in bold letters. Option names and values are not case-sensitive. Use an ampersand (&) to separate options. For example, to display a page counter with a foreground color ofblue and a background color of white, use the following URL: The RRGGBB color option allows you to specify the colorusing a hexadecimal color code, where RR, GG,and BB are the hexadecimal digits that specify theRed, Green, and Blue values of the color.Examples of color values are:    Black       000000   Red         FF0000   Orange      FFA500   Green       00FF00   Blue        0000FF   Yellow      FFFF00   White       FFFFFF For example, to display a page counter with a foreground colorof yellow, you would use the following URL: For more colors demonstrated online, see Lem Apperson'sColor Index at http://www.infi.net/wwwimages/colorindex.html. Common options FG=color where color specifies the foreground color, and can be: Black White Red Green Blue RRGGBB BG=color where color specifies the background color, and can be: Transparent Black White Red Green Blue RRGGBB BorderColor=color where color specifies the border color, and can be: Green Black White Red Blue RRGGBB BorderWidth=width where width specifies the widthof the border around the image, and can be: 0 No border (the default) n The number n determines the thickness of the border. Example: Figure 3. Example of the BorderWidth option BorderIndent=highlighting where highlighting specifies highlighting forupper and right border edges (3D beveled effect), and can be: In Upper and right border edges are shaded. Out Lower and left border edges are lighter. Example: Figure 4. Example of the BorderIndent option BorderIndentColor=color where color specifies the colorfor the border edge (3D beveled effect), and can be: BorderColor Black White Red Green Blue RRGGBB BorderIndentWidth=width where width specifies the width of theborder edge (3D beveled effect), and can be: 0 No border edge (the default) n The number ndetermines the thickness of the border edge. Example: Figure 5. Example of the BorderIndentWidth option FontName=font where font specifies the font used,and can be: Block1 LCD FontSize=size where size specifies the font size (width x height),and can be: 8x12 7x11 9x13 10x14 Example: Figure 6. Example of Fonts and Font Sizes Counter option Format=format where formatspecifies the format for displaying the counter_value,and can be: %%d No padding %%nd Pad with blanks;width=n %%0n%d Pad with zeros;width=n Example: Figure 7. Example of counter format options Date and time option Format=strftime()-format Specifies the format for displaying thedate and time: Default: http_time format strftime()-format Use %20 to represent a blank. For all other options, see Table 3. Timebase=time Specifies the time used: Local GMT (Greenwich mean time) Example: Figure 8. Example of date and time formats Text to gif option Text=string Specifies the textstring that will be converted to a gif.Use %20 to represent a blank. Example: The following URLs show an example of how you can displaytext and page count on a Web page: The URLs in this example display the following informationon the Web page: This Web page has been accessed n times since January 1, 1997. In this example: The text is displayed in black (default)using a transparent background. The page count (n)is displayed in red on a white background. Using server-side includes to insert information into CGI programs and HTML documents Server-side includes allow you to insert information intoCGI programs and HTML documents that the server sends to the client.This section describes the command format for using server-side includesand explains how to use the commands neededto make server-side includeswork in your CGI programs andHTML documents. Considerations for using server-side includes Before using server-side includes on your server,there are a few issues you should consider.One issue is performance.Performance can be significantly impacted when the serveris processing files while sending them.Another issue is security.Letting ordinary users execute commands can be a security risk.Be very careful when deciding which directories you useserver-side includes in and which directories you usethe exec command in.You can minimize the security riskif you do not enable the exec command. You should also note that you cannot reference files recursively.For example, if you are running file sleepy.htmland the program finds <--!#include file="sleepy.html" -->the server doesn't detect the error and the server loops untilthe server abends.However, you can reference files within files.For example, file sleepy.html referencesfile smiley.html and file smiley.htmlreferences dopey.html. Preparing to use server-side includes To use server-side includes, you need to add theAddType directive to your configuration file.Two examples follow: Examples:    AddType .shtml text/x-ssi-html 8 bit 1.0   AddType .htmls text/x-ssi-html 8 bit 1.0 Note: If you use file extensions other than .shtml or .htmls,you should check the AddType directive to seeif that extension already exists.See the configuration file, appendix listing,or the MIME form for a list of existing AddType directives. You can also use the imbeds directive to specifywhether server-side includes can be used in HTML documents,CGI programs, or both.Examples of this directive follow: Examples:    imbeds value   imbeds on Default:imbeds on For more information about the imbeds directive,see "imbeds - Specify whether server-side includes will be dynamically imbedded". The server does not process your error files for imbeds, regardlessof the file extensions or use of the imbeds directive. Format for server-side includes The current date, the size of a file, the last change of a fileare examples of the kind of information that can be sent to the client.There are commands that need to be includedin the HTML document comments.The commands have the following format: Syntax The following is the syntax format for enabling server-sideincludes on the server:    <!--#directive tag=value ... -->   <!--#directive tag="value" ... --> The quotes around value are optional.They are required for imbedding spaces. Directives for server-side includes This section explains the directives that are acceptedby the server for server-side includes. config - controls file processing Use this directive to control certain aspects of file processing.Valid tags are cmntmsg, errmsg, sizefmt, and timefmt. cmntmsg - specify the message appended to the beginning of text Use this tag to specify the message that gets appendedto the beginnning of any text that follows adirective specification and comes before "-->". Example:    <!--#config cmntmsg="[This is a comment]" -->   <!--#echo var=" " extra text --> Result: (Output from the echo)<!--This is a comment extra text --> Default:[the following was extra in the directive] errmsg - specify the message sent to the client Use this directive to specify the message that gets sentto the client if an error occurs when a file is being processed.The message gets logged in the server's error log. Example:    <!--#config errmsg="[ An error occurred]" --> Default:"[an error occurred while processing this directive]" sizefmt - specify file size format Use this directive to specify the format to be used whenthe file size is displayed.In the following examples,bytes is the value used for a formattednumber of bytes. abbrev is used for displayingthe number of kilobytes or megabytes. Example 1:    <!--#config sizefmt = bytes -->   <!--#fsize file=foo.html --> Result: 1024 Example 2:    <!--#config sizefmt=abbrev -->   <!--#fsize file=foo.html --> Result: 1K Default: "abbrev" timefmt - specify date format Use this directive to specify the format to be usedwhen providing dates. Example:    <!--#config timefmt="%T %D" -->   <!--#flastmod file=foo.html --> Result: "10/18/95 12:05:33" Default: "%a, %d %b-%Y %T %Z" The following strftime() formats are valid with the timefmt tag: Table 3.

century.                                                                                      %Z                     Replace with the name of the time zone or no                                  characters if the time zone is unknown.                                                                                            The operating system configuration determines the full andabbreviated month names and years. echo - specify environment variables Use this directive to display the value forspecified environment variables using the var tag.If a variable is not found, a (None) is displayed.The following environment variables can be displayed: DATE_GMT The current date and time in Greenwich Mean Time.The formatting of this variable is defined using theconfig timefmt directive. DATE_LOCAL The current date and local time.The formatting of this variable is defined using theconfig timefmt directive. DOCUMENT_NAME This is the name of the topmost document.If the HTML was generated by a CGI,this will contain the name of the CGI. DOCUMENT_URI The full URL the client entered, without the query string. LAST_MODIFIED The current date and time that the current documentwas last modified.The formatting of this variable is definedusing the config timefmt directive. QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED The search query sent by the client.This is undefined unless HTML was generated by a CGI. SSI_DIR The path of the current file, relative to SSI_ROOT.If the current file is in SSI_ROOT, this value is "/". SSI_FILE The file name of the current file. SSI_INCLUDE The value used in the include command that retrieved this file.This is not defined for the topmost file. SSI_PARENT The path and file name of the includer, relative to SSI_ROOT. SSI_ROOT The path of the topmost file. All include requests must be in this directory or a child of this directory. Example:    <!--#echo var=SSI_DIR --> Also, echo can display a value set by theset or global directives. exec - specify CGI programs Use this directive to include the output of a CGI program.Exec discards any HTTP headers CGI outputs EXCEPT for: content-type determines whether to parse the body ofthe output for other Includes. content-encoding determines if translation needs to be done (ebcdic/ascii). last-modified replaces the current last modified header value if it is later. cgi - specify CGI program URL Use this directive to specify the URL of a virtual path to aCGI program. Example 1:    <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/program/path_info?query_string"--> In the example, program is the cgi programto be executed, path_info are the parameterpassed to the program as environment variables, andquery_string are the parameters passed tothe program as environment variables. Example 2:    <!--#exec cgi="&path;&cgiprog;&pathinfo;&querystring;"--> Example 2 shows the use of variables. flastmod - display time and date document was changed Use this directive to display the last time and datethe document was changed.The formatting of this variable is defined usingthe config timefmt directive.The file and virtual tagsare valid with this directive, and the meaning is the same as it isfor the include directive. Directive Formats: <!--#flastmod file="/path/file" --> <!--#flastmod virtual="/path/file" --> Example:    <!--#flastmod file="FOO" extra text --> Result:12May96 <!--This is extra text--> fsize - display file size Use this directive to display the size of the specified file.The formatting of this variable is definedusing the config sizefmt directive.The file and virtual tags are validwith this directive, and the meaning is the same as it isfor the include directive. Examples:    <!--#fsize file="/path/file" -->   <!--#fsize virtual="/path/file" --> Result:1K global - defines global variables Use this directive to define global variables that can beechoed later by this file, or any included files. Example:    <!--#global var=VariableName value="Some Value" --> include - includes a document in output Use this directive to include a document (the text froma document) in the output.The file and virtual tagsare valid with this directive: file - specify file name Use this tag to specify the name of a file. For flastmod, fsize,and include, file is assumed to berelative to SSI_ROOT if preceded by a '/'.Otherwise, it is relative to SSI_DIR.The file specified must exist either inSSI_ROOT or in one of its descendents. Example:    <!--#include file="/path/file" --> virtual - specify a document URL Use this tag to specify the URL of a virtualpath to a document. For flastmod, fsize, and include,virtual is always passed through the server's mappingdirectives. Example:    <!--#include virtual="/path/file" --> set - sets variables to be echoed Use this directive to set a variable that can beechoed later by only this file. Example:    <!--#set var="Variable 2" value="AnotherValue" --> Variables Server-side includes also allow you to echo a variable already set.While defining a directive, you can echo a string in themiddle of "value".For example:    <!--#include file="&filename;"--> If an unrecognized variable is found, nothing gets displayed. Server-side includes looks for the variable, echos wherethe variable is found, and proceeds with the function.You can have multiple variable references.When server-side includes encounter a variable referenceINSIDE a server-side include directive, it attempts to resolveit on the SERVER side.The following example escapes the & so that server-side includesdoes not recognize it as a variable. In the second line,the variable "&index;" is a server-side varilabe and is used toconstruct the variable name "var1". The variable ê is a clientside variable, so the & is escaped to create the value":frêd" or "fred" with a circumflex over the e.    <!--#set var="index" value="1" -->   <!--#set var="var&index;" value="fr\êd" -->   <!--#echo var="var1" --> The following characters that can be escaped.Note that escaped variables are preceded with a backslash (\).    \a     Alert(bell)   \b     Backspace   \f     Form feed (new page)   \n     New line   \r     Carriage return   \t     Horizontal tab   \v     Vertical tab   \'     Single quote mark   \"     Double quote mark   \?

Server: IBM-Secure-Export-ICS/v970115 BetaDate: Fri, 24 Jan 1997 21:41:54 GMTAccept-Ranges: bytesContent-Type: text/htmlContent-Length: 36085Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 02:01:26 GMT Internet Connection Secure Server Webmaster's Guide Rating Web sites and serving rated Web information Rating Web Sites and Information Using the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS),users of Internet applications, such as the World Wide Web, FTP, andGopher,can filter the material theyencounter and accept or reject the material based on its ratings.This filteringallows parents, businesses, schools, or discerning individualsto block the access to inappropriate and objectionable material.For the most up-to-date PICS information, seethe World Wide Web Consortium's PICS Web site(http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/).The specifications published at this Web site enable: Content providers (people who publishinformation on the Web) to rate and label their owndocuments. These can be HTML files, or other filesthat contain images, sound, or animations. Independent rating servicesto rate and label documents published by other Web sites andto distribute the labels to whomever requests them. Internet users (browsers and other clients) to request theselabels and determine how to handle rated and unrated information. The Internet Connection Secure Server makes it easy for you to store andserve the ratinglabels for the documents you publish. It also allows you toact as a rating service or label bureauby providing a means for you to maintain anddistribute rating labels for other Web sites. Who can rate Web sites Web sites can rate themselves or be rated by a third party, called arating service. A rating service evaluates Webcontent according to their own published criteriaand then distributes the labelsthrough a label bureau. Often a rating service actsas its own label bureau and distributes its own labels. Some rating services will alsogive you assistance in assessingand labeling your own site and documents.The World Wide Web Consortium publishes a list of PICS self-ratingservices athttp://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/selfrat.htm. The PICS specification does not determine who can or will act asa rating service.The World Wide Web Consortium publishes a list of PICS third-partyrating servicesat http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/pics.htm.In addition, anyone who wants tocan set up a rating service. You can set up such a service by: Deciding on a rating system Publishing the rating system Rating documents and creating the rating labels Establishing a Web site (URL) that clients can access toget your labels A rating service can choose any criteria on which to rate Web sites.While some mightrate Web sites for their violence or sexual content,others could choose to rate educational content, political correctness,or even how "cool" the site is. Also, a rating service canrate any and all Web sites that it wants to rate. Having your Web site and pages rated is often desirable.In fact, it may even be necessary for your Web siteto be rated in order to be viewed by a PICS-enabled client.Understanding how Web clients use the PICS labels and ratingswill help make this clear. How Web clients use PICS PICS-enabled clients allow the users to determine which ratingservices they want to use and, for each rating service, whichratings are acceptable and which are unacceptable. For example,a family might choose a rating service that rates documentsaccording to their sexual content. The rating service might have a lowrating for romance, a higher rating for passionate kissing,and yet higher ratings for more explicit sexual activity.The parents mightdecide that documents containing romance are the highest acceptablerating for their household.They would then configure their browser toreject all documents that are unrated or contain a higherrating from this rating service. In another example, the Hi-Tek Systems Corporation could label itsown documents with a "For Hi-Tek Use Only" and could equip all itsemployees with browsers configured to accept only documents withthat rating. There are several steps in this process: The client sends a request When a PICS-enabled client requests a document,it indicates in the requestwhich rating services are of interest.For example, assume these parents had configured theirbrowser to evaluate rating labelsfrom The Best rating service.When their children click a link to anHTML document, the browserrequest would also ask for the rating labels that were assigned tothe document by this rating service. The server sends a response Assume the PICS-enabled server has a copy ofthe labels the client is requesting.When the server receives the client's request, itsends the labels along with the requested document.However, if the server does not support PICS or does not have copies oflabels from that particular rating service,it sends the requested document anyway. The client checks the server response first The client first checks to see if the requested ratings labelsare imbedded in the document (in the meta information)or if they were sent along with the document.Some clients might acceptrating information that is imbedded in the file.Others might require a separate label from a registered ratingservice and a guarantee that it was created by that service.If the client successfully finds the labelinformation it wanted, it evaluatesthe rating and either displays the document or blocks it and displays amessage. The client contacts the rating service, if necessary If the client does not receive the label information with the requesteddocument from the server, it might send a subsequentrequest directly to the rating service askingfor the label information for that document.This requires a second connection, whichtakes longer and can discourage future visits to that site.The browser waits until the label information is returned beforeit displays any data. Faster response time is the main reason whyrating labels for a site should reside at the site. How the Internet Connection Secure Server helps you manage PICS labels Whether your Web server publishes Web documentsor you are a rating service and wantto provide the labels for other Web sites, the Internet Connection Secure Servercan help you manage PICS labels. PICS for Web site administrators As more browsers are configured to block access tounrated documents, it behooves you to have yourWeb site rated. And because it saves time when a browser can getthe ratings when it sends its initial request, itbehooves you to store the ratings for your pageson your own server.With the Internet Connection Secure Server's PICS support,you can manage the labels from one central file and serve themwith requested pages and documents.These labels can be: Self-assessed according to your own criteria If you are establishing your own rating service, you can rateyour own site according to your published criteria. Self-assessedaccording to the published criteria of a voluntary rating service Voluntary rating services, such as SafeSurf (http://www.safesurf.com)trust Web administrators to be honest inthe assessment of their own pages. Assessed by a third-party rating service according to the service'scriteria In this case, you might contact the rating service and requestthat they rate your Web site (if they have not already done so)and send you the label information.In fact, you might want to contact severalrating services to have your site rated for different subjectcriteria.If the third-party rating services have the Internet Connection Secure Server,this process can be simplified with an electronic request. See"How to request PICS label information". Once the ratings are established,Web administrators can do one of three things: Manually edit each of their HTML files, inserting the ratinginformation in the headers.See "Managing PICS labels for your Web site in each document". Use the label information to create PICS-compliant rating labels,store the labels in their file system, anduse the Internet Connection Secure Server'sPICS configuration file to manage and transmit them.See "Managing PICS labels for your Web site from a central file". Let the system automatically store the transmitted rating labelsand update your PICS configuration file for you. This can onlybe done when electronically requesting labels for a third-partyrating service that has the Internet Connection Secure Server.See "How to request PICS label information". Managing PICS labels for your Web site in each document You can editeach of your HTML files and embed PICS ratingsinformation in the meta element of the document header.This process is entirely manual and therefore time-consuming,error-prone, and difficult to maintain. It does not incorporateany of the security mechanisms (message digest, digital signature, etc.)that would guarantee the validityof the label, if this is important to the requesting client.The PICS specification (http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/)explains how you can embed rating informationin each document. It is not covered here. Managing PICS labels for your Web site from a central file The Internet Connection Secure Server'sPICS support allows you to store the rating labelsfor all the documents on your Web site and manage them froma central file. The labels are sentalong with your Web pages when a client requests them. In addition to the rating labels,you must also have a PICS-compliant rating system descriptionfile that describes the rating systemused to rate your documents. These are called RAT files, andrating services will provide them along with their labels. Once you have both the labels and the RAT file, you can use thePICS configuration fileto manage these labels from a central point.See "How to manage PICS labels from a central file". PICS for rating services and label bureaus Because many Web sites will want their pages rated, you havean opportunity to provide a service to a large number of Web sites. Content providers will contact your organization to request that yourate their Web site and provide them with the labels so thatthey will be able toserve the labels along with their Web documents themselves. Clients will connect to your server electronically torequest labels for pages they are attempting to view only whenthey cannot get the label information with therequested pages. The PICS configuration file provides you with the means to managethe labels for other Web sites and transmit them when requested. The PICS specifications allow anyoneto set up a rating service, define the criteria by which they rateWeb sites and documents, and then provide the ratings.With the Internet Connection Secure Server's PICS support,you canestablish your server as a rating serviceand maintain and distribute labels for other Web sites.You can ratedocuments at a Web site individually or use wildcard characters toquickly assign the same rating to all or part of a Web site's offerings.You will need to create these labels and your own RAT file.The RAT file is a PICS-compliant ratingfile that describes the rating systemused to rate documents.Once you have both the labels and the RAT file, you can use thePICS configuration fileto manage these labels from a central point.Your server will then be able to automatically send therating labels you have assigned when a client requests them.See "How to manage PICS labels from a central file". If a Web site that you have rated requests the labels for theirpages, you can also provide them with all their current ratings.Unfortunately,the World Wide Web Consortium has not yet defined a standardfor the label bureaus or rating services to send a Web siteall their label information.This means that the methodfor this exchange will have to be determined by therating services and the Web sites that ask for them. If the Web sites and the rating service (or label bureau) bothhave the Internet Connection Secure Server, they can electronically exchangerating labels and label entries for their PICS configuration file.In this case, the rating labels will be automatically stored on theserver and the PICS configuration file will be updated so that itcan transmit the labels with the requested documents. If not, we are assuming that the rating services will send afile of all the required label information to the Web siteadministrators.Once the administrators receive this information,they will use whatever method is available on their serverto create PICS rating labels and enable their server to transmit themwith the requested documents. How to manage PICS labels from a central file Managing PICS labels on the Internet Connection Secure Serverrequires three things: A rating (RAT) file that describes the ratings If you are starting your own rating service or label bureau,you will need to create a file that describes your rating system.This file must be in themachine-readable format detailed in the PICStechnical specifications and it shouldhave the .rat extension.If you are getting your labels from a third-partyrating service, you must also get a copy of their RAT file. The rating labels themselves Whether you are maintaining labels for your own Web site or, as a ratingservice, maintaining labels for other sites, you will need to store thelabels in your server's file system, one label per file.Rating services will rate documents on the Internet and createthe rating label files themselves. Web sites will either rate theirown site and create the label files or they will request the ratinglabels from third-party rating services. If you are getting your rating labelsfrom a third-party rating service thatalso has the Internet Connection Secure Server, you can request the labelselectronically and they will be sent and stored directly on yoursystem for you. Otherwise, you may need to do some editing of theinformation you receive before creating rating labels to store in yourfile system. When creating PICS rating labels, be sure to follow the PICSspecification.See "How to create PICS labels".We recommend you use .lbl for theextension on your label files and we have includeda predefined AddType directive in the configuration filefor this extension. The PICS configuration file This file provides a mapping between the actual rating labelsand the documents they rate. It enables the server to quickly respondto HTTP, FTP, and Gopher requests.If you are getting your rating labelsfrom a third-party rating service thatalso has the Internet Connection Secure Server, your PICS configuration filewill automatically be updated with entries for the labels you receive.If you are arating service or if you receive rating labels fromthird-party rating services that have a different server, youwill need to maintain the PICS configuration file yourself.You can use the online Configuration and Administration Formsto update and maintain this file or you can edit it manually.See "How to update the PICS configuration file". Storing the PICS files on your server You will need tostore both the RAT file and rating labels in files on your server. The RAT file should be available froma rating service's Web site.The rating labels must be stored one label per file. You can use any directories, subdirectories, and file names thatmake sense at your site and for your implementation. We recommend thatWeb siteshave a separate directory or subdirectory for each third-partyrating service that they use. This is requiredfor automatic updates when requestinglabels from rating services that have the Internet Connection Secure Server. Our examplesuse a file extension of .lbl on each rating label file.This is also the extension for any label files the Internet Connection Secure Servertransmits electronically. Managing PICS labels for your own Web site Follow these steps to store rating labels in your file systemandconfigure your server so it sends these labels when clientsrequest them. Obtain a copy of the RAT file from therating services you want to use and store it in your file system onyour server. If you are getting rating labels from a third-party rating servicethat has the Internet Connection Secure Server: Use theonline Configuration and Administration Forms to request thelabels and the entries for your PICS configuration file electronically.When you receive these files, your server will automatically be updatedfor you.See "How to request PICS label information". If you are notgetting rating labels from a third-party rating servicethat has the Internet Connection Secure Server: Obtain the ratings from the third-party rating serviceor rate your own documents. Create labelsaccording to the format published in the PICS specification.See "How to create PICS labels". Store the labels in separate files, one label per file,in your server's file system. Tell your server which documents are rated,where the actual rating labels can be found, and which rating serviceprovided the labels.You do this by adding entries to the PICSconfiguration file to associate the rated documents with theirlabel files.You can use the online Configuration and Administration Forms toupdate and maintain this file or you can edit it manually.See "How to update the PICS configuration file". Starting a PICS rating service and label bureau Follow these steps to configure your server as a PICS rating service,store rating labels for other Web sites, and serve them in response toclient requests. Define a rating system and create your own RAT file.Check the World Wide Web Consortium's PICS specification(http://www.w3.org.PICS/services.html)for instructions on how to do this. It includes thesyntax for the machine-readable format of the RAT file. Establish two URLs for your rating service. One URL identifies yourservice by name. Include this URL in yourRAT file. The other URL is for label requests.You must direct all the label requests that come to your server tothis specific URL. The PICSspecification has no requirements regarding these URLs;you may choose any URL that you like. Add the Service directive to inform the server that youare a PICS service and specify where to direct the PICS rating labelrequests. For example:      Service /Ratings INTERNAL:PICS-Ratings Replace /Ratings with the path and file name portion of theURL you will use for label requests. For example, if you publishthe URL http://www.coolratings.com/CoolSite, you would onlyinlcude /CoolSite in the Service directive. Rate documents and Web sites according to your establishedrating system. Create rating labels for these documents and sitesand store them in your server's file system, one label per file.See "How to create PICS labels". Tell your server which documents you have rated, what host servesthem, and where the labels can be found in your file system.You do this by putting entries in the PICSconfiguration file that associates the rated documents and theirspecific label files.You can use the online Configuration and Administration Forms toupdate and maintain this file or you can edit it manually.See "How to update the PICS configuration file". Make the URL you will use for label requests known to the public. Notify all your subscribers and users to send their requests forrating labels to this URL.PICS-enabled clients and servers will use this URL tocontact your server for labels. How to create PICS labels In general, a label file is a text file containing a label.Carefully review the formatof labels given by thePICS Rating Services and Rating Systems specification(http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/services.html). PICS label extensions The Internet Connection Secure Server has added extensions to this formatto save you repetitious data entry and to allow you to add comments. Comments for your own use You can insert comments for your own useinto label files. Begin these comment lines with '#'.Lines beginningwith '#' are not sent to clients.This type of comment is anaddition to the "comment" statements usedinside labels."Comment"statements in labels are sent to clients. Additional variables The Internet Connection Secure Serverhas also defined some variables that you can insertin label files. %%URL%% The current URL will be substituted for this variable.When the server receives a request for a rating label thatcontains for %%URL%%, it replacesthis variable with the correct for statementbefore sending the label. Note: Do not use this variable on generic labels (those that apply tomultiple files). %%SERVICENAME%% The service name requested will be substituted for this variable.When the server receives a request for a rating label thatcontains for %%SERVICENAME%%, it replacesthis variable with the correct service statementbefore sending the label. How to request PICS label information If a third-party rating service hasthe Internet Connection Secure Server, you can electronically request ratinglabels for all the documents on your Web site that thethird-party service has rated.As a response to that request, you will receive both rating labels andPICS configuration file label entries. Both types of informationwill automatically bestored on your server. To electronically request rating label andentries for automatic update: From the default home page (Frntpage.html), selectConfiguration and Administration Forms.When prompted, enter the administration user ID andpassword you have set up. Select PICS Services Configuration.This displays the PICS Services Configuration main page. Select Request Label Entries from Third-Party Rating Service. Note: The third-party rating service must have the Internet Connection Secure Serverfor you to use this feature.If not, the request fails. If the third-party rating service has rated your Web site, it willreturn both the rating labels and label entries for your PICSconfiguration file. The rating labels will be stored in the directoryyou specified on the form. The label entries will automatically beadded to your PICS configuration file. If the third-party rating service has not rated your Web site, it willreturn a response indicating that it does not have the informationyou requested. How to update the PICS configuration file The Internet Connection Secure Server provides the PICS configuration filefor you to manage PICS labels froma central point and serve them when clients request them.You can use the online Configuration and Administration formsto add, modify, and delete the label entries in thePICS configuration file, or you can edit the file andmaintain the data manually. Using the online Configuration and Administration forms From the default home page (Frntpage.html), selectConfiguration and Administration Forms.When prompted, enter the administration user ID andpassword you have set up. Select PICS Services Configuration.This displays the PICS Services Configuration main page. If you are maintaining labels for your own Web site: Select Register Third-Party Rating Services to registerthe services that have sent you labels and identify their RAT files.With the PICS example files, initiallyyou will have one entry for the The Best rating service,http://www.coolness.raleigh.ibm.com/ratings/V1.html,along with its RAT file, coolness.rat. Select Maintain PICS Label Entries for Your Web Siteto view, add, modify,or delete the entries that associate specific documents or pages withyour rating labels. If you are maintaining labels for other Web sites: Ensure that you have your RAT file stored in your file system. Select Register Your Own Rating Service to registerthe location of your RAT file on your server. Select Maintain PICS Label Entries for Other Web Sitesto view, add, modify, or delete the entries that associatespecific documents or pages with your rating labels. Editing the PICS configuration file manually The exact name and location of the PICS configuration file isETC/ICS_PICS.CNF(where ETC represents the directory specified by theETC environment variable in the CONFIG.SYS configuration file). The configuration file consists of a list of paragraphs.There are three types of paragraphs. LabelsFor Specifies the ratings givenby a particular rating service for documents on a given Web server.For example, one LabelsFor paragraph could cover ratings accordingto the RSAC rating system for documents on the local server,while another paragraph could cover ratings according to theThe Best rating system for documents on the local server. DefineService Lists local label files associated with a third-party rating service. DefineLBService Lists local label files associated with yourown label bureau or rating service. Note: The PICS configuration file associatesWeb documents with files containing labels. The labels themselvesare stored in separate files, not in the PICS configuration file. PICS configuration file syntax LabelsFor The first line of the paragraph consists of the keywordLabelsFor,the name of the server on which the rated documents are found,the name of the rating service, and an opening brace.The body of the paragraph specifies labels for sets of documents.Each paragraph ends with a closing brace. LabelsFor servername servicename {    /WebPath1/document1    /path/LabelFile1    /WebPath2/document2    /path/LabelFile2    ...and so on...} servername This can be the keyword LOCALto indicate documents on this server,or it can be a full URL if documents on remote servers are being rated.Only servers acting as label bureaus (rating services)will need to use ahostname other than LOCAL.When your server is providing labels forthe documents it hosts, you should always use the keywordLOCAL for the hostname.Note that you must specify the protocol and hostname withouta trailing slash; thus, http://www.xyz.comis acceptable as a hostname on a LabelsFor line, buthttp://www.xyz.com/ is not. servicename The full URL where clients will send their label requests. /WebPath/document The Web path and name of the document being rated.This is the path aWeb client would use when requesting the document. For example,if the Naughty/Image1.gif was on the server www.rated.xyz.com,then a Web client would requesthttp://www.rated.xyz.com/Naughty/Image1.gif. Note: You can use wildcard characters (*)to rate multiple documents at once.See "Using wildcards in the PICS configuration file". /path/LabelFile The fully qualified name of the label file in yourfile system.(This includes the drive name.) You cannot use wildcard characters in file names. A special keyword, NOTLABELED,can be used in placeof a label file name. This indicates that the given file(s) cannot belabeled; it serves as a shorthand way of creating a label file thatcontains a "not-rated" label. In the example above, a not-ratederror message will be returned to anyclients who request a rating for the file /Unknown.html. For example,an actual LabelsFor paragraph might look like this: LabelsFor LOCAL http://www.rsac.org/ratingsv01.html {    /Naughty/Image1.gif  d:\www\pics\labels\AdultsOnly.lbl    /Clean/*.html        d:\www\pics\labels\AllAges.lbl    /Unknown.html        NOTLABELED} DefineService The first line of the paragraph consists of the keywordDefineService,the rating service URL, the quoted name of the rating service,the location and name of the service's RAT file,and an opening brace.The body of the paragraph liststhe label files associated with this service,specifying each one with the keyword LABELFILE.Each paragraph ends with a closing brace. DefineService servicename "name-of-service" ratingfile {     LABELFILE  /path/LabelFile1 "description"     LABELFILE  /path/LabelFile2 "description"     ...and so on...} servicename The name (URL) of the rating service. name-of-service The name (text) of the rating service, in quotes. ratingfile The fully qualified name of the service's RAT file in yourfile system.(This includes the drive name.) /path/LabelFile The fully qualified name of the label file in yourfile system.(This includes the drive name.) description A text description of the label, in quotes. For example,an actual DefineService paragraph might look like this: DefineService http://www.abc.org/rate.html "The ABC's of Ratings" d:\www\pics\rat\abc.rat {    LABELFILE  d:\www\pics\labels\AdultsOnly.lbl  "rated XXX"    LABELFILE  d:\www\pics\labels\AllAges.lbl     "rated GGG"} DefineLBService This paragraph has the same syntax and format as theDefineService paragraph. The only difference is thatit uses the DefineLBService keyword and the RAT file andlabels that it lists are for your own label bureau and rating service. Using wildcards in the PICS configuration file You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard only in the LabelsForparagraphs of the PICS configuration file.When using wildcards, remember thatthe order of entries within a paragraph is important.For each paragraph, the Internet Connection Secure Serverbreaks the list of rated documents into two parts: those thatcontain wildcards, and those that do not contain wildcards. When the server looks for labels fora document, it will first try to find the document in the "no-wildcards"list. Order is unimportant here. Without wildcards, eachentry in the list refers to exactly one document. If the server cannot find a match in the "no-wildcards" list,it will try to match the document nameagainst the entries that contain wildcards.Order is important The servertries to match the requested document against the wildcard entriesin the order in which they appear in the configuration fileand will use the first entry that matches. For example, if you want an entry thatgives /* as the WebPath/document, serving as a catchallfor documents that don't have another rating, then make thisthe last entry in the paragraph.

Limiting access to individual files Using server group files Using Access Control List (ACL) files Protection example (without SSL client authentication) Protection example (with SSL client authentication) For information on providing security for server dataon the Internet,see "Making your communications secure". Protection methods You announce to the world that you want peopleto come look at the documents on your server.But once you publicize your server to the Internet, you riskattracting unwanted attention to the system on which it runs.Unauthorized people may try to guess passwords, update files,execute files, or tap into confidential data.Part of the attraction of the World Wide Web is its openness.However, the Web is open to both positive use and abuse. There are several ways that you can protectyour system: Place a server meant for public access in a networkthat is separate from your local or internal network. Disable Telnet, rlogin, and finger clients on the systemthat is running the server.In particular, consider disabling Telnet and TN3270. Use packet filtering and firewalls. Packet filtering allows youto definewhere data can come from and where it can go.You can configure your system to rejectcertain source/destination combinations. A firewall providesa way to separate an internal networkfrom a publicly accessible network, such as the Internet.The firewall can be a group of computers or a single computerthat acts as a gateway in both directions, regulating andtracking the traffic passing through it.An example of firewall software is theIBM Internet Connection Secured Network Gateway. You can configure your server as a proxy server through a firewall.This way, internal users can get out to the Internet,but outside Internet travelers cannot get in.Using a proxy server also ensures that any access to theInternet by internal browsers is done anonymously.Because all of the requests to the Internet are made by the proxyserver on the part of the internal user, the remote host does nothave access to the name of the specific host that is on the insideof the firewall.For information on configuring your server as a caching proxy,see "Running your server as a proxy".For information on using your server on a firewall machine, seethe documentation for your firewall software. Protect access to CGI scripts. Using CGI scripts on a Web servercan create a security exposure.If you use CGI scripts, you need to protect themby controlling who has access to them. It is possible to write CGI scriptsthat display all environment variables.At times these variables may include sensitive datasuch as user IDs and passwords.So you must be careful about displaying environment variablesin your CGI scripts and control access to your CGI scripts.Make sure you know what a CGI program doesbefore you make it available on your server. Protect user directories on your server. By allowing local users to have Web pages,you may be creating a security exposure.You need to carefully control access to the pageson local users' machines.You may choose not to allow any local usersto have executable CGI scripts.For more information, see "User directories". The following sections describe how you control who has accessto the various files you keep on your server.The steps first tell you how to set up protectionby editing the configuration file.When appropriate, the steps tell you which Configuration andAdministration forms you can use to perform the same task. Step 1. Activating protection The first step to controlling access to yourserver's resources is to activate protection.You activate protection based on the contentof requests that clients send to your server. This document refers to a request asthe part of a full URL that follows your server host name.For example, if your server is named fine.feathers.comand a requester enters the following URL on a browser: http://fine.feathers.com/waterfowl/schedule.html The request your server receives is:/waterfowl/schedule.html You can use Protect directives to specifywhich requests should activate protection.Each Protect directive has a request template.The server activates protection when it receives a requestthat matches a request template on a Protect directive.The Protect directive also either identifiesor contains the protection setup to be used. See "Access control - Set up access control for the server" for details on how to use Protect directives. You can also use the Configuration and Administration formsto specify which requests should activate protection.From the Configuration and Administration forms page,click Document protection. Step 2. Passing the requests Besides activating protection for the requests, you must alsotell your server which requests to accept for processing. Use Pass and Exec directives to specifywhich requests you want your server to accept.The Pass and Exec directives map requests to actual directoriesand files on your server (the information you are protecting). Like the Protect directive, each Pass and Exec directivecontains a request template.After the server checks to see if a request activates protection,it goes through its list of Pass and Exec directivesto determine if it should accept the request.If the request matches a request template on a Pass or Exec directive,the server accepts the request.If protection was activated, the server uses the protection setupto determine whether it should complete the request. So for protection to work properly, you must ensurethat your Pass and Exec directives accept the requeststhat your Protect directives activate protection for.Use Pass directives to accept document requests.Use Exec directives to accept CGI program requests. See "Resource mapping - Redirect URLs" for details on howto use the Pass and Exec directives. Attention: You must put your Protect directivesbefore any Pass or Exec directives in your configuration file. You can also use the Configuration and Administration formsto specify which requests to accept and how to map themto your actual resources.From the Configuration and Administration forms page,click Request Routing. Step 3. Deciding what type of protection to use You can use two types of protection to control accessto your resources through the server: User name and password protection Address template protection. You can use one type of protection by itself or both together.You can use either or both types of protection inprotection setups and Access Control List (ACL) files.It is helpful to understand these two different types of protectionbefore you create your protection setups or ACL files. The following two sections describe each type of protection.Following those two sections is a section describinghow the server processes requests based on the type ofprotection being used. User name and password protection With this type of protection, you create user names that you wantrequesters to use to access your protected resources.You define each user name and assign it a password in a password file. After you define a user name, you can use itwithin protection setups and ACL files to specifywhich user names are valid for different types of requests. When the server receives a request that activatesthis type of protection, the server prompts the requesterfor a user name and password.In order for the request to complete, the requester must return auser name and password that meet the following criteria: The user name must be defined in the protection setup or ACL fileas valid for the type of request being made. The password must match the one definedfor the user name in the password file. Address template protection With this type of protection, you use address templates to specifyvalid requester addresses for the different types of requests.You can use address templates in protection setups and ACL files. When the server receives a request that activates this type ofprotection, it compares the address of the requester to the templatesto determine if the request comes from a valid address.The server can use either the IP address of the requester(for example, 9.67.97.103) or the host name of the requester(for example, any.host.name.com) when comparing against the templates. Note: In order to compare the requester host names against addresstemplates, you must set the DNS-Lookup directive to On.If the DNS-Lookup directive is set to Off(the default), your server can compare only the IP addressof the requester to the address templates.See "DNS-Lookup - Specify whether you want to look up host names of clients". How the server processes requests Following is a description of how the serverprocesses a request that has already activated protectionand been accepted by a Pass or Exec directive.The description assumes that all protection is defined in theprotection setup (no ACL file exists on the protected directory). Read over the description now to help you decidewhat type of protection you want to use.You may want to read again in more detail aftergoing through the steps for creating protection setups. Based on the HTTP method of the request, the server refers to theappropriate mask subdirective (DeleteMask, GetMask, Mask,PostMask, or PutMask) in the protection setup.The mask subdirective specifies valid user names,groups, or address templates. If any items on the mask subdirective use only addresstemplate protection, the server compares the addressof the requester against the address templates. Items that use only address template protectionstart with either @, Anybody@,Anyone@, or Anonymous@,followed by one or more address templates.Group names on the subdirective might also containitems that use only address template protection. If there is a match, the server completes the requestwithoutprompting for a user name or password. If there is not a match or no itemsuse address template protection only,the process continues with the next step. If any items on the mask subdirective areuser names or group names, the server promptsthe requester for a user name and password. The server checks the user name sent bythe requester against the valid user names.Valid user names are either the individual user names onthe mask subdirective or user names defined as being partof a group that is on the mask subdirective. If there is a match, the process continues with the next step. If there is not a match, the process ends and the server returnsa message to the requester saying that authorization failed. If the user name sent by the requester is also associatedwith an address template, the server checksthe address of the requester against the template.The mask subdirectives and group files use the at signcharacter (@) to associate user names or group nameswith address templates. If there is a match, the process continues with the next step. If there is not a match, the process ends and the server returnsa message to the requester saying that authorization failed. The server checks the user name sent by the requester against theuser names in the password file that the protection setup points to. If there is a match, the process continues with the next step. Note: It is important to note that the password file must contain anentry for the user name that the requester sends to the server.You make up the user names that are in the password file.The names themselves do not have any relationto the addresses of the requesters. If there is not a match, the process ends and the server returnsa message to the requester saying that authorization failed. The server checks the password sent by the requester againstthe password defined for the user name in the password file.Each user name in the password file has one valid password. If there is a match, the server completes the request. If there is not a match, the process ends and the server returnsa message to the requester saying that authorization failed. Step 4. Creating protection setups When a Protect directive activates protection for a request,it also either identifies the protection setup to useor defines the protection setup as part of the directive.A protection setup is a group of protection subdirectives.The subdirectives work together to define how the servershould control access to the resources being protected.You can create protection setups three different ways: You can create protection setups within the configuration fileas part of Protection, Protect, or DefProt directives. When you create a protection setup on a Protection directive,you give the setup a label that you can point to later fromProtect and DefProt directives. When you create a protection setup on a DefProt orProtect directive, the protection setup is used only forthat directive.The setup cannot be pointed to by other DefProt or Protect directives.This type of protection setup is called an in-line protectionsetup. You indicate you are including a protection setupas part of a Protection, Protect, or DefProt directiveby making the last character on the line that containsthe directive a left brace character ({).On each following line you put one protection subdirective and its value.You indicate the end of the protection setup by puttinga right brace character (}) by itselfon the line following the last protection subdirective.You cannot use comments within the protection setup. See "Access control - Set up access control for the server" for more information and examplesof creating protection setups in the configuration file. You can create separate protection setup files that you can thenpoint to from Protect and DefProt directives.A protection setup file is a plain text file.Within the file, each line contains oneprotection subdirective and the value for that subdirective. You can use the Configuration and Administration formsto create protection setups within the configuration file.From the Configuration and Administration forms page,click Document protection andspecify you want to create an in-line protection setup.Or, from the Configuration and Administration forms page,click Protection setups to add, change,or delete named protection setups. Within the protection setup, the protection subdirectivescontrol access to the directory or files being protected.The following sections describe how to use eachof the protection subdirectives. Identifying the protection setup to requesters For user name and password protection,use the ServerID subdirective to specify a name you wantto use to identify the protection setup to requesters.The name does not need to be a real machine name. When the server sends a requester a prompt for user name and password,it also includes the name you specify on ServerID.Most browsers display this name with the prompt.Because different protection setups can use differentpassword files, having a name associated with the protection setupcan help the requester decide which user name and password to send back.Many browsers also attempt to automatically send a user name andpassword if the requester has previously responded to a promptfrom a protection setup with the same name. If the protection setup is using address template protection only,you do not need to use the ServerID subdirective. If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms,you specify this name in the Server identifier fieldon the Protection Setup form. Example:    ServerID restricted Specifying the type of authentication The AuthType subdirective specifies the type of authenticationto use when a client sends a password to the server.For user name and password protection, you must usethe AuthType subdirective with a value of Basic.With basic authentication, passwords are sentto the server as plain text.They are encoded, but not encrypted. If the protection setup is using addresstemplate protection only, you do not need to use theAuthType subdirective. Example:    AuthType Basic Pointing to the password file For user name and password protection, use the PasswdFilesubdirective to specify the path and name of the password filethat you want the protection setup to use. Each password file contains a list of user names and passwords.Each user name has one valid password defined for it.The requester must send back a user name and password that exactlymatches a user name and password in the password file. If the protection setup is using addresstemplate protection only, you do not need to use thePasswdFile subdirective. If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, youspecify the file path and name of the password file in thePassword file field on the Protection Setup form. You create and maintain password files using the htadm command.See "htadm command" for information onhow to create and maintain password files. Note: The user names in the password file do not haveany relation to the addresses of the requesters.You make up the user names and passwords. Example:    PasswdFile  c:\WWW\restrict.password Pointing to a server group file If you want to use group names in the protection setup,use the GroupFile subdirective to specify the path andfile name of the server group file that containsthe group definitions you want to use.The groups defined within the server group file can then be used by: Any mask subdirectives that are part of the protection setup.(The mask subdirectives are DeleteMask, GetMask, Mask,PostMask, and PutMask.) Any ACL file on a directory that is protected by the protection setup. See "Using server group files" more information about server group files. If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, youspecify the file path and name in the Group filefield on the Protection Setup form. Example:    GroupFile d:\docs\WWW\restrict.group Specifying valid user names, groups, and addresses Use the mask subdirectives to specify valid user names,groups, and address templates for different types of requests.The mask subdirectives protect the entire directorythat the request is mapped to. Each request to your server contains an HTTP methodfield that identifies the type of request being made.See "Methods - Set method acceptance" for a description of the HTTP methodssupported by the server.Choose which mask subdirectives to use based on thetypes of requests you want to authorize.For a protection setup to be valid, it must contain at leastone of the following mask subdirectives: DeleteMask - to authorize DELETE requests. GetMask - to authorize GET requests. PostMask - to authorize POST requests.(Most HTML forms use the POST method.) PutMask - to authorize PUT requests. Mask - to authorize requests using any enabled methodsnot covered by the other mask subdirectives.Other mask subdirectives take precedence overthe Mask subdirective if both are present in the protection setup.For example, if a protection setup contains a DeleteMasksubdirective and a Mask subdirective, DELETE requests are coveredby the DeleteMask subdirective and all other requests are covered bythe Mask subdirective. Rules for specifying user names, group names, and address templates Following are explanations and examples of the different waysyou can specify user names, group names, and address templateson mask subdirectives.The same rules also apply for specifying user names, groupnames, and address templates in server group files and ACL files.If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, thesame rules apply to the values you can enter in theGet, Put, Post, Delete, and All fields on the Protection Setup form. You can specify a user name without an address template.The user name must be defined in the protection setup password file.If the requester returns the user name with the correct password,the server completes the request.    GetMask  swandude You can specify an address template without a user name.If the requester address matches the address template,the server completes the request without prompting the requesterfor a user name and password. The address template can be based on either IP address or host name.Use the asterisk character (*) as a wildcardin any part or the template.To indicate you want to use address template protection only,precede the template with one of the following:@,Anybody@, Anyone@, or Anonymous@.    GetMask    Anybody@123.45.2.*   PostMask   @96.*.*.*   DeleteMask Anonymous@walden.pond.*.* Note: In order to compare the requester host names against addresstemplates, you must set the DNS-Lookup directive to On.If the DNS-Lookup directive is set to Off(the default), your server can compare only the IP addressof the requester to the address templates.See "DNS-Lookup - Specify whether you want to look up host names of clients". You can specify a user name with an address template.The user name must be defined in the protection setup password file.Separate the user name from the address templatewith the at sign character (@).If the requester returns the user name with the correct password andthe requester address matches the address template,the server completes the request.    GetMask   webfoot@96.96.*.*   PostMask  billface@*.ibm.com You can use the value All or Userswith or without an address templateto represent all user names defined in the password file.If the requester returns any user name and password definedin the protection setup password file, andthe requester address matches any address templates,the server completes the request.   GetMask    All  PostMask   All@(96.*.*.*,*.ibm.com,123.45.2.*) You can specify a group name that is defined in theserver group file specified on the GroupFile subdirective(see "Using server group files"). A group name can include user names, other group names,and address templates in any of the same formatsallowed on masking subdirectives.To be valid, any user names included in the group namemust also be defined in the protection setup password file.If the requester returns a valid user nameand password and any address templates are matched,the server completes the request.    GetMask   ducks   PostMask  geese You can use the values Anybody, Anyone,or Anonymous without an address template orwith an address template of (*)to indicate you do not want to useany protection for requests covered by the subdirective.The server completes requests without prompting for a user name andpassword and without checking the address of the requester.    GetMask  Anybody   PutMask  Anyone@(*) You can specify multiple items on each subdirective.Separate each item with a comma.The comma is treated as a logical or.    GetMask   swandude@96.96.*.*,geese,ducks,Anyone@walden.pond.*.* You can continue a list of user and group names onto a new line byending the previous line with a comma.    GetMask   swandude@96.96.*.*,webfoot@water.fowl.com,             geese,billface You can use parentheses to keep user names and group names togetheror address templates together.    GetMask   (gooduser,webfoot)@96.96.*.*,             billface@(water.fowl.com,123.45.2.*),             (goosegg,bagel,elnada)@(98.*,146.*) If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, youspecify user names, groups and address templates in theDelete mask, Get mask, Post mask,and Put mask fields on the Protection Setup form.You use the same rules as explained above. Creating protection setups for SSL client authentication "Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)" describes how to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)with a secure server. If you set up your server for SSL clientauthentication, the server requests a certificate from any clientmaking an https request.The server establishes a secure connection whether or not theclient has a valid certificate. You can restrict who can access documents byusing password files and/or user or group authentication in protectionsetups as described in "Protecting your server".You can further restrict who can access documents by codingSSL client authentication parameters on protection setups,ACL files, or both.(Coding SSL client authentication parameters on protectionsetups is described in this topic; coding them in ACL files isdescribed in "Step 5. Limiting access to individual files".)For SSL client authentication parameters, youcan specify all or part of the Distinguished Name (DN) of a clientor of the certification authority (CA) who issued the client'scertificate.You can also specify DN information for multiple clients or CAs ona given subdirective. When you use SSL client authentication parameters,the server first compares any DN information in a protection setup andthen compares any DN information in an ACL filewith the DN information in the client's certificate.If the DN information matches, the server serves the document. You can use the Protection Setup Configuration and Administrationform to specify the SSL clientauthentication parameters or you can specify the followingon the Protection or Protect directive: All or any of the following parameters that make up aclient's Distinguished Name in the client's certificate: CommonName - the client's common name Country - the country in which the client resides Locality - the locality in which the client resides StateOrProvince - the state or province in which the clientresides Organization - the organization of the client OrgUnit - the organizational unit of the client All or any of the following subdirectives that make up theCA's Distinguished Name in the client's certificate: IssuerCommonName - the CA's common name IssuerCountry - the country in which the CA resides IssuerLocality - the locality in which the CA resides IssuerStateOrProvince - the state or province in which the CAresides IssuerOrganization - the organization of the CA IssuerOrgUnit - the organizational unit of the CA Examples: Protect  /topsecret/*   {CommonName="Dr Sheila A. Jones"Organization="RTP Quick Care Center"} In the above example of an inline Protect directive,SSL client authentication must be set up, and the client must be makingan https request and have a certificate with a commonname of Dr Sheila A. Jones and an organization ofRTP Quick Care Center to access the document. Protect  /topsecret/*   {CommonName="Dr Sheila A. Jones","Dr Harry S. Smith"Organization="RTP Quick Care Center"} In the above example, SSL client authentication must be set up,and the client must be making an https request andhave a certificate with a common name ofDr Sheila A. Jones or Dr Harry S. Smith andan organization of RTP Quick Care Center to access the document. Hints and tips for coding SSL client authentication parameters Specify any or all of a client or CA's DN. Specify the DN information for multiple clients orCAs on a given parameter. The DN information should beseparated by a comma (as shown in the above example). Enclose DN information that contains blanks orspecial characters indouble quotes (as shown in the above example). Make sure the DN information matches the DN informationin the client's certificate.This information is case sensitive and must have the samepunctuation. Do not use wildcard characters for any of the parameters. Step 5. Limiting access to individual files Perform this step only if you want to limit access to specificfiles on directories already protected by the protection setup. To limit access to specific files on a protected directory, youcreate an Access Control List (ACL) file and place it on the directory.The ACL file must be named .www_acl. Normally, the mask subdirectives in the protection setupdefine the first level of access control and then theACL file further limits access.However, if you want all control to come from the ACL file,use the ACLOverride subdirective with a value of Onin the protection setup.This causes the mask subdirectivesin the protection setup to be ignored.All access control is passed to the ACL file. See "Using Access Control List (ACL) files" for more information about ACL files. If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms,you can specify that you want the protection setup to giveall control to ACL files bychecking the Allow ACL file to override masks boxon the Protection Setup form. Using server group files You can use group files to classify users into groups. Protection setups can point to a server group file.The protection setup can then use the groups definedin the server group file on mask subdirectives.If a protected directory contains an ACL file,the rules in the ACL file can also usethe groups defined in the server group file. You can create as many server group files as you need.Create each in a separate text file.Within the server group file, each line contains a group definitionusing the following format:    groupname : user1[,user2[,user3...]] groupname Any name you want to use to identify the group you are defining.This name can be used on: Mask subdirectives within protection setupsthat point to the server group file.(The mask subdirectives are DeleteMask, GetMask, Mask,PostMask, and PutMask.) Access rules within ACL files on directories that are protectedwith a protection setup that points to the server group file. Subsequent group definitions within the same server group file. user1[,user2[,user3...]] This can actually be any combination of user names,group names, and address templates.Separate each item with a comma. For user names to be valid, they must be defined in thepassword file that the protection setup points to.Group names must be defined on previousgroup definition statements in the same group file. Generally, the items you specify have to follow the same rulesdescribed under "Rules for specifying user names, group names, and address templates". Examples:    ducks  : (webfoot,billface)@96.96.3.1,swandude   geese  : goosegg,bagel@(walden.pond.*.*,123.*.*.*)   flock  : ducks,geese   webbed : All@water.fowl.* In the above example, notice that oncethe groups named ducks and geese are defined,they can be included as part of the group named flock. Using Access Control List (ACL) files This section describes how to "hand code" ACL files.You can also create ACL files using theConfiguration and Administration forms.From the Configuration and Administration forms page, clickAccess Control Lists. You can use ACL files to limit accessto specific files on a protected directory. Each protected directory can have only one ACL file.The ACL file must be named .www_acl andbe present on the protected directory. Normally, the mask subdirectives in the protection setupdefine the first level of access control and then theACL file further limits access to individual files.However, if you want all control to come from the ACL file,use the ACLOverride subdirective with a value of Onin the protection setup.This causes the mask subdirectives in the protection setupto be ignored when a protected directory contains an ACL file. Within the ACL file, each line contains a rule limiting access basedon file name, HTTP method, and authorized users, groups, or addresses.The server processes the rules in the ACL filefrom top to bottom.The server compares the three elements of each rule to the requestuntil a match is found or until the end of the file is reached. The format for rules in ACL files is:    file : method : [SSLauth,] user file A file name or a template for the files you wantto protect with this rule.Each file template can contain one asterisk (*) wildcard character. The server denies any requests for filesthat are not listed or covered by a template. method ormethod1[,method2[,method3...]] An HTTP method or list of methods, separated by commas.The methods define what kind of requests the authorized users areallowed to make for the protected files.Any method you specify must also be enabled.See "Methods - Set method acceptance" for an explanation ofthe HTTP methods supported by the server and how to enable them. SSLauth If you have implemented SSL client authentication, you can codeACL files that specify any or all parts of the DistinguishedName of a client or the CA who issued the client's certificate.You can also include more than one client or CA parameter ina given ACL.The server requests the client's certificate.The server compares the DN information in the certificate firstto DN information in protection setups and then to DN information inACL files.If the DN information matches, the server returns the document. The ACL can specify any of all of the following parts of the Client's Distinguished Name in the client's certificate: !CommonName - the client's common name !Country - the country in which the client resides !Locality - the locality in which the client resides !StateOrProvince - the state or province in which the clientresides !Organization - the organization of the client !OrgUnit - the organizational unit of the client CA's Distinguished Name in the client's certificate: !IssuerCommonName - the CA's common name !IssuerCountry - the country in which the CA resides !IssuerLocality - the locality in which the CA resides !IssuerStateOrProvince - the state or province in which the CAresides !IssuerOrganization - the organization of the CA !IssuerOrgUnit - the organizational unit of the CA user oruser1[,user2[,user3...]] This can actually be any combinationof user names, group names, and IP address templates.Separate each item with a comma. For user names to be valid, they must be defined in thepassword file that the protection setup points to.Group names must be defined in the servergroup file the protection setup points to. The items you specify have to follow the same rulesas you use to specify user names, group names,and address templates on mask subdirectives.See "Rules for specifying user names, group names, and address templates". Examples:    *             : GET             :  All   *.html        : GET,POST        :  geese   golden.*      : GET,POST        :  geese,@bean.stalk.*   welcome.html  : GET,POST,DELETE :  webfoot@123.34.14.2 In the above example, any valid user name and passwordcan be used to GET any file on the directory.User names defined for the group geese can be usedto POST to any HTML files.From IP address 123.34.14.2, the user name webfootcan be used to DELETE the welcome.html file. Example patientA.html : GET : !CommonName="Dr Shelia A. Jones" 9.67.*.* In the above example, SSL client authentication must be set up, andthe client must be making an https request from an IPaddress beginning with 9.67 and have a client certificate with acommon name of Dr Shelia A. Jones to access the patientA.html document. patientA.html : GET : !CommonName=("Dr Shelia A. Jones","Dr Harry S. Smith") 9.67.*.* In the above example, SSL client authentication must be set up, andthe client must be making an https request from an IPaddress beginning with 9.67 and have a client certificate with acommon name of Dr Shelia A. Jones or Dr Harry S. Smithto access the patientA.html document. Hints and tips for coding SSL client authentication parameters Specify any or all of a client or CA's DN. Specify the DN information for multiple clients orCAs on a given parameter. The DN information should beseparated by a comma and enclosed in parentheses(as shown in the above example). Enclose DN information that contains blanks orspecial characters indouble quotes (as shown in the above example). Make sure the DN information matches the DN informationin the client's certificate.This information is case sensitive and must have the samepunctuation. All of the ACL rule must be on one line. Do not use wildcard characters for any of the parameters. Protection example (without SSL client authentication) Following are examples of the files you can usefor protecting your server resources.These files do not use anyof the secure network communications functions.In the files where they are allowed,comments begin with the pound sign (#) in the first column. Following is an example of the protection related portion ofa server's configuration file.    Protection    POND-PROT {     ServerID    Feathered     Authtype    Basic     PasswdFile  C:\tcpip\etc\flying.pwd     GroupFile   C:\tcpip\etc\nesters.group     GetMask     All@*.swimmer.org     PutMask     quacks,billface     DeleteMask  bigbird@pond.hq.swimmer.org   }   #   # The above Protection directive defines a protection setup named   # POND-PROT.  The Protection directive must be placed before any   # Protect or DefProt directives that point to it. The Mask   # subdirectives restrict access as follows:   # o Any requester from a host name ending with .swimmer.org can   #   GET files.  They must be able to enter any user name and   #   password defined in the C:\TCPIP\etc\flying.pwd password file.   # o To PUT files, the requester must match the restrictions   #   defined for the group named quacks in the   #   C:\TCPIP\etc\nesters.group server group file.   #   Or, the requester must enter the user name billface and the   #   password defined for it in the C:\TCPIP\etc\flying.pwd   #   password file.   # o To DELETE files, the requester must be from the host named   #   pond.hq.swimmer.org.  The requester must enter the user name   #   bigbird and the password defined for it in the   #   C:\TCPIP\etc\flying.pwd password file.   #   Protect   /wetland/creatures/*   POND-PROT   #   # Any request beginning with /wetland/creatures/   # activates protection as defined in the protection setup   # labeled POND-PROT   #   Protect   /vegetation/*        C:\WWW\proset\webster.setup   #   # Any request beginning with /vegetation/ activates protection   # defined in the separate protection setup file named   # C:\WWW\proset\webster.setup   #   Protect   /flocks/*   {     DeleteMask   @9.67.84.5     MASK         Anybody@9.67.*.*   }   #   # The above Protect directive contains an in-line protection setup.   # Any request beginning with /flocks/ activates protection   # defined as part of the Protect directive.  The mask subdirectives   # restrict access as follows:   # o To delete files, the requester must be at the host with   #   IP address 9.67.84.5   # o To use any other enabled HTTP method, the requester must   #   be at a host with an IP address beginning with 9.67.   # (@ by itself and Anybody@ both mean the same thing.)   # Since only address protection is being used, there is no need for   # the Authtype, ServerID, PasswdFile, and GroupFile subdirectives.   #   Pass  /wetland/creatures/*   D:\freshwater\animals\*   #   # For requests beginning with /wetland/creatures/, the server   # goes to the d:\freshwater\animals\ directory to find the file.   #   Pass  /*   D:\SServer\HTML\*   #   # For any requests not matching other Pass directives, the server   # goes to the D:\SServer\HTML\ directory (the document root   # directory).  For example, if the server received the request   # /vegetation/cattail.html,  it would look for the cattail.html   # file on D:\SServer\HTML\vegetation.   # Following is an example of what thec:\WWW\proset\webster.setup file might look like:    ServerID    Webby   Authtype    Basic   PasswdFile  C:\TCPIP\etc\flying.pwd   GroupFile   C:\TCPIP\etc\nesters.group   GetMask     All@(123.45.*,water.*)   PutMask     goosegg,webfooter,nest   DeleteMask  (swandude,billface)@(water.fowl.com,123.45.2.*)   ACLOverride On   #   # The mask subdirectives restrict access based on a combination of   # user names and passwords and address templates.  However, since   # ACLOverride is on, these subdirectives are ignored and the ACL   # file is used.  For user name and password protection, the ACL file   # must use the C:\TCPIP\etc\flying.pwd password file and the   # C:\TCPIP\etc\nesters.group server group file.   # Following is an example of what theC:\TCPIP\etc\flying.pwd file might look like:    bigbird:vfzDlIeUzFzCt:The big guy   duckman:PVz1Y6YFI8IY3:The duck   swandude:FexekemFhY7q8:Swanee   billface:ZereWePF0YJqK:Orange nosed one   goosegg:dh*ySyZJPOqrw:Shut out Note: When you look at the contents of the password file, you cannot seethe passwords because they are encrypted.To manage the password file you must use the htadm command.Do not edit password files with a text editor. Following is an example of what theC:\TCPIP\etc\nesters.group file might look like:    ducks  : (webfoot,billface)@96.96.3.1,swandude   geese  : goosegg,bagel@(walden.pond.*.*,123.*.*.*)   quacks : ducks,geese,Anybody@43.234.*   nest   : All@(water.fowl.*,nesting.*.*)   #   # The quacks group demonstrates how you can use previously   # defined groups in a subsequent group definition.  The quacks   # group includes both the ducks and geese groups.  Additionally,   # the quacks group includes address template protection for any   # requests from hosts with an IP address beginning with 43.234.   # Requests from matching hosts would not be prompted for a user   # name and password. Following is an example of what the .www_acl fileon D:\SServer\HTML\vegetation might look like.    *             : GET             :  All   *.html,       : GET,POST        :  nest   billed.html   : GET,POST        :  duckman,geese   welcome.html  : GET,POST,DELETE :  bigbird   #   # All restrictions come from the ACL file because the protection   # setup specified ACLOverride On.  The user names and groups used   # in the ACL file must be defined in the password and server group   # file identified in the protection setup. Protection example (with SSL client authentication) You can restrict who can access documents byusing password files and/or user or group authentication in protectionsetups as shown in the examples in "Protection example (without SSL client authentication)".You can further restrict who can access documents by codingSSL client authentication parameters in protection setups,ACL files, or both. The following examples assume that SSL client authentication has been setup by specifying SSL client authentication on the Security Configurationform or by coding the SSLClientAuth directive in the configurationfile. Protection SSL_CLIENT_AUTH {   CommonName="Dr Sheila A. Jones","Dr Harry S. Smith"   Country=US   Organization="RTP Quick Care"} For a server to serve the document, the server authenticates the clientby requesting and ensuring the client has a valid certificate.In this case, for the certificate to be valid, the Distinguished Nameof the client must be made up of a Common Name of either Dr Sheila A.Jones or Dr Harry S. Smith, an organization of RTP Quick Care Center,and a country of US. If you want to allow all persons with an organization unit ofPediatrics to access the documents protected by th SSL_CLIENT_AUTHprotection setup, you could specify: Protection SSL_CLIENT_AUTH {   OrgUnit=Pediatrics} The Protect directive that maps the request to the protection setupfollows the protection setup: Protect \secure_docs\* SSL_CLIENT_AUTH Any request beginning with secure_docs activates protection asdefined in the protection setup SSL_CLIENT_AUTH. Note: If you code SSL client authentication parameters in ACL filesand not in protection setups, you must also have a Protect statementlike the one in the above example.

The Internet Connection Secure Server provides an SNMP management information base(MIB) so you can use any network management system,such as IBM NetView for AIX, TME10 Distributed Monitoring,or HP OpenView,to monitor your server's health, throughput, and activity.The MIB data describes the Web server being managed,reflects current and recent server status,and provides server performance data. The network management system uses SNMP GET commandsto look at MIB values on other machines.It then can notify you if specified threshold values are exceeded.You can affect server performance, by modifying configurationdata for a server, to proactively tune or fix server problemsbefore they become server outages. SNMP commands and protocol The system usually provides an SNMP agentfor each network management station.The user or a programmer sends a GET command to the SNMP agent.In turn, this SNMP agent sends a GET command to retrievethe specified MIB variable values from a subagent responsiblefor those MIB variables. The Internet Connection Secure Server provides a subagent that updates and retrieves MIB data.The subagent responds with the appropriate MIB datawhen the SNMP agent sends a GET command.The SNMP agent communicates the data to the network management station.The network management station can notify youif specified threshold values are exceeded. +---Remove label box when art is ready - viola-------------------------------+ icsl1mb1 artwork to be in 12/19 drop to NLS +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ The Internet Connection Secure Server SNMP support includes an SNMP subagent that usesDistributed Protocol Interface (DPI) capability.DPI is an interface between an SNMP agent and its subagents.

Enabling SNMP on your OS/2 system To get an SNMP agent for OS/2, install theSystemView Agent Developers toolkit for OS/2 which can be downloadedfrom the http://www.software.ibm.com/download/ URL.To configure the SystemView SNMP agent, follow the instructionsin "Providing a security password for SNMP". Providing a security password for SNMP You can create passwords to control access to a particularcommunity of monitored servers.The default SNMP community name is public. Before creating passwords for server communities,configure the SystemView SNMP agent. From your desktop, click on the SystemView Agent icon. Click on the OS/2 Agent Configuration icon. The SNMP Configuration Notebook displays. On the front page of the SNMP Configuration Notebook,enter the following values before testing SNMP access. Community name: public Hostname: 0.0.0.0 Netmask: 0.0.0.0 These values allow any host in any networkto access the SNMP MIB variables.After you have verified that these values work, you can changethem according to your requirements. Under the SNMP tab, start snmpd with the -dpiand -transport udp options selected.Other options can be specified as well. For more information about configuring the SystemView SNMP agent,see the on-line SystemView Agent for OS/2 User's Guide.. Use the SNMPCommunityName directive to define the passwordused between the Internet Connection Secure Server DPI subagent and the SNMP agent.The default is public.If you change this value, you must also add the new community nameto the SystemView AgentSNMP Configuration Notebook.For more information about the SNMPCommunityName directive,see "SNMPCommunityName - Providing a security password for SNMP". Turning the SNMP support on and off from the httpd command Use these flags to turn the SNMP support in the Internet Connection Secure Server on and off. The -snmp flag turns the SNMP support on.The -nosnmp flag turns the SNMP support off. This overrides what is defined in the httpd.conf file. For more information about the httpd command, see "httpd command". Monitoring server performance and status The Internet Connection Server Activity Monitor allows you to display server and networkperformance and status statistics, and access log entries,without being on the same machine that is running the server.This option provides significantly more informationthan opening the console window. Using the Server Activity Monitor function You do not need to enable or configure this function.By default, the Server Activity Monitor is enabled by the following Service directivein the configuration file:   Service   /Usage/* INTERNAL:UsageFn To view server statistics,network statistics, and access log entries,use any browser and specify URLhttp://your.server.name/Usage/Initial,where your.server.name is the fully qualifiedname of your host, for example, www.ibm.com.You can also accessstatus information fromthe Configuration and Administration Forms page by clickingServer Activity Monitor in theSystem Management section. The following sections describe the type of information that isavailable and providehints and tips on monitoring certain statistics.To update thestatistics on a page, click Refresh. Server activity statistics Figure 9 shows an example of the serverstatistics that are displayed on the Basic Status page. Figure 9. Example of Basic Status page statistics +---NOTE---------------------------------------------------------------------+ Screen capture to be added. +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Hints and Tips: If the number of idle threads is high, you may needto increase the number of threads that are available to the server. To monitor server response, use theResponse time for local files statistic. To monitor traffic, use the Requests processed,Bytes received, and Bytes sent statistics. Network activity statistics Figure 10 shows an example of the networkstatistics that are displayed on the Network Status page. Figure 10. Example of Network Status page statistics +---NOTE---------------------------------------------------------------------+ Screen capture to be added. +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Note: Incoming and outgoing data valuesinclude data received and sentby the server, by other applications on the machine, and overheadadded by the subsystem.

This chapter provides an overview of security and explainsthe different security protocols. Partial Table-of-Contents Security concepts The Internet is a postal service What is security? What is encryption? What is authentication? Using the security built into the server Managing your keys, certificates, and trusted roots Working with keys Setting the default key Deleting a key Exporting a key Importing a key Obtaining a certificate Using trusted root keys Designating a key as a trusted root Removing a trusted root key Security concepts The Internet was not originally designedto protect sensitive or confidential data.However, with the advent of electronic commerce, such as onlineshopping and online bill paying, information privacy becomes necessary.In addition, intra-company communications over the Internetoften contain confidential product informationthat needs to be protected from general access.Routing computers can listen to and recordany communications that pass through. The Internet is a postal service Think of the Internet as a new postal service.This new service operates at blinding speed, sorting and routingmessages through various post offices in seconds. Unfortunately, this new postal service has an awkward twist to it.Anyone and everyone can be a postmaster, and there is nothingto prevent a postmaster from reading, copying, and evenaltering the mail as it passes through the post office.Another drawback is the lack of receiver accountability, for itemssuch as registered letters that require signatures or return receipts.As a result, you cannot be sure thatthe intended recipient received the mail you sent. Because the Internet was designed to be an open system,it allows any computer on the networkto see the messages passing through.You can safely estimate that 20% of the messages you sendon the Internet will be copied and stored somewhereby someone else for future reference.Because most messages are sent as plain block text,there is no limit to the different software platformsthat can read, copy, and possibly alter the messages you send. What is security? You would never think of sending your medical recordsor paying your bills by postcard.By the same token, few people want to use the Internet, in itspresent form, for commercial exchanges without additional security. You can consider an information transaction to be secureif it has these characteristics: Confidentiality Integrity Accountability Authenticity Confidentiality Confidentiality means that the contents of the messagesremain private as they pass through the Internet.Without confidentiality, your computer broadcasts the message to thenetwork, similar to shouting the information across a crowded room.Encryption ensures confidentiality. Integrity Integrity means that messages are not altered while being transmitted.Any router along the way can insert or delete textor garble the message as it passes by.Without integrity, you have no guaranteethat the message you sent matches the message received.Encryption and digital signature ensure integrity. Accountability Accountability means that both the sender andthe receiver agree that the exchange took place.Without accountability, the addresseecan easily say the message never arrived.Digital signature also ensures accountability. Authenticity Authenticity means that you know who you are talking toand that you can trust that person.Without authenticity, you have no wayto be sure that anyone is who they say they are.Authentication ensures authenticity. What is encryption? Encryption in its simplest form is scrambling a message so that itcannot be read until it is unscrambled later by the receiver.The sender uses an algorithmic pattern, or key,to scramble, or encrypt, the message.The receiver has the decryption key.Encryption ensures confidentiality in transmissionssent over the Internet. There are two kinds of keys that can be used for encryption(as well as for digital signature and authentication): Symmetric Asymmetric Symmetric keys follow an age-old modelof the sender and receiver sharing some kind of pattern.This same pattern is then used by the sender to encrypt the messageand by the receiver to decrypt the message.You may have used this model when you decoded the secret messageon the back of a cereal box using your secret decoder ring. The risk involved with symmetric keys is that you have to find asafe transportation method to use when sharing your secretkey with the people with which you want to communicate. With asymmetric keys, you create a key pair. The key pair is made up of a public key and aprivate key, which are different from each other.The private key holds more of thesecret encryption pattern than the public key. As a sender, you can then broadcast your public keyto whomever you want to communicate securely.You hold on to the private key and protect it with a password. Unlike symmetric keys, the private key andthe public key are not the same.As a result, only you can decrypt a message that has been encryptedwith your public key, because only you have the private key. A protocol like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) uses both public keycryptography and symmetric key cryptography.Public key cryptography is used for the TCP/IP handshake. Duringthe handshake the master key is passed from the client to theserver. The client and server make their own session keys usingthe master key. The session keys are used to encrypt and decryptdata for the remainder of the session. What is authentication? Authentication is the process used to verify identity,so that you can make sure that others are who they say they are.There are two ways in which the server uses authentication: Digital signature Digital certificates A digital signature is a unique mathematically computed signaturethat ensures accountability.You can think of a digital signature as being like a credit cardwith your picture on it.But how do you know if the person sending you a messageis who he says he is? You look at the sender's digital certificate.A digital certificate is like a credit card with a pictureof the bank president with his arm around you.A merchant will trust you more because not only do you look likethe picture on the credit card, the bank president trusts you, too. You base your trust for the authenticity of the senderon whether you trust the third party(a person or agency) that certified the sender.The third party or certification authority (CA)issues digital certificates. A certificate is made up of: The public key of the person being certified The name and address of the person being certified,also known as the Distinguished Name The digital signature of the CA The issue date The expiration date The Distinguished Name is the name andaddress of a person or organization.At a minimum, it is someone's name.You enter your Distinguished Name as part of requesting a certificate.The digitally-signed certificate includes not only your ownDistinguished Name, but the Distinguished Name of the CA. CAs broadcast their public key and Distinguished Namebundled together so that people will add them asa trusted root key to their Web servers and browsers.When you designate the public key and certificatefrom a certification authority to be a trusted root key meansthat your server will trust anyone who has a certificatefrom that certification authority.You may have many trusted roots as part of your server.In fact, the server includes several default trusted root keys,and you can add others as needed. In order to communicate securely, the receiver in a transmissionmust trust the CA that issued the certificate that the sender is using.This is true whether the receiver is a Web server or browser.As a result, any time a sender signs a message,the receiver must have the corresponding CA certificateand public key designated as a trusted root key. Using the security built into the server SSL is a security protocol that was developedby Netscape Communications Corporation,along with RSA** Data Security, Inc.This protocol ensures that data transferredbetween a client and a server remains private.It allows the client to authenticate the identity of the server.In addition, SSL V3 allows the server to authenticate a client.If SSL client authentication is set up, the server requeststhe client's certificate for any https request.The server establishes a secure session whether or not the clienthas a valid certificate.SSl client authentication parameters can be specified inprotection setups, ACL files, or bothas described in "Protecting your server".If you specify SSL client authentication parameters, theserver validates the DN information in the parameters withthe DN information in the client's certificate before servingthe document. Once your server has a digital certificate, SSL-enabled browserslike the IBM Secure WebExplorer and Netscape** Navigator cancommunicate securely with your server using SSL.With SSL, you can easily establish a security-enabled Web site onthe Internet or on your corporate TCP/IP network. SSL uses a security handshake to initiate the TCP/IP connectionbetween the client and the server.During the handshake, the client and server agree on thesecurity keys that they will use for the session andthe algorythms they will use for encryption and to compute messagedigests or hashes.The client authenticates the server.In addition,if the client requests a document protected bySSL client authentication, the server requests theclient's certificate.After the handshakes, SSL is used to encrypt and decrypt all ofthe information in both the https requestand the server response, including: The URL the client is requesting The contents of any form being submitted Access authorization information like user names and passwords All data sent between the client and the server For more information on how to use SSL,see "Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)". Managing your keys, certificates, and trusted roots The server uses the public key cryptography from RSA Data Security, Inc.,for encryption, message digest, and authentication.RSA public key cryptography is commonly used in the computer industry. We provide forms that you can use to manage your keys,key ring file passwords, certificates, and trusted roots.A key ring file is a file where you keep public keys, private keys,certificates, and trusted root keys. Working with keys As discussed earlier in this chapter,public key cryptography uses a pair of asymmetric keysfor encryption and decryption. When you create a key pair, you are asked to provide thename of the key ring where you want to keep the key pairand a password for the key ring.Then, whenever you want to use a Key Management form,such as Designate Trusted Root Keys,you'll be asked for the key ring password. The default trusted root keys that are part of the server willautomatically be added any time you create a key ring. The server also provides you with the ability to: Change your key ring password Set a private key as the default Delete keys Export a key by copying it to a file Import a key from an exported copy and add it to a key ring You can access these key management functions from theKey Management form.To access this form: Go to the front page of your server andclick Configuration and Administration forms. You are prompted for your user name and password.Type them in and click OK. The Configuration and Administration forms page appears.Page down until you find the topic Security.Select Key Management. The key management forms require that you enter thekey ring password before you can use them.If you have multiple key rings, always make sure thatyou are making changes to the correct key ring by checking thekey file name and path displayed on the form.When you complete your key management tasks, always make surethat the key ring that contains the server's keys you wantto use for secure communications is the current key ring.You can use the Security Configuration formto designate a key ring as the current key ring. When you apply the changes you've made to a security form, youwill receive a confirmation message that the changes have beensuccessfully completed.You can make changes to other Configuration and Administration forms.However, when you are ready for the changesyou've made to any security forms to take effect,you must stop the server and then start it again.The server will not pick up your changes if you only restart it. Changing your key ring password Use the Change Password form to changethe password for the current key ring file. The current key ring file name is displayed.To change your password: Old password Enter the current password used to protect the key ring file. Specify a new password Use this part of the form to specifythe new password to protect your key ring.The password must be from the U.S. English character set. The password is important because it protects a private key.The server uses its private key to decrypt messagesfrom clients and to sign messages to clients.The CA private key is used to sign the client andserver certificates processed by the certutil command. The security of a private key dependsupon this password.Here are some commonly accepted rules for specifying passwords: Make your password at least six characters. Make sure your password doesn't spell a word. Make sure your password doesn't consist of publiclyobtainable information about you; for example,the initials and birth date for you, your spouse, or children. Include at least two, nonconsecutive numbers in your password. Type the password twice to ensurethat you have typed it correctly. If you must record the password,make sure it is stored in a well-secured place. The key ring password must be specified whenthe server is started.Check Automatic login if you want the server to stashthe password and specify it for you whenever the server is started.To stash the password, the serverencrypts the key ring password and puts it in a filethat has the same name as the key ring file,except the extension is .sth. Stashing the server's key ring password is less secure soit's generally a good practice not to stash it.However, there may be cases where you need to stash the password;for example, if you have a remote server and you want it toautomatically restart after a power failure. If you are changing the CA key ring password, do not stash it. Expiration Select whether you want the password to never expire orthe length of time you want the password to be active.If you do select an expiration date, a message is writtento the error log when the password expires. Setting the default key Use the Manage Keys form to set a private key as the default key.The default key should be the private keythe server uses for its secure communications. The current key ring file name and default key are displayed.To set a key as the default: Specify key Select the key you want to set as default,as long as it is not a trusted root key.You cannot set a trusted root key as a default becausetrusted root keys cannot send and receive messages.The trusted roots are marked with an asterisk (*). Set as default Select this radio button to set the key as the default. Deleting a key Use the Manage Keys form to delete a keyfrom the current key ring file. The current key ring file name and default key are displayed.To delete a key: Specify key Select the key you want to delete.The default trusted roots are marked with an asterisk (*). Delete Select this radio button to delete the key. Exporting a key If you need to transfer a key pair or certificateto another computer, you can export it to a file.On the other computer, you can import it into a key ring. Use the Export Keys form to export a key pair orcertificate to a file. To export: Specify key Select the key pair or certificate that you want to export.Trusted root keys are designated with an "*".You may need to transfer a key pair for your own use; however,keep in mind that a key pair contains the private key,which should never be transmitted to others.The private key is what the server uses to sign messagesand also to decrypt messages that clients have encryptedwith the server's public key.If you are acting as your own CA for a private Web network,the CA private key is used to sign the certificates you process as CA.If the CA private key is compromised, then all the certificatesissued by you as a CA are also compromised. Export to file Enter the name of the file to which you wantto export the key pair or certificate. Armor password Enter the password you want use to protect the export file.Then enter it again for verification.The export file will be encrypted using this password. Importing a key Use the Import Keys form to import a key pair orcertificate from a file and add it to a key ring file. To import a key pair or certificate: Name of file to import Enter the name of the file from which you wantto import the key pair or certificate. Armor password Enter the password that was used to protect the export file. Obtaining a certificate Your public key must be tied toa digitally signed certificate from a (CA).There are two different ways that you can obtain a certificate: Buy a certificate from a CA Issue yourself a certificate using the certutil command It's not a good practice to share certificates among servers.As you'll see later, the server's keys are kept on a key ringwith the server's certificate.You do not want servers to share a private key, particularlyif they are running on different machines.A private key should never be communicated to others. VeriSign** certificates can't be shared among serverson different machines. Buying a certificate from a CA You can buy a signed certificate by submitting acertificate request to a CA.VeriSign, Inc. will issue certificates to Internet Connection Secure Server customers.We expect that there may beother certification authorities over time. VeriSign will expect you to prove who you arebefore they will issue you a certificate.Although the approval process is necessary to protect you,your organization, and VeriSign, it may take longer thanyou would like.VeriSign will digitally sign your certificate request and returnthe unique certificate to you through e-mail.After you have received the certificate into the file system,you can use the Configuration and Administrationforms to receive the certificate into a key ring. For more detailed step-by-step information onhow to request a certificate,see "Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)". Issuing certificates yourself If you act as a CA, you can sign your own or anyone else'scertificate request.This is a good choice if you only need the certificates within yourprivate Web network and not for outside Internet commerce.Clients must have browsers, such as Secure WebExplorer and Netscape Navigator,that can receive your CA certificate and designate it as aa trusted root. For example, if your company is working on a top secretproject and you want to allow access only to a carefullycontrolled group of key people, you might want to issue themcertificates so that they can share information covertly and safely. If you choose to issue your own certificates, you will need to givethe file that contains the signed certificate to users.They can then use read the certificate and designate itas an additional trusted root. For more detailed step-by-step information onhow to issue certificates, see "Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network". Using trusted root keys In order for the server to trust a request coming from a client, itmust trust the CA that issued the client certificate.If you want to trust certificates coming from a CAother than the default trusted roots included with the server,you must receive a certificate from that CAand designate it as a trusted root. With the remote configuration forms, you can: Designate a public key and certificate as a trusted root key Remove trusted root status from a public key and certificate You can access these trusted root functions from theKey Management form.To access this form: Go to the front page of your server andclick Configuration and Administration forms. You are prompted for your user name and password.Type them in and click OK. The Configuration and Administration forms page appears.Page down until you find the topic Security.Select the Key Management form. Designating a key as a trusted root Use the Designate Trusted Root Keys formto designate a trusted root key. The current key ring file is displayed.To designate a trusted root key: Specify key Select the key you want to designate as a trusted root.Do not designate keys as trusted root keys if you want theserver to use them for secure communications.Trusted root keys cannot send or receive messages. Removing a trusted root key You may choose not to accept client requests from clients that havecertificates issued by a specific CA. Use the Remove Trusted Root Keys formto remove trusted root status from a key. Note: This does not delete the key from your key ring file.See "Deleting a key" to delete a key. The current key ring file is displayed.To remove trusted root status from a key: Specify key Select the key you want to remove as a trusted root.

For an overview of security and an explanationof SSL, see "Making your communications secure". Partial Table-of-Contents Overview of SSL security Step 1. Setting up SSL Fill in Security Configuration form Fill in Create Key and Request Certificate form Fill in Receive Certificate Form Step 2. Specifying SSL client authentication in protection setups and ACL files Step 3. Using SSL with your server Overview of SSL security HTTPS is a unique protocol that combines SSL and HTTP.You need to specify https:// as an anchor in HTMLdocuments that link to SSL-protected documents.A client user can also open a URL by specifying https://to request an SSL-protected documents. Because HTTPS (HTTP + SSL) and HTTP are different protocols andusually use different ports (443 and 80, respectively), you canrun both SSL and non-SSL requests at the same time.As a result, you can choose to provide information to all usersusing no security, and specific information only to browsers whomake secure requests.This is how a retail company on the Internet can allow users tolook through the merchandise without security, but then fillout order forms and send their credit card numbers using security. A browser that does not have support for HTTP over SSL willnaturally not be able to request URLs using HTTPS.The non-SSL browsers will not allow submission of forms thatneed to be submitted securely. Step 1. Setting up SSL To implement security you need to specify the portyou'll use for secure network communications.If the server needs to ensure who a client is before responding,you need to set up SSL client authentication.When you set up SSL client authentication, the server requestsa client's certificate whenever the client makes anhttps request. Also, the server must have apublic-private key pair and a certificate. The server uses its private key to sign messages to clients.The server sends its public key to clients so that theycan encrypt messages to the server, which the server decryptswith its private key. To send its public key to clients, the server needs a certificate.The certificate contains the server's public key, the DistinguishedName associated with the server's certificate, the serial numberof the certificate, and the expiration date of the certificate. A certificate is issued by a certification authority (CA),who verifies that you are who you say you are. To conduct commercial business on the Internet, you woulduse a CA, such as VeriSign, Inc.,who is widely known by clients and servers to get a servercertificate.If you plan to implement SSL client authentication, clients canalso get their certificates from a CA such as Verisign.The VeriSign homepage at https://www.verisign.com/enroll.s contains instructionsfor how clients can obtain certificates. For a private Web network within your own company, university,or group, you could, with your Internet Connection Secure Server, be your own CA.To learn how to become your own CA and processcertificates for this server and other clients and servers,see "Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network". Use the following Configuration and Administration formsto set up SSL security: Security Configuration form to specify the port that will beused for SSL Create Key and Request Certificate form to create the server'spublic-private key pair and certificate request Receive Certificate form to receive the server's certificateinto a key ring so that the server can use itfor secure network communications To access the Configuration and Administration forms: Go to the front page of your server andclick Configuration and Administration forms. You are prompted for your user name and password.Type them in and click OK. The Configuration and Administration forms page appears.Page down until you find the topic Security.To access any security form listed, click its name. Fill in Security Configuration form Use the Security Configuration formto specify some of the securityinformation needed for your server. 1. Specify connection options Use the first part of the Security Configurationform to specify your connection for SSL and to set up SSLclient authentication. Check the box to allow SSL connections and, optionally,to allow HTTP connections.In addition, if the server needs to verify who a client isbefore responding, you can check the box toset up SSL client authentication.Authenticating clients increases network traffic.If you set up SSL client authentication, the server requestsa certificate when a client makes an https request. 2. Process your request Check your form and make sure you entered each item correctly.Click Apply to process the form. You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed.You can make changes to other Configuration and Administration forms.However, when you are ready for the changesyou've made to this form to take effect,you must stop the server and then start it again.The server will not pick up your changes if you only restart it. For SSL, the server must have a public-private key pairand a certificate. Fill in Create Key and Request Certificate form These instructions tell you how to use this formto do one of the following: Create a key pair and request a certificatefor the server from VeriSign. Create a key pair and request a certificatefor the server from a CA other than VeriSign.The other CA could be some other outside CA.Or, someone within your organization could actas a CA for a private Web network; for example,you might act as your own CA and the CA for others in your group.If you are acting as a CA, you need to followthe instructions in "Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network".The chapter tells how to become a CA andhow to process certificate requests. To create the server's public-private key pairand request a certificate, use: The Create Key and Request Certificate form to choose your CA One of the following forms, depending on the CA you choose,to create the server's keys and request its certificate: VeriSign Low Assurance Certificate VeriSign Secure Server Certificate Other Certificate 1. Choose a CA Use the Create Key and Request Certificate form to specifythe CA from whom you want to obtain a certificate. VeriSign is a widely known CA.Choose one: VeriSign (Low Assurance Certificate): Thelevel of proof required to get a low assurancecertificate is less than for a secure server certificate.You might want to get a low assurance certificateto do a beta test of security with your clientsor for some other non-commercial purpose. VeriSign (Secure Server Certificate): Toconduct commercial business on the Internet,you want a secure server certificate.The level of proof required to get a secure server certificate ishigher than for a low assurance certificate. Other: This is any other CA.For example, for a private Web network, your organizationcould choose to act as its own CA. 2. Process your request Click Apply to process this partof the Create Key and Request Certificate form. Another part of the Create Key and Request Certificateform appears, depending on which CA you choose: VeriSign Low Assurance Certificate VeriSign Secure Server Certificate Other Certificate 3. Create public-private key pair Use Create Key to create a key pair. Specify key name Specify a meaningful, unique name to identify the key pair.The key name is the label that identifiesthe key pair and certificate in the key ring.You may use non-alphanumeric characters in key names; however,keep in mind that some platforms have special uses forsome of these characters. Specify key ring Specify the fully qualified path and file name for the key ring file.A key ring is a file where the serverkeeps one or more key pairs and certificates.If you specify a file that doesn't exist,the server creates the file for you. Specify the size of the key pair Specify the size of the key pair in bitsafter considering these factors: The more bits you specify for the key pair,the more secure your communications. The more bits you specify, the more processing timerequired for encryption and decryption. With export versions of the server,you can create a key pair up to 512 bits.With U.S.-Canadian versions, you can create a larger key pairup to 1024 bits; however, if you want clients outsidethe United States to encrypt messages to the server,U.S. export rules require that the key pair be no largerthan 512 bits.If you want clients outside the United States only to verify yourserver's signature or sign messages,the key pair can be larger than 512 bits. 4. Specify key ring password Use this part of the form to specify the password that protectsthe key ring. The password must be from the U.S. English character set. The password is important becauseit protects the server's private key.The server's private key is the only key that can decryptmessages encrypted with the server's public key.Also, the server signs documents with its private key. The security of the server's private keydepends upon this password.Here are some commonly accepted rules for specifying passwords: Make the password at least six characters. Make sure the password doesn't spell a word. Make sure the password doesn't consist of publiclyobtainable information about you; for example,the initials and birth date for you, your spouse, or children. Include at least two, nonconsecutive numbers in the password. Type the password twice to ensurethat you have typed it correctly. If you must record the password, make sureit is stored in a well-secured place. The key ring password must be specified when the server is started.Check Automatic login if you want the server to stashthe password and specify it for you whenever the server is started.To stash the password, the serverencrypts the key ring password and puts it in a filethat has the same name as the key ring file,except the extension is .sth. Stashing your password is less secure soit's generally a good practice not to stash it.However, there may be cases where you need to stash the password;for example, if you have a remote server and you want it toautomatically restart after a power failure. Next, to request the server's certificate,fill in the rest of the form. 5. Specify Distinguished Name Specify the Distinguished Name you want associated with the server'scertificate and used to identify the server's public key.In it's simplest form, a Distinguished Name is someone's name. The information you provide for Distinguished Name depends uponwhether you want a: VeriSign Low Assurance Certificate.See "Specify Distinguished Name for low assurance certificate". VeriSign Secure Server Certificate or Other Certificate.See "Specify Distinguished Name for secure server or other certificate". Specify Distinguished Name for low assurance certificate For this certificate, the Distinguished Name is the full nameof the user for whom the certificate is being requested. For User's full name, specify the user's full nameand make sure it is unique.For example, if you request more than one certificate for Mary AnnJones, you might specify Mary Ann Jones1 for the firstrequest and Mary Ann Jones2 for the second request. User's e-mail address should contain the user's addresswhere you want VeriSign to mail the certificate. Next, you need to provide mailing information,as described in "6. Specify mailing option". Specify Distinguished Name for secure server or other certificate For these certificates, the Distinguished Nameis the server name and the location of the server. Note: The text for Distinguished Name will vary, depending onwhether you're on the VeriSign Secure Server Certificate form orthe Other Certificate form.Also, the User's e-mail address field, which is on theOther Certificate form, is not on the VeriSignSecure Server Certificate form. You may use non-alphanumeric characters in Distinguished Name;however, keep in mind that some platforms have special usesfor some of these characters.Provide the following information for Distinguished Name: Server Name: The X.500 common name of the server.Usually, it is the TCP/IP fully qualified host name;for example, www.ibm.com.For a VeriSign secure server certificate request,it must be the fully qualified host name. Organizational Unit: Optionally, the organizational unit.For example, you might specify the division of your company. Organization: The name of your organization, such asthe name of your company.For a secure server certificate, if you already have an accountwith VeriSign, the name in this field should match the name onthat account. Locality/City: Optionally, the city or locality where yourserver resides. State/Province: The state or province where the server resides.You must specify at least three characters. Postal Code: The postal code or zip code where the server resides. Country: The two-character country code for thecountry in which the server resides. On the Other Certificate form, User's e-mail addressshould contain the user's address whereyou want the CA to mail the certificate.If you're requesting this server's certificate, which you plan toprocess as a CA, leave this field blank. 6. Specify mailing option The mailing option depends on the kind of certificate being requested: For a VeriSign low assurance certificate,see "Mailing option for low assurance certificate". For a VeriSign secure server certificate,see "Mailing option for secure server certificate". For an Other certificate,see "Mailing option for other certificate". Mailing option for low assurance certificate A VeriSign low assurance certificate request must beelectronically mailed to VeriSign.If you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administratorwhat you need to do to electronically mail this request. Go to "7. Save copy of certificate request" for a descriptionof what you need to do next. Mailing option for secure server certificate There is no mailing option on the form for a VeriSign secure servercertificate.A secure server certificate request must be saved in a fileand manually mailed to VeriSign.The VeriSign home page, https:;//www.verisign.com/enroll.s,has instructions on what you need to provide in orderto obtain a secure server certificate from VeriSign.Some e-mail programs may alter files and should not be usedto send a certificate request.For example, some programs may pad the lines of a certificaterequest with blanks and invalidate it.Also, if you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administratorwhat you need to do to electronically mail this request. Go to "7. Save copy of certificate request" for a descriptionof what you need to do next. Mailing option for other certificate For an Other certificate, you need to consult with your CAto determine how to mail the certificate request. After consulting with your CA, choose one: Mail to: Choose this option and enterthe electronic address of your CAif you want to electronically mail the certificate request.If you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administratorwhat you need to do to electronically mail this request. Don't mail: Choose this optionif you plan to act as your own CA for this server's certificateor if you don't want to electronically mail the certificaterequest to another CA at this time.You can manually mail the certificate request later;however, some e-mail programs may alter files andshould not be used to send a certificate request.For example, some programs may pad the linesof a certificate request with blanks and invalidate it.Also, if you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administratorwhat you need to do to electronically mail this request. 7. Save copy of certificate request It's a good idea to save the certificate request in a file.If you're requesting a VeriSign secure server certificate,you must save the request to file and manually mail it later.If you're acting as your own CA for this server's certificate,you also must save the certificate request in a file.(After you complete this form, you canuse the instructions in "Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network" to becomea CA and to process this server's certificate.) Note: The text on this form for Save Copy will vary,depending on whether you're on the VeriSign low assurance,VeriSign secure server, or Other certificate form. Specify a unique fully qualified path and file namefor the file where you want to keep the certificate request.If you specify a file that doesn't exist,the server creates the file for you. 8. Process your request Check your form and make sure you entered each item correctly.Click Apply to process the form.You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed. The server: Stores the key pair in an encrypted format on the key ring andadds the default trusted roots that are shipped with the productto the key ring. If you specified Automatic login,encrypts the key ring password and puts it in a filethat has the same name as the key ring file,except the extension is .sth. Creates the certificate request and stores it in the fileyou specified and: For a low assurance certificate, the certificate request iselectronically mailed to VeriSign. For a secure server certificate, you have to manually mailthe certificate request to VeriSign.Go to the VeriSign home page, https:;//www.verisign.com/enroll.s,for instructions on what you need to provide in orderto obtain a secure server certificate from VeriSign. For an other certificate, if you're acting as your own CAfor this server's certificate,you need to process the certificate request.Go to "Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network" for instructions on how tobecome a CA and for how to process this server's certificate.For any other CA, follow its instructions. The CA processes your certificate request.When the CA is satisfied that you have met all of its requirements,it electronically mails a certificate to you.Next, you need to receive the server's certificateinto the key ring that contains the public-private key pair. Fill in Receive Certificate Form Use the Receive Certificate form to receiveinto the key ring the certificateelectronically mailed to you by your CA. 1. Specify Receive Certificate information Before filling in this form, use your e-mail program toreceive the certificate into a unique file.Some e-mail programs may alter files andshould not be used to receive certificates.For example, some programs pad the lines of the certificatewith trailing blanks, which invalidates it. For the Receive Certificate form, provide: Name of file containing certificate: Thefully qualified path and file name of thefile that contains the certificate. Key ring: The fully qualified path andfile name of the key ring.This is the key ring you specified on the Create Key andRequest Certificate form when you created the server'spublic-private key pair and the request for this certificate. Key ring password: The password for the key ring.This is the password you specified on the Create Key andRequest Certificate form when you created the server'spublic-private key pair and the request for this certificate. 2. Process your request Check your form and make sure you entered each item correctly.Click Apply to process the form. You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed. The server stores the certificate in the key ring.It is referenced in the key ring with the key nameyou specified on the Create Key and Request Certificate form. After you receive your Confirmation for the Receive Certificate form,you can make changes to other Configuration and Administration forms.However, when you are ready for the changesyou've made to any security forms to take effect,you must stop the server and then start it again.The server will not pick up your changes if you only restart it. When you start the server, you will be prompted forthe key ring password unless you stashed itby selecting Automatic loginon the Create Key and Request Certificate form. Step 2. Specifying SSL client authentication in protection setups and ACL files With SSL V3, you can set up your server for SSL clientauthentication.The server requests a certificate from any clientmaking an https request.The server establishes a secure connection whether or not theclient has a valid certificate. You can restrict who can access documents byusing password files and/or user or group authentication in protectionsetups as described in "Protecting your server".You can further restrict who can access documents by codingSSL client authentication parameters on protection setups,ACL files, or both.See "Creating protection setups for SSL client authentication"for more information on coding protection setups.See "Step 5. Limiting access to individual files"for more information on coding ACL files. Step 3. Using SSL with your server Once you have a key pair and a signed certificate, you can beginserving SSL protected documents to SSL browsers. Before you begin using SSL, you should consider doing thefollowing: Set up a proxy server.See "Running your server as a proxy" for information on howto set up your server as a proxy. If you are writing CGI programs, make useof the following SSL environment variables: HTTPS HTTP_KEYSIZE [ Top of Page | Previous Page | Next Page | Table of Contents ] WT03-B16-10IA074-000483-B008-281http://acc123.usc.edu:80/Docs/icswg013.html 128.125.48.102 19970125004431 text/html 23772HTTP/1.1 200 Document follows.

You may, however, have a project for your company,university, or group where you want to act as your own CA fora private Web network.The Internet Connection Secure Server allows you to be your own CA.As a CA, you will use a utility called certutil,which is provided with the Internet Connection Secure Server, to create signed certificates.However, clients must have browsers, such as Secure WebExplorer orNetscape Navigator,that can receive your CA certificate and designate it as atrusted root. Note: Your use of this utility is limited to directly certifying end userto end user exchange of data. You are not authorized to issuecertificates to third parties or allow others to do so, or to usethis utility for any other purpose. This chapter tells you how to become your own CA and then how toprocess certificate requests as a CA. Partial Table-of-Contents Becoming a CA Create CA's public-private key pair and request CA's certificate Receive CA's certificate Designate the CA key as a trusted root Processing certificates as a CA Use certutil command to process client and server certificates Becoming a CA Your job as CA is to verify that a certificate shouldbe issued for a client or server.You need to make sure that the person making the request hasa legitimate claim to the name in the request.For example, if your company is working on a top secret project,your issuance of a certificate can give a person access to topsecret information. After you have verified a person's claim, you will usethe certutil command toprocess the certificate request.The output from the certutil command is a certificatesigned with your CA private key. After you verify that the information in the certificatecreated by certutil is correct, you will: Send your CA certificate to the client or server for whomyou're acting as CA.The client or server needs to receive your CA certificate anddesignate it as a trusted root. Send the client or server its certificate, which you processedas a CA.The client or server needs to receive its certificate into its key ringafter it has received the CA certificate and designated it as atrusted root. Before you can process certificate requests as a CA, you need to do thefollowing to become a CA: Create your CA public-private key pair and request aCA certificate Receive your CA certificate (which is the same as the CA certificaterequest) into your CA key ring Designate your CA key as a trusted root You must carefully protect your CA private key.If it is compromised, then all the certificates you've issuedwill also be compromised. Create CA's public-private key pair and request CA's certificate This chapter describes how to usethe Create Key and Request Certificate form to create your CApublic-private key pair and request your CA certificate. Choose Other. Click Apply to process this part of the Create Keyand Request Certificate form.The Other Certificate form appears. Use Create Key to create your CA key pair. Specify Key name:Specify a meaningful, unique name to identify your CA key pair.The key name is the label that identifiesthe key pair and certificate in the key ring.You may use non-alphanumeric characters in key names; however,keep in mind that some platforms have special uses for some ofthese characters. Specify Key ring:Specify the fully qualified path and file name for the key ring file.It's best to use a separate key ring to keep your CA key pair.If you specify a file that doesn't exist for key ring, theserver creates the file for you. Specify the Size of the Key Pair:Your private CA key will be used to sign the server and clientcertificates you process as CA.Your CA public key will be used by those clients and servers toverify your CA signature.The larger the CA key pair, the more secure the key pair will be.If the CA private key is compromised, then all the certificatesissued by the CA are also compromised. Specify a Password:Use this part of the form to specify the passwordthat protects your CA key ring.You should keep your CA keys in a separate key ringwith its own password.If your CA private key is compromised,then all the certificates you've issuedas a CA are also compromised. The password must be from the U.S. English character set. The security of your CA private key, which is used to sign theclient and server certificates you process as a CA, dependsupon this password.Here are some commonly accepted rules for specifying passwords: Make the password at least six characters. Make sure the password doesn't spell a word. Make sure the password doesn't consist of publiclyobtainable information aboutyou; for example, the initials and birth date for you, your spouse,or children. Include at least two, nonconsecutive numbers in the password. Type the password twice to ensure that you have typedit correctly. If you must record the password, make sure it is stored in awell-secured place. If, as recommended, you put your CA key pair on a separate keyring, do not check AutomaticLogin to stash the password for the CA key ring. Specify Distinguished Name:Specify the Distinguished Name you want associated with yourCA certificate and used to identify your CA public key. Provide the following information for Distinguished Name: Server Name: Usually the X.509 common name of the server,which is usually the TCP/IP fully qualified host name;for example, www.ibm.com. Optionally, Organizational Unit Organization Optionally, Locality or City At least three characters for State or Province Postal code or zip code. The two-character country code for the country in which theserver resides Don't specify User's e-mail address. Specify Mailing Option:Choose Don't mail. Save Your Certificate Request:Save your CA certificaterequest in a unique file.The server creates the file for you. Check your form and make sure you entered each item correctly. Click Apply to process the form.You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed. The server: Stores the key pair in an encrypted format on the key ring. Creates the certificate request and stores it in the fileyou specified. Next, you need to receive your CA certificate request. Receive CA's certificate Use the Receive Certificate form toreceive the CA certificate request that you saved.The CA's certificate is the same as the certificate request. Provide: Name of file containing certificate: Thefully qualified path and file name of thefile in which you saved the CA certificate request (Savecertificate request to file on the Create Key andRequest Certificate form). Key ring: The fully qualified path and file name ofthe key ring you specified on theCreate Key and Request Certificate form foryour CA certificate. Key ring password: The password you specified on theCreate Key and Request Certificate form for your CAkey ring. Check your form and make sure you entered each item correctly. Click Apply to process the form.You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed. The server stores your CA certificate in the CA key ring.It is referenced in the key ring with thekey name you specified on the Create Keyand Request Certificate form. You now have your CA certificate(also known as a self-signed certificate)signed with yourCA private key in your CA key ring. Next, the CA key needs to be a trusted root on the server. Designate the CA key as a trusted root Use the Key Management form. Check the key ring file name shown on this form.If it is not the key ring that contains your CA key,go to the Security Configuration formand designate your CA key ring as the current key ring.After you receive your confirmation message,come back to the Key Management form, which should showthe CA key ring as the current key ring. Specify the key ring password for the CA key. Choose the option Designate Trusted Root Keys. Click Apply to process the form.The Designate Trusted Root Keys form appears. On the Designate Trusted Root Keys form: Select the name of the CA key. Click Apply to process the form.You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed. If you have akey ring that contains keys the server uses for securenetwork communications, it should be the current key ring.You can use the Security Configuration form to designatethe server's key ring as the current key ring. Now, you are ready to process the certificate request for clients andservers. Processing certificates as a CA After you have created your CA key pair, obtained your CA certificate,and designated your CA public key as a trusted root, you are readyto act as a CA and process certificatesfor this server and for other servers andclients. Servers can use the Configuration and Administration formsto create their public-private key pair and request theircertificate.They should use the Other Certificate form.If you provide them with your e-mail address, they can specifyit on the form and have the certificate request electronicallymailed to you.Or, they can save the certificate request in a file andelectronically mail it to you later. Some browsers, such as Secure WebExplorer and Netscape Navigator,allow clients to create their public-privatekey pair and request their certificate.Clients can electronically mail their certificate requests toyou. Some e-mail programs may alter files and should not be usedto send or receive certificate requests or certificates.For example, some programs may pad the lines of the certificaterequest or certificate with blanks and invalidate it. To process certificates for clients and servers, you will: Receive certificate requests from clients and servers and verifythat the person making the request has a legitimate claim to thename in the request. Use the certutil command to process the certificate request.The outputfrom the certutil command is a certificate signed with your CA privatekey. Check the information printed in the output file and verifyto whom the certificate is being issued before sending itto the client or server. Send the client or server: Your CA certificate. This certificate must be received into thekey ring of the client or server and then designated as a trustedroot. The client or server certificate that was processed by you as CA.After the client or server has received the CA certificate into itskey ring and designated it as a trusted root, the client or servercan receive its certificate into the key ring. Then, the client or server can use the certificate you created as aCA to communicate securely with other clients and servers withinyour private Web network. Use certutil command to process client and server certificates Use the certutil command to process certificate requests for the clientsand servers for whom you're acting as CA.The output of the certutil command isa client or server certificate that has beensigned with your private CA key. Before using the certutil command, verify that the person makingthe request has a valid claim to the name in the request. Format certutil [-p validity-period] [-k ca-key-ring] < cert-req-file > cert-file-name validity-period can be 1 to 9999for the number of days the certificate is valid.If you don't specify validity-period,the default is 365 days. ca-key-ring is the fully qualified path and filename you specified for the CA Key ring onthe Create Key and Request Certificate form.If you don't specify ca-key-ring,the default is keyfile.kyr. cert-req-file is the fully qualified path and filename of the file thatcontains the client or server certificate you are processing.For clients or servers who mail their certificate request toyou through e-mail, it is the file into which you received thecertificate request with your e-mail program.For a certificate for this server, it is the file you specifiedforSave certificate request to file on the Create Keyand Request Certificate form when you were requesting theserver certificate. cert-file-name is the unique, fully qualified pathand file name of the output file where you want toput the signed certificate created by the certutil command. Example certutil -p 730 -k D:/WWW/BIN/cakeyfil.kyr < D:/WWW/BIN/CertReq.txt> D:/WWW/BIN/Cert.txt Note: The certutil command should be on one line.It is shown on more than one line because of formatting. After you enter the command, you are prompted forthe password of the key ring that has the CA key. If certutil cannot create the signed certificate, you will getan error message. It's a good idea to check the output file and verifythat the certificate correctly states to whom it is being issued. What you do next depends on whose certificate you are processing: If you are processing this server's certificate, go to"Receive certificate for this server". If you are processing certificates for other servers orclients, go to "Send clients and other servers their processed certificates". Receive certificate for this server If you are processing this server's certificate, you need to: Use the Receive Certificate form toreceive the CA certificate into the server's key ring. Provide: Name of file containing certificate:Specify the file name of the file into which you saved theCA certificate request.The request is the same as the CA's certificate. Key ring: The key ring you specified on theCreate Key and Request Certificate form when youcreated this server's keys and requested its certificate. Key ring password: The password you specified on theCreate Key and Request Certificate form for this server'skey ring. Check your form and make sure you entered each item correctly. Click Apply to process the form.You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed. The server stores the certificate in its key ring.It is referenced in the key ring with thekey name you specified on the Create Keyand Request Certificate form for the server's certificate. Go to the Key Management form.Make sure that the server's key ring is the current key ring.If it is not the current key ring, go to the Security Configurationform and make the server's key ring the current key ring.After you receive the confirmation message, come backto the Key Management form. On the Key Management form,specify the key ring password for the server's key ring. Choose the option Designate Trusted Root Keys andclick Apply to process the form.The Designate Trusted Root Keys form appears. On the Designate Trusted Root Keys form,select the CA certificate.For the CA certificate, you will see the Distinguished Name (DN)of the CA rather than the key name. Click Apply to process the form.You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed. Use the Receive Certificate form toreceive the server's certificate into its key ring. Provide: Name of file containing certificate:Specify the file name you provided for cert-file-namewhen you used the certutil command. Key ring: The key ring you specified on theCreate Key and Request Certificate form when youcreated this server's keys and requested its certificate. Key ring password: The password you specified on theCreate Key and Request Certificate form for this server'skey ring. Check your form and make sure you entered each item correctly. Click Apply to process the form.You receive a Confirmation that the form was successfully processed. The server stores the certificate in its key ring.It is referenced in the key ring with thekey name you specified on the Create Keyand Request Certificate form for the server's certificate. After you receive your Confirmation for the Receive Certificate form,you can make changes to other Configuration and Administration forms.However, when you areready to use the server's keys for secure network communications,you must stop the server and then start it again.The server will not pick up the changes you've made to the key ringif you only restart it. Send clients and other servers their processed certificates You need to send the clients and other servers for whom you areacting as CA: Your CA certificate.Clients and other servers need to receive this certificate anddesignate it as a trusted root.You can send clients and servers your CA certificate request.It is your signed CA certificate. The client or server certificate you processed as CA.After the client or server has received the CA certificate anddesignated it as a trusted root, the client or server canreceive its certificate into the key ring. Note: Some e-mail programs may alter files and should not be usedto send or receive certificate requests or certificates.For example, some programs may pad the lines of the certificaterequest or certificate with blanks and invalidate it. After a client or server receives the CA certificate, designatesit as a trusted root, and receives the client or server certificate,the client or server certificate can be usedfor secure network communications.Before a server's keys are used for secure network communications,the server must be stopped and then started again.The server will not pick up the changes you madeto the server's key ring if you only restart it.

Companies that operate across European borders have long recognised the broad benefits of greater harmonisation, but how should they be shaping their reward programmes to make the most of the opportunities that integration brings? What should be the future direction of European people policy? To answer these questions, Towers Perrin is sponsoring a research programme that consists of: a two-day conference -- 'Reward 2000' -- to be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 6 and 7 March 1997 a major survey of reward practices among large European companies, the results of which will be presented at the conference. 'Reward 2000' will examine the theoretical, practical, cultural, organisational and business implications of European reward practices post-millennium. As such, it will be of particular interest to HR directors and managers, and compensation and benefits managers of European multinational companies and European subsidiaries.

For some multinationals, those assets can be comparable with the capital employed in the businesses, while their worldwide pension obligations often represent the largest liability on the balance sheet. And these foreign pension liabilities and costs are projected to grow dramatically in the future, fueled by: the ageing of the workforce the privatisation of social security systems in many parts of the world the growing number of countries enacting legislation that requires companies to provide a minimum level of retirement benefits or improve existing benefits. A recent Towers Perrin survey of 30 major multinational organisations headquartered in the US examines how they are responding to the challenge of managing a rapidly expanding pool of capital that's certain to assume growing importance to their financial performance in the years ahead. Some of the survey's key findings are listed below. Centralised co-ordination. While more than three-quarters of the companies studied have begun taking a co-ordinated approach and another 10% plan to begin centralised co-ordination very soon, a handful (about 13%) follow a decentralised approach with no headquarters involvement in managing pension assets outside the home country. Even in companies that are currently taking a co-ordinated approach, the drive to centralise global asset supervision is of relatively recent vintage. For example, more than a quarter of these companies (26%) have been focusing on their global pension assets for a year or less, and over half (52%) have adopted a co-ordinated approach within the last two to five years. Level of headquarters involvement. Headquarters staff are most directly and actively involved in three areas: asset allocation and asset/liability studies investment manager selection ongoing performance evaluation. However, the level of involvement varies considerably from minimum to advanced. Taking asset allocation and asset/liability studies as an example, under a minimum approach, headquarters would require that local subsidiaries develop policies; under an advanced approach, headquarters would develop broad asset allocation guidelines and require local operations to adhere to them, unless they can demonstrate a need for variance. Degree of cross-border consolidation. One of the more promising areas of co-ordinated pension asset management lies in the potential efficiencies that can be gained from consolidating the custody of plan assets or the management of a company's global asset portfolio in a limited number of preferred global vendors. Interestingly, one-third of the companies studied are now considering multi-country custodial arrangements and conducting exploratory discussions with leading providers. In contrast, the movement towards consolidated investment management is already well established. Almost 80% of participants have either already consolidated all or part of their global investment management work with one or more firms or are currently in the process of considering or negotiating consolidated arrangements. Looking ahead. A growing number of multinational organisations are now taking a more proactive approach in working with their foreign subsidiaries to manage their worldwide pension assets more efficiently. At the same time, however, headquarters staff are well aware of the barriers they face: cultural differences and resistance, tax and regulatory impediments, the lack of consistent information and poor communications with their subsidiaries in other countries. Over and above these, they cite the single biggest barrier as the lack of a clear mandate from senior management. Ultimately, the study suggests that those companies that are most successful in managing their global pension assets are those that have succeeded in establishing an open dialogue between corporate headquarters and local operations -- and have invested considerable time and effort in building cross-border partnerships and mutual trust within the organisation.

The surcharge applies to employer contributions to a superannuation fund where an individual's total income (including superannuation contributions) exceeds A$70,000. It reaches its full 15% when income reaches A$85,000. This is in addition to existing contributions and benefits taxes. The concern is mainly because of the administrative burden the surcharge places on both funds and employers. The proposed collection mechanism for the surcharge involves a complex series of exchanges of information between the superannuation fund and the Australian Tax Office. The information will need to be exchanged for every member of every fund, even though the surcharge will not apply to the vast majority of members. It is therefore likely to increase administration costs. An alternative collection mechanism has already been proposed by the industry (represented by ASFA -- the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia), but was rejected by the government on various grounds. ASFA, the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the two main accounting bodies are continuing to lobby the government for a revision of the proposed mechanism. Meanwhile, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the surcharge because, although it became effective from the date of the budget, the legislation is yet to be passed. Furthermore, its application to defined benefit funds is yet to be determined.

This is demonstrated by a recent collective agreement covering banking staff that was concluded in September this year. Historically, salary increases in Brazil consisted of three elements: CPI, productivity and merit. The first two of these were guaranteed either by legislation or by union agreements. Although a presidential decree in July 1995 stipulated that prices and wages could no longer be index-linked (eg to CPI, the dollar exchange rate), most union agreements between then and the first half of 1996 still granted CPI-related increases based on the accumulated official inflation rate over the past 12 months. Many companies suffered economically in this period, as tough global competition did not allow them to increase their profits accordingly. The banking agreement, one of the two most important collective agreements, now bases salary increases on expected inflation over the next 12 months, instead of over the past 12. As well as representing significant savings to employers, not only on payroll but also on social and labour costs, this agreement indicates a change in the relationship between unions and employers' federations, and thus a trend to more focused salary management. Further information: Felipe Rebelli, São Paulo, (55) 11 3040 3408 FRANCE 'Equal pay for equal work' ruling challenges individual approaches to remuneration A ruling made by la chambre sociale de la Cour de Cassation, the highest French court of appeal with jurisdiction over employment and social affairs, poses a serious challenge to employers' right to reward their employees on an individual basis. The ruling has the force of law and means that, in future, employers must be able to prove, by reference to objective data, that any differences in remuneration between employees 'in identical situations' are justified. In its 29 October 1996 ruling, the court stated that 'an employer must ensure equality of remuneration between all employees whose situations are identical'. In this context, remuneration is defined as all cash remuneration and perquisites, whether or not they are performance related. This is the first time that the court has used such a wide interpretation of the principle of 'equal pay for equal work'; previously, it has only been applied to issues of equality between male and female employees. Furthermore, the court has removed from employees the responsibility for proving 'unjustified discrimination' and has given employers the responsibility of proving that any differences in remuneration are justified. Before this ruling, employees had to prove that they were subject to unjustified discrimination if their remuneration was lower than that of their colleagues in identical situations. Providing that unjustified discrimination could not be proved, employers were allowed to award individual increases. In future, the ruling means that the existence of differences in remuneration will be taken as proof that employees are subject to unjustified discrimination, and employers will then have to prove that any differences are justified. The ruling was given in the case of Société Delzongle v Ponsolle. Madame Ponsolle, an executive secretary at Société Delzongle, based her claim on the fact that she received less remuneration for performing the same tasks than a colleague with the same job grading and a lesser qualification. The court ruled that the lower remuneration was unjustified and discriminatory. To override the ruling, parliament will need to enact legislation; this is unlikely to happen in the current session. Until the situation is clarified, employers should ensure that they are in a position to demonstrate that any differences in remuneration can be justified. The best way of doing this is by ensuring that their human resource management systems (job evaluation, competency-based pay, performance management, appraisals, bonuses) are well organised, clearly communicated and effectively implemented. Any of these systems can be put forward as justification for differences in remuneration provided that the employer can demonstrate that they are objective. Employees' job titles and collective agreement classifications should also be reviewed for consistency.

The employees concerned may well be subject to higher overall tax. The taxation of benefits in kind has historically been relatively unregulated in Italy. Consequently, companies have often adopted a variety of ad hoc approaches. Assuming the proposed rules are approved by parliament, which is likely to happen before the end of 1996, the effect will be to introduce a much needed uniformity of taxation methods. Company cars. Under the new system, annual taxable income will be calculated as 30% of the value of a car according to published (ACI) rates, assuming the individual drives 15,000 km a year. Any contributions made by the employee towards the costs of the car will be deducted from the taxable amount. Company loans. According to the draft legislation, taxable income will be equal to 50% of the difference between the interest that would accrue under the official interest rate (currently 10%) and the interest accruing under the terms of the loan.

The employees must also be given the same terms and conditions of service, including a retirement provision (if any) in addition to Central Provident Fund (CPF); and their period of employment with the previous employer must be treated as continuous with their service with the new employer. In addition, transferring employers must, in advance of the transfer, notify all affected employees and their trade unions so that there is time for full consultation. Further information: Julia Smith, Singapore, (65) 221 3588 Regulations governing foreign workers changed Foreign workers earning more than S$2,000 a month must now apply for an employment pass; an amendment to the Foreign Workers Act passed on 1 May 1996 has raised the previous threshold from S$1,500. The threshold excludes contributions to pension or provident funds; travel, food or housing allowances; overtime, bonuses and commission; and termination or retirement payments. Further information: Julia Smith, Singapore, (65) 221 3588 UNITED KINGDOM Trustee deadline moves closer Employers have until 5 May 1997 to notify trustees that they are putting forward their own proposals for the composition of pension plan trustee bodies. If any employer misses this deadline, the existing trustees must make their own arrangements for implementing 'member-nominated trustees' by 6 October 1997. Employers should take this opportunity to put forward arrangements that are appropriate to their business needs and can take account of existing arrangements with employee representatives. Failure to act means that the employer will be 'locked out' from putting forward its own trustee arrangements until 6 April 2003. The member-nominated trustee requirements under the Pensions Act 1995 mean that, whichever route employers decide to take, it is likely that there will be increased employee participation in the management of the pension plans. In addition, employees who are trustees must: be given 'reasonable' time off work to perform their duties as trustees and to receive training in respect of these duties be paid during such time off at normal (or average hourly) rates not be dismissed or adversely treated by their employer for performing their duties as trustees. Complaints in connection with any of these matters may be taken to an Industrial Tribunal and, if considered unfair, employers may be required to pay compensation.

PFPVs may be established by both investment management firms and multinational companies. Potential benefits of PFPVs include: Multinational companies may be able to consolidate their pension fund assets worldwide. UK stamp duty is not payable within a PFPV or on transfers in or out of a PFPV. Life assurance and non-life assurance fund management companies should now be able to compete on a level playing field, particularly in the area of index fund management. The legislation is intended to allow participants in a PFPV who hold units to be treated for UK tax purposes as if they held assets directly. As such, PFPVs are intended to be 'tax transparent'. Participants in PFPVs can include: UK exempt approved schemes overseas pension schemes that are locally tax approved and are accepted by the Inland Revenue. Although, in principle, PFPVs represent a significant opportunity for both fund managers and multinational companies, as yet, none has been established. The investment management industry is currently waiting for a number of issues to be resolved before deciding to go ahead with the PFPV initiative. These include: Administration: many investment managers have commented that administering a PFPV is potentially very complicated. For example, when investors in different countries (with differing tax treaties) invest in a PFPV, it is difficult to apportion the correct (different) tax relief to each investor. Acceptance of PFPVs by overseas tax and pension authorities: efforts are being made to convince local tax authorities of PFPVs' tax acceptability. New international activity: similar pooled vehicles may possibly be established by overseas authorities to rival UK PFPVs.

The regulations would apply to all foreign plans providing deferred compensation (ie any compensation that is not paid immediately) that have assets in excess of the plan's liabilities (determined in a manner similar -- but not identical -- to that used in determining the projected benefit obligation [PBO] under FAS 87), as long as the plan is maintained by a foreign branch of a US parent company or by a foreign corporation at least 50% owned by a US parent. Plans maintained by foreign organisations without US parents are not affected -- unless they're maintained by partnerships that include a US partner. Specifically, the proposed regulations would require the US company to include in its taxable income the earnings on the portion of the assets in the foreign trust in excess of the plan's liabilities. The tax would apply even where the plan has received foreign tax approval and covers only foreign nationals. It would apply even though the company cannot get the use of excess assets. Foreign subsidiaries of US companies normally pay US income tax only when earnings are repatriated. However, passive income -- such as interest and dividends earned by the subsidiary -- is an exception to this rule. Passive investment income is deemed to be distributed annually to the parent, and the US tax is due even if those earnings are not actually repatriated. According to the IRS, the earnings on surplus assets in a pension trust normally would be considered such passive investment income and, thus, should be taxed currently to the parent of the foreign subsidiary. The IRS regulations do provide one exemption from this proposed tax treatment. That exemption would apply if the employer can demonstrate that the surplus is due to favourable investment experience and that all prior funding assumptions are reasonable. However, this exemption would be available only if it's claimed annually on a report filed with the IRS. The burden would be on the employer to establish that all of the plan's funding assumptions are reasonable. The IRS proposal, if adopted as is, calls for the regulations to take effect immediately -- that is, for taxable years ending after the date the proposal was issued (27 September 1996). For plans that have a surplus as of the valuation date immediately preceding 27 September 1996, the new tax treatment would be phased in over ten years, with one-tenth of the earnings on that surplus taxable in the first year beginning after 27 September 1996, two-tenths in the second year and so on. The IRS plans to conduct hearings on the proposal in January. In view of the IRS proposal, US multinationals with foreign pension plans should conduct a careful assessment of their tax risk. As part of this assessment, companies will need to take inventory of their foreign plans and determine whether the assets in each foreign plan exceed the PBO -- and, if so, by how much. Finally, companies will need to allocate the earnings of the overfunded plans between the full-funding liability and surplus portions to determine what would need to be included in their US taxable income and what the tax effect would be. For US multinationals that have already examined their foreign plans to determine whether they qualify for favourable tax treatment under Section 404A of the tax code (see Headlines of June 1995), it should be relatively simple to identify which plans pose possible tax liabilities due to surplus assets (since these will be the plans that typically don't qualify for 404A treatment). For companies that haven't taken a careful look at 404A's impact, this may be a good time to do so.

From 1 April 1994, a number of benefits not previously taxable were brought into the FBT net, and all benefits subject to FBT became taxable at a higher rate ---- the top marginal personal rate of 48.4%. Items now subject to FBT include company cars (at varying rates), parking, travel, club memberships, entertainment, school fees and subsidised loans. Since FBT is imposed on the provider, not the recipient of the benefit, companies continuing to provide a range of taxable benefits to their employees have become liable to an increase in FBT payments. How this will affect companies will vary, depending on whether companies have introduced flexible compensation arrangements or not. Those that have adopted flexible compensation will not be greatly affected because they will automatically pass on the additional FBT to their employees. They may, however, withdraw benefits such as school fees and club memberships since these will no longer provide the employee with a tax saving. The only benefits which will remain attractive to the employee as part of a package are superannuation and company cars, both of which attract substantial tax concessions. Companies maintaining a traditional compensation approach of salary plus prescribed benefits will, after 1 April 1994, have incurred an increase in their FBT expense. They are likely to respond in a variety of ways. Some will seek to reduce the impact by making major changes to their benefits, either by reducing the range or quality. Others will absorb the additional FBT costs. However, in so doing, they will continue to lose control over their overall compensation costs; as a result, the additional FBT may hasten a move towards total compensation arrangements. Further information: Kit Middleton, Sydney, (61) (2) 2295111 Budget encourages employee share schemes Under changes introduced by the May 1994 Federal Budget, employee share acquisition schemes that are available to all employees have become more attractive to employers. Companies may therefore wish to consider providing such schemes. They are now more attractive because the Budget has introduced: an exemption from FBT on the discount (subject to a maximum) offered on the purchase of shares in the employing company the addition of the discount to the cost base of the shares for tax purposes, so that the discount itself is not counted as a capital gain, and a tax deduction to the employer for the value of the discount provided. The Budget has also effectively killed off the so-called 'new generation' share schemes being marketed by some financial institutions in Australia. Under the new arrangements, where shares or rights are offered to employees at less than their market value, the discount will be subject to Fringe Benefits Tax, irrespective of any disposal restrictions. This will eliminate the tax deferral advantages previously enjoyed by these plans. Further information: Kit Middleton, Sydney, (61) (2) 2295111 BELGIUM Global plan completed The global plan (see Headlines of February and April 1994) has now been confirmed by the Social Law of 30 March 1994. The most important measures are: A wage freeze will be in force from 1994 until 1997; no agreements that would introduce increases in salary or other benefits can be concluded throughout that period (apart from the exceptions described in Headlines of April 1994). A special social security contribution has been introduced with effect from 1 January 1994. This replaces the previously announced reduction in family allowances. The level of contribution is related to net taxable income, with a maximum of BF2,000 per month. With effect from 1 April 1994, all pensions from conventional early retirement programmes will be subject to a social security contribution of 1%. In addition, the Social Law introduces a legal framework for such pensions to apply to part timers as of age 50. As from 1 January 1995, State and company provided pensions in excess of BF40,000 (for those without dependents) or BF50,000 (for those with dependants) per month or benefits in lieu of such pensions will become subject to a new social security contribution. This will be based on progressive rates, depending on the gross level of the pension and the beneficiary's family charges, up to a maximum rate of 2%. With effect from 1 April 1994, successive employment contracts of limited duration can be agreed, provided certain conditions are met. The notice period, in the case of termination by the employer, for certain employees can now be determined by mutual consent and specified in employment contracts. This applies to employees hired after 1 April 1994 with salaries in excess of BF1,782,000 pa. The agreed period cannot, however, be less than the minimum legal notice period. This measure should reduce the financial impact on employers of the generous Belgian termination rules. Further information: Marcel Rottiers, Brussels, (32) (2) 6761811 BRAZIL Retirement benefit plans gain in popularity More companies are sponsoring retirement benefit plans for their employees(48% compared with 42% a year ago), according to Towers Perrin's latest survey of corporate benefit trends. The main reason for this is employers' desire to be competitive with other companies and to limit their exposure to open-ended benefit obligations. This has resulted in both national and multinational companies establishing defined contribution and hybrid type plans. The survey, which covers 339 companies representing all sectors of the economy, also revealed that 67% of the companies with pension plans provide benefits with a target level of up to 70% of final salary, including social security benefits. In those plans, a defined benefit approach prevails. However, the trend when establishing new plans is to provide defined contribution benefits with a target of 51% to 60% of final salary (including social security benefits). The other benefits most commonly provided are medical care, meal allowance and group life insurance, with more than 90% of participating companies providing at least one of these benefits. The full pattern of corporate benefit provision is: Medical care	                97%Meal allowance	                92Group life insurance	        91Short-term disability coverage	79Employee loans	                68Prescription medicines	        67Dental care	                60Health screening	        59Pension provision	        48Retiree programmes	        10 Further information: Luiz de Gouv�a, Rio de Janeiro, (55) (21) 2247982 CANADA Ontario health insurance coverage limited After 30 June 1994, employers will need to make arrangements for private health insurance for their foreign employees working in Ontario, as they are no longer eligible for provincially funded health care coverage. The only exception is employees going to Ontario to work temporarily who are issued in advance with an employment authorisation. This will only be given if the employee will be working: for a named Ontario employer in a specific job, and for a limited time. However, accompanying family members will not be covered. Further information: Sylvia Pede, Toronto, (1) (416) 9602840 CZECH REPUBLIC Republic follows Hungary's lead on pensions As of February 1994, employers can establish supplementary retirement benefit arrangements for their employees in the Czech Republic. This follows from a new law passed by the Czech Parliament, in the wake of Hungary's move in November last year (see Headlines of February 1994). Although there are no tax incentives for these funds, the State will make additional payments to top up an individual's own contributions.Funds must be established in the form of joint stock companies, with a minimum capital of Kc20m. It is therefore likely that they will be established by banks and insurance companies and will be open to participants on a general basis, rather than by individual employers for their own employees. Features of these new funds are: They are defined contribution arrangements. They are open only to permanent residents of the Czech republic overage 18. Contributions can be paid by any individual (and/or his or her employer on his or her behalf). The State will contribute to an individual's account at a rate that depends on the contributions paid by (or for) the individual. The maximum State contribution is Kc120 per month if an individual's contributions are Kc500 per month. The State contribution is increased by 25% after two years' membership. Benefits can be in the form of pensions or lump sums, payable no earlier than age 50. Withdrawal from the fund is allowed (after at least 12 months' participation), but in that case only an individual's own contributions (plus investment return) can be refunded. Funds can be invested in a fairly wide range of investments including overseas investments, subject to certain requirements on concentration of investments in particular assets. Funds will be managed by a board of directors of at least five members and will be regulated by the Government, which has power to impose penalties for violation of the requirements. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (71) 3794411 DENMARK Company car tax changes New rules concerning the taxation of the benefit of company cars came into force on 1 January 1994. This will ultimately lead to a reduction in the number of company car users. The new tax charges are based on a car's purchase price. For 1994, the charge is 20% of the price, with minimum and maximum prices of DKK150,000 and DKK400,000, respectively. The taxable charge will increase as follows: 1995	21%1996	221997	23 Different rules apply to company cars that are more than three years old. Under the previous system, employees had to keep a record of business and private use since taxation was based on the amount of private mileage. As the new system does not take this into account, company car owners with limited private mileage are likely to pay more tax.

The cases concerned are: Smith v Avdel Systems in the UK, and van den Akker v Stichting Shell Pensioen fonds in the Netherlands. In both cases, the pension plan had previously had a higher normal pension age for men than for women. To comply with Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, following the Barber judgment of 17 May 1990, both employers had raised the normal pension age for women to that of men. The new pension age applied to benefits for past and future service resulting in reduced benefits for women. The Advocate General's Opinion is that: Article 119 does not prevent employers raising women's normal pension age to that of men for: ---- future service, and ---- service prior to 17 May 1990, but for the period of service between 17 May 1990 and the date equalisation is implemented, equalisation requires benefits for both men and women to be based on the lower women's normal pension age. This Opinion relates only to EU law. Any equalisation changes must also take account of any restrictions under domestic contract laws or the legal documents of individual plans.

The number of employers using such surveys is expected to increase dramatically as companies realise how they can use them strategically to help unblock barriers to change and revitalise their employees in the current recessionary environment. Conducted independently and confidentially, they can meet a variety of needs: building a case for organisational redesign and restructuring assessing supervisory effectiveness improving performance appraisal methods and techniques enhancing teamwork determining training and development needs, and identifying communications gaps. Successful change in Japan is always consensus-based and surveys can provide hard evidence for Japanese management that action is essential and can help kick-start the process. In a recent Towers Perrin survey of employment practices of 229 US companies in Japan, work force skills/competencies, fair evaluation and performance differentiation were three of the top four HR concerns. It is essential that employees are given unequivocal feedback and management must be prepared to act on the survey results, even if the resulting actions are spread over a period of time.

The cap will be set at 12 times the national minimum wage. Relevant legislation is expected to be drafted within the next two to three months. Further information: Lorraine Zuleta, Madrid, (34) (1) 5642052 SWEDEN Labour legislation amended As a result of changes concerning redundancy, probationary periods and written employment contracts that came into effect on 1 January 1994, employers now need to review their practices. Redundancy: The previous legislation stipulated that, when employees were made redundant for business reasons (rather than individual performance reasons), they should be selected according to the last-in-first-out principle (LIFO), unless the unions agreed otherwise. The new law allows companies to exempt two 'highly valued' employees from the LIFO list, thereby enabling them to retain potentially high-flying new recruits, even in difficult economic times. Probationary period: Under the new legislation, employers have the right to insist that employment contracts include an initial probationary period which can be for a maximum of one year. Previously, such periods could only last for a maximum of six months. Employment contracts: Employers now have to inform new employees (ie those hired after 1 January 1994) of their employment terms and conditions within one month of the employment agreement being concluded. The information must be in writing and cover a number of specific terms. In addition, employees hired before 1 January 1994 have the right to request a written contract. All relevant information must be forwarded to employees within two months of them having requested it. Previously, there was no obligation on the part of employers to provide a written employment contract, although most employees did receive some kind of written confirmation of their employment terms. However, these may not meet the new statutory requirements. Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 6541700 UNITED KINGDOM Maternity benefits improved Under the requirements of the EU's Maternity Rights Directive, employers have extended obligations to provide improved maternity benefits. The new arrangements will apply to women expecting a baby on or after 16 October 1994. The main changes are: the higher rate of statutory maternity pay (SMP) (90% of average earnings for six weeks and �52.50 for a further 12 weeks) will, in future, have to be paid to women who have at least 26 weeks' continuous service in the same job. Previously, this rate applied only after two years' service. women on sick leave for a reason unrelated to their pregnancy will be entitled to statutory sick pay until they begin their maternity leave. State maternity allowance will be increased (from �44.55 to �52.50 per week) for eligible women who do not qualify for SMP. The Government plans to claw back the estimated �55m cost of the new arrangements by reducing, from 100% to 92%, the amount of SMP reimbursed to employers, with effect from 4 September 1994. Employers who pay �20,000 or less a year in national insurance contributions will continue to be fully reimbursed for SMP.

They are liable for tax at their marginal rate on the value of the gain. Similarly, foreign nationals who are granted share options while tax-resident in the UK are also liable for tax, even if they have ceased to reside in the UK when the option is exercised. The new rules apply to options exercised after 6 April 1994. The change in practice has come about because the Revenue has changed its definition of 'emoluments' which qualify for a foreign earnings deduction. Previously, this term was deemed to include the gain from share options, granted by an employer, outside an approved employee share scheme. The Revenue has now decided that this interpretation goes 'beyond the strict terms of the law'. Further information: Eric Duffelen, London, (44) (71) 3794411 Retirement benefit plan solvency standards proposed Following proposals for minimum solvency requirements for retirement benefit plans in the UK, there is much debate about how rigorous the requirements should be. The Government is currently seeking comments on proposals that will mean: a company retirement benefit plan can promise final salary benefits, but in the event of termination, may provide benefits that fall short of the promise. While there are many reasons for adopting this approach, the proposals will be viewed as unacceptable by those whose first concern is that the plan can deliver what is promised � under all circumstances. However, when the new legislation is drawn up it will only set minimum standards, and individual plans may choose to operate above the minimum. The legislation will not remove responsibility from employers and trustees and they should review solvency according to their particular needs and concerns Further information: Tilly Ross, London, (44) (71) 3794411 UNITED STATES CEO pay rose 7% in 1993 Median total annual compensation (salary plus bonus) for chief executive officers (CEOs) of large US companies rose about 7% last year to US$1,282,800, according to early results of Towers Perrin's latest annual study of executive compensation. These preliminary findings ---- drawn from the most current proxy statements of 107 Fortune 1000 companies ---- show that CEOs saw bigger gains in the long-term portion of their pay packages. Median total direct compensation, which factors in the expected value of 1993 long-term plan grants (including stock options), was just over US$2.4 million. Thus, the study suggests that the largest single segment of the total CEO pay package ---- the long-term incentive portion ---- now makes up about half of the total mix. These findings confirm that executive compensation in the US is becoming more closely tied to the executive's ability to contribute tangibly to the creation of shareholder value. Overall, the CEOs studied saw some what modest increases in their cash compensation last year. Median base salary, at US$711,500, increased 6%, which is in line with 1993 salary increases for employees at other levels. In addition, CEOs of just over 25% of the 107 companies studied thus far either took a salary cut or received no increase in base salary last year, while more than a fifth (21%) saw a decrease in their total annual compensation. At the same time, however, 1993 was apparently a good year to exercise stock options, with 44% of the group choosing to do so ---- for a median gain of US$593,400. Further information: Paula Todd, Valhalla, (1) (914) 7454479 Companies adjust FAS 87 rates Another recent Towers Perrin study shows that most companies have taken 1993 capital market trends to heart in choosing key economic assumptions for use in valuing pension benefit obligations in their 1993 year-end financial disclosures. With long-term bond yields approaching 30-year lows last year, all but two of the 40 Fortune 500 companies studied reduced the discount rates they use in accounting for pensions under Financial Accounting Statement (FAS) 87 ---- most by a full percentage point or more. The discount rate is an assumed interest used in calculating the present value of future benefit payments. For the group as a whole, the average FAS 87 discount rate declined to 7.26% at the end of 1993 from 8.08% a year earlier. Discount rate reductions of this magnitude (more than 80 basis points on average) can trigger significant increases in the size of the pension obligation. For example, a 1% reduction can cause a company's pension obligation to grow by as much as 15%. Downward adjustments in the FAS 87 salary-scale assumption can soften the impact on earnings for companies with salary-based pension plans. Almost three-quarters of the companies in the survey that have salary-based plans reduced these assumptions as well, although not by enough to fully off set the earnings impact of the discount rate reductions.

The favourable result, ie some 18% net of inflation, can be explained by the excellent performance of both the equity and bond markets during 1993. This is in sharp contrast to the first half of 1994, which shows negative returns for almost all asset classes. Further information: Geert De Ridder, Brussels, (32) (2) 676 1811 Flat-rate taxation of ex-gratia pension lump sums confirmed A new law rectifies an oversight in the tax law of 28 December 1992. It has now been confirmed that lump sums from ex-gratia pension promises are taxable at a flat rate of 16.5%, plus crisis and communal taxes. (Crisis tax is an additional tax of 3% on top of normal income tax). Previously, because of the oversight, such lump sums had to be taxed at progressive rates. The new measure applies to the 1994 tax year, ie to income obtained in 1993. Further information: Marcel Rottiers, Brussels, (32) (2) 676 1811 CANADA Pension plan surplus moratorium extended Employers should assess their funding policy in the light of the extended moratorium on recovery of surplus assets from Canadian pension plans. Since 1988, this moratorium has been in place to preclude employer recovery of surplus assets (unless two-thirds of plan members agree to such a recovery). The moratorium was due to lapse on 31 December 1994 but has now been extended to 31 December 1997. It affects all pension plans registered in Ontario. Further information: Gerry Schnurr, Toronto, (1) (416) 960 2709 Ontario's Employment Equity Act announced From 1 September 1994, employers will be required to develop plans to ensure employment equity for designated groups, including women, people with disabilities, aboriginal people and racial minorities. These requirements, contained in the Employment Equity Act, will be phased in over three years. Large private sector employers (those with 500 or more employees in Ontario) must develop employment equity plans by 1 March 1996. The deadline for companies with between 100 and 499 employees is 1 September 1996, while employers with between 50 and 99 employers have until 1 September 1997. Private sector employers with less than 50 employees, and broader public sector employers with less than 10 employees, are not covered by the Act. In developing their employment equity plans, employers will be expected to: communicate with employees on the process and results survey their workforce to determine their representation of the designated groups review their workplace policies and practices to determine if any barriers to employment equity exist and, if so, develop plans to remove them. Where there is union representation, the employer and bargaining agents must undertake employment equity as a joint responsibility. For private sector employers with 100 or more employees, the plan must include numerical goals and timetables for making the workforce more representative of the community. Employment equity plans must be reviewed every three years. The CEO (or equivalent) must certify compliance to the Government both initially and then triennially. Further information: Lynne Sullivan, Toronto, (1) (416) 960 7090Tax hits group life insurance Employers should re-examine the manner in which life insurance is provided in the light of proposed changes to the tax treatment of life insurance, under draft legislation issued by the Federal Government. One proposal concerns the removal of the Can$25,000 exemption in the taxable benefit calculation for life insurance. With effect from 1 July 1994, all employer-paid premiums for any group life insurance will be a taxable benefit not only to employees, but to former employees as well. The legislation requires the use of one premium rate per policy for the last half of 1994. Starting from 1 January 1995, the legislation requires that multiple premium rates, when used under a single policy, must be used in the computation of the taxable benefit. Employer-paid sales tax on group term life insurance is also subject to the taxable benefit calculation. The purchase of paid-up life insurance has, in practice, been a deductible expense for employers in the year of purchase and typically has not been included as a taxable benefit for individuals whose insurance exceeded Can$25,000. The draft legislation exempts paid-up life insurance purchased before February 1994. Such insurance purchased after that date but before 1997 will be taxable to the employee or retiree over three years at the rate of one-third of the total tax-able benefit per year. Correspondingly, the employer purchasing the paid-up life insurance may claim a deduction over three years at the rate of one-third of the cost per year. After 1996, paid-up life purchases will represent a fully taxable benefit in the year of purchase to the employee or retiree and will be deductible to the employer.

The European Commission has forwarded its proposal to the European Council for consideration by all Member States (except the UK). The proposal affects 'Community-scale undertakings or groups of undertakings' with at least 1,000 staff within Member States (excluding the UK) and with at least 100 staff based in each of two (or more) Member States (excluding the UK). The proposal's objective is to 'improve the right to information and consultation of employees'. Its main provisions are: companies covered by the proposal must create either:� a European committee, or� an employee information and consultation procedure. Both of these are to be created following agreement between central management and a special negotiating body (SNB). companies covered by the proposal do not, however, have to take either option, unless:� central management wishes to do so, or� 100 employees (or their representatives) in at least two undertakings in at least two Member States (excluding the UK) ask to do so in writing. European committees will effectively be imposed on companies covered by the proposal, in circumstances including:� where central management and the SNB wish it.� the refusal by central management to begin discussions within six months of receiving their employees' written request (see above).� the failure by central management and the SNB to reach agreement within two years of receiving the written request. Member States must ensure that European committees or information and consultation procedures are in place within two years of the adoption of the proposal by the Council of Ministers. Multinational companies operating in the EU are likely to be included within the scope of the final Directive, irrespective of the location of their headquarters. Further information: Grace Borrelli, London, (44) (71) 379 4411 Pension Fund Directive withdrawn Employers and trustees should still undertake regular reviews of their investment strategy for supplementary retirement benefit plans, despite the withdrawal by the European Commission of the draft Pension Fund Directive � that would have allowed new freedoms for cross-border investment (see Headlines of April 1994). In place of the Directive, the European Commission is proposing to introduce a recommendation that would be on the same lines as the Directive but would not be legally binding on Member States. It would, however, be open to the European Court of Justice to enforce the recommendation under any relevant court cases referred to it in future.

The Governor of the Bank of Italy has joined the Finance Minister in putting pressure on the Government to address the issue urgently. The 1995 Budget is expected to include corrective measures, including further cutbacks to the national health system and State pensions. To compound the existing problems, a constitutional court decision has added approximately ItL30,000 bn to this year's spending on pensions. The decision, which affects 600,000 people, essentially involves the review of pensions being paid since 1983. The court decision is a further example of how, over recent years, the courts' favourable interpretations have helped make Italy's State-run pension system the most costly and deficit-ridden in Europe. Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (727) 846161 Introduction of pension legislation delayed A Government committee is seeking to renew its efforts to finalise and possibly revamp Law 124. This is Italy's first private pension scheme law and was introduced in April 1993 to provide a legislative framework for such schemes. Law 124 is now officially waiting for 'implementation decrees'. However, these decrees will probably include amendments to the law itself, particularly in the area of tax incentives for private pensions. In the meantime, the 15% withholding tax on all employer and employee contributions to private pension schemes, which was due to come into effect on 1 July 1994, has been postponed to 1 January 1995, owing to the delayed implementation decrees. Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (727) 846161 Pension schemes for commercial dirigenti reviewed Commercial sector companies should examine benefit levels for their dirigenti, following the substantial changes/cut-backs, effective from 1 January 1994, in the Fondo Mario Negri (FPDAC) and PREVIR, the statutory supplementary pension schemes for commercial dirigenti. The liabilities of private schemes that integrate with these statutory schemes will be affected accordingly. Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (727) 846161 JAPAN 1994 pay increases in major firms The 1994 Shunto � the spring collective bargaining � resulted in 3.1% base pay increases among Nikkeiren members: the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations. But because many firms suppressed or decreased the semi-annual bonus, Towers Perrin estimates based on 279 firms show the real increase in annualised total pay among major firms as closer to 1.6%. With inflation running at 1.2% per year, and allowing for income taxes, real wages in Japanese firms are probably static. This is in contrast with major foreign affiliates, where Towers Perrin data on approximately 100 firms shows that base pay increases and annualised total pay increases were around 3.9%. In foreign firms, semi-annual bonus levels are either contractually fixed or have been maintained! Further information: Daishi Motodera, Tokyo, (81) (3) 3581 5731 Japan Inc pay freeze Major firms such as Toyota, Nippon Life and Sumitomo Bank appear to have responded to Nikkeiren's appeal to maintain Japan's international competitiveness by restraining labour costs. Given the difficulty of staff reductions, they have chosen to keep costs in check by reducing their graduate intake for 1994 and freezing their starting salaries at 1993 levels. The unions see this as a prelude to calls for a pay freeze or pay cut in the spring 1995 round of collective bargaining. Further information: Daishi Motodera, Tokyo, (81) (3) 3581 5731 NETHERLANDS Pension Act revised From 1 July 1994, employers will need to introduce changes to their retirement benefit plans, to comply with the provisions of the Pension and Savings Fund Act, approved by Parliament on 28 June 1994. From 1 July 1994, employees will have the legal right to transfer their pension entitlements when changing jobs. Other amendments include: the equal treatment of full- and part-time workers in the accumulation of pension rights the right to choose between a survivor's pension and a higher or earlier effective old age pension the prohibition against payment of lump sums to pension plan members who are emigrating, and the establishment of legal disclosure requirements. Further information: Lex van Vorselen, Amsterdam, (31) (20) 676 3646 Pension rights on divorce strengthened With effect from 1 May 1995, the divorced partner of a pension fund member will be able to claim 50% of the member's old age pension, accrued during their marriage. With the pension fund's agreement, this claim can be converted into a pension right for the partner during his or her lifetime. Until 1 May 1995, divorced partners are only entitled to 50% of the cash value of all pension rights accrued before the date of divorce. Further information: Lex van Vorselen, Amsterdam, (31) (20) 676 3646 Pensionable earnings increased Employers should consider the effect on occupational schemes of the new legislation that replaces certain compensation payments by an increase in gross salary. Compensation payments that correspond to the premiums for general disability insurance and general medical insurance (Overhevelingstoeslag) will now be included in employees' gross salaries, thus increasing pensionable salaries. Until 1 January 1990, employers paid these premiums on their employees' behalf. Since that date, employees have had to pay the premiums themselves and the compensation payment was introduced to compensate for this shift in premium. Gross salaries will increase by 10.5% up to a maximum of DFL8,306, effective from 1 January 1996. Further information: Lex van Vorselen, Amsterdam, (31) (20) 676 3646 SWEDEN New employment legislation introduced New legislation covering childcare allowances, partial pensions and equal pay came into effect on 1 July 1994. Childcare allowances: A childcare allowance of up to SEK2,000 per month has been introduced for children aged between one and three years. The allowance will be reduced for children who attend municipal daycare centres or nurseries. This new allowance is in addition to the ordinary childcare allowance which provides up to 90% of earnings (up to the indexed earnings ceiling of SEK 264,000 for 1994) during 360 days of the year. Partial pensions: The age at which partial pensions may be drawn is now 61, instead of 60 as previously. The maximum amount of partial pension that can be paid is 55% of loss of earnings so that if, for example, an individual opted for 50% partial retirement, continuing to work the other 50%, the partial pension payable would be 55% x 50%, ie 28%. Equal pay: The Equal Employment Authority (J�mnst�lldhetsombudsman) now has greater powers to ensure that women's pay is the same as men's for jobs of equal worth. All jobs are to be evaluated using factors such as competence, skills, effort, responsibility and working conditions. Cases may be referred to the authority either by the individuals concerned or by the unions. In addition, employers with more than ten employees have to establish whether pay differences between men and women exist. If they do, they must be eliminated. However, the law does not cover other categories of employees such as those belonging to ethnic or immigrant groups. Further information: �ke Flintull, Stockholm, (46) (8) 654 1700 UNITED KINGDOM UK contravenes EU employment law Two rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 8 June 1994 mean that the Government will have to amend existing legislation to ensure that all companies, including non-unionised ones, consult with their employees when planning either: to make more than ten employees redundant, or to transfer employees between businesses. The rulings stated that the UK Government had contravened EU laws that protect workers' rights when it contracted-out public services. According to the ECJ, the Government had not implemented key aspects of two EU Directives � Acquired Rights (1977) and Collective Redundancies (1975). The 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment Regulations) (TUPE) that translated these Directives into English law had limited the consultation requirement to those employers with recognised trade unions. The ECJ also confirmed that the UK Government had excluded public sector employees from the job security and wage protection given to other workers by TUPE. This has already been corrected by the Government's extension of TUPE to the public sector last summer. However, the rulings will enable public sector workers who lost their jobs as a result of contracting-out to pursue compensation claims against the Government. Further information: Grace Borrelli, London, (44) (71) 379 4411 Employers face retirement plan rethink The defined contribution approach is likely to prove the favoured option of those UK employers that are currently reviewing the appropriateness of their existing final pay pension arrangements. This is the implication of proposals announced on 23 June 1994 in a White Paper published by the Government. The proposals, which are expected to become effective in April 1997, mean that all company tax-approved pension plans will need to: index pensions in line with price inflation, up to 5% per year, and give employees the right to select at least one-third of the trustees. Final pay plans will also have to satisfy a minimum solvency requirement. This is the first time that a funding standard has been mandated in the UK. In addition to the proposals concerning indexation, trustees and solvency, the White Paper also proposed the establishment of a compensation scheme, tighter regulation of company pension plans and changes to arrangements for contracting-out of the State pension scheme. Employers that currently operate final pay plans that do not provide the required level of post-retirement indexation could face cost increases of up to 30%. This, combined with the new solvency requirements, is likely to lead to employers preferring the defined contribution approach. Employer actions: Employers are free to change benefit levels in respect of future service, subject to the provisions of the plan's legal documents. Key actions for employers are: review whether the current form of providing benefits in the UK remains appropriate. This includes having a full understanding of the current balance of powers between employer and trustees and the cost implications of the new proposals. understand the implications of the new solvency standard on current and future contribution requirements, asset management policy and costs. consider whether existing plans should be closed to new hires and whether alternative arrangements should be implemented that better meet the company's objectives for benefits provision. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (71) 379 4411 UNITED STATES Employers move to manage disability benefits A new Towers Perrin survey of 120 medium and large US and Canadian employers confirms that disability-related expenses make up a significant � and rapidly growing � cost of doing business for many companies. The survey found that employer concerns about rising cost levels and the impact of disability on workforce productivity are prompting a growing number of companies to improve their disability management practices. Industry and Government studies suggest that total disability-related costs now represent between 6% and 12% of payroll for the average US company. More than half of the companies participating in the recent Towers Perrin survey reported rising cost levels from 1991 to 1992, with an average annual increase of 10%. Notably, a quarter of these respondents reported one-year disability benefit cost increases of 20% or more. To gain more control over disability benefit costs, more than half of the companies surveyed have implemented or are planning to implement disability management programmes or changes in disability benefit plan design. Just under half are implementing comprehensive strategies addressing both occupational and non-occupational disability management. Yet, despite these recent efforts to improve disability cost management, the survey responses show that most companies feel they still have a long way to go to bring their disability benefit costs under control. Further information: George Model, Boston, (1) (617) 638 3779 Healthcare cost growth slows in 1994 Average employee health plan cost increases slowed dramatically this year � to the lowest level in the five years that Towers Perrin has been tracking annual movements in employer healthcare costs. Indeed, average medical plan cost increases reported by the 202 Fortune 1000 companies participating in our latest annual healthcare cost survey declined to just 6% for active employees � from 12% last year. A host of factors, including employers' continuing move to managed care, intensifying competition in the healthcare industry and the prospect of healthcare reform, is contributing to the moderating cost trend. Cyclical factors also play a role. At the same time, however, the survey shows that retiree medical costs continue to rise faster than inflation for the average employer. And a significant minority of respondents continues to experience double-digit cost increases for employee and retiree coverage.

The 28 July deadline for superannuation funds to be regulated under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act (SIS) (see Headlines of April 1994) has caused so much difficulty that the Australian Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) has granted an extension. Funds with five or more members now have until 31 October in which to make their election to be regulated by SIS. Smaller funds have until 31 March 1995. Changes concerning three other components of the new regime have also been announced: Eligible roll-over funds (ERFs): The benefits of members who are no longer contactable by a fund ('lost members') are to be rolled-over (or transferred) to an approved ERF. These lost member benefits are held and invested in the ERF, with the amount invested being guaranteed, until claimed by the lost member. Owing to delays in approving ERFs, private sector superannuation funds that have already elected to be regulated by SIS now have until 30 September 1994 to nominate their preferred ERF. Small benefit amounts protection: New measures to ensure small benefit amounts (ie those under A$ 1,000) are not subject to erosion by administrative charges in excess of investment earnings have been proposed. Essentially, these will not take effect before 1 July 1995, although certain transitional provisions will come into force immediately. Relevant legislation has yet to be released. Superannuation Complaints Tribunal: The jurisdiction of the new independent non-judicial tribunal� the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT)� has been modified. The SCT is an independent and administrative tribunal designed to resolve disputes between fund members and trustees in a fair, economical and timely manner. Its jurisdiction is, however, subject to limitation by regulations. Initially, these regulations excluded all cases involving the interpretation of medical evidence. Typically, such cases involve claims for a total and permanent disability benefit, where a trustee has determined, on the available medical evidence, that a member is not entitled to such a benefit. The Senate has recently disallowed exclusion of these cases. This issue is currently causing much debate in the industry, with ASFA(the superannuation industry fund association) lobbying the Government to seek a re-introduction of the exclusion.

Its purpose is to enable more people to share in the available work without companies losing the valuable experience and knowledge of long-serving employees. Full-time employees in the private sector can gain access to a part-time early retirement pension voluntarily, provided that a collective agreement exists and that they meet the following conditions: they are aged 55 or over they have at least 25 years' service as a salaried worker, and they are entitled to unemployment allowances for their full-time occupation. Employees who have not yet reached age 60 must be replaced by an unemployed worker. Early retirees are entitled to an unemployment allowance of BF 11,362 per month in addition to their part-time salary. They also receive an additional allowance from their employer. The combination of apart-time salary and the part-time early retirement pension means that the early retirees preserve (at least) 80% of their net earnings based on gross earnings currently capped at BF 95,575 per month. Male employees can benefit from a part-time early retirement pension until age 65, female employees until age 60. This provision is clearly sex discriminatory and is therefore in conflict with European regulations.

Foreign workers will remain eligible for provincially funded health care coverage provided that their employment documents state that they will be working in Ontario for a continuous period of at least six months. In addition, the coverage will be extended to the families (spouses and dependent children under the age of 19) of such workers, if: the Ministry of Health receives a letter from the worker's employer confirming that the employment period is at least three years, and the worker's family is resident in Ontario. Coverage will be backdated to 31 March 1994 (the date of the original exclusion announcement) for those foreign workers and their families who were insured before that date. A three-month waiting period without health coverage will operate for those who are working in Ontario for the first time or are returning to begin a subsequent period of employment.

Its main aim is to promote equal treatment between these workers and full-time, permanent staff in areas such as pay, holiday entitlement and training. The proposal is to be discussed at the next Social Affairs Council meeting in September; unanimity will be necessary if the proposal is to be adopted.

The latest news at the time of compiling this issue of Headlines is reported below. Details of State pension cuts due shortly Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini has repeatedly called for a rigorous re-appraisal of Italy's over-generous State pension system, whereas Labour Minister Clemente Mastella has said the Government may fall, if it tries to implement drastic cuts in pension spending in the 1995 Budget, details of which are to be announced shortly. Regardless of Minister Mastella's comments, the axe is expected to fall on pension benefits. In the meantime, the committee set up to investigate possible areas of pension cuts and methods to encourage private pension schemes is set to report soon. Further, it appears that all forthcoming renewals of collective bargaining agreements in all major sectors will include negotiation of private supplementary pension benefits. Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (727)846161 15% withholding tax� go or no go? The 15% withholding tax on all contributions to private pension schemes became payable with effect from 1 July 1994, with the first levy due by 20 August 1994. This was accompanied by justifiable confusion, as most plan sponsors expected the effective date to be delayed until 1 January 1995. However, preliminary indications are that, using a variety of excuses, most existing schemes have temporarily delayed payment. The hope is clearly that this levy will be scrapped in order to encourage the development of private pension schemes. At the time of going to press, the latest news is that the 15% withholding tax will be further delayed to February 1995. Amidst the confusion, the question remains: '15% withholding tax� go or no go?' Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (727)846161 JAPAN Turtle against crane Japan Airlines� JAL, whose logo is a crane� recently announced a plan to hire several hundred flight stewardesses on one-year contracts, renewable for up to three years. These would have replaced natural attrition leavers, employed on regular permanent terms, and would have provided a lead to other major firms looking for ways to ease their burgeoning labour costs under Japan's seniority-based, expensive employment system. But JAL scrapped its plan almost immediately after Mr Kamei� whose name means turtle, and who is the new Minister of Transportation� objected, and threatened adverse consequences if his warning was ignored. Clearly, this is a case of unwarranted Government interference in the private sector, and has left many industrial leaders concerned about the true intentions on deregulation and reduction in administrative 'guidance'. If the private sector is not free to develop innovative and creative solutions to the current economic recession, what chance for recovery? Further information: Daishi Motodera, Tokyo, (81) (33) 5815731 Restructuring under way A Tokyo Shoko Research survey of 825 manufacturing firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange revealed that 54.6% (451 firms) had reduced their labour costs in the 12-month period from April 1993 to March 1994. The annual savings of US$ 3.8 billion were obtained from a variety of measures, including plant closures, natural attrition, expense reduction, pay restraint and so on. Car manufacturers led the field with five in the top ten. Nissan was first, reducing costs by US$ 259 million, followed by Mazda with US$ 219 million in savings. Of the other 45.4% whose labour costs did not reduce, the main reason was mergers and acquisitions pushing up their total labour costs (but not necessarily the per unit cost of sales or output). Further information: Takashi Narita, Tokyo, (81) (33) 5815731 NETHERLANDS Social security changes proposed The new left-right coalition cabinet of Labour PvdA, Liberal VVD and centre-left D66 parties has announced drastic changes to the social security system: workers' disability and sickness insurance schemes are to be privatised with premiums varying from company to company. workers will only qualify for full unemployment benefit if they have worked for four of the five years prior to losing their job. the State pension benefits (AOW and AWW) will only be adjusted to 50% of the increase in wages. the eligibility of the general Survivor's Pension Act will be restricted by the introduction of a means test. These proposals would save Dfl 5.8 billion from the social security budget over the next four years. Relevant legislation will be submitted to Parliament for approval. Further information: Lex van Vorselen, Amsterdam, (31) (20) 6763646 NORDIC COUNTRIES EU referendums ahead Having applied for membership of the European Union, the Nordic countries (Finland, Norway and Sweden) will now hold non-mandatory referendums in which all citizens will have the opportunity to vote for or against membership. The referendums are scheduled as follows: Finland� 16 October Sweden� 13 November Norway� 28 November. The Nordic countries have been bound by EU legislation and Directives, including those relating to pay and benefits, since the formation of the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1993 but, if they achieve full membership of the EU, the consequences will go far beyond the EEA agreement. For example, the Nordic tradition of regulating a number of remuneration and benefit issues by means of nationwide collective agreements could come under pressure; conversely, the strong Nordic labour law regulations could exert an influence on existing EU members. Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 654 1700 SWEDEN Pay-for-performance gains ground The Swedish tradition of paying blue-collar workers a fixed hourly wage together with, in some cases, profit-share may have begun to change. Collective agreements have opened the way for companies or entire industry sectors to design new pay systems that include an element of pay-for-performance. A new agreement signed by the Employers' Association of Swedish Earth Moving Contractors identifies four components that may be included in future pay systems for such workers: basic (based on formal education etc) competence (professional skills, additional responsibilities) performance (how well the job is done),and profit-sharing (a group-based annual incentive plan). Furthermore, individual companies are also beginning to introduce an element of performance-based pay for their blue-collar workers. For example, the Swedish subsidiary of Nestl� has recently reviewed its pay arrangements in order to create a link between salary and individual performance. Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 6541700 UNITED KINGDOM Maternity rights improved further Two new pieces of legislation that improve maternity rights have been introduced. Employers should therefore: check the circumstances of employees currently on maternity leave or about to start maternity leave for new rights and leave provisions. review retirement plan documents for maternity provisions. review administration procedures to ensure that the correct retirement plan rights accrue during periods of paid maternity leave. ensure employee contributions are deducted at the correct amounts. ensure that insurance policies cover the 14 weeks of statutory maternity leave and periods of paid maternity leave and that other contractual benefits are continued. review current practices and policies to ensure that these are achieving their objectives.The two pieces of legislation are: Schedule 5 to the Social Security Act 1989 (SSA89) which introduces new maternity leave provisions from 23 June 1994, and the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 (TURERA) which implements the relevant EU Directive (see Headlines of June 1994) and grants additional maternity rights to women expecting a baby on or after 16 October 1994. The interaction between these two pieces of legislation is unclear and creates many areas of uncertainty. However, in summary, the legislation means that: all women expecting babies on or after 16 October 1994 must be provided with 14 weeks' statutory maternity leave. with few exceptions, retirement benefit cover must continue during all periods of maternity leave based on the pay the employee would have received had she been at work in her normal job. cover is not required for periods of maternity leave outside the 14 weeks' statutory leave where the woman is not receiving any 'pay'(although neither Act gives a clear definition of this). during paid maternity leave, employee contributions to the retirement plan can be collected in accordance with plan rules but based on the pay actually received. other benefits such as life cover, PHI and medical benefits must be maintained during maternity leave. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (71) 3794411 UNITED STATES Merit budgets dip to 20-year lows Reflecting employers' continuing cautiousness about the prospects for economic growth, budgets for 1994 merit pay increases in US companies dropped below the 4% level for the first time in approximately 20 years, a new Towers Perrin survey shows. Other trends noted in the survey� such as the growing use of lump sum payments in lieu of merit increases and the continuing move to variable pay programmes� also point to employers' focus on managing remuneration costs. More than 1,500 employers participated in the survey, representing 50 industry groups with sales ranging from less than US$ 100 million to more than US$ 100 billion. The survey confirms that US employers are increasingly using performance-based variable pay programmes for employees below the executive level. More than a third (35%) of the respondents offer variable pay opportunities to non-executive employees, and just over half of these companies extend such opportunities to all non-executive employees. Group and team incentives are the most common variable pay approaches among the organisations surveyed, followed by gain-sharing, non-qualified profit-sharing and broad-based stock option programmes. Further information: Susan Rowland, Valhalla, NY, (1) (914) 7454496 Proposal would require added pension disclosures Pension funds that hold derivative financial instruments (eg futures, forward, swap or options contracts) would face added disclosure requirements under a new accounting rule proposed recently by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The proposal would require disclosures about the amount, nature and terms of derivatives held during the year. The required disclosures would be more extensive for derivatives held for trading purposes than for those used as a hedging mechanism. Since pension funds' use of derivatives in many cases would fall under the FASB's definition of instruments held for trading purposes, many plans could face added disclosure and audit burdens� and possibly added administrative costs� under the proposed rule. If adopted by the FASB later this year, the new rule would take effect for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 1994 (one year later for entities with less than US$ 150 million in assets).

If you're an optimist, Europe is on the verge of a pensions revolution. The pessimist will tell you not to hold your breath. Either way, companies cannot afford to ignore recent developments: a coherent and deliberate strategy for benefits provisions and management is required. Together with most industrialised nations, European states face the ever increasing challenge of an ageing population. Generous state systems are not supportable in even the medium term and, as most of these are unfunded, governments have recognised that change, however unpopular, is required. At the same time, laws that restrict flexibility in the type and amount of company-provided retirement benefits, and the cost-effective financing of those benefits, are contributing to the relatively high cost base that companies on the European mainland face. Witness the recent turmoil in Italy. The state provides pensions of almost 80% of final pay with retirement allowed, in some cases, from as early as age 55. A number of proposals for reducing state provision and encouraging companies to provide supplementary benefits have been presented over the years. Surely 1995 will see this crucial step finally taken. In the Netherlands, where pension assets represent some 70% of the country's gross domestic product, plans have recently been proposed to liberalise the company pensions market. Currently, companies are required to join industry-wide arrangements or provide benefits equivalent in value, employers are required to make contributions of at least 50% of the total, and pension law is driven by insurance regulations, which are often not appropriate. In France, the generous 'pay-as-you-go' state system is under increasing strain. Reform of the system is inevitable, with increasing opportunity for private sector pension provision. The French Government sees the reforms providing a significant boost for the Paris Bourse, through the additional capital that is expected to flow into the private sector. Restrictions on how pension assets may be invested are continuing to frustrate companies' abilities to invest assets appropriately, especially now that the draft European Union Directive on removing investment restrictions has been withdrawn (see page 2). Here too, though, there appears to be both hope and opportunity. The hope comes as we see countries such as Belgium appearing to join the 'liberal' wing of Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK, by proposing to remove the requirement to invest at least 15% of assets in domestic bonds. The opportunity to enhance investment returns exists because, even in those countries where restrictions are prohibitive, pension funds still do not take advantage of the freedoms that do exist. For example, German Pensionkassen may not invest more than 30% in total in equities and 5% in international equities. Yet, average allocation is less than 10% in equities and just 1% in international stocks. We can expect to see radical changes in the way that company-provided retirement benefits are provided across Europe. Greater freedoms can be expected, offering both employers and employees more choice. Cross-border portability remains a major challenge; the move away from traditional final pay defined benefit arrangements should help. Watch this space. Further information: Marc Hommel, London, (44) (71) 3794411 EUROPEAN UNION Works Council Directive adopted Multinational companies operating in the EU should consider the provisions of this Directive (see Headlines of August 1994) which was adopted on 22 September and is due to be implemented by the end of 1996. It will apply to companies ('Community-scale undertakings or groups of undertakings') with at least 1,000 staff within member states (excluding the UK) and with at least 150 staff in each of two (or more) member states (excluding the UK). Although UK companies are not required to comply with the Directive because of the UK's opt-out of the Social Chapter, at least one� United Biscuits� has already decided to give its 15,000 UK employees the same consultation rights as its 11,000 employees in Continental Europe. Moreover, according to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), approximately 100 major companies, such as BP, ICI and Unilever, are also likely to follow suit. Further information: Grace Borrelli, London, (44) (71) 3794411 Sex discriminatory retirement benefits must be equalised Employers operating retirement benefit plans anywhere in the EU must now take immediate steps to equalise all remaining sex discriminatory benefits under their plans, or face potential costs of defending legal action brought by employees or works councils. This follows from judgments given by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 28 September 1994 in six cases involving sex discrimination in retirement benefit plans. The judgments effectively resolve the remaining uncertainties left by the Barber judgment of 17 May 1990. They apply to all countries in the EU and override local laws. The main implications of the judgments are: Employers may not be able to exclude part-time employees from benefit plans (if more women than men are part-time) and may be required to provide benefits to existing part-time employees back-dated to 1976. Employers who have not equalised their plans must provide benefits at the higher level that currently applies to men and women, for service from 17 May 1990 to the date of equalisation. Benefits for service after equalisation can be equalised at any level, subject to local laws. Trustees, as well as employers, must comply with the requirements for equalisation. Actuarial factors for calculating benefit options in defined benefit plans can be unequal, as can benefits provided from employees' voluntary contributions. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (71) 3794411 Commission acts in wake of failed Pension Fund Directive The European Commission is planning to take the governments of at least three member states to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for breaching the rules on the free movement of capital. The move comes after the Commission was forced to withdraw the draft Pension Fund Directive this summer (see Headlines of April and August 1994) in the face of opposition from member states who were in favor of currency matching requirements (ie a certain proportion of a pension fund's assets should be invested in its home currency). The governments of Belgium, Germany and Spain� all of which restrict investment in foreign equities� are likely to be taken to the ECJ before the end of the year. The Commission appears to believe that such infringement procedures are its only remaining weapon after its three year battle to liberalise pension funds. If the move is successful, countries such as Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK� which together already house 85% of the EU's pension funds' assets� would stand to gain most. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (71) 3794411 ITALY The situation regarding pensions in Italy changes almost daily. The latest news at the time of compiling this issue of Headlines is reported below. Pension reform measures set for parliamentary approval The Berlusconi Government's 1995 Budget demonstrates a clear intention to shift part of the onus of pension provision from the existing public sector pay-as-you-go system to the private sector on approach. This will be done by: reducing state benefits, and introducing tax incentives for private pension provision. Legislation on private pension provision is still in its early stages. Any scheme design or introduction should be delayed until all outstanding legislative issues are clarified. Further, companies without supplementary pension schemes for their Italian staff need to prepare themselves for a review of the pension benefits for their employees. A summary of the key measures either already implemented or currently being presented to parliament for approval as part of the 1995 Budget is set out below. State benefits: The increase in state pension age to 65 for men and 60 for women is now to take place at a faster rate than originally proposed by the November 1992 reform. In the past, retirement with a 'seniority pension' was available at any age on unreduced terms, provided that 35 years of social security contributions had been made. The new reforms will introduce 'early retirement' reductions of 3% for each year by which the individual's age at 'seniority retirement' (ie completion of 35 years' contributions) precedes his or her state pension age. No seniority retirements will be permitted until 1 January 1996 (with some exceptions) and interim measures will be introduced for individuals with 34 and 35 years of contributory service. Previously, pension increases have been based on the in crease in the cost of living. In future, pension increases will, at least in part, be based on the Government's forecast of the increase in the cost of living, as opposed to the actual increase. Accrual rates will be reduced by 12.5% for future service (starting from 1995) for longer serving members. A means test and other eligibility criteria will be introduced for survivors' pensions. Various measures will be introduced to bring eligibility requirements and pension benefits of public sector employees more in line with those of private sector employees. The minimum service requirement for 'internationally mobile employees' to qualify for social security benefits is to increase from five to ten years. How this requirement is to operate and its interaction with any totalisation agreements is, as yet, unclear. Private pensions: Information on private pension schemes is scarce. However, the Government has expressed its intention to actively promote private schemes and has introduced a legal framework� the 'delega'� to speed up the process. This framework allows the legislator to set down precise regulations without parliamentary approval. Proposed legislative amendments already in the public domain are: The 15% withholding tax on all contributions to private schemes is to be eliminated. Taxation of benefits from private schemes is to be brought in line with the more generous regime of taxation of benefits from insurance companies. The category of institutions allowed to manage pension scheme assets is to be broadened to include banks and property companies(SIMs). Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (727)846161 JAPAN Pensions reform bill passed The social security pensions re form bill was passed on 2 November 1994. Its measures are likely to lead to increased pressure on employers to keep workers on after age 60. This will eventually have implications for their salary systems (particularly seniority-based programmes) and their retirement plan design, which is usually related to final salary. Currently, normal retirement age is 60, which will be come the legal minimum requirement in 1998. Companies that are concerned about their burgeoning payroll costs� from the seniority system and higher retirement ages� should consider alternatives to the traditional retirement plan design. The main changes introduced by the bill are: The pension commencement age at which male retirees will be eligible to receive old age annuity in full (flat-rate benefits plus earnings-related benefits) will be gradually raised from age 60 to age 65 over the period 1 April 2001 to 2 April 2014. The pension commencement age for women is five years later than that for men in all cases. The earnings limit for pension eligibility for active employees aged between 60 and 64 has now been raised from ¥ 250,000 to ¥ 340,000 per month in order to encourage continued employment. The old age pension has been increased by 3.9% on average (for male participants who have recently started to receive benefits). The indexation basis for old age pensions in payment has been changed from one based on the gross salary of active employees to one based on net disposable salary. From April 1998, those in receipt of unemployment benefits will not receive an old age pension between the ages of 60 and 64. From April 1995, foreign residents who contribute to the social security pension scheme for six months or more will be entitled to receive lump sum benefits even though they do not meet the normal eligibility requirements(25 years in principle) for pension benefit. Pension contribution rates were increased from 14.5% of participants' monthly salary to 16.5% in November 1994; a further increase to 17.35% will become effective in October 1996. The contributions are split equally between employers and employees. Further information: Tetsuo Tohno, Tokyo, (81) (3) 35815731 NEW ZEALAND Human Rights Act causes problems for superannuation schemes The Human Rights Act, which came into effect on 1 February 1994, will require many employers to amend their schemes by 31 December 1994 to comply with its provisions. The Act introduced eight grounds on which a person cannot be discriminated against. The principal concerns for superannuation schemes are discrimination in respect of age, sex, disability, marital status and employment status. A controversial requirement is the banning of spouse's pensions. This was confirmed by the judgment in a test case in June 1994. The outcry over this has led the Government to introduce amending legislation which would allow all existing members to continue with their spouse's pensions. How ever, employers will still need to amend their schemes to meet the other requirements of the Act. Further information: Mark Weaver, Wellington, (64) (4) 4990277 PUERTO RICO Tax reform package enhances business environment Tax reform intended to reduce personal and corporate taxes will take effect on 1 July 1995. Employers with operations in Puerto Rico will need to re-evaluate the effectiveness and competitiveness of their total remuneration packages in light of the lower individual tax rates. Companies may also want to take a new look at their long-term incentive programmes(eg stock option plans) since the new law allows capital gains to be tax-deferred if re-invested locally. The new law reaffirms the Commonwealth's commitment to providing an attractive environment for business investment, despite recent significant cut-backs in US tax incentives ( Section 936) for US companies operating in Puerto Rico. How ever, some reform measures are designed to increase tax revenues, such as the law's provisions reducing tax breaks for meal and entertainment expenses. These changes may have an impact on corporate sales incentive programmes.

Some recommendations regarding the taxation status of retirement funds are anticipated, particularly to ad dress inconsistencies in the treatment of pension and provident funds, as well as the more favourable position of public sector pension funds relative to those in the private sector. Capping of the tax advantages of retirement fund benefits cannot be ruled out. Provisions of the Income Tax Act which enable significant tax avoidance with respect to retirement funds may also come under the spotlight. changes to the Pension Funds Act to require that funds be governed by a 'board of control' consisting of at least three members (except in special circumstances); that each board has at least one member-elected trustee, and to provide for the appointment of an ombudsman for the retirement funds industry whose decisions will be binding. A recent test case heard by the Appeal Board of the Financial Services Board (FSB) resulted in permission being given for the refund of some surplus to the employer. Although the circumstances of the case were peculiar to a specific situation of discontinuance of a fund, the comments of the Appeal Board on the relevant provisions in the Pensions Fund Act imply that a refund of surplus in an on-going situation is not excluded. The Income Tax Act does prohibit refunds in an on-going situation, however, and would require amendment. Further information: Ian Patrick, Johannesburg, (27) (11) 6373610 SWEDEN Ombudsman refers first sex discrimination pay case Companies should review their pay policies and analyse pay differences to avoid the possibility of legal action for sex discrimination being brought against them. This follows the strengthening of the powers of the Equal Employment Authority (see Headlines of August 1994), and from a case� the first of its kind� brought by the Ombudsman against an employer for discriminating against a female employee. The Ombudsman alleges that the female employee earned less than two male colleagues with whom she was comparable in terms of job-level, competence and performance. A court ruling is expected within six months. The Ombudsman has stated that more lawsuits are likely in the near future. Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 6541700 SWITZERLAND New pension fund regulations introduced With effect from 1 January 1995, all pension fund arrangements in Switzerland will be subject to two new laws. These are: the federal law on vested benefits in occupational old age, survivors' and disability benefit plans (referred to as the vesting law),and the federal law on promotion of residential property ownership with funds from occupational benefits (referred to as the home ownership law). Vesting law: With effect from 1 January 1995, full immediate vesting will be required for all benefits under all pension fund arrangements in Switzerland, regardless of the level of pensionable earnings and insured benefits. Previously, immediate vesting was required only for the minimum mandatory part of the benefits. The vested benefits must be calculated as follows: For defined contribution plans, the amount of the vested benefits will be the amount of an employee's individual account at termination of service. For defined benefit plans, the amount of the vested benefits will be the current value of an employee's accrued benefits based on past service, calculated at the date of termination of service. However, for both types of plans, a minimum benefit is guaranteed which is defined as the sum of: the money that the employee transferred to the pension fund at the beginning of his or her employment, with interest the employee's contribution during his or her employment an age-related bonus, defined as 4% of the amount of the employee's contribution for every year after age 20, not exceeding 100%. For employees over the age of 45, the amount of the bonus is equal to the amount of their contributions (ie 25 x 4% = 100%). The vested benefit must be transferred to the pension fund of the employee's new employer in order to purchase past years of service. This must be done upon entry into the new pension scheme. If the amount is not sufficient to buy back all past service in order to obtain maximum benefit coverage, then the employee can, on a voluntary basis, transfer additional amounts into his or her pension fund for that purpose. Home ownership law: As of 1 January 1995, plan participants under age 50 will be able to withdraw the entire amount of their vested benefits as described above, for the purchase of their residential property. For plan participants older than 50, the amount of withdrawals is limited to the amount of their vested benefits at age 50 or to half of the amount of their vested benefits at the age concerned. Further information: Adrian Tamburi, Geneva, (41) (22) 798 5013 UNITED KINGDOM Personal pension mis-selling corrected The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), which regulates in vestment business, has produced its guidance which will determine the fate of people who have been wrongly advised to take out a personal pension as an alternative to an occupational pension scheme and have suffered some form of loss as a result. The guidance obliges investment advisers to investigate cases of investors where SIB considers the likelihood of loss is greatest. As a result of these investigations, trustees and administrators of occupational pension schemes will receive requests for information about schemes and the benefits offered to former members as well as requests for reinstatement. Although the occupational pension industry should be seen to be fully co-operating with the SIB initiative, employers and trustees should be very cautious in their response to requests for reinstatement as, if accepted, they could prove very costly.

Almost all employers with US operations will need to amend their defined contribution plans to comply with the law. In addition to clarifying and simplifying the law concerning veterans' re-employment rights, the new measure makes a number of significant changes in the area of employee benefits: It broadens veterans' pension rights beyond requiring employers to give vesting and eligibility credits for periods of military service and to provide benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans, as the former law required. Under the new law, employers must also make retroactive contributions for periods of military service to defined contribution plans upon the employee's re turn to work. Employers would be required to make up missed matching contributions only if the employee makes up missed employee contributions. The law confirms that employers must offer continuing health coverage to employees on military leave and their dependants. It also clarifies that employers can't impose waiting periods or pre-existing condition exclusions on returning veterans and their dependants, except in limited situations. The law includes a broad, ambiguous provision requiring that employees entering military service must be extended all rights and benefits not determined by seniority that are 'generally provided' to other employees on furlough or leave of absence. Thus, employees on military duty might also be entitled to continue their group life insurance coverage or any other benefits normally continued for employees on leave from the organisation.

Many multinational companies recognize that the costs of managing their expatriates are excessive, in part because they pay these key people sizeable premiums to overcome the perception of risk associated with foreign assignments. The 'balance sheet' approach traditionally used by most companies essentially aims to provide the expatriate with the same standard of living as he or she enjoyed in the home country, including tax protection and various types of allowances. This has worked well in the past but is now being reassessed because: it uses pay in the country of origin as its main criterion, ignoring such factors as equity with other individuals on similar career paths, overall value being provided by the expatriate to the organisation and non-financial benefits such as career enhancement opportunities and greater marketability. it provides guaranteed income to the expatriate irrespective of performance in the host location. it often results in excessive costs when compared with those of local employees. In some cases, these excessive costs are inhibiting mobility and preventing potential expatriates from enjoying significant career enhancement opportunities. In other cases, companies are cutting cost simply by reducing the number of existing expatriates. But some companies have identified another solution: change the perception of risk associated with foreign assignments to one of opportunity. These companies have started to implement and communicate justifiable and understandable programmes that have already generated considerable cost savings. The expatriates are motivated by the knowledge that their experience abroad is likely to provide greater opportunities for career enhancement with their employer, while, at the same time, improving their overall marketability. Companies implementing these new policies have the following characteristics: Their senior management is committed to expatriates as being an integral part of business strategy. Many of these companies are now making international experience a requirement for climbing the managerial ladder. Processes for selecting expatriates are being improved and formalised, with the career impact for both the employee and spouse being taken into account. Expatriate pay is being restructured to be more value-focused, taking into account the expatriate's economic value in both the host country and to the organisation overall. Ad-hoc allowances are being reduced or removed, while, at the same time, significant wealth accumulation opportunities can be provided through performance-based incentive programmes. Communication processes and materials are being designed to clearly set out the administrative requirements and responsibilities for headquarters, regional and local management, as well as for HR and line staff. User-friendly communications are being provided to the expatriate, setting out all aspects of the assignment, including what is and what is not negotiable. Overall, these companies are increasingly recognising that matching the needs of the business and the expatriates is core to ensuring successful expatriate assignments, not to mention providing greater value for the organisation. The key is to ensure that the organisation's commitment to a global strategy is seen to result in opportunity for the individuals selected.

The case � Van Schijndel v Beroepspensioenfonds Voon de Fysiotherapeuten � involves a Dutch physiotherapist who did not want to become a member of the supplementary pension plan that compulsorily covered employees in his profession. Although compulsory membership is specifically prohibited by law in some countries� the United Kingdom and Italy, for example �compulsory professional or industry-wide pension plans are prevalent in others, such as Finland, France, Germany and the Netherlands. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (71) 3794411 Equal treatment Directive issued The European Commission has produced a draft revised Directive on equal treatment in occupational retirement plans. This is to replace the 1986 Equal Treatment Directive, which required member states to introduce legislation by January 1993 on equal treatment for men and women. Much of this 1986 Directive has now been superseded by the decisions in the ECJ over the last few years on the subject of equality, notably the Barber judgment. However, the draft Directive does not address some of the important exceptions to the requirement for equal treatment covered in some of the ECJ's decisions, for example the ability for deferred benefit plans to be able to use sex-differentiated actuarial factors. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (71) 3794411 ITALY Pension reforms struck from 1995 Budget After a 22-hour negotiating marathon between the Government and union representatives, the majority of the controversial pension reform measures were struck out of the 1995 Budget. These measures will be part of a new bill that will be introduced by June 1995. Mr Berlusconi boasted afterwards: 'The Budget has been saved'. The newspapers wrote: 'The real winner is Italy'. In reality, it is hard to see how any party to the discussions can be a winner except for the unions. It remains to be seen how the financial markets will react to what can be considered a substantial climb down by the Berlusconi Government. Following Mr Berlusconi's resignation, the ex-finance minister, Lamberto Dini, has been called in to form the new government. He has announced that one of the four main aims of his government will be 'the formulation of pensions legislation'. Mr Dini is not a politician, and is one of the 'technicians' of the previous government. Furthermore, he is intent on creating anon-political government of technicians. It remains to be seen whether such a government will be more successful than previous ones in passing coherent pensions legislation. Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (727)846161 JAPAN Reducing pension costs in Japan Companies have been slow to take advantage of the change in pension fund taxation introduced in 1993. They should give serious consideration to this because exemption from the tax of 1.173% of the fund book value is equivalent to an extra investment return of the same amount �valuable in normal circumstances and particularly so in the current stagnant investment market in Japan, where current returns net of expenses and tax might be only 2% or 3%. Previously, this tax exemption was limited to employee pension funds (EPFs) � complex, highly regulated plans contracted out of a portion of social security, under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and requiring at least 500 participants. Exemption should raise the net investment return by almost 1.2%. And this should eventually translate into a pension cost reduction of 10% to 20%. Many foreign affiliates should be able to qualify for the tax exemption which applies to single firms with less than 500 employees, or joint plans with less than 800 employees. The exemption applies to tax-qualified plans, funded with a Japanese life insurance company or trust bank as lead manager, that meet several requirements including: provision of annuity benefits for those with at least 20 years of service participation eligibility requirements of no longer than five years of service nor older than 25 years of age optional lump sum benefits, for those meeting the pension requirements, of an amount no more than 90% of the annuity value normal costs exceeding 30% of the rebate in social security contributions under a contracted-out plan � and therefore correspondingly higher benefits. Most plans will need some modification to meet these conditions, and at least some external funding. And some plans might need to be upgraded because of the requirement for lump sum benefits not to exceed 90% of the annuity value. But even companies preferring to keep funds in their business might find partial funding on a tax-exempt basis attractive. Further information: Gerry Williams, Tokyo, (81) (3) 35815731 NETHERLANDS Equal treatment for part-timers In future, employers will be legally obliged to provide part-time workers with employment terms equivalent to those enjoyed by full-time workers, if a bill presented to parliament on 23 November 1994 is approved. The bill ensures the equal treatment of part- and full-time workers in respect of pay, holiday entitlement and holiday pay, overtime pay, bonuses and training. It does not affect part-timers' pension rights since the equal treatment of those rights is already guaranteed under the Pension and Savings Fund Act. The effective date of the new legislation is still uncertain. This move acknowledges the increasing number of Dutch workers who are opting for reduced working hours. Currently, part-time workers account for approximately 25% of the total work force, up from 10% 15 years ago. Further information: Lex van Vorselen, Amsterdam, (31) (20) 6763646 NEW ZEALAND Human Rights Act amended Following the outcry over the Act's requirement to ban spouse's pensions (see Headlines of December 1994), the Government has amended the Act. Although the new amendment clarifies the question of spouse's pensions, it also raises new questions by introducing a provision allowing dependants' benefits. For example, does the ability to provide a dependant's benefit mean that a scheme can, in future, provide a spouse's benefit? The amendment states that spouse's pensions can continue for all future benefits for existing members and new entrants up until 31 December 1995. Furthermore, the deadline for amending schemes for the new legislation has now been extended until December 1995. When considering making amendments, scheme sponsors and trustees will need to consider to what extent they provide different benefits to members who joined pre and post 31 December 1995. Further information: Mark Weaver, Wellington, (64) (4) 4990277 SOUTH AFRICA Interim recommendations of tax commission released The interim report of the Katz Commission of Inquiry into certain aspects of the tax structure of South Africa (see Headlines of December 1994) was released on 9 December 1994. The recommendations that affect retirement funds are: Employee contributions to pension funds which qualify for tax relief will continue to be limited to 7.5% of pensionable income, but it is proposed that a 'cap' of SAR 9,000 pa be placed on such contributions. Any additional contributions over the 'cap' would not be tax-deductible. It is further proposed that tax-deductible employer contributions to pension funds be limited to twice the aggregate of employees' (capped) contributions. The implication from the report is that employers will not be able to obtain tax deductions for company contributions if their pension funds do not require employee contributions. No change to the provisions governing defined contribution provident funds (funds where the full benefit is payable as a lump sum) is proposed. These funds are perceived to be 'fiscally privileged savings accounts' rather than genuine retirement funds. Defined benefit provident funds are, however, targeted for attention, with the proposal that employer contributions be denied tax-deductibility status. The limit on retirement annuity fund contributions is to increase from 15% to 22.5% of non-pensionable net income for all taxpayers. Such contributions will be subject to a 'cap' of SAR 27,000 pa. Employer contributions to medical aid funds (private health care provision indemnity-type plans) are to remain tax-deductible. It is certain that the recommendations contained in the interim report will be challenged, particularly as they are inconsistent in many respects and vague in others. For instance, they seem to imply that defined benefit pension funds may be a threatened species, if for no other reason than that employers will encounter problems in funding deficits and meeting escalating costs as a result of AIDS, because of an absolute limit on tax-deductible employer contributions. There is also no indication as to how the proposed 'caps' will be revised in the future. At this stage, no immediate action on the basis of the comission's proposals is recommended, as the inconsistencies apparent in the proposals make it unlikely that they will remain unchanged. The Government's desire to implement at least some of the other recommendations of the commission in the 1995/1996 Budget in March 1995 does require constant vigilance, however. Further information: Ian Patrick, Johannesburg, (27) (11) 6373610 SWEDEN Companies may be exempt from social security contributions The Swedish Government has announced its intention of launching a programme in early 1995 aimed at reducing the number of unemployed workers. Although all the details have not yet been made public, one important feature of the programme is that companies may be exempt from statutory social security contributions for a period of one year if they hire an unemployed person. The employer's social security contribution is 32.86% of taxable earnings. Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 6541700 Tax on pension plan contributions increased With effect from 1 January 1995, the special tax levied on company contributions to pension plans was increased by 3.5%. The increase means that the total tax rate is now 21.39%. Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 6541700 UNITED KINGDOM Pensions Bill published The Government published the Pensions Bill on 15 December 1994. It contains provisions concerning protection measures, trustees, limited price indexation (LPI), equal treatment, winding-up, and State pensions and contracting-out. The Government estimates that the cost of complying with the Bill will be approximately �500 million a year. These costs will bear most heavily on traditional final salary schemes which are affected by the introduction of LPI and the minimum solvency requirement(MSR). In relation to the MSR, employers, trustees, and actuaries will have to: ensure that disclosures of MSR solvency are not misinterpreted by scheme members decide what, if any, implications the MSR will have, and decide what measure and level of solvency is appropriate for their scheme. The key points of the Bill � all of which take effect from April 1997 � are summarised below. Protection measures: A new pensions regulator, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA), will be appointed to replace the Occupational Pensions Board and will be given extensive additional powers. Defined benefit schemes will be subject to a minimum solvency requirement based on cash equivalents for active and deferred members and buy-out costs for pensioners (with exceptions for large schemes). A Pensions Compensation Board will be established to meet losses from fraud, theft and misappropriation. Trustees: All schemes are to have one-third of trustees appointed by the members, unless an alternative proposal is not rejected by members and pensioners; a statutory consultation procedure will be specified in regulations. The scheme auditor and actuary (and individuals, firm, and companies connected with them) are to be banned from being trustees. Certain trustee powers and responsibilities specified in statute (eg investment, schedule of company contributions, dispute resolution procedure) will override scheme rules. Professional advisers must be appointed by the trustees; the actuary and auditor will have a 'whistle blowing' duty. Indexation: Pensions in respect of service completed or contributions paid after April 1997 will increase in payment at 5% pa or retail price index(RPI) if less (LPI). LPI will apply to money purchase schemes and appropriate personal pensions. Equal treatment: All schemes are to provide equal access and equal benefits for men and women, in line with European Court judgments. Winding-up: A statutory order of priorities will apply on winding-up, overriding scheme rules. This order relegates all increases to pensions in payment to a lower priority than currently applies and so effectively reduces the security given to pensioners. State pensions and contracting-out: Guaranteed minimum pensions (GMPs) will be replaced by a new contracting-out test based on 80ths of earnings, with earnings defined as 90% of the average of the last three years' earnings between the upper and lower earnings limits. Age-related National Insurance contribution rebates will be introduced for contracted-out money purchase schemes and personal pensions. The amount of pension drawn from protected rights under a personal pension can be varied each year, between age 60 and age 75, between nothing and annuity amount.240 From 2020, state pension age will be equalised at age 65 for men and women, with phasing in from the year 2010. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (71) 3794411 UNITED STATES GATT legislation makes key pension changes In addition to its much-debated trade provisions, the recently enacted legislation ratifying the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)makes some significant changes in the rules for tax-qualified pension plans in the United States. For example, the measure includes a number of provisions designed to correct problems with under-funded defined benefit plans. Specific changes include tighter minimum funding standards and higher variable rate pension insurance premiums for many under-funded plans. These changes pose significant financial implications for some companies. Note, however, that well-funded plans generally escape the tighter funding rules and higher pension insurance premiums imposed by the GATT law. Such plans, in fact, will benefit from a number of provisions, including one that eliminates the quarterly payment requirement for employer contributions and another that changes the interest assumptions employers must use in calculating minimum lump sums from defined benefit pensions. This latter change will result in smaller pay-outs from plans that provide unsubsidised lump sums. The law also extends for five years the rules permitting transfers of surplus pension assets to special sub-accounts set up within pension plans to pay retiree health benefits. Those rules had been scheduled to expire in 1995. Further information: Jim Durfee, Valhalla, (1) (914) 7454286 Comprehensive health reform stalls in Washington Twelve months ago, it looked like 1994 would be the year of health care reform in Washington. In the light of the November 1994 election results and the recent leadership change in Congress, however, it's clear that no comprehensive overhaul of the US health care system will emerge from Capitol Hill in the foreseeable future. While the new Congress will surely return to the health care issue in 1995, it now appears that only incremental reforms (eg insurance reform)stand much chance of being enacted. One likely upshot of Washington's failure to act on the issue will be increased legislative activity at the state level. A few states have already enacted sweeping reforms designed to expand coverage for uninsured residents, and many more state legislatures have been waiting to see what Congress might do before taking action on their own. One problem for some states has been the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which generally pre-empts state laws regulating self-insured employer health plans. Now that comprehensive reform at the federal level appears unlikely, there's a chance Congress could scale back ERISA's preemption clause in 1995 to give the states more room to experiment with health reform. This could create significant health plan design, administration and compliance headaches for employers with operations in a number of states. In addition, employers who have been waiting for federal action on health reform will now want to give renewed attention to two key issues that some had hoped would be addressed by federal legislation: ways to control the growth of health benefit costs, which many expect will accelerate once again now that the threat of federal health reform has evaporated, and approaches for measuring and managing the quality and effectiveness of the health care delivery arrangements offered to employees and their families.

In spite of strenuous efforts by the European Commission, cross-border pensions mobility has remained elusive. The Commission's attempts to achieve cross-border freedoms of pension fund management services, pension fund investment and pension membership have, over recent years, been stalled by objections from member states. The most recent disappointment was the withdrawal of the EU Directive on pension fund investment (see Headlines of August 1994). The last sign of progress was the ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 28 January 1992 in the case of Bachmann v Belgium. The implication of this ruling was that it is illegal to tax contributions to a company pension plan based in another EU state in a different way from those paid to a locally approved plan. However, two developments this year mean that pensions mobility may be moving back up the agenda. The first concerns the ECJ's ruling on 14 February in the case of Finanzamt K�ln-Altstadt v Roland Schumacker. The court decided that national income tax regimes must be exercised consistently with EU law, in spite of the fact that direct taxation does not currently fall within the jurisdiction of the EU. Mr. Schumacker is a Belgian national who works in Germany but lives in Belgium. He was taxed in Germany as a non-resident and was therefore not entitled to certain allowances. He claimed that he should be treated no less favourably under the German tax regime than a German resident. Having decided that national tax regimes have be exercised consistently with Union law, the court insisted that the free movement rules of the Treaty of Rome required the abolition of discrimination based on nationality between workers of different member states. The European Commission had issued a Recommendation in December 1993 which, although not binding on member states, was intended to encourage member states to adopt legislation to eliminate discrimination in personal income tax between residents and non-residents. The ruling of the ECJ in this case follows the principle of the Recommendation.Although this case has no direct application to pension plans, the principle could equally well be applied to argue that existing tax barriers to cross-border pensions mobility within the EU are unlawful. Some double tax treaties between member states (for example between the UK and France)already go some way towards recognising pensions in each other's jurisdiction for tax purposes. It may be that other member states will follow suit in the light of this case and the EU Recommendation. The second development concerns the inclusion of measures to ensure the portability of pensions across member states in the Commission's 1995 work programme. A draft migrant workers directive had already been published in November 1994. This has now been replaced by a working document which indicates a slower timetable. While this acknowledges that problems still lie ahead, it also shows that the Commission is determined to ensure that, in the long term, the movement of workers within the EU should not have a detrimental effect on their pensions. Although pan-European pensions are still a long way off, progress� of one sort or another� is definitely being made. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 3794411 AUSTRALIA Tax law on overseas funds changed With effect from 1 July 1994, individuals will only have a six-month period from becoming a tax resident in Australia to transfer their overseas retirement benefits into an Australian fund tax-free. If the amount is not transferred within this period, there may be a tax implication for the individuals in the tax year in which the amount actually comes into Australia. Growth in the benefits from the time they become tax residents of Australia to the date the amount enters the country is deemed to be assessable income of the individuals and is taxed at their personal marginal tax rate in the year the amount comes into Australia. There is also a change to the ability of Australian employers to gain tax deduction for most contributions to overseas superannuation funds for Australian resident workers. Such contributions are now both non-deductible for tax purposes and subject to fringe benefits tax. Previously, the amounts were deductible and exempt from fringe benefits tax. Further information: Kirk Sutton or Tony Nemec, Sydney, (61) (2) 2295111 BELGIUM Appointed actuaries introduced Following a Royal Decree issued at the end of 1994, pension funds have to appoint one or more actuaries to be consulted on matters of funding, technical reserves and reinsurance. Details of the appointed actuary or actuaries, who must satisfy certain requirements (eg EU national, minimum of five years' experience), have to be lodged with the Insurance Control Authorities (CDV/OCA) before 31 March 1995. Pension funds already had to file an actuarial statement each year that was signed by an 'actuary' but the latter was not officially appointed and did not have to satisfy any requirements. Further information: Geert De Ridder, Brussels, (32) (2) 676 1811 Sex equality in pension plans implemented The Belgian Insurance Control Authorities (CDV/OCA) have issued a communication, dated 20 January 1995, regarding the harmonisation of pension plans in the context of EU legislation on sex discrimination. The following procedures are imposed: Pension funds that seek approval of the amended plan from the CDV/OCA must outline in a covering letter how the modifications satisfy EU requirements. Insurance companies that are only subject to the control a posteriori have to make an internal file note on behalf of their clients with group insurance contracts. If the plan amendments reduce benefits for certain categories of employees, the accrued benefits at the date of modification have to be guaranteed. Plans that are not yet amended must already be financed on the basis that the more favourable benefits apply to all categories of employees for years of service after 17 May 1990 (cf the levelling-up principle). Finally, the control authorities have stated that they can make a reservation for all plan improvements which fall outside the scope of the Barber case (see the article about the salary freeze outlined in the global plan in Headlines of April 1994). Clearly, companies that have not yet brought their plans into line with EU legislation should do so as quickly as possible. Further information: Geert De Ridder, Brussels, (32) (2) 676 1811 Social security contribution on pensions introduced With effect from 1 January 1995, the global plan introduced a progressive social security contribution on all pension income (see Headlines of June 1994). A Royal Decree issued at the end of 1994 gives more details: Pensions in payment as well as lump sums paid since October 1980, of national or foreign origin, state-provided or not, are subject to the new contribution. For the purpose of calculating the contribution, lump sums must be converted into pensions, based on actuarial factors already in use for similar conversions under occupational accident insurance in the public sector. The contribution rate varies from 0.5% to 2% depending on gross income level and family situation. The national sickness and disability institute (INAMI/ RIZIV) is responsible for the calculation of the contribution which is withheld from the state pension. Further information: Christine Dombret, Brussels, (32) (2) 67618 11 Unfunded or internally funded pension promises no longer permitted? On 16 June 1994, the Court of Appeal of Ghent ruled that internal reserves for pension promises are tax-deductible. This was good news as the judgment not only seemed to justify and confirm internal reserves but even recognised that they qualify as tax-deductible expenses. However, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economic Affairs, in their reply to a parliamentary question on the subject, adopted a strict interpretation of the General Insurance Law. According to this interpretation, all collective and individual pension promises have to be externally funded. And it was specified that only group insurances, pension funds and individual insurance contracts could be retained as external funding vehicles. The status of individual pension promises is currently unclear and requires clarification. The question is whether, in practice, internal promises remain permissible and whether so-called 'keymen insurances' ('assurances dirigeant d'entreprise'/'bedrijfsleidersverzekeringen') qualify as external funding vehicles for such promises. For the time being and until the relevant authorities issue clear regulations, companies that have introduced individual promises do not seem to have a compelling reason to alter their arrangements. Further information: Marcel Rottiers, Brussels, (32) (2) 676 1811 BRAZIL Benefit trends highlighted The Towers Perrin 1994 survey of corporate benefit trends in Brazil reveals that 48% of the 308 participating companies operate a formal pension plan. The vast majority of these use defined contribution or hybrid plans. This is mainly because they give companies increased flexibility and reduce longer-term risks. The other benefits most commonly provided are medical care, meal allowances and group life insurance, with more than 80% of participating companies providing at least one of these benefits. The full pattern of corporate benefit provision is shown in the chart below. Further information: Andr�a Fontes, Rio de Janeiro, (55) (21) 224 7982 ITALY Pension reform back on track? Mr. Tiziano Treu, the recently appointed Labour Minister, is working towards defining the broad outlines of reforms for Italy's bloated pension system. Talks with union representatives have begun amid turmoil in the financial markets. Pressure from these markets has meant that Mr. Treu has been set a tight deadline of the end of March 1995 for reporting on his progress. Doubtless there will be lively discussions over the following weeks, and the deadline of the end of March will probably prove optimistic. Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (1727)846161 JAPAN Pension deregulation continues The pensions environment is being deregulated with beneficial effects. Funded pension plans have been highly regulated. A key investment regulation has been the 5:3:3:2 rule which applies separately to each fund manager: Since April 1990, this regulation has been partially eased so that (2), (3) and (4) are exempted for large employee pension funds (EPFs� retirement funds which are contracted out of earnings-related social security), allowing the use of investment advisory firms. However, several related restrictions concerning exemption have been introduced: Eligible EPFs have to have existed for at least eight years. Investment advisory firms can only manage funds accumulated after they have been approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The funds must not exceed one-third of total assets.Key recent changes for EPFs are as follows: The contribution abatement for contracted-out benefits was increased from 3.2% to 3.5% from November 1994, and will vary by EPF experience from 3.2% to 3.8% from March 1996. Restrictions on assets which are accumulated after a date approved by the government (the earliest approved date is 1 April 1990) for purposes of partial exemption from the 5:3:3:2 rule have been eliminated since November 1994. In addition, the eight years' requirement will be relaxed to three years. The mortality rates which must be used in EPF actuarial valuations will be revised on 1 April 1995 to reflect increased longevity and therefore increased pension costs. EPFs will be required to develop written investment policy statements, including investment objectives and asset allocation, in order to take advantage of the partial exemption from the 5:3:3:2 rule from April 1996. The government will implement market value-related accounting in lieu of the current book value system by 1997 at the latest. Further information: Tetsuo Tohno, Tokyo, (81) (3) 35815731 NEW ZEALAND New disclosure regime published The second report from the government working party considering the information which trustees and companies must provide to superannuation scheme members was published recently. As well as corporate-sponsored superannuation, the working party has considered most investment products available to the average New Zealander. In line with New Zealand's tax-neutral savings regime, it is proposed that corporate superannuation be subject to the same disclosure requirements as other savings products. If the current proposal is not changed to exempt corporate superannuation, schemes will have more onerous future reporting requirements for new members and annual trustee reports. It is expected that the local industry body, the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand (ASFONZ), will lobby hard for major changes to the current proposal. At a time when there is substantial renewed interest by employers in their superannuation and benefit programmes, it would be a mistake if further government legislation discouraged this interest. The latest ASFONZ benefits survey is due to be published shortly.

The proposed 'cap' on tax-deductible employee and employer contributions to pension funds, as well as on contributions to retirement annuity funds, was not forthcoming. The proposals had drawn sharp criticism and debate from many quarters following the release of the Commission's report. The Minister acknowledged that this debate had highlighted various other issues regarding retirement benefit provision. The government is of the view that the matter should be pursued further in an holistic manner, with consideration being given to issues other than taxation. No changes beyond those discussed below can be implemented until further work has been done; this will be undertaken in close co-operation with the Katz Commission. Tax avoidance measures using the lump sums payable from pension and provident funds have been curtailed. Lump sums will, in future, not be considered as part of non-retirement funding income, and hence the ability of individuals to make significant tax-deductible retirement annuity contributions in the year of retirement to reduce taxable income is largely removed. In addition, if the average rate of tax in the year of accrual of the lump sum benefit is less than that in the previous year, the prior year's rate will be used. The tax-free status of lump sums payable from public sector retirement funds was not modified in the budget, and continues to be one of the most glaring anomalies in the taxation treatment of retirement funds. The budget speech makes clear reference to the constitutional imperative of no discrimination in respect of gender or marital status. Such issues were addressed in part in the budget. With tax reform leading the way in this regard, it is probably fair to say that it is only a matter of time before other areas are also addressed, with definite implications for retirement funds.

The legislation concerns redundancy and probationary periods. Redundancy: It is no longer possible for companies to exempt two 'highly-valued' employees from the last-in-first-out (LIFO) order of termination of employment. Probationary periods: The maximum initial probationary period is once again six months (reduced from one year). Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 6541700 UNITED KINGDOM Executive pay review body established The employers' federation, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), has announced the formation of a study group on directors' remuneration (the Greenbury committee). It will be composed of leading industrialists and institutional shareholder representatives and will be chaired by Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks & Spencer. This initiative is in response to growing controversy over the level of executive pay, particularly in the privatised industries. Shortly after the CBI group was announced, the Institute of Directors(IoD) published its own guidelines on the subject. These recommended that: remuneration committees should weigh up a number of considerations (such as performance, responsibilities, risk, market comparisons) when deciding upon directors' remuneration, and there should be greater disclosure of pay packages. As the CBI group will not report until later this year, the IoD's recommendations will not be the final word on the subject. But the IoD is a member of the Greenbury committee, and the committee will seriously consider the IoD's points. The committee will also examine share options and the length of executive contracts. Although the outcome of the committee's wider deliberations is unknown, it is safe to predict that greater disclosure will be a main recommendation. Companies wishing to get an idea of the degree of detail that may be expected should look at the 1994 accounts of BOC and Grand Metropolitan, which are the definition of current best practice.

As recently as 1993, most US employers were experiencing double-digit cost in-creases for their employee and retiree health plans. At less than 2% for almost every type of health plan for active employees, the average 1995 cost increase reported by the 145 large employers participating in the survey was the smallest in the six years Towers Perrin has been tracking employer health care cost trends. What's more, the average 1995 cost for health maintenance organisations (HMOs)� pre-paid health plans that provide comprehensive services for a pre-determined annual premium� actually declined from reported 1994 levels by a little over 1%. Retiree medical cost increases also slowed dramatically among the employers surveyed� to about 3% this year. Last year, by contrast, employers were seeing retiree health care cost increases approaching 10% on average. Clearly, intensifying competition in the US health care marketplace and the positive effects of managed care are helping US employers control costs. However, in light of the cyclical pattern of health care cost movements over the last 20 years, it remains to be seen how long this good news will last. Moreover, given that employee and retiree health benefits still represent a large share of total remuneration costs� and more than 26% of overall benefit costs according to the latest US Chamber of Commerce benefit survey� effective health plan management will likely remain a key goal in most US companies for the foreseeable future. Further information: Bill Falk, Chicago, (1) (312) 6099354 FASB backs away from stock option expensing For the past few years, many companies have been working to head off a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) proposal that would have required them to recognise an accounting expense for stock options and other forms of stock-based remuneration. Opponents of FASB's proposal scored an important victory recently as the Board decided to drop its proposed expensing requirements. Instead, FASB has decided to give companies a choice between recognising a remuneration expense for stock-based programmes or continuing to follow current rules, which generally do not require expense recognition. However, those taking the latter approach would be required to disclose in footnotes what the impact of expensing would have been on net income and earnings per share. While few companies are likely to choose the first alternative (expense recognition), most see the disclosure-only option as a burden in its own right. And some fear expanded footnote disclosure is just a prelude to another move towards expensing in the future.

The opportunity will arise once the Internal RevenueService (IRS) finalises regulations under Section 404A of the InternalRevenue Code. From the date of issue of the regulations, companies willhave one year to make elections that will allow them to take tax deductionsfor contributions and accruals under foreign branch plans -- or obtain taxcredits for plans of foreign subsidiaries -- for some or all open taxyears. Some companies are taking the opportunity now to briefly analysetheir 404A position, in preparation for the one-year rush. Companies which fail to act within the year will have lost the opportunityforever to make the election for all previous tax years. In future,multinationals will be able to make the election for each tax year,although, once made, the election can be changed only with IRS consent.Fortunately, the decision to elect or not can usually be made on the basisof a simple cost/benefit analysis once the right data has been identified. US tax law generally disallows deductions for foreign pension expenseunless the foreign plans meet US tax-deductibility standards -- which fewdo. Thanks to 404A, however, US multinationals that elect to do so cantake tax deductions or obtain foreign tax credits. For some companies, a 404A election will produce significant taxadvantages: US multinationals with foreign branch operations shouldgenerally elect, for example. But companies that operate through a networkof subsidiaries might not need the deductions or foreign tax credits (eg ifthey're not profitable in certain foreign locations, or if they have taxlosses that are being carried forward). In addition, some foreign plansmay be too small to be material. The right choice may not be obvious. While organisations are more likelyto benefit from 404A if their foreign operations are profitable, a 404Aelection could also produce tax advantages if they're reorganising,selling, or liquidating foreign operations. Once the regulations become final, there will probably be an increase inIRS audit activity. Thus, companies which make a 404A election should bearmed with the appropriate analyses that will support their claims to theIRS for any deductions/credits for foreign pension contributions oraccruals. Already, companies without appropriate documentation are seeingtheir deductions reversed.

The main provisions of the new law, which affectboth insured plans and pension funds, are: Discrimination: There must be no discrimination: among employees within the same category between men and women with respect to service after 17 May 1990, and against part-time employees. Eligibility: Plan membership must be immediate for employees at least 25years old. Vesting: Retirement benefits must vest after one year ofservice. (Previously, the only vesting requirements were for insuredplans, where vesting after five years of plan membership was replaced byimmediate vesting on 1 January 1993.) The law describes how the vestedbenefit should be calculated and how and when it should be communicated tomembers. Transfer of benefit entitlement: Employees with vested benefits must begiven the right to transfer them to either the pension plan of their newemployer, or to an insurance company operating on a non-profit basis, inaccordance with the provisions of an old Royal Decree dated 14 May 1969.(Currently, there are only a very few insurers that are actively offeringthis facility.) Introduction, modification and discontinuance of a pension plan: Althoughemployer control is explicitly confirmed in the law, a collective labouragreement will be required to these actions, if the plan: is contributory, and applies to all employees. Employee participation: The works council or, in its absence, the healthand safety committee must have the right to give its opinion on: the choice of a pension institution or the change to another one the financing of the plan the determination of the reserves the annual communication of the vested rights the transfer of pension liabilities, and the application, interpretation and modification of the plan rules. If, as is often the case, the pension plan does not cover all employees,the above rights may be given to the members of the works council or thehealth and safety committee who are also plan members. Small companieswithout works councils or health and safety committees are required toinform the employees themselves, prior to reaching any decision in theareas listed above. (For employers with insured plans, any form ofemployee participation is brand new and will come as an unpleasantsurprise.) Transitional rules: Except for the general statement that benefits andtransfers of corresponding reserves for service prior to 1 January 1996 mayonly be requested by plan participants in as much as reserves have actuallybeen built up, transitional rules for existing plans will follow by RoyalDecree.

Some member states (eg France with the UK, France with the Netherlands, theUK with Denmark) already have provisions in their double taxation treatiesthat give tax exemptions for employees temporarily working in one of thestates for continued membership of a pension plan in the other state. Itis possible that the Commission will seek the inclusion of similarprovisions in other double taxation treaties. Finally, the Commission has again confirmed that it intends to take courtaction against member states that impose restrictions on overseasinvestment of domestic pension fund assets (see Headlines of December1994), reinforcing its commitment to liberalising pension fund assetswithin the EU. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 ITALY Private pension plans to become reality Following a series of unsuccessful attempts, the Italian Government has nowissued draft legislation to introduce significant tax incentives forprivate defined contribution pension provision. This draft legislation isexpected to be passed by Parliament within the next two months and is notexpected to be subject to major amendment. Companies with employees in Italy should now finally prepare to reviewtheir retirement policy. In particular: Employers with an existing plan should review the implications for both existing employees and future hires. Employers with no plan should consider their retirement policy in the context of competitive practice. In formulating their retirement policy, companies will need to take intoaccount the following: Social security benefits are also currently being reviewed. There is uncertainty about the extent and timing of the changes, but there is little doubt that benefit levels will decrease. This is expected to shift the emphasis to supplementary pension provision, as has already occurred in most other developed countries. Many existing company plans are defined benefit arrangements which the final law may encourage, after a transitionary period, to be converted to defined contribution. Termination indemnities (so-called TFR benefits) will now need to be financed partly by paying cash contributions to the company pension plan, where one exists. Up to now, most companies have financed all termination indemnities by accruing a book reserve on the company balance sheet. Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (1727) 846161 Agreement reached on social security pension reform The Government and powerful labour union representatives have reachedagreement on far-reaching reform measures for the troubled Italian socialsecurity pension system. The key changes include: a conversion of the existing defined benefit system to a new defined contribution system a gradual move away from the current over-generous system whereby individuals can retire early with an immediate unreduced pension after making social security contributions for 35 years a gradual removal of sex discriminatory retirement ages, and an increase in social security contribution rates. The employers' association, also present at the negotiations, refused tosign the agreement, criticising it for implementing the changes too slowly.The agreement is, however, now being discussed in Parliament where,although there appears to be broad political support, significant debate isexpected.

The Nikkeiren figure is based onactual increases among 299 major Japanese firms. Although Japanese firms' performance is recovering -- especially thehigh-tech sector -- a combination of low CPI increases in the Tokyo area(0.4% for fiscal year 1994), the Hanshin earthquake, yen appreciation andthe 'NTT shock' have resulted in the lowest settlement of 2.8%. The 'NTT shock' reflects the strong influence of Nippon Telegraph andTelephone on employer and employee attitudes. NTT has the largest in-houseunion with 280,000 members. This year they agreed about one month earlierthan usual to settle at 2.8% -- possibly reflecting union concerns aboutjob security and restraint in the coming division spin-off into 'babyBells' -- a similar situation to that which occurred under UStelecommunications deregulation over a decade ago. Towers Perrin survey data on 100 non-Japanese-owned, major multinationalfirms indicates that 1995 base salary increases in major multinationalcompanies are 3.5% --running somewhat higher than in major Japanese firms.

This penalty was intended to reduce the use of the WAOsystem by imposing fines up to a maximum amount of the annual salary of anyemployee discharged in this way. At the same time, a related bonus waspaid to companies that hired WAO beneficiaries who had previously beendeclared unfit for work. This bonus system will also be scrapped from thesame date. Meanwhile, the SER, the principal advisory board on social and economicaffairs, has unanimously rejected the Government's proposal to abolish thecash sickness benefits programme and to 'contract-out' of the disabilityprogrammes (see Headlines of October 1994), because it believes that theopting-out mechanism will be even more expensive than the current system.This move has not deterred the Government from pursuing its plans toprivatise sickness insurance and modify general and occupational disabilitywith effect from 1 January 1996. Further information: Lex van Vorselen, Amsterdam,(31)(20)676 3646 POLAND Sickness benefits changed The Polish Parliament (Sejm) has approved a change to the rules governingsickness benefit. The new rules, which came into effect on 1 March 1995,will put financial pressure on employers (apart from those with less thanfive employees who are exempt for a one-year period) to try and reduce theamount of sick leave taken by their employees. Under the new rules, employees receive 80% of their normal pay (defined asaverage earnings over the six months preceding sickness) during the first(not necessarily consecutive) 35 days of sickness. This amount is payableirrespective of the employee's length of service. After the first 35 days,sickness benefits are paid out of social security. Previously, socialsecurity paid benefits for up to 26 weeks of sickness, depending on lengthof employment. The benefit varied between 75% and 100% of average earnings(75% for less than three years' employment and 100% for eight and more).

The old method based the imputed value of the benefit on theamount of personal mileage travelled per year. This approach took no account of the value of the car. The new rules,effective January 1994, apply a taxable benefit based on both the cost ofthe car and personal mileage. This change partially closes a tax loopholeand is consistent with the Government's policy to limit the number of carsin Singapore. In the case of a high value car such as a Mercedes 280, the annual taxablebenefit to the employee has increased from S$1,000 under the old rules toS$11,500 under the new rules. Clearly, older cars will carry a lower imputed value. Despite the highertax liability, employers have chosen not to subsidise the higher taxes fortheir employees. The new tax treatment has, however, made the payment ofcash car allowances a more attractive alternative to providing a companycar.

In addition, monies paid out of the fund to terminating employees asa result of retirement (at least age 55 and five years' participation inthe provident fund), medically certified disability or death are nowreceived tax-free. Further information: Heather McNab, Singapore, (65)221 3588 UNITED KINGDOM Lords amend Pensions Bill The Pensions Bill has completed its progress through the House of Lords andwill now be debated in the House of Commons. The Government has acceptedthat the Bill will need to be changed in four areas: Description of the minimum solvency requirement: This has been renamed asthe minimum funding requirement (MFR). This more accurately reflects thescope of the proposals which only effectively provide for a minimum levelof contribution to defined benefit plans with no guarantees on wind-up. Recognition of pension rights on divorce: The Government has had to accepttwo changes. The first requires courts to recognise pension assets indivorce settlements. The second means that scheme trustees can be orderedto pay part of a member's pension to a divorced spouse when it comes intopayment. This will present many practical problems for schemeadministrators and impose additional costs. Power to determine the employers contribution rate: The Bill will beamended in the Commons so that trustees cannot set a contribution rateabove the rate necessary to meet the MFR without employer consent. In itsinitial form, the Bill would have given trustees this power. Definition of accrued rights: The Bill's definition of these rights (whichmust be protected on plan amendment) is ambiguous in the context of adefined benefit pension scheme. The Government has therefore agreed toconsult with the pensions industry to produce a more accurate definition. Although the Government's flexible attitude to change is encouraging, theamendments concerning divorce have not been clearly thought through andmore work is needed. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 Tax rules hit offshore retirement plans Employers should review their policies and objectives for providingretirement benefits for international transfers, following recentlyannounced changes in UK tax rules. These affect: members of non-UK plans who work in the UK, and members of UK retirement plans who work temporarily outside the UK. Effective 23 February 1995, the tax authorities have tightened up theirrules for granting 'corresponding approval'. This allows certain employeesworking in the UK to receive broadly the same tax advantages given to UKtax-approved plans: primarily, the employee is exempt from UK tax onemployer contributions to the plan and obtains tax relief on his/her owncontributions. Essentially, the authorities will only grant these concessions in futurefor genuine retirement benefit arrangements in the employee's home countryand providing that specific benefit and contribution conditions aresatisfied. It appears that the main targets for these changes are offshore plans',particularly those based in 'tax havens'. It remains to be seen whatcriteria the UK tax authorities will impose for 'corresponding approval' inthe future. Other changes have been announced that will extend the period for whichemployees can remain members of UK plans when they go to work overseas.However, companies need to be aware that continued membership may haveadverse tax implications for the company and the employee, and shouldtherefore consider these relaxations in the context of their overall policyfor expatriate management. Further information: Val Vardy, London,(44)(171) 379 4411 UNITED STATES Survey finds employer efforts help employees prepare for retirement A new Towers Perrin survey of 1,000 working Americans provides clearevidence that employer efforts to educate employees about the importance ofplanning and saving for retirement are starting to pay off. Compared withthe results of a similar survey we conducted in 1991, the new survey showsthat about twice as many employees are actively planning -- and moreemployees are actually saving -- for retirement than just a few years ago.The need for employees to save for retirement is growing as a result oflonger life expectancies, changing employment patterns (eg more frequent'job hopping' and breaks in pension service) and the ongoing shift inemphasis from defined benefit pension plans towards employee savings planssuch as 401(k)s, among other factors. Despite these positive trends, the survey also suggests that many employeesstill have unrealistic expectations about retirement and lack theunderstanding of investment and capital accumulation strategies needed toput their savings to work. These findings suggest that employer efforts toeducate employees about retirement planning, while beneficial, need to gofarther. It may be time, for example, for employers to rethink their reluctance tocommunicate with employees about the basics of investing and investmentstrategy. Without such assistance, many of today's employees could findthemselves having to work longer than they'd planned or see their vision ofretirement give way to less appealing realities.

Indeed, more than 95% of the companies surveyed now offer one or moreexecutive plans, with supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) beingthe most common. Defined benefit SERPs, offered by 94% of theparticipants, are by far the most popular, although more companies thanever are offering executive-only savings plans that aren't subject to thestringent 401(k) tax rules. About a third of the companies offer executivelife insurance programmes, and a quarter offer supplemental long-termdisability plans for executives. Given that the vast majority of SERPs are merely unfunded promises to paybenefits and the growing importance these plans are taking on as thebenefits available to executives under qualified plans have been curtailed,it's not surprising that another recent Towers Perrin survey found benefitsecurity issues to be a top concern among companies that offerexecutive-only retirement arrangements. These and other trends are coveredin depth in the recently published Handbook of Executive Benefits (IrwinProfessional Publishing), written by a number of Towers Perrin consultants.

Participants in and observers of this debate will be interested in the report of the Greenbury committee, the UK group of leading industrialists and institutional investors headed by the chairman of Marks & Spencer, Sir Richard Greenbury (see Headlines of April 1995). The committee published its code of best practice for determining directors' remuneration on 17 July 1995. The code and report consider the full range of issues surrounding executive pay and are likely to have a significant impact on company practice. The key points are: increased accountability to shareholders for directors' remuneration through full disclosure and a new code of best practice Stock Exchange invited to oblige listed companies to make full disclosure and an annual statement to shareholders about compliance with the code remuneration committees consisting exclusively of non-executive directors to determine remuneration policy and packages of individual executive directors annual reports to shareholders by remuneration committees to include full disclosure of company's remuneration policy and all elements in the remuneration packages of each individual director by name disclosure to include pension entitlements earned during the year, calculated on a basis to be recommended by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries remuneration committee reports to form a self-contained section in or annexed to the annual report and accounts chairman of remuneration committee to attend company's AGM to answer questions about directors' remuneration remuneration committees' annual reports to shareholders not to be a standard AGM agenda item; but committees to consider each year whether circumstances are such that AGM should be invited to approve company's remuneration policies annual bonuses for directors to be subject to challenging performance criteria; part payment in shares to be considered; remuneration committee reports to justify any pensionability of bonuses if applicable all long-term incentive schemes, not just share option schemes, to be specifically approved by share-holders, whether payable in shares or cash long-term incentive schemes and traditional share options to be carefully weighed against each other, and preferably one or the other chosen as the means of rewarding outstanding performance; grants and rewards under all such schemes, including future grants under existing schemes, to be subject to challenging performance criteria option grants to be phased rather than awarded in one large block discounting of executive share option grants to be stopped government recommended to abolish present tax concessions for executive share options long-term shareholdings by directors in their companies to be encouraged compensation payments for loss of office to be reduced through shorter notice periods in contracts; periods above one year to be justified to shareholders; robust line to be taken on payment of compensation when performance has been unsatisfactory companies to consider phasing compensation payments and stopping them when the recipient is re-employed privatised water and energy companies to review existing remuneration packages, including share options, adjust them on a voluntary basis as necessary and make a full report for discussion by shareholders at first available AGM in future privatisations, no grants to be made under any share option schemes for at least six months, and preferably a year or more, after flotation. The committee has reached some unexpected conclusions. One-year contracts, the abolition of income tax relief on executive share options and shareholder approval of all longer-term incentives are surprising proposals. However, the report is a positive contribution which will assist companies in setting their directors' remuneration. Although it makes a number of specific suggestions, companies should make their own judgements in deciding what is appropriate for them.

On the basis of a review of the proxies of 70 large companies, fears that disclosure would drive pay levels upwards appear largely unfounded. Median salary increases for CEOs were 5%, and 25% of the CEOs in this group did not receive any increase during 1994. While real increases are high because of the low inflation environment, they are hardly excessive for a year of strong recovery. The average bonus paid to CEOs in this group increased by 60% over 1993 levels, but this was not surprising since corporate profits increased three-fold over the same period. A number of companies also paid special bonuses to executives involved in significant acquisitions or restructuring. There were no major changes in the size of stock option grants over the previous year, but a small but growing number of companies have introduced performance features into their stock option arrangements. This trend mirrors the experience of US companies following introduction of the new disclosure rules in 1992.

Until the areas of doubt are clarified, employers should continue to operate their plans on the basis of the ECJ's rulings. The proposed Directive omits many of the concessions which the ECJ has allowed for in recent decisions, including: unequal bridging pensions sex-based actuarial factors for converting one type of benefit to another in defined benefit plans. If the proposed Directive is adopted in this form, all member states in the EU will be required to introduce legislation to implement its provisions, which would appear to prohibit the concessions that have specifically been allowed by the ECJ. Employers will then have to comply with their domestic law and could be in breach of that law if they operate their plans to include any of these concessions. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 Commission backs away from legal action In spite of the European Commission's repeated statements that it will take court action against member states that impose restrictions on overseas investment of domestic pension fund assets (see Headlines of December 1994), it now believes that it has found an alternative � and less expensive � course of action. This involves finding a private company that is prepared to take legal action against its government for restricting overseas investments, thereby contravening EU laws on free trade. If a company took such action and won, all member states would have to comply with the Commission's objective of liberalising pension fund assets within the EU.

Employers who pay contributions to group (life insurance, medical etc) and pension arrangements do not incur social security charges if the contributions are lower than 85% of the social security ceiling (with a sub-limit of 19% of the ceiling for group contributions only). This is known as the 85% rule. Traditionally, supplementary (ie above the mandatory ARRCO/AGIRC plans) defined benefit plan contributions were not included in the 85% rule because: employees were regarded as not acquiring any pension rights until they reached retirement age contributions could not be apportioned between plan participants. Over the last few years, court rulings have been inconsistent as to whether such employer contributions should be included in the 85% rule, but recent cases have all required employers to include defined benefit plan contributions in the 85% rule. It appears that this will be the final ruling on the subject. When the 85% rule limit is reached (which happens for higher paid employees), the excess is subject to social security charges from both the employer and the employee. An immediate review of defined benefit plans will help to minimise the impact of the court rulings.

Employers should consider whether or not this change � which mainly affects eligibility conditions � should be compensated for by additional benefits from the employers' pension plans. The benefit for a survivor with a dependent child under the age of 18 will equal 90% of the net statutory minimum wage level or 70% for a survivor without a child. Under the new regime, only widows and widowers who bring up children under the age of 18 or are born before 1945 will be entitled to a general survivor's benefit. Previously, every survivor who was older than 40 years or brought up children under 18 received the benefit. Eligibility will be further restricted by the introduction of a means test.

The survey contains much information of interest to employers. The highlights are listed below: Despite the raising of the eligibility age for state-provided benefit to 65, most schemes continue to have a normal retirement age of 60. 37% of schemes have 100% vesting of the employer's contribution within ten years of membership. There is no minimum legal vesting requirement. 32% of schemes have an employer contribution of 10% of pay or above. Only 6% of schemes offer members a choice of where to invest their contributions. Complete survey results are available from Mark Weaver on the number below.

Although it is still possible for expatriates to participate on a voluntary basis, their contributions will be subject to normal taxation. The only exception is when the employer and employee agree in their contract of employment to contribute to CPF. In this case, the employee's contribution remains tax deductible but the employer's contribution is taxable to the employee. Given the low CPF interest rate (2% - 3% per annum) and the restricted access to funds, this is not an attractive option. The CPF is a defined contribution retirement programme with employee and employer contribution rates of 20% each, which is fully tax deductible. There is a cap on eligible earnings of S$6,000 per month for base salary, and bonuses are covered up to 40% of salary. Furthermore, when expatriates leave Singapore, the full account balance can be withdrawn without tax or other penalty. In the past, participation in the CPF was mandatory for all expatriates. Exemption was only granted to those who were covered under another (home country or offshore) pension plan. Because of the significant tax advantages of the CPF, some expatriates chose to participate even though they were covered by another plan. Expatriates currently working in Singapore and those who applied for passes before 1 August 1995, will continue to have tax-exempt CPF contributions until 31 December 1998. They and their companies must apply before the end of 1995 to continue their tax-exempt CPF contribution status. Employees who change employers lose their tax-exempt CPF status. Access to funds will continue to be limited to when a member permanently leaves Singapore. Thus, expatriates will need to leave their funds in the CPF (at 2% - 3% return) as long as they remain in Singapore.

Historically, many South African funds have had Namibian members because the former South West Africa was a protectorate of South Africa, and many organisations considered employees based there as part of the broader South African operation. The Namibian members will now be required to transfer to local funds. Transfer in respect of future service only appears to be the most effective course of action (see below). The opinion of the South African tax authorities is that: if a transfer value is made in respect of past service, it will be subject to deduction of South African tax, as the Namibian fund is not approved in terms of the South African Income Tax Act, but tax exemption may be available in South Africa for pensions and lump sum benefits paid from a South African fund, where all or part of the benefit is in respect of service abroad, if less than two years' service out of ten years immediately prior to receipt of the benefit were in South Africa. If the benefit is not exempt on this basis, then the taxable portion is the ratio of South African service to total service. The Namibian authorities do not require that transfers be made to a newly established Namibian fund; in some instances, it may be preferable to retain paid-up benefits in the South African fund with future service only to accrue in the Namibian fund.

Employers should urgently review any policies of excluding groups of employees from benefit plans or of offering entry on different terms. In particular, if part-time employees have not had the same rights as full-timers, employers should ensure that this difference results from objectively justified factors which can be demonstrated and are unrelated to sex the exclusion does not apply to prevent a significantly greater number or proportion of one sex from joining the benefit plan. If there is any possible discrimination that cannot be justified, employers must decide how to: remove the discrimination determine what past service benefits are to be awarded to those employees who have suffered discrimination provide for the cost of these benefits.

Both bills consolidate existing law and are likely to take effect in January 1996. The Employment Rights Bill covers redundancy, maternity rights, unfair dismissal, suspension on health and safety grounds, deductions from pay, notice periods, Sunday working, written particulars of employment, rights to time off work, lay-offs and itemised pay statements. The Industrial Tribunals Bill deals with matters such as tribunal jurisdiction, membership and procedure, recouping social security benefits, conciliation and provisions concerning the Employment Appeal Tribunal.

The Court's decision in the case (Travelers) may have a broad impact on employer health care costs, although it remains to be seen whether other states will now move to impose similar surcharges to help pay the cost of hospital care for uninsured and indigent patients. The New York law imposes a 13% surcharge on hospital bills paid by commercially insured plans and a 9% surcharge on HMOs that fail to enrol certain levels of Medicare patients. Insurers and HMOs had challenged the law, claiming it was barred by ERISA's provision pre-empting state laws that 'relate to' employer plans governed by ERISA. Hospital surcharges imposed by Connecticut and New Jersey were also challenged under ERISA in separate cases. In rejecting such challenges, the Supreme Court found unanimously that the state hospital surcharges have only an indirect economic effect on ERISA plans 'that can affect a plan's shopping decisions, but...does not affect the fact that any plan will shop for the best deal it can get...' The High Court sent the case back to the lower court to clarify the decision's specific impact on self-insured health plans. Whether other states will now rush to impose similar surcharges and how far states can go in imposing such taxes are both open questions under the ruling. The Travelers decision makes it clear, however, that the scope of ERISA pre-emption is not as broad as many employers had hoped.

Under US law, companies must register their shares with the SEC in order to sell stock in the United States. As a condition of registration, foreign companies must either prepare their financial statements in accordance with US accounting standards or provide a reconciliation conforming their financial statements to US standards � including FAS 87, the accrual accounting rule for pension expense. Some foreign registrants, especially first-time offerors in the US, have found it difficult to adopt FAS 87 as of the standard's 1989 effective date for non-US companies. Recently, however, the SEC staff indicated that they would not bar registration by foreign companies that can't adopt FAS 87 as of 1989 because actuarial data for past years is unavailable. Such companies will be allowed to adopt FAS 87 as of a later date, subject to certain conditions specified by the SEC staff. The SEC's new approach appears to offer foreign companies a reasonable, practical and cost-effective alternative for reconciling pension cost under their local law with US accounting rules.

The new study has been expanded to include 22 countries. It is clear that increasingly firms are adopting an integrated, total remuneration approach to compensation and benefit management. But why? Managing total remuneration on a global scale 'Total remuneration' encompasses base and variable pay, long-term incentives, benefits, compulsory contributions to government-run benefit programmes and perquisites. Increasingly, firms are taking this broad view when they develop compensation and benefit management policies. Driving this change are today's more demanding business realities: sharper competition, rising costs and the need to achieve improved performance with fewer resources to please ever more demanding customers and shareholders. As a result, more and more companies are working to ensure that their investment in human resources directly supports their business objectives, and that their remuneration strategies are closely aligned with their business strategies. The total remuneration approach is a powerful human resource management tool. It can have a direct, positive im-pact on business performance, profits and returns to shareholders by helping companies exert more control over labour costs and spend more wisely when they look for staff with the particular skills required to execute business plans. Companies can also use this approach to determine how total remuneration expenditures should be allocated among direct cash payments, benefits and other components to deliver better value to employees and the company alike. Developing a total remuner-ation strategy is a complex matter. It often requires additional data and new methodologies for measuring the value to em-ployees of specific programmes. The challenge takes on an added dimension for companies operating internationally. In addition, they need to understand the way pay practices, legal requirements and cultural factors differ from country to country. Nevertheless, multinational companies increasingly recognise the importance of total remuneration as a framework that can accommodate local differences whilst also providing a consistent approach across countries. Key steps in the total remuneration development process include: objective setting: defining the business and cost objectives that the programme must support, and also determining the organisation capabilities and employee competencies that are needed to carry out the business strategy peer group identification: selecting those organisations with which the company competes for talent, and then determining how to compete for labour more effectively data gathering and valuation: collecting the necessary information on remuneration in comparable organisations and quantifying the value of benefit programmes, long-term incentives and other noncash compensation to enable useful comparisons to be made analysis and strategy development: evaluating how the company measures up to comparable firms and deciding on a total remuneration strategy for reducing any competitive disadvantages. The strategy should also consider problems such as the financing of benefit programmes (eg tax efficiency, vendor strategy). Once the total remuneration framework and database have been developed, the organisation is in a much better position to make strategic decisions on matters such as: the selection of performance measures necessary to drive the business how best to explain the total remuneration programme to employees so they understand the full value of their compensation and benefits what benefit choices and levels of coverage make sense in terms of the needs of employees and the resources of the company how to measure the cost-to-value ratio of compensation and benefit programmes to find more efficient ways of delivering the programme to employees. Ultimately, companies trying to compete effectively need both human resource strategies that match their business vision, and an approach to managing compensation and benefit programmes that provides the maximum value to employees at the lowest possible cost. For a growing number of organisations, the total remuneration framework provides just that.

Additional pay increases may be agreed at company level. The agreement must now be accepted or rejected by branch industry employer organisations before 28 September 1995. If accepted, the minimum increases will be: 1 November 1995: 1.8% 1 October 1996: 1.3%.

Having received parliamentary approval on 4 August 1995, the long-awaited pensions reform legislation is now law. These changes will affect all employees, except industrial sector managers ('dirgenti'). Further, because of the recent privatisation of their own pension system (INPDAI), industrial sector dirigenti are also potentially affected as they have the right to opt for INPS benefits by 31 December 1995. The reform is far reaching and the implications significant. Although in the recent past employers have postponed addressing pension issues for their employees in Italy, the future framework is now clear and employers should act now. The reform: increases employer INPS contributions from 18.83% to 23.66% of covered earnings introduces a new 'contributory method' benefit accrual system significantly reduces expected benefits for individuals at higher earnings levels by introducing a cap (ItL 132 million or approximately US$80,000) on earnings that are considered for pensions attempts to shift pension responsibilities to the private sector by introducing significant incentives for private plans removes the unique seniority pension system ('pensioni di anzianit�') whereby un-reduced state retirement pensions were provided after 35 years of contributions, irrespective of age introduces incentives to postpone drawing retirement benefits until age 65 removes sex discrimination - immediately for new entrants to the workforce and gradually for existing workers. At the earliest opportunity employers should: Review the new retirement benefits, taking into account the changes in social security benefit provision. If a pension plan already exists, it should be reviewed in the light of the new law and in terms of the benefits it provides, its legal structure and its financing, including tax, costs and funding implications. Of special concern are those plans in which the benefit formulae deduct state benefits because of the significant increase in company costs that could result. If no retirement plan exists, review the need for one, either for senior employees or at all levels. Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (1727) 846161 Benchmarking for top executive reward and management development A recent benchmarking exercise for top executive reward and management development policies has revealed a very unstructured approach among Italian companies. The exercise - sponsored by Benetton, ENI, Fiat, IBM, IRI, Montedison, Olivetti, Omnitel, Pirelli and Schneider - collected data from 35 Italian and multina-tional companies covering approximately 400 senior managers. The most important trends revealed were: The recruitment and development of top executives is often the result of friendship or links with present management. There are seldom formal, objective policies and practices in place for re-cruitment and assessment of senior managers. Career paths tend to follow one functional route. Inter-functional careers are rare. Approaches to perfor-mance appraisal tend to be unstructured. Little importance is attached to training of top managers. MBO practices do exist in theory, but in practice they are seldom adhered to. Variable compensation packages are increasing in popularity - typically with 80% of remuneration still fixed - but in reality bonuses aren't always linked to actual performance. Frequently, even managers who do not achieve their performance targets still receive their bonuses, and thus the concept of 'pay-at-risk' is not well established. The survey has raised some very important motivational issues for senior management in Italy, and the main trends and best practices will be presented and discussed during a forthcoming Towers Perrin event in Milan on 30 November 1995, entitled 'Top Manager Management and Development Policies in Companies in Italy'.

The phasing out of the old zloty will take place over two years, dur-ing which time both new and old notes will be legal tender. The new zloty will be worth 10,000 of the old, equivalent to US$42.5. The average monthly wage is approximately US$300. Despite a lengthy phase-out period, the changes have already prompted many employers to issue addenda to contracts of employment to avoid confusion at a later stage. They have also amended pay rates in existing collective agreements.

The 1995 changes are: a more complex, three-step procedure to justify employment of a foreigner for a given post: application to the employment office (as before) request for a residence permit 'named' work permit for an individual employee required employer must pay a fee equal to one month's minimum wage penalties for breaches of the regulations can be as high as US$2,000. Further information: Sylvie Riot, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 Group life assurance boost A small change in corporate tax treatment may be the first step towards increased use by employers of group life assurance contracts. Prior to early 1995, an em-ployer had to deduct employer-paid premia from post-tax profits. Now the premia can be treated as a business cost and paid out of pre-tax profits. The tax regime for employees has not changed; premia are still regarded as employee income and are taxable. Further information: Sylvie Riot, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 Use of short-term contracts restricted Social security regulations have been changed to tackle the excessive use of short-term contracts on which no social security contributions are required. Previously, employers could issue temporary contracts of employment of up to 30 days without being liable for social contributions at the normal rate of just under 49% of gross earnings. A single day between consecutive contracts was sufficient to retain exemption. The change in regulations has shortened social security-exempt short-term contracts to 15 days or less, and if the same employer signs a second short-term contract within 60 days of the first, the two will be combined and the full period assessed for social security contributions.

The income bands on which per- sonal income taxes are calculated have been broadened and backdated to 1 January 1995.

Almost three years ago, important draft insurance legislation failed to become law ecause an early election prevented the Senate from ratifying it. Now the draft legislation, albeit in revised form, finds itself once more approved by Congress and waiting to be debated and ratified by the Senate. But history looks set to re-peat itself as the withdrawal of Catalan Party support for the government threatens to bring next year's spring election forward to this year's autumn. The draft legislation's fate is being anticipated with great interest. Once law, it would bring the Spanish insurance market into line with European Union directives and also have a profound affect on pensions. The main features are: the banning of book reserves as a financing vehicle for company pension plans, leaving only two acceptable alternatives: qualified pension plans or group insurance tax treatment that clearly favours qualified pension plans, reflecting government desires to foment this form of provision a transition period of three years to give companies time to adjust. The key differences between the new draft and the one that fell three years ago are: For new plans created during the transition period, contributions made to fund past benefits will qualify for tax relief under identical conditions as for existing pension plans. This is a great advantage as current pensions legislation is not so favourable to the creation of new plans. 'Re-equilibrium' plans, to amortise existing deficits, must be filed with the office of Director General of Insurance, but they will not need its approval. This will make implementation of newly qualified plans much quicker. Existing plans that are funded through deposit administration contracts (or similar vehicles) and that transfer their fund to a qualified fund will not pay capital gains tax on the accumulated gains at the time of transfer. The deficit amortisation period is extended from 10 years to 15. Every year a minimum of 5% of the overall deficit must be amortised so that at least 50% has been amortised by the 10th year. Companies in the same group can meet their obligations through a single plan and fund, as long as all companies with obligations in the group participate. A clause in an earlier draft, which would have permitted the calculation of vested rights without salary projection, has been removed. This will cause the cost of defined benefit pension plans to increase, especially for companies with high turnovers.

The survey findings emphasise employers' preoccupation with cost control and the continuing shift from merit pay to performance-based incentives and lump sum payments that do not become part of fixed salary costs. The survey sample included more than 1,350 companies in 52 industry groups with annual sales ranging from US$100 million to more than US$10 billion. Their responses show that actual 1995 merit costs for the survey's three employee categories were almost half a percentage point below what was planned for 1995 and several tenths of a percent below 1994's actual merit costs. On average, the companies surveyed will give 1995 merit increases of 3.6% to top management and exempt employees (ie middle man-agement, professional and technical staff) and 3.5% to non-exempt (ie hourly paid) employees. These levels are still above projected 1995 inflation, and employees will not experience erosion of purchasing power. The survey shows that the proportion of companies offering some form of variable pay to employees below the executive ranks continues to increase steadily: 41% of respondents, up from 35% in 1994. Group/ team incentives and spot, or discretionary, bonuses are the most common variable pay vehicles, followed by gain sharing plans and nonqualified profit sharing. Rewards under these programmes are generally in addition to merit increases. The survey results also show that most companies have now introduced some type of flexible work arrangement to help reduce 'work and personal life' conflicts as part of the total reward mix. Flextime is by far the most common alternative work arrangement, reported by almost half (49%) of the companies surveyed. Further information: Susan Rowland, Valhalla, (1) (914) 745 4496 New SEC view of SERPs sparks concern Companies that offer supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) or other non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements may need to register those plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under a new SEC staff interpretation of US securities law. Plans that involve employee 'contributions' may need to be registered - regardless of whether those contributions are merely bookkeeping entries or whether the plan offers investment in actual or phantom employer stock. Under the new interpretation, SEC registration would generally be required for many defined contribution SERPs and other nonqualified arrangements that let executives defer receipt of current compensation until some later date (eg retirement). Some plans that limit registration to a handful of top executives could escape registration. Registering SERPs and other nonqualified deferred compen-sation plans would add only a slight administrative burden (ie the need to file Form S-8) for publicly traded companies in the US. Foreign-owned companies that use Form 20-F to register with the SEC are eligible to use Form S-8 to register their non-qualified plans. However, the new SEC staff position has significant implications for companies that do not already register. In some cases, a plan registration requirement could effectively preclude such companies from offering nonqualified plans. Thus, private companies - in particular many foreign-owned ones - are understandably concerned by the SEC's apparent policy change, especially as the agency has not formally announced its new position but is nonetheless enforcing it in individual cases. Towers Perrin is participating in efforts to encourage the SEC staff to rethink this matter or, at the very least, to openly acknowledge the change and provide formal guidance for employers.

Unless it is defused, the levels of benefits promised under current pay-as-you-go state pension systems will impose unacceptable burdens on future taxpayers. Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK have now all taken steps to reduce this future burden. Other countries such as France and Portugal are formulating their proposals. This change in state benefit philosophy comes at a time when many European employers are recognising that their current supplementary pension provision may neither support their business strategy nor meet the needs of many of their employees. Could the pensions time bomb be just the stimulus employers need to better align their existing arrangements to support the needs of the business and its employees? We believe it is. Employers should start by clarifying benefit objectives and, in particular, how benefits provision should contribute to the creation, attraction and retention of an appropriate workforce. There are several issues that need examining. Whose responsibility? Employers need to reinforce the message that the combination of state and employer provision is unlikely to provide acceptable living standards in retirement and that employees need to make provision through their own savings. At the same time, some employees are demanding greater freedom to manage their own future. Employer cost control Increasing competition and declining margins, combined with the effects of greater disclosure through accounting standards, mean employers are beginning to measure their worldwide benefit obligations on a consistent and high quality basis. Companies are improving their methods of identifying and allocating costs, and this is leading them to understand better the need for cost control in their benefits provision. Core-plus provision To address both the sharing of responsibility between employer and employee and cost control issues, some companies are moving towards a core-plus approach. A basic core level of benefits is provided by the company, with additional benefits provided only where employees are prepared to share costs. Governance Who has the real power to effect change and make key management decisions about benefits provision? Bringing clarity to the decision-making process can raise efficiency because it clearly identifies responsibilities and speeds up change where needed. Managing diversity The workforce is becoming increasingly diverse in terms of its skills, career patterns and needs. To what extent should a company recognise this diversity in its benefits provision? Role of benefits in total pay Benefits are just one (albeit significant) element of an employees total financial remuneration. To what extent should benefits provision be considered in the context of total remuneration, and how? Next steps. An audit of existing provision will identify where current plans are misaligned with benefit objectives and enable companies to set priorities for change. Organisations that have already gone through such a process have ended up with better cost control and a more enlightened workforce that better appreciates its benefits provision.

The new law gives companies an excellent opportunity to reduce labour costs because it: eliminates the possibility of civil lawsuits against employers restricts the occupational diseases that are covered defines a set of standard criteria for permanent disability which will be used by all medical commissions. The first decision companies must make is whether to insure or self-insure against workers compensation risks. They will also need to evaluate a wide variety of factors, including economic conditions and the effect on their financial, taxation and accounting position. The main changes are: New insurance companies (ARTs) are to be set up for the sole purpose of providing coverage of workers compensation risks. Affiliation to an ART will free employers from any responsibility for claims. Employers will have to affiliate themselves to an ART, unless they fulfil the statutory requirements relating to self-insurance (mainly concerning solvency). Employers will have a free choice of ARTs, and insurance companies cannot refuse to insure employers. The ARTs will be able to set their own rate structure (expressed as a percentage of salaries subject to social security charges) for each type of employer. The structures can subsequently be adjusted according to actual claims experience. Employees will no longer be able to bring civil lawsuits relating to workers compensation claims against employers, except in certain circumstances (eg when employers have failed to meet health and safety requirements, and as a result an employee has had an accident). Claimants will receive benefits in kind and in cash: Benefits in cash are defined essentially as annuities designed to replace salary payments, rather than the lump sums traditionally provided by previous schemes. Benefits in kind cover not only medical treatment and supplies but also rehabilitation programmes, vocational re-training schemes and burial services.

Initial contributions will be 1% of salary, rising to 3% in the year 2000. Government contributions will also be made to match employee contributions dollar for dollar, up to a limit based on average weekly earnings. Currently, the superannuation system in Australia consists of: compulsory employer-financed superannuation support for all employees (currently 6% of salary for large employers, rising to 9% for all employers by the year 2002) additional voluntary superannuation support primarily financed by employers with minimal employee financing. With an election to be held prior to the implementation of this new measure, its fate is less than certain. However, the opposition has recently announced support for the continued increase of the current compulsory employer-financed superannuation support. Further information: Warren Burford or Kirk Sutton, Sydney, (61) (2) 229 5111 BELGIUM New royal decree creates uncertainties for new pension law The pension law passed on 6 April 1995 (see Headlines of June 1995) takes effect on 1 January 1996. Employers should adapt their pension plans to comply with the new legislation before that date, if they want to be free to do so without having to: consult the works council or, in its absence, the health and safety committee, or inform the employees themselves before making the changes, if neither of these bodies exists. One requirement of the new law is elimination of sex discrimination for post-17 May 1990 service, which reaffirms the Barber judgment of that date. Those employers who, despite that judgment, continue to treat men and women differently will find the 1 January 1996 target date hard to meet. Meanwhile, a royal decree on transfer values, transitional rules, and past service, is being drafted. In its current form, the decree is not overly onerous concerning transfer values for new plan participants; their transfer values will be lower than they would be in the Netherlands or the UK, for example. It is even less onerous for pre-1 January 1996 participants because transitional rules, taking into account the level of funding, will be available to the plan sponsor. The draft decree also proposes a transitional period ending on 31 December 1996 for the formal adaptation of the plan rules and other documents to the new law and royal decree. :On the other hand, its recommendation concerning past service in case of plan changes is extremely severe. It proposes that the reserve attributable to service prior to any plan modification may not be lower than one based on: the old benefit formula, and the salary at retirement or earlier termination. If this requirement is not eased before the publication of the decree, it will create two problems for plan sponsors: If benefit levels need to be reduced, it will be very costly. Given the atypical nature of many Belgian pension plans, complex administrative difficulties will arise.

Mr Wielockx is a Belgian national who works as a self-employed physiotherapist in the Netherlands but lives in Belgium. He was denied a tax deduction in the Netherlands for contributions he made to a pension plan in the Netherlands on the grounds that he is a non-resident. Mr Wielockx claimed that discrimination of this type is contrary to EU law. The Netherlands cited the Bachmann decision that such discrimination is allowable because of the lack of fiscal cohesion in different EU member states. In its judgment on 11 August 1995, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled against the Netherlands. This strengthens the view that Bachmann is a special case and that contributions made to EU pension plans and life insurance policies should be tax-deductible under EU law. However, a final resolution remains elusive. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 ITALY Best practice in action In this issue, we begin a series which looks at best HR practice in some of Italys leading companies, starting with the state-owned energy group, ENI. During 1995, 15% of ENI has been privatised; it has already undergone a major restructuring, having sold all its non-core businesses (comprising 50,000 employees). This has changed the management structure and responsibilities of the 90,000 remaining staff and has been a major factor in the introduction of a management development system based on competencies (the underlying characteristics of people which result in effective and/or superior performance in a job). The aim of the programme is to improve significantly each managers individual and collective performance to ensure that ENI maintains an internationally competitive position. Since competencies can be developed, the programme plays an important role in management development and career and succession planning. In this context, ENI has also recently introduced an expert system to improve its management selection and succession planning. The expert system is much more sophisticated than a standard personnel database; it is a truly intelligent system, capable of identifying the essential characteristics of 200 key management positions and, when a vacancy occurs, selecting suitable candidates from anywhere within the group. This is how the expert system works in practice: It contains all the basic information about managerial jobs, roles and incumbents. It updates this information continuously with, for example, the results of performance appraisals and management by objectives (MBO) exercises, details of promotions and transfers, and any changes to particular management positions. It defines the essential characteristics of the 200 key management jobs within ENI and then matches them with the competencies of the individuals whose details are held on the system. The result of this analysis is a list of suitable internal candidates for each of the positions. The lists change to reflect changes in the organisation and in the incumbents, but they always remain confidential. When a vacancy occurs, a list of the most suitable people which is much more comprehensive than the two or three obvious candidates already exists. Although the expert system does all the groundwork, however, the final choice of successor is made by a selection board. It tracks recent graduate recruits whom ENI has continued to hire, even during the restructuring, ensuring that they receive the necessary development and experience to enable them to fulfil their potential and follow fast-track careers. The expert system is already benefiting ENI; it ensures that management selection and succession planning are carried out consistently and effectively. It also enables the organisation to identify any gaps in its managerial skills which may need to be remedied by training. These are all important considerations for an organisation which is committed to internal promotion and investment in training. Further information: Giorgio Aiuto, Milan, (39) (2) 863921 Salary survey highlights latest trends The results of Towers Perrins 1995 VALREM survey show that increases in annual base salary are running approximately in line with inflation for professionals and managers. Increases for blue- and white-collar workers, however, are not keeping pace with inflation. Sales staff received one of the highest increases (8.2%), reflecting the importance of sales in generating income in Italys current economic environment. More than 100 companies with a combined workforce of nearly 360,000 employees participated in the survey; information relating to almost 5,000 incumbents was analysed. The most important trends highlighted by the survey are: Remuneration policy in Italy continues to be based mainly on the formula of fixed pay plus variable pay plus benefits. More companies are introducing incentive systems, particularly in functions such as sales, manufacturing and support services (quality, maintenance, purchasing etc). For example, incentives now account on average for 4% of total remuneration for impiegati (white-collar workers) and 12% for dirigenti (senior managers and executives). A number of other companies are planning to introduce incentive programmes when the countrys economic situation improves. Estimated salary increases (a combination of merit increases and an increase in the national agreements) for 1996, based on data collated from participating companies in September 1995, are: dirigenti (senior managers and executives) 6.1% quadri (middle managers and senior professionals) 5.5% impiegati (white-collar workers) 4.9% These increases compare with a forecast inflation rate of 5.8% for 1995 and 5.2% for 1996. The official rates given by the government are 5.6% for 1995 and 4.5% for 1996. More detailed information for 1996 will be collated in the next VALREM survey from January 1996 onwards.

Employer contributions will remain at 12%. Further information: Julia Smith, Singapore, (65) 221 3588 NETHERLANDS Flexible pension plans make progress The Dutch government has agreed to amend tax legislation to facilitate more flexible pension arrangements. This follows the report of a committee set up by the Secretary of Finance last year. Companies can implement the changes now, but will have a transitional period of five years before they are required to introduce them. Companies should review their schemes and identify where and when changes should be made. The most important recommendations are: In final pay schemes, the maximum amount of pension is 2% (of pensionable salary) per year of service. Other types of schemes should provide benefits of the same target level. It should be possible to retire before normal retirement age (between 60 and 65) - but not before age 55 - but any pension must be actuarially reduced. Employees should be able, with their employers consent, to retire at age 55 on a part-time basis. If they move to less senior positions within ten years before normal retirement age, they may continue to build up pension rights based on their former, higher salary. If employees continue to work after their normal retirement date, their pension can continue to accrue up to a maximum of 100% of pensionable salary, including the state pension. The definition of pensionable salary should be extended to include variable forms of remuneration, such as bonuses and payments in kind. Employees without sufficient pension rights should be allowed to make a supplementary payment at a later stage, provided they either worked in the Netherlands or remained covered by the Dutch social security system while on a short-term secondment outside the country. Company savings plan accounts should be able to be released for use as contributions to existing pension schemes. Currently, such savings are blocked for a period of four years and may only be used to purchase annuities from insurers. If a non-Dutch pension scheme has obtained corresponding approval in the Netherlands, it should be reviewed again within the next five years. Further information: Johan Swarts, Rotterdam, (31) (10) 207 1777 SINGAPORE Employment Act amended With effect from 1 November 1995, the following key changes were made to the Employment Act: It now regulates the transfer of workers when employers restructure and move their business to a new corporate entity in Singapore. Workers must be notified of the transfer in advance and must be informed of the reasons, implications and measures being taken as a result of the change. Employment is treated as continuous, and existing terms and conditions remain unchanged. The Commissioner of Labour, the Labour Ministry and the Industrial Arbitration Court all have the power to stop, delay or impose certain terms for the transfer to protect workers interests. The Labour Minister now has the power to regulate part-time employment. The definition of pay used to calculate statutory payments (such as overtime, pay in lieu of notice) has been revised. Shift allowances are now excluded for benefit determination purposes when workers are on outpatient sick leave. Employees working on rest days are now entitled to: one days salary if they work up to half their normal hours, and two days salary if they work more than half their normal hours. The Labour Minister has the power to exempt certain employees from the maximum 12-hour work restriction. Workers with three months service are now eligible for pro-rated sick leave and can receive their full entitlement after six months. The employment of children under age 14 in industrial jobs is prohibited. Further information: Julia Smith, Singapore, (65) (221) 3588 SOUTH AFRICA Legislative developments Recent months have seen several legislation-driven developments in employee benefits, and more particularly in retirement funds. The most important of these have been the Pension Funds Amendment Bill 1995, the Registrar of Pension Funds Circular PF No 86, and the draft Labour Relations Bill. These are summarised below. Pension Funds Amendment Bill 1995. The Bill introduces changes which will have far-reaching effects on retirement funds from 1996 onwards: Almost all new funds from 1996 will be required to have a board of management consisting of at least three members. Members of the fund will be entitled to appoint or elect one of the three. Existing funds will have until 15 December 1998 to comply with the new requirement. The member representation requirements contained in the Bill should be viewed as a minimum requirement. Several parties, including the Commissioner for Inland Revenue, are on record as preferring to see equal member and employer representation. The draft Labour Relations Bill (see below) may also influence developments in this area. The fiduciary duties of board members will, for the first time, also be set out in the Act. The office of a Retirement Funds Adjudicator will be established. All funds will be required to comply with a prescribed dispute resolution procedure which will override any contrary provisions in the rules of the fund. Any member not satisfied with the response to a dispute may be referred to the Adjudicator. The ability to deduct outstanding contributions from a members benefits will be restricted to contributions owed by the member only. Draft Labour Relations Bill. This Bill is already being considered by Parliament. It states that: Unless the matters for joint decision-making are regulated by a collective agreement with the representative trade union, an employer must consult and reach consensus with a workplace forum before implementing any proposal concerning...changes made by the employer or by employer-appointed representatives on trusts or boards of employer-controlled schemes, to rules regulating social benefit schemes. Many of the implications of the Bill are still unclear. For instance, the exact interpretation of what constitutes an employer-controlled scheme is uncertain. However, it is probably safe to say that anything less than equal representation for members on the board of management of a scheme will constitute a case of employer control. An employer-appointed chairperson with a casting vote (on a board with equal representation) will probably also constitute employer control. In the context of the Bill, social benefit schemes will include most (if not all) employee benefit schemes, retirement funds, medical benefit schemes and others. The exact implications of the Bill should become clearer as it completes its passage through Parliament. Registrar of Pension Funds, Circular PF No 86. This deals with the minimum disclosure requirements to be applied to all retirement funds with effect from 1 July 1996. Funds will have to provide: an explanatory pamphlet to new members within three months of joining a fund an annual benefit statement for each member (excluding pensioners and deferred pensioners) to be distributed not later than six months after the financial year end of the fund. The circular defines the minimum information to be included in the pamphlet and benefit statement. Notification to members will also be required in certain specific circumstances, eg fund restructuring. Further information: Ian Patrick, Johannesburg, (27) (11) 322 8078 SPAIN Insurance law finally comes into force After an extremely long, drawn-out and complex process, lasting nearly four years (see Headlines of October 1995), the new insurance law (Ley de Supervisie. The law affects both individual and occupational pension plans. Below is a commentary on those aspects of the new law which employers will need to consider since they affect their current and future pension liabilities: The banning of book reserves as a financing vehicle for company pension plans leaves only two acceptable alternatives: qualified pension plans or group insurance. Companies have a transition period of three years in which to make their choice. Although this measure gives employees more secure pension rights, it has severe financial implications for those companies with heavy pension obligations. Many companies may try to renegotiate their current obligations. The law introduces tax treatment that clearly favours qualified pension plans, reflecting the governments intention of encouraging this form of provision. The rules for qualified plans are: Plans must be open to all employees and be governed by a commission of control with majority employee representation. Qualified majorities may be used for major decisions, thus giving effective veto powers to employers. For new plans created during the transition period, contributions made to fund past service benefits will qualify for tax relief under identical conditions as for existing pension plans. This is a significant advantage as current pensions legislation is not so favourable to the creation of new plans. A waiting period of six months applies before this transition rule comes into effect. Re-equilibrium plans, to amortise existing deficits, must be filed with the office of Director General of Insurance, but they will not need its approval. This will make implementation of newly qualified plans much quicker. Existing plans that are funded through deposit administration contracts (or similar vehicles) and that transfer their fund to a qualified fund will not pay capital gains tax on the accumulated gains at the time of transfer as long as they were created to fulfil obligations existing prior to 3 March 1995. The deficit amortisation period is extended from ten years to 15. Every year a minimum of 5% of the overall deficit must be amortised so that at least 50% has been amortised by the tenth year. Companies in the same group can meet their obligations through a single plan and fund, as long as all companies with obligations in the group participate. Although the annual contribution limit per participant has been raised to Pts 1,000,000 per year, the tax deductible limit remains at Pts 750,000. The rule for group insurance is: If a company wishes to take a tax deduction for the premiums it makes for past or future service benefits of active employees, it will have to impute these to them as taxable income. Many companies using this alternative will forego the tax deductions to avoid this imputation. Some companies who dont wish to open their plans to all employees, and who view group insurance as an unfavourable alternative, may simply liquidate existing promises by converting them to cash compensation subject to requiring that these cash amounts be channelled to some form of individual retirement vehicle. The new legislation is extremely complex and will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming Towers Perrin Update.

It applies to all companies - whether publicly or privately owned - that follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the US, including non-US multinationals and US subsidiaries of such multinationals that prepare US GAAP financial statements either to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements or as required by certain lending institutions. FAS 123 applies to all of a company's stock-based compensation plans for executives, employees and outside directors, except for employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), which are subject to a separate standard. Covered plans include stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock grants and stock purchase plans.

An increasing number are recognising that relatively small reductions in benefit costs - achieved without necessarily reducing benefit levels - can have dramatic effects on the financial results of their business. Broadly, these companies are ensuring that: their international bulk purchasing power and volume of aggregate benefit assets are used effectively their spending is tightly targeted to achieve good 'value for money' their resources are centralised, rationalised and achieving synergy. Examples of measures that these companies are taking are discussed below. Alignment of benefit programmes with business and HR objectives. Remuneration and benefit programmes need to support business and HR objectives. This alignment can be achieved by conducting an audit of existing programmes against business objectives and employee needs. This then identifies priorities for change, where necessary. Benefit programmes that send conflicting messages to employees are being realigned to support other initiatives such as performance management, flexible working practices and competency-based pay. Global benefits management. A number of companies are examining ways to manage benefits more effectively on a worldwide basis. Trends include: centralising those responsibilities and key high-level functions that have traditionally been delegated to local operations outsourcing functions, such as benefits administration, that can be undertaken more cost-effectively by an external provider. Use of a global actuarial adviser. Increasingly, multinational companies are appointing a single global actuarial firm to advise both headquarters and local management because doing so: ensures consistent, cost-effective and high-quality advice to both sets of management enables the adviser to tailor its advice to the worldwide needs of the company and to detect potential conflict early on. Global pension asset management. As a rule of thumb, an increase in investment return on pension assets of 1% pa implies a 15% reduction in ongoing costs. Opportunities for more effective asset management can be achieved by headquarters management: issuing investment guidelines with which local managers must comply, and/or appointing one or two preferred investment managers to manage the retirement assets of the organisation's international subsidiaries. Multinational pooling of insured benefits. A number of multinational organisations still do not take advantage of their bulk buying power when they buy benefits insurance. Multi-national pooling can achieve cost-savings of up to 25% each year on worldwide employee benefit insurance premiums. Organisations that have implemented the above measures have realised significant savings and/or identified opportunities to offer better value in their benefits provision for the money they are currently spending. Further information: Marc Hommel, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 BELGIUM Pension law demands action The Royal Decree relating to the pension law of 6 April 1995 (see Headlines of June and December 1995) was finally signed on 10 January 1996. It confirms that the transitional period for the formal adaptation of the plan rules and other documents to the new law will end on 31 December 1998. However, a more stringent provision has been added at the last minute: employers must, during the first half of 1996, inform plan members in writing of the effect that the new law has on their rights. The contents of this document may be general in nature and do not have to be personalised. Employers will also have to: incorporate the Barber judgment into their plans as soon as possible, if they have not already done so (because of the levelling-up associated with Barber, each day of postponement costs money) apply all other provisions of the new law and its Royal Decree with retroactive effect from 1 January 1996 (the key provisions concern plan entry and termination of employment) consult the works council or, in its absence, the health and safety committee on plan changes (if neither of these bodies exists, the employees themselves need to be informed before changes are made). Provisions concerning transfer values remain as set out in the draft Decree: with few exceptions, they may not be any lower than the legally required minimum reserves. In contrast, the provision relat ing to past service in the case of plan modification has been significantly diluted. The Royal Decree now states that the reserve attributable to service prior to any such modification may not be lower than one based on: the old benefit formula the salary at the time the plan is modified (the draft Royal Decree proposed the use of salary at retirement or earlier termination). This is the good news. The bad news is that the Royal Decree confirms that the actuarial basis to calculate reserves and, by analogy, transfer values and lump sum payments in lieu of pensions must be specified in the plan rules. The implication is that each change of the actuarial assumptions, including the adoption of a new commutation discount rate, is in fact a plan modification subject to the same minimum past service provision as all other plan modifications (see above). Further information: Ludwig Scheiff, Brussels, (32) (2) 775 8411 ITALY INPDAI will not be privatised Employers need to monitor developments concerning INPDAI (the pension scheme for industrial sector managers) now that the decision to privatise it has been reversed. In particular, INPDAI may now be affected by the far-reaching changes to the social security system (INPS) implemented in August last year (see Headlines of October 1995). The following questions arise: Will INPDAI, in the same way as INPS, now need to be converted to a 'contributory method' benefit accrual system? Will the cap on earnings (of ItL132,000,000, or approximately US$80,000) for pension purposes be imposed? If so, the cap will apply to most future INPDAI members who, by definition, are managers and are likely to earn in excess of ItL132,000,000. Will the maximum benefit from INPDAI continue to accrue over 30 years, when the accrual period for INPS is 40 years? In particular, employers should consider how their managers' expected benefit levels will be affected. Further information: Marco Boschetti, St Albans, (44) (1727) 846161 JAPAN Problems continue for pension funds Although deregulation is under way, companies continue to face challenges in relation to pension funds - qualified pension plans (QPPs) and employee pension funds (EPFs): Unrealised capital losses on funds invested with trust banks are 13.5% on average. The guaranteed interest rate on funds invested in life insurance company general accounts - which was reduced in April 1994 to 4.5% from 5.5% - is likely to be further reduced to about 2.5% in April 1996. Allowing for tax of 1.173% and administration charges, the outlook for QPP general account returns under current investment approaches is only 1% or 2% per year. Japanese pension funds are under-weight in equities (25%) and over-weight in bonds (70%), even though bond yields are at historical lows. Fund managers still tend to focus on limiting the downside - investing heavily in domestic fixed interest instruments yielding only 1% or 2% - notwithstanding final pay-related liabilities growing at 4% or 5% per year. Recent investment returns on EPFs were as follows: On the brighter side, plan sponsors are taking much more interest in how their pension funds are invested, and some fund managers are eager to implement asset allocation guidelines that are structured to achieve the sponsors' investment objectives and risk return preferences. A key part of the solution is to shift into higher yielding equities. Over the past 25 to 30 years, Japanese equities have out-performed bonds by more than 3.0% per year. In addition, market value accounting will be introduced for EPFs from 1997, and they will be required to have formal investment policy statements from April 1996. The application of international accounting standards that measure assets at market value and liabilities on more realistic assumptions than under the current statutory method is also anticipated in Japan in the near future. However, the Government intends to reduce the tax-deductibility of book reserved retirement liabilities - internal financing - putting more pressure to improve re-turns on externally funded plans.

The Act introduces far-reaching changes to State-provided benefits for widows and widowers and will take effect from 1 July 1996. Employers should consider whether or not these changes - which mainly affect eligibility conditions - should be compensated for by additional benefits from the employers' pension plans. The main provisions of the Act are as follows: Three categories are eligible for benefit: survivors with children under the age of 18 - survivors who are disabled - survivors born before 1950. The maximum amount of benefit payable will be 70% of the net statutory minimum wage; it will also be means-tested. Survivors with children under the age of 18 will receive an extra benefit of 20% of the net statutory minimum wage, irrespective of their income. Orphans in full-time education will receive benefit until they reach the age of 21, instead of 27 as previously. Registered cohabiting partners will be entitled to benefit under the same rules as widows and widowers. The estimated drop in the number of eligible survivors will be from the current 200,000 to 15,000.

If adopted, the expected implementation date will be 1 January 1997. The proposals are contained in a Government working paper which recommends that all savings and investment providers should give full details of their products to the public. The paper suggests that an investor or saver should receive comparable information whether they wish to invest in a unit trust, life policy or corporate superannuation scheme. The information should include answers to questions such as: What sort of investment is this? What returns will I get? What are my risks? A more detailed document - a prospectus - should be available on request. Under the proposed new regime, trustees of corporate superannuation schemes would have to provide new members with an investment statement with a standardised content. Small schemes would be exempt from the prospectus requirements. Further information: Mark Weaver, Wellington, (64) (04) 499 0277 Human rights guidelines published The commission that administers the Human Rights Act 1993 has finally published guidelines about how the Act applies to superannuation schemes. The guidelines are less stringent than had been feared by many commentators; for example, a scheme's disability income benefit can offset any benefits received from the State. The Act prohibits discrimination on a variety of grounds ranging from gender, age and disability to sexual orientation and marital status. The deadline of 31 December 1995 for amendment to existing schemes has been extended by two months. Trustees need to advise the Government Actuary that they have received independent legal advice that their scheme complies with the legislation. Although there are no specific penalties for non-compliance, the commission will probably directly approach any scheme that fails to comply. Copies of the guidelines are available from Mark Weaver on the number below. Further information: Mark Weaver, Wellington, (64) (04) 499 0277 SOUTH AFRICA Retirement benefit provision policy in the spotlight Employers will need to consider their future retirement benefit strategy to take account of the reports of two Government-appointed commissions of inquiry released in December 1995. These hold significant implications for the future development of retirement benefit provision philosophy and policy in South Africa. The more important issues are summarised below. Katz Commission report. The third interim report of the Katz Commission, which is considering the taxation system in South Africa, was released on 5 December 1995. Previous recommendations of the commission concerning the taxation of retirement funds had met with some criticism (see Headlines of December 1994 and February 1995), and the commission was asked by the Standing Committee on Finance to consider these further. The principal recommendations of the current report are: Defined benefit schemes were singled out for special consideration in terms of the deductibility provisions, but no specific details were provided. Separate deductibility limits should be set for benefit funds and medical schemes. These deductions would be allowed over and above retirement fund deductions. All benefits arising on the death, retirement or other termination of service of a member, whether in lump sum or annuity form, should be treated as a single lump sum for taxation purposes. This means that the lump sum equivalent (or capital value) of a pension benefit should be added to the amount of any lump sum, and the total taxed at the point of exit from membership in accordance with the following provisions: The minimum tax-exempt amount on death or retirement would be SAR50,000. To encourage people to take pensions instead of a lump sum, a greater amount would be tax-exempt if an annuity were to be selected, with a maximum tax-exempt amount of SAR380,000. The tax-exempt amount on resignation would be SAR2,000. The taxable amount of the total capital value should be taxed on a sliding scale, depending on the amount of the net capital value. The sliding scale would be more penal for resignation benefits than for death and retirement benefits. Tax exemptions on lump sum benefits payable from public sector retirement funds should be withdrawn, and compliance with deductibility provisions should also be enforced. Accrued rights should, however, be recognised. The proposals will undoubtedly generate much reaction and debate, but appear to offer a better framework than the original ill-defined proposals a year ago. Some of the proposals could potentially be incorporated into the budget in March 1996, but given their far-reaching implications, and the recommendation of the Smith Committee (see below), it may still be some time before major changes are made. Smith Committee report. The Smith Committee, instructed to 'inquire into the efficacy and efficiency of the present retirement arrangements and to make recommendations for improvement', reported on 15 December 1995. The committee adopted a more cautious approach than the Katz Commission. Its primary recommendation is for the formation of a National Retirement Provision Forum which will establish retirement provision policy by considering an initial draft policy framework based on the recommendations of the committee itself. Such a process is likely to be lengthy. Other major recommendations of the committee are: Personal provision should form the greatest part of retirement provision, and the Government should embark on a marketing campaign to emphasise the success of the retirement fund movement in South Africa and to make voluntary personal provision the cornerstone of retirement funding. Retirement benefits that yield income are preferable to lump sum benefits. Preservation and portability of benefits should be facilitated and encouraged. The administration and management of the current Old Age Assistance System should be enhanced. Public sector retirement provision should be carefully assessed, particularly issues such as the funding of benefits, equality of treatment between the public and private sectors, and the extent and nature of benefits provided.

This now makes the tax-deductible limit the same as the maximum contribution limit, which was increased from Pts750,000 to Pts1,000,000 under the new Insurance Law which was passed on 9 November 1995 (see Headlines of December 1995). If the tax-deductibility had been maintained at its previous level of Pts750,000, it would have been unlikely that anyone would contribute the additional Pts250,000 allowable, since it would be paid for out of net income, but taxed as gross income when it was received as a benefit payment. Raising the tax-deductible limit further reinforces the position of qualified pension plans as the principal vehicle for private pension provision.

The largest banking and insurance employers are also likely to follow suit. In theory, the UK's opt-out of the Social Chapter means that UK companies do not have to comply with the Works Council Directive. In practice, however, many UK companies are deciding to give their UK employees the same consultation rights as their continental European counterparts. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has calculated that over 100 UK-based international companies fall within the terms of the Directive, and it expects all of them to establish works councils for their UK staff. Under the Directive, companies with at least 1,000 staff within member states (excluding the UK) and with at least 150 staff in each or two (or more) member states (excluding the UK) must create consultation and information committees for employees. Companies in other member states have until 22 September 1996, when the Directive comes into effect (except in the UK), to negotiate works councils in the way that best suits their needs. Further information: Grace Borrelli, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 New 'company share option plans' introduced in budget In the wake of the publication of the Greenbury Report on Directors' Remuneration (see Headlines of August 1995) in July, the British Government removed income tax relief on share options granted after 17 July 1995. At the time, there was some criticism of this move, on the grounds that it penalised middle managers and other staff, but did not in practice affect higher-earning executive directors, who were the subject of the Greenbury Report. In response, the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed in the budget at the end of November 1995 new, income tax exempt 'company share option plans' or 'CSOPs'. These plans will enable companies to grant options over shares with a value of up to �20,000 to employees. If the plan is approved by the Inland Revenue, there will be no income tax to pay either when the options are granted or when they are exercised. The �20,000 ceiling applies to all the unexercised options held, and their value is based on the price of the shares at the time they are granted. There are separate transitional arrangements for companies that wish to convert their pre-July 1995 approved plans into the new CSOPs. The budget also introduced measures which make tax-relieved all-employee share schemes more flexible. The two types of approved plans are save-as-you-earn (SAYE) option plans and profit-sharing plans. In addition to the existing five- and seven-year savings contracts available in SAYE schemes, a new three-year contract will be introduced. The minimum savings amount has been halved to �5 a month, and it will also be possible to operate SAYE schemes in conjunction with an employee share ownership trust. For profit-sharing schemes, the period that shares must be held in trust to gain tax relief has been reduced from five to three years. Shares must be held in trust for two years, and if the shares are sold after two years but before the end of year three, there will be an income tax charge on 100% of the value of the shares.

The Directive must be implemented into the national laws of member states by 22 September this year. The Directive is designed to give European employees of multinational organisations a greater voice in their companies' business decisions. Here are the answers to some common questions our multinational clients are asking. Which companies are affected? The Directive applies to all multinational organisations with a combined total of at least 1,000 employees in the following EU countries and at least 150 employees in each of two of these countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. The UK is not currently among this group, having exercised its long-standing right to opt out of EU employment policies. This does not mean that British companies are exempt from the Directive. It simply means that UK employees aren't counted in determining whether an organisation is subject to the Directive and need not be included in any works council arrangements. Thus, for now, a multinational company with, say, 5,000 employees in the UK and 2,000 in Germany would not be subject to the new consultation requirement, while a company with 850 employees in Germany and 150 in France would be covered. What does the Directive require? Multinational organisations subject to the Directive will be required to establish appropriate arrangements for formal consultations with employee representatives (if employees exercise their right to request such arrangements). This has been a priority for the European trade unions for many years. They view the Directive as a way to recruit new members, increase their influence and play a role in determining how multinational organisations manage their resources in Europe. Employers can, however, shape the way the works councils are formed and operate. The Directive gives companies three broad alternatives: They can develop a voluntary agreement with employee representatives before September 1996. This offers companies maximum flexibility, giving management and employee representatives wide latitude to develop a framework that meets their mutual objectives. They can negotiate voluntary agreements within the terms of the Directive after September 1996. This preserves some management flexibility but requires compliance with formal standards spelled out in the Directive. Finally, they can wait until September 1999 and create a model works council according to highly detailed standards, outlined in the annexe to the Directive, which afford little management flexibility. Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages, and no one approach will be right for every company. However, all companies need to decide on their approach as soon as possible. Further information: Grace Borrelli, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 EUROPEAN UNION Compulsory membership of pension funds survives challenge The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that compulsory membership of supplementary benefit plans for particular professions does not contravene EU law. The case involved a Dutch physiotherapist who did not want to become a member of the supplementary pension plan that compulsorily covered employees in his profession. He claimed that compulsory membership contravened the EU principle of free competition. Although this decision clarifies the issue of compulsory membership of a professional fund, the question of compulsory participation in an industry-wide fund still remains open. Such funds are prevalent in countries such as Finland, France, Germany and the Netherlands. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 Pensions portability suffers setback The European Commission has postponed a decision on draft legislation covering cross-border transfers of supplementary pensions. The matter has now been referred to a working party that is examining barriers to workers moving freely within the EU. The group has six months in which to decide whether EU legislation is appropriate. Although state pension schemes are already co-ordinated within the Union, approximately half of the EU's workers also have private or company pensions to supplement their state provision. If these workers move from one EU state to another, they significantly reduce their supplementary entitlement. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 FINLAND Mandatory earnings-related pension plan changed The mandatory employers' earnings-related pension plan (the TEL plan) was changed with effect from 1 January 1996. The changes are intended to encourage employees not to retire before the age of 65. Previously, employees receiving a disability pension, an early retirement pension or an unemployment pension accrued a retirement pension at the rate of 1.5% per year (at the same rate as those in employment), payable at age 65. Under the new rules, the rate of accrual for a retirement pension for these categories is: 1.5% per year to age 50 1.2% per year between ages 50 and 60 0.8% per year between ages 60 and 65. The basis for calculating pensionable salary under TEL has also been changed, but this will be phased in gradually between 1996 and 2005. Before 1 January 1996, it was based on average earnings during the last four years. In future, it will be based on the average salary over the last ten years of service. Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 654 1700 FRANCE Additional costs imposed on private group insurance plans With effect from 1 February 1996, employers and works councils have to pay a new 6% tax on any part of the premiums they pay for private group insurance plans. For their part, employees have to pay the new 'social debt reimbursement contribution' of 0.5% on that part of the premium paid by the employer. Employers should therefore review the impact of these additional costs and decide, if necessary, on a plan of action. In January 1996, the daily fee that has to be paid by anyone being hospitalised was increased from FF55 a day to FF70 a day. Private medical plans either reimburse, fully or partially, such fees or do not reimburse them at all. Employers that provide full reimbursement need to decide if the private plan should take the full increase, and if so, how the extra cost should be apportioned. In the light of these new costs, employers should identify the true costs of operating private plans and may wish to consider cost controls by: gradually modifying benefits that are 'inflationary' and cause plan deficits discussing the issues with their employees and reaching consensus about a plan of action. Further information: Elise Nault, Paris, (33) (1) 41 02 02 HONG KONG Compulsory retirement benefit system to be introduced Employers should evaluate the potential impact of the proposed Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) system that is expected to be fully operational by 1998. The Government is currently finalising the rules and regulations that will govern MPF plans. This process is expected to be complete by early to mid 1997. The MPF system represents a major change to retirement provision that currently consists only of voluntary employer-sponsored plans. The MPF will have far-reaching benefit design and cost implications for employers. Its key features are: Contributions will be made by both employers (5%) and employees (5%), based on total earnings (limited to HK$20,000 per month). Employees earning less than HK$4,000 per month will have the option of not contributing. Each employer may choose to either set up its own MPF scheme or contribute to a master trust. The MPF schemes must be defined contribution. Benefits must be fully vested ie employees are immediately entitled to all the contributions made by their employer. In addition, they must be fully preserved ie held within an MPF scheme until the employee: reaches age 65 reaches age 60 and retires dies becomes permanently disabled permanently leaves Hong Kong Expatriates will be excluded from the MPF.

INDICOD, the research sponsor, is an association of 18,000 Italian companies that together represent all sectors of the consumer goods market. The study was based on data gathered from a significant sample of INDICOD's members. The study highlighted the following features of human resource management systems: External recruitment is as frequent as internal promotion. Formal performance appraisal is not particularly important to an individual's career progression. Training courses - both internal and external - are a significant element in salesforce development. There is an increasing emphasis on incentive systems. The most interesting findings regarding competencies are: Competencies are differentiated by roles and not by strategies or businesses. Respondents identified common competencies for sales in general and managerial roles in sales; these are, respectively: a knowledge of the business, its products and its distribution system communication skills, motivational skills and leadership. Competencies that need to be developed in the future are: customer service orientation teamwork and co-ordination planning and analytical skills open-mindedness knowledge of the competitive marketplace merchandising knowledge of how distribution companies are organised. Further information: Stefano Antonelli, Milan, (39) (2) 863921 JAPAN Flex plans given a boost Flex plans are expected to take root and grow rapidly now that a major tax obstacle has been removed. The obstacle was potential 'constructive receipt' tax treatment of all employee benefits if an employee could choose from a flex menu of benefits, some of which would normally be non-taxable by concession. An official newsletter recently issued by the National Tax Bureau states that, even if such flex benefit options are available, the selection opportunity should not, of itself, trigger constructive receipt. This official tax opinion removes a major tax uncertainty and is a big step forward in favour of flex. The tax bureau has already applied this new tax treatment to the first two flex plans in Japan, one of which was established in 1995, and the other one earlier this year. More companies will follow suit. Although employee benefit plans in Japan are relatively comprehensive, traditional plans have major weaknesses, including: incompatibility with the changing workforce structure and employee needs lack of employee understanding and appreciation poor cost-effectiveness and increasing cost burden plan designs often mismatched with corporate objectives. A flex plan can resolve these problems and be much more attractive to existing and new employees. Further information: Tetsuo Tohno, Tokyo, (81) (3) 3581 5731 MEXICO Social security system overhauled Companies with operations in Mexico will need to review their employee benefit strategy in the light of social security reforms that will come into force in 1997. The reforms will affect retirement benefits, health and welfare benefits and workers' compensation. They are designed to strengthen the financing of the social security system, improve the minimum level of benefits and enhance benefit equity, and also encourage Mexican working people to save more of their income. Key features of the reforms are: Retirement benefits Benefits formerly provided from a defined benefit pension programme, a defined contribution programme (SAR) and a special housing programme (INFONAVIT) will be consolidated into a single employee retirement account These new accounts will be financed by a combination of voluntary employee contributions and mandatory con-tributions from employees, employers and the government. Contributions must be invested with special retirement fund administration companies (AFORES). At retirement, employees must use their account balances to purchase life annuities from an insurance company or the AFORES. Social security disability pensions will be set at 35% of the average covered salary during the last 500 weeks of covered employment, indexed according to inflation. Health and maternity benefits The funding of health and maternity benefits will be separated and their financing methods changed, through the creation of a new family insurance (voluntary affiliation). Workers' compensation Companies' individual claims experience and level of risk, rather than industry claims experience as previously, will be taken into account in the assessment of company contributions. Further information: Sylvia Alvari�o, Mexico City, (525) 596 9553 NETHERLANDS Sickness Benefits Act abolished From 1 March 1996, most of the statutory sickness benefits under the Sickness Benefits Act (ZW) will no longer be payable. Instead, employers will be required to pay employees on sick leave 70% of their salary, up to a ceiling set for 1996 at Dfls 75,583 for a maximum of one year. Employers will be able to fully or partially insure themselves against that risk. Currently, employers are only responsible for paying sick employees 70% of their salaries for a period of two weeks (small companies) or six weeks (large companies). The current ZW contribution rate will be abolished. To finance the remaining ZW benefits, contributions to the Unemployment Benefits Act (WW) will be increased. Further information: Barbara Admiraal, Rotterdam, (31) (10) 207 17 77 SOUTH AFRICA Tax changes affect employee benefit plans Employers may wish to review the design and asset strategy of their employee benefit plans, following the tax changes announced in the budget on 13 March 1996. The budget broadly endorsed the proposals of the Katz Commission (see Headlines of February 1996) concerning: consistent tax treatment of private and public sector funds tax neutrality between forms of retirement provision (pension, provident and retirement annuity funds) an incentive in favour of a lifetime annuity (pension) as opposed to lump sums taxation of income as it arises rather than when it is paid out. Implementation of the budget proposals will, for the most part, be delayed for at least a year. However, immediate tax changes are being imposed on the assets of retirement plans that will no longer be totally tax-exempt. A tax of 17% will be charged on gross interest and net rental income. This tax will affect all pension, provident and retirement annuity funds (including state and semi-state funds). Special provisions will apply in respect of the portion of rental and interest income attributable to assets funding the liabilities of existing pensioners, and in respect of retirement plans where rental and interest income-bearing assets comprise more than 50% of the total market value of the assets of the plan. The taxation of benefits in terms of the Katz Commission proposals will not be implemented until 1 March 1997 at the earliest. The vested rights of public sector employees will be entrenched, and the new provisions will be phased in over a period of five years for private sector employees.

The party did not gain an absolute majority in the lower house, as had been forecast by most polls. It is 19 seats short and will therefore have to depend on support from the nationalist and regional parties who have 25 seats between them. It remains to be seen how much of the Popular Party's economic programme, summarised below, will be implemented. It is, in any case, unlikely that the new Government will, in the short-term, make any meaningful changes to the Insurance Law passed in November 1995 (see Headlines of December 1995). Companies should therefore evaluate the effect of that legislation on their pension arrangements, rather than wait and see how the economic programme fares. The following is a summary of the economic programme. Pensions The Toledo Pact (agreed to by the major political parties in 1994 to ensure the long-term viability of the social security system) is to be implemented. However, experts believe that the Pact will prove insufficient. Its key measures are: separate financing of contributory and non-contributory pensions unification of all social security categories under a single contributory earnings ceiling integration of the special social security regimes (mining, agriculture etc) into the general system continuation of the pay-as-you-go basis of funding maintenance of the maximum pension continuation of indexation of pensions in line with consumer price increasing the averaging period for pensionable earnings encouragement of flexible approaches to retirement encouragement of private supplementary retirement provision, probably by tax incentives ensuring a proportionate relationship between contributions paid and benefits received by employees improvement in the management and control of the social security system, particularly as regards fraud. Employment establishment of a social pact between the government, unions and employers introduction of more incentives for the self-employed and those working in small- and medium-sized companies. Personal income tax simplification of tax scale and reduction in top marginal rate from 56% to 40%, as finances permit (the Catalan Party is only committed to a reduction to 48%, so the Government will need to negotiate) reduction in capital gains tax and wealth tax introduction of more favourable tax treatment of housing. Corporate income tax depreciation schedules to be improved double taxation of dividends to be eliminated. Further information: Cristina Satr�stegui, Madrid, (34) (1) 564 2052 SWEDEN Social security cash benefits reduced Some social security cash benefits - including sick pay and parental pay - were reduced by approximately 10% with effect from 1 January 1996. Sick pay. The revised levels of sick pay are as follows: Day 1 0% Days 2-14 75% (paid by the employer) Day 14 onwards 75% (paid by social security) Most employers top-up sick pay to a maximum of 85% (the legal maximum additional contribution) until day 90. They do so either because of a relevant collective agreement or because they wish to offer competitive benefits. Similarly, employers usually also provide sick pay for earnings that exceed the social benefit ceiling of SEK271,500. Parental pay. Social security provides parental pay during leave to look after a child for a maximum of 450 days after the birth of that child. The leave may be taken at any time during the first eight years after the birth, but before the end of the first school year. With effect from 1 January 1996, the rates are as follows: First 300 days 75% of ordinary pay (previously 80%) paid to either parent 30 days 85% (previously 90%) paid to the mother only 30 days 85% (previously 90%) paid to the father only 90 days SEK60 per day (unchanged) paid to either parent Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 654 1700 UNITED KINGDOM Court ruling confirms exclusion of pension rights from Acquired Rights Directive The High Court has confirmed that employers do not need to provide pension arrangements for staff who are acquired as a result of a business transfer. The case (Adams v Lancashire County Council and BET Catering Services Ltd) was brought by three trade unions on behalf of 11 part-time female council employees who lost their pension rights when their jobs were transferred to the private sector. The Court ruled that the council had not contravened EU law by not ensuring that the women's pension rights were transferred to their new employment and that the UK's Transfer of Undertakings Regulations correctly implement the EU's Acquired Rights Directive. The ruling makes clear that pensions are excluded from the Acquired Rights Directive and that EU member states are only required to protect pension contributions accrued up to the date of the transfer of a business. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 Pension splitting on divorce moves forward The House of Lords has amended the Family Law Bill to allow the value of occupational pension benefits to be split at the time of divorce in a similar manner to other matrimonial assets. This could involve payment of a transfer value to an individual arrangement. The Government has stated that it will attempt to reverse this amendment. The Pensions Act 1995 already contains provision for 'deferred maintenance' where a portion of a member's benefit is earmarked for the ex-spouse on divorce. When divorced members draw their pension, the earmarked portion is paid to their ex-spouse. The provisions in the Family Law Bill are in addition to those in the Pensions Act; whatever happens, it is likely that schemes will have to comply with the earmarking provisions of the Pensions Act for some time before any new proposals can become effective. Further information: Philip Christison, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 Challenge to Working Time Directive defeated The UK Government has failed in its attempt to have the Working Time Directive declared unlawful on the grounds that an inappropriate legal basis (health and safety) was used for its adoption. The November 1993 Directive regulates the maximum working week (48 hours), shift patterns and annual holidays throughout the EU. The UK had argued that such matters were a question of social policy. On 12 March 1996, Advocate-General Philippe Leger issued an Opinion that the Directive had been adopted on the correct legal basis. If the European Court of Justice (ECJ) endorses this Opinion in a full ruling expected in the summer, the Directive will be confirmed. The UK Government has already stated that it will apply none of the Directive's provisions until the ECJ has ruled. Other member states have either already implemented the Directive or are in the process of doing so before this autumn's deadline. Further information: Grace Borrelli, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 UNITED STATES Health care costs remain in check in 1996 Despite a slight increase in the average rate of employer health care cost growth, employers generally are seeing another year of moderate increases in the cost of employee and retiree health benefits in 1996, according to Towers Perrin's seventh annual health care cost survey. The survey confirms the important role that managed health care delivery systems, such as health maintenance organisations (HMOs), are playing in US companies' ongoing efforts to control the growth of health care costs - especially with regard to coverage for Medicare-eligible (ie age 65 and older) retirees. Towers Perrin's recently completed 1996 Health Care Cost Survey of more than 150 large employers found the per capita cost of employee coverage under non-HMO plans increasing at a rate of about 4% on average this year, up from about 2% in 1995. For HMOs, the average employer's cost continues to decline - by about 1% for active employees this year (2% in 1995). On a composite basis, taking into account both employee and retiree coverage, HMO and non-HMO plans and all levels of coverage (eg employee-only, family), the average employer will pay about 3% more per capita for health care this year than last.

At the same time, however, many employers have been hesitant to provide extensive information about investing those savings out of fear that they could be considered 'investment advisers' under US law - with fiduciary liability for any losses participants might suffer from relying on such information. Recently, the US Department of Labor (DOL) issued long-awaited guidance that goes far toward easing employers' fears by clarifying the line between investment 'education' and the more closely regulated realm of investment 'advice'. The new guidance specifies four types of investment-related information that employers can provide without worrying that they might be exposing themselves to fiduciary liability in the DOL's view. The DOL guidance offers added comfort to employers who want to take a more proactive approach to educating employees about their retirement savings programmes, plan investment options and the basics of saving and investing for the long term. It also may require minor adjustments in some employers' current plan communication materials.

It seems that scrutiny has now given way to action. Among the 44 large companies participating in a new Towers Perrin CompScan survey, for example, fully half have already terminated their pension plans for outside directors or are planning to in the very near future (in many cases, before they issue their 1996 proxy statements). In eliminating defined benefit pensions for their directors, most of these companies are moving to unfunded deferred compensation accounts denominated in company stock to make up the lost benefits.

In spite of its strategic advantages, such activity can sometimes produce unpleasant surprises and disappointing results. HR issues provide a good example of what can go wrong. Here are some approaches that companies can take to maximise the potential opportunities and minimise the potential pitfalls. Any acquisition has two phases: before the transaction and after. This article concentrates on the first phase; the second will be the subject of the leader in the next issue of Headlines in August. Before the transaction is completed, a typical flow of events in a non-hostile takeover could be: pre-bid activity due diligence review of target company negotiation of price and approach contract wording. HR professionals have a role to play during each of these stages. Pre-bid activity. The HR department should be consulted to help assess the impact of HR issues as part of deciding whether to pursue the target. It should, for example, consider the likely costs of any redundancy programmes, and build appropriate employment costs into any financial modelling of the target business. Due diligence review. Some of the key items for review are: employee benefit plans: The buyer should ensure that sufficient funds or reserves exist to discharge any likely liability. promises and acquired rights: The buyer should bear in mind that not all long-term commitments are in the form of written plans. level and structure of compensation: The buyer must analyse how the target company�s compensation levels compare with those of its competitors and how well the structure will integrate with the buyer�s system. staff skills, and development and training: The buyer will need to determine whether the appropriate skills and competencies exist to carry out the post-acquisition business plan. employment terms for key executives: The buyer should establish whether key executives have employment contracts and whether they will require guaranteed severance arrangements or supplementary retention devices (such as restricted stock grants) to remain in the new organisation. collective bargaining agreements: The buyer needs to be aware of any agreements that oblige it to agree to employment conditions set on an industry basis. Negotiation of price and approach. If the due diligence review uncovers significant HR issues, the buyer can proceed in one of three ways: quantify the potential financial impact and adjust the bid price accordingly do not adjust the bid price but agree with the seller a framework for quantifying the cost impact and settling the issues financially after the deal closes ignore the information or use some of the details in negotiation. The specific circumstances of the deal will dictate which approach makes most sense. However, the second approach usually provides the best protection. Contract wording. The section of the purchase agreement that deals with HR issues can fulfil at least three purposes: It can provide a sequence of actions to be taken between parties after closure. It can provide protection � in the form of warrants that all relevant facts have been disclosed � from unpleasant surprises. It can specify exactly how the accrued liabilities under benefit plans will be treated and how any monetary adjustment will be calculated and remitted after the closing. The purchase agreement can even specify procedures � including an arbitration procedure � to be followed to resolve issues still outstanding when the agreement is signed.

The survey was conducted among 261 companies operating in all sectors of the economy. Its main objectives were to: identify the most commonly provided benefits collate information about coverage, eligibility and financing. The benefits most commonly provided by Brazilian employers are medical care, meal allowances and group life insurance, with more than 90% of participating companies providing all of these benefits. The full pattern of corporate benefit provision is shown in the chart below. The percentage of companies providing a pension plan has increased to 52% in 1995 from 20% in 1985. More than half (53%) of these plans are either defined contribution or hybrid, reflecting employers� wish to control costs and minimise risk.

It introduces a �whistle blowing� provision, strengthens the powers of the Pensions Board and improves the position of trustees. Whistle blowing. The bill introduces a requirement to blow the whistle on any potential fraud or misappropriation. Failure to do so will be an offence punishable by a maximum fine of IR�1,500 on a summary conviction or one year�s imprisonment or both. Those with a duty to blow the whistle include trustees, anybody to whom the trustees have delegated a duty, actuaries, insurance companies and investment managers, and those who prepare schemes� annual reports. Pensions Board. The board will have greater powers to: investigate and intervene remove and replace trustees give guidance on the operations of the Pensions Act apply for court orders concerning wrongful payments or transfers of assets, unsuitable investments and arrears of contributions. Trustees. The bill significantly improves the position of trustees by: removing the anomaly that a trustee could be found guilty of an offence, even though the problem was caused by the failure of a third party allowing them to charge the costs of �appropriate training� to the scheme giving them direct representation on the Pensions Board by requiring that at least one member of the board be a trustee.

Currently, the lower paid (and those earning the National Average Wage) suffer a small tax penalty by virtue of the tax at 33 cents in the dollar levied on a scheme�s investment income and on the employer�s contribution. From 1 July 1996, the marginal tax rate for members earning between NZ$9,500 and NZ$34,200 will decrease from 28% to 24%, making a difference of 9% in the rate for the scheme and the member. From 1 July 1997, the difference will increase to 12%. If no changes are made to the new tax basis, then companies should start to consider alternative products such as unit trusts, which are taxed more favourably for the average New Zealand worker.

The bill incorporates major changes to the disclosure requirements by corporate superannuation schemes to their members. It is currently not clear when the committee will report back to Parliament and whether or not changes will be made to take account of the legitimate concerns of corporate schemes.

Plans considering asset swaps will need to carefully review the costs associated with the transaction as well as the mechanics of the swap and the management of the offshore assets. The move to allow swaps is part of the process of liberalising South Africa�s foreign exchange that began in March 1995. The Reserve Bank has specified a number of parameters within which each swap has to operate. The critical constraint is that South African foreign exchange reserves must remain unaffected. This is achieved by matching the outflow with an equivalent inflow from a foreign investor. At this stage, only physical asset swaps are permitted (excluding derivatives), although there is some flexibility regarding the nature of assets to be transferred. The limit was initially set at 2.5% of total plan assets; however, on application, permission will be granted for up to 5%. Asset swaps have clear benefits for the South African parties, including diversification, potential for higher returns, exposure to different economies, and protection against the volatile currency. The small percentage of assets remains a significant constraint. The attraction for foreign investors is less clear. They are free to participate directly in the market and would need some enticement in order to engage in the additional complications of an asset swap. Where discounts are available, these are typically less than 1.5% and may be linked to a lock-in period. There may be some liquidity advantage, as well as a marketing advantage, in terms of establishing a name and obtaining South African money to manage offshore.

The options give employees the right to purchase shares in the future, often at a rate determined at the time of grant. The Supreme Administrative Court had previously ruled that taxation is not applicable at the time of grant of stock options. Income tax is currently levied when employees have the right to exercise the grant, regardless of whether they do so or not. However, the National Tax Board has now decided that a tax liability does occur at the time of grant, according to �market conditions�. This liability will be determined by calculating an �expected future value�, using assumptions based on the Black- Scholes method. The tax authority in Stockholm has already indicated that the �expected value� will be subject to tax after 1 January 1996. It is not yet clear how the �expected future value� will be assessed by local tax authorities.

The issue is important because the costs of long-term care can be substantial; as the population ages and life expectancy increases, it is likely that many individuals will need some form of care during their lifetime. The purpose of the paper is to establish a framework for partnership between the state, individuals, their families and financial institutions to reduce the financial impact of long-term care. The main principle behind the proposals is that individuals who take steps to protect themselves against the costs of long-term care by, for example, buying insurance will be able to enjoy additional allowances when applying for state benefits. At present, individuals who have more than �16,000 of assets must fund the entire cost of care from their own assets and only individuals with less than �10,000 in assets have all the cost of their care needs met by the state. Proposals set out in the consultation document would allow an individual who purchased insurance to increase the �16,000 limit. The higher the level of insurance purchased, the more assets that would be protected when applying for state benefits. These proposals are similar to schemes operated in some parts of the United States, such as California, Connecticut, Indiana and New York. Further information: Philip Christison, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 Executive remuneration consultation paper issued A key recommendation of the Greenbury Committee�s report on remuneration for directors of UK listed companies (see Headlines of August 1995) was that the value of a director�s pension entitlements earned during the year should be disclosed. The committee asked for, and the UK actuarial profession prepared, a recommended method of calculation. However, once these proposals had been analysed, several commentators believed that the proposals were difficult to explain, likely to be misinterpreted and unacceptably volatile. This led the Stock Exchange to ask the actuarial profession to broaden the scope of its review and present a consultation paper. The results of this consultation exercise, together with the UK actuarial profession�s recommendations, were published on 30 April 1996 and, although the consultation process produced no clear consensus, the report recommends that companies disclose both: the increase in the amount of accrued pension during the year the capital value of the increase in pension or sufficient information such that an outside party could place a value on the increase in pension. It is recommended that the capital value be calculated using the pension scheme�s normal basis for calculating transfer values or its equivalent. The above applies only to defined benefit arrangements. For defined contribution (money purchase) arrangements, it is the contribution credited to the director that should be disclosed. The next stage of the process will be for the Stock Exchange to prepare an appropriate listing rule that incorporates these recommendations; this will then be the subject of further consultation. Further information: Philip Christison, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 UNITED STATES High Court ruling raises new concerns for employers A recent decision by the US Supreme Court suggests that employers need to be more careful than ever about how they communicate their business plans to employees when those plans could have an impact on employee benefits. The ruling is particularly applicable to situations in which employee benefits stand to be affected by a significant business restructuring, such as a spinoff or divestiture. In the case decided by the Supreme Court, an employer had organised a new subsidiary that consisted of several existing divisions. When the new subsidiary failed and its retiree medical programme was cancelled, the subsidiary�s employees sued the parent company, seeking restoration of their former retiree medical benefits. Among several issues litigated all the way to the Supreme Court was the question of whether the company was acting as plan administrator � rather than as employer � in its pre-spinoff communications with employees and, thus, whether a fiduciary standard should be applied to its conduct. Employers who serve as plan administrators of their ERISA-covered benefit plans � as many do � often find themselves wearing two hats. In deciding whether to sponsor or terminate a benefit plan, employers make business judgments that are generally not subject to ERISA fiduciary standards. Once a plan is adopted, however, the same employer may also serve as plan administrator, a role subject to a fiduciary standard of conduct in which the employer must act solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries. Knowing when an employer is wearing which hat has been a grey area in the law and a continuing challenge for employers. Ultimately, the Supreme Court concluded that the employer spoke as a plan administrator in this case when it conveyed the basic message to employees that transferring to the new subsidiary would not significantly undermine the security of their benefits. Thus, the High Court upheld the trial court�s ruling that the employer should provide �equitable relief� � including in this case restoration of the benefits � to the employees. The ruling (Varity v Howe) not only is likely to fuel more litigation by employees and retirees whose benefits are reduced following a restructuring, it also makes it clear that employer communications will be scrutinised carefully and could be held to a very high standard of care in such cases.

Workers compensation cost growth slows As recently as 1993, the cost of workers compensation programmes � state-mandated medical and income-replacement benefits for workers who suffer work-related injuries and illnesses � was rising rapidly for many, if not most, employers. By last year, however, only half of the 686 employers participating in Tillinghast � Towers Perrin�s third biennial survey of workers compensation costs saw those costs as a threat to their bottom line. Indeed, 41% of the respondents in our 1995 survey reported that their workers compensation costs actually declined over the last two years, while only 30% reported cost increases over the period. However, despite the favourable trends many companies are seeing, the survey shows that direct workers compensation expenses remain a significant cost of doing business in many parts of the country � averaging 2.09% of payroll for the 1995 survey participants (down from 2.16% in 1992). The survey responses confirm that most employers have implemented a broad array of workers compensation cost management initiatives in recent years, such as safety initiatives/injury prevention programmes and case management approaches (both used by 88% of the respondents). The responses also reveal an opportunity for using more focused performance measurement as a tool to better understand which initiatives are most effective and, thus, further improve programme performance and results. For example, most survey respondents now collect a fair amount of data on injuries and illnesses, but relatively few use that data to measure the effectiveness of their programmes and ensure continuous improvement in their internal performance and that of their workers compensation vendors.

Creating a harmonised employee benefit package is a necessary step towards integrating one of the new organisation's most important assets -- its people. Instead of the traditional approach of ignoring employee benefit issues for as long as possible and only considering them in isolation and mainly as a risk management issue, companies should take a pro-active approach. The starting point is to identify what the combined organisation is trying to achieve, what is required of the employees and how compensation and benefit programmes should support this. Once the agenda for benefit issues has been defined, it must be driven by the organisation. Otherwise it will be set by the piecemeal solutions that are adopted as individual issues arise. The agenda will comprise three elements: benefit objectives, benefit principles and gaining acceptance. Benefit objectives. The organisation needs to identify and communicate a clear vision of its benefit objectives. For example: establishing an employee benefit programme for each operation that is fully aligned with the employment deal offered to employees by the combined organisation providing these benefits as efficiently as possible ensuring that employees recognise the value of the benefit programme. Benefit principles. The next step is to develop benefit principles that support these objectives. These can be divided into: design principles (what the company wants to provide and to whom) delivery principles (how it wants to provide them) governance principles (structurally how benefit issues will be managed within the organisation). Design principles might set out the organisation's competitive stance on benefits and their position within the total remuneration package. Delivery principles might set out a common financing policy for benefits, including use of multinational pooling. Governance principles might set out the extent to which corporate or regional headquarters should be involved in decisions on benefit design and delivery issues. The aim of the design principles is to identify the company's overall attitude to providing employee benefits. The delivery principles should identify how the organisation wishes to provide benefits in order to maximise efficiency and limit risk. Gaining acceptance. To work effectively, the benefit objectives and principles need to be accepted at several levels: senior management operations HR as well as benefits finance. Acceptance is needed both locally and at regional/corporate headquarters. Local acceptance is crucial to successful implementation. A key element in achieving success is the role the international benefit manager plays, which has two basic elements: setting and monitoring policy communicating with local operations and senior management. There will undoubtedly be obstacles in the way of achieving the process outlined above. The most common one is a lack of time. However, in most cases, some straightforward steps can be taken: buying sufficient time to set up benefit programmes that are durable identifying those issues that need to be addressed immediately. There is still a need for the acquiring company to carry out the traditional due diligence process before the acquisition. However, the advantage of a clear strategy is that this process becomes much more focused and therefore more efficient. The ultimate success in mergers and acquisitions comes from having clear, widely accepted benefit objectives and principles, and mechanisms to implement them effectively throughout the organisation.

Although change is certain, there will not be any fundamental shifts in the role or operation of corporate superannuation funds. Employers should ensure that their superannuation planning recognises the potential changes that are expected over the next few years. The government is continuing the mandatory Superannuation Guarantee System requiring minimum employer contributions, currently at 6%, but increasing to 9% by 2002. It will also maintain the current tax structure and intends to implement the previous government's proposal for mandatory employee contributions to be matched by the government (although the delivery mechanism is likely to be different). The match is now likely to be provided as a tax rebate, rather than a direct payment to the fund. The key changes planned by the coalition are the introduction of added flexibility and choice to superannuation in a range of areas. The most significant of these are: Individual retirement savings accounts (RSAs) will be introduced by banks and other financial institutions without a trustee structure, but will be subject to the same tax treatment as superannuation funds and will be regulated by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Changes to union-based industrial awards and workplace agreements will provide members with a choice from up to five funds (including employer funds, industry funds, personal funds and RSAs). Introduction by the year 2000 of members' rights in defined contribution funds will allow benefits to be moved between funds nominated in awards and agreements. Funds will be encouraged to provide member choice, both in investment strategy and in benefit design, by the year 2000. People earning less than A$900 per month will be allowed to elect additional wages instead of compulsory superannuation contributions. Individuals will be allowed an 18% tax rebate for contributions of up to A$3,000 per annum for a spouse earning less than A$10,800 per annum. The issue of accessing superannuation moneys by individual members for the purposes of their own housing needs has been discussed for some time and may emerge as a government policy in due course; it is likely to be based on withdrawal of funds, rather than on the member taking a loan from the retirement fund.

He indicated that he would be pursuing two distinct, but mutually reinforcing, policies to: eliminate unjustified investment restrictions widen the debate on pension funds, including cross-border mobility and tax issues. As part of the policy to eliminate investment restrictions, Mr. Monti is writing to several member states to warn them that they are in breach of Treaty provisions against privileged access and discrimination. If their response is unsatisfactory, the matter will be referred to the European Court of Justice. To widen the debate, the Commission is preparing a policy document, to be presented before the end of September this year, which will cover a number of pensions issues, including: regulating pensions funds in the EU whether the same rules should apply to both pension funds and life insurance the need for optimal investment of pension fund assets and the role of EU Treaty rules in removing unjustified investment restrictions the role of efficient capital markets in maximising pension fund investments cross-border mobility of workers (including those seconded to another member state) the impact of tax on pension funds. Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 FRANCE New Agreement On Pensions Will Significantly Affect Future Retirement Income On 26 April 1996, union and employer representatives reached an agreement to stabilise, at least in the short term, the financial situation of the two national mandatory contributory retirement schemes, ARRCO and AGIRC. Employers who offer supplementary benefit arrangements that are integrated with social security and ARRCO/AGIRC benefits should look at the design of these plans and, if necessary, consider changes to protect them against future decreases in the ARRCO/AGIRC schemes. For employers who do not offer supplementary plans, now may be a good time to review their retirement policies. Employers should also consider the responsibility they want to assume in the retirement planning of their employees. ARRCO and AGIRC are pay-as-you-go national retirement funds that cover, through mandatory employee and employer contributions, all salaried employees. Under these arrangements, retirement points are purchased each year with contributions. These points are accumulated during the career of the individual and then converted into pension using a point value at retirement. As for most pay-as-you-go systems, the unfavourable demographic trends in France are exerting pressure on the financing of these arrangements. In France the proportion of retired people to working employees is expected to increase from 33% in 1996 to 63% in 2040. It is hoped that the new agreement will ensure the financial equilibrium of the ARRCO/AGIRC schemes until 2005. Future negotiations are scheduled in 1999 and 2002 to review the new measures and, if necessary, extend them. The key measures are: increase in the minimum ARRCO contribution rate on Tranche B earnings (FF 161,220 - 483,660 in 1996) from 4% in 1996 to 16% in 2005 the increase in the minimum AGIRC contribution rate on Tranche B and C earnings (FF 161,220 - 1,289,760) to 16% moved forward to take place in 1999, rather than 2003 consolidation of the 45 ARRCO funds under a single unified one as of 1 January 1999 a relative annual increase in ARRCO point purchase price a relative annual decrease in ARRCO and AGIRC pension point value. These last two measures will severely impact the future level of retirement income provided by the ARRCO/AGIRC schemes and could reduce the annual pension by up to 20% depending on the employee profile. This could result in significant cost increases for employers who guarantee supplementary benefits integrated with those under the mandatory schemes. The government has promised new legislation in the autumn that would facilitate the accumulation of retirement capital to supplement the mandatory schemes. Whether this will translate into improved savings plans or a new fiscal infrastructure for retirement funds is yet to be seen. One thing is certain, however: given the trend on the evolution of social security and ARRCO/AGIRC benefits, private supplementary pension plans in France will become increasingly important.

The aim of the change is to shift the burden of payment during the first five years from the government to employers by introducing differentiated contributions and by giving employers the opportunity to opt-out. If employers choose opting-out, they will need to take out a contract with a bank or an insurance company covering the risk that payments may have to be made. In addition to the differentiated contributions, employers will also have to pay a national contribution (basispremie) for existing disabled employees. The act will probably come into force on 1 January 1997.

There is now a wide range of products to meet the diverse requirements of employers and employees. However, careful evaluation of employer and employee requirements and the ability of these products to meet them is essential. Health care costs in South Africa have risen rapidly over the last few years, accounting for as much as 10% to 15% of pay. The main reason for these runaway costs is fee-for-service programmes, which tend to give providers incentives to deliver more services. Two new medical benefit products have recently been developed: managed care and savings accounts. Managed care, which is the hallmark of medical benefit programmes in the United States, introduces information systems, quality controls and negotiated prices into the delivery of health care. Managed care benefits use contracted 'networks' of providers that agree to follow medical protocols and accept pre-determined prices for their services. Major insurers and other parties in South Africa have invested hundreds of millions of rand in building managed care systems to lower costs and improve quality. Savings account products, also called 'new generation' schemes, combine insurance for hospital costs with an employee-funded account for 'controllable' day-to-day expenses such as doctor visits and medicines. These products give employees a strong incentive to control costs because any unused savings are refunded or carried over to the next year. At the same time, employees carry the financial risk for the cost of health care, which can exceed their savings if serious illness occurs. Further information: Steve Raetzman, Johannesburg, (27) (11) 269 0394 TAIWAN Mandatory National Health Insurance Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) was established as of March 1995 to address the flaws of the previous health care system: primarily inadequate funding, administrative inefficiency, insufficient controls over cost and utilisation, and an uninsured population of 40%. All citizens are now required to enroll in NHI; foreign employees are eligible to enroll on a voluntary basis. NHI is financed by employers, insured members and the government. The contributions are: 4.25% x contribution rate x member's family size x covered earnings the contribution rate is 60%, 30% and 10% for employers, members and the government, respectively. NHI provides comprehensive health care; coverage includes inpatient and outpatient treatment, dental care, Chinese herbal medicines, prescription drugs, preventive care, prenatal care, etc. Additionally, insured members have free choice of doctor and hospital. The cost and utilisation controls are achieved by requiring the patient to follow a prescribed treatment path. For example, patients are subject to higher co-payments if receiving treatment without proper referral. NHI uses a fee schedule and per capita charges to control cost and utilisation escalation. As in other countries, the new system is in a state of flux as it balances the diverse needs of people. However, the Taiwanese government is committed to achieving its goal of 'health for all in Taiwan' by the year 2000.

They will come into force on 6 April 1997. In addition, an actuarial guidance note (GN27) that details how to perform the MFR calculations has been published. The MFR applies to all UK occupational pension schemes except defined contribution schemes, non-tax approved schemes and certain statutory schemes. Trustees of occupational pension schemes are required to obtain MFR valuations including certification of the funding level (ratio of scheme assets to MFR liabilities) and certification that the contributions payable by the employer are sufficient to maintain, or achieve within a specified period of time, a 100% MFR funding level. The first MFR valuation must have an effective date of not more than three years after the last pre-6 April 1997 formal valuation. It must then be renewed, in the normal course of events, at three-year intervals. In practice, MFR valuations are likely to follow the normal valuation cycle.

In preparing its election manifesto, the Labour Party has issued a paper on its policies for future retirement provision in the United Kingdom. The major issues raised by the paper are: State benefits will remain largely in their current form. Recent reductions to State benefits would not be reversed and no one-off increases to these benefit would be awarded (as per previous Labour Party policy). Occupational pension scheme rules would remain largely unchanged, although the requirements to provide information about benefits may increase. In addition, member involvement in the running of schemes could increase, and the Minimum Funding Requirement may be made more stringent. Low-cost simple multi-employer pension arrangements would be encouraged to cater for individuals who currently have no pension arrangements. A new individual savings account would be introduced allowing individuals to save for the long-term, but with fewer restrictions than current pension arrangements. For example, funds in the account could be used to finance mid-career re-training. In a separate move, Frank Field, a Labour MP with a keen interest in social security issues, introduced a Bill in the House of Commons that would establish a savings vehicle similar to a 401(k) plan in the United States. Although this Bill is unlikely to become law, it is similar to the individual savings accounts proposed by Labour and indicative of the support for this sort of arrangement within the Labour Party.

Indeed, performance-based annual and long-term incentives now account for about two-thirds of the total CEO pay package on average among the 250 large companies included in the study. Another clear indication of chief executives' growing stake in their organisations' performance is the rising level of CEOs' shareholdings in their companies. Among the companies in our analysis, CEOs held company stock worth eight times annual base salary at the median, up significantly from the five-times-pay multiple recorded just two years earlier. Stock options remain the most common long-term incentive in use, granted by 89% of the companies studied. This is up from 75% granting stock options the previous year. The analysis also shows clear differences in incentive payouts to CEOs between the higher- and lower-performing companies (as measured by 1995 total shareholder return). For example, the median annual CEO bonus at the higher-performing companies was about 86% greater than at the lower-performing companies. A similar pattern was evident in the expected value of long-term incentive payouts as well. These findings underscore the pay-for-performance connection inherent in incentives.

The evolution of global compensation strategies Until fairly recently, most multinational organisations compensated their employees around the world on a 'divide and conquer' basis: Local nationals were compensated according to locally competitive practices. Headquarters-country expatriates were typically compensated using the 'balance sheet' approach -- designed to maintain the expat's home-country standard of living. So-called third-country nationals (TCNs) were generally also compensated under a home-country (or headquarters-country) balance sheet approach, depending on their status and the company's commitment to the balance sheet philosophy. As a result, pay for local nationals, expats and TCNs varied widely -- even when these individuals had similar skills and training, filled similar roles at the same location and performed at comparable levels. For many years, such differentials posed no problem. Companies could justify their rich expat packages because of the valuable role expats played in disseminating the headquarters country's superior technological and operational know-how. However, as multinational companies evolve into truly 'global' organisations, they leverage skills from many locations around the world and often have centres of operational and technological excellence outside the headquarters country. In filling key international posts, global companies increasingly look to global talent pools. In many instances, international operations are now managed by highly qualified local nationals who view headquarters transferees as no more valuable -- although more expensive under the balance sheet approach -- than other candidates. What's more, expatriates' expectations differ markedly today from in the past. Where once expats viewed international assignments as short-term career interruptions, many now prize and actively pursue such assignments as critical to career advancement. And many no longer believe they can -- or should -- maintain a home-country lifestyle that's increasingly unaffordable for the company and can hinder integration into the local organisation and culture. The new wave. In view of these realities, many multinational companies are moving away from their traditional emphasis on home-country pay practices and creating programmes that more closely align compensation with today's global business needs and strategies. In these programmes, participation and remuneration levels depend more on the company's global reward strategy and an individual's level and role in the organisation than on local practices. Typically, for example: Base salary for senior executives is set according to a worldwide pay structure designed to provide both flexibility and fairness. Base pay for middle management is keyed to a regional pay structure. Short-term incentives are based on a combination of corporate, line of business, unit and/or individual performance, measured against well-defined objectives. Incentive opportunities are based primarily on role and level in the organisation and, at lower levels, are influenced by regional/local practices. Long-term incentives for upper management increasingly follow worldwide guidelines, with adjustments for tax requirements in the country of residence. Employer-provided benefits and perquisites are pegged to local practices, but guided by an overall executive benefit strategy. Highly mobile employees may participate in an international benefit programme. The one-size-fits-all balance sheet method is giving way to an array of approaches for different categories of expats -- balanced by appropriate local and global reward strategies. Ultimately, the more global the company, the less its executive remuneration programme is influenced by national borders. For senior management especially, global organisations are increasingly managing short- and long-term incentive programmes on an integrated worldwide basis, focusing on what works best to motivate employees to achieve business objectives. And while compensation design and incentive plan participation will always be sensitive to tax and regulatory considerations, taxes (especially headquarters-country tax policies) are no longer the overriding concern. More and more, international pay packages are designed in the context of a broadly defined competitive global market, to emphasise the individual's economic value to the company and his or her performance.

The budget introduces measures that represent additional administrative and cost burdens for employers. However, it also reaffirmed employer-provided retirement income (known as superannuation) as the central pillar in the country's retirement savings system, together with the government's commitment to compulsory superannuation. For the majority of superannuation fund members, the budget announcements will have only minor immediate impact. As expected, though, the government moved to address issues of perceived inequity -- specifically, the criticisms that superannuation has offered relatively greater, and unjustified, tax concessions to those on higher incomes. The key changes are: A contributions tax surcharge on employer contributions to a superannuation fund will apply where an individual's total income, including deductible superannuation contributions, exceeds A$70,000. The surcharge reaches its full 15% when income reaches A$85,000. This is in addition to the existing contributions and benefits taxes. Details on how this will apply to defined benefit funds are to be advised. The proposed collection mechanism for the surcharge is complex and will increase costs for all funds, even those that have no members subject to the surcharge. There will need to be additional tax payable on ex gratia payments and other unfunded benefits received by high income earners to align with the contributions tax surcharge. This will be based on service before and after 20 August 1996. There are changes to standard contribution limits that determine the total maximum deductible superannuation contributions an employer can make. Employers may no longer use the standard contribution limit (of A$27,170 times number of employees) if they have ten or more employees. The more complicated and restrictive age-based calculation must now be used in respect of each employee to determine the maximum deductible contribution. An 18% tax rebate for contributions of up to A$3,000 by an employee for his or her spouse will be available where the spouse's taxable income is below A$10,800. Employees earning between A$450 and A$900 per month will be able to receive cash in lieu of Superannuation Guarantee (compulsory) contributions. The government remains committed to the concept of compulsory employee contributions and matching government contributions, but the delivery mechanism has yet to be decided. The government confirmed its commitment to permit various financial institutions to offer retirement savings accounts that will be capital guaranteed. The age limit for superannuation contributions for employed persons has been raised from 65 to 70. From 1 July 1997, there will be incentives to take out, or maintain, private health insurance. The incentive will take two forms: for low income individuals, couples or families -- a tax rebate or reduction in premiums for private health insurance for single individuals with taxable incomes over A$50,000 and families with combined taxable incomes in excess of A$100,000 -- a Medicare levy surcharge (ie additional income tax) of 1% if they do not have private health cover. The main implications of the above changes are: increased administration for both fund administrators and employers increased cost of providing defined benefits for high income earners decrease in relative attractiveness of superannuation for high income earners; for people on high marginal tax rates, the tax benefit of superannuation compared with taxable salary has been reduced to a differential of approximately 7% reduced scope for large contributions to accumulation funds on behalf of particular individuals a probable move by many employers to salary packaging.

However, the letter also raises a range of new questions. It is confirmed that only objective criteria can be used to determine categories of employees eligible for participation in a company pension plan. The Insurance Control Authorities will judge the acceptability of the adopted criteria. The circular letter indicates that distinctions based on seniority and the nature of the employment contract (permanent versus temporary) are acceptable. Distinctions based on age and, of course, gender will be rejected. Plan participation has to be immediate for employees over age 25 and the probation period cannot be invoked to delay actual enrolment. Although the decision to alter or suspend an existing plan is left to the discretion of the employer, the circular letter advises employers to obtain written consent from each individual participant or to formalise the decision by means of a collective labour agreement, to avoid plan changes being invoked as a cause of breach of the employment contract. Vesting is immediate unless the plan rules include a vesting period of a maximum of one year with respect to employer-financed benefits. At termination, the employee has three options as to the delivery of the vested benefits: maintain deferred rights transfer the accrued reserves to the pension plan of the new employer transfer the accrued reserves to one of the institutions that administer extra-legal pensions in accordance with the provisions of the Royal Decree dated 14 May 1996. The surrender option is no longer available, although this has encountered strong opposition from the pensions profession and therefore needs further clarification. The circular letter raises many issues. The most important issue is that the pensions profession challenges its binding character in the light of the pre-existing legislation. However, while clarification is being sought, it is likely that outstanding controversial issues will find a natural and pragmatic solution as real case questions emerge. Further information: Marcel Rottiers, Brussels, (32) (2) 775 8411 FRANCE Pension funds bill announced Employers should review their current retirement policies and pension plans in the light of the draft pension funds bill announced at the end of August. The bill aims to put in place a framework for supplementary plans on top of social security and mandatory plans. It is currently being discussed in parliament at a time when the government is already under considerable pressure to tackle the issue of pensions. The main proposals for these supplementary plans are: They are to be collective arrangements (as opposed to individual ones) with optional employee participation, put in place either unilaterally by the employer or by negotiation with employees. Employer contributions to the plan, if any, have to be defined in the same way for all employees. They are limited to seven times employees' contribution. Employer contributions will be tax-deductible. Employee contributions will also be tax-deductible, but the limit is not known yet. Funds can only be managed by insurance companies. Employees will participate in investment decisions through a surveillance committee. At retirement, the funds must be converted into a lifetime pension that may be reversionary. The following points are either unclear or contentious: What will be the final tax treatment of contributions and investment income? Will contributions and investment income incur social charges? Will the insurance companies' monopoly on funds management be challenged? Will a lump-sum option at retirement be added? Further information: Simon Desrochers, Paris, (33) (1) 41 02 02 02 NETHERLANDS Tax changes affect expatriates' pension arrangements As a result of an amendment to Dutch tax law, it is now more difficult for foreign pension plans to qualify for tax relief in the Netherlands. Although the amended law still allows pension relief for individuals who transfer to the Netherlands, but remain in their home-country pension plan, it includes extra conditions that must be met if the homecountry pension plan is to be recognised for Dutch tax purposes. Employees working in the Netherlands who belong to a Dutch pension plan are normally subject to Dutch income tax on their employer's contributions, and their own contributions (if any) will not be tax-deductible. However, on certain conditions, Dutch law currently provides exemption from these tax liabilities for expatriates who remain in their home-country plan on transfer to the Netherlands. The existing conditions contained in Dutch law were: The Dutch employer must contractually provide that the expatriate is covered under the home-country pension plan. The tax relief (tax-free entitlements to pension and deductions of the contributions) of the home-country pension plan must not be more favourable than under an ordinary qualifying Dutch pension plan. The tax treatment in the Netherlands must not be more favourable than in the home country. The tax authorities in the home country must declare that: the home-country pension plan can be considered as a typical pension plan in the home country the future pension benefits relating to the pension rights accumulated during temporary employment in the Netherlands will be taxed in the home country. A copy of the foreign pension plan documents should be submitted. The following extra conditions have now been added: Tax treaties between the Netherlands and home countries must allow, among other things, for the exchange of information. The transfer to the Netherlands may not exceed a maximum period of five years. The Dutch Insurance Chamber must approve the continuation of the foreign pension plan. A copy of the employment contract should be submitted. The application must include comparative details of the tax relief available in the home country and of that available to a Dutch employee in a similar position (including the pension formula and the pensionable salary on which pension is based). Further information: Johan Swarts, Valhalla, NY, (1) (914) 745 4279 NEW ZEALAND New superannuation legislation enacted Employers should review their superannuation schemes in the light of two pieces of legislation that were rushed through parliament prior to the October election. The legislation concerns disclosure and whistle-blowing. Disclosure. This is of major concern to superannuation schemes since it requires them to provide new members with an investment statement and make a prospectus available to members on request. The investment statement requires a member to receive specific answers to 11 defined questions; its intention is to enable members to compare the benefits of their scheme with products such as unit trusts, life policies and other retail savings schemes. It will be relatively easy for trustees and employers to meet these requirements. The more contentious aspect of the legislation is the prospectus, which is a more comprehensive document. In future, the regulatory authority will be the Securities Commission, which has wider and more onerous enforcement powers than the Government Actuary who is the current regulator. Although schemes will need to ensure that their prospectus receives proper legal, actuarial and audit sign-offs, they will also need to take a measured approach to avoid unnecessary expenditure. The commencement date has yet to be announced, but it will not be later than 1 October 1997, with an initial transition period of six months. Whistle-blowing. This piece of legislation introduces the requirement for: advisers and managers to disclose information to the Government Actuary if they become aware of a serious problem an independent trustee to be appointed where an employer goes into receivership or liquidation and the employer is also a trustee of the superannuation scheme members to receive on request information about the assumptions and basis for calculations in situations where they are asked to consider a proposed change to their scheme benefits, eg conversion from defined benefit to defined contribution. Further information: Mark Weaver, Wellington, (44) (4) 499 0277 SOUTH AFRICA Defined benefit pension plans under threat Employers who sponsor defined benefit pension or provident schemes are advised to assess carefully the position of these schemes in light of an increasingly hostile environment towards defined benefit arrangements. Those who have not yet adopted a defined contribution benefit philosophy may wish to re-evaluate their position. Issues of particular relevance include the following. Pension Funds Amendment Bill. This requires that all pension and provident schemes make allowance for members to elect at least 50% of the individuals making up the board of trustees of the scheme (see Headlines of December 1995). Pensioners of the scheme are considered as members. The actual election of member representatives can be delayed until December 1998 for existing schemes, but thereafter a minimum of equal representation for members is obligatory. Labour Relations Act (LRA). The exact date of implementation of the LRA is unknown, but will probably be around 1 October 1996. Its provisions require that any changes to the rules of an 'employer-controlled' benefit scheme be referred to a workplace forum for consultation (see Headlines of December 1995). Current interpretation of the Act indicates that all defined benefit schemes would effectively be employer-controlled, because (almost) all rules of such schemes contain provisions allowing the employer a veto over issues such as contribution rate increases, benefit enhancements and possibly investment decisions. Repatriation of surplus to an employer. Considerable uncertainty exists as to whether surplus can be repatriated to an employer and, if so, under what circumstances. Refunds of surplus have not traditionally been permitted, although some precedents for refunds do exist. The authorities do not have a clear position on this issue currently, although they are working towards establishing a definitive policy. Closed defined benefit schemes with meaningful surpluses are particularly affected by this uncertainty. Cost pressures. Increases in the cost of death and disability benefits (which traditionally form part of retirement benefit schemes) as a result of AIDS and other factors continue to cause concern. Many defined contribution funds have an overall cap on the employer contribution rate, thereby limiting the employer's liability. However, cost increases in defined benefit schemes will be borne by the employer unless benefits are restructured, which itself may prove difficult. Similar considerations apply in respect of the 17% tax introduced earlier this year on portions of retirement benefit scheme investment income (see Headlines of April 1996). Benefit levels have not been adjusted to account for the tax (although the impact on defined contribution scheme members is direct), not least because the tax is seen as a temporary measure, the nature and level of which may change in the future. As a result of the hostile environment, employers should consider adopting a defined contribution benefit provision philosophy and closing defined benefit schemes to new members, making use of contribution holidays (where appropriate), extending further options to employees to transfer from defined benefit to defined contribution arrangements, and purchasing appropriate annuities for pensioners. Further information: Ian Patrick, Johannesburg, (27) (1) 269 0661 SWEDEN New company car tax proposed Under a proposal currently being considered by parliament, the imputed tax value of company cars will decrease, and private mileage will have to be paid by employees. However, business mileage will still be reimbursed by employers, and mileage between home and work may be tax-deductible. The impact of the proposal on company car drivers will depend on: whether they use their car mainly for business mileage (favoured by the new system) or private mileage (penalised by the new system) how fuel-efficient the vehicle is. Under the current system, company car owners are taxed on an imputed tax value based on a purchase price decided by the tax authority plus a percentage of the social security base amount. All maintenance costs and private mileage are typically paid by the employer. If parliament votes in favour of the proposal, the new system will take effect from 1 January 1997. Further information: Anders Tapper, Stockholm, (46) (8) 654 1700 TAIWAN New pension accounting standard introduced A new pension accounting standard -- the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No 18 (SFAS No18) -- for pension plans and termination indemnities has been introduced with effect from 1 January 1996. Most Taiwanese pension plans are underfunded because of a weak minimum funding requirement and restrictive investment options. A typical pension plan will cost between 8% and 15% of salary; many employers actually contribute less than 4%. The purpose of the new standard is to provide a more meaningful comparison of pension cost and liabilities among employers and to help the plan sponsor to recognise the true cost of the benefits. The introduction of the standard may therefore lead to: increased funding, or more flexible investment options. The option of reducing plan benefits may not be available to the employer, since the Standard Labour Law mandates a minimum benefit. Further information: Andy Lee, New York, (1) (212) 309 3567 UNITED KINGDOM Surplus refund to be repaid with interest In the mid 1980s, Hillsdown acquired the FMC company, whose employees were members of a contributory final salary scheme -- the FMC scheme. This scheme had a substantial surplus of around 20 million. The rules of the FMC scheme expressly prohibited any repayment of assets to the employer. Hillsdown persuaded the trustees to transfer all the assets and liabilities of the FMC scheme to another scheme (the HF scheme) in return for approximately 1 million of benefit improvements. The remaining surplus was then paid to Hillsdown from the HF scheme. The Pensions Ombudsman found, and the Court of Appeal subsequently agreed, that the trustees were in breach of trust when they made the transfer to the HF scheme because they exercised the power to make a bulk transfer for a purpose -- to allow Hillsdown to take a refund -- other than the purpose for which it had been given. The Ombudsman ordered Hillsdown to repay the refund with interest. This ruling demonstrates the need for trustees and employers to clearly understand their powers and obligations under a pension plan's governing trust deed and rules. While trustees and employers are right to be concerned, they should not be frightened into inaction. There are no reasons why, assuming all parties put comprehensive conduct of business rules in place and receive the appropriate advice, that future plan restructuring or amendments should not be successful. Further information: Philip Christison or Simon Cann, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 New minimum transfer regulations issued Recently issued transfer value regulations, which become effective on 6 April 1997, require that individual transfer values paid to pre-retirement leavers from defined benefit pension schemes are subject to a new statutory minimum. This minimum will be calculated using the prescribed assumptions that are used to determine the new minimum funding requirement (MFR). Transfer payment applications received before 6 April 1997 can be paid using the existing transfer value approach. In addition, trustees will be required to receive written actuarial advice before deciding on the allowance in transfer values for discretionary benefits. This advice will need to be regularly reviewed by trustees. The practical implications of these regulations are that: Transfer values for some schemes will have to increase. The exact amount of the increase depends on the transfer basis currently used. Trustees and employers will need to know before 6 April 1997 whether there are sufficient assets in the plan to cover the payment of these new transfer values. Further information: Philip Christison, London, (44) (171) 379 4411 UNITED STATES New legislation makes wide changes in benefits law After many months of political wrangling, Congress and President Clinton have enacted several pieces of legislation with wide-ranging implications for employee benefits and compensation. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. This legislation which raises the federal minimum wage to US$5.15 per hour in two phases, also contains a 'pension simplification' package that modifies the qualified plan non-discrimination testing requirements and makes other changes designed to simplify the management of pension and 401(k) plans. For example, the law simplifies the definition of 'highly compensated employee' and allows employers who adopt new 'safe harbour' designs for their 401(k) plans to avoid certain non-discrimination testing altogether. The law also makes a number of changes in qualified plan distribution rules that will enable some highly paid employees to collect larger benefits if they retire within the next few years. These changes could bring a temporary increase in early retirements in the near term. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. This act will make health coverage more 'portable' for people with pre-existing medical conditions by imposing new restrictions on coverage limitations or exclusions for pre-existing conditions. The law also guarantees the availability and renewability of group health insurance coverage for all employers, regardless of claims experience. In addition, it clarifies or extends favourable tax treatment to an array of employer-sponsored welfare benefits, including long-term care insurance, so-called accelerated death benefits, employer-provided educational assistance programmes and adoption assistance. Note also that this new law phases out the tax-favoured status of interest on debt used to purchase company-owned life insurance (COLI). Taken collectively, the assortment of relatively modest changes in US employee benefit law made by the new legislation adds up to a fairly significant package of plan design and compliance issues for employers to address. The retirement plan provisions, in particular, merit close examination to assess their impact on an organisation's current programmes and strategy.

SPOT data are visible and near-infrared radiance data obtained from High Resolution Visible (HRV) sensors carried on the SPOT-1 andSPOT-2 satellites. Each satellite carries two HRVs with the capability ofscanning in either a multispectral mode or a panchromatic mode. The multispectral mode captures data in three spectral bands: .50-.59, .61-.68 and.79-.89 micrometers. The three bands are co-registered and have a ground resolution of 20 meters. The panchromatic mode images data in the spectral range .51-.73 micrometers at a 10 meter ground resolution. The viewing angle of each HRV sensor can be adjusted to collect data up to 27 degrees right or left of satellite nadir. This cross-track pointing capability allows the same point on the earth to be viewed from several different orbits and enables the acquisition of stereoscopic imagery. Extent of Coverage The SPOT system provides global coverage between North 87 degrees latitude andSouth 87 degrees latitude. Each nominal scene covers a 60 by 60 km (37 by 37square mile) area. Acquisition The SPOT satellites operate from a sun-synchronous, near polar orbit 832 km(517 mi) above the earth. The satellites are inclined 98.7 degrees, cross theequator at 10:30 AM local time and have an orbital cycle of 26 days. Theground imaging swath is 60 km (37 mi) per HRV sensor. With both HRVs scanningin the twin vertical viewing mode the cross-track swath is 117 km (73 mi).Each HRV sensor has the capability to scan 27 degrees off-nadir (earth curvature effects produce a 31 degree angle) allowing for repeat coverage of an area up to every three or four days depending upon the latitude of the area.The SPOT network consists of 18 worldwide ground receiving stations that acquire SPOT data in a real-time mode. Additionally, the stations at Toulouse,France and Kiruna, Sweden can download data acquisitions during night passes that were recorded on board the satellites. Processing Steps Data acquisition begins when a station's antenna has locked onto the SPOT payload telemetry signal after automatically tracking the satellite from the time it rises above the horizon. The incoming signals received are demodulated,synchronized (8 GHz carrier filtered away) and then recorded on two high density data tapes (HDDTs) operating in full-redundancy. Only one of the two tapes is considered to be a master at any given time, the other servingas a back up should the first develop an error. The HDDT contains all the image data transmitted by the satellite and is thesystem archive. It is not, however, directly usable by researchers. Archiving and inventory operations consist of playing back the raw data fromthe HDDTs, locating the image data, dividing the strip imaged by each HRVsensor into scenes and then creating a directory for the HDDT with this information in it. Following those steps, the SPOT catalog is automatically updated. Each archived scene is defined by the following characteristics: geographical coordinates viewing conditions (multispectral or panchromatic, viewing angle) Grid Reference System (GRS) identification of the scene When a user requests a particular scene, the archived data undergoes preprocessing. Five standardized preprocessing levels are available to the user: level 1A - radiometric corrections level 1B - radiometric and geometric corrections level 2 - radiometric and geometric corrections using ground control points (GCPs) Level 3 - radiometric and geometric corrections using GCPs and DTM level S - radiometric processing and geometric resampling for two scene registration (level S1 when one input scene is level 1B) (level S2 when one input scene is level 2) The raw data are decompressed, corrected and recorded onto magnetic tapes usable by researchers. These tapes are known as Computer Compatible Tapes(CCTs). The tapes are needed to produce full resolution photographic film aswell as being end products themselves.

SPOT scenes varyfrom approximately 27 megabytes to approximately 100 megabytes of data depending on the level of processing and geometric corrections performed. A panchromatic scene consists of a single band image and the 3-band multispectralscene is organized as band interleaved by line (BIL). Image data are recorded such that the first data pixel corresponds to the extreme Northwest corner of the scene; succeeding pixels corresponding to thoseimmediately East of the first pixel, then line by line from North to South.All image data regardless of spectral imaging mode or level of processing arerecorded as right-justified 8-bit pixels.

Logical Volume Volume Directory File Leader File Imagery File Trailer File Null Volume Directory File Products and Services Standard SPOT products consist of digital 9-track tapes at 6250 bpi, 8mm Exabyte and CD-ROMproducts. Special products such as perspectiveview images, complete geologic basin scenes, images corresponding to specificmap areas and special slide sets are offered by some distribution offices. Applications and Related Data Sets Current uses of SPOT data include: preparing basemaps for environmental impactstudies; evaluating major geologic faults and structures; merging SPOT datawith elevation information to produce a perspective view used in geologic exploration; forecasting crop yields; assessing natural disaster damage and preparing thematic maps for cartographic, urban and regional planning or transportation needs.

Appendix Grid Reference System (GRS) Logical Volume Volume Directory File Leader File Imagery File Trailer File Null Volume Directory File Grid Reference System (GRS) The SPOT Grid Reference System (GRS) is used to identify the geographic location of SPOT images. The grid is made up of nodes located at the intersection of columns (K) and rows (J). When data strips are split into scenes, the SPOT GRS links each scene with twoK,J designators representing a node on the GRS. Once the K,J designators havebeen identified for a new scene, they are added to the list of the scene's maincharacteristics file. The Grid Reference System indicates the nominal location of scenes that can beacquired in the twin vertical viewing configuration for any region in the worldminus the polar zones. In the case of oblique viewing, the scene centers donot normally coincide with the GRS nodes (defined by the surveying conditionsof twin vertical viewing). SPOT scenes acquired in oblique viewing mode areidentified by the K,J designators of the node closest to the scene center. The GRS divides the Earth into five zones forming a symmetrical pattern oneither side of the Equator. This division is dictated by the satellite's orbital characteristics and more specifically by the convergence of the groundtracks at high latitudes: The intermediate zone extends from 51.5 degrees North latitude to 51.5degrees South latitude. The north and south zones extend from 51.5 degrees to 71.7 degreesNorth or South latitudes, respectively. The north and south polar zones extend from 71.7 degrees to the poleNorth or South latitudes, respectively. In the north, intermediate and south zones, the K columns are arranged parallelto the satellite ground tracks while the J rows are latitude lines. The pattern of nodes within the three zones is defined in terms of satelliteviewing conditions corresponding to the twin vertical viewing configuration. Itindicates the nominal location of the centers of scenes yielded by this viewingconfiguration. Oblique viewing will place the scene center always on a J rowbut the center may not coincide in longitude with a GRS node. In the two polar zones the GRS node pattern is independent of satellite orbitaland viewing characteristics. The pattern is obtained by hexagonal dissectionusing quasi-equilateral triangles where each side represents approximately 26km (16 mi). The K columns are derived directly from the SPOT reference tracks. Each tracknumber N corresponds to two K columns: K = 2N-1 associated with HRV-1 and located West of track N (odd number) K = 2N associated with HRV-2 and located East of track N (even number) The distance between these two columns (i.e. between K=2N-1 and K=2N) is constant at about 58 km (36 mi) and is a direct result of the twin vertical configuration. Since the GRS nodes are located on either side of the referencetracks, the scene centers obtained in vertical viewing do not coincide with theGRS nodes. This constitutes an important difference from the Landsat WorldwideReference System (WRS), where the nodes are located on the tracks and not oneither side. The J rows correspond to latitude lines (i.e. all GRS nodes at the same latitude share the same J designator). The interval between the rows has been calculated to ensure that endlap occurs between two successive scenes. The scenes of a given data strip are segmented in such a way that the centers are located on two adjacent rows, J and J+1.

Antenna System CRISP's ground station is equipped with a 13-meter solid reflector, 3 axis, X band antenna(32k) for reception of satellite signal. The 13-meter antenna is one of the largest of its kind in Asia. Compared to smaller antenna system, the 13-meter antenna has thefollowing advantages: Superior G/T The 35 db/K obtainable from this antenna provides a wide performance margin above the requirements of all current satellite systems. Superior Quality of Received Signal The higher G/T will result in better quality of received signal, e.g. lower noise level and reduced occurence of drop lines. The 7 degree tilt third axis of the antenna allows overhead tracking ofsatellites at an altitude as low as 400 km, without overdriving theantenna servo system. The whole antenna system is controlled by a sophisticated GroundStation Computer, which enable automatic tracking ofsatellites. Data Processing System The data processing system are based on standard Silicon GraphicsComputers. The host is a 4 CPU Silicon Graphics Challenge,capable of delivering up to 96 Mega-flops processing power. FourSilicon Graphics Indigo2 workstations augment the Challenge host to provide allthe functions of the data processing system. Except for frame synchronisation, all function essential for processingof the satellite signal are implement with software. This givesthe system a high degree of reliability, flexibility andmaintainability. Catalog Browse System CRISP has implemented an WWW catalog browse system for any usersto query CRISP's catalog of data archive. Quicklooks of images received and archived at CRISP (SPOT, ERS and RADARSAT) can also be viewed.

It is also called the "CAP format", since it was produced for the "Centre d'Archivage et de Prétraitement (CAP)", located at Spot Image in Toulouse as well as SSC-Satellitbild facilities in Kiruna. This format concerns the SPOT scenes which are processed at level 1A, 1B, 2A or 2B. This format is upward compatible with the old SPOT Standard Product CCT format and is capable of handling the additional Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) band on SPOT 4. Logical Volume The files in a single SPOT Product Logical Volume are: Logical Volume Volume Directory File Leader File Imagery File Trailer File Null Volume Directory File The files are separated by END OF FILE (EOF) tape marks. The Null Volume Directory File is followed by three EOFs designating an END OF SET (EOS). Imagery records can have a fixed length of one of the following depending onthe length of the image line:          3960 bytes (split record size option)         5400 bytes (line length < 5300 pixels)         8640 bytes (5301 < line length < 8450 pixels)        10980 bytes (8541 < line length < 10880 pixels) To accommodate image processing systems that cannot read large image recordlengths, a split record format is available. Digital scenes produced usingthis option have a maximum record length of 3960 bytes and are only availableon 1600 bpi magnetic tapes. Volume Directory File The Volume Directory File is the first file on any SPOT CCT and contains information about the logical volume. It consists of five records of 360 byteseach: Volume Descriptor Record Pointer Record for the Leader File Pointer Record for the Imagery File Pointer record for the Trailer File Text Record The Volume Descriptor record identifies the logical volume within a volume setand the number of files on this volume. Each Pointer record references one ofthe three data files in the logical volume and identifies the file format usedto read the file. The Text record contains information about the creation ofthe tape and is useful in identifying the tape. Leader File The Leader File contains auxiliary information related to the SPOT scene (identification parameters defining the geometry and the radiometry of the scene, preprocessing data, etc.). The leader file consists of 27 records of 3960 bytes each: Leader File Descriptor One Header Record One Ancillary (Ephemeris/Attitude) Record 16 Ancillary (Radiometric/Calibration) Records One Modelization Record One Ancillary (Ground Control Points) Record Four Ancillary (Histograms) Records One Ancillary (Map Projection) Record One Annotation Record The File Descriptor record identifies the data contained within the followingleader file records. The Header record contains information about the scene identification, thescene characteristics including corner latitude and longitude coordinates, themission, the preprocessing done to the scene and the organization of the Ancillary Data records which follow. The remaining records in the Leader file contain information which can be usedto do further processing (radiometric or geometric) and on the preprocessingapplied to the raw SPOT scene. Imagery File An Imagery File contains one file descriptor record repeated on each physicalvolume in the case of multi-volume scenes and; image data records, the totalnumber depending on the spectral mode and level of processing. The Imagery Descriptor record variable segment gives the number and length ofthe imagery records; how the image pixels are packed, the left and right marginlocations and the size of the prefix and suffix data. The range of valuesfor each pixel is between 1 and 255. A pixel count of 0 corresponds to a nonsignificant radiometric value and is reserved for margins around the imagerydata, and for level 1A bad data lines and dead detectors. Trailer File The Trailer File contains information about the recording of the magnetic tapeand the preprocessing. This file consists of three or more records of 1080bytes each: Trailer File Descriptor One Trailer Quality Record One Geometric Transformation Record One Grid Parameter Record (n) Rectification Grid Record(s) for Level 2 or S scenes Null Volume Directory File The Null Volume Directory file is the last file recorded on a digital SPOTscene. It consists of only one 360 byte record containing a subset of the information recorded in the Volume Descriptor record of the Volume Directoryfile. The Null Volume Directory file is followed by three end-of-file (EOF)markers denoting the end of set.

This level is normally selected by users wishing to obtain information that has undergone the least possible processing. The image appears as a square, leading to a panoramic effect for oblique viewing, as the number of pixels remains constant while the East-West image size varies according to viewing angle. Corrections No geometric corrections are performed. Only detector normalization is performed using a linear model which equalizes the difference in sensitivity between CCD detectors (Coupled Charged Detectors). These basic corrections are systematically performed on all SPOT data. Level 1A products are supplied with auxiliary data: Image acquisition information satellite n° instrument n° spectral band n°(s) GRS (Grid Reference System) designators viewing date and time angle of incidence and image orientation angle geographic coordinates of the four scene corners difference in latitude and longitude between the scene center and the nearest GRS node sun angles (azimuth and elevation). Scene geometry line and column designators geographic marks attitude rates look angles for the beginning and end of the scanline. Scene radiometry gains applied to each spectral band list of dark current values list of CCD normalization coefficients absolute calibration coefficients histogram of radiometric values dynamic range stretching method used and thresholds etc Use This preprocessing level is used in particular for stereoplotting and detailed radiometric studies. Stereopairs are available and usable at this level. Image size Level 1A products can be supplied as full scene or as quarter scene. The image is not resampled. The volume is constant and comprises (for a full scene) 6000 lines each containing 6000 pixels in panchromatic mode, and 3000 lines each containing 3000 pixels in each band of multispectral mode, irrespective of the viewing angle.

Geometric corrections take the viewing characteristics into account. Level 1B corrections have cancelled the panoramic effect linked to distortions resulting from high viewing angles Corrections This level includes the radiometric corrections mentioned for level 1A. Geometric corrections associated with systematic distortion introduced by the system: panoramic effect, earth rotation and earth curvature effects, variation in orbital altitude, with respect to the reference ellipsoid. The geometry of the image is brought to a constant sampling interval. Accuracy The root mean square error in location accuracy is around 500 metres for vertical viewing. The internal relative error on distances is 0.0005 (RMS). Use This level is used for photointerpretation and thematic studies. Image analysis can be performed visually or digitally, with computer assistance. Stereopairs are available and usable visually at this level. Full scene size A Level 1B image is resampled at regular intervals of 10 or 20 metres according to the spectral mode (panchromatic or multispectral). The number of pixels is therefore altered: it varies from 6400 to 8500 in panchromatic mode and from 3200 to 4250 in multispectral mode according to the viewing angle, giving an image size of 60 kilometers in the North-South direction and 60 to 80 kilometers in the East-West direction. The oblique part of the image is obtained by adding zero value border pixels. Format Level 1B products are distributed under the SPOT Standard digital product format.

Corrections The scene is rectified according to a given cartographic projection (conformal Lambert, UTM, oblique equatorial, polar stereographic, polyconic, etc.). The image is also rotated and aligned with true north. Corrections are performed using only satellite attitude data (variations in the satellite attitude during imaging) and imaging geometry without using ground control points (topographic maps are not therefore required). These corrections and the consideration of a reference elevation chosen by the customer make level 2A more accurate than level 1B. Accuracy Although the image's internal accuracy is better (0.0005) compared to level 1B, absolute location accuracy is unchanged (approximately 500m). It can, however, be accurately adjusted by X and Y translation with respect to a known point. Image size Resampling increases both the number of pixels per line and the number of lines, in proportions that vary according to viewing angle and image orientation angle. The rectangular shape of the image is restored by adding border pixels. Level 2A products can be supplied as full scenes or as quarter scenes File Size In panchromatic (P) mode, the number of pixels per line is between 6000 and 10200 (depending of viewing angle and image orientation angle). Since a pixel is coded over 1 byte, the total volume of a digital product can vary between 36 Mbytes and 100 Mbytes (not including border pixels and auxiliary data files). In multispectral (XS) mode, and for each spectral band, the number of pixels per line and the number of lines can vary between 3000 and 5100.

Visually similar to level 2A, but more accurate. Corrections The scene is rectified according to a given cartographic projection (conformal Lambert, UTM, oblique equatorial, polar stereographic, polyconic,etc.). To perform level 2B preprocessing, maps of sufficient accuracy are normally required for acquiring the Ground Control Points (preferably at scale 1:25 000, otherwise 1:50 000 or 1:100 000). These maps must be provided by the customer. If no map is available, control points can be acquired on the ground by a GPS (Global Positioning System) survey. Accuracy Absolute location accuracy can be improved to 20 metres (RMS error) The image is directly registerable with a map. Level 2B products are aligned with true north which involves resampling the image. When stored, pixels are aligned with the map axes, thus considerably facilitating digital processing and product assembly. This level does not, however consider distortion due to terrain relief. The less pronounced the relief and the closer the viewing angle to the vertical, the more accurate the product. In optimal conditions (vertical viewing, maximum elevation difference less than 1250m, location accuracy is specified as 20m (standard deviation). For the most oblique viewing angles, this level of accuracy can only be maintained if the elevation difference does not exceed 170 m.

W-C., Lim, H., Liew, S.C. and Tan, B.T.G. (1996), International Journal of Remote Sensing. (Accepted for publication) The two-dimensional transfer function is derived from the synthetic radar(SAR) imaging model. Using this expression, the approximations made in the classical range-Doppler and recent chirp-scaling algorithms are examined. An alternative algorithm to the chirp-scaling algorithm is presented. Unlike the chirp-scaling algorithm, this algorithm does not require the transmitted signal to be a linear FM signal and can be easily incorporated into processors using the range-Doppler algorithm. The processing starts with range compressed data rather than from the raw SAR data. Results from processing simulated point targets and the Seasat Goldstone area data show comparable image quality. GEOCODING OF SPACEBORNE SAR IMAGERY Kwoh L.K. (1995), Proceedings of Seminar on the Integration of Remote Sensing and GIS forApplications in South East Asia, (27-29 March 95, K.L., Malaysia) In GIS applications, one often has to register remote sensing imagesto the map. Standard GIS packages usually include polynomial warpingfunctions to resample images to the map with some manually selectedcontrol points. Although such warping methods can gives satisfactoryresults, they have the following drawbacks: large number of control points are required; parameters are not related to any physical phenomena; lack robustness to errors in control points; not reliable when extrapolated. In this paper, a geocoding algorithm for spaceborne SAR images basedon a rigorous model of the imaging process is described. The model isbased on the following considerations: SAR signal acquisition and processing geometry; Spacecraft orbital geometry. The imaging geometry of SAR is different from that of optical sensorsin many ways. Optical imaging process is governed by the renownedcollinearity condition (similar to aerial photography). For SARimagery, each image line is formed by the backscatter of a radar pulsefrom ground features. While travelling along in the spacecraft, the SARemits thousands of pulses per second, with each pulse contributing toone image line. Ideally, the pulses are sent out in a directionperpendicular to the flight path of the spacecraft. But smalldeviations (squint) exists and this squint gives rise to a shear in theSAR image. For modelling of the spacecraft orbital geometry, an elliptical orbitthat satisfies zeroth order Keppler's laws is used. This orbit isdefined by the following 6 elements: ( a, e, I, w, v, Om ) which denote respectively the semi-major axis, eccentricity,inclination, perigee argument, anomaly and longitude of ascending node. For an image which is captured over only a small arc of the orbit, itis more practical and more accurate to use the following modified setof orbital elements: ( p, I, W, Om, ex, ey ) which denote respectively the distance from centre of the earth tospacecraft, inclination, spacecraft argument, longitude of ascendingnode, e cos(w), e sin(w). The combined model has between 8 to 12 parameters. The parameters canusually be computed with reasonably high accuracy from the ephemerisinformation given in the imagery leader file (CEOS format). Geocodingusing only the ephemeris information can give relative accuracy of about 200 m. Higher accuracy (less than 10m) can be achieved if the parameters arerefined with known ground control points. DETERMINATION OF FRACTAL DIMENSION OF LOCAL AREAS IN IMAGES Lim H., Lai C.H. and Oh G.L. (1995), Submitted to Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1995. Natural objects tends to have a fractal structure, and such fractalstructure is often reflected in their images. A main parameter thatcharacterises a fractal object is the fractal dimension. Estimatedfractal dimension of local areas of an image has been shown to beeffective for discriminating natural and man-made objects. In thecontext of remote sensing image classification, fractal dimension maybe considered a supplementary parameter for description of the localtexture of the image. Since natural terrain features are the maincontents of remote sensing images, fractal models may be quiteappropriate, and parameters such as fractal dimension may prove to beimportant. Many methods are available for estimation of the fractal dimension ofcurves and surfaces, such as the box method, variation method, spectralmethod, multi-resolution analysis method, etc. These methods have beenderived from the alternative mathematical definitions of fractaldimension, but studies of the statistical characteristics of thesemethods (systematic error and standard deviation) have seldem beenreported. Furthermore, these methods often assume that a large numberof pixels is available for the estimation of the fractal dimension. In image analysis, where local fractal dimension is required, thefractal dimension may have to be estimated from windows of size 32x32,or even smaller. It is not clear if the standard methods are able toprovide a robust estimate of the local fractal dimension. In this paper, a thorough investigation of the systematic errors andstatistical variance of the estimators of fractal dimension is carriedout. Fractal curves and surfaces generated by the fractal Brownianmotion method, the Weierstrass Mandelbrot Cosine functions, and thefractal interpolation method are used as test data sets. Threeestimators are compared: variational method, multi-resolution methodbased on Haar wavelet basis, and multi-resolution method based onLemarie wavelet basis. Based on the analysis of thousands of fractalcurves and surfaces, the following conclusions are drawn: The fractal dimension estimated by the multi-resolution method based on the Haar basis is superior to that by the multi-resolution method based on the Lemarie basis. Significant systematic errors are observed in all the estimators, which ranges from about 0.1 for estimates with 2048 pixels to 0.3 for estimates with 64 pixels. For curves, 2048 pixels are needed to reduce the standard deviation of the estimate to 0.1. With 128 pixels, the standard deviation increases to 0.2. The estimates by the variation method and the multi-resolution method exhibit opposing trends in systematic errors and statistical variances. Based on conclusion (5) above, a new estimator for the fractaldimension is devised by combining the variation and multi-resolutionmethods. With this new estimator, the systematic error is reduced tobelow 0.02, and the standard deviation to below 0.1 with only 128pixels for fractal curves. For images, a 32x32 window is adequate forestimation of the fractal dimension to an accuracy of 0.1. TWO NEW PRACTICAL METHODS FOR PHASE UNWRAPPING Lim H., Xu, W., and Huang X. (1995), Submitted to Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1995. In phase unwrapping, an error made at a pixel has a tendency to spreadand corrupt the phase values over large areas of an interferogram. Itis therefore important that a phase unwrapping algorithm be designedwith a mechanism to stop itself from unwrapping across a pixel at whichthe phase cannot be determined with confidence. Two new phaseunwrapping methods incorporating this requirement and have been foundto be capable of unwrapping reasonably noisy SAR interferograms arereported in this paper. The first method is based on a simple prediction scheme and the secondmethod is based on consideration of local geometry. In both of thesemethods, the phase unwrapping process begins at a location where thephase pattern is relatively flat, thus enabling confident determinationof the phase values of the local pixels. Phase unwrapping thenproceeds by estimating the phases of the pixels in the immediateneighbourhood, and in this manner gradually enlarge the region ofunwrapped phase. In the first method, the pixels of an interferogram are classified intofour categories: unwrapped, growth, bad, unprocessed. An unwrappedpixel is one whose phase has been determined. The phase of anunwrapped pixel is fixed and will not be changed in subsequentprocessing. A pixel adjacent to a newly unwrapped pixel, if notalready unwrapped, will become a growth pixel. A pixel at which anattempt at unwrapping fails will be marked a bad pixel. A bad pixelwill be revived as a growth pixel if any one of its eight neighbouringpixels is subsequently unwrapped. All the remaining pixels in theinterferogram are classified as unprocessed pixels. At each growth pixel, an attempt to determine its phase is carried outas follows. First a predicted phase for the growth pixel is computedbased on the unwrapped pixels in its neighbourhood. Along each of theeight directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) radiating awayfrom the growth pixel, the status of the first two neighbouring pixelsis checked. If only the immediate neighbouring pixel is an unwrappedpixel, the phase of this pixel contributes itself to the predictedphase at a half weight. If both pixels are unwrapped pixels, thelinearly extrapolated phase value contributes to the predicted phaseat a full weight. The standard deviation of the contributions aboutthe predicted phase is also calculated. If the standard deviation islarger than a specified criterion, implying inconsistency in thepredictions from different directions, the attempt is aborted and thepixel is marked bad. Otherwise, an unwrapped phase is calculated basedon the predicted phase. If the unwrapped phase deviates from thepredicted phase by more than a specified criterion, the attempt isaborted and the pixel is marked bad. If the attempt passes both ofthe above tests, the growth pixel is promoted to an unwrapped pixel,with its phase fixed at the computed unwrapped phase. All theunprocessed or bad pixels adjacent to this newly unwrapped pixel arethen marked as growth pixels and queued for processing. In the second method, the basic assumption is that after properunwrapping, the phase values of the pixels in a 3x3 window may beclosely approximated locally by a plane. Suppose all but one pixel inthe window have been properly unwrapped,then we may find that by addingor subtracting 2 pi to the phase of that pixel, a better fitting planecan be found. Based on this idea, and adopting the mean-square erroras a measure of goodness of fit, expressions have been derived forunwrapping up to three pixels simultaneously, provided they all lie onone edge of the 3x3 window. An algorithm for phase unwrapping has beendeveloped in which the window is pushed in various directions acrossthe boundary of an unwrapped region, thereby allowing the phases of thepixels on its forward edge to be determined. For error control, it wasfound beneficial to push the window in a direction nearly normal to thegradient of the local plane, so that the rate of phase change will beminimised. To prevent unwrapping across pixels of uncertain phase, afew parameters are monitored in the process: mean-square error of theplane-fitting, the gradients and intercept of the fitted plane. Alarge mean-square error, or sharp changes in the gradients or interceptof the fitted plane are all indicative of difficulty in unwrapping thephases along that particular direction.  TEXTURE ANALYSIS OF SAR IMAGES Liew S.C., Lim H, Tay G.K. and Kwoh L.K. (1995), Submitted to Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1995. It has been generally recognized that different techniques are required for interpretation of SAR and optical images. Different physical mechanisms are involved in their image formation process. SAR is a coherent imaging process which introduces speckle noise. Unlike optical images, SAR images usually have resolution comparable to the objects of interest. Due to these limitations, it is not sufficient to interpret SAR images based on the local values of grey levels alone. In this paper, we attempt to use texture features in the interpretation of SAR images. Several measures of texture features have been proposed in the literature. Among them are the co-occurrence matrix, grey-level difference statistics, texture energy measures and fractal characteristics. The fractal characteristics are promising features for texture classification since it has been known that many natural surfaces are fractal in nature. It is thus possible to distinguish man-made objects from natural ones from their fractal signatures, and to differentiate between different natural regions. The fractal dimension is one of the most important parameters for characterising fractal surfaces. There are several techniques for estimating the fractal dimension of a given fractal surface. Two of the techniques, namely the variation method and the multiresolution wavelet method, are used in our work. Phase-Unwrapping of SAR Interferogram wiht Multi-Frequency or Multi-Baseline Xu,W., Chang E.C., Kwoh L.K., Lim H and Heng W.C.A.(1994) Proceed. Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1994, pp 730-732. Accurate determination of terrain height by SAR interferometry depends onreliable phase-unwrapping method. The phase-unwrapping methods in commonuse are often based on teh assumption that the phase difference betweenneighbouring pixels is less than pi. Such phase unwarpping methods cannotcorrectly process interferograms over steep terrain, especially in thepresences of noise. This paper proposes a phase unwrapping mehtod based on two or more sets ofinterferograms. After removing an approximately linear term, the terrainheight can be shown to be proportional to the unwrapped phase. With theproportional constant being a function of the carrier frequency and thebaseline. Interferograms of the same area formed with different baselineswill therefore have different proportional constants and show fringes ofdifferent intervals. When the fringe intervals are simple rational ratio,it can be shown that by combining the two interferograms, we can effectivelygenerate an interferogram with a fringe interval equal to the least commonmultiple of the two original fringe intervals. This significant lengtheningof the phase wrap interval practically resolves the phase wrap ambiguity andenable correct processing of steep terrain interferograms even in thepresence of moderate noise. In general, the fringe intervals are not in simplerational ratio, but a slight adaptation of the methods allows similar effectto be achieved. Experiments with simulated data has yielded encouraging results. Withexisting data, our experience showed that multiple baseline processing isfeasible. Our analysis also suggests the possibility of designingmultiple frequency INSAR system with judicially chosen frequencies toprovide reliable terrain height data. DTM GENERATION FROM 35-DAY REPEAT PASS ERS-1 INTERFEROMETRY Kwoh L.K., Chang E.C., Heng W.C.A. and Lim H.(1994) Proceed. Int. Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 1994, pp 2288-2290. This paper presents the authors' experience in DTM generation withERS-1 data of the region around Canberra, Australia. Single look complex (SLC) images were generated by both thetraditional range-Doppler method and the chirp scaling method.The interferograms obtained showed large regions of severe `noise'due probably to the temporal decorrelation of the ERS-1 imageswhich were taken 35 days apart. The temporal decorrelationalso affected the image registration process. Amplitude correlationtechnique has been found to be more effective than the commonly usedcomplex correlation and phase fluctuation techniques for registrationof these images. An adaptive algorithm that takes intoconsideration the terrain slope and the quality of interferometric phase has been developed for smoothing the phase images.

Some examples of elements are heads, tables, paragraphs,and lists. Think of it this way: you use HTML tags to mark the elementsof a file for your browser. Elements can contain plain text, otherelements, or both. To denote the various elements in an HTML document, you use tags.HTML tags consist of a left angle bracket (<),a tag name, and a right angle bracket (>). Tags are usually paired (e.g., <H1> and </H1>) to start and end the tag instruction. The endtag looks just like the start tag except a slash (/) precedes thetext within the brackets. HTML tags are listed below. Some elements may include an attribute, which is additional information that is included inside the start tag. For example, you can specify the alignment of images (top,middle, or bottom) by including the appropriate attribute with the image source HTML code.Tags that have optional attributes are noted below. NOTE: HTML is not case sensitive. <title> is equivalent to <TITLE> or <TiTlE>. There are afew exceptions noted in Escape Sequences below. Not all tags are supported by all World Wide Web browsers. If a browserdoes not support a tag, it (usually) just ignores it. The Minimal HTML Document Every HTML document should contain certain standard HTML tags. Each document consists of head and body text. The head containsthe title, and the body contains the actual text that is madeup of paragraphs, lists, and other elements. Browsers expectspecific information because they are programmed according to HTMLand SGML specifications. Required elements are shown in this sample bare-bones document:     <html>    <head>    <TITLE>A Simple HTML Example</TITLE>    </head>    <body>    <H1>HTML is Easy To Learn</H1>    <P>Welcome to the world of HTML.     This is the first paragraph. While short it is     still a paragraph!</P>    <P>And this is the second paragraph.</P>    </body>    </html> The required elements are the <html>, <head>, <title>,and <body> tags (and their corresponding end tags). Because youshould include these tags in each file, you might want to create atemplate file with them. (Some browsers will format your HTML file correctlyeven if these tags are not included. But some browsers won't! So make sureto include them.) Click to see the formatted versionof the example. A longer example is also available but you should read through the rest of the guide beforeyou take a look. This longer-example file contains tags explained in the next section. A Teaching Tool To see a copy of the file that your browser reads to generate the information in your current window, select View Source (or the equivalent)from the browser menu.The file contents, with all the HTML tags, are displayed in a new window. This is an excellent wayto see how HTML is used and to learn tips and constructs. Of course, the HTML might not be technically correct. Once you become familiar with HTMLand check the many online and hard-copy references on the subject, youwill learn to distinguish between "good" and "bad" HTML. Remember that you can savea source file with the HTML codes and use it as a template for one of your Web pages or modifythe format to suit your purposes. Markup Tags HTML This element tells your browser that the file contains HTML-coded information.The file extension .html also indicates this an HTMLdocument and must be used. (If you are restricted to 8.3 filenames (e.g., LeeHome.htm, use only .htm for your extension.) HEAD The head element identifies the first part of your HTML-coded document that contains the title. The title is shown as part of your browser's window (see below). TITLE The title element contains your document title and identifiesits content in a global context. The title is displayed somewhere on the browser window (usually at the top), but not within the text area. The title is also what is displayed on someone's hotlist or bookmark list, so choose something descriptive,unique, and relatively short. A title is also used during a WAIS search of a server. For example, you might include a shortened title of a book along withthe chapter contents: NCSA Mosaic Guide (Windows): Installation.This tells the software name, the platform, and the chapter contents, which is more useful than simply calling the document Installation.Generally you should keep your titles to 64 characters or fewer. BODY The second--and largest--part of your HTML document is the body, which contains the content of your document (displayed within the text area of yourbrowser window). The tags explained below are used within the body of yourHTML document. Headings HTML has six levels of headings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1 beingthe most prominent. Headings are displayed in larger and/or bolderfonts than normal body text. The first heading in each document shouldbe tagged <H1>. The syntax of the heading element is: <Hy>Text of heading</Hy> where y is a number between 1 and 6 specifying the levelof the heading. Do not skip levels of headings in your document. For example, don't start with a level-one heading (&ltH1>) and then next use a level-three (<H3>)heading. Paragraphs Unlike documents in most word processors, carriage returns in HTMLfiles aren't significant. So you don't have to worry about how longyour lines of text are (better to have them fewer than 72 characters long though). Word wrapping can occur at any point in yoursource file, and multiple spaces are collapsed into a single space byyour browser. In the bare-bones example shown in the Minimal HTML Document section, the first paragraph is coded as     <P>Welcome to the world of HTML.     This is the first paragraph.     While short it is    still a paragraph!</P> In the source file there is a line break between the sentences. AWeb browser ignores this line break and starts a new paragraph onlywhen it encounters another <P> tag. Important: You must indicate paragraphs with <P> elements. A browserignores any indentations or blank lines in the source text. Without<P> elements, the document becomes one large paragraph. (Oneexception is text tagged as "preformatted," which is explained below.)For example, the following would produce identical output as the first bare-bones HTML example:     <H1>Level-one heading</H1> <P>Welcome to the world of HTML. This is the     first paragraph. While short it is still a    paragraph! </P> <P>And this is the second paragraph.</P> To preserve readability in HTML files, put headings on separate lines, use a blank line or two where it helps identify the start of a new section, and separate paragraphs with blank lines(in addition to the <P> tags). These extra spaces will helpyou when you edit your files (but your browser will ignore the extraspaces because it has its own set of rules on spacing that do not dependon the spaces you put in your source file). NOTE:The </P> closing tag can be omitted. This is because browsers understand that when they encounter a<P> tag, it implies that there is an end to the previousparagraph. Using the <P> and </P> as a paragraph container means that you can center a paragraph by including the ALIGN=alignmentattribute in your source file.     <P ALIGN=CENTER>    This is a centered paragraph. [See the formatted version below.]    </P> This is a centered paragraph. Lists HTML supports unnumbered, numbered, and definition lists. You can nest liststoo, but use this feature sparingly because too many nested items can get difficult to follow. Unnumbered Lists To make an unnumbered, bulleted list, start with an opening list <UL> (for unnumberedlist) tag enter the <LI> (list item) tag followed by the individual item; no closing </LI> tag is needed end the entire list with a closing list </UL> tag Below is a sample three-item list:     <UL>    <LI> apples    <LI> bananas    <LI> grapefruit    </UL> The output is: apples bananas grapefruit The <LI> items can contain multiple paragraphs.Indicate the paragraphs with the <P> paragraphtags. Numbered Lists A numbered list (also called an ordered list, from which the tag namederives) is identical to an unnumbered list, except it uses <OL>instead of <UL>. The items are tagged using thesame <LI> tag. The following HTML code:     <OL>    <LI> oranges    <LI> peaches    <LI> grapes    </OL> produces this formatted output: oranges peaches grapes Definition Lists A definition list (coded as <DL>) usually consists of alternating a definition term (codedas <DT>) and a definition definition (coded as <DD>).Web browsers generally format the definition on a new line. The following is an example of a definition list:     <DL>    <DT> NCSA    <DD> NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,         is located on the campus of the University of Illinois          at Urbana-Champaign.     <DT> Cornell Theory Center    <DD> CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca,         New York.     </DL> The output looks like: NCSA NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, is located on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Cornell Theory Center CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The <DT> and <DD> entries cancontain multiple paragraphs (indicated by <P> paragraphtags), lists, or other definition information. The COMPACT attribute can be used routinely in case your definitionterms are very short. If, for example, you are showing some computer options, the options may fit on the same line as the start of the definition. <DL COMPACT><DT> -i<DD>invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows using the initialization file defined in the path<DT> -k<DD>invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows in kiosk mode</DL> The output looks like: -i invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows using the initialization file defined in the path. -k invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows in kiosk mode. Nested Lists Lists can be nested. You can also have a numberof paragraphs, each containing a nested list, in a single list item. Here is a sample nested list:     <UL>    <LI> A few New England states:        <UL>        <LI> Vermont        <LI> New Hampshire        <LI> Maine        </UL>    <LI> Two Midwestern states:        <UL>        <LI> Michigan        <LI> Indiana        </UL>    </UL> The nested list is displayed as A few New England states: Vermont New Hampshire Maine Two Midwestern states: Michigan Indiana Preformatted Text Use the <PRE> tag (which stands for "preformatted")to generate text in a fixed-width font. This tag also makes spaces, new lines,and tabs significant (multiple spaces are displayedas multiple spaces, and lines break in the same locations as in thesource HTML file). This is useful for program listings, among other things. For example,the following lines:     <PRE>      #!/bin/csh                                 cd $SCR                                   cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f         cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile         fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f                 mya.out                                    cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile       rm *                                    </PRE> display as:       #!/bin/csh                                 cd $SCR                                   cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f         cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile         fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f                 mya.out                                    cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile       rm * The <PRE> tag can be used with an optional WIDTH attribute that specifiesthe maximum number of characters for a line. WIDTH also signals your browserto choose an appropriate font and indentation for the text. Hyperlinks can be used within <PRE> sections. Youshould avoid using other HTML tags within <PRE>sections, however. Note that because <, >, and & have special meanings in HTML,you must use their escape sequences (&lt;, &gt;,and &amp;, respectively) to enter these characters.See the section Escape Sequences for more information. Extended Quotations Use the <BLOCKQUOTE> tag to include lengthy quotations ina separate block on the screen. Most browsers generally change the marginsfor the quotationto separateit from surrounding text. In the example:     <BLOCKQUOTE>    <P>Omit needless words.</P>    <P>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no      unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the      same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a      machine no unnecessary parts.</P>    --William Strunk, Jr., 1918    </BLOCKQUOTE> the result is: Omit needless words. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. --William Strunk, Jr., 1918 Addresses The <ADDRESS> tag is generally used to specify theauthor of a document, a way to contact the author (e.g., anemail address), and a revision date. It is usually the last item in a file. For example, the last line of the online version of this guide is:     <ADDRESS>    A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu / revised April 96    </ADDRESS> The result is: A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu / revised April 96 NOTE: <ADDRESS> is notused for postal addresses. See "Forced Line Breaks" below tosee how to format postal addresses. Forced Line Breaks/Postal Addresses The <BR> tag forces a line break with no extra (white) spacebetween lines. Using <P> elementsfor short lines of text such as postaladdresses results in unwanted additional white space. For example, with <BR>:     National Center for Supercomputing Applications<BR>    605 East Springfield Avenue<BR>    Champaign, Illinois 61820-5518<BR> The output is: National Center for Supercomputing Applications 605 East Springfield Avenue Champaign, Illinois 61820-5518 Horizontal Rules The <HR> tag produces a horizontal line the widthof the browser window. A horizontal rule is useful to separatesections of your document. For example, many people add a ruleat the end of their text and before the <address> information. You can vary a rule's size (thickness) and width (the percentage of the window coveredby the rule). Experiment with the settings until you are satisfied with the presentation.For example: <HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="50%"> displays as: Character Formatting HTML has two types of styles for individual words or sentences: logical and physical. Logical stylestag text according to its meaning, while physical stylesindicate the specific appearance of a section. For example, in the precedingsentence, the words "logical styles" was tagged as a "definition."The same effect (formatting those words in italics) could have beenachieved via a different tag that tells your browser to "put these wordsin italics." NOTE: Some browsers don't attach any style to the<DFN> tag, so you might not see the indicated phrases in theprevious paragraph in italics. Logical Versus Physical Styles If physical and logical styles produce the same result on the screen,why are there both? In the ideal SGML universe, content is divorced from presentation.Thus SGML tags a level-one heading as a level-one heading, but doesnot specify that the level-one heading should be, for instance, 24-pointbold Times centered. The advantage of this approach(it's similar in concept to style sheets in many word processors) isthat if you decide to change level-one headings to be 20-point left-justifiedHelvetica, all you have to do is change the definition of the level-oneheading in your Web browser. Indeed manybrowsers today let you define how you want the various HTML tags rendered on-screen. Another advantage of logical tags is that they help enforce consistencyin your documents. It's easier to tag something as <H1>than to remember that level-one headings are 24-point bold Times centered orwhatever. For example, considerthe <STRONG> tag. Most browsers render it in boldtext. However, it is possible that a reader would prefer that thesesections be displayed in red instead. Logical styles offer this flexibility. Of course, if you want something to be displayed in italics (for example) and do not want a browser's setting to display it differently, use physical styles. Physicalstyles, therefore, offer consistency in that something you tag a certain way will always bedisplayed that way for readers of your document. Try to be consistent about which type of style you use. If you tag with physical styles, do so throughout a document. If you use logical styles, stick with themwithin a document. Keep in mind that future releases of HTML might not supportphysical styles, which could mean that browsers will not display physical style coding. Logical Styles <DFN> for a word being defined. Typically displayed in italics. (NCSA Mosaic is a World Wide Web browser.) <EM> for emphasis. Typically displayed in italics. (Consultants cannotreset your password unless you call the help line.) <CITE> for titles of books, films, etc. Typically displayed in italics. (A Beginner's Guide to HTML) <CODE> for computer code. Displayed in a fixed-width font. (The <stdio.h> header file) <KBD> for user keyboard entry. Typically displayed in plain fixed-width font. (Enter passwd to change your password.) <SAMP> for a sequence of literal characters. Displayed in a fixed-width font. (Segmentation fault: Core dumped.) <STRONG> for strong emphasis. Typically displayed in bold. (NOTE:Always check your links.) <VAR> for a variable, where you will replace the variable with specific information. Typically displayed in italics. (rm filename deletes the file.) Physical Styles <B> bold text <I> italic text <TT> typewriter text, e.g. fixed-width font. Escape Sequences (a.k.a. Character Entities) Character entities have two functions: escaping special characters displaying other characters not available in the plain ASCII character set (primarily characters withdiacritical marks) Three ASCII characters--the left angle bracket(<), the right angle bracket (>), and the ampersand (&)--have special meanings in HTML and thereforecannot be used "as is" in text. (The angle brackets are used to indicatethe beginning and end of HTML tags, and the ampersand is used to indicatethe beginning of an escape sequence.)Double quote marks may be used as-is but a character entitymay also be used (&quot;). To use one of the three characters in an HTML document, you must enterits escape sequence instead: &lt; the escape sequence for < &gt; the escape sequence for > &amp; the escape sequence for & Additional escape sequences support accented characters, such as: &ouml; the escape sequence for a lowercase o with an umlaut: ö &ntilde; the escape sequence for a lowercase n with an tilde: ñ &Egrave; the escape sequence for an uppercase E with a grave accent: È You can substitute other letters for the o, n, and E shown above.Check this online reference for a longer list of special characters. NOTE: Unlike the rest of HTML, the escape sequencesare case sensitive. You cannot, for instance, use &LT; insteadof &lt;. Linking The chief power of HTML comes from its ability to link textand/or an image to another document or section of a document. A browser highlights theidentified text or image with color and/or underlines to indicate that itis a hypertext link (often shortened to hyperlink orlink). HTML's single hypertext-related tag is <A>, whichstands for anchor. To include an anchor in your document: start the anchor with <A (include a space after the A) specify the document you're linking to by entering the parameter HREF="filename" followed by a closing right angle bracket (>) enter the text that will serve as the hypertext link in the current document enter the ending anchor tag: </A> (no spaceis needed before the end anchor tag) Here is a sample hypertext reference in a file called US.html:     <A HREF="MaineStats.html">Maine</A> This entry makes the word Maine the hyperlink to the document MaineStats.html,which is in the same directory as the first document. Relative Pathnames Versus Absolute Pathnames You can linkto documents in other directories by specifying the relative pathfrom the current document to the linked document. For example, a linkto a file NYStats.html located in the subdirectory AtlanticStateswould be:     <A HREF="AtlanticStates/NYStats.html">New York</A> These are called relative links because you are specifying the path to the linked file relative to the location of the current file. You can also use the absolutepathname (the complete URL) of the file, but relative links are more efficientin accessing a server. Pathnames use the standard UNIX syntax. The UNIX syntax for the parent directory(the directory that contains the current directory) is "..". (Formore information consult a beginning UNIX reference text such as Learning the UNIX Operating System from O'Reillyand Associates, Inc.) If you were in the NYStats.html file and were referring to the original document US.html, your link would look like this:     <A HREF="../US.html">United States</A> In general, you should use relative links because: it's easier to move a group of documents to another location (because the relative path names will still be valid) it's more efficient connecting to the server there is less to type However use absolute pathnames when linking to documents that arenot directly related. For example, consider a group of documents thatcomprise a user manual. Links within this group should be relativelinks. Links to other documents (perhaps a reference to related software)should use full path names. This way if you move the user manual toa different directory, none of the links would have to be updated. URLs The World Wide Web uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to specifythe location of files on other servers. A URL includes the type ofresource being accessed (e.g., Web, gopher, WAIS), the address of the server,and the location of the file. The syntax is: scheme://host.domain[:port]/path/filename where scheme is one of file a file on your local system ftp a file on an anonymous FTP server http a file on a World Wide Web server gopher a file on a Gopher server WAIS a file on a WAIS server news a Usenet newsgroup telnet a connection to a Telnet-based service The port number can generally be omitted. (That means unlesssomeone tells you otherwise, leave it out.) For example, to include a link to this primer in your document, enter:     <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">     NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML</A> This entry makes the text NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML a hyperlinkto this document. For more information on URLs, refer to: WWW Names and Addresses, URIs, URLs, URNs A Beginner's Guide to URLs Links to Specific Sections Anchors can also be used to move a reader to a particular section in a document (eitherthe same or a different document) rather than to the top, which is the default. This typeof an anchor is commonly called a named anchor because to create the links,you insert HTML names within the document. This guide is a good example of using named anchors in one document. The guide is constructed as one document to makeprinting easier. But as one (long) document, it can be time-consumingto move through when all you really want to know about is one bit ofinformation about HTML. Internal hyperlinks are used to create a "table ofcontents" at the top of this document. These hyperlinks move you fromone location in the document to another location in the same document. (Go to the top of this document and then click on the Links to Specific Sections hyperlink in the table of contents.You will wind up back here.) You can also link to a specific section in another document. That information ispresented first because understanding that helps you understand linking within one document. Links Between Sections of Different Documents Suppose you want to set a link from document A (documentA.html) to a specific sectionin another document (MaineStats.html). Enter the HTML coding for a link to a named anchor:      documentA.html:          In addition to the many state parks, Maine is also home to      <a href="MaineStats.html#ANP">Acadia National Park</a>. Think of the characters after the hash (#) mark as a tab within theMaineStats.html file. This tab tells your browserwhat should be displayed at the top of the window when the link is activated.In other words, the first line in your browser window should be the Acadia National Park heading. Next, create the named anchor (in this example "ANP") in MaineStats.html:     <H2><A NAME="ANP">Acadia National Park</a></H2> With both of these elements in place, you can bring a reader directly to the Acadia reference in MaineStats.html. NOTE: You cannot make links to specific sections within a different document unless eitheryou have write permission to the coded source of that document or that document already containsin-document named anchors. For example, you could include named anchors to this primer in a document you are writing because there are named anchors in this guide (use View Source in your browser to see the coding). But if this document did not have named anchors, you couldnot make a link to a specific section because you cannot edit the original file on NCSA's server. Links to Specific Sections within the Current Document The technique is the same except the filename is omitted. For example, to link to the ANP anchor from within MaineStats, enter:     ...More information about <A HREF="#ANP">Acadia National Park</a>     is available elsewhere in this document.    Be sure to include the <A NAME=> tag at the place in your documentwhere you want the link to jump to (<H2><A NAME="ANP">Acadia National Park</a></H2>). Named anchors are particularly useful when you think readers will print a documentin its entirety or when you have a lot of short information you want to place onlinein one file. Mailto You can make it easy for a reader to send electronic mail to a specificperson or mail alias by including the mailto attribute in a hyperlink.The format is: <A HREF="mailto:emailinfo@host">Name</a> For example, enter: <A HREF="mailto:pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu">NCSA Publications Group</a> to create a mail window that is already configured to open a mail window for the NCSA PublicationsGroup alias. (You, of course, will enter another mail address!) Inline Images Most Web browsers can display inline images (that is, images nextto text) that are in X Bitmap (XBM), GIF, or JPEG format. Other image formatsare being incorporated into Web browsers [e.g., the PortableNetwork Graphic (PNG) format]. Each image takestime to process and slows down the initial display of a document. Carefully select your images and the number of images in a document. To include an inline image, enter:     <IMG SRC=ImageName> where ImageName is the URL of the image file. The syntaxfor <IMG SRC> URLs is identical to that used in an anchorHREF. If the image file is a GIF file, then the filenamepart of ImageName must end with .gif.Filenames of X Bitmap images must end with .xbm;JPEG image files must end with .jpg or .jpeg; and Portable Network Graphic files must end with .png. Image Size Attributes You should include two other attributes on<IMG> tags to tell your browser the size of the imagesit is downloading with the text. The HEIGHT and WIDTH attributeslet your browser set aside the appropriate space (in pixels) forthe images as it downloads the rest of the file. (Get the pixel sizefrom your image-processing software, such as Adobe Photoshop.) For example, to include a self portrait image in a file along with the portrait's dimensions, enter:     <IMG SRC=SelfPortrait.gif HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=65> NOTE: Some browsers use the HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes to stretch or shrink an image to fitinto the allotted space when the image does not exactly matchthe attribute numbers. Not all browser developers think stretching/shrinkingis a good idea. So don't plan on your readers having access to thisfeature. Check your dimensions and use the correct ones. Aligning Images You have some flexibility when displaying images. You can have imagesseparated from text and aligned to the left or right or centered. Or you can havean image aligned with text. Try several possibilities to see how your informationlooks best. Aligning Text with an Image By default the bottomof an image is aligned with the following text, as shown in this paragraph. You can align images to the top or center of a paragraph using the ALIGN= attributes TOP and CENTER. This text is aligned with the top of the image (<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALIGN=TOP>). Notice how the browser aligns only one line and then jumps to the bottom of the image for the rest of the text. And this text is centered on the image (<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>). Again, only one lineof text is centered; the rest is below the image. Images without Text To display an image without any associated text (e.g., your organization'slogo), make it a separate paragraph. Use the paragraph ALIGN= attribute to center the image or adjust it to the right side of the window as shown below: <p ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif"></p> which results in: The image is centered; this paragraph starts below it and left justified. Alternate Text for Images Some World Wide Web browsers--primarily those that run on VT100 terminals--cannot display images. Some users turn off image loading even if theirsoftware can display images(especially if they are using a modem or have a slow connection). HTML provides a mechanism to tell readers what they are missing on your pages. The ALT attribute lets you specifytext to be displayed instead of an image. For example:     <IMG SRC="UpArrow.gif" ALT="Up"> where UpArrow.gif is the picture of an upward pointingarrow. With graphics-capable viewers that have image-loading turned on, yousee the up arrow graphic. With a VT100 browser or if image-loading isturned off, the word Up is shown in your window. You should try to include alternate text for each image you use in your document, whichis a courtesy for your readers. Background Graphics Newer versions of Web browsers can load an image and use it as a background when displaying a page. Some people like background images and some don't. Ingeneral, if you want to include a background, make sure your text can be read easilywhen displayed on top of the image. Background images can be a texture (linen finished paper, for example) or an image of an object (a logo possibly). You create the background imageas you do any image. However you only have to create a smallpiece of the image. Using a feature called tiling, a browser takes the image and repeats it across and down to fill your browser window. In sum you generate one image, and the browserreplicates it enough times to fill your window. This action is automatic when you use the background tag shown below. The tag to include a background image is included in the <BODY> statement as an attribute: <BODY BACKGROUND="filename.gif"> Background Color By default browsers display text in black on a gray background.However, you can change both elements if you want. Some HTML authors select a background color and coordinateit with a change in the color of the text. Always preview changes like this to make sure yourpages are readable. (For example, many people find red text on a black background difficult to read!) You change the color of text, links, visited links, and active linksusing attributes of the <BODY> tag. For example, enter: <BODY BGCOLOR="#000000" TEXT="#FFFFFF" LINK="#9690CC"> This creates a window with a black background (BGCOLOR), white text(TEXT), and silvery hyperlinks (LINK). The six-digit number and letter combinations represent colorsby giving their RGB (red, green, blue) value. The six digits are actually three two-digit numbers in sequence, representing the amount of red, green, or blue as a hexadecimal value in the range 00-FF. For example, 000000 is black (no color at all), FF0000 is bright red, and FFFFFF is white (fully saturated with all three colors). These number and letter combinations are cryptic. Fortunately an online resource is available to help you track down the combinations that map to specific colors: ColorPro Web server External Images, Sounds, and Animations You may want to have an image open as a separate document when a useractivates a link on either a word or a smaller, inline version ofthe image included in your document. This is called an externalimage, and it is useful if you do not wish to slow down the loading ofthe main document with large inline images. To include a reference to an external image, enter:     <A HREF="MyImage.gif">link anchor</A> You can also use a smaller image as a link to a larger image. Enter:      <A HREF="LargerImage.gif"><IMG SRC="SmallImage.gif"></A> The reader sees the SmallImage.gif image and clicks on it to open the LargerImage.gif file. Use the same syntax for links to external animations and sounds.The only difference is the file extension of the linked file. For example, <A HREF="AdamsRib.mov">link anchor</A> specifies a link to a QuickTime movie. Some common file types and theirextensions are: File Type Extension plain text .txt HTML document .html GIF image .gif TIFF image .tiff X Bitmap image .xbm JPEG image .jpg or .jpeg PostScript file .ps AIFF sound file .aiff AU sound file .au WAV sound file .wav QuickTime movie .mov MPEG movie .mpeg or .mpg Keep in mind your intended audience and their access to software. Most UNIXworkstations, for instance, cannot view QuickTime movies. Tables Before HTML tags for tables were finalized, authors had to carefully format their tabular informationwithin <PRE> tags, counting spaces and previewing their output. Tables are very useful for presentation of tabular information as well as a boon to creative HTML authors who use the table tags to present their regular Web pages. (Check out the NCSA Relativity Group's pages for an excellent, award-winning example.) Think of your tabular information in light of the coding explained below. Atable has heads where you explain what the columns/rows include, rows for information, cells for each item. In the following table, the first column contains the header information, each row explains an HTML table tag, and each cell contains a paired tag or an explanation of the tag's function. Table Elements Element Description <TABLE> ... </TABLE> defines a table in HTML. If the BORDER attribute is present, yourbrowser displays the table with a border. <CAPTION> ... </CAPTION> defines the caption for the title of the table. The default position of the title iscentered at the top of the table. The attribute ALIGN=BOTTOM can be used to position the caption below the table. NOTE: Any kind of markup tag can be used in the caption. <TR> ... </TR> specifies a table row within a table. You may define default attributes for the entire row: ALIGN (LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT) and/or VALIGN (TOP, MIDDLE, BOTTOM). See Table Attributes at the end of this table for more information. <TH> ... </TH> defines a table header cell. By default the text in this cell is bold and centered. Table header cells may contain other attributes to determine the characteristics of the cell and/or its contents.See Table Attributes at the end of this table for more information. <TD> ... </TD> defines a table data cell. By default the text in this cell is aligned left and centered vertically. Table data cells may contain other attributes to determine the characteristics of the cell and/or its contents.See Table Attributes at the end of this table for more information. Table Attributes NOTE: Attributes defined within <TH> ... </TH> or<TD> ... </TD> cells override the default alignment set in a <TR> ... </TR>. Attribute Description ALIGN (LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT) VALIGN (TOP, MIDDLE, BOTTOM) COLSPAN=n ROWSPAN=n NOWRAP Horizontal alignment of a cell. Vertical alignment of a cell. The number (n) of columns a cell spans. The number (n) of rows a cell spans. Turn off word wrapping within a cell. General Table Format The general format of a table looks like this: <TABLE>                                     <== start of table definition<CAPTION> caption contents </CAPTION>       <== caption definition<TR>                                        <== start of first row definition<TH> cell contents </TH>                    <== first cell in row 1 (a head) <TH> cell contents </TH>                    <== last cell in row 1 (a head)</TR>                                       <== end of first row definition<TR>                                        <== start of second row definition<TD> cell contents </TD>                    <== first cell in row 2 <TD> cell contents </TD>                    <== last cell in row 2</TR>                                       <== end of second row definition <TR>                                        <== start of last row definition<TD> cell contents </TD>                    <== first cell in last row...<TD> cell contents </TD>                    <== last cell in last row</TR>                                       <== end of last row definition</TABLE>                                    <== end of table definition The <TABLE> and </TABLE> tags must surround the entire table definition. The first iteminside the table is the CAPTION, which is optional. Then you can have any number of rows defined by the<TR> and </TR> tags. Within a row you can have any number of cells defined by the <TD>...</TD> or <TH>...</TH> tags. Each row of a table is, essentially, formatted independently of the rows above and belowit. This lets you easily display tables like the one above with a singlecell, such as Table Attributes, spanning columns of the table. Tables for Nontabular Information Some HTML authors use tables to present nontabular information. For example, because linkscan be included in table cells, some authors use a tablewith no borders to create "one" image from separate images.Browsers that can display tables properly show the variousimages seamlessly, making the created image seem like an image map (one image with hyperlinked quadrants). Using table borderswith images can create an impressive display as well. Experiment and see what you like. Fill-out Forms Web forms let a reader return information to a Web server for some action. For example, suppose you collect names and email addresses so you can email someinformation to people who request it. For each person who enters his or hername and address, you needsome information to be sent and the respondent's particulars added to a data base. This processingof incoming data is usually handled by a script or program written in Perl oranother language that manipulates text, files, and information. If you cannot write a program or script for your incoming information, you need to find someone who can do this for you. The forms themselves are not hard to code. They follow the same constructsas other HTML tags. What could be difficult is the program or script that takesthe information submitted in a form and processes it. Because of the need forspecialized scripts to handle the incoming form information, fill-out formsare not discussed in this primer. Check the Additional Online Reference section for more information. Troubleshooting Avoid Overlapping Tags Consider this example of HTML:     <B>This is an example of <DFN>overlapping</B> HTML tags.</DFN> The word overlapping is contained within both the <B>and <DFN> tags. A browser might be confused by this coding and might not display it the way you intend. The only way to know is tocheck each popular browser (which is time-consuming and impractical). In general, avoid overlapping tags. Look at your tags and try pairing them up.Tags (with the obvious exceptions of elements whose end tagsmay be omitted, such as paragraphs) should be paired without an intervening tag in between. Look again at the example above. You cannot pair the bold tags without another tag in the middle (thefirst definition tag). Try matching your coding up like this to see if you have any problem areas that should be fixed before your release your files to a server. Embed Only Anchors and Character Tags HTML protocol allows you to embed links within other HTML tags:     <H1><A HREF="Destination.html">My heading</A></H1> Do not embed HTML tags within an anchor:     <A HREF="Destination.html">    <H1>My heading</H1>    </A> Although most browsers currently handle this second example, the official HTML specifications do not support this construct and your file will probably not work withfuture browsers. Remember that browsers can be forgiving when displaying improperlycoded files. But that forgiveness may not last to the next version of the software!When in doubt, code your files according to the HTML specifications (see For More Information below). Character tags modify the appearance of the text within other elements:     <UL>    <LI><B>A bold list item</B>    <LI><I>An italic list item</I>    </UL> Avoid embedding other types of HTML element tags. For example,you might be tempted to embed a heading within a list in order to make thefont size larger:     <UL>    <LI><H1>A large heading</H1>    <LI><H2>Something slightly smaller</H2>    </UL> Although some browsers handle this quite nicely, formatting of suchcoding is unpredictable (because itis undefined). For compatibility with allbrowsers, avoid these kinds of constructs. (The Netscape <FONT> tag,which lets you specify how large individual characters will be displayedin your window, is not currently part ofthe official HTML specifications.) What's the difference between embedding a <B> withina <LI> tag as opposed to embedding a <H1>within a <LI>?Within HTML the semantic meaning of <H1> is that it's the mainheading of a document and that it should be followed by the contentof the document. Therefore it doesn't make sense to find a <H1>within a list. Character formatting tags also are generally not additive. For example, you mightexpect that:     <B><I>some text</I></B> would produce bold-italic text. On some browsers it does; other browsersinterpret only the innermost tag. Do the Final Steps Validate Your Code When you put a document on a Web server, be sure to check the formatting and each link (including named anchors). Ideally you willhave someone else read through and comment on your file(s) before you consider a documentfinished. You can run your coded files through an HTML validation service that will tell you if your code conforms to accepted HTML. If you are not sure your coding conforms to HTML specifications, thiscan be a useful teaching tool. Fortunately the service lets you select the levelof conformance you want for your files (i.e., strict, level 2, level 3). If youwant to use some codes that are not officially part of the HTML specifications,this latitude is helpful. Dummy Images When an <IMG SRC> tag points to an image that does notexist, a dummy image is substituted by your browser software. When this happens during your final review of your files, make sure thatthe referenced image does in fact exist, that the hyperlink has thecorrect information in the URL, and that the file permission is setappropriately (world-readable). Then check online again! Update Your Files If the contents of a file are static (such as a biography of George Washington),no updating is probably needed. But for documentsthat are time sensitive or covering a field that changes frequently, remember to update your documents! Updating is particularly important when thefile contains information such as a weekly schedule or a deadline for a program funding announcement. Remove out-of-date files or note why something thatappears dated is still on a server (e.g., the program requirements will remainthe same for the next cycle so the file is still available as an interim reference). Browsers Differ Web browsers display HTML elements differently. Remember that not all codes used in HTML files are interpreted by allbrowsers. Any code a browser does not understand is usually ignored though. You could spend a lot of time making your file "look perfect" using yourcurrent browser. If you check that file using another browser, it will likelydisplay (a little or a lot) differently. Hence these words of advice: code your files using correct HTML. Leave the interpreting to the browsers and hope for the best. Commenting Your Files You might want to include comments in your HTML files. Comments in HTML are likecomments in a computer program--the text you enter is not used by the browser inany formatting and is not directly viewable by the reader just as computerprogram comments are not used and are not viewable. The comments are accessibleif a reader views the source file, however. Comments such as the name of the person updating a file, the softwareand version used in creating a file, or the date that a minor edit was made are the norm. To include a comment, enter:     <!-- your comments here --> You must include the exclamation mark and the hyphens as shown.

Synthetic Aperture Radar. An active microwave instrument, producinghigh-resolution imagery of the Earth's surface in all weather. There is a good introduction to imaging radar by Tony Freeman of JPL athttp://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/desc/imagingradarv3.html What are the main SAR platforms? Several past, present and future Earth Observation Satellites. Alsothe Shuttle Imaging Radar missions. See the tablefor a full list. ERS-1/ERS-2 JERS-1 Shuttle Imaging Radar SIR-C/X-SAR Almaz RADARSAT the future... ENVISAT What distinguishes SAR from hi-res optical imagery?Two main properties distinguish SAR from optical imagery: The SAR is an active instrument. That is to say, it generates its ownillumination of the scene to be viewed, in the manner of a camera with flash.The satellite's illumination is coherent: i.e. all the light in any flash isexactly in phase, in the manner of a laser, so it does not simply disperseover the distance between the satellite and the Earth's surface.A SAR instrument can measure both intensity and phase of the reflectedlight, resulting not only in a high sensitivity to texture,but also in some three-dimensional capabilities. Experiments with thetechnique of Interferometry (measuring phase differences inexactly aligned images of the same ground area) have shown that SARcan accurately model relief, and appears able also to detect smallchanges over time. A paper describing the technique and experiments isavailable at http://gds.esrin.esa.it/A0x0000001c. Some consequences of being an active instrument (and using coherent light) are: Works equally day or night Polarised - can be used to gain additional information (esp. whendifferent polarisations are available on the same platform - as onthe most recent Shuttle missions). Needs a lot more power than passive sensors, and can therefore onlyoperate intermittently. Suffers from speckle, an artifact of interference patterns in coherentlight, sensitive to texture. SAR is Radar - i.e. it uses microwave frequency radiation.(note that in consequence, references to "light" above shouldmore strictly read "microwave radiation").Microwave radiation penetrates cloud and haze, so SAR views the Earth'ssurface (land and sea) in all weather. For general purpose Remote Sensing,this is probably the major advantage of SAR. An example of its use is the ESA/Eurimage "Earthwatch" programme, producingimagery of natural and other disasters when weather conditions prevent otherforms of surveillence. Earthwatch imagery is available at http://gds.esrin.esa.it/CSacquisitions What are SAR images good for ?this wants a better entry - else I'll just point to a bibliographyon the Net Sensitive to texture: good for vegetation studies. Ocean waves, winds, currents. Seismic Activity Moisture content What is the meaning of colour in a SAR image?Of course, all SAR image colour is false colour: the notion of true colouris meaningless in the context of invisible microvawe radiation. Most SAR images are monochrome. However, multiple images of the same scenetaken at different times may be superimposed, to generate false-colourmultitemporal images. Colour in these images signifies changes in the scene,which may arise due to a whole host of factors, such as moisture content orcrop growth on land, or wind and wave conditions at sea. SAR isparticularly well-suited to this technique, due to the absence of cloud cover. The shuttle SAR's images are the nearest to 'natural' colour, in the sensethat they are viewing three different wavelengths, which can be mapped toRGB for pseudo-naturalistic display purposes (essentially the same as falsecolour in optical/IR imagery).

Abel (editor). New York: New YorkUniversity Press, 1995. 450 pp. Cloth $55.00. Paper $20.00. Reviewed by Samuel Krislov, Department of Political Science, Universityof Minnesota When the Law and Society Association was in its infancy, the trustees wouldmeet in someone's hotel room at someone else's convention. I went to economics,psychology, sociology and anthropology meetings that way. Our perennialsubjects at our cuckoo's nest deliberations were raising money and keepingthe Law & Society Review going. We had perpetual differences with ouramiable publisher, a clash of two cultures. Ultimately, the publishers proposedtaking over the review guaranteeing very generous terms. They apparentlythought they had made an offer no sensible individual would refuse. Butto a person the trustees agreed that the review was our primary responsibility,that financial risk was unimportant, that the review was the road to anyviable organizational future. And so it proved to be. When I was asked to review Abel s Law and Society reader, I assumed I wouldbe taking a walk through memory lane, reliving some of those early yearsand the evolution of The Review since then. Alas, that is not to be, forthe reader is a different kind of volume. There are, of course, myriad strategiesof selection from thirty years of a rich and variegated journal. Abel'sstrategy has not been to select landmark articles for their own sake, butrather to assemble a highly useful and surprisingly well integrated classroomvolume developing a small set of themes through generous abridgment of eighteenarticles culled from the review. An introduction and discussion questionsare added as apparatus to help integrate the volume. The themes chosen byAbel are: 1. "Disputing" with four articles dealing with the nature of disputes,perceptions by participants, and the macro uses of law; 2. "Social Control" with another four pieces on punishment andcontrol mechanisms; 3. "Norm Creation" with one piece on criminal and another dealingwith civil processes; 4. "Regulation" with pieces on organizational buttressing of courtdecisions; 5. "Equality" including race and gender considerations and MarcGalanter s "Why the Haves Came Out Ahead," probably the most celebratedpiece in Review history; 6. "Ideas and Consciousness;" 7. "The legal profession." The topics and the selections reflect rather personal approaches. The editingis generous and largely catholic in taste and done in collaboration with,and the permission of the primary authors so that the selections conveythe originals extremely well. However, Abel clearly preferred articles featuringon the one hand individual level anthropological and psychological fociand on Page 229 follows: the other system-wide social inferences, as would be expected by those familiarwith his training, work, and commitments. Even with articles involving "middle-range social mechanisms and withan empirical focus, Abel has, as noted in his introductory comments, drasticallyor completely eliminated graphs and tables except in the article by Radeletand Pierce on race discrimination in prosecution where inclusion of evidencewas of course unavoidable. The result is a volume heavy in "neo-ethnographic"method with lots of carefully manicured quotes, including frequent "uh's","yeah's ' and "ok s" but devoid of solid evidence. Thoseof us of the "for instance is not proof school" of law and societywill not be totally happy with this volume as a teaching tool, but its $20price makes it a great candidate for supplementation with other volumesand/or reprinted articles of a quantitative sort. Political scientists will require especially strong supplementation, formany of our standard topics are omitted. In a provocative introduction,Abel indicates he is interested in all aspects of the law except those involvingrules. This paradoxical approach extends to court structures and formal(and to a large extent informal) relationships among the official participantsin the legal system. Judicial selection and indeed career lines of suchofficials is not covered, nor is any of the literature on decision-making.Some of those gaps flow from the work's core orientation, some an obviousproduct of a desire to keep down the size of the volume to reasonable proportions. There are other costs to the decision to go for classroom use as well. Themajority of articles are from the period of 1986-1990. Galanter's 1975 articleis the earliest one chosen, so that relatively current material is proffered.As a result, many classic articles like Friedman's "A Tale of Two Counties,""Blumberg's "The Practice of Law as a Confidence Game," orMassel's less celebrated article on Social Control in Mongolian Russia arenot represented. Nor are some themes characteristically associated withthe review even mentioned. For example the historical evolution of legalissues (a literature developed out of discussion of Friedman's work), thecase-load and social conditions literature, the compliance with court decisionsliterature are just some topics not represented here. Of course, more coveragewould weaken the coherence which is the reader's greatest asset. Only with respect to the selection on community control do I feel that anobviously stronger article would easily have been found in the pages ofthe Review. In two other instances I suspect that coverage of an articlewon a marginal decision over quality. As to the rest it is obvious thatwhen Abel with his own strong contributions to the study of the legal professionfelt he could only print one piece on that topic (albeit a fine contributionby Sarat and Felstiner) we get a glimpse of the restraints imposed by thiskind of project. One thing Abel manages well and it conforms with his personal exhortationsis to make the volume multi-cultural. About a third of the material is non-U.S.-focused.Apparently he was not able to find much suitable for this volume on Africawhich no Page 230 follows: doubt reflects weaknesses of the review and our crowd, rather than his owntraining and concerns. This volume represents a very considerable contribution to classroom teachingparticularly at the advanced and graduate levels. There has been a slowingdown of the publication of such volumes in recent years and many such effortshave gone out of print. It is therefore doubly welcome especially at soreasonable a cost in the paperback form. In some ways this is a less valuable work for scholars than some of theearly volumes on law and society with only eighteen contributions and alot of space devoted to didactic purposes, but it is also unusually faithfulin its editing (except as noted on the empirical evidence dimension) andtherefore may prove useful to those who wish to gain a first impressionof whole studies rather than snippets dealing with culled arguments andparticularized details. It was obviously a labor of love and the NYU press,the Law and Society Association, the contributors and above all Rick Abelhave all obviously extended themselves unselfishly to make it possible.

McCann, Editor THE JUDICIAL PROCESS: AN INTRODUCTORY ANALYSIS OF THE COURTS OF THE UNITEDSTATES, ENGLAND, AND FRANCE by Henry J. Abraham. Sixth ed. New York: OxfordUniversity Press, 1993. Paper $19.95. Reviewed by Alec Stone (University of California, Irvine) Henry Abraham's THE JUDICIAL PROCESS is one of the few political sciencetextbooks to achieve true classic status. Now in its fourth decade and sixthedition, it has never been effectively challenged on the market. The book'sremarkable success must be partly due to scope, delivering an historicallyrich, institutionally centered overview of the judiciary in multiple contexts.It is also coherently organized -- moving from an introductory discussionof the nature of law, to judges, courts, courtroom procedure. and juriesto whole legal systems, and finally to an extended examination of the U.S.Supreme Court and judicial review. As important, Abraham writes in an engagingstyle, avoiding jargon and mixing abstract analysis with hundreds of fleshand blood examples. Even the notes (and they are blessedly at the foot ofthe page) are packed full of facts and stories, bits of trivia informative,charming, or bizarre. In short, the book provides a readable, relativelyand seemingly) comprehensive account of the role and function of courts. THE JUDICIAL PROCESS is also an old fashioned book. No explicit theoreticalor conceptual apparatus structures the enterprise. No proclaimed normativeconcern informs the presentation. Instead, the author seems to presume thatreaders share a common reverence for law, robes, and courts, and especiallyfor constitutional law, Supreme Court justices, and judicial review. Forthose who believe that the American legal system and constitutionalism arein crisis, the book may seem at best out of touch, at worst an apology.Further, the basic template for this text was cast in the early 1960s, yetthe concerns of many ( most?) public law political scientists have movedfar beyond Abraham's. It is revealing that the book contains no sustainedtreatment of constitutional rights or the evolution of rights politics (thoughAbraham is the author of a book on constitutional liberties that is alsoin multiple editions), the explosion of public interest litigation, of administrativelaw and the regulatory state, or the interaction between courts, legislatures,and executives in the making of public policy. Surely the judicial processis today full of all of these politics, and surely the judicial processinfects other forms of politics. A truly updated version would also discuss how political scientists studyand understand judicial politics. Abraham neither describes nor assessesdifferent schools of public law analysis. Although Abraham deals with various(potential) influences on the Supreme Court's work, there is no debate between,say, proponents of attitudinal models and traditional or new institutionaljurisprudential analysis. There is also no attempt to conceptualize politico-legalculture, or to link "society" with the judiciary. Courts, forthe most part, seem to reside in their own space, and the judicial processis what animates that space. For some teachers, the old fashioned nature of the text may be part of itsattraction. Page 92 follows: One set of criticisms, however, deserves emphasis. Despite the book's subtitle,this is not a comparative work. At most, foreign court systems provide Abrahamwith convenient shadow cases, foils for elaborating on or differentiatingthe American case. Chapter 6, entitled "Courts Abroad," is theshortest chapter in the book (25 pages). The chapter is also by far themost outdated (the reference notes suggest that the French section has notbeen revised since the 1970s). England gets better treatment than France,probably because the American legal system is rooted in common law soil.The chapter actually contains, in the section on French courts, more discussionof American case law than French case law. That this book included any non-Anglo-Saxoncases at all may have been progressive in earlier decades, but not today.Indeed, I believe Abraham's treatment actually hinders our comparative understandingof the political role of courts in the world. Abraham's ultimate focus is on constitutional judicial review, nearly «of the entire text is devoted to the Supreme Court and review. In 13 pagesof chapter 7, the author assesses the status of foreign review systems,which never measure up to "the full majesty and range" of Americanreview (p. '70). The American system is "true," "full,"or "bona fide" review; the Kelsenian model, found in Europe andLatin America, comes off as a strange creature, but only because it doesnot conform to the American model. We need to recognize that American "judicialreview" is only one, comparatively rare form of "constitutionalreview" -- the power of an institution to control the acts of governmentfor constitutionality. In fact, American review is by far the stranger creature:Kelsenian review is now installed in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic,the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia.Rumania, nearly all of the former Russian Republics, Spain, and in manyLatin American polities. In these systems, the ordinary judiciary does nothave the power to control constitutionality, though judges may refer constitutionalquestions to specialized, constitutional courts, which alone possess thepower of review. The establishment of these courts has restructured thework of the judiciary as a whole (though Abraham does not examine the crucialinteractions between the judiciary and constitutional courts beyond statingthat they are "found outside or astride the ordinary court structure"(p. 293). Abraham's discussion of review beyond U.S. borders is riddled with errors,breezy generalizations, and serious omissions. It is not true that the FrenchConstitutional Council is still considered "an adjunct of the Presidentof the Republic" (p. 292), though one could still have made that argumentuntil 1975 or so. In fact, the Council functions as a powerful check onexecutive dominance. It is not true that "the practice of judicialreview in its ultimate and awesome U.S. application ... is not likely tobe found in nonfederal states" (p. 288) -- as the list above makesclear -- unless we are wedded in advance to a restrictive, virtually suigeneris definition of review. It is not true that British courts may notset aside legislation (p. 288): British judges do so, when statutes violatewhat is in effect the constitution of the European Union, a constitutionwhich includes an embryonic bill of rights. It is not even the case thatthe U.S. Supreme Court does more review Page 93 follows: of national or federal legislation than do other courts. According to Abraham'sfigures. the Supreme Court has pronounced only 140 "declarations ofunconstitutionality" in the 1798-1990 period, and only 66 since 1946(pp. 272-87). In its first three decades (1959-90), the French Council haspronounced 87 such declarations; the German Court has reviewed over 20%of ~ federal laws adopted since it began functioning (1951), and has declaredover 5% - several hundred -- at least partly unconstitutional. In brief,constitutional review is flourishing abroad, but the reader would neverknow this by reading Abraham's book. Basic information on, and social scienceanalysis of, foreign courts and review is readily available. In the pastsix years alone, two books on European constitutional law and politics (DonaldP. Kommers on Germany and Alec Stone on France) have been published andspecial issues of four scholarly journals (WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS, POLICYSTUDIES JOURNAL, COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES, and the INTERNATIONAL POLITICALSCIENCE REVIEW) devoted to comparative judicial politics and review haveappeared. These criticisms aside, THE JUDICIAL PROCESS remains an old and useful friend.I assign it in two courses. In my Introduction to Law course, which employsmaterials drawn from legal anthropology, American and European judicialpolitics, and international relations and international law. We read partsof THE JUDICIAL PROCESS as a supplementary text on the American case. Ido not use the comparative sections of the book at all, for reasons stated.In my writing seminar, Constitutional Politics, students divide themselvesinto lawyers, judges, and political scientists, and try a case as a SupremeCourt. The lawyers submit briefs to the Court; the judges draft decisions;and the political scientists analyze the entire process as judicial politics.Abraham's emphasis on the Supreme Court and judicial review works to greatadvantage here, informing the efforts of each group. In chapter 5, the authorguides readers along each stage of the process, from the processing of writsof review to problems of compliance with the Court's decisions. This isAbraham at his best and most entertaining. The author regales students withthe pomp of "this most impressive and most dignified of all governmentalbodies" (p. 188) at oral argument, but also provides snippets of pettybickering between Justices interrupting counsel. We are taken "behindclosed doors," and given glimpses of the intricacies of the Court'sinternal decision-making procedures, the politics of assigning opinions,and the quest for a stable majority in the face of concurrence and dissent.Along the way, the impact of clerks, the solicitor general, amicus briefs,social science data, and even legal periodicals is weighed. In chapters7, 8. and 9, Abraham presents a nuanced case in favor of judicial review,assessing the immense power of review but also its limitations. For thepurposes of my course, these chapters could not be better. The text providesan accessible discussion of the Court, its decisionmaking processes, andof judicial review, pushed at every stage by beautifully chosen examplesdrawn from the institution's entire history. Students not only learn a greatdeal about what they will be doing as lawyers or judges, but they enjoyreading and discussing the text as well. Finally, I strongly urge studentswho are going to pursue a law Page 94 follows: and politics concentration within a political science major to purchasethe book for reference purposes. THE JUDICIAL PROCESS is an extraordinarystorehouse of basic information on the American legal system. thoughtfullyorganized and clearly written.

Cambridge: HarvardUniversity Press, 1991. 369 pp. Cloth $24.95. Reviewed by Robert H. Birkby, Department of Political Science, VanderbiltUniversity. This first of three volumes is one of the important books of the Nineties.Ackerman is attempting to rescue the Constitution and the Court from theirmodernist commentators and to return them to the Founders. To do that hehas to define just what was created in 1787, or more precisely what the"We The People" of the title did by adopting the Constitution. The first thesis of the book is that "We the People" by the Constitutioncreated a dual system of politics, composed of: (1) normal politics or theday-to-day operations of the system where decisions are made by the representativesof the People who should never be confused with The People themselves; and(2) higher lawmaking in which "We the People" act ourselves tomake what Ackerman calls transformations in the system. The function ofchecks and balances, including judicial review, is to preserve the higherlaw's assumptions, procedures, and values until We the People change themat some future date. The dual system means that Ackerman does not have to square judicial reviewwith democracy. Of course, the Court blocks efforts by the legislative majorityto go beyond the values of the Constitution. Of course, the Court even frustratesthe desires of popular majorities when they have not gone through the stepsnecessary to move their lawmaking from the normal to the higher arena. Thatis the purpose of the dual system and no apologies need be offered for theCourt's actions. So far, the argument is in the tradition of Federalist #78. However, Ackermanis not arguing for a static interpretation of the Constitution nor is hearguing that original intent always governs what the Court should do. Therehave been three trans- forming periods in American basic law, periods inwhich higher law was changed, values were altered, and interpretations ofthe Constitution modified. The first is that of the founding itself, thesecond is the adoption of the Civil War Amendments, and the third is theratification of the New Deal by the Court. A trans- forming period mustmeet certain criteria. As he puts it: Before gaining the authority to make supreme law in the name of the People,a movement's political partisans must, first, convince an extraordinarynumber of their fellow citizens to take their proposed initiative with aseriousness that they do not normally accord to politics; second, they mustallow their opponents a fair opportunity to organize their own forces; third,they must convince a majority of their fellow Americans to support theirinitiative as its merits are discussed time and again, in the deliberativefora provided for "higher lawmaking." (p. 6.) Page 55 follows: Ackerman is doing more than saying the transformations are revolutions inthe same sense that Jefferson called his election a revolution, a majorreorientation brought about without guns. There is a fourth characteristicthat he mentions but fails to require which makes these transformationsdifferent from Jefferson's election: illegal or improper behavior. The Consti-tution was adopted by means that the Articles of Confederation would identifyas illegal or extralegal. There are still those who contend that the CivilWar Amendments were adopted through the use of force contrary to the meaningof Article V. And the New Deal was ratified as a response to threats tothe institu- tional integrity of the Court, threats that were real eventhough they did not come to fruition. There is an element of force in eachof these transformations that is missing in the changes resulting from mererealigning elections. The problem for the Court in all of this is adaptation to the transformations.Only the adoption of the Constitution was a repudiation of the past. TheCivil War amendments retained the property rights value of the foundingwhile repudiating the slavery value. The New Deal retained the Bill of Rightsvalue from the founding period and the human rights value of the Civil WarAmendments while rejecting the strong property rights value of both periods.Courts have had to interpret these changes to weave the new in with theold. The Court begins by accommodating the narrow, literal effect of thetransformation while retaining as much as possible from the earlier period,as in the SLAUGHTER- HOUSE CASES for instance. Then a broader interpretationis offered as the date of the transformation recedes into the past and thejudges are no longer those who participated in the change. Thus we get aLOCHNER or we get GRISWOLD V. CONNECTICUT as an extension of the New Dealtransformation. One other major thesis is in the book. If the New Deal is a transformation,it cannot be the mere return to the Constitution or return to John Marshallthat Ackerman asserts conventional wisdom labels it. The only way that itcan be something new is to argue that the post-Civil War transformationwas an adoption of new values which were accepted in their time and thenthat the New Deal changed in a direction other than backwards. The CivilWar Amendments were designed to eradicate slavery while still retainingthe idea of protection of property; they were designed to define slavesout of the category of property. A decision such as LOCHNER, rather thanbeing an aberration, is correct. The New Deal transformation goes forwardas a transformation in the sense of ratifying the activist, redistributing,less proper- ty oriented national government. There is a major problem with the New Deal as a transformation. The shiftfrom the Articles to the Constitution is clear, unarguable, and a majorexercise of "higher law mak- ing." The shift made by the CivilWar Amendments is clear, unarguable, and a major exercise of "higherlaw making." In both cases We the People made it abundantly clear thatwe knew what we were doing (even though some of us did it reluctantly inthe second period). It is not all that clear that the transformation calledthe New Deal was as clear, unarguable, or even an exercise of "higherlaw making." The 1932 and 1936 elections are offered as evidence thatthe requirement for a "deep and sustained popular commitment"(p. 108), a "deep and Page 56 follows: considered support" (p. 195) had been met by Roosevelt. Given the vaguenessand lack of a coherent program in the New Deal and given everything we knowabout the vagaries of voting behavior, it is hard to accept an electionor two as a transformation of the magnitude that Ackerman is talking abouthere. FDR attacked the Court and the Court changed. If the evidence that We the People knew what we were up to is soft, we alsofailed to make sure that the FORM of what we did was clearly transformative.There was only the "switch in time" to mark the transformationand judicial precedents do not have the same finality to them that adoptionsof Constitutions or amendments do. Let me put this another way. The thingthat appears to make the New Deal transformative and the election of ThomasJefferson in 1800 not transformative is that the Court did not change anyof its interpretations for Jefferson and it did change for Roosevelt. Ibelieve it is correct that Jefferson's election was not transforming. Ineed more persuasion that Roosevelt's was. The New Deal just does not seemto fit the requirements that Ackerman sets forth for a transformation. A final troubling aspect of the New Deal transformation is recognized byAckerman but it does not cause him to question whether the transformationtook place. The lack of formality in this transformation has made it possiblefor there to be "transformative appointments" in the Reagan-Bushyears that threaten to reverse the New Deal understandings without the sortof debate and action by We the People that Ackerman wants. Neither the foundingnor the Civil War transformations could be reversed by judicial appointments;the New Deal one can. Ackerman says that this suggests that We the Peoplehave become unimaginative in expressing our wishes. Alternatively it couldbe that We the People wanted out of the Depression and did not really considerthe effects of what we were doing; we did not call for a regime change butmerely short term action. This is an important and tightly argued book. It teems with ideas and challengesto conventional wisdom. It, by a return to the Founders and the discussionof the dual system of politics, solves the problem of the place of the Courtin the American system of government even though many will not like thesolution. It will cause a rethinking of the effect of the New Deal. Is itreally a return to the Founding or does it mark the beginning of a new regime?Finally, Ackerman may trigger a more structured and less ideological discussionof the legitimacy of presidential attempts to make major changes in interpretationby mere appoint- ments to the federal courts. Volume II, TRANSFORMATIONS,and Volume III, INTERPRETATIONS, will round out Ackerman's argument.

Laufer (editors). New Brunswick,NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1993. 406 pp. Cloth $39.95. Reviewed by Michael G. Maxfield, School of Public and Environmental Affairs,Indiana University, Bloomington. This is the fourth in an occasional series of volumes, ADVANCES IN CRIMINOLOGICALTHEORY, launched to fill a perceived dearth of outlets for papers focusingon theoretical issues in criminology. As such, the series resembles morean irregular journal than a collection of related essays. This semblanceis reinforced by the absence of an interpretive introduction by the editors;unlike previous volumes, this one simply begins and ends. Without guidance,one naturally turns to the table of contents for clues about what is tofollow. There are none, save the inclusion of Travis Hirschi's name in thetitles of two chapters. A reviewer therefore faces a task roughly equivalentreviewing the complete contents of an academic journal. The contributionsthemselves are starkly uneven, but a careful reading revealed three loosethemes and three odd papers among the 11 chapters (or 12, including a finalselection labeled "comments.") Introductions to the first and second volume note, but do not quite lament,that academic criminology journals are increasingly dominated by empiricalresearch and discussions of methods. It was felt that a forum for theorywas needed. This is true, but more so for reasons not cited by the editors.Most scholars probably view criminology as a multidisciplinary field; othersfeel it has now become a discipline. In either case some sort of forum forbringing together discussions of theory from the recognized disciplinesthat contribute to criminological research is certainly in order. The presentvolume does this, after a fashion, but more by accident than by design.On to the themes. The first two chapters address theoretical perspectives that could be ofinterest to political scientists, labeling theory and Marxist criminology.In a chapter entitled, "The Future of Labeling Theory," CharlesWellford and Ruth Triplett attempt to make a case that the labeling perspectivedeserves more respect. They link its essential elements to symbolic interactionism:labels applied to individuals are symbols that influence their behavior.Unfortunately, they focus almost exclusively on how being labeled affectssubjective perceptions and behavior, but ignore how the behavior of publicofficials and others toward labeled persons (delinquents, criminals, orjust troublemakers) is influenced by labels. Wellford and Triplett claim that its association with conflict criminologyis one reason why labeling theory has not been more widely embraced. Asif to reinforce this, the contribution by sociologist Austin Turk launchesinto a what comes off as a pep talk for Marxist criminology, which he claimsis misleadingly referred to as conflict criminology. Whatever it is called,in conflict/Marxist theory crime is viewed as an artifact of social valuesand political power, both of which are embodied in criminal law. Politicsinvolves conflict over social and other values. The winners of such conflictdefine certain behavior and acts as crimes, while the losers -- people whosebehavior is rejected -- are defined as criminals. Turk serves up a few interestinginsights, but the chapter is little more than a guide for Marxists on howthey can better handle methodological enemies. Three chapters dwell on Travis Hirschi's (1969) influential work on delinquency.Briefly, Hirschi proposed and tested a control theory (also called "bonding")of delinquency. Various sources of control can prevent delinquency. Parents,peers, and schools are institutions that instill attachment and internalizationof social norms. Delinquency is more likely for males with weak attachmentto parents and school, and stronger attachment to deviant peers. Chapters by Kimberly Kempf and by Marc Page 14 follows: Le Blanc and Aaron Caplan complement each other nicely. Kempf's contributionpresents a meta-analysis of the numerous studies that purport to test Hirschi'scontrol theory. Hirschi fares well on two of three criteria Kempf sets upfor judging a theory. First, public policy since 1969 has shifted in waysconsistent with Hirschi's emphasis on bonding and attachment. Second, themany attempts to replicate or further test various components of controltheory indicate that it has become a subjective standard among criminologists.Third, these subsequent empirical tests yield mixed support. Kempf arguesthat differences in measurement and other methods are responsible for inconsistentresults. Kempf's contribution itself is not especially noteworthy, but gains addedweight from the most ambitious selection in the volume. Commenting on anearlier version of Kempf's paper, Le Blanc and Caplan are not surprisedthat empirical tests produced mixed results, because, they argue, a discursivepresentation of a complex theory invites inconsistent interpretations. Thesolution offered in this chapter is to produce a formal version, since formaltheory more readily reveals internal inconsistencies. After producing aninitial formal statement of Hirschi, Le Blanc and Caplan formulate a revisedformal theory based on: (1) internal inconsistencies revealed by the initialformal statement, (2) results from a careful replication, and (3) developmentsin control theory since Hirschi's 1969 book. With four appendices, this chapter approaches 100 pages in length. But itis potentially useful for two types of readers. Scholars following in Hirschi'sfootsteps, and there are many, will carefully study the formal versions,form their own judgments and hopefully commence further studies. The intendedaudience of this series -- scholars with a particular interest in theory-- will benefit from the general discussion of formal theory and the examplepresented by Le Blanc and Caplan. Many of the second group might be dismayedby the laborious effort required to produce formal statements. But Le Blancand Caplan make a convincing case that formal theory exposes sloppy thinking(though they are careful to point out that Hirschi's theory displays littleof this), and forms the base for more systematic empirical tests, thus avoidingthe anarchy revealed by Kempf. Michael Lynch, Graeme Newman, and W. Byron Groves present the third contributionfocusing on Hirschi's work. Two goals are stated in this chapter; a thirdemerges. First, the authors demonstrate how Durkheim's writings on punishmentas a source of social control are similar to Hirschi's development of controltheory to explain crime. Durkheim was more interested in punish- ment asa policy, while Hirschi focused on how control and its absence inhibitedor promoted individual criminal behavior. The second goal quickly emergesfrom the Durkheim-Hirschi comparison: to demonstrate the conceptual similaritiesbetween control theory and deterrence. Unfortunately, this exercise leadsthe authors to their final goal: a specious claim that punishment cannotpossibly deter crime. Two selections focus on corporate or white-collar crime, a topic prominentin earlier series volumes. The chapter by Edward Sieh is simply a discussionof case studies of employee theft in various organizational settings inEngland. In essence, three forces are at work. First, workers and work groupshave varying autonomy and opportunities for "fiddling." Second,theft and fiddling are promoted by attempts to redress perceived inequitiesin salary, working conditions, and prestige. Finally, small-group subculturescan encourage theft, while exercising informal controls to regulate itsscope. Such observations are interesting and worthwhile to students of employeetheft, but there are no synthetic insights of any value. For example, ina single paragraph, Sieh suggests that other responses to inequity may result,ranging from malingering, through union actions, to: "... politicalunrest and rebellion" (p 108). Sally Simpson's chapter on corporate crime is one of the best in the volume,a true synthesis of organization and economic theory, Page 15 follows: together with historical analysis of industrial technology to explain varyingpatterns of illegal corporate practices. Simpson's paper is especially noteworthyin its departure from most previous ventures into the study of white-collarcrime by criminologists. The latter typically begin by comparing streetcrime to white collar crime, perhaps noting that the dark figure of corporateillegality is much larger and more costly than any number of petty theftsor burglaries. In appealing to other paradigms, Simpson produces severalhypotheses rooted in organization theory and industrial development. Theform of illegality -- horizontal price-fixing and mergers, vertical buyer-sellercollusion, or mixed forms -- depends on dominance by different subunitswithin the organization. Dominance by sales and marketing subunits promotesvertical illegality and false advertising as a firm strives to improve marketshare. If corporate finance departments have greater influence, a firm'sfocus shifts away from coercing customers and suppliers to illegal mergers,and perhaps violations of health and safety regulations. The volume of illegalbehavior will be greatest in sales and marketing subunits, since managersare more attentive to unit performance, not routine operations. The activitiesof sales and marketing units are also less subject to internal scrutinysince they involve a large number of interactions with persons outside thefirm. As firms within a product market become more similar, so do patternsof industry-wide criminality. Simpson supports these propositions by linking the evolution of corporateform and subunit dominance to changes in patterns of illegality and federalregulations. As in all such attempts to explain the behavior of actors inlarge complex organizations over time, the framework is imperfect. But themix of organizational and economic incentives is a more provocative andpotentially valuable framework than attributing corporate crime to evilexecutives, subcultures of deviance, or other explanations borrowed fromtraditional criminology. Of the three odd chapters, two are of little value. Robert Nash Parker offerssome preliminary thinking about how the association between alcohol andhomicide might mesh with four theoretical perspectives on crime causation.Theory-based research on homicide is not well developed, and Parker's failureto provide any new insights is disappointing. A contribution by David Weisburd, Lisa Maher, Lawrence Sherman, and associatesis interesting, but not at all suitable for this volume. The authors examineneighborhood variation in calls for service and attempt to interpret resultsin light of two ill- defined theoretical perspectives: (1) all crime iscaused by similar factors; (2) different types of crime are caused by differentfactors. Results are inconclusive. Jeffrey Fagan's chapter on social control of spousal assault is valuablefor two reasons. First, his review serves as an excel- lent introductionto the large and growing literature on domestic violence, a topic that hasattracted no small number of ideologues. Although Fagan has his own agenda,he does a nice job of synthesizing this literature. Second, there is a subtlebut incisive commentary on the initial promise but eventual failure of arrestas a routine, rather than discretionary, response to domestic violence. Fagan's discussion of experimental studies and replications is especiallyworthwhile in pointing out a fundamental, but too often ignored, flaw infield experimentation. Arrest is not a reliable intervention. Uncontrolledvariation includes length of time in custody, prior record of the arrestedperson, and whether or not prosecution followed arrest. Such treatment irregularitiesobviate the advantages of randomized designs. Furthermore, Fagan pointsout that focusing on actions by police may naively overlook how adaptiveactions by prosecutors and judges can neutralize arrest policies. Such insightswill not be surprising to scholars familiar with studies of trial courts,but Fagan's commentary provides something of a new direction for criminologists. Page 16 follows: Who should buy this volume? It would be misleading and of little value forscholars who are unfamiliar with criminological theory and seek a conciseoverview. Those who know something of the field and wish to learn aboutnew developments will be disap- pointed by the volume's narrow scope. Thevalue of chapters by Simpson, Fagan, and Le Blanc and Caplan does not offsetthe overwhelmingly uninteresting character of the rest of the book. Editorialquality is poor; for example, Marc Le Blanc's name is consistently misspelledin all but his own citations. The title notwithstanding, new directionsare difficult to find in this volume.

Deng (Editors). Washington: The Brookings Institution, 1990.339 pp. Cloth $24.35. Paper $12.95. Reviewed by Matthew Lippman, Department of Criminal Justice, Universityof Illinois at Chicago. Following World War II, the Allied Powers were determined to prevent a repetitionof the atrocities and barbarities perpetrated by the Third Reich. The UnitedNations Charter enthroned the protection of human rights as a fundamentalpurpose of the organization. One of the fledgling United Nations' firstacts was the drafting of the non-binding Universal Declaration of HumanRights which was proclaimed as a "common standard of achievement forall peoples and all nations." The Universal Declaration was followedby the adoption of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishmentof the Crime of Genocide and by the passage in 1966 of two implementingcovenants. The United Nations now has accepted over fifty multilateral humanrights instruments. International and regional human rights systems andprocedures also have been developed and a myriad of national non-governmentalhuman rights organizations have been formed. The protection of human rightshas been indisputably established as being of international legal concernand no longer as a matter which States' may credibly claim to be exclusivelywithin their domestic jurisdiction. Human rights research has lagged behind these advancements and remains atan inchoate stage of development. Initially, the field was the exclusivepreserve of international lawyers who devoted themselves to describing substantivehuman rights protections and procedures. During the second phase, the focuswas on proposals for new rights, such as the collective right to peace.Human rights research recently entered a third phase and has become theconcern of scholars in fields ranging from literature to psychology. Socialscientists have begun to devote their efforts to conceptual issues and toempirical studies of human rights implementation. The early work definingthe nature of human rights and the role of human rights in foreign policyalso has been refined and extended. Nevertheless, the field remains characterizedby uneven and fragmented scholarship and generally suffers from an overlytopical and journalistic emphasis. There is a paucity of solid scholarship,and the igniting of academic interest in human rights has resulted in ascholarly whimper rather than in the anticipated bang. HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFRICA: CROSS-CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES editedby Abdullahi Ahmed An-Nacim and Francis M. Deng is representative of thethird phase in human rights research. It challenges the contention thatinternational human rights documents and claims reflect western ethnocentrism.A persistent thread in the fabric of discussions covering human rights hasbeen the objection that the notion and definition of human rights is theproduct of a western, capitalistic and democratic, secular ideology (criticstypically select one or more of these adjectives from this shopping listof objections). It is pointed out that the Page 2 follows the core human rights documents were drafted at a time when the United Nationswas comprised of roughly fifty, mostly industrialized nation-states. Today,the organization has tripled in size. This increase in membership largelyis due to the admission of former colonial territories in Africa, Asia andthe Pacific. It is alleged that the foundation human rights documents reflectthe bias of the original member-states and that such rights have limitedrelevance to the developing world. This argument is an amalgam of a varietyof cultural and ideological claims: (1) existing international human rightsdocuments emphasize individual at the expense of communitarian rights; (2)secular human rights may not take precedence over divinely inspired patternsof social organization; (3) states should not be expected to guarantee civiland political rights until they achieve economic development; and (4) onlycertain core human rights pertaining to the right to life can claim cross-culturallegitimacy. These four multifarious claims often are animated by an anti-colonialanimus -- a view that human rights merely are another imperialist effortto impose alien values on what are arrogantly viewed as the benighted denizensof the developing world. The fourteen diverse essays in the An-Nacim and Deng volume reject thismulticultural perspective on rights (which is pejoratively characterizedas cultural relativism) and adopt a monist view. The authors variously pointout that, in general, only the remnants of coherent traditional culturesremain and that the world is increasingly becoming one vast uniform urbanizedmarketplace. The African reality is not dissimilar from that faced by peoplesin North America and Europe. The Wiredu and Deng essays document that the notion of rights is not aliento Africa. Traditional African cultures embodied limited human rights normswhich are similar to many of those contained in the allegedly imperialist-inspiredinternational documents. The imperialist claim merely is thought to obfuscatethe central issue; in this new world order human rights are threatened andrequire protection from state repression. Anti-imperialist and fundamentalistrhetoric often merely masks an effort to legitimize such repression. VirginiaA. Leary points out that the charge that contemporary human rights are aproduct of western interests overlooks the fact that most recent documents,such as those providing for self-determination for colonial peoples andthe right to development, reflect the interests of the third world. Thecentral question addressed in essays by An-Nacim and James Silk, is howto gain global legitimacy for the idea of human rights. The next step wouldbe the transformation of those remaining cultural practices which inhibitthe realization of universal human rights and to move towards the humanitarianglobal culture described by Richard D. Schwartz in his concluding contribution. The various authors in this volume focus on a central contemporary globaland domestic issue -- the tension between ethnocentrism and globalization.As the Salman Rushdie controversy suggests, there are profound culturaldivisions in the Page 3 follows world. The book, however, is disappointing. These are conference papersand few are sufficiently original,penetrating or rigorous to merit independentpublication. The reader is required to plow through an overly long, repetitious,and disjointed set of essays in order to reap the harvest of a few perceptiveinsights. At a conference, the discussion period often provides the typeof organizing themes and coherence which this collection so desperatelyrequires. In addition, it was unfortunate that the editors did not includecontributions or rejoinders by the scholars whose views are being subjectedto examination and criticism. The volume also requires some concrete examplesand analyses of the abstract, conceptual issues discussed in the essays.For instance, it is not clear which human rights claims are thought to conflictwith existing and widespread African cultural patterns. To what extent doesthe colloquy concerning human rights in Africa involve a symbolic strugglebetween the representatives of the developed and developing world ratherthan a debate over the substantive protection of human rights? In the end, the underlying themes propelling the book demand a more sophisticatedand coherent treatment. The difficulty of achieving a single standard ofhuman rights in a pluralistic society or world, and the tension betweennationalism and globalism each are grist for the mill of an ambitious author.Based upon the volume's somewhat deceptive title, the reader also justifiablyanticipates discussion of topics such as AIDS, the right to food and development,the rights of women and ethnic minorities, refugees, slavery, apartheid,democratic procedures, state and guerilla terrorism, comparative human rightsprotections in Africa and the establishment of an African human rights charterand court. However, it should be noted that the issues of state repressionand democratic participation are given limited descriptive coverage in thechapters by Claude E. Welch Jr. and James C. N. Paul. Africanists likelywill be disappointed by the fact that most of the essays adopt a broad conceptualperspective and only vaguely touch on contemporary Africa. Of course, itnay have been overly ambitious to aspire to encompass the African realityin a single volume. Few of the essays grapple with the complexity of the cultural issue. Manycontroversial practices are part of an intricate web of social relationshipsand traditions and have compelling societal rationales. These practicesoften are voluntarily entered into by the participants and have significantsymbolic import. The western alternative also invariably has limited appeal.A particular social practice, as a rule, cannot glibly be condemned as violativeof human rights. International human rights guarantees usually are fairlybroadly phrased, subject to qualifying conditions and open to interpretation.Both the Islamic world and the United States, for instance, stand togetheragainst most of the globe in credibly insisting that the death penalty doesnot constitute cruel punishment. The essayists also pay scant attentionto the fact that the West, like the developing world, has claimed ideologicalexemption from Page 4 follows adherence to human rights guarantees. The United States, based upon itsFirst Amendment tradition, remains one of the few countries to resist thehuman rights provision limiting racist and bigoted speech. It also has refusedto recognize the legitimacy of social and economic rights, such as the rightto work, food and shelter. Despite these admonitions, the book is sufficiently unique and compellingin its subject matter to merit scholarly attention. It is a significantmulti-disciplinary analysis of a central human rights issue in one regionof the world. There is little doubt that it will be a standard citationfor academics in the area of human rights. Although lacking a bibliography,the volume provides relatively full citation to the relevant literature.The essay by Washington attorney James Silk is particularly valuable inthis regard. The contributions by human rights stalwarts Jack Donnelly andRhoda E. Howard are the most original, stimulating and valuable essays.Donnelly reinterprets Lockean liberalism to accommodate collective claimswhile Howard launches an effective frontal assault on the African defenseof cultural relativism. The Tibi and Mayer pieces on Islamic law and traditionare undistinguished but solid contributions to the burgeoning literatureor human rights in Muslim societies.

Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995. xx, 466 pp. Cloth$48.50. Paper $16.95. Reviewed by D. Grier Stephenson, Jr., Department of Government, Franklin andMarshall College. Justice Hugo Black was impatient, perhaps annoyed. "I'm not going to write adissent this time. I've written enough on these." George Anastaplo is "too stubborn for his owngood. This whole thing is a little silly on his part," opined Black privately in December 1960. Amajority of the Brethren had voted in conference to reject Anastaplo's petition arising from hisrefusal in 1950 to answer questions about his political beliefs as a condition for admission to theIllinois bar (Newman 1994, 504). Black's irritation was understandable: no one thoughtAnastaplo was a Communist or any other kind of threat to the Republic. Justice Harlan'smajority opinion was factually correct: Anastaplo "holds the key to admission in his own hands"IN RE ANASTAPLO (1961, 97). Nonetheless, Black did write a dissent, defending withoutqualification the petitioner's First Amendment right to silence. "We must not afraid to be free,"he concluded IN RE ANASTAPLO (1961, 116). His defeat in the Supreme Court -- Anastaplo personally argued his case --highlights a curiosity in the professional accomplishments of one whom a former teacherdescribed later as an "adamantly principled philosopher and scholar," adding "any man who iskicked out of Russia, Greece [as had happened to Anastaplo] and the Illinois bar can't be all bad"(Pritchett 1972, 1476). Had the bar committee been more tolerant, had Anastaplo been moreflexible, or even had he won his case in the U.S. Supreme Court a decade later, his career pathmight have been vastly different. Without both his primary and secondary contributions, theliterature on the American Constitution would surely be far less interesting and rich. Expressly billed as a companion to the author's THE CONSTITUTION OF 1787(1989), THE AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION, like its sibling, is based on a seriesof lectures the author delivered to a college and community audience between September 1990and April 1991 in Hickory, North Carolina. Of the 17 chapters in THE AMENDMENTS, fourreview the background and purposes of the Bill of Rights, and nine explore the amendmentsthemselves. Only the First Amendment merits a chapter all its own. In addition discretechapters explore "Education in the New Republic," "The Confederate Constitution of 1861,""The Emancipation Proclamation of 1862-1863," and "The Constitution in the Twenty-firstCentury." [One hopes that a future printing can correct a minor error in the "Education" chapter. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were not the "last two surviving signers of the Declaration ofIndependence" (109) when they died on July 4, 1826. Maryland signer Charles Carroll ofCarrollton lived until 1832.] As published, the lectures seem to have been revised only slightly from their originaldelivery. Even the material added on the Twenty-seventh Amendment in Chapter 16 onlyrestates for the most part points made in Chapter 5 about the two proposed amendments,preceding the one now called the First Amendment, that were not ratified with the rest of thetwelve in 1791. While hardly conversational in tone, the books's prose is more akin to what onewrites to be spoken, not read. Moreover, like any series of well-crafted lectures, most ofAnastaplo's are replete with references to that which has already been said as well as to thatwhich lies ahead. The advantage of this style is that one needs neither to read the chapters insuccession nor even to read all of them to benefit from the volume; the disadvantage is that,when one does either, repetition seems far more abundant than was probably apparent to theaudiences that heard them. For example, the chapter on the First Amendment consumes twelvepages, yet discussion of the First Amendment in whole or in part occurs on an additional 24pages scattered from the first to the last of the lectures. Nonetheless, in contrast to lectures,endured by many, that were written to be read and not heard, Anastaplo's are more easilycomprehend ocularly than are the former aurally. Together, these lecture/chapters comprise slightly more than half of the 454 pages inthe volume prior to the index. About a third of the remainder consists of 13 sets of documents,letters, and other sources, ranging from Magna Carta (1215) and Thomas More's petition toHenry VIII on parliamentary freedom of speech (1521) to the Constitution of the ConfederateStates and the Emancipation Proclamation. The balance consists of extensive documentation insupport of the 17 chapters. To grasp both the essence and the significance of THE AMENDMENTS, it may behelpful to make clear what the book is not. In both content and perspective it is not at all likeIrving Brant's now venerable THE BILL OF RIGHTS (1965), which in the first half probes theorigins of constitutionally protected liberties through a series of case studies and in the secondtraces the Supreme Court's application of those liberties. Neither is Anastaplo's book similar toJohn R. Vile's CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN THE UNITED STATES (1994) or ACOMPANION TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTIONAL AND ITS AMENDMENTS(1993), which are case-oriented and emphasize amendment politics and process. Nor does thevolume pretend to be a substitute for references such as Jack W. Peltason's UNDERSTANDINGTHE CONSTITUTION (1994) which focuses in compressed fashion almost entirely on theprevailing interpretation of each provision in the Constitution. Rather, Anastaplo's is ajurisprudentially visionary discourse on American political thought as manifested in the 27amendments. Like Learned Hand's Holmes Lectures published as THE BILL OF RIGHTS(1958), the reader learns as much (or more) about the author's thinking as about the subjectpromised by the title. THE AMENDMENTS continues the author's efforts "to redeem the story of thisCountry in such a way as to contribute ... both to the edification of this generation of my fellowcitizens and to the education of the teachers of future generations" (xvi). That edification andeducation derive from a view of "the Constitution and its amendments [that] presuppose anestablished constitutional system. The amendments ratified from time to time have eitheracknowledged rights already recognized or adjusted arrangements in a way consistent with theoverall system" (229). A political system that guards basic rights and functions smoothly needsa citizenry with "moral judgment, including the sense of civility..." where emphasis [is] placedmore upon duties than upon rights (236-7, emphasis omitted). Accordingly, for Anastaplo theidea of rights must be properly understood. Herein lie several ironies. First, the Supreme Court has done both too much and too little with the FirstAmendment. Following Alexander Meiklejohn, Anastaplo believes that political speech is whatthe First Amendment, outside its religion clauses, was intended to shield. The sin of omissionstems from the Court's refusal not only to accept his free speech claim nearly 35 years ago butever to acknowledge in principle absolute protection for political speech. Practically speaking,the author would surely acknowledge that political speech now comes very close to absoluteprotection, although there is admittedly no certainty that Anastaplo would win, were his case tocome before the Court today. BAIRD v. STATE BAR OF ARIZONA (1971) argues strongly inhis favor (as Justice Blackmun's dissent in that case maintained), but LAW STUDENTSRESEARCH COUNCIL v. WADMOND, decided later in the same term, suggests that not allpolitical queries are improper. The Court's sins of commission consist of broadening "speech" toencompass "expression" (such as artistic works) which, Anastaplo holds, is not essential to"effective self-government" and "can, in some circumstances, undermine the character andeducation needed for sustained self-government" (53-4). Even were one to concede the pointthat the First Amendment is so limited, one still faces the formidable task, unaided by THEAMENDMENTS, of separating political from non-political speech. Second, although Hugo Black was Anastaplo's most energetic champion on theCourt and corresponded with him as late as 1969, the Justice and the author werejurisprudentially at odds on the nature of constitutional rights. Black, the legal positivist, lookedto the text of the Constitution as a source of rights. For Anastaplo, by contrast, these were rights"the people were already exercising ... by 1789. ... These were rights that were confirmed, notcreated, by the speech, press, assembly, and petition provisions of the First Amendment" (53). Such rights predated even the Declaration of Independence (30): the term "declaration" he finds"revealing" (15). Aside from rights recognized in common law, others derive from natural right. Precisely how one discerns the latter, however, THE AMENDMENTS leaves unexplained. The third irony is that, while Anastaplo is comfortable with an expansive reading ofconstitutionally recognized rights beyond those enumerated in the text, he remainsuncomfortable with the Court's expansion of judicially protected constitutional rights, such asthose the Court has found suggested by the Ninth and Fourteenth amendments. In other words,the mere existence of a fundamental right does not necessarily legitimize its judicialguardianship. Thus, one who argued against judicial timidity three and a half decades ago is byno means an advocate of a broad-based judicial activism. "[I]t is difficult to recognize a generalor comprehensive right to privacy without calling into question many of the seemingly legitimatepowers of government" (96). In this position he and Black would share some common ground,although for different reasons. Nonetheless, Anastaplo does not say that all unenumerated rightsare nonjusticiable; yet he offers only the vaguest guidelines for selecting those that are. The reader is left with the sense that most of those "other" rights are ones that thepeople choose to protect for themselves through the ordinary workings of the political process. "[M]uch has been done and continues to be done by statute" (234). Legislative action on thepeople's behalf is thus a manifestation of the implied right of revolution "retained" and"reserved" by the people, in the words of the Ninth and Tenth amendments, respectively.

Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. 297pp. Cloth$29.95. Reviewed by Ira L. Strauber, Department of Political Science, Grinnell College. This is a cultivated and remarkably subtle defense of an ambitious, evenstunning thesis: Justice Sutherland's jurisprudence ought to be understood,by liberals and conservatives alike, as the foundation of contemporary substantiverights jurisprudence, be it about property or civil rights. Professor Arkes's thesis builds out from the claim that Sutherland's jurisprudenceis a victim of bad constitutional history, constitutional commentary, andpolitics -- all of which have caused Arkes's Sutherland to be misunderstood,and thus wrongly disdained or ignored by those on the left and on the right.To correct for this failure Arkes positions his Sutherland not only as theparadigm of the natural law jurist of substantive rights, but also, andeven more audaciously, as the jurist all depend upon yet fail to recognizeas their own (37). In short, Arkes uses Sutherland to suggest that naturallaw is deeply embedded in the political culture and the Constitution, andhow it is that Sutherland is the single best source of a "coherentmoral account" of natural law for future renditions of constitutionalrights and powers. The basic political theory that governs Sutherland's jurisprudence and Arkes'streatment of it is that the Constitution has its "proper moral ground"in a universalistic conception of human nature that treats persons as "moralagents, with the capacity to give and understand reasons over matters ofright and wrong"(9). (This much will be familiar to readers of BEYONDTHE CONSTITUTION, 1990). Consequently, the primary moral imperative of acoherent jurisprudence is to follow a "purely jural" (79) paththat distinguishes non-contingent rights from wrongs. (If I may be permitted an aside: readers, even skeptical ones, of textslike Segal and Spaeth's THE SUPREME COURT AND THE ATTITUDINAL MODEL maybe detained by the expression"purely jural" as a descriptor oflegal reasoning, but they should persist.) Arkes's arguments for the superiority of this "purely jural" pathof the law are designed: 1) to redress the mistaken readings of history,commentary, and politics that have reduced Sutherland's opinions to a meredefense of property or laissez-faire economics (73); 2) to explain how andwhy Sutherland's opinions exemplify "an understanding of a good thatis truly categorical and necessary" by their adjudication of "thedifference between propositions that are merely contingent and problematicand propositions that have the force of logical necessity" (79-80,249); and 3) to demonstrate why Sutherland's logic of natural rights ismore internally consistent and coherent than the sociological jurisprudence,legal realism, and positivism of the likes of Brandies, Cardozo, Hughes,and Black. (To those ends the text is interspersed with informative analogiesbetween Sutherland's and contemporary jurisprudence in regard to the thingslike the Page 99 follows: takings of property, independent counsel, foreign policy issues, abortion,and free speech.) Regarding the first point, it is widely acknowledged that Sutherland's constitutionalopinions evidence a staunch defense of civil liberties as well as propertyrights, and that they consistently seek (moral) criteria that bind rightsand liberties with legitimate (reasonable) police power restraints. In regardto property rights, Arkes uses ADKINS V. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (1923) andthe lesser read NEW STATE ICE CO. V. LIEBMANN (1932) for fleshing out theconsistency and coherence of Sutherland's natural law philosophy about personhoodand immutable principles of justice. That Sutherland's objections to NewDeal legislation ought to be read as having their foundation in jural distinctionsand not mere political and economic partisanship may not be persuasive toeveryone, but all should appreciate the way Arkes reasons his way throughhis materials to make his point. At the very least, this rendition of Sutherland's jurisprudence ably demonstratesSutherland's craftsmanship, specifically in regard to the coherence of hisinterpretations of the Constitution based on the architectonic principle"that people retain a certain freedom to choose their own course, andit is only on the basis of that essential freedom that we may be justifiedin holding people responsible for their acts" (74). Perhaps the mostimportant and interesting move that Arkes makes at this level is the intimatenexus he constructs between this principle, as a categorical natural lawgood, and a reading of the Commerce clause. Using CARTER COAL (1936) as the focal point, Arkes explains how Sutherland'sopinions in Commerce clause cases, and on issues of the delegation of authority(which Arkes believes is not a dead letter), arise out of a profound concernwith the moral and jural consequences of the diminution of the rule of lawand the principle of limited government embedded in the Constitution. Theaspect of this explanation that captured my attention is the issue of "grandjural significance" (129) that Arkes locates in these cases. As I understandit, we are to see Sutherland as having appreciated (in a somewhat under-developedway) that the Commerce clause, as a formula for the extent and limits ofFederal power (and therefore the Constitution as a text), ought to be readin terms of common/natural law distinctions. These distinctions have theirorigin in jural principles of personal freedom and relations between persons(concerning both property and civil liberties) and in morally legitimateSTATE police power restraints. Thus, concerns about persons and STATE powermust structure, and not merely be the result of, interpretations of theCommerce clause. For example, the nature and extent of the regulatory powerof Congress ought to be understood in terms of a delegation of originalState authority over local commerce, constrained by natural/common law andthe laws of the States, and extended to Congress to construct a national"political economy" of private ownership (123, 131) subject tothe self-same constraints. I, for one, found it hard to avoid the implication of this view, so remarkablyset out via references to the jurisprudence of John Marshall and the child-laborlaw case, Page 100 follows: HAMMER V. DAGENHART (1918), that the dominant legal realistic or positivisticeconomic or policy considerations that are used today to set the extentand limits of Congressional power actually ''mute" or "conceal"(132) the putatively requisite "rigorously moral arguments" aboutthe propriety of transactions between states that the Commerce clause requires.And, if this benighted legal realist is any indication, many more readersthan the author expects will also find a Sutherland who has a coherent andconsistent position when it comes to the Commerce clause and limits on Federalpower. Perhaps I found Arkes's Sutherland persuasive in part because Arkes acknowledgesthat the paradigmatic moral judgments he endorses, and Sutherland articulates,are not formulaic ones. In a number of different, and carefully scriptedways, Arkes makes clear the logical necessity and the virtues of prudentialconsiderations, along with judicial restraint, as important, albeit supplementary,elements in the matrix of natural-law axioms that go into constitutionalinterpretation (157,194,230). This is as good a point as any to interjectthat it would be a mistake for readers to stay away from this book becausethey already think they know what to make of Sutherland and/or Arkes onnatural law and judicial restraint. Moreover, if readers suspend their ownpredilections, and read this book on its own terms, they will find thatit indeed compels a reader to raise stubborn questions about exactly how,if not whether, to rejoinder those assertions. Apropos of that last remark, Arkes himself is alive to a problem with Sutherland'snatural-law jurisprudence. After all, how to square Sutherland, the guardianof limits on legislative authority, and the author of HUMPHREY'S EXECUTOR(1935, limiting Presidential removal power over executive appointments),with the Sutherland who is the author of CURTIS-WRIGHT EXPORTING CORPORATION(1936, legitimizing delegated authority to the President to prohibit shipmentsof arms to countries at war in the Chaco region of South America) and whovests in the President foreign policy powers extending well beyond the Constitutionand specific legislative enactments? The answer Arkes gives to this question is worthy of special praise. Hehas to fill in some gaps in Sutherland's explicit statements, and to doso he weaves together an intricate analysis, noteworthy for its lucidityand depth. This analysis includes Chief Justice Taft's decision in the MYERSCase (1926, legitimizing enormous removal power to the President), the opinionsof Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia in the independent counselcase of MORRISON V. OLSON (1988), and a set of related cases and incidentsrelated to foreign policy and diplomatic issues (along with HUMPHREY'S EXECUTORand CURTIS-WRIGHT). The results of this analysis is the conclusion thatthe "purely jural" path of the law sometimes goes beyond the Constitution,lawful delegation of authority, and moral propositions (about takings ofprivate property in particular). The constraints of space lead me to caricature Arkes's justification forthis Page 101 follows: conclusion as follows. Natural law propositions are universalistic ones,but sometimes prudence requires, as in the case of the exigencies of foreignpolicy, recognition of the fact that interpreting the Constitution mustbe "governed by interests and rules outside the Constitution"(224). Such exigencies require an exercise of (Lockean) executive prerogativethat may not always satisfy the general principles of lawful propositions,yet jural legitimization of prerogative may be essential, and unavoidable,to preserve the polity, the greater good, and the character of constitutionalgovernment. This answer does not get Sutherland altogether off the hook for his failureto apply the same rigorous moral reasoning in executive politics that hedid in legislative politics. Arkes argues that Sutherland should, and could,have done a better job with the CURTISS-WRIGHT opinion. Nevertheless, Arkesassures us, Sutherland has made a "mistake of refined reasoning"but no "GRAND mistakes" (235, author's italics). That is, thelocus of Sutherland's deserved reputation ought to be where he brought naturallaw and textual principles together, and even if CURTISS-WRIGHT did notfully justify those principles they are sufficiently honored, in a broadsense, by an appropriately justified conception of judicial restraint. Whether the specifics of this defense of Sutherland are persuasive or notI leave to readers. What I want to address is one implication of Arkes'sdefense for the more basic issue of the internal consistency and coherenceof jurisprudential arguments. As I understand it, Arkes wants us to be persuadedby Sutherland's natural-law jurisprudence on the New Deal and foreign policybecause, at bottom, it teaches the lesson of his BEYOND THE CONSTITUTION-- the good of the textual Constitution is not always the same as the publicgood that lies outside it. Building on Locke's defense of executive prerogative,Arkes emphasizes that prudence that goes beyond the reach of the imperativesof law is legitimate only if it has "a design that is immediately intelligible...,and... well within bounds of equity that [are] readily grasped by the public"because it is rooted in an understanding of a good that is real, natural,and anchored in the world" (240-241). Arkes says that this defense does not imply either historicism or relativism;no, this jurisprudence is constrained by natural law categorical imperativesand the logical properties of the Constitution. In my own words, Locke guidesus by explaining how going beyond a specific rule is fully justified whenfollowing a rule undermines some greater good that the rules in generalare meant to defend. If I have not mis-stated here, I think that there arealternative readings of Locke that put this explanation on a slippery slope,and therefore, at least potentially, undermine confidence in the axiomaticcharacter of natural law principles and the political economy they are supposedto preserve. But I can mention this only in passing because I want to saythat there is a profoundly more important lesson in this explanation, quiteindependent (if the author will forgive me) of the advocacy of natural-lawand judicial restraint. I do not mean here to ignore the strengths of Arkes' natural-law lessonsper se; Page 102 follows: rather I go beyond his text, and the substance of his positions, to bringto the forefront a more general lesson I see taught about how a prudentjurisprudence requires some meld of principles and contingent or consequentialistconsiderations. THE RETURN OF GEORGE SUTHERLAND teaches that for this meldto be jurisprudential it must follow the path of explicit principles oflegal reasoning and not substitute the willy-nilly rationalizations of aresults orientation or abstractions detached from " a life governedby moral understanding [that] finds its expression in goods that have areal embodiment, or a noticeable presence, in our lives" (12). In the concluding pages, Arkes leans on Cicero's rhetoric to emphasize thatin the attempt to be jurisprudential "there are layers, then, beyondlayers: [there is] skepticism about rules unvarying from case to case; butbeyond that skepticism [is] an awareness of hierarchies of goods, whichmay nevertheless guide the hand of prudence" (291). By saying this,Arkes presents Sutherland as teaching the lesson that the craft of jurisprudence,and commentary I will add, must take seriously the "intractable tensionbetween categorical imperatives and the claims of prudence" (290).If I have not done an injustice to the book in drawing this lesson fromit then I would amend Arkes's claim that Sutherland has something to teachthose on both the right and the left. An equally important message is thatArkes -- in defense of, and sometimes arguing with Sutherland -- teacheslessons from which we can all learn. References: ADKINS V.

Baer. New York: Holmes & Meier, 1991. 350 pp.Cloth $45.00. Paper $24.95. Reviewed by Susan M. Olson, Department of Political Science, Universityof Utah Judith Baer intends her book to serve the dual purpose of an undergraduatetextbook and a book for general audiences on women and the law. I believeshe has been enormously successful. The book covers a vast range of subjectsand makes complex legal doctrines accessible in a style that is lively andoften humor- ous. Her principal theme is the contradiction between the formal legal equalityof men and women, now largely achieved in American law, and the persistentreality of inequality because of women's greater responsibility for thedomestic sphere -- housework, child care, tending elderly parents, and soforth. She notes the irony that in the last century (and mainly in the lasttwenty years) formal American law has changed from being more harshly patriarchalthan many women's day-to-day experience actually was to being much moreegalitarian than most women now experience. When married women had no legalidentity separate from their husbands, many women nonetheless enjoyed caringand secure relationships. Now when most laws are gender-neutral and menand women formally equal, poverty has become "feminized," womenwork a "double shift" of paid and unpaid labor, and rape remainscommonplace. An ultraconservative could, I suppose, draw from this evidence the conclusionthat women were better off before or even that formal legal equality somehowcaused women's situation to deteriorate. (Teachers of undergraduate classes,beware.) Baer, in contrast, uses this situation to discuss the complex relation-ship between law and society. She emphasizes the many gains women have madefrom legal reforms, but notes that there are limits to what one can expectfrom law, at least within the American tradition. She stresses that lawis not all-powerful, but also not powerless. Ultimately, she is optimisticthat continuing to use law to equalize women's economic power will graduallyimprove their ability to achieve a more equal distribu- tion of burdensin the private sphere. A secondary theme of the book is the relation of patriarchy to race andclass oppression. She makes clear in the introduc- tion that patriarchyis only one of several possible asymmetrical relations, and that some womenare more oppressed than others. She repeatedly returns to class differenceswhen discussing issues such as employment and reproductive rights and occasional-ly returns to race, as in her discussion of rape. At the same time she putsforth a rousing rebuttal of the stereotype of the selfish, affluent, feministprofessional (p. 160) and devotes a sizable segment to analyzing "feministbashing" (pp. 286-91). Page 39 follows: Because it includes not only federal constitutional and statutory law butalso topics that are still entirely matters of state law, the book is probablythe most comprehensive new non- case law book available on women and law.The book's subtitle and Baer's comments in the introduction make clear thebook's focus on the contemporary legal status of women, but they almostsuggest the book is more limited than it is. Where appropriate, Baer summarizesthe earlier legal status of women with respect to issues such as familyviolence, birth control, and participation in the public arena. On the otherhand, beyond her general discussion in the first two chapters of the changingrole of the federal government in shaping social policy at the time of theNew Deal, that admittedly arbitrary starting point does not play much rolein the book. The organization of the book is by topic: women and the constitution (levelsof scrutiny, overt and facially neutral discrimination, and the Equal RightsAmendment); employment (equal pay and comparable worth, Title VII, and affirmativeaction); the private sphere (divorce, custody, widowhood); reproduction(birth control, sterilization, surrogate motherhood, and abortion); educationand participation (discriminatory private associations); and women in thelegal system (rape, family violence, pornography, women criminals, and womenlawyers and judges). Baer is at her very best on the constitutional topics. She not only explainsthe Supreme Court's evolution of different levels of scrutiny in understandableterms, but also pauses to provide more detailed critiques of the requirementof proving intentional discrimination and of the reasoning of GRISWOLD V.CONNECTICUT and ROE V. WADE. She uses the somewhat less familiar cases onrights of unwed fathers to illuminate both the benefits that men have gainedat least as much as women from greater scrutiny of gender classificationsand the Court's apparent preference for stereotypical sex roles. Baer does not shy from controversy. She is forthright in stating her ownopinions and in giving clear and candid accounts of conflicts among feminists,as in the SEARS and CALIFORNIA FEDERAL cases. One of the most appealingfeatures of the book is Baer's dry wit. For example, in noting that thelast constitu- tional sex discrimination case in which the successful plaintiffwas a woman occurred in 1981, she quotes Nora Ephron's comment that "themajor concrete achievement of the women's movement in the 1970's was theDutch treat." Baer examines Ephron's metaphor and finally concludesthat it is not such a bad description of equal protection doctrine afterall: "[L]et us remember, women's privileges, like being their dates'dinner guests, often did carry the unstated presumption that they imposedvarious social burdens which might euphemistically be termed reciprocalobliga- tions. A woman who pays for her own meal is free of such bur- dens"(p. 52). The shortcomings of the book are few and minor. Occasional specific pointscould use elaboration or clarification to avoid readers' possible confusion.For example, Baer jumps directly from talking about labor union oppositionto the Equal Rights Amendment to discussing women's reduced need for protective Page 40 follows: legislation because of the benefits of unionization (p. 54). An additionalparagraph about women and labor unions might make those two seem less inconsistent.Similarly, she cites the now- familiar figures about men's standard of livingimproving after divorce while women and children's decline (p. 136) andthen two pages later attributes some men's post-divorce behavior to a senseof relative deprivation. These two may be compatible, but a little morediscussion is needed to make that clear. Although the authors and her editors undoubtedly agonized over what to leaveout to keep the book to a manageable length, I feel that the chapter onWomen in the Legal System gives the least adequate treatment of the manysubjects it includes. The discussion of pornography in particular is justover two pages in length and would need to be supplemented with other readingsfor a full class discussion of the issue. Although Catherine MacKin- non'sand Donald Downs's books are cited in the footnotes at the back of the book,no book on pornography is included in the sources suggested prominentlyat the end of the chapter--a helpful feature at the end of each chapterin the book. Baer's emphatic opinions will provide grist for lively arguments. Some maybe offended by her largely unsympathetic reaction to noncustodial fathers(p. 145). Her analogy between opponents of public funding of abortion and1960s peace activists' tax protests to make the point that "citizenshave never been allowed to refuse to pay for activities of which they disapprove"(p. 201) ignores the difference that the former taxpayers have been ableto gain the legislative majority to write their preferences into law. Although I completely agree that unequal distribution of housework and childcare responsibilities is the single biggest barrier to women's equality,I would have liked Baer to include a description of family life in one ofthose admittedly rare families where an equal distribution actually occurs.To resort to feminist utopian fiction for a portrait of sexual equality,as Baer does, makes the prospect of men assuming more domestic responsibilitiesseem nearly hopeless when, in fact, a few men are doing it now and, if notthriving, at least surviving. Baer's stated hope for the book is that readers will allow their disagreementswith her opinions to stimulate further thought and research (p. Xiii). Ithink the book will accomplish this, which is a great testimony to its clarity,thoroughness and provocative humor.

Baird, Robert H. Gertner and RandalC. Picker. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. 330 pp. Cloth $45.00. Reviewed by Jack Knight, Department of Political Science, Washington Universityin St. Louis GAME THEORY AND THE LAW is an important book. It is important in the sensethat it will serve as a catalyst for an expanded use of game-theoretic modelsin the study of law. It will be a book that people will one day recognizeas having had a considerable influence on its field. And it will receivethe praise that accompanies such influence. Happily, such influence willbe beneficial to the field of law and such praise will be richly deserved,because GAME THEORY AND THE LAW is an extremely intelligent and thoughtfultext. I recommend it without reservation to students of law and politics(and to those of law and economics, for that matter) and, more generally,to students of game theory and strategic behavior. Baird, Gertner and Pickerset two goals for themselves in writing this book: (1) "to introducethe formal tools of modern game theory to a wide audience using a numberof classical problems ranging from tort and contract law to labor law, environmentalregulations, and antitrust" and (2) "to show how modern game theoryallows us to sharpen our intuitions and provides us with new ways of lookingat familiar problems." (p. xi) The authors achieve both of these goalsand more in a very impressive fashion. Their sophisticated grasp of theintricacies of game theory as well as of the strategic dimensions of manyareas of the law is manifest throughout the volume. Their analysis is analyticallyrigorous, but not mathematically complex. For those readers who are waryof mathematics for one reason or another, I can assure you that the authorsare able to translate sophisticated and complex mathematical concepts intofairly simple ones without failing to communicate the underlying point ofthe concept. More importantly, one of the features of the book that is most striking(and, for my part, most welcome) is the thoughtful and sensible manner inwhich they approach the use of game theory. Unlike many proponents of game-theoreticanalysis, they do not present it as the only legitimate approach to social-scientificanalysis. The authors present game theory as a powerful tool that can beused along with other approaches to enhance our understanding of the roleof law in social life. They straightforwardly acknowledge what many taketo be a criticism of game theory -- that game-theoretic models simplifythe reality of social interactions -- but they assert quite rightly thatsuch simplification is not a problem as long as we remain clear about whywe are using the model: to compare the possible effects of different legalrules on those interactions. They suggest that "[t]he test of a modelis whether it can hone our intuition by illuminating the basic forces thatare at work but not plainly visible when we look at an actual case in allits detail." (p. 7) They also offer a reasonable response to anotheroft-cited criticism of game-theoretic analysis -- the assumption of maximizingself-interested behavior in writing: The basic assumption at the heart of this mode of analysis is not that individualsare self-interested Page 180 follows: profit-maximizers or care only about money, but rather that they act ina way that is sensible for them given their own tastes and predilections.This assumption may not always hold in an individual case, because peopleat times act in ways that are inconsistent and self-destructive. In general,however, people make the best decisions they can, given their beliefs aboutwhat others will do. (p. 11) They offer solid cautionary advice (especially in an extended discussionin chapter six) about the care necessary to avoid using the wrong modelsto analyze subtle social situations. (How many of us have wondered whetherthe world really is one big Prisoner's Dilemma game?) Finally, throughouttheir analysis they maintain a realistic view of the assumptions about theworld to which we commit ourselves when we employ game-theoretic solutionconcepts, assumptions that may lead us to draw false inferences about theeffects of legal rules on strategic behavior. In discussing the move froma less restrictive to a more restrictive solution concept, the authors notethat "we must assume more about what individuals know and more abouthow they believe others will act. The more we have to make such assumptions,the less certain we can be that our model will accurately predict the wayindividuals behave." (p. 13) Having set forth their understanding of the strengths and weaknesses ofgame-theoretic analysis in their early discussion, Baird, Gertner and Pickerproceed in the course of the book to make a powerful case for the valueof the approach. To give an adequate sense of the sheer breadth of theircoverage, I will merely outline the issues -- both game-theoretic and legal-- that they address in their eight chapters. In the first chapter theypresent the basic assumptions of strategic behavior and introduce staticgames and their basic solution concepts (including Nash); they discuss tortlaws governing negligence and the duty of due care. In the second chapterthey incorporate time into the analysis and begin a consideration of extensiveform games (including an exceptionally clear and informative explicationof the subgame perfect solution concept); they demonstrate the relevanceof models of ongoing interactions in the areas of antitrust law and debtor-creditorrelations. In chapters three and four they introduce the complexity of incompleteinformation, the realistic assumption that there is important informationrelevant to the social interaction that is unknown to either one or bothof the actors. The authors call incomplete information "the centralproblem in game theory and the law." (p. 2) From a strategic perspectivethey develop the issues of unraveling, signaling, screening, the crucialrole of beliefs in games of incomplete information and the basic incompleteinformation solution concept, perfect Bayesian equilibrium, and some ofits refinements; from a legal perspective the authors show how incompleteinformation influences the effect of legal rules in such areas as plantclosing laws, parental leave provisions, disclosure laws, inquiry limits(including a provocative discussion of the Page 181 follows: Americans with Disabilities Act) and various laws that govern contractsthat envision future renegotiations. In chapters five and six they considera set of issues related to problems of collective action and cooperativebehavior. The game theoretic issues included in these chapters include repeatedgames, the problem of multiple equilibria, the folk theorem, the effectof reputation and mechanism design; the legal issues include the Statuteof Frauds and antitrust regulations governing predatory pricing and tacitcollusion. In the last two chapters the authors introduce distributionalconsiderations including an explication of non-cooperative bargaining theory(both the classic Rubenstein model and various models which incorporateassumptions of incomplete information); then they demonstrate the valueof these models for understanding bankruptcy law (including the provisionsgoverning automatic stays and the new value exception), labor law (restrictionson hiring permanent replacement workers) and rules of civil procedure (includingprovisions covering pre-trial discovery procedures and rules dictating thestructure of hearings and trials.) But even more than through their comprehensiveness, the authors' case forthe value of game theory is made through the creativity of their analysis.To highlight this creativity, I will briefly discuss two examples of thesignificant insights which they offer. First, as I have previously stated,the problems related to information are, in the minds of the authors, fundamentalto law. They emphasize the importance of the distinction between verifiableand nonverifiable information. Through their analysis of social interactionsthat are characterized by these different types of information, they demonstrateone of the major insights of their analysis: legal rules intended to affectthe communication of private information (that is, information known toonly some of the actors involved in an interaction) will have differenteffects depending on whether or not the information is verifiable (by eitherthe other actors or a court.) An especially striking feature of this insightis captured in their claim "[t]o understand the effects of a legalrule, we must pay attention to the way it affects not only actions thatthe parties actually take, but also actions that they would not have takeneven in the absence of a legal rule." (p. 156) Here the value of theuse of game theory is most telling because this particular insight is explicitlyderived from the implications of the game-theoretic concept of off-the -equilibrium path beliefs (basically, the idea that people are often affectedin how they will act by their expectations of what those with whom theyinteract will do if they themselves were to act differently.) Through aset of legal examples analyzed by a simple model of incomplete information,the authors show that the law can influence behavior by establishing rulesthat prohibit behavior that the actors would not do even if the rule wasnot in place. For example, in a situation in which employers are known todiscriminate against disabled job applicants, the authors find that theequilibrium outcome is that disabled applicants misrepresent their disabilitiesand thus employers treat all applicants similarly. When the authors introducea rule that prohibits discrimination based on disability, the equilibriumoutcome changes to one in which the disabled workers reveal their disabilitiesand the employer adopts a work plan that differs for disabled and nondisabledworkers and which produces a superior Page 182 follows: outcome for both workers and the employer. Thus, a rule that prohibits anaction that the employer would not even take if the actors were being strategicallyrational nonetheless produces a change in behavior that is socially optimal. Second, the authors show how game-theoretic analysis can provide insightsinto how we might make mistakes in our analysis of the effects of legalrules. Their analysis shows that studies of the effects of discovery ruleson civil litigation will misconstrue those effects if they focus merelyon the cases that go to trial. The authors demonstrate a selection biasin such a study sample. By analyzing the strategic effects of discoveryrules on pre-trial negotiations, the authors show that some discovery ruleshave the effect of causing those parties who are most likely to be liableto settle their cases before trial, thus selecting out those cases mostlikely to result in a judgment for the plaintiff. Because of this pre-trialeffect, the cases that do actually go to trial are disproportionately thosemost likely to lead to a judgment for defendants (because people who knowthat they are not liable are the ones least likely to accept a settlementoffer.) If analysts were to base their investigation of rules of civil proceduremerely on the cases that go to trial and judgment, they would, on the authors'analysis, fail to capture important effects of these rules. This selectionbias is clarified by the use of a simple game-theoretic model of litigation. These are merely two examples from a wealth of insights offered by Baird,Gertner and Picker. The persuasiveness of their general argument for theutility of game theory derives from a combination of the power of theirinsights along with the sensibility of their analysis. The book is writtenin a clear, concise and interesting manner. Its bibliographic referencesrender it a source book for additional research in both game theory andlaw. This is a book that should be read by scholars of law in particularand scholars of political behavior in general. One of the best complimentsthat I can give it is that it would also be a profitable investment forthose who focus primarily on formal models of strategic behavior and games.

Baker. University Press of Kansas, 1992. 148 pp. Reviewed by James Eisenstein, Department of Political Science, PennsylvaniaState University. As its subtitle suggests, CONFLICTING LOYALTIES examines how U.S. attorneysgeneral respond to the inherent conflict that arises from competing pressuresfrom the spheres of law and politics. The author has two purposes. The first, stated on page 1, argues that examiningthe tensions these pressures produce "may enable us to clarify ourexpectations of the office and reject those that are unrealistic or problematic."The second, largely implicit, seeks to go beyond clarification of expectationsto increase our understanding of the factors that shape how attorneys generalbehave. The most explicit statement of this second purpose follows the introductionto the book's principal conceptual distinction: the "Advocate"and the "Neutral" styles of behavior in office. It reads (35),"Most of this book will test the validity of these two ideal typesagainst the actual experiences of several attorneys general." The book "draws on an empirical examination of almost forty attorneysgeneral [among the seventy-five who have served]." (36) It relies primarilyon published sources, though Professor Baker also examined archival materialin four presidential libraries and conducted a handful of interviews withseveral former attorneys general and other Department of Justice officials. The book succeeds in achieving the first purpose. Throughout, ProfessorBaker recounts a number of fascinating stories of the important roles anumber of attorneys general have played as legal and political decision-makersand occasionally as the architects of scandal. Most students of the federallegal process will be familiar with descriptions of the troubled tenureof A. Mitchell Palmer, Harry Daugherty, and John Mitchell, and the moreuplifting tenure of Harlen Fiske Stone and Edward Levi. Fewer will knowmuch about Caleb Cushing, who played a central role both in securing FranklinPierce's nomination and in shaping his administration's policies. The discussionof the relationship between Griffin Bell and President Carter and his otheradvisors provides an especially rich and interesting glimpse into the dynamicsof attorney general's behavior. There are no surprises in the final chapter's discussion of the complexmix of advantages and disadvantages flowing from both the "Advocate"and "Neutral" styles. Professor Baker argues that even a Neutralwho avoids overtly political decisions nonetheless makes political choicesin fulfilling the office's responsibilities. She concludes that "underordinary circumstances" the Advocate style better meets the conflictingdemands of the office. The discussion provides a useful and sound overviewof the office's place in the American political system. The synopsis ofcompeting views of the appropriate relationship between the president andthe attorney general in chapter one and the summary of the development ofthe office in chapter two are also worthwhile. There are some surprising omissions in Professor Baker's coverage that limitthe book's success in clarifying our expectations of the office. It largelyignores existing literature on federal judicial administration, United Statesattorneys, the solicitor general, and the anti-trust division, among others.Its treatment of special prosecutors and the problems posed when the decisionsof an attorney general affect the partisan fortunes of his president, hisparty, or the opposing party is far less extensive than it should be. RamseyClark's tenure receives little attention. Most serious is the failure toexplore fully Elliot Richardson's decision to resign rather than accedeto President Nixon's order that special prosecutor Archibald Cox be fired.This act, and the sequence of events triggered by the "Saturday NightMassacre," played a pivotal role in recent American political history.It offers an unsurpassed opportunity to explore Page 108 follows: how an attorney general's loyalties can be in conflict, and how the resolutionof the conflict matters. The book largely fails to achieve the second purpose. Readers seeking awell-grounded, conceptually sound approach to enhance their understandingof how the office of attorney general fits into the political and legalsystems will find this book disappointing. Professor Baker possesses a goodinstinctive understanding of a variety of factors that shape how attorneysgeneral behave. But nowhere does she present in a systematic way the variablesthat shape the office and its occupants; nor does she discuss how thesevariables interact. A partial list of the factors mentioned at various timessuggests the value of such systematic inquiry. They include: the natureof the president's personality and management style, the politics surroundingthe appointment of the attorney general, the general political environment(for example, whether scandal recently touched the Department of Justiceor attorney general; whether the president's party controls congress); theattorney general's concept of the law and his role; the strength of competingsources of both legal and political advice in a president's administration. Problems also arise in the use of the "Advocate -- Neutral" typology.Professor Baker acknowledges that it is "rudimentary," but itis more rudimentary than it needs to be. The most detailed presentationof the typology appears in two brief paragraphs in Chapter One. The bookcontains the raw material necessary to construct a well grounded portraitof the strategic environment of the attorney general. It could then examinehow the personal characteristics of individual attorneys general interactwith the strategic environment to produce different styles. Some versionof the "Advocate -- Neutral" distinction would probably result.But it would be more powerful and useful if it were constructed from a richerset of variables. For example, one could distinguish between an active andneutral style in two spheres of activity -- as head of the Department ofJustice and chief legal officer, and as a policy advisor and participantin forming broad domestic and foreign policy. The resulting four-fold classificationwould provide a start in providing a more sophisticated and useful scheme. As the distinction is used, it is not clear whether Professor Baker systematicallyapplied a set of established defining criteria to categorize the attorneysgeneral she studied as "Advocates" or "Neutrals." Asummary table listing these criteria and how they are operationalized, andanother placing the forty individuals studied along the "Advocate --Neutral" continuum would have clarified the conceptual scheme and eliminatedsome of the confusion I repeated encountered. One example conveys the natureof this pervasive confusion. Benjamin Brewster, discussed at length in thechapter on the Neutral attorney general, "became one of Arthur's trustedadvisors in political as well as legal affairs." (135) The text continues,"This broad advisory role seems to conflict with the Neutral type,except that Arthur himself acted in such a surprisingly nonpartisan waywhile in office." Here, the degree of a president's partisanship apparentlycontrols the decision to classify an individual along the book's centralconceptual dimension, forcing someone whose behavior would qualify him asan "advocate" in a different president's administration into the"neutral" camp. If CONFLICTING LOYALTIES fails to advance our understanding of the roleattorneys general play in American law and politics as much as it mighthave, it does take a step forward in doing so. It demonstrates well thatmuch interesting and important work remains to be done. The book providesa useful starting place for Professor Baker and others interested in thefederal legal process to advance our systematic knowledge of the role theoffice plays.

DOUGLAS, AND AMERICA'S CONSTITUTIONALREVOLUTION by Howard Ball and Phillip J. Cooper. New York: Oxford UniversityPress, 1992. 390 pp. Cloth $29.95 Reviewed by John E. Finn, Department of Government, Wesleyan University. OF POWER AND RIGHT is a "dual biography" of Justices Hugo Blackand William O. Douglas. One might wonder whether such a book is necessary.After all, we hardly lack material on Black. In addition to Black's ownworks, we possess studies by Tinsley Yarbrough (1988), Mark Silverstein(1984), James Magee (1980), and Gerald Dunne (1977). The literature on Douglasis no less voluminous. Douglas wrote three autobiographies, and there are,among others, fine studies by James Simon (1980) and Vern Coun- tryman (1974).Nor do we lack histories of the Courts on which they served. So why read OF POWER AND RIGHT? Ball and Cooper tell us how two markedlydifferent men came to "share a partnership and a contest." Inrecounting the story, they promise us a unique perspective on the SupremeCourt as an institution. OF POWER AND RIGHT also promises us an educationin the fundamental conflict of American constitutional life, the tensionbetween a democratic conception of political power and the protection ofindividual liberty. In many ways, OF POWER AND RIGHT is a success. Its discus- sion of the relationshipbetween Black and Douglas is discerning. Ball and Cooper capture the essentialdifferences between the two men, differences that traced their origins,as Ball and Cooper so vividly demonstrate, to their personal and professionallives before they were appointed to the Court. The authors deserve specialpraise for their decision to include a chapter on the New Deal backgroundsof Black and Douglas, in which they detail Hugo- to-Hell Black's stormycareer in the Senate and Douglas's contro- versial years at the Securitiesand Exchange Commission. Their political backgrounds, the authors argue,contributed to Black and Douglas's harsh criticism of the Court before Rooseveltput their names in nomination. The book also realizes its attempt to tell us something of the Court asinstitution. Drawing extensively on the private papers of several justices,Ball and Cooper chronicle the inter- nal dynamics of the post-New Deal Courtas it struggled to find its place in America's constitutional revolution.Ball and Cooper picture a Court sensitive to law, politics, and sometimespersonality. Their treatment of the very public dispute between JusticesBlack and Jackson, for example, is measured and fair, as is their discussionof the antagonism between Justices Douglas and Frankfurter. The book isespecially moving when it chroni- cles Black's departure from the Courtand Douglas's reaction to the loss of his colleague and friend. Page 73 follows: Unfortunately, the book is less successful in its other purpose: to tellus something about the constitutional tension between democratic power andindividual right. Scattered summa- ries of Black's and Douglas's constitutionalphilosophies appear throughout the book; they feature most prominently inthe chap- ters that address specific areas of constitutional law. In general,however, these treatments are far too brief and mislead- ingly simple. Theproblem is partly reflected in Ball and Cooper's decision to associate Blackwith power, and Douglas with right. Unadorned, constitutional positivism is, as Ball and Cooper suggest, a theoryof the constitutional order that emphasizes the power of the people to govern.Similarly, a commitment to the priority of individual liberty, is, in itssimplest forms, a theory of the constitutional order that emphasizes notpower but right. As held by Black and Douglas, however, these philosophiesare profoundly complex. Theories of constitutional interpreta- tion premisedupon power or right, for example, necessarily imply somewhat different attitudestoward the proper use of judicial power and somewhat different approachesto constitutional inter- pretation. Throughout much of their career together, Black and Douglas could work togetherdespite differences in their understanding of constitutional government,for only occasionally did they lead to disparate decisions. In the lastdecade of their time together, however, the Court began to address issues,notably concerning privacy and equality, in which implicit differences becamemanifest. Black and Douglas increasingly found themselves on separate sidesin important cases, such as Griswold v. Connecti- cut (1965). Ball and Cooper tell us about the parting and that it sprang, ultimately,from differences in constitutional philoso- phy. But because their discussionsof constitutional philosophy largely proceed piecemeal, only readers alreadyfamiliar with the intricacies of constitutional interpretation are likelyto appreciate fully how theories of power and right figured both in contestsover constitutional interpretation and over the proper extent of federaljudicial power. The complexities of their constitutional theories, then,no less than Black and Douglas's political experiences in the Senate andthe SEC, warrant a separate chapter early in the book. Notwithstanding this omission, OF POWER AND RIGHT is an impressive studyof a friendship that endured three decades and conquered formidable differencesin style, temperament, and, finally, constitutional philosophy. Comprehensive,engaging, and sometimes moving, this is a book all students of the Courtshould read. References: Countryman, Vern. THE JUDICIAL RECORD OF JUSTICE WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS.

Barber. The Johns HopkinsPress, 1993. 279pp. Cloth $25.95 Reviewed by Ira L. Strauber, Department of Political Science, Grinnell College Prof. Barber has written one of the most intellectually serious, stimulating,and ingenious jurisprudential arguments I have read in quite some time.I say that as someone who does not share Barber's central premise that philosophyis essential to constitutional interpretation, and as one who doubts thatphilosophy necessarily leads teachers and critics to worry about the rightthings in constitutional law and politics. Yet, as unconvinced as I am ofmuch of what he has to say, I am equally convinced that readers will begenerally impressed with how Barber says it. Indeed, I expect to returnto this engaged and engaging book again and again, to challenge myself tomake better arguments about the purposes that ought to govern reading andwriting about the Constitution. The epistemological imperative that drives Barber's jurisprudence is moralrealism: basically it is the idea that moral entities, like "justice,"have a real existence. Barber argues that moral realism is embedded in theConstitution, and celebrates its appearance in the writings of Publius,John Marshall, and Ronald Dworkin in order to defend the thesis that anoriginalist interpretation of the Constitution requires fidelity to individualand minority rights that justifies, and even mandates, Warren Court-likejudicial activism. Barber's animus is directed specifically against theNew Right (e.g., Raoul Berger and Robert Bork), and more generally againstelements of skepticism, relativism, antirationalism, and conventionalismwherever he finds them in constitutional commentary (e.g., in legal realismgenerally, and also in the writings of Alexander Bickel, Walter Berns, MichaelPerry, Stanley Fish, and even in the work of Ronald Dworkin whom he otherwisetakes up as an ally). Barber intends to convince us that opposition to moral realism, individualand minority rights, and judicial activism is indefensible because thatopposition cannot be justified successfully by the political philosophyof the founding, consistent and coherent theories of judicial review, orcontemporary ethical theory. He also would have us see the opposition tohis positions as a product of intellectually and morally degraded ethicaltheories that are inconsistent, incoherent, and just flat wrong when appliedto the normative structure and content of the Constitution. Moral realismis also identified as the best philosophical defense for a liberal civicculture that teaches citizens to be open to the heterogeneity of differencesof opinion, to commend themselves to the principle that differences areto be settled by reason, not force, and to aspire to search for politicaland moral truths in the same way as science teaches one to get closer tonatural truths. These are obviously exceptionally ambitious, to say nothingof contentious, intentions, and the author, more often then not, is up tofulfilling them. One of the great strengths of the inevitably abstract arguments made indefense of these intentions, and the criticisms or attacks (and make nomistake, these are sometimes attacks) against the opposition, is their accessibility.Barber's own arguments for moral realism and Constitutional interpretationare remarkable for their clarity, and readers will be readily able to assessthem for their authoritativeness and for how effective they are againstthe claims of relativism, skepticism, and conventionalism. Perhaps equally impressive is the internal logic of this work. Barber identifiesthis logic as "Socratic," and as I understand it as a model forapplying moral realism, it requires the intellectual and moral commitment,to oneself and others, to read the Constitution as embodying The Good (myword, not his). This is a commitment to the principle that the Constitutionembodies historically transcendent conceptions of rights and powers thatare TRUE and that one MUST strive to imitate, but should not expect to replicate,in the contingent world of politics. We meet this commitment by acceptingthe challenge that every belief and opinion, even moral realism, has tobe Page 8 follows: tested against the best versions of the truths of the Constitution we haveat our disposal. This commitment has an aesthetic beauty to it, not because I came away witha specific picture of the range of these Constitutional truths, but becausethe author's commitment to the values of consistency, coherence, and moralimagination is a noble, even brave, contrast to modernist, to say nothingof post- modernist, skepticism that, to some considerable extent, has underminedthose values and the very idea that those engaged in Constitutional interpretationare part of a shared moral and political enterprise that requires self-reflectionand self- constraint. On the other hand, however beautiful this commitment may be, Barber's Socraticabstract claims lead to some problems. One of these concerns the role ofphilosophy in defense of moral realism and judicial activism. Barber contendsthat a Socratic approach shifts the burden of proof on to those who woulddeny the imperatives of a moral realistic reading of what the Constitutionrequires. And one manifestation of this shift is an hostility to historyin the sense that it is always philosophy, and never history, that musthave the last word (pp. 68, 200). This shift becomes worrisome when Barber'sPublius -- much of which is familiar, but some of which arises out of Barber's"therapeutic" reconstruction of what Publius wrote (p. 49) --turns out to be a defender of a judicial monopoly of power that "honor[s]individual and minority rights" (pp. 32, 40). Now, on its own termsI found Barber's Publius interesting and persuasive; yet I also think thatRobert Burt's more historical (albeit mostly Madisonian) and more complicatedPublius, in THE CONSTITUTION IN CONFLICT (1992), which is less enthusiasticabout how much political sovereignty the Court deserves (Burt, p. 40), isjust as plausible as Barber's rendition. Thus the problem: why does fidelityto the Constitution require me to choose a philosophical over an historicalPublius as the basis for the truth about judicial activism? I, for one,do not have a positive answer to this question. I do know that pragmaticand consequentialist reasons are ruled out because Barber stipulates thatDworkin's jurisprudence "made the argument for moral philosophy soeffectively that all sides should have accepted it as a commonplace by now"(p. 68). But those benighted souls who are either disinclined to take Dworkinor Barber's word for the superiority of moral philosophy, or who are inclinedto think otherwise, are left, I think, with no other alternative but tolearn to love philosophy, and thereby the Constitution, or to leave themboth to those who do. The potentially stipulative aspect of philosophy and moral realism recapitulatesitself at two other levels as well. For example, Barber argues that in ourpolity, characterized as it is by conflicts over fundamental values, a commitmentto the Constitution requires legal philosophers "to impute underlyingvalues to a people despite their conflicts and in the face of historicalchange" (pp. 60-61). Barber recommends that these conflicts be viewed"as conflicting versions of some truly common good to which we allaspire, whether we know it or not (p. 108). I understand this commitmentto fundamental values as an exhortation, and indeed I sometimes share init. But I also am compelled to think about the well-argued and often poignantclaims made by those who write about the law and politics of differencesof gender, sexual, race, and class identity. These claims cast doubt onthe search for moral unity and integration, however self-reflective it maybe, because it is seen as a potentially inhumane and unjust exercise thatsacrifices differences for unity. These claims give me pause about the extentto which that exhortation for truth, and the confidence in philosophy behindit, oversimplifies the complicated, and perhaps, tragic problems in constitutionallaw and politics. And since Barber does not address substantive issues oflaw and politics, it is impossible to say whether or not moral realism givesitself over to such simplifications or not. At another level, there is the question of the audience for this Socraticapproach to the Constitution that is led by philosophers. The "compulsion"behind moral realism, says Barber, is "to get to the bottom of themoral questions that Page 9 follows: trouble ordinary citizens" (p. 217). This idea of being a philosopherto one's fellow citizens (p. 188) is a noble one, with historical antecedentsin both classical Greece and our own polity with Publius' Federalist Papers.But I wonder about such a role for a philosopher today, given what philosophydoes and what ordinary citizens need. To his credit, Barber is alive tothis question; he recalls Michael Walzer's warning about the gap betweenphilosophical reflection and the practical choices of politics, but onlyto summarily dismiss it by saying that Walzer ought to have understood "ordinaryprejudice" better by taking into account, from Barber's point of view,that nonacademic persons assume a difference between truth and convention. Quite aside from what may be an uncharitable (and unjust?) dismissal ofwhat Walzer understands and has done in his writing, those of us who readsocial scientific arguments, like McClosky and Brill on the dimensions ofintolerance in this polity (1983), are likely to wonder what it means tosay that "one's fellow citizens" hold to the difference betweentruth and convention when it comes to morality and politics. Indeed, onemight wonder whether abstract talk about citizens' conceptions of truthand convention can really include persons outside the classrooms of thebetter undergraduate institutions, and whether the issues that trouble ordinarycitizens, let alone their prejudices, are really on the Socratic agenda. Of course, all the problems that I have raised here might well be attributedto my skepticism about the role of philosophy in constitutional interpretation.But then I have the comforting thought that perhaps even my skepticism iswithin both the letter and the spirit of Barber's argument. After all, whatI have done is to raise doubts about where the Socratic approach takes me,but I have not rejected taking the trip. There can be but one Socrates,or an Aristotle; and the rest of us have to accept that we are a Cephalos,a Glaucon, an Adeimantus, or a Thrasymachus, and that means we do our bestto follow a teacher who wants us to try to make ourselves better than wewould otherwise be. The virtue of this book is that it challenges us tobe more self- reflective academics, and it is a challenge well worth thetaking. This is a delightful book. REFERENCES Burt, Robert A. (1992).

Barker and TwileyW. Barker, Jr. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall 1990. 689 pp. Paper$51.00. Reviewed by Lawrence Baum, Department of Political Science, Ohio State University Teachers of constitutional law courses today are served well by an arrayof good casebooks that take a variety of approaches. Lucius Barker and TwileyBarker have written the successive editions of CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE CONSTITUTIONwith a clear and consistent approach, one of emphasizing the broader politicaland social context of civil liberties law. With this approach, their bookis not aimed primarily at courses that give a strong emphasis to legal analysisof civil liberties decisions. Rather, it fits best in a course whose instructorgives substantial attention to constitutional politics as well as constitutionallaw. Like most other constitutional law books for political science courses,CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE CONSTITUTION is written at an appropriate levelfor upper-division students. It could be used in courses ranging in lengthfrom one quarter to two semesters. Depending on their course formats anduse of additional readings, instructors in shorter courses may wish to excludesome text material and cases. The book begins with an introductory chapter, followed by a series of chapterswith text material and case excerpts in the various areas of civil liberties.By chapter, civil liberties law is divided into six areas: religious liberty;freedom of expression, assembly and association; the rights of the accused;racial discrimination; political participation (chiefly legislative apportionmentand racial discrimination in the electoral process); and sex, privacy, andproperty. The introductory chapter deals primarily with the political and social contextof civil liberties law, including the roles of interest groups and of theother branches of government in constitutional politics. The text materialin later chapters focuses chiefly on cases and legal issues, and the bookassuredly is a text on the LAW of civil liberties. But the authors frequentlyrefer to the politics that shape the Supreme Court's decisions and to theimpact of those decisions. For instance, they give some emphasis to theeffect of changes in the Court's personnel on its doctrinal positions. Readersgain a clear sense of the larger context of constitutional law that Barkerand Barker seek to emphasize. Within chapters, the text and cases cover the great majority of issue areasto which the Supreme Court has given substantial attention. There are afew areas covered in some courses that the book does not treat as separatetopics. In equal protection, for instance, the authors focus on race, gender,and economic status; the text does not have sections on other distinctionssuch as that between citizens and non-citizens. To take another example,conflicts between national security and freedom of expression are discussedchiefly in the context of First Amendment doctrines, and there is no sectiondevoted specifically to the national security topic. Discussions of individual issue areas address a wide range of specific issueswithin them. But the text material does not offer a comprehensive treatiseon the areas that it covers; rather, it provides a picture of how the lawhas developed on the most important issues in each area, especially thosethat have been prominent in the Supreme Court's decisions. For instance,the section on the 4th Amendment focuses on the exclusionary rule and onwarrantless searches rather than describing all the general principles forinterpretation of the 4th Amendment. (Wiretapping also is discussed, inthe context of privacy.) In this respect the book follows what is probablythe majority practice in constitutional law texts for political sciencecourses. One advantage of this approach is that it helps to protect studentsfrom becoming overwhelmed with the array of legal issues and decisions ineach area. The book goes beyond constitutional issues to examine some statutory questionsconcerning discrimination. Among the cases Page 139 follows: included are some dealing with affirmative action programs under federalstatutes, WARDS COVE V. ATONIO (1989) on "disparate impact" underTitle VII, and GROVE CITY COLLEGE V. BELL (1984) on the scope of coverageof Title IX. Instructors easily could omit such cases and the associatedtext material if they wish. But I think that the book's inclusion of statutoryissues is a good feature, because it helps students to understand the importanceof both constitutional and statutory provisions in defining rights as wellas the interrelationship between them. The text material is very well written: it is both clear and interesting,and as a result it communicates effectively with students. This, of course,is a major virtue of the book. On the whole, material also is organizedwell within chapters. The number of excerpted cases in each area is withinthe standard range for political science casebooks, though probably smallerthan average. To take some examples, there are fourteen cases in the freedomof expression chapter, thirteen on the rights of the accused, and thirteenon racial discrimination. The authors provide a mix of major decisions from earlier eras and decisionsthat present the Court's current and recent positions on important issues.On capital punishment, the book includes GREGG V. GEORGIA (1976) along withSTANFORD V. KENTUCKY (1989) on execution of juveniles and McCLESKEY V. KEMP(1987) on racial discrimination; on search and seizure, it includes MAPPV. OHIO (1961), U.S. V. LEON (1984) (the "good faith" exceptionto the exclusionary rule), and CALIFORNIA V. GREENWOOD (1988) (warrantlesssearch of garbage). I like the selection of cases. Inevitably, some decisionsthat individual instructors would want students to read --including a fewdecisions that might be considered landmarks -- are not included. But theselected cases offer a good sample of major decisions, with a balance amongtopics and types of decisions. And they serve well in documenting shiftsover time in the Court's collective preferences and the resulting policieson a number of issues. The editing of cases emphasizes their settings and the justices' argumentsand holdings on the most fundamental civil liberties issues; the authorsare less concerned with conveying the Court's position on all the legalissues in each case. Thus, for instance, material on the standing issueis excised from ROE V. WADE. The editing is effective in achieving the authors'goals. The opinions are very readable, and I think they communicate thegist of cases quite well. The excerpts are particularly good in making clearthe essence of disagreements among members of the Court in particular cases. As my comments suggest, I think that CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE CONSTITUTIONhas some major strengths. First, the book's consistent reflection of itsauthors' concern with a balance between constitutional law and constitutionalpolitics serves well the needs of instructors who emphasize the politicalcontext of constitutional law in their courses. Second, the readabilityof both the text and the case excerpts enhances the book's value for studentsand increases the freedom of instructors to go beyond the material coveredin the book during class sessions. This is a fine book both in itself andas a text in civil liberties courses.

Barnett. New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1993. 182 pp. $42.95. Reviewed by Lawrence M. Friedman, Law School, Stanford University. This book has a simple thesis. Law, according to Barnett, is much more adependent than an independent variable. Legal doctrine changes when societyis ready for it to change, and not otherwise. People, however, tend to thinklaw is a powerful weapon for change, and they overestimate what it can accomplish;in fact, says Barnett, law is not an "effective means for treatingsocial problems" (p. 62). Apparently, law IS able to make somethingof a mark on economic problems -- it can "control" to some extent"the medium of exchange and arrangements for increasing wealth"(p. 162); but on such "social" matters as marriage and divorce,sex, discrimination against old people, euthanasia -- issues which Barnettdeals with in this book, it is quite ineffective. So far, so good. The problem lies in the demonstration. Barnett is convincedthat he can prove his thesis on the "macrosociological" level,that is, through aggregate, longitudinal data. Hence much of the book istaken up with the minute examination of statistical series -- trying, forexample, to explain why Congress passed age discrimination laws by tieingenactment to figures on the percentage of men in the labor force over acertain age; or connecting sex discrimination laws with rise and fall ofcollege enrollment rates of men and women. These attempts, frankly, strikeme as much too simplistic. They also rest on an assumption, which most readerswill simply reject, that the legal system automatically responds to whatsociety "needs." "Needs" is actually Barnett's own word;and he is quite serious about it. Law and legal thought, he says, respond"to the needs and values of society" (p. 17). Or again, at theend of the book, he distinguishes between "social conditions"and "societal needs." "Conditions" are "phenomenathat reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of a society;" while needsare "requirements of a society that must be satisfied if the systemis to maintain itself." Legal doctrine "reflects societal needsdirectly and societal conditions only indirectly" (p. 167). This point,if I understand it correctly, is both too optimistic and too mechanical.Societies can be quite blind as to what they really "need;" andthey may and indeed do act in ways that look quite crazy in hindsight. Idon't doubt for a minute that large-scale social changes have an impacton the legal system. This is, in fact, the basic premise of studies of lawand society. But the real question is HOW; and through what mechanisms;and in what sequence. Here I think Barnett does not help us as much as onemight like. Barnett is quite careful about statistics; less careful, I fear, about whatthese statistics measure. For example, in his chapter on euthanasia, hegoes out on a limb and predicts that laws against euthanasia are likelyto weaken or vanish. Why? Because public opinion is in favor of euthanasia.The evidence for this comes from Gallup polls, which have included a questionon euthanasia since 1947. The question is this: "When a person hasa disease that cannot be cured, do you think doctors should be allowed bylaw to end the patient's life by some painless means if the patient andhis family request it?" (p.141). But what does this question mean tothe people who answer it? (I myself would have trouble with the question,although I think if pressed I would have to say yes.) What is a "diseasethat cannot be cured?" Does it matter if the patient is or is not nearthe end? What precise situations were the respondents thinking of? How didthe people who answered the question understand it? Also, how deeply didthey feel about the subject? If they said yes, did they say yes out of passion,or were they basically indifferent with a slight edge to the yes side? Whatabout the people who said no? Surprisingly, Barnett seems unaware of oruninterested in problems of interpreting evidence from polls; or in theconceptual issues of defining "public opinion;" or in the relationshipbetween this kind of opinion and public, political action. Page 94 follows: I have reservations, too, about his notion that laws have no impact on "social"problems. He may well be right; but this is a complex issue and his datado not really prove the case. Take the Age Discrimination in EmploymentAct. Barnett marshals evidence that ADEA had no "appreciable impacton labor force participation"; senior citizens did not work in greaternumbers than before. He concludes that "labor force involvement...isnot a function of a statute banning discrimination but, rather, of large-scalesocial forces" (p. 90). We can concede this point. Still, was it thepurpose of ADEA to increase the number of 64 year olds who hold down jobs?Or was the purpose rather to end discrimination against those who DO wantto work? You cannot measure a lesser degree of discrimination -- or an increasein social justice; or, perhaps, a lessening of age-stereotypes -- with thiskind of blunt instrument. Anti-discrimination laws may be effective if theygive people a chance to get back at those who mistreat them; or if theyincrease the quantum of social justice. Large-scale aggregate statistics,about work-force participation, do not necessarily tell us if this is actuallyhappening. The point of ADEA was to let older people work if they WANT to;if many or most such people choose to retire, so be it. After all, divorcelaw reform is not a failure simply because the divorce rate stays the same. The book is clear and concise; and it attacks an important issue. That isall to the good. I applaud the enterprise, despite reservations about theway it is carried out.

New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993. 207 pp. Paperback. Reviewed by Richard A. Brisbin, Jr., Department of Political Science, WestVirginia University. Instructors who teach introductory judicial politics classes or introductoryAmerican politics classes will find much of value in these two paperbacktextbooks designed to introduce students to the U. S. Supreme Court. Althoughthese books from St. Martin's Press cover many of the same topics, thereare several substantial differences between them. Also, they differ in severalrespects from competing books released by other publishers. Both David Barnum and Thomas Walker and Lee Epstein detail the history andorganization of the federal appellate courts, the nature of judicial review,and the history of the Court. Walker and Epstein are very terse in the discussionof these topics, and they present data on judicial review through the useof their favorite illustrative device, the line graph. Barnum offers anadditional discussion of the democratic character of judicial review thatis in keeping with his greater attention to the normative dimensions ofthe judicial process, and his description of court organization and jurisdiction,offered in a separate chapter, and Supreme Court history, offered laterin his book, are much more elaborate. Walker and Epstein then discuss the selection of the justices, the justices'background characteristics, and court support personnel. Barnum postponesthe discussion of judicial selection until covering other material and treatsselection as a restraint on Court decision making rather than as a variableaffecting all aspects of the work of the Court. In comparison to Walkerand Epstein, his approach offers somewhat less data on the justices butadds historical information on the appointment process. Only Walker andEpstein discuss departures from the bench. Case selection receives extended treatment from Walker and Epstein. Theydiscuss trends in the Court's docket, with graphic illustrations, and thecertiorari decision making process with special attention to the influenceof the Solicitor General, interest groups, and ideology upon this process.Barnum covers the same topics, but his discussion of certiorari voting ismore formal, uses data less effectively to make its point, and is less attentiveto politics and the special role of the Solicitor General. Barnum adds aboxed comment on the Solicitor General later in the book, but he does notdirectly comment on the special role of the Solicitor General in certioraridecision making. Both books review the process of Supreme Court action through the announcementof opinions. In comparison to Barnum, Walker and Epstein offer a neatersummary of the structure of a term of the Court, more information aboutopinion assignment, and graphic information about dissenting and concurringopinions. The discussion of decision making in orally argued cases in both books proceedsfrom the individual level. Both books discuss the attitudinal or ideologicalmodel of judicial voting, but each qualify the strength of the model bydiscussing other individual level political variables and legal variables.To his credit, Barnum also notes the political environment within whichthe justices' decision making occurs. However, his discussion often movesincoherently from a discussion of external restraints as an independentvariable affecting decisions to a treatment of Court decisions as an independentvariable affecting on Congress, president and the public. Only Walker andEpstein spend time examining collegial pressures on decision making. Theirdepiction of external variables affecting decisions concentrates on interestgroups and not on the Congress or president. Page 44 follows: The discussion of the outcome of Court action by Walker and Epstein presentsempirical information on the topic and ideological direction of court decisions,then it moves on to discuss the impact of decisions. The impact discussionfollows the population model of Charles Johnson and Bradley Canon (1984).A final chapter cogently discusses whether the Court is a regime supporteror a more independent policy maker. Barnum presents data about the ideologicaldirection of Court decisions with his discussion of decision making. Hedoes not sort out the effect of the Court's decisions on external politicalactors very effectively by employing a model like that offered by Johnsonand Canon. In his final chapters he presents the normative arguments forand against judicial review. His final chapter assesses whether the Courtis a counter-majoritarian institution by examining public opinion data aboutseveral major issues. In contrast, Walker and Epstein offer only a passingreference to the normative dimensions of appellate justice. Both books haveglossaries of terms, appended data on the justices, and either chapter endor appended bibliographies for further reading. A significant difference between these books is Barnum's inclusion of sevencase studies of constitutional decision making. Although very brief andexclusively about rights and liberties issues, the case studies afford thestudent a portrait of the politics of the origins and impact of SupremeCourt decisions. Unfortunately, the studies are much stronger as examplesof how a case arrives at the Court and the construction of opinions in thecase than as examples of the policy impact of the Court. They offer toolittle discussion of how a major rights case is only the beginning of apolitical struggle, a struggle in which the role of the Court is often minimal. The primary competitors of these books are texts by Lawrence Baum (1992)and Stephen Wasby (1988). Baum covers the same topics in the same orderas Walker and Epstein. His chapter on certiorari decisions is better organizedthan either Barnum or Walker and Epstein, and he makes more use of the newfindings of H. W. Perry about certiorari decisions. Baum's discussion ofdecision making, featuring an ample presentation of data, is much more relianton the attitudinal or ideological model. His chapters on compliance andimpact use a unique policy implementation approach. He spends less timeon the Court and public opinion or legitimacy than does Barnum, and he isless direct in considering the role of the Court in the political systemthan Walker and Epstein. Interestingly, on several occasions Barnum citesinformation found in Baum's book. Because he provides much more historical information and many more examplesof Court procedures and processes, Wasby's book is much longer than thebooks of Barnum, Walker and Epstein, and Baum. Also, Wasby provides moredescriptive information and fewer presentations of data about interest grouplitigation, federal court administration, and the overall appellate process.However, all of the additional detail makes his account less concise andprobably more distracting for the introductory student in an era when manystudents regard reading as a chore. Although each instructor must choose her text with consideration of herpedagogical aims, as a discussion of judicial behavior in the Supreme Court,this reviewer finds the Walker and Epstein book to be a more logically organizedand stronger summary of existing knowledge. Barnum's is a book for instructorswho want to concentrate on the normative implications of the Court for Americandemocracy. However, instructors should be forewarned that neither book discussesat length the vital role of the Court in statutory construction and theoversight of the administrative process. Barnum especially implies thatthe business of the Court is judicial review. Also, neither book pointsto the uniqueness and selective impact of the Supreme Court in Americanpolitics by comparing it to the different but important policy roles ofthe other levels of the judiciary which order family, debt, accidental injury,criminal, and other socioeconomic problems. Despite these caveats, bothbooks have a useful role to play for education in American Page 45 follows: judicial politics. References: Baum, Lawrence. 1992. THE SUPREME COURT, fourth ed.

McCann, Editor AMERICAN COURTS: PROCESS AND POLICY (3rd ed.) by Lawrence Baum. Boston:Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. 369 pp. Paper $ 29.95. Reviewed by Lynn Mather, Department of Government, Dartmouth College. As recently as ten or fifteen years ago, faculty teaching judicial processcourses were hard-pressed to find a text that would fit the bill. Therewere a few excellent readers with essay collections, but very few singlebooks that focused exclusively on courts in the United States and that includedstate as well as federal courts. Baum's AMERICAN COURTS: PROCESS AND POLICYis one of a number of outstanding recent books which can serve as first-ratetexts in a judicial process course. If this series of book reviews on judicialprocess texts shows nothing else, it demonstrates how dramatically the fieldhas changed and how the rich scholarship on courts in American society hasfinally made its way into texts for undergraduates. Lawrence Baum's AMERICAN COURTS: PROCESS AND POLICY, now in its third edition,is a solid, fact-filled text. Baum writes that the book's major goals aredescription and explanation of how and why courts work the way they do.A third -- but admittedly less important -- goal for the book is "toprovide the necessary basis for judging reform proposals" (p. x). Overall,I think that the text succeeds in meeting these goals; descriptive and explanatoryanalysis do (as promised in the introduction) dominate the discussion, butsome normative analysis is introduced. Like most judicial process texts,Baum's book concentrates exclusively on American courts. The instructorwho seeks a more comparative view will have to introduce it through lecturesand other readings. The conceptual frame of the book is primarily behavioral. At the outset,Baum introduces three general perspectives for understanding court processesand outcomes: "the legal, the environmental, and the personal"(p. 11). After explaining the benefits and limits of each view, and notingthat he will employ all of these perspectives in the book, Baum concludesthat he "will give primary emphasis to the personal perspective, andespecially to the motives that underlie choices made by people in the courts"(p. 17). I like the fact that the book introduces different theoreticalapproaches and then explicitly identifies the dominant approach of the text.In this way, faculty who wish to introduce competing perspectives can presentalternative materials to supplement AMERICAN COURTS. One consequence of the "personal" perspective is the relativeattention that the book gives to various topics. The bulk of the book addresseslegal actors and legal processes, with much less attention to policy issues.The book is organized in a fashion typical of most judicial process texts(and courses). Chapters 1 and 2 present "An Overview of the Courts"and "Court Organization." The next three chapters discuss "Lawyers,""Selection of Judges," and "Judges." Chapters 6-8 covercourt processes, "Trial Courts: Criminal Cases," "Trial Courts:Civil Cases," and "Appellate Courts: The Process." A finalchapter addresses "Appellate Courts as Policy Makers." The chapterson lawyers, judges, and court processes are rich and comprehensive, drawingextensively on the literature in the Page 96 follows: field and presenting clear description and synthetic analysis. The book devotes much more attention to court process, however, than tocourt outcomes. Only the last chapter discusses court policies in any depth,with sections on "Appellate Court Decisions as Policies" (on appellatecourt agendas, ideological patterns, and judicial activism) and "TheImpact of Appellate Court Decisions" (covering the literature on implementationand impact). The chapter on civil court processes also includes excellentsections on the "litigation explosion," and on Galanter's argumenton "Why the Haves Come out Ahead," in which Baum evaluates civilcourt outcomes in areas of personal injury, debt collection, and divorce.But many of the normative concerns that are raised elsewhere in the bookfocus more on issues internal to the legal system, rather than on the politicaland social impact of courts on society. For example, in the section on criminalsentencing, Baum explains the sentencing process and evaluates the questionof consistency among judges in sentencing, but does not discuss trends onincarceration or the use of probation. Other evaluative or critical sectionsfocus on issues such as court unification, competence of lawyers and judges,and the effectiveness of trial decision-making. A second consequence of the book's "personal" perspective is thatthe book is filled with data about people -- about lawyers and judges whosepersonal and political conflicts and interests show how courts work. Forexample, the chapter on court organization opens with an anecdote abouta 1990 bill to split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals into two parts,California, Arizona and Nevada in one, and the Northwestern states in theother. Senator Gorton of Washington sponsored the bill so that states inthe Northwest could escape what he called the domination "by Californiajudges and by California attitudes" while California Senator Pete Wilsonopposed it as "environmental gerrymandering" (p. 21). Baum explainsthat "splitting the circuit would prevent California judges from rulingon environmental cases in the Northwest, and judges who came from the Northwestthemselves might be more sympathetic toward industries that were importantto the region's economy" (pp. 21-22). In another example, the bookuses the 1989 battle between Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose and baseballcommissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti to illustrate forum-shopping in diversityjurisdiction. Rose sought to have his case heard in Ohio state court beforean elected judge from Cincinnati, rather than before an unelected judgefrom Columbus in federal district court. These stories of personal and political conflict make for fascinating reading.Thus, the text will appeal to undergraduates because of its lively, well-illustrated,and occasionally humorous presentation of court processes. These are realpeople making law, not abstract institutions or arcane rules. Moreover,the legal realist conception of law and courts will resonate with today'scynical and media-saturated students. For instance, when discussing lawyercompetence, Baum cites Judge Bazelon's comment that many criminal defenselawyers are "walking violations of the Sixth Amendment" (p. 87).Or, in the section on entry into the legal profession, Baum tells the storyof a man arrested for Page 97 follows: impersonating a criminal defense lawyer in court; the judge supposedly remarked,"I should have suspected he wasn't a lawyer. He was always so punctualand polite" (p. 59). While descriptions of people and process abound in the book, Baum presentsfewer discussions of law and legal principles. Judges are quoted for remarkssuch as these, or for their acid-tongued disagreements with each other,but not for their statements of law. Instructors who use this book may wantto supplement it with court decisions and other reading which analyzes lawin terms of legal reasoning, language, or ideology. A real strength of Baum's book is its readability, clarity, and tone. Mystudents found it very interesting and informative to read. One studentexplained to me that she sold all her other books at the end of the termbut kept AMERICAN COURTS: PROCESS AND POLICY because "it was so basic.. . you never know when you'll need to know these things about courts."The text draws on political science and legal scholarship, as well as numerousnewspaper articles. The wealth of data in the book is impressive especiallyfor the specific cases, surveys, and research studies used to illustrateand support the analysis. Baum is also very even-handed when presentingcontroversial topics, underscoring the complexity of research and the waysin which values can influence the interpretation of results. This kind ofcaution encourages students to think carefully about how to use data tosupport their arguments and to be self-conscious about their own and others'biases. One small weakness of the book in my mind is its slight tilt towards federallaw and courts. Although the book has excellent chapters on trial courtprocesses (including state courts), elsewhere the federal courts are presentedas the more important courts. For example, Baum states that "only asmall proportion of all court cases are tried in federal court because thegreat majority of cases fit under no category of federal jurisdiction andthus go to the state courts by default" (p. 24). Clearly the statecourts are not just a residual category for leftover federal cases! Also,the discussion of the superiority of federal constitutional law over stateconstitutional law (p. 3) could mislead students in their understandingof judicial federalism in which state constitutional law has sometimes providedfor greater individual rights than has federal constitutional law. Finally, I have to say I think this book is somewhat overpriced. This weaknessis no fault of Baum's but his publisher really needs to do some comparativeprice checking. AMERICAN COURTS: PROCESS AND POLICY is one of the more expensivejudicial process texts on a per page basis of any of those listed in thecurrent series under review. This paperback text would be more appropriatelypriced at $22 or $25 to put it line with other similarly-sized books (ratherthan the $30 recommended price). It would be too bad if cost deters facultyfrom using what is otherwise an excellent judicial process text.

Beller and JohnW. Graham, Yale University Press, 1993 Reviewed by: Jessica Pearson, Center for Policy Research, Denver, Colorado In their book, SMALL CHANGE: THE ECONOMICS OF CHILD SUPPORT, Andrea Bellerand John Graham examine aggregate trends in child support over the period1978-1986. Their analyses rely on data gleaned in the child support supplementto the Current Population Survey, first administered in 1979 and conductedbiennially thereafter. The combined data set they manipulate contains informationabout 16,000 mothers eligible for child support including 4,000 black and3,000 never married mothers. This allows the authors to compare child supportexperience for blacks and non-blacks, married and never-married parents.Their analyses occur within a framework of economic modelling that emphasizesthe benefits and costs of child support for mothers and the fathers' abilityand willingness to pay in explaining child support outcomes. Beller and Graham reach a number of conclusions about the child supportsystem and how it has evolved during a time period of increasing federalinvolvement. Their findings underscore the inadequacy of the system forblack and never married women, sub- groups that have grown disproportionatelyin the last few decades. On virtually every indicator of child support outcome,these women fare dramatically worse than their non-black and ever-marriedcounterparts. Granted, AFDC recipients, many of whom are black and/or nevermarried, have received disproportionate enforcement attention by child supportagencies and these populations have consequently experienced certain increasesin award and collection rates. Nevertheless, their overall standing withrespect to awards, order levels and receipts lag far behind. Although theauthors do not focus on the policy implications of this finding, it doesraise serious questions about the whole premise of private transfer as aremedy for those with out-of-wedlock births and minority poverty. Among non-black and ever-married women, the authors find evidence of onlysmall increases in award and receipt rates, suggesting that efforts to strengthenchild support enforcement may have been partially successful. Although theyfind no evidence that government spending for child support has increasedchild support receipts, they find some evidence that certain enforcementtechniques have been helpful including criminal penalties and wage withholding.Administrative procedures, on the other hand, appear to be associated withlower receipt rates. It should be noted that these data were collected priorto the implementation of many new aggressive enforcement remedies. In any event, evidence of modest increases in award and receipt rates weremore than offset by a 25 percent decline in the real dollar amount of childsupport payments made during 1978-1986. The authors attribute this to thefailure of child support order levels to keep up with inflation and changesin the real incomes of fathers, although they note that real incomes offathers stagnated after 1973. The obvious remedy to this problem is theutilization of child support guidelines to establish order levels that reflectparental income. This too became mandatory in 1988 pursuant to the enactmentof the Family Support Act, along with requirements for periodic review andupdating of old awards at the request of either party. Again, given thetime frame of their study, Beller and Graham offer no reading on the impactof these and other provisions of the Child Support Enforcement Amendmentsof 1984 and the 1988 Family Support Act. My biggest frustration with this book is that it feels out of date. Thelast year for which data was utilized in this study was 1986. Since then,legislation has been enacted requiring states to improve paternity establishmentor face financial penalties, utilize presumptive child support guidelines,institute periodic updating of child support awards and routinely use income Page 110 follows: withholding and other enforcement remedies. The architects of child supportguidelines and other remedies embodied in recent legislation have predicteddramatic impacts on child support award and payment patterns. The researchthat my colleagues and I have conducted comparing awards promulgated priorto and following the adoption of presumptive guidelines in specific jurisdictionssuggests that these impacts have been extremely modest. Has the new legislationtranslated into substantial gains? Which sub-groups, if any, have benefitted?Why and why not? To my mind, these are the vital questions that need tobe addressed. Unfortunately, this book does not do the job. Another frustration I have with this book is the nature of the CPS datathey utilized to operationalize the variables in their model. Father's abilityto pay was measured by the socioeconomic characteristics of mothers andwas supplemented by mean income data of year-round, full-time male workersby race. In a similar vein, information about the mother was used to representfather's desire to pay child support. Even mother's expected benefits andcosts were indirectly measured through the limited available data on hermarital status, education level and numbers and ages of her children. Therewere absolutely no direct measures of many of the determinants of childsupport outcomes including father's income, father's employment status andstability, father's remarriage, current living arrangements for mothersand fathers, custody and visitation arrangements and the relationship betweenthe parents. The authors concede these limitations but indicate that they aren't so criticalgiven their interest in revealing racial and marital status differentialsand trends over time. Critical or not, the result is a limited book thatdocuments what is obvious to anyone who has worked with the child supportsystem: that it is bad for everyone but worse for blacks and never-marrieds.

Princeton: PrincetonUniversity Press, 1993. 241 pp. Cloth $29.95. Reviewed by Robert J. Beck, Woodrow Wilson Department of Government andForeign Affairs, University of Virginia. Eyal Benvenisti's important new book explores the international legal dimensionsof what scholars traditionally have termed "belligerent occupation."His purpose is "to understand the arrangement that the internationalcommunity has devised for settling the possible conflicts of interest betweenoccupant and occupied and to assess the shortcomings and challenges of sucha system" (p. 6). Benvenisti's study is admirably well researched,structured, and written; indeed, in its Yale doctoral dissertation iteration,it received the Law School's Ambrose Gherini Prize. Nevertheless, upon readinghis comprehensive examination of state practice since 1914, one wondersif the work might better have been entitled, AN INTERNATIONAL LAW OF OCCUPATION? Benvenisti defines occupation as "the effective control of a power(be it one or more states or an international organization, such as theUnited Nations) over a territory to which that power has no sovereign title,without the volition of the sovereign of that territory" (p. 4). Herejects the less inclusive terms of "belligerent" and "wartime"occupation because twentieth century history "has shown that occupationis not necessarily the outcome of actual fighting" (p. 3). Though ProfessorBenvenisti did not do so, he might also have formally defined "annexation"in order to distinguish that concept more clearly from "occupation." Four principal scholarly tasks are undertaken in Benvenisti's monograph.First, in Chapters 1 and 2, the author sets out clearly the framework ofthe law of occupation, focusing especially on Article 43 of the Hague ConventionRegulations, "the gist of the law" (p. 7). Second, Benvenistiskillfully traces over eight decades the evolution of the state practiceof occupation. Chapters 3 through 6 examine in succession the cases of:World War I; World War II; Israel's occupations of the Golan Heights, theWest Bank, Gaza, and Sinai; and the more recent occupations of Kuwait, WesternSahara, East Timor, Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Grenada, Panama, Bangladesh,Northern Cyprus, Iraq, and Southern Lebanon. Third, Benvenisti assessesin Chapter 7 the prospects for enforcement of the law by existing domesticand international institutions. Here, he concludes that adjudication andenforcement through "protecting powers" do not "seem at presentto be capable of meeting the challenges facing the law," but that internationalglobal and regional organizations are "promising" mechanisms (p.207). Finally, in Chapter 8, he offers "his own reading" of thelaw "in an effort to accommodate it to contemporary challenges"(p. 209). Professor Benvenisti identifies three predominant trends in this centurythat have transformed the law of occupation. First, the role of centralgovernments has expanded substantially, and with profound internationallegal implications. "At the heart of almost every modern occupation,"Benvenisti contends, "lies a conflict of interest among the occupant,the local population, and the ousted government, a conflict over policiesand goals." Thus, the contemporary occupant "is no longer theimpartial trustee of indigenous private interests ... envisioned in theHague Regulations" (p. 210). Second, the international community hasplaced an increasing emphasis on personal and communal rights. This shifthas manifested itself both in international prescriptions designed to protectindividuals, and in the increasing approval of "indigenous community"claims at the expense of ousted government interests (pp. 210-11). Third,occupants have regularly failed to acknowledge their rules as "occupations."This unhappy tendency has reflected state government desires to justifytheir forcible actions, their interests in establishing titles to territory,and their recognitions that "occupation" has acquired a pejorativeconnotation (pp. 211-12). Page 89 follows: THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF OCCUPATION constitutes a valuable contributionto the literatures of international law and international relations, andwill surely prove of great interest to students of both disciplines, particularlyin light of recent changes in Israel's occupation. Traditional works onbelligerent occupation tended to reflect solely the Hague Regulations, andto be strictly legal in orientation; newer ones have generally consistedonly of narrow historical or legal analyses of specific occupations. Hence,the comprehensive, multi-dimensional quality of Benvenisti's study genuinelydistinguishes it; the book's extensive bibliography and table of cases furtherenhance its utility. Though Benvenisti's book lacks any extended discussion of internationallegal methodology, his approach nevertheless reflects certain prominentaspects of the Lasswell-McDougal jurisprudence, the so-called "NewHaven School." OCCUPATION evinces, for example, an appreciation ofinternational law's dynamism and its authority, of governmental concernsfor their power bases; it displays a sensitivity to law's histori- cal/political context and to the expectations of international actors; itfocuses squarely on the process of actor claims and reactions. That Benvenisti'sproject should be so oriented is not surprising given that, at the dissertationstage, it was directed by W. Michael Reisman. A cogent work would have beeneven more compelling, however, if it had offered an explicit definitionof, or a test for, "international law." Benvenisti never makesclear precisely how one ascertains what "the law" is, what hierarchicalrelationship exists (if any) between formal legal instruments and statepractice, or even if any legally significant distinction exists betweenSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions. In 1990 Thomas Franck observed that "the extensive body of international`law'" on the use of force, "oft restated in solemn texts, ...simply, if sadly, is not predictive of the ways of the world" (1990,32). The same can also surely be said of this century's international lawof occupation. Indeed, it is tempting to question seriously whether anygenuine "law" of occupation ever existed at least, if one understands"law" as "authoritative and controlling state practice"(Arend and Beck, 1993, 9-10). Benvenisti, himself, appears at times nearly to embrace this conclusion.He concedes in his introduction, for example: "In exploring the phenomenonof occupation, I was struck by the fact that most contemporary occupantsignored their status and their duties" (p. 6). Later, in his discussionof World War II occupations, he admits that "there is sufficient groundto claim that in light of the recurring disregard of the law of occupation,the Hague Regulations had lost their legal authority by the end of the war"(p. 58). In reviewing contemporary state practice, moreover, Benvenistiwrites: Careful analysis reveals that in all of the recent cases of occupation,except for the Israeli control of the West Bank (not including East Jerusalem)and Gaza, the framework of the law of occupation was not followed even ona de facto basis. No occupant in the past two decades has established atemporary government that could effectively balance the conflicting interestsof the occupant and occupied, nor did any occupant (except for Israel) invokethe Hague Regulations or the Fourth Geneva Convention to justify its measures.(pp. 189- 190) And in his final chapter, he submits: It is ... my expectation that few future occupants will voluntarily recognizethe applicability of the law of occupation. Occupants who deny its applicabilityare likely not to consider themselves bound by its commands, even on a defacto basis. Thus, the tendency to ignore the basic com- Page 90 follows: mands of the law of occupation seems to pose the most potentially destructivechallenge to its survival. (p. 212) This sober assessment must cast some doubt upon the vitality of the internationallaw of occupation, but it reflects as well the clarity and intellectualhonesty that characterize Eyal Benvenisti's excellent book.

Crowley, Department of Political Science, Universityof Idaho Joan Biskupic's SUPREME COURT YEARBOOK: 1990-1991 is the second in whatis planned to be a yearly account of the most recently completed SupremeCourt term. The book provides an overview of the major developments on theCourt, short summaries of all the Court's written decisions during the year,and longer excerpts of ten of the most important cases. The book also includesa brief preview of cases likely to be decided in the next term and concludeswith a short description of Court procedures. An Appendix contains biographiesof the current Justices and a glossary of legal terms. The book seeks to provide an account of the Court's term in a manner thatis accessible to students and non-specialists. In this I think Ms. Biskupicis largely successful. However, whether such a yearbook can be fully understoodand appreciated without at least a reasonable background in past SupremeCourt decision making is open to debate. As with any treatment of the yearlydevelopments of an institution, there is the problem of historical context,although in a class this could be easily remedied by assignment of one ofmany texts that provides the type of historic overview necessary to givemeaning to current developments. Since the YEARBOOK is intended to be a review of the previous terms majordevelopments the book doesn't really have a central thesis. In the firsttwo chapters Biskupic does raise issues regarding recent appointments andthe effect Justices Souter and Thomas are likely to have in solidifyingthe conservative majority on the Court. However, such themes are not reallythe point of the work and thus are not developed in any systematic way. In the first chapter Ms. Biskupic's provides a brief overview of the politicalturmoil surrounding the Thomas nomination. Touching on the highpoints (orlowpoints) of the confirmation proceedings and the Anita Hill testimony,Biskupic's account is well done even though those who followed the dramatichearings culminating in Thomas' confirmation will find nothing new or surprising. The second chapter provides a very brief discussion of the growing conservatismof the Court and then slides into summaries of what Biskupic considers tobe the most important cases decided by the Court during the 1990-1991 term.The summaries of major decisions are quite competently done, however anyonelooking for analysis of the doctrinal trends or deeper significance of thedecisions is likely to be disappointed. The next two chapters constitute the bulk of the book. The third chapterprovides brief summaries of the 112 signed opinions written by the Courtlast term. The decisions are grouped by general topic (Business Law, CriminalLaw, Individual Rights, etc.) and each summary contains the Court vote andthe majority holding. By summarizing all decisions Biskupic clearly providesa service since other Supreme Court updates have only covered a few selectedcases. The fourth chapter contains somewhat longer excerpts from the tenmajor cases first discussed in chapter two. No doubt this can be a usefulshelf resource to those who don't have ready access to U.S REPORTS or U.SLAW WEEK. As a prelude to reviewing what's on the Court docket for this year, thefifth chapter contains a nice discussion of the current debate over JusticeScalia's attempt to get the Court to ignore legislative history and focusonly on the actual language in determining the meaning of a statute. Biskupicnotes but does not elaborate on the ideological effect of reading Congressionalintent narrowly while allowing executive branch agencies in cases like RUSTv. SULLIVAN broad scope to apply its understanding of Congressional intent. Page 94 follows: Such positioning by Scalia and his colleagues raises the question of whetherthey are really that sympathetic to executive branch prerogatives or aresimply in tune with the ideological direction of executive branch decisions.Biskupic is certainly right to point to these developments in statutoryinterpretation as one of the more important trends to watch for as the RehnquistCourt begins to take on its own identity. While Joan Biskupic's SUPREME COURT YEARBOOK doesn't pretend to supply avery detailed analysis of recent cases or larger decision making trends,it should nevertheless serve as a very handy reference for those who teachundergraduate courses focusing on the Supreme Court. I certainly plan topurchase future editions to use as a quick reference source. The book couldalso be used as a supplementary text for some courses, although I suspectthe scarcity of analysis and historical context could be a major stumblingblock to those with insufficient background.

Chicago: University of ChicagoPress, 1994. 148 pp. Cloth $19.95. Reviewed by Paul Burstein, Department of Sociology, University of Washington When Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the unemployment ratefor black men and women was double that for whites. Much of this difference,proponents of the Act argued, was the result of discrimination by employers,unions, and employment agencies. By prohibiting such discrimination, TitleVII of the Act was to win access for blacks to jobs formerly closed to them-- it would reduce black unemployment and enable them to move along withwhites on the road to economic success. More than thirty years later, after the development of new, sweeping definitionsof discrimination, the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars toenforce Title VII and other equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws andregulations, and victory by black workers in thousands of employment discriminationcases, the unemployment rate for black men and women is -- double that forwhites. It is this conundrum which motivates Farrell Bloch's book. Why has EEO law(including, for our purposes, executive orders and regulations) proven tobe so ineffectual? Why have the hopes of those who fought so long and sohard for Title VII not been fulfilled? Bloch proposes four reasons. First, although the federal government apparentlyhas the power to get employers it monitors closely -- large employers andfederal contractors -- to hire more blacks, the blacks they recruit areapparently those who would be employed anyway, at smaller firms and firmswithout federal contracts. The latter apparently do NOT make up for theirloss of black employees by hiring from among the black unemployed. Net result:no gain in total black employment. Second, Bloch claims, the EEO laws may actually discourage employers fromhiring blacks. Although the laws prohibit discrimination both in hiringand on the job, applicants are much less likely than employees to file discriminationlawsuits. For employers, therefore, it may make sense to avoid hiring potentiallylitigious applicants in the first place. Third, much hiring is done through word-of-mouth recruitment. With proportionatelymore whites and Asians than blacks in a position to hire (because they controlmost firms), such recruitment disadvantages blacks; yet it is difficultto see how the EEO laws can prevent people from using their personal contactsto find work. Finally, Bloch argues, some criteria employers use to screenapplicants exclude blacks disproportionately often -- an example is havinga criminal record. All of these arguments have been made before, but it is not Bloch's goalto be original. Instead, he wants to (1) summarize what is known about theimpact of EEO law for a "diverse audience, including students, humanresources professionals, and attorneys" Page 148 follows: as well as social scientists (p. 5); (2) place particular emphasis on howrecruitment practices affect racial differences in unemployment; and (3)propose more effective ways of reducing black unemployment. Bloch's summary of others' work on the impact of EEO law would in fact beuseful for its intended audience; it is wide-ranging, accurate and easyto comprehend. Nevertheless, it is problematic in at least two importantways not necessarily obvious to its intended audience. First is Bloch's attempt to focus on unemployment rather than on earningsor access to occupations. There are good reasons to be concerned about black-whitedifferences in unemployment; the unemployed not only have lower incomesthan the employed, but they are also less attached to major institutions,less likely to form stable families, and less likely to contribute to communitylife in constructive ways. Nevertheless, most work on the impact of EEOlaw rightly focuses on how it affects earnings or access to occupations;most adults are employed, and it is how well they are doing which is mostimportant for assessing group progress. As it turns out, Bloch is partially saved by his own inconsistency. He sayshis focus is unemployment, but he actually summarizes work on earnings andaccess to occupations as well. Bloch's readers will thus learn more thanhe promises. Unfortunately, they may also come away with a somewhat confusedimpression of work on EEO law because of Bloch's failure to distinguishcarefully between its impact on unemployment, on earnings, and on accessto occupations. The second way in which the summary is problematic lies in its treatmentof theory and evidence. Bloch presents his argument rather informally, mixingeconomic theory, legal analysis, summaries of others' empirical work, U.S.government statistics, and anecdotes about particular EEO cases. Such informalityarguably makes sense, given the intended audience. Yet such informalitymay -- and in this case, does -- have a price. Much of what Bloch says aboutthe apparent weakness of EEO law rests on economic theory: for example,how employers wishing to avoid being sued have incentives not to hire blacks,or why employers find it especially efficient to recruit employees throughword-of-mouth, to the detriment of blacks. Only the most careful and methodologicallysophisticated reader is likely to notice how little hard evidence thereis to support the theoretical arguments. Most of what Bloch says will seemplausible, or even convincing, to those inclined to accept the economicarguments on which it rests. But those who would like to know whether itis really true that employers resist hiring blacks because they believethat reduces their exposure to litigation, will not find the evidence inBloch's book. To be fair, the evidence is not in Bloch's book because it is simply notavailable anywhere. At times, Bloch acknowledges that his conclusion thatEEO law has had little impact could be undermined by evidence not yet available-- evidence showing, for example, that the impact of EEO law has been underestimatedbecause it has been offset by the loss of manufacturing jobs, Page 149 follows: the impact of inner-city crime and other factors. He fails, however, topoint out how little evidence there is for many of the points in his theoreticalargument; it would be very easy for the reader to come away from his bookthinking we understand far more about black unemployment or earnings thanwe actually do. Bloch's book also reflects another weakness of others' work on EEO law:like many of the economists whose work he cites, he claims to be writingabout MINORITIES, but really focuses almost entirely on MINORITY MEN. Heshows that black women as well as men suffer from much higher unemploymentrates than whites, but fails to note that their earnings and access to occupationshave improved more rapidly than black men's, almost certainly due in partto EEO law. Indeed, black women's earnings approach those of white women,and some social scientists have argued that although black women continueto suffer from sex discrimination, they are harmed relatively little byrace discrimination in the labor market. Bloch's (and others') neglect of black women is objectionable not only inprinciple, but because it affects the credibility of his argument as well.Bloch attributes the apparent failure of EEO law in part to blacks' isolationfrom jobs and recruitment networks, and in part to the incentives EEO lawinadvertently gives employers to avoid hiring members of protected groups.His logic should apply to black women as well as men, yet they do not seemedto be harmed to the same extent. The book would be more convincing if itconsidered not only why EEO law is likely to be ineffective, but also whyit may be less ineffective for some groups than for others. Bloch's policy proposals are for the most part quite conventional amongeconomists: he argues that employment opportunities for blacks would beimproved by full employment, reducing or eliminating the minimum wage andoccupational licensing requirements, reducing taxes, expanding particularkinds of job-training programs, reducing inner-city crime, and encouragingthe growth of black-owned businesses. His own, new proposal calls for makingit easier to disseminate information about jobs and job applicants throughinteractive telephone communication of the sort people use to get informationabout their bank accounts. Overall, Bloch's book is useful in two ways. First, he effectively summarizesmuch of what we know about the impact of EEO law. Second, he argues convincinglythat social and economic processes beyond the reach of EEO law -- particularlyinformal recruitment to jobs, the development of entrepreneurship in minoritiescommunities, and the disintegration of inner cities -- work strongly tothe disadvantage of blacks. Nevertheless, those wanting a sophisticatedand non-technical introduction to EEO law and its consequences would stillfind it especially worthwhile to read Alfred Blumrosen's MODERN LAW (Universityof Wisconsin Press, 1993) and the well-known exchange between James Smithand Finis Welch on one side and John Donohue III and James Heckman on theother ("Black Economic Progress After Myrdal," Page 150 follows: JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE 27 [1989]:519-54, and "Continuous versusEpisodic Change: The Impact of Civil Rights Policy on the Economic Statusof Blacks," JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE 29 [1991]:1603-43).

Blomberg and Stanley Cohen (Editors) New York: Aldine deGruyter, 1995. 318 pp. Cloth $46.95 (text adoption price on ten or more copies: $27.95) Reviewed by Todd R. Clear, School of Criminal Justice, Rutgers University This FESTSCHRIFT is a collection of sixteen original essays published to mark the retirementof Sheldon L. Messinger. The topics covered are central to the study of formal social controltheory and practice; the authors include some of the foremost contemporary critics of socialcontrol, writing on subjects for which they are well known. That this is an impressive volume is due in large part to the stature of the contributors and theimportance of their chosen topics. Among the writers and their topics are David Rothman on themodern history of justice reform, Gresham Sykes on imprisonment, Egon Bittner on policing,David Garland on penal postmodernism, David Matza on drug policy, Richard Berk and RichardFreeman on the measurement of crime, and Alfred Blumstein on punishment trends. The othercontributors are as able and well-known. The result is a valuable and original set of essays thatwill be enjoyed by student and established scholar alike. The versatility of this collection will recommend it as a supplemental text to undergraduateclasses on various topics of crime control. The sophistication of many of the papers means thebook will also serve the well as a graduate-level text. It is unusual to find a book with suchbroad usefulness, but this anthology accomplishes the difficult trifecta of coverage, creativity,and depth. Some of the selections are closely related to previously published work. Gary T. Marx'sassessment of undercover policing, Andrew von Hirsch's commentary on the future ofproportionate sentencing, Alfred Blumstein's revisit to the stability of punishment hypothesis,and Jonathon Simon and Malcolm Feeley's critique of the new penology fit into this group. Eachis an extension of previous work, offering palatable refinements to well-developed arguments. Scholars will find these selections reliable extensions, while students will be stimulated toponder more thoroughly the contributions they augment. In a volume of valuable essays, three stand out as remarkable, for quite different reasons:Garland's commentary on postmodernism, Berk and Freedman's exposition on crimemeasurement, and Gilbert Geis's account of the demise of the School of Criminology atBerkeley. Garland writes with his usual easy confidence, putting into theoretically accessible order thehodge-podge of trends and programs that has been our modern penal experience. He linkstogether with a critical eye the managerial frame of reference of correctional administration, therisk-management technologies of line practice, and the politicization of penal policy to argue fora POSTMODERN view of penality. He then criticizes the accuracy of this conclusion. Onedetects a hint of whimsical romanticism about the good old days of "rehabilitation" Page 63 follows: MODERNISM, a subtext that is not only curious, given his earlier writing, but also a bitannoying. (Compare it to Pat Carlen's complaint immediately following that penal policy aboutwomen uses repressive ideologies of "rehabilitation" to reconstruct the women into modelsacceptable to male hegemony.) Yet the treatise holds together, placing today's penal knowledgeinto a broader theoretical paradigm dominant in the social sciences and philosophy. Berk and Freedman's essay on the statistical assumptions underlying the measurement of crime isa delightful exposition on selected analytic problems in the mathematics of crime. The paperdiscusses various statistical concerns: assumptions about the nature of the sampling population,spatial interdependence, dependence in sampling probabilities, correlated error terms, andaggregation biases. They are better at pointing out the problems than at suggesting solutions, butin a volume dedicated to ethereal considerations of social theory, this frank, grounded side-tripinto the numerology of quantitative crime research is refreshing and noteworthy. Geis's chronology of the demise of the Criminology School at Berkeley is at once gripping story-telling and shocking stuff. He describes the way the political activity of faculty at Berkeleybecame linked to the electoral politics in California and led eventually to the dismantlement ofthe School. By naming names, he gives substance to a distressing violation of academicfreedom. The story -- which he admits may be disputed in some of its particulars by personsnamed in his story -- puts us all on notice as to the ease with which circumstances can conspireto overcome precious freedoms of the academy. Scholars can use being reminded of this fact,and students will be the wiser for knowing the tale. What binds this varied collection together is its thematic interest in social control contradictions:policies devised as ways to protect the rights of individuals or communities result in their furthersubservience to the state; new programs conceived as alternatives to formal social controlsucceed in strengthening the apparatus of control; interventions developed to prevent crimebecome institutionalized despite their proven insignificance in this regard; crime measuresdesigned to inform us inevitably reinforce biased understandings of crime and social control; theexercise of freedom contains the kernels of its own demise. We are reminded that the study of social control systems is largely a meditation on the socio-political functions of contradiction. This is an important, enduring lesson, one ably brought tobear by these worthy advocates and scientists. My only quibble is a nagging concern about the audience of such a volume. In the advertisingnotes, Professor Emeritus James Short (current President of the American Society ofCriminology) says the book should be on the bookshelf of every politician and indeed everycitizen. I am left to wonder, "Why?" For one thing, the language in most of the selections istechnical, jargonistic, or both, with special usages of ordinary terms such as "modern" or"narrative," and the recurrent reliance on in-group terms such as Page 64 follows: "representation, "penality," and "discourse." Our penchant to speak in tongues to one anothertends to create a side-show to the main event going on around us, and it ensures that any lessonswe believe we may have to impart will remain closely guarded, as though a type of inviolablewealth to be hoarded. It is also convenient. The fact that our unremitting criticism of the actions of the world cannever make it into the action and language of the world protects us from accountability. Socialcontrol becomes something "they" do and "we" remark upon. So as much as I liked this volume,I am also tempted to wonder why it was necessary and whom it helped. Aside from the fact that Sheldon L. Messinger deserves so richly these accolades.

Bodie. Westport, CT: Praeger, 1995. 128 pp. Cloth $45.00. Reviewed by Donald Jackson, Department of Political Science, Texas ChristianUniversity. This is a short book with a somewhat misleading title. It is not about thepolitics, judicial otherwise, that may have been involved in influencingthe judges of the International Court of Justice to adopt a more activiststance. Instead, it is about the evolution of the distinction in publicinternational law between "legal" issues and "political issues".The actual book is of much less interest to political scientists than theone suggested by the title might have been. Bodie identifies his purpose in writing the book by asking the followingquestion: "Is there subject matter in international discourse overwhich international law does not rule? In other words may internationalrelations be divided into legal and non-legal realms?"(1). Fair enough,but the conceptualization of the distinction between the two realms in internationallaw traditionally has characterized some issues as political and othersas legal, and that usage is not likely to be of much interest to politicalscientists, except perhaps as a form of decisional behavior to be explained.It should also be noted that the legal/political distinction is not thesame as distinction between political questions and constitutional questionscontained in decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. What has the distinctionmeant to public international lawyers? An early try (in 1758) distinguished between "essential rights"and "less important rights"(7). In some understandings of thedistinction, essential rights were not within the legal realm because theyinvolved the fundamental security of the state and could be settled onlyby a test of strength, i.e., war, rather than law. Clearly any understandingthat merely claims "less important rights" for adjudication islikely to be unsatisfactory in the long run. Another understanding of thedistinction involved the position that a political issue becomes a legalissue only when there is a mutual willingness of the contending states torely on arbitration or adjudication, or when all the parties agree thatthe correct answer is provided by established rules of international law-- another outcome unlikely to satisfactory to international public lawyersin the long run. According to Bodie, one long-standing conflict in public international lawhas been between the "realists" and the "idealists".Realists tend to be more skeptical about the capacity of international lawto resolve disputes, while idealists have a normative preference for expandingthe ambit of international law. In this context Bodie summarizes the characterizationof these disputants by Hans Morgenthau, "[W]hereas the idealist believesin abstract principles and attempts to reeducate people to be better, therealist sees the world and its inhabitants for what they really are andformulates policies that will work with those forces, not against them "(17).Both, however, must recognize that states sometimes do use force ratherthan law to achieve their ends. Thus the more general point is the obviousone that, since national interest and international law may sometimes bein conflict, the vital question is how to secure the jurisdiction of an Page 167 follows: international tribunal when it usually is not coercive, as it ordinarilywould be within an nation state. A subsequent chapter reviews the history of the submission of nations tointernational arbitration, as in the dispute between the United States andGreat Britain over the ship Alabama following the American Civil War. Ofcourse arbitrations usually occur by consent rather than by compulsory jurisdiction,so they represent only a small step forward for international law. It isonly in Chapters 3 and 4 that Bodie examines the experiences of the PermanentCourt of International Justice under the Covenant of the League of Nationsand of the International Court of Justice under the Charter of the UnitedNations with the aim of examining how assertive they have been in claimingjurisdiction for international law over international disputes. He findsthat the Permanent Court of International Justice, while perhaps not activistoverall, did not always avoid cases because of their "political context,"although most of the cases did not involve the sort of issues that statesgo to war over (55). However, more serious conflicts reached the InternationalCourt of Justice. The core of Bodie's book is contained in his review of the work of the InternationalCourt of Justice in the post World War II era, for Americans most notablyin two cases involving the United States, the taking of American diplomaticand consular staff as hostages in Tehran in 1979 and the case brought byNicaragua resulting in a judgment in 1986 holding that the United Stateshad violated its obligations under customary international law through itssupport of the "Contras". Bodie applauds the willingness of theInternational Court of Justice to take the "idealistic" positionthat international law in principle ought to be applicable to any internationaldispute: "Another way of saying this is that regardless of the approachtaken interpretation-wise, restrictive or expansive, the Courts (the PCIJand the ICJ) have never been faced with subject matter that is incapableof legal resolution" (89). The fact that international courts may not have the resources -- even withthe aid of allied international institutions -- to enforce their decisionwhen voluntary compliance is not forthcoming doesn't seem to bother Bodiemuch. In his view a non-complying South Africa or a non-complying UnitedStates are more tarnished by the moral judgment of international law thanis a court that is incapable, in the end, of enforcing its decisions (95).Some might find it easy to disagree with that evaluation. Bodie does a decent job at what he seeks to accomplish, and he certainlyis not verbose, but this book will be more of interest to professors oflaw than to political scientists. It might serve as a supplemental readingfor an undergraduate course in international law, although I suspect thatsuch courses are rarely taught within political science departments thesedays.

Bogart. Toronto, New York and London: Oxford UniversityPress, 1994. 334pp. Paper. Reviewed by Roy B. Flemming, Department of Political Science, Texas A&MUniversity In 1982 a natural experiment in legal change began in Canada when PrimeMinister Pierre Trudeau, pursuing both personal and political aims, succeededin appending a Charter of Rights and Freedoms to Canada's patriated constitution.The British North American Act of 1867, which established Confederation,dealt primarily with the division of powers between the country's federaland provincial governments. The Charter transformed this "governments'constitution" into a "people's constitution" (Cairns 1991).Within a decade the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, according to Russell(1992, 35), had become "a major factor in Canadian public life"and while the media and academic journals were soon "stuffed with Charterchatter," much of it approving, acclaim for the Charter has never beenuniversal. Many politicians and academics greeted it with caution, ambivalence, ordenunciation. As experience with the Charter and research of its effectshave accumulated, the number of "Charter skeptics" (Knopff andMorton 1992) drawn from both the political right and left appears to havegrown. With COURTS AND COUNTRY, W. A. Bogart, a law professor at the Universityof Windsor, joins the ranks of these skeptics. After a sweeping survey oflitigation and the role of the judiciary in Canada, Bogart concludes theCharter was a "mistake." In reaching this conclusion, Bogart pullstogether the objections of the right that the Charter threatens to strengthenthe role of judicial review at the expense of representative governmentwith accusations from the left that the Charter will fail to meet the aspirationsfor equality expressed by the disadvantaged and marginalized. Bogart's principalcontribution to the debate over the Charter is his effort to broaden thedebate's scope to include areas of the law outside the Charter's boundaries.He thus addresses the larger problem of not just the Charter's actual impactregarding social reform and the balance between parliamentary and judicialpowers but the effects that an emergent political discourse framed in termsof rights, a possibly growing reliance on litigation as a means of socialchange, and more generally the "juridicalization of politics"(Shapiro 1994) might have on the vitality of Canada's democracy. Bogart organizes his book into four parts. The first part is a chapter thatsketches in quick strokes Canada's diverse political cultures, regionaland linguistic differences, ambivalent identities as a nation and people,traditional deference to authority, and an economy in which until recentlycompetition has been muted and government involvement welcomed. The chapter'sdominant theme is that Canada's "variegated ideology" fostereda "pragmatic and empirical" politics that historically has encouragedthe accommodation and compromise required to preserve Canada's unity andwhich has been Page 21 follows: needed to attain the constitutional ends of "peace, order, and goodgovernment." This variegated ideology, mixing in unequal proportionsthe founding fragments of classical liberalism and Toryism with later elementsof social democracy, colored the content of the Charter of Rights and Freedomsso that liberalism's individualism, the dominant fragment, was mitigatedby the absence of property rights and offset by the inclusion of group rightsand affirmative remedies that reflected Canada's communitarian or collectivevalues. The Charter thus appears to have created opportunities for progressiveforces to use the courts to promote these values. No opportunity is without risk, however. Bogart fears that the Canadianjudiciary is an unreliable ally for progressive causes and that pursuinga rights strategy through the Charter may erode the communitarian seam inCanada's public philosophy that has made its politics responsive to socialdemocratic demands. He introduces his general concerns in two chapters thatmake up the second part of the book. The first chapter draws heavily fromthe American literature to underscore the problematic impacts of law reform(e.g., Handler 1978) and of high court decisions (e.g., Rosenberg 1991)in order to question popular beliefs in the power of litigation and courtsas levers for social change. The second chapter focuses on the structureof litigation, its liberal individualist underpinnings which weaken it asa platform for social or political reforms, and the spotty record of Canada'scourts and legislatures regarding expanded notions of standing, class actions,interventions, remedies, and costs that would redefine the cramped structureof the traditional model. In these chapters Bogart presents the equivalent of a Catch 22 to definethe limits of litigation in Canada. If the pursuit of progressive causesthrough the courts fails or produces little more than ambiguous or modestresults, as Bogart believes the American experience shows, then the Charterof Rights and Freedoms is a chimera and litigation a fool's errand for minoritiesand the marginalized. If, however, litigation does succeed, its price maybe pernicious for democratic politics in Canada. By turning to the courtsto resolve major issues and learning to live with an expansive judiciary,Canadians may develop a "habit of mind" that expects little ofpolitics. A Gresham's Law, Bogart seems to suggest, links litigation andpolitics in which faith in law and the courts drives out confidence in democraticparticipation, thus sapping the political will of the vitality requiredto resolve contentious issues. Bogart, in essence, takes the "neo-realist"critique which focuses on the questionable and limited benefits of litigationand combines it with "structuralist" criticisms that argue thatlitigation weakens or diverts progressive movements (McCann 1994) to createa synthesis that redefines and broadens the terms of the debate over lawand courts in Canada. The book's third and longest part provides the substance for Bogart's argument.In six chapters Bogart ranges across the legal landscape, surveying at variouspoints the judiciary's role in Canada's administrative state, the fate ofwomen's issues and abortion in the courts before and after the Charter,the Page 22 follows: debate over tort and no-fault regimes in Canada, the drift toward the dueprocess model in criminal law under the Charter, the courts' changing rolein federal relations since Confederation, and, finally, equality litigationand aboriginal rights under the Charter and whether the Charter is judicializingCanadian politics. Bogart arranges these chapters like a fugue in that eachchapter has a similar format which is then repeated in more or less contrapuntalfashion. Two contrasting models or perspectives are introduced; Canada'slocation or movement vis-a-vis the models is considered; the research andarguments about the Charter's impact or effects of court decisions are weighed;then Bogart closes the discussion by pointing to the risks of blindly acceptingthe mystique of the law, courts, and Charter. An example of this format is the chapter on criminal law. Bogart uses thedue process and crime control models to frame his discussion of how Canada'sSupreme Court through the Charter has applied the exclusionary rule withuncertain results and how the Court's ruling on delay prompted a politicaluproar when over 40,000 criminal charges were dismissed in Ontario. In wrappingup this discussion Bogart proceeds to ponder the premonitions American researchraise about the elusive effects of the Warren Court decisions and what asimilar "due process trajectory" might mean for Canadian politicsand the problems Canada's high court creates when it cloaks itself in themantle of policy maker to make broad, far-reaching decisions transcendingthe immediate issues of the cases it is deciding. The leit motif of thisthird part is that Canada's courts, unlike its legislatures, historicallyhave not been especially hospitable forums for progressive causes and thateven when the courts act favorably the success is short-lived or offsetby unanticipated consequences. In his concluding chapter and the book's fourth part, Bogart worries thatdespite this historical record Canadians, particularly the powerless andmarginalized, will be drawn to the courts by the allure of litigation andcharms of the Charter expecting to find "shelter in a forum that willrespond to their pleas." These hopes, he fears, will "stumbleover reality." In his estimation experience and research fail to showthe "courts have ever been responsible for long-lasting and effectivesocial or political change." He later postulates that "if it isthe case that the more we judicialize fundamental social and political questions,the more we enervate politics, then it is also likely that the more we limitthe judiciary, the more politics will need to respond to the discontentsthat make recourse to the courts seem so tempting or at least necessary."His solution is to shove the litigiousness genie back into a common lawbottle that confines the judiciary to the "core functions" ofcourts. If courts only make as much law as needed to resolve disputes andthis law can be changed or overturned by legislatures, the perils of substitutinglitigation for politics might be avoided. The tools for making this solution, ironically, seem at hand in the Charteritself where section 33 gives Canada's legislatures the authority to overridecourt decisions and section 1 balances rights and freedoms against the justifiablelimits of a democratic society. Section 33, however, soon fell into deepdisfavor in English-speaking Canada after Page 23 follows: Quebec used it to block a Supreme Court language decision. Efforts to restorethe section's good standing, given the extent to which rights talk has permeatedCanada's political consciousness, might be interpreted as an attack on judicialindependence, a central tenet of the new legal culture taking root in Canada.Section 1 simply creates a "Charter Two Step" in the Supreme Court'sdeliberations while failing to check the Court's interpretative leeway (Knopfand Morton 1992, 35-60). Another difficulty that is unrelated to the Charter is the contradictionbetween Bogart's urging that the traditional model of litigation be revampedto make it more inclusive and accessible, which would increase its attractivenessas a social reform strategy, and his concern that Canadians increasinglyplace problems before the courts that would be best left to the legislatures.Bogart offers additional suggestions, which echo proposals made by otherCharter skeptics (e.g., Beatty 1990), such as making the Supreme Court morerepresentative, involving Parliament in the selection of judges, and reformingCanada's Senate, but they have the appearance of being intended to promptdiscussion; they are not discussed in detail nor are they integrated intothe book's argument in convincing ways. Bogart wrote his book to caution Canadians about the dangers of broadeningand deepening the judiciary's role in settling major political questionsand of giving courts final say over constitutional matters that can onlybe overcome by constitutional amendment. It is not surprising then thatthe book has a polemical flavor. One major limitation is that Bogart didnot collect fresh information to support his argument; he offers no systematicevidence on litigation trends or on changes in political participation,two empirical phenomena relevant to his thesis, and he provides no measuresof how juridicalized Canadian discourse has become since the Charter, relyinginstead on academic opinions and anecdotes from the media. The book's foundationrests on the ground covered by the published literature, an understandablesite given the book's breadth but also one that is not entirely secure.Bogart acknowledges this problem several times in his discussion and pointsto the limited social science research in Canada dealing with such mattersas alternative dispute resolution, administrative tribunals, abortion, tort,prison litigation, and even recent court decisions involving federalism. A second limitation is the absence of any description of the institutionalfeatures of Canada's legal system and only scattered remarks about its dynamics.This becomes a problem for readers unfamiliar with the country but the largerissue for all readers is that the legal system simply becomes a "blackbox" in Bogart's analysis. Perhaps a brief example will illustratethe problem. Seats on the Supreme Court are apportioned on a regional basis(which Bogart does not mention) to reflect Canada's major political cleavage,and the justices' decisions reflect their provincial origins (Tate and Sittiwong1989). Bogart's suggestion that the bench be made more representative meanseither that this longstanding practice must be dropped thus exacerbatingregional tensions, or the new justices would continue to be selected ona regional basis but with expectations that Page 24 follows: their decisions would reflect not provincial perspectives but the interestsof their gender or ethnicity, a potential double bind for the justices anda further complication of Canada's cross-cutting cleavages. Bogart alsodoes not consider that Ottawa could apply the brakes to judicial activismand discourage Charter litigation through its appointments to the federalcourts. Bushnell's (1992) study of Canada's Supreme Court, a "captivecourt" long bound by a restraintist tradition before the Charter, isa reminder that the country's courts are very much what the governmentsof the day want to make of them. Bogart's argument, however, has a larger problem, and it has two aspects.First, his book can be read in terms of the emerging literature dealingwith "institutional choice" (Komesar 1994). Bogart turns repeatedlyto the question of whether the Charter and attitudes about litigation havetipped the balance between courts and legislatures as institutional alternativeswith the consequence that courts now deal with problems they are inherentlyincapable of solving efficiently or effectively. Aside from the need toshow that this is indeed what is happening in Canada, Bogart fails to strugglewith the problem of identifying the criteria that would define the optimalbalance between litigation and politics as ways of resolving disputes orpursuing particular societal values. It could be countered that Bogart'srecommendation that the courts return to a common law function approximatesa solution to this problem. Yet, his solution harbors a static conceptionof the relationship between courts and litigation; it begs the questionof whether and how the solution could be kept in place. It is here perhapsthat the book's polemical purpose gets in the way of its theoretical development.The second aspect of this larger problem is Bogart's pessimistic view ofrights talk and the juridicalization of Canadian political discourse. Recentstudies by McCann (1994) focusing on the movement for pay equity and byMelnick (1994) on welfare rights in the United States strongly indicatethat labeling claims as rights offers politically weak groups considerableleverage in common law settings similar to Bogart's solution where courtscannot trump legislatures. Equally important are the findings that litigationis rarely pursued to the exclusion of other political activities and thatthe two strategies can be complementary. REFERENCES: Beatty, David M. 1990.
