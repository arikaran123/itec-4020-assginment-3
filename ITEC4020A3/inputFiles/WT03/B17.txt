General Information History of ACTCM ACTCM Admissions Tuition and Fees Faculty History of ACTCM The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is a private independent graduate school founded in 1980 as a nonprofit corporation. The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is governed by a Board of Directors and the College is administered by officers appointed by the Board. The historical development of the College started in January 1981 with the entry of the first class of 34 students. Lectures were first given in the upper floor of a private residence and in May 1981, the College moved to 2400 Geary Blvd. In 1983, an adjoining building at 1303-05 Baker Street was leased to provide additional classroom and office facilities. In November 1987, the College acquired its present campus at 455 Arkansas Street in the Potrero District ofSan Francisco providing the College community with modern educational facilities. From 1981 to 1984, the College offered a two year (eight quarter) professional certificate programwhich qualified students for the profession and licensure in eleven states. In 1984 a professional degree curriculum was developed in response to the upgrading of licensure standards by the California Acupuncture Committee which sought to make the level of professional education for Chinese medicine commensurate with expansion of the scope of practice to primary health care responsibility. The new degree program is supported by carefully defined pre-professionalrequirements to insure the necessary foundation for graduate studies in Chinese medicine. Studentsnow enter the College with a baccalaureate degree that combines studies in the humanities and the sciences. On December 15, 1986, the Superintendent of Public Instruction approved the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine as a California Degree-Granting Institution.

Medicinal Garden Project Since the Winter of 1990, an ACTCM student began to develop a medicinal herb garden on the school grounds. Since that time, the Medicinal Herb Garden Project Director continues to develop the project. The garden consists mainly of Chinese medicinal plants and some important European and North American herbs are included. The garden is intended to serve as an educational tool and to provide a place wherethe general public may gain a greater awareness of Chinese medicine. Students can be assisted in learning the usage of each plant, and both students and the generalpublic alike, can gain a deeper feeling and link with the herbs. Plaques are placed in the garden containing information cards providing the Chinese and Latin names of the herbs, the "temperature" (hot or cold), the taste (bitter, sweet, bland, etc.), and the function in Chinese medicine. Having close access to the living plants that are being used at the school, is a valuable learning tool. Also, harvesting the useful parts of the plants, drying and tasting them firsthand, can be an enlightening experience that can connect one to the botanical in a special and personal way. The plants have been obtained as young plants from nurseries, botanical gardens, private individuals, and from seed. Contacts for the plants and seeds have been made from as far away as Europe, Japan, Korea, and China. In 1996 the gardens' management was assumed by the student garden project group. The garden is a work in progress. New contacts and new plants/seeds are continuously being sought out. There are plans to translate and compile information on the usage of many of the species grown here which are not yet listed in the current medical materials in English. Students are encouraged to assist the Garden Project Group and to be involvedin the project. International Visitor's Program The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine was authorized by the United States Information Service to issue IAP-66 visa authorizations for "International Visitors" from the People's Republic of China who wished to participate in the College's Exchange Visitor Program. Currently, the College is applying for a expanded scope for the Exchange Visitor Program. American College H.I.V. Clinic Program On July 1, 1992, the College entered into a contract with the San Francisco Department of Public Health AIDS Office to provide medical care to people with HIV using acupuncture and herbal medicine. Funding for this contract is provided by the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (C.A.R.E.) Act. The College formed a Community Advisory Committee to provide input and feedback in the development and implementation of the program. To facilitate this program, the College expanded clinic hours, and hired additional staff acupuncturists, including Spanish-speaking bi-cultural practitioners. The College beganoutreach and community education efforts to other AIDS service providers and increased the number of HIV+ patient visits from an estimated 65 per month to 250 per month. As a result of these efforts, the College has created a model for Chinese medicine care for people with HIV, has delivered this service to San Franciscans in need, and provided an outstanding opportunity for faculty and students to study HIV/AIDS and its impact on individuals and society. In addition, the College is developing relationships to other health care providers in the local community and around the world.

From this examination, a picture composed of individual symptoms and sign emerges, which may point to an identifiable pattern of disharmony.

Your treatment plan will be discussed with you and with your consent, treatment will proceed. Treatment The acupuncture treatment is performed by a member of the clinic medical staff or by students under his or her supervision. In the American College Community Clinic, sterile needles are used once and then disposed of . Acupuncture needles are very thin and cause little or no pain when inserted. After the needle has been inserted at the point, you may feel tingling, pressure or warmth. This simply means that the qi has arrived. There are a variety of techniques that may be combined during an acupuncture treatment. Sometimes the needles are given mild electric stimulus. Another type of treatment uses moxibustion (the burning of artemisia herb) above the skin to warm and stimulate the acupuncture points. Some practitioners use tui na, Chinese massage, to treat a variety of musculoskeletal problems. Please ask us it you have any questions about the treatments you are receiving. We want you to have the best possible experience at the Clinic. Herbs If herbs are prescribed for you, the prescription will be filled while you are in the treatment room.

Chinese medicine has the status of a primary health care modality with licensed practitioners exercising responsibility for diagnosis, treatment and the use of herbs and other non-drug substances. ACTCM Cinic provides treatment through the modalities of acupuncture and Tui Na (physiotherapy); herbal prescriptions; Qi Gong (breathing exercises); and food therapy by our licensed, experienced practitioners. The Clinic Facility includes: a reception area, 8 treatment rooms, 3 diagnostic rooms, an herbal inventory room, a records review room and a pharmacy. Community Clinic HIV Program ACTCM Community Clinic The Community Clinic exists as a teaching adjunct to the College's degree program. With an established patient population and a teaching environment the Community Clinic offers a unique resource for internships in traditional Chinese Medicine. Patient care and student instruction is under direct supervision of Staff Acupuncturists and Clinical Faculty. Visiting the Clinic After checking in at the desk, you will be given intake forms which ask about your health history. next, you will be shown to the interview room. There the attending medical staff and student assistants will ask you questions about your general physical and emotional health. You will be asked to extend your tongue -- its color and appearance are valuable in diagnosis. Your pulse will be felt to discern subtle characteristics of your condition. From this examination, a picture composed of individual symptoms and sign emerges, which may point to an identifiable pattern of disharmony. When this diagnosis has been made, the clinician will prescribe the appropriate acupuncture and herbal treatment. Other treatment modalities which may be used include tui-na (Chinese massage) and Chinese nutritional counseling. Your treatment plan will be discussed with you and with your consent, treatment will proceed. Treatment The acupuncture treatment is performed by a member of the clinic medical staff or by students under his or her supervision. In the American College Community Clinic, sterile needles are used once and then disposed of . Acupuncture needles are very thin and cause little or no pain when inserted. After the needle has been inserted at the point, you may feel tingling, pressure or warmth. This simply means that the qi has arrived. There are a variety of techniques that may be combined during an acupuncture treatment. Sometimes the needles are given mild electric stimulus. Another type of treatment uses moxibustion (the burning of artemisia herb) above the skin to warm and stimulate the acupuncture points. Some practitioners use tui na, Chinese massage, to treat a variety of musculoskeletal problems. Please ask us it you have any questions about the treatments you are receiving. We want you to have the best possible experience at the Clinic. Herbs If herbs are prescribed for you, the prescription will be filled while you are in the treatment room. These herbs are usually in dried form and must be brewed to make a tea. Occasionally your practitioner my prescribe herbal pills or powders.

HIV Program On July 1, 1992, the College entered into a contract with the San Francisco Department of Public Health AIDS Office to provide medical care to people with HIV using acupuncture and herbal medicine. Funding for this contract is provided by the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (C.A.R.E.) Act. The College formed a Community Advisory Committee to provide input and feedback in the development and implementation of the program. To facilitate this program, the College expanded clinic hours, and hired additional staff acupuncturists, including Spanish-speaking bi-cultural practitioners. The College beganoutreach and community education efforts to other AIDS service providers and increased the number of HIV+ patient visits from an estimated 65 per month to 250 per month. As a result of these efforts, the College has created a model for Chinese medicine care for people with HIV, has delivered this service to San Franciscans in need, and provided an outstanding opportunity for faculty and students to study HIV\AIDS and its impact on individuals and society. In addition, the College is developing relationships to other health care providers in the local community and around the world.

Since that time, the Medicinal Herb Garden Project Director continues to develop the project. The garden consists mainly of Chinese medicinal plants and some important European and North American herbs are included. The garden is intended to serve as an educational tool and to provide a place wherethe general public may gain a greater awareness of Chinese medicine. Students can be assisted in learning the usage of each plant, and both students and the generalpublic alike, can gain a deeper feeling and link with the herbs. Plaques are placed inthe garden containing information cards providing the Chinese and Latin names of the herbs, the "temperature" (hot or cold), the taste (bitter, sweet, bland, etc.), and the function in Chinese medicine. Having close access to the living plants that are being used at the school, is a valuable learning tool. Also, harvesting the useful parts of theplants, drying and tasting them firsthand, can be an enlightening experience that can connect one to the botanical in a special and personal way. The plants have been obtained as young plants from nurseries, botanical gardens, private individuals, and from seed. Contacts for the plants and seeds have been made from as far away as Europe, Japan, Korea, and China. The garden is a work in progress. New contacts and new plants/seeds are continuously being sought out. There are plans to translate and compile information on the usage of many of the species grown here which are not yet listed in the current medical materials in English.

What is TASC ? The objective of the international GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) Programme is "to understand ocean ecosystem dynamics and how they are influenced by physical processes so that the predictability of the population fluctuations in a changing global climate can be assessed". The aim is to promote large scale research into the effects of ocean climate change around the world. The programme of work in the north-east Atlantic presented here represents a co-ordinated European response to the GLOBEC initiative. Links with equivalent studies in the north-west Atlantic will be carried out through ICES. The objective is to understand the physical and biological processes which control the population dynamics of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, a key zooplankton species in the north-east Atlantic. Establishing the relationship between the physical and biological factors affecting annual recruitment and reproduction of the species is an essential step towards predicting the consequences of future climate change. Hypotheses developed to address the linkage between physical processes and C. finmarchicus population dynamics are: The interaction between vertical migrations and shelf edge hydrodynamics determines the ability to C. finmarchicus to seasonally colonise north-east Atlantic shelf ecosystems from overwintering depths in Norwegian Deep Water off the shelf edge. Year-to-year variations in the timing and dynamics of shelf populations are dependent on oceanic and shelf scale forcing. The deep circulation in the Norwegian Sea Basin and overflow into the north Atlantic is responsible for a "teleconnection" between C. finmarchicus summer populations in north-east Atlantic rim ecosystems. Latitudinal gradients in abiotic conditions and interactions with predators control large scale differences in overwintering behaviour. The large scale demography, life history timing and generation cycle characteristics of C. finmarchicus are related to the basic physiology of the species in relation to feeding conditions and the pattern of entry to and emergence from diapause. The project will test these hypothesis in a number of different settings around the North Atlantic Rim, in particular, off southern Iceland, the Faroe Plateau, the northern North Sea and along the Norwegian midshelf. The work programme combines laboratory and mesocosm investigations of nutrition, growth and reproductive biology with both large and small scale field studies. The accumulated knowledge will be synthesised in a range of modelling tasks and the results set in context by reference to statistical analysis of long term time series data. Three approaches will be adopted: field investigations, mesocosms and laboratory experimentation and modelling. Field investigations will include mapping the distribution and physiology of the species in relation to hydrography during the winter spring transition period. A coordinated and comparative time series field sampling programme covering one year will also be conducted at selected locations in the Norwegian Sea and bordering shelf. The above will provide insights into regional and temporal differences in the population biology of Calanus. Studies in mortality rates and behaviour at selected sites will be addressed with high temporal resolution using conventional net systems and acoustics. Mesocosms will be used to study basic growth patterns and for assessment of latitudinal differences in physiology. These systems may provide information enabling identification of environmental cues governing life cycle patterns along latitudinal clines. Laboratory activity will concentrate on establishment of cultures of the species, to enable the studies of multiple generation Calanus population dynamics in the laboratory. The controlled culture experiments will enable us to determine the influence of environmental and dietary factors on several aspects of population biology of Calanus. Several different model approaches will be applied, including hydrodynamic models encompassing both large and mesoscale processes. Sensitivity analysis will examine the scope for variability in climatological forcing at a variety of scales. Lagrangian model simulations will be run to define particle tracking routes as defined with behaviour pertinent to the various phases in the life cycle of Calanus. A bioenergetic model will be synthesized. A circle-map model of the Calanus life cycle will be developed, and will, together with particle tracking dispersal model enable us to explore population synchrony in relation to the periodicity of the forcing environmental singals.

MEETING REPORT Participants: UIT�: K. Tande UiB: D. Aksnes IMR: B. Ellertsen, F. Rey, H. Sagen, H.R. Skjoldal, S. Sundby, R. Sundt, B. �dlandsvik 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION K.Tande gave an overview of the strategic plan for 1996, as it appears in the "Technical Annex". A short overview of the achievements obtained in ICOS was given. Thereafter he presented the main conclusions from Task 1 meeting in Trondheim 13-14 April. Historical data series (subtask 1.3): Large amounts of data are held in Murmansk (PINRO), partly published by Degtereva (1979). Access to Russian data is important. F�roese data series exist from 1989, and Islandic data from 1961. CPR data on C. finmarchicus exists from the last 40 years, access to the data depends on funding. Cross shelf dispersal (subtask 1.5): There is a need to connect the IMR subtask 2.5 with subtask 1.5 of IfM especially with regard to area to be investigated. Field activities: TASK 1 and 2 must be integrated with respect to field activities. Protocols for standardization of methods must be produced. It was noted that the Norwegian research community is lacking appropriate equipement in order to study mesoscale phenomena pertinent to Calanus. A plan for important activities in 1996 was presented: 1) A modelling WS was suggested in Strathclyde 19-22 Aug., with participation strong participation from modellers throughout the TASC community. 2) First annual meeting for TASC was scheduled to January 1997, with C. Miller and R. Harris as co-conveners. 2. LARGE SCALE FIELD SURVEY (Subtask 2.1) IMR aim at a large field survey in the Norwegian Sea in June 1997. Since the Institute's cruise plans for 1997 are not ready pr. date, the exact area and time can not be established. However, the aim is to cover the entire Norwegian Sea (except the southernmost area), parts of the Icelandic Ocean and hopefully parts of the Greenland Sea. In the southwestern part of the area covered with IMR vessles the survey must be coordinated with the Icelandic investigations. B. Ellertsen and S. Kaartvedt will make a detailed plan for the large scale field investigation 1997. The investigation on Calanus genetics was discussed. DANA has samples from the North Sea area, these could be made available to the IMR scientists. H.R.Skjoldal and R.Sundt gave an overview over the present status with regard to IMR's investigations: Our deliverables will partly be based upon material sampled in 1994, from where we have Calanus material from most of the Norwegian Sea, parts of the Icelandic Sea and Greenland Sea. Since we until now lack material from the southernmost areas, we have not been able to go deeply into the question of north-south differences in Calanus genetics. The DANA material, or material from the Faeroese area in spring, may solve this problem. R. Sundt will contact M. Heath.Since the IMR studies on Calanus genetics are coordinated with Ann Bucklin's investigations, there is already a link between EU TASC and US in this matter. There is a need to distribute descriptions of methods and techniques used by the various institutes, that includes sampling, calibration, sample treatment etc., at all levels from temperature, salinity, chl.phyll, zooplankton subsampling etc. Such descriptions are not needed only for the large field investigations, but also with respect to the time series programme. We should aim at some kind of standardization, though not too detailed. Since the various institutes partly use different kinds of equipment, the standardization can not be too rigorous. What we should aim at is depth stratified sampling. (The ICES Zooplankton WG met in Bergen two weeks prior to the TASC meeting, they conclude that standardization at sampling level should be deemphasized, however, they suggest a standard mesh size of 200 um for mesozooplankton sampling). IMR usually uses 180 um nets, US GLOBEC 150 um. 3. CALANUS IN DIFFERENT LIGHT AND PREDATORY REGIMES (SUBTASK 2.3) D.Aksnes (UIB) gave an outline of the activity so far. Some cruises have already been carried out (since Nov 1995) in various Norwegian fjords showing different predator status. The status of predators and optical characteristiscs in these fjords have been mapped. Sampling of Calanus has been performed with a Multinet, their nauplii with a plankton pump, and their aim has been to investigate winter mortality in relation to Calanus behaviour and presence of predators. These investigations will continue in two of the fjords (Lurefjorden and S�rfjorden) until autumn, minimum once a month. The predator status is quite opposite in these two sites. There is also a pronounced difference in size and behaviour of the Calanus in these fjords. Calanus in different light regimes will be investigated at two transects in the Norwegian Sea, one transects in the northern part, one in southern part in the summer period. Skjoldal suggested that these investigations partly could be combined with IMR's fishery investigations, by a combined survey with UIB's reseach vessel �H�kon Mosby� and the IMR vessels. In that case Kaartvedt must communicate their plans within May to B.Ellertsen who will try toincorporate these in the IMR cruise schedule 1997. The final plans for the IMR fishery surveys 1997 are not yet ready, the sampling within subtask 2.1 should probably take place during these surveys. Since TASC is closely connected to other IMR zooplankton investigations (theprogramme �Mare Cognitum�) synergy will hopefully be gained with respect to the laboratory treatment of samples. Working zooplankton samples in the laboratory is a crucial bottleneck, K.Tande gave an overview of his cooperation with Russian scientists in this matter. Four scientists in Moscow are engaged in working zooplankton samples. The quality of their work is good, and K.Tande suggested that we extend this arrangement. 4. COMPARATIVE TIME SERIES PROGRAMME IN 1997 (SUBTASK 2.2) Weather ship M(ike) will be operating in the Norwegian Sea at least ultimo 1999. The owner has been informed that IMR and TASC might be interested in expanding the present cooperation. F. Rey informed about the ship; there is a series of cabins for accomodation, however, no laboratory. F. Rey has used the ship for several years, and in the period April-June 1991 zooplankton samples were taken daily. Samples from every 4th day have been looked into (samples and data are available for those interested). F. Rey is currently running a phytoplankton project, in cooperation with Prof. M. Mork, UIB, at station �M�. B.Ellertsen, F.Rey and M. Johannessen (IMR) will look into the logistics; equipment, accomodation, lab.containers, cooling facilities etc., in early May, and provide information to S. Kaartvedt for further distribution. According to S. Kaartvedt, H.-J.Hirche and his group is interested in taking part in the sampling at station �M� in 1997. Lofoten S.Skreslet (NOC) will be responsible for a frequent sampling in the Lofoten. According to K.Tande the plans for this sampling are already settled, and will be made available to S. Kaartvedt. Drilling platforms at M�re-Helgeland K Tande informed that M.Heath plans sampling from oil rigs in the North Sea, using a modified WP-2 net. According to H.R.Skjoldal IMR earlier has used platform supply ships for weekly sampling. No descicions were made with regard to expanding the existing sampling programme to oil platforms, fixed oceanographic stations along the Norwegian coast etc., and the conclusion was that new ideas with regard to sampling within the �time series programme� should be communicated to B. Ellertsen and S. Kaartvedt for further evaluation. Less frequent sampling (2-10 weeks interval): Svin�y- and Gims�y transects.(Note that in �Technical annex� there is a printing error; �Fulg�ysnittet� instead of �Gims�ysnittet�). B.Ellertsen informed about the present sampling programme at these transects. Samples (up to about 20 stations per transect) are taken with varying time intervals, 0.5-2 times a month. The aim has been to cover at least the Svin�y transect twice a month, however, due to lack of ship time sampling has not been as regularly as planned. For the year 1997 the sampling plan for these sections must be fixed already in early autumn 1996. At present sampling takes place using a WP-2 net at all stations, additionally MOCNESS-trawl at 3-5 stations per transect. Increasing the number of MOCNESS stations brings about capacity problems with regard to further handling of samples. Within the �time series programme� there is a need for a detailed discussion with regard to cooperation, methods, etc., there is also a need to coordinate the investigations with US. Globec. S. Kaartvedt has been asked to be responsible for coordinating this part of the EU TASC and US Globec. 5. LARGE SCALE MODELLING (SUBTASK 2.5) B. �dlandsvik gave an overview of the present status with regard to modelling. G. Eriksrud will work together with B. �dlandsvik, they cooperate with D.Slagstad (SINTEF). At present they have a modell based upon two scenarios, one year with low, the other year with high inflow into the Norwegian Sea. Slagstad will use these models as a basis for his plankton drift model. �dlandsvik plans to extent this two years into 5-6 yars, also including a cold and a warm years. The model includes the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea, using a climatology produced in cooperation with DNMI (Norwegian Meteorological Institute). The grid is 20 km.Slagstad's model for the shelf area has a finer grid, 4 km. Combining the IMR and SINTEF models should be an easy task. Combining the IfM model is a challenge, since this model has some problems in the border area towards Iceland, they will also loose parts of the North Sea if they want to include the Lofotens in their 14-grid model. K.Tande underlined that there is a great need to exchange information and enhance cooperation between IMR, SINTEF and IfM on this issue. The conclusion from the model discussion is that B.�dlandsvik will participate in the modelling WS, in advance he will communicate with Dagmar Heinbucker. K.Tande will ensure that this will be an item for discussion at the workshop. As �dlandsvik planned to extend their model to include several years, B. Ellertsen informed about an interesting data set that is available from Lofoten 1987. This year several transects (8-10) across the Vestfjord was visited frequently in the period February-end April. Sampling for copepod naupli and copepods was performed with nets, data are available on numbers of Calanus, stages, lengths, etc., environmental data as salinity, temperature, nutrients etc. also exist.The preliminary investigation of the data shows an inflow of Calanus into the Vestfjord. This data set could be made available for modelling, especially by Slagstad. 6. DATA MANAGEMENT (SUBTASK 2.4) Data management is a very important part of the IMR TASC, and K.Tande wanted a thorough discussion on this subject. �Review of the objectives and the methodology used as specifiec in the Code of Data Management in the Mast-III Projects�, as given in the agenda, was notdiscussed, since H. Loeng was not present at the meeting. It is assumed that this matter is taken care of, in the very near future, and Harald Loeng will be in charge for this subtask. Environmental data/zooplankton Both with regard to environmental data and zooplankton data there is a need to establish commom standards. Environmental data includes salinity, ADCP, temperature, fluorescence, chl.ph.-a,, and the standardization must include calibration and data management. With regard to Calanus we must agree on how to present data, f.i. numbers per m3 per stage etc. IMR will, iun the very near future, distribute a protocole presenting the IMR quality control routines. Databank for zooplankton data H. Sagen informed about the existing databases at IMR. There is a HELIX database for zooplankton only, and an INGRESS research database, which will include alle data, both environment, plankton and fish. According to Sagen establishing another TASC database will be an easy task, based upon what we already have at IMR. There is of course a challenge to make this operative for all partners while the TASC project is in progress. It should be possible to use the same software as used by JGOFS/US GLOBEC to distribute data on Internet, if we choose such a solution. For safety reasons the IMR database at present is located inside a �fire wall� and thereby unaccessible without a special safety data access card. We discussed the location of a TASC database, and found that locating this outside this �fire wall� might be the best solution. The data within the US GLOBEC are quite open to everbody, within EU projectsthere is also general lines as to the accessibility of data. K.Tande felt that in EU-TASC the accessibility of data should follow the directions used within US GLOBEC. ICES probably want the data to be stored on a format that is convenient for the ICES community. H. Loeng will act as the IMR coordinator towards ICES. A brief version in English of the IMR data base description is planned within May 15. This document have been compiled by Bjornar Ellertsen, and prepared for the webside by K.Tande.

He identified the modelling aspects of the project as being a focus for coordination in the first year since a) experience from other projects indicates that this is an area which must be carefully organised early in the project, and b) it was the least well specified part of the project in the technical annex. A general project meeting is planned for the end of 1996. The time series sampling programme in Task 2 is also not yet very well defined. S.Kaartvet (Oslo) will coordinate the development of this programme. A meeting would be held in Bergen during 15-17 April to discuss the programmes in Task 2, their coordination with the field work in Task 1, and the establishment of the database programme. From the beginning of September a project Secretary would be employed in Troms� OVERVIEW OF THE OUTCOME OF ICOS M.Heath gave an overview of the progress made during the ICOS project. Briefly, various models of the space/time variability in CPR data on Calanus species in the northern North Sea, Norway, F�roes, west of Scotland area have been developed and compare well with the results of field surveys carried out in the spring. It is clear that Calanus finmarchicus invades the North Sea from the north along the western side of the Norwegian Trench. Field surveys in the winter have explored in detail the deep water distribution of diapause C.finmarchicus in the F�roe-Shetland Channel area, and the emergence from deep water in the spring. A good understanding of the space/time dynamics of this process is now available. This has been embodied in a particle tracking model, driven by flowfield results from a nested pair of hydrodynamic models. The outer model encompasses the whole north Atlantic and Norewgian Basin at a resolution of approximately 30km. The Inner model covers the core area of interest in ICOS (North Sea, F�roe Plateau and south western Norway) to a resolution of 14km. Partial validation of the flowfield in the F�roe-Shetland Channel from CTD and ADCP data has been carried out. Results from the particle tracking models clearly show the highly restricted nature of the overwinter sources of particles simulating the migration of Calanus which successfully enter the North Sea. Particles entering the northern North Sea have a source distribution which corresponds in part to that of overwintering C.finmarchicus in the field, whilst those entering the northwestern North Sea through the Fair Isle Channel have a source distribution more closely resembling that of C.helgolandicus. The final phase of ICOS will be to test the particle invasion success to climatic scenarios simulated by the hydrodynamic models, and relate the variations to long term trends in Calanus derived from analysis of CPR data. HISTORICAL DATA ANALYSIS (subtask 1.3) Potential providers of data gave an overview of what was available at their institutions. Russian data held in Murmansk (presented by K.Tande) The data are summarized in a paper by Degterev, 1979. (The work was translated by Dr Sergei Timofeev at the USSR Academy of Sciences, Murmansk Marine Biological Institute). Data maybe available for the abundance of Calanus (ind. m-3) in the surface layers (0-50m) in the time-periods every year (April-May; June-July). Data are given (Degterev, 1979) as means for each of 5 transects. In each there are 10-20 separate observations/stations but the values for these are not reported separately. Transects cover the distance from the Norwegian Coast to Bear Island and from Lofoten to Murmansk. There are also data for ova, nauplii and copepodite stages of Calanus finmarchicus for the same time-periods and conditions. Data are long-term (30 years) NB. Degtereva, 1979 only 18 years. Degtereva data goes from 1957 to 1977. The taxonomic resolution of these data maybe rather poor but we do not yet know. Raw data rather than aggregations from Degtereva (1979) would be more useful. Temperature and some flow data maybe available and a relationship between warm years and cold years has been noticed (literature?). Problems of obtaining this information would be small relative to the potential use of the data. Can the Russians visit any of the partners? Better to go to Russia first and investigate the quality (particularly taxonomic resolution) of the data prior to investing time/money bringing Russian scientists to UK etc. E.McKenzie offered to visit Murmansk in the near future. There are no other data available for that far North. We must have the Russian data. A.Gislason mentioned that a Russian Research Vessel visits Iceland every year during a large survey of the Norwegian Sea. They also look at the hydrography of the area and these cruises have been happening for decades. Why do we not know about them? This data sounds very valuable. Is it possible to get the data and have they been published? Some PLAN is needed to go about obtaining these data. E. McKenzie and K. Tande offered to investigate. F�roese data (E.Gaard) Plankton sampling began in 1989. Data are resolved into copepodite stages. Biomass data are also available. Data were collected along 3 standard transects and there are typically 4 cruises each year in February, May, August and November. Three different water masses are sampled: (1) the North Atlantic Current dominated by C. finmarchicus; (2) the East Atlantic Current also dominated by C.finmarchicus and (3) the coastal/neritic seas on the shelf. Data are valuable for validating CPR models. F�roese also have good CTD data available to TASC. Data are availabe in digital form. Format not known but this is irrelevant. Icelandic data (A.Gislason)Since 1961 the Marine Research Institute, Skulgata has been doing spring surveys all around Iceland. Surveys began in the seas north of Iceland but were extended to the south. Data are collected at around 90 stations along 9 transects radiating from the Icelandic coast: 5 are in the north and 4 are in the south. Cruises are annual and take place during May and June. There is warm North Atlantic Current (NAC) data south of Iceland and colder water in the north where there is also a variable input of warm NAC. Interesting relationships here. Data are collected by vertical plankton net hauls (0-50m). Biomass estimates are made using displacement and stage distribution per sample is ascertained with "short-cut" method. Zooplankton scientists at MRI have published some papers based on data collected during these surveys and Astthor has aggreed to circulate them to other partners. Possibility of some confusion between C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus north of Iceland. Relative importance of biomass of C. finmarchicus could be estimated from the data. Astthor would like to investigate the importance of offshore vs. inshore spawning. For each sample, the first 100 animals of a randomly selected subsample are staged, sexed and identified. Species nos. are then converted to species biomass composition. (NB. This is also the case for the F�roese data.) Hydrographic data and chlorophyll data are also available. It will be necessary to convert data to species absolute abundance. Astthor has begun to get the data digitized and they will be available on EXCEL files. There is no ADCP data but temperature and salinity data are available and have been stored with ICES. SU will consider assembling the hydrographic data. Variability in zooplankton abundance is weakly linked to fish stocks and Astthor is trying to pin-point these connections. Again worried about contamination. Samples could be examined again in more detail as they still exist physically. NB. C.glacialis is not common and C. helgolandicus is almost certainly not there, cf. CPR records.

Variations in zooplankton densities in Icelandic waters in spring during the years 1961-1982. Rit Fiskideilar, 7(2):73-113. Continuous Plankton Recorded Survey data (Ben Planque) CPR recorder and protocol was described. Mesh-size used is 290. C. finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus were only separated post-1957. Small aperture of the entrance of the recorder vs. large exit port limit the effect of clogging on the performance of the recorder. Routes and data-coverage in space and time are highly variable. A sample is analyzed every 20 miles. Calanus CV and adults are combined into one class in the survey. Data are recorded as "recorded values". Numbers of samples in the North Atlantic are quite high. How are species in the CPR survey discriminated? Each species is examined individually. Each is picked out from the silk strip and examined separately under the microscope. E. McKenzie thanked the "data-providers" because the information has been very forthcoming. Where do we want to focus our efforts? Spring is very important. Can we convert Iceland, F�roese, pre-ICOS and ICOS cruise data and Russian data into CPR recorded values and produce pictures using all these data combined?. How much will the data cost? and can we get all the data right up to the coast of N. America? E. McKenzie has already agreed to a limit with Chris Reid just west of Iceland. E. McKenzie will have to go back to the CPR and get more data. Focus must be on Calanus finmarchicus. SUMMARY Russia Iceland F�roes CPR Spatial coverage 5 standard transects from Norwegian coast to Bear Island and from Lofoten to Murmansk. 10-20 observations along each transect. 9 standard transects radiating from Icelandic coast. Around 90 stations. 3 standard sections radiating north (14 stations), west (14 stations) and east (8 stations). Since 1994 a 4th has been done from S. F�roes to Fair Isle. Data from some heavily sampled (every 20 miles) tow-route available S. of the F�roes, S. of Iceland with some west of Greenland. Temporal coverage 1959-1977 1961-present 1989-present 1958-1995 Taxonomic resolution Maybe poor Maybe contamination by C. glacialis. No C. helgolandicus. Reliable Reliable? (Need to explain the presence of C. hel. in CPR data south of Iceland) Stage resolution Population divided into ova, nauplii and copepod stages for certain transects. Sexes? Information available on stage composition and sexes. All adults sexed and copepodite stages resolved; but only the largest naupliar stages are recorded. CV and CVI are lumped. No animals sexed. Availability of hydrographic data Possibly available available available NA CROSS SHELF DISPERSAL MODELLING (subtask 1.5) a) PARTICLE TRACKING Preliminary areas of interest: Iceland-Scotland Ridge Northwestern Norway South-eastern Iceland Northern North sea Background to work other than that described for ICOS Onshelf-offshelf Eulerian Calanus Model (D.Slagstad): The model is an advection-diffusion system based on a fixed Eulerian grid in which Calanus stage abundance is a state variable, and is driven by Eulerian data from a hydrodynamic model. The model has been used for northern Norway and was originally designed for the Barents Sea. The animals were placed deep offshore and were shown to enter the shelf at points where deep trenches cross the shelf break. The model was connected to a phytoplankton model which empirically drove the timing of egg production. From the model results, the area adjacent to the Barents Sea appeared to be a potentially very important overwintering area, although there are no field data to validate this. These animals would be transported into the Barents Sea. There seems to be a connection between production in Norwegian Shelf areas and the Barents Sea. The Barents Sea seems to be seeded west of Norway. Objectives of the particle tracking work in TASC a) Geographical Objectives Target shelf areas in TASC , governed by the availability of data on Calanus distribution, and corresponding potential overwintering areas are as follows: Target shelf area Potential overwintering area Norwegian Shelf between Bergen and Lofoten: Data available from CPR, survey data from IMR, and TASC cruises. Eastern margin of the Norwegian Sea, both north and south of Lofoten; F�roe-Shetland Channel. South and southwest Iceland: Good data are available from all around Iceland, and C.finmarchicus seems to be widely distributed. In terms of total plankton biomass, northern and eastern areas are likely to be influenced by Metridia and C.hyperboreus. After some deliberation, it was decided that it would be necessary to define target areas around most of Iceland. Southern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge. Are there any overwintering Calanus in the overflow plume from the F�roe Bank Channel?. Could such a source supply the south coast of Iceland?Open Atlantic south of Iceland, in particular the Labrador Sea water mass. We do not know whether there are any overwintering Calanus in this area, but if there are then could they colonise the south Iceland shelf?.Northern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge and southwestern Norwegian Sea. Do these areas supply the eastern or southern Iceland shelf.?Denmark Strait, west of Iceland. Is this an overwintering area, and if so, which part of the Iceland shelf could be colonised from this area? F�roe Plateau: Data available from CPR and from F�roese field surveys and from TASC cruises. The highest Calanus concentrations in spring around the F�roe Islands occur to the north and west of the islands. However, Calanus is distributed all around the F�roe shelf. Calanus nauplii are likely to be transported around the north of the F�roes to the eastern F�roese shelf, after hatching in the north or northwest. F�roe-Shetland Channel and F�roe Bank Channel probably supplies the F�roe plateau.Southern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge. Are there any overwintering Calanus in the overflow plume from the F�roe Bank Channel?. Could such a source supply the F�roe Plateau?Open northeast Atlantic, in particular the area between Rockall Bank and F�roe Bank. Are there any overwintering Calanus in this area? If so, then they could contribute to the F�roe Plateau population.Northern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge and southern Norwegian Sea. Do these areas supply the F�roe Plateau? Northern North Sea: Data as in ICOS, and from first TASC cruise. F�roe-Shetland Channel source well defined from ICOS.Open northeast Atlantic, in particular the area between Rockall Bank and F�roe Bank. Are there any overwintering Calanus in this area? If so, then they could contribute to the northern North Sea. This is the major unknown factor emerging from ICOS. b) HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING In TASC, IfM will develop three hydrodynmaic models. As in ICOS, the requirements of particle tracking will be met by a nested pair of fixed level models, the coarse outer model providing boundary data for the finer inner model covering the main area of interest. The third type of model will be a layer model, in which the layers represent water masses rather than fixed depths. This will be used to model the overflow of water across the Iceland-Scotland Ridge. a) Large-scale level model: The large-scale model in ICOS was vertically-integrated. This model will be vertically-resolved in TASC. The vertical resolution of the model has not been decided yet, but the number of layers will be minimised (probably to 3, although more might be needed). If necessary, ice formation at high latitudes (west coast of Greenland) will have to be taken into account explicitly. b) Medium-scale level model: This will cover a similar area to that in ICOS (Iceland-Norway), but at a finer resolution (7.5' (lat.) and 15' (lon.)). The finer resolution is necessary to better resolve the F�roe Bank Channel. This model does not fit very well the new intended source areas, which are in any case very close to the model boundaries. It might not be possible to extend the model westwards towards Greenland because of the prohibitively large number of extra grid nodes involved. It is not possible to sacrifice model areas to the south in order to give extra coverage to the north because of the absolute necessity to include the North Sea which has a large influence on the shelf edge flow west of Norway. Therefore, it will probably be necessary to use coarse model data for particle tracking close to Greenland and allow particle to move between coarse and medium scale model grids. c) Layered model: The layers are not fixed in this model, but follow each water mass. A preliminary version of this model has already been developed in connection with another project, and it will be applied to the Iceland-Scotland Ridge overflow in TASC. In TASC, a climatological mean annual cycle will be modelled, thus providing a time-dependent flowfield. Anomalous situations can also be simulated with a time-dependent flowfield. This modelling work is very dependent on the atmospheric data set, which will not be available until July. Additional freshwater input data are also desperately needed for west of Norway and for the UK and Ireland. c) SOURCE AREAS AND METHODS OF STUDY (A) Norwegian shelf The sources of overwintering animals which invade the Norwegian mid- shelf could be the F�roe-Shetland Channel, the eastern Norwegian Sea, and/or west of Lofoten. Overwinter distribution will be derived from Task 2 (large scale surveys), whilst the routes and timing of invasion will be determined from field surveys and particle tracking. (B) Iceland (east) Is the source of the spring distribution of animals located to the north or the south? Sampling and particle tracking will be used to answer this question. (west) Sampling of the distribution of Calanus can be carried out. Particle tracking experiments could only be done if the appropriate flowfield data are available. (C) F�roes Possible sources are F�roe Bank Channel and/or the Norwegian Sea. This could be resolved with the use of particle tracking. (D) North Sea The role of the open northeast Atlantic as an overwintering area for animals invading the North Sea is unresolved, and should be addressed in TASC. In all, there are 9 possible sources, two of which will be difficult to explore due to the proposed coverage of the medium scale hydrodynamic model. It seems to be very difficult to design a single medium scale hydrodynamic model which will cover all these sources to adequate resolution. In discussion it was noted that in fact it was the need to resolve the F�roe Bank Channel which placed the main constraint on the model. It was therefore suggested that variable spatial resolution might be a way forward - with fine resolution in those areas that demand it, and coarser elsewhere, thereby allowing the overall model area to be increased without detriment to the number of wet grid nodes (which determined the computational demand). However it seems that this could cause additional problems such as "reflections" (equivalent to "internal boundaries"). Another possibility might be to improve the vertical resolution of the large-scale model, mainly in the shallower layers, in the critical areas of interest FIELD PROGRAMMES (Subtask 1.1, 1.2, 1.4) S.Jonasdottir presented the main results from the first DIFRES/MLA cruise under subtask 1.1 which was carried out 12-29 March 1996. The main objectives were to determine the distribution, development, physiological state and production of C. finmarchicus in relation to oceanographic features and primary production in the northern North Sea, along the southern coast of Norway and at the F�roe Plateau.Calanus finmarchicus was mainly confined to the surface waters of the northeastern North Sea and the deep waters in the F�roe-Shetland Channel. Off the shelf edge it was observed ascending to the surface. Higher phytoplankton biomass values were observed in the Norwegian Coastal Current. This was also the area of highest egg production rates of C. finmarchicus. There was good correlation between chlorophyll biomass and C. finmarchicus egg production. The following table of planned surveys was assembled during the meeting: Dates Sub-task Partners Survey area 18 Nov -19 Dec 1996 1.1 MLA/DIFRES Potential overwintering areas northeast Atlantic/southern Norwegian Sea; overflow across Iceland Scotland Ridge and F�roe Bank Channel 25 Nov - 5 Dec 1996 1.2 MRI Two transects south and west of Iceland 10d Feb 1997 1.2 MRI Two transects south and west of Iceland 15d April 1997 1.4 UIT� Norwegian shelf M�re to Lofoten 7d March 1997 1.1 FLF F�roe Plateau 15-30 March 1997 1.1 MLA/DIFRES F�roe - south and southwest Iceland 10d April 1997 1.2 MRI Two transects south and west of Iceland 15d May 1997 1.4 UIT� Norwegian shelf M�re to Lofoten 30d June 1997 1.4 UIT� Norwegian shelf M�re to Lofoten 10d June/July 1997 1.2 MRI Two transects south and west of Iceland There was general support for trying to standardize the sampling and the sample analysis within TASC as far as possible. For example it will be important that all the members of TASC use the same mesh sizes in their nets, especially when carrying out quantitative sampling. As to the taxonomic analysis, the procedures of the different labs should be intercalibrated and tested using blind samples. We should also standardize the procedures for the measurement of egg production and gut fluorescence. The methods used to estimate phytoplankton biomass and production need also to be comparable. Further, it is important to have proper quality assurance of the CTD-data. A.Gislason agreed to collate the sample protocols from the different institutes in Task 1 into one coherent document of recommended TASC-procedures. The different institutes under Task 1 (DIFRES, MLA, FLF, UIT�) will send their protocols to Iceland before Friday April 19. They will then be assembled as a basis for a TASC Methodology Protocol which will be circulated to partners in both task 1 and task 2 before Friday 26 April, for comments. K.Tande will prepare the members of task 2 for this. INTEGRATION OF DISPERSAL AND POPULATION MODELLING Four types of population models potentially in use during TASC were identified together with their associated forcing and physical setting data: Biological model Forcing data Physical setting Circle map models - probabilistic models of the phasing of spawning times in relation to periodicity in the environment Long-term time series of temperature, irradiance, food at particle locations. Particle tracking through temperature, food and irradiance fields. Empirical models - growth or egg production linked to temperature of food concentration by empiraical relationships Time series of temperature and food concentration along particle trajectories. Particle tracking through temperature and food fields. Semi-structured population models - population composition modelled as a series of weight classes (for example) Eulerian data on temperature and food at fixed nodes, or time series of temperature and food along particle trajectories. 3-dimensional advection and diffusion rates at fixed Euleroian grid nodes, or particle tracks through temperature and food fields. Fully structured population models - population composition modeleld as a matrix of age/weight or age/length classes Eulerian data on temperature and food at fixed nodes, or time series of temperature and food along particle trajectories. 3-dimensional advection and diffusion rates at fixed Eulerian grid nodes, or particle tracks through temperature and food fields. Problem areas which should be discussed at a workshop: Time and space dependent phytoplankton forcing data are essential for any biological modelling exercise. These could be dynamically modelled from hydrodynamic data, nutrients and irradiance, but this would be major undertaking and by no means certain of success. Alternative are to assemble phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll) data from historical and contemporary field sampling and either grid them directly onto a space-time matrix, or statistically model them in time and space. Sources of phytoplankton biomass data are: CPR greenness index ICES hydrographic database national institute databases TASC cruises SU agreed to investigate the aquisition of greenness index data from SAHFOS. Any Eulerian model implementations will require data on horizontal diffusion rates for each grid node (vertical diffusion, and advection terms are already available). The horizontal rates must be parameterised from the variance in velocities over a tidal cycle at each node. At present, the hydrodynamic models implemented by IfM do not include tides. This is because they have a minimal influence on the residual circulation in the area of interest. It was proposed to conduct a barotropic run of the hydrodynamic models with tides included to extract the component of circulation due solely to tides. It was noted that large (ocean) scale hydrodynamic modelling work was planned in both Task 1 and Task 2. The work in these tasks will make use of completely different model systems, but the results on the sacle of the whole Norwegian Sea basin should be comparable. It seems essential that the investigators involved in these Tasks coordinate the preparation of initial and forcing data, and agree on a common set of evaluation criteria. CLOSING COMMENTS K.Tande reminded the meeting that although all the discussion had referred to cross-shelf transport during the spring as C.finmarchicus is emerging from diapause, thre are also important quetions to be answered regarding the cross-shelf transport as the species enters diapause in the summer and autumn. C.Miller (USA) and R.Harris (UK) have requested a joint meeting of the North American and European sides of TASC. It had been proposed to hold this during the ICES Statutory Meeting in Iceland in October, but the meeting found mopre favour with the idea of combining it with the first annula general meeting of TASC at the end of the first year. Due to sea committments in subtask 1.1, this would have to be in January 1997, and ICES headquarters were proposed as a venue. A provisional data for the modelling workshop was agreed as the week commencing 19 August, and SU agreed to host the meeting at the Ross Priory conference centre on Loch Lomond, Scotland. Relevant parties from Tasks 2 and 3 would be informed of the dates by K.Tande. Mike Heath will be the organizer of terms, and provide the project with the agenda in the first half of June. K.Tande also reminded partners present at the meeting to remember to send a brief description of their institutes to him for inclusion in the WWW page on TASC, and to prepare a few slides on their subtasks for inclusion in a project presentation set. In this connection, the possibility of producing a project brochure along the lines of the ICOS brochure was discussed. This document was prepared by M. Heath. Back to Table of Contents TASC Database meeting at IMR, Bergen, June 7 1996 TASC DATABASE MEETING AT IMR, Bergen, June 7 1996 PARTICIPANTS: Arne Vidar Brekke (IMR), Bj�rnar Ellertsen (IMR), Rune Espelid (IMR), Helge Sagen (IMR), Kurt Tande (UiT�). AGENDA: 1. Status and a general overview of dbase (Tande) 2. Strategy for implementation of a system (Sagen/Brekke) 3. Quality assurance of CTD data (Sagen) 4. Detailed plan for preparing the dbase concept at the First Steering Committee meeting in August (Sagen/Brekke) CONCLUTIONS: 1. Status and a general overview of dbase. Tande reported from his recent meeting at ICES, where he got the impression that ICES expected a database which was easily accessible for the users. They also expected that WWW was incorporated in the database, and based upon their experience from ESOP a.o., ICES could assist in the set up of the database. ICES themselves are interested in CTD data only, they are not involved in managing other kinds of data within TASC, which is IMR's responsibility. TASC will have to give first priority to biological data collected within the TASC period, historical data, included CPR-data, will be dealt with at a later stage. 2. Strategy for implementation of a system. Brekke informed about the IMR database at present, where JGOFS software is being installed. As a basis for the TASC database we agreed that the data model already existing at IMR, with the necessary adjustments for zooplankton data, would be suitable for the TASC purpose. Brekke will be in touch with the partners in order to discuss to what extent there is a need to implement further data modelling in addition to what the model already cover. With regard to the technical solution for receiving data from the partners, Sagen suggested that IMR should accept the documented data in the format that the individual institutes at present could offer, and that IMR thereafter should import/convert data into the IMR database. There is a need now for IMR to know what kind of data we should expect to receive in the future, and what units will be used (i.e. pressure for depth, etc.). The IMR data group find that it is more time-saving for the TASC community as a whole that IMR convert the data they receive from the partners, instead of expecting the partners to deliver their data on a given definite format. To make data more accessible over Internet a stepwise solution was suggested: 1) TASC-data in the IMR database will be "exported" to world wide web by means of US GLOBEC software (JGOFS). Data will be presented as a static structure, sorted by cruise, date etc. Today this solution is used by several research institutions. JGOFS is sufficiently user friendly to serve all involved institutions which wants access to the TASC data. 2) To improve accessibility and applicability of the IMR TASC database, there is a need to produce a "dynamic" interface to the data base. This may be achieved in two ways: a) developing a web-based client-server software b) developing a Ingres client-server software Client-server software will make it possible to search the database, i.e. to collect data from discrete positions (areas) regardless of cruise, date etc. According to the TASC Technical Annex the partners wil send SQL packages to the IMR TASC server. This was regarded as an impractical solution. If SQL packages are to be received, SQL statements must be filtered before they enter the database. 3. Quality assurance of CTD data (Sagen)At present only quality controlled data, i.e. data produced according to IMR protocols, are implemented in the IMR database. It was decided that the TASC data in the IMR database must be of a similar quality level, and when TASC data are to be added to the database, these data need to be controlled in advance by the individual institutes. ICES, which is especially interested in CTD data, demands high quality of such data, and have their own handbook for CTD quality control. According to R.Espelid, who recently had visited ICES, ICES is also discussing an integrated data base system, and may very well end up with a database similar to the IMR's. 4. Detailed plan for preparing the dbase concept at the First Steering Committee meeting in August Sagen/Brekke will produce and distribute a note concerning the further strategy for the implementatioin of a data base system before July 1. A dbase group will be established as soon as possible, and tentative members should be M. Heath (MLA), 0. Asthorsson (MRI), UiT� (one person), DIFRES (one person), Dag Slagstad, SINTEF, G.Hopwood (ICES), H.Sagen and A.V.Brekke (IMR). Their dbase concept will be made available for circulation to the members of the steering commettee by August 5. This was compiled by Bj�rnar Ellertsen.

Backhaus and Dagmar Hainbucher Investigations within EU-project ICOS have confirmedthe three-dimensional and time dependent succession of Calanusfinmarchicus in the vicinity of the NW-European Shelf. Theobservations of ICOS also suggest that the succession is not confinedto the shelf/slope region but has a continuation towards Iceland.The topographies of the Faroe-Shetland Trough and Faroe Bank Channel,to the north of the Wyville Thomson Ridge, can be visualised asa continuously narrowing duct, or funnel. It channels the overflowof NSDW to the south of the Faroes and provides a source regionfor an injection of hibernating Calanus into the northernNorth Atlantic, south of the Greenland Scotland Ridge. The densityof the NSDW overflow water, having passed the ridge, is higherthan that of its ambient water masses. The overflow water, therefore,descends as a bottom-arrested gravity plume on the sloping topographywith only a small (ageostrophic) angle between its path and depthcontours. Water masses of this plume are discernible as far asthe Reykjanes Ridge, south of Iceland. On its way the plume meetsother overflow water which has crossed the ridge to the west ofthe Faroes. These known hydrographic features have implicationsfor the succession of Calanus finmarchicus. It is likelythat both plumes, initiated by the overflow, are transport vehiclesfor hibernating Calanus, thus providing a link betweenshelf and oceanic stock. With the ascent of Calanus, atthe end of hibernation, it leaves the overflow plume and getsdispersed within the surface circulation of the northern NorthAtlantic. Prevailing south-westerly winds cause an Ekman drifttowards the European coast whilst Calanus reproduces inthe euphotic zone. For hibernation Calanus descends intothe Norwegian Sea deep water (NSDW) and might, hence, return tothe overflow regime described above. To gain further insight intothis new branch of the Calanus succession a modelling techniquefor the simulation of gravity plumes, recently developed for thesimulation of slope-convection in high latitudes, will be appliedin TASC, in conjunction with the HAMSOM (general circulation)model and field observations. The oral contribution will be splitinto two parts: description of hypothesis and of oceanographicdata sampled during VALDIVIA cruise #160. Jan O.

Aksnes Fjords typically have a deep basin and a shallowouter threshold. Thus, the deep water may be resident during prolongedperiods, with little or no exchange with other water masses. Fjordstherefore provide excellent opportunities for studies of biologicalprocesses. The focus of this study is vertical distributionsand mortality rates of the calanoid copepod Calanus finmarchicus,in relation to invertebrate and fish predators during overwintering.We test the hypotheses that mesopelagic fishes (Maurolicusmuelleri and Benthosema glaciale) are major predatorson Calanus during overwintering, and that Calanusselects overwintering depths so that predation from mesopelagicfish is minimised. The studies were carried out in four Norwegian fjordswith varying topography, as well as different predator regimes.The two visually hunting mesopelagic fish prevail in certain depthstrata in three of the fjords, while these fish are lacking andtactile invertebrate predators prevail in one of the fjords. Mesozooplankton were sampled by vertical net hauls,while distributions of fish and large invertebrates were registeredby acoustical methods. Sound scattering layers were identifiedby trawling, and temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a concentrationand light extinction was measured. Preliminary results demonstrate marked differencesbetween the fjords. Calanus was most abundant in the fjordwithout mesopelagic fish predators, where high concentrationswere found in depth strata occupied by fish in the other fjords.

D. Bryant, M. Heath, W. Gurney, D. Beare and W.Robertson A weight structured population model is describedfor Calanus finmarchicus. Results are presented for anarea of the northern North Sea for which detailed stage successiondata exist, and are discussed in the context of other models ofzooplankton population dynamics for that area. The essential simplicityof the model enables embedding in a 3-dimensional hydrodynamicscheme representing the northern North Sea (1 degree x 1 degreeboxes, split into upper 30 m and below). Results of this spatiallyresolved model are discussed in the context of a new statisticalanalysis of C. finmarchicus late-copepodites from the ContinuousPlankton Recorder Surveys. A.D. Bryant and M.

Bucklin, S.P. Franzen, A.M. Bentley and R.S. Hill Based on the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, Calanusfinmarchicus exhibited very low levels of molecular populationgenetic variation. Both the number of mtDNA genotypes (calledhaplotypes) and the genetic divergence between haplotypes weresignificantly lower than these values for other copepod speciesassayed for the same gene. Statistical evaluation of geographicpatterns of genetic diversity revealed no evidence of significantpopulation genetic structure within the NW Atlantic. Ongoing studiesare examining these results using different molecular populationcharacters, including additional mitochondrial and nuclear genes.Our conclusion is that C. finmarchicus is transported rapidlyacross the NW Atlantic, effectively homogenizing the populationacross this region. In contrast to homogeneity within the NW Atlantic,there were significant differences between the genetic makeupof NW Atlantic populations and NE Atlantic populations, regardlessof the method of statistical analysis. The genetic divergenceof C. finmarchicus populations on either side of the NAtlantic suggests that the population dynamics, including reproductionand recruitment, may be distinct. The large-scale population genetic structure of C.finmarchicus may be investigated using a variety of geneticapproaches; the comparison of results using several genetic characteristicsis desired to ensure the validity and robustness of the result.Large-scale geographic patterns of population genetic diversityand structure may reveal the underlying population dynamics ofthe species as a whole, in terms of reproduction, recruitment,and dispersal.

Campbell, E.G. Durbin, M. Wagner, J.A. Rungeand S. Plourde Nitrogen and carbon specific growth rates and developmentrates were determined for individual stages of the copepod Calanusfinmarchicus reared at different temperatures and food concentrationsin the laboratory. Growth rates decreased with increasing stageof development. At high food levels carbon specific growth rateswere greater than nitrogen specific growth rates, while underfood limited conditions both rates were similar. Development rateswere equiproportional, but not isochronal. Naupliar stage durationswere similar, except for non-feeding stages (N1-N2) which wereof short duration, and the first feeding stage (N3) which wasprolonged, while copepodite stage durations increased with increasingstage of development. On Georges Bank during Jan-June 1995 developmentrates and carbon and nitrogen specific growth rates decreasedwith increasing stage of development as in the laboratory experiments.C5 growth rates were similar to carbon and nitrogen specific eggproduction rates of adult females. Development rates within agiven stage increased slightly as water temperatures warmed, butno relationship with chlorophyll-a concentration was observed.Carbon and nitrogen specific growth rates were more variable andshowed no significant relationships with temperature or chlorophyll-a.Addition of a mixed phytoplankton diet resulted in significantincreases in growth rates while development times were not affected.There were no differences observed in mean growth or moultingrates between different regions of the bank for C1-C4 copepodites,while rates for C5 were significantly lower on the shallow crestthan on the flank regions.

Casas Depth-stratified zooplankton samples were collectedfrom Georges Bank with a plankton pump and a 1 m2MOCNESS during 1995 as a part of the US-GLOBEC Georges Bank programme.All developmental stages of Calanus finmarchicus were enumerated.Recruitment of Calanus began in late December/early Januaryin the southern GOM with the new generation being advected ontoGeorges Bank in the region of the north-east Peak. This wintergeneration spread along the south Flank reaching maturity in lateApril and May. Abundance of nauplii in these regions of the Bankwas at a minimum during May, followed by a large second generationin June. Calanus did not appear in the central well-mixedregion of the Bank until March and then disappeared again in May.In this region of the Bank episodic wind events appeared to beresponsible for the recruitment of Calanus during the winterand high predation rates for its disappearance during the spring.On the north-east Peak and south Flank of Georges Bank the generalcirculation provides a pathway for a continuous and predictableinput of Calanus from the Gulf of Maine. E. Durbin, P. Garrahan, M. Casas: Graduate Schoolof Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, South Ferry Rd, Narragansett,RI, 02882 Visibility and predation pressure Kjetil Eiane We investigated two equally sized fjords of differentpelagic food web structure. Lurefjord is dominated by the jellyfishPeriphylla periphylla, while fish predators dominate inthe other fjord, Masfjord. Due to a slightly stronger influenceof coastal water in the Lurefjord, the light absorbance of thisfjord is two to three times higher than in other fjords. Thisresults in a reduction in light flux of several orders of magnitudeeffectively reducing the possibility of visual fish foraging.The tactile mode of predation in jellyfish, however, is not influencedand we hypothesize that the visibility regime has a decisive rolein structuring pelagic food webs.

Fiksen and F. Carlotti A copepod in a seasonal environment continuouslyface the trade off between allocating surplus growth to a storagecompartment (lipids), somatic growth or to reproduction. By buildingup lipids, it can survive periods with low food, and gain reproductivesuccess the following season by transforming fat to eggs. Also,copepods face a trade off between survival and growth, as surfacewaters generally are more risky and less productive than the darkrefuge in greater depths, both in the diel- and annual temporalscale. Implicit in these trade-offs are the numbers of generations,population dynamics and productive potential of the copepod. Wedevelop a model which find the optimal phenology and verticalmigration for a copepod (Calanus finmarchicus) in differentenvironments, using the Perron Frobenius Theorem and dynamic programming.The model predict diel- and ontogenetic vertical migration tovary with season and individual state.

We hypothesize thatGeorges Bank provides an enriched dietary environment for naupliirelative to their source regions in the adjacent Gulf of Maine.Manipulative experiments will be done to evaluate diet and measurerates of ingestion and growth. As we can't sort nauplii to speciesfrom field collections, we will use a method pioneered by RubenLasker, rear nauplii in the lab, control their growth rate withtemperature, and bring them to sea for use in experiments withnatural prey assemblages.

Themain purpose was to study the vertical distribution, conditionand population structure of overwintering Calanus finmarchicusboth on and off the shelf in relation to the physical and biologicalenvironment. The station activity involved hydrographic measurementswith a CTD, phytoplankton investigations with fluorometers andsampling for chlorophyll-a, zooplankton sampling usingdepth stratified. Multinet-tows from the bottom to the surface,gut fluorescence measurements and incubations for egg productionmeasurements. Further, acoustic measurements for the distributionand abundance of mesopelagic fishes (as potential predators onC. finmarchicus) were conducted. Astthor Gislason and Olafur S.

Head and L.R. Harris Zooplankton (>200 mm) were collected between 0-100m (spring 1994, 1996; summer 1995; fall 1996) and 0->1000 m(fall 1996) at stations on a section between Hamilton Bank (Labrador)and Cape Desolation (Greenland). In spring and summer Calanusfinmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreusaccounted for >75% of the biomass. C. finmarchicus wasalways the most abundant, reaching levels of ~10 g C m-2.C. glacialis occurred only over the Labrador and GreenlandShelves, and the biomass of C. hyperboreus was much greaterin 1996 than in 1994 in the central Labrador Sea. Lengths andweights of CV C. finmarchicus varied considerably throughoutthe sampling area, but showed no consistent variations with insitu temperature or chlorophyll concentration. A similar rangeof sizes have been observed for CV C. finmarchicus on theScotian Shelf (Halifax Line) and size may prove a marker for sourcepopulations in future studies of C. finmarchicus dynamicson the Scotian Shelf.

Heath: SOAEFD Marine Laboratory Aberdeen PO Box101, Victoria Road, Aberdeen, UK An overview of the ICOS project (EU MASTII projectCT94-0088, July 1994-June 1996) Mike Heath The ICOS project adopted a three stranded approachto investigating the life cycle of C. finmarchicus. First,the overwinter and spring distributions, demography and biologyof the species were investigated by field sampling. Second, theresults of the field programme provided some of the parametersfor a hydrodynamic and particle tracking model study. Finally,the wider area spatial, seasonal and long term variability inC. finmarchicus abundance was investigated by a detailedanalysis of Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) data. The focusof the project was an analysis of the extent to which the long-term(1955-1994) changes in the abundance of C. finmarchicusin the northern North Sea could be explained by the results ofa particle tracking model driven by regional flowfields and long-termclimatic data. The geographical focus of the project was the Faeroe-Shetlandregion, incorporating the northern North Sea, Faeroe-ShetlandChannel, southern Norwegian Sea, and neighbouring parts of thenorth-east Atlantic. The conclusion of the project was that the generalprinciples of the hypothesis proposed by Backhaus et al. (1994)are correct. Concentrations of C. finmarchicus in the shelfwaters are low during winter months, and these animals are inpoor condition. The majority of the population is found at depthsgreater than 600m beyond the shelf edge, associated with NorwegianSea Deep Water (NSDW) in the Faeroe-Shetland Channel. Invasionof the North Sea from these overwinter concentrations is possibleunder certain climatic conditions. The particle tracking model predicted that the highestconcentrations of copepods in the spring should occur in the Atlanticinflow at the northern end of the Norwegian Trench, and this wasconfirmed by field sampling and from CPR data. In addition, long-termtrends in C. finmarchicus abundance in the North Sea inspring were shown to be primarily related to north-westerly windswhich control the invasion from overwintering depths in the Faeroe-ShetlandChannel. Both the incidence of north-westerly winds and the observedspring abundance of C. finmarchicus have shown a steadydecline since 1955. A second order effect appears to be a probabledecline in the abundance of overwintering C. finmarchicusin the Faeroe-Shetland Channel associated with an unprecedenteddecline in the supply of NSDW which commenced around 1967.

This technique is suited to representingthe life-cycle characteristics of multi-stage species in a periodicallychanging environment and the underlying concepts will be explained.Rather than tracking the progress of individuals in a populationthe model follows the life-history of a lineage through successivegenerations, making it very efficient when used in simulations.Initially the model will be applied to fixed locations at variouslatitudes in the North and Norwegian Seas, although later workwill apply the model to particle tracking investigations.

The experimentswere carried out from 27 March-8 May 1996 at the Marine BiologicalField Station, Bergen, Norway. The enclosures contained each 18.5m3 of sea water.Two enclosures were stocked with C. finmarchicus naupliirepresenting the stage composition NI-NIII. Nutrients were addedto the enclosures resulting in a chlorophyll range between 3 and18 g l-1 andthe temperature increased from 4.5-7°C during the experimentalperiod. Stage duration in the cohort and carbon and lipid contentof the dominant developmental stages were measured every fourthday. During the 43 days experimental period the naupliar stagesdeveloped to CV and adult males and females were also observedat the end of the period.

Houlihan Calanus finmarchicus copepoditestage V was collected on the continental shelf north of Shetlandand across the shelf into the Faeroe-Shetland Channel on fouroccasions from December 1994 to May 1995 and in the North seain March 1996. Physiological parameters for the overwinteringand active population of animals where determined. Laboratorymeasurements of oxygen consumption of the animals were made attemperatures similar as in the field and at different temperatures(0°C, 5°C, 7°C and 10°C) to determine theeffects of temperature changes on the overwintering animals. Theeffects of food availability on metabolic responses at the timeof arousal were measured. Animals collected from the overwinteringpopulation showed very little response to changes in temperature.The active surface population in May had noticeably higher respirationrate than in any of the respiration experiments for the deep wateranimals. Slight increase was detected in respiration of fed animalsto starved. Measurements were made of dry weight and samples takenfor chemical analysis to determine the composition of the population'scarbon and nitrogen content. Due to the low respiration demands,the decrease in carbon content in diapausing CVs was very low.Carbon and Nitrogen seemed to be used up in the same proportion(approximately 10:1, respectively). Results from ongoing analysiswill be presented. A. Ingvarsdottir and M. Heath: SOAEFD Marine Laboratory,PO Box 101, Victoria Road, AB9 8DB, Aberdeen D.F.

Jónasdóttir and KatherineRichardson Lipid concentration of the copepod Calanus finmarchicuswas measured during autumn, winter and spring in the Faeroe-ShetlandChannel during the ICOS project. As stage V C. finmarchicusdirects all energy into storing wax esters (WE) before enteringdiapause in autumn, the space and time concentration of WE inCalanus stage V and females allows us to calculate theutilization rate of lipids and estimate the potential length ofdiapause and cost of maturation and ascent to the surface. Additionally,changes in lipid classes (WE and triacylglycerols) could possiblybe an indication of initial biological activity in spring. DuringTASC samples will be collected in order to further develop a modelon lipid utilization of Calanus finmarchicus during springtransition. Sigrun H.

Madden The geographical and vertical distributions of fourspecies of Calanus were investigated in May 1994 in thenorthern North Sea and to the north-west of Scotland. These speciesshowed distinct differences in their distribution in the studyarea. C. finmarchicus was the most abundant species throughoutthe area. Highest numbers were present in offshore areas of thenorthern North Sea and Faeroe-Shetland Channel. C. helgolandicuswas in contrast most common in the inshore stations. C. hyperboreuswas less abundant than the former two species and was restrictedto the most northerly transects. C. tenuicornis was onlyfound in very small numbers, to the north-west of Scotland. Juvenilestages of C. finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus predominantlyoccurred in the upper layers of the water column, where the chlorophyllconcentration was highest. The adult stages shared a similar distributionin some stations while they displayed a wider vertical distributionin other stations. The results of the study demonstrate that thedistribution of these H. Madden: SOAEFD Marine Laboratory Aberdeen PO Box101, Victoria Road, Aberdeen, UK Additive Modelling of CPR data for Calanus E. McKenzie and D. Beare The use of modern Additive Models in the analysisof raw Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) data for the two calanoidcopepods Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicuswill be described. The proponderance of zeroes in the data, aswell as the particular problems associated with the recordingprotocol are adequately handled. In the first approach to be described,data are aggregated prior to analysis into arbitrary spatial compartments(boxes) and the time-dependence is modelled as a function of long-termtrend and seasonality. In the second method, all the CPR dataavailable (56-64°N and 13°W-11°E) are consideredsimultaneously and variables of location (longitude and latitude)are incorporated as continuous random variables, rendering theuse of spatial compartments unnecessary. The approach providesnew insights of the spatio-temporal distribution of Calanusin the northern North Sea and the results of the models will bediscussed mainly in this context. E. McKenzie and D. Beare: Departmentof Statistics and Modelling Science, University of Strathclyde,UK CPR data and diel vertical migrations: statisticalconsiderations E. McKenzie and D. Beare Diel vertical migration (DVM) occurs in a great varietyof marine and freshwater zooplankton. The typical pattern is migrationfrom greater depths during the day to shallower depths duringthe night. The functional significance of this very common behaviouralpattern has been the subject of debate and a range of hypotheseshave been promulgated to explain the phenomenon. Predator avoidance,light, temperature or a need to ascend to the surface waters tofeed on more abundant phytoplankton have all been put forwardas explanatory factors. It is known that the DVM behaviour ofzooplankton can react very rapidly to short-term (seasonal) changesin environmental conditions but it is less widely accepted, however,that slow, long-term changes in variables such as predation intensityhave resulted in long-term changes in the degree of DVM behaviourin zooplankton. Quantifying the influence of DVM in data collectedby the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey is an extremelycomplicated statistical problem requiring very careful treatmentfor many reasons. The distribution of CPR data in space and timeis non-random, there are many missing values, there are many zeroesand the duration of darkness and of daylight co-varies with theseasonal cycle. We demonstrate how modern Generalized Linear Modelscan be used to overcome some of these problems. To simplify interpretation,the data are first divided into individual months and modelledas a function of long-term trend and a two-level factor for daylightand darkness. The modelling procedure reveals that the signalfrom DVM is very strong in the summer and weak in the winter.In addition, we show that DVM behaviour is independent on long-termtrend and that in general the signal is rather weak and may beignored. E. McKenzie and D. Beare: Department of Statisticsand Modelling Science, University of Strathclyde, UK Developmental progress by cohorts of Calanusfinmarchicus in the vicinity of Georges Bank, evaluatedby age-within-stage analysis based on postmoult and tooth formationfacies in mandibular gnathobases Charles B. Miller and Jennifer Crain Calanus finmarchicus copepoditesform new teeth before each moult by a morphogenetic sequence duringthe last third of the intermoult interval. Immediately after moult,for the first third of the intermoult interval, the mandibulargnathobase contains a large, readily seen hemocoele space. Thus,by examination of their mandibles, copepodites can be assignedto one of three, roughly equal phases in the moult cycle: postmoult,intermoult, or tooth formation. We have done this twice for samples(N=30) of each copepodite stage in vertically stratified net towseries (Z=3 or 4) from five stations of the US GLOBEC Broad ScaleSurvey of Georges Bank and the southern Gulf of Maine. The proportionsof jaw phases for April 1995 show: (1) that the developmentalprogress of a population cohort, a mixture of late-spawned firstand early-spawned second generation individuals, was at the samestage throughout this wide region of coastal ocean, and (2) thatthe cohort was making developmental progress throughout the 12day duration of the cruise. Proportions for April 1996 (data incomplete,more to come) show majorities at the end of the moult cycle inall stages. Tentative interpretation is that development had beenarrested at some point, presumably by food limitation, then restarted,forcing all stages to the same phase. Fifth copepodites beforeand during the rest phase retain the postmoult facies, which isthus a mark of resting status. Fractions of the stock with postmoultsignatures rise throughout the spring and early summer. Some individualscompleting development in every part of the active season areentering rest, while others mature. The division progressivelyfavours rest as the season advances, but even some July individualsmature and reproduce. The promise and problems of classificationsbased on gnathobase facies will be discussed. Charles B.

Experiments were carried out to study theeffect of starvation and food on egg production. In addition,samples from October, December, January and August were analysedto complete knowledge of the reproductive history of females.Female gonad development started during February. By the end ofMarch all females were mature. At this time the highest egg productionrate (28 eggs f-1d-1) was measured.Until May the egg production rate decreased to 0. Then the mainproportion of the females were immature. In comparison to fjordsin Northern Norway, spawning occurred earlier and the egg productionrate was remarkably lower in the Lurefjord than in Northern Norwegianfjords.

Reproduction in CH occurred earlierthan in CF, where the former did not feed at that time. Lipidcontent of CH decreased in March, when copepods started feeding.A maximum in feeding activity was reached in April, with lipidreserves increasing dramatically, especially in the upper waterlayer. From late spring onwards, the population of CH was representedby copepodids inhabiting the deep layers. Lipid content of CF,decreasing in March-April, was still low in June. Lipid reserveswere built up in July, and more 'fat' individuals were found atdepth. Sexual differentiation in CVs commenced in August, wheregonad development was associated with changes in lipid content.Both species entered the overwintering period as CIVs and CVs. A.F.

Daily, simulated averages of the flow field and temperaturesare used as model input. A simple biological model calculatesthe rate of development as a function of temperature. Integratingthis rate, the life stage is found which again determines theontogenetic vertical migration and the mortality rate. Initial distribution of particles, representing animalsof the same stage of development, are placed in the southern NorwegianSea (The Norwegian Basin) at the 600 m depth interface. Animalsmigrate to the surface and start spawning and their offspringsare released in the advective field. After this cohort (G1) hasreached CV there are two options. The G1-generation could chooseto moult into adults and produce a second generation (G2) or selecta vertical migration behavioural pattern ending in diapause.

Dag Slagstad: SINTEF Automatic Control, 7034 Trondheim NTH, Norway Calanus finmarchicusand the North Atlantic Oscillation B. Planque The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominantmode of interannual climate variability over the North Atlanticocean. This atmospheric phenomenon is characterised by two extremestates, the low NAO state during which, westerly winds are weakerand temperature colder over northern Europe and the high NAO statewhich displays a reverse climatic pattern. The state of the NAOis commonly measured by NAO index, the standardised sea levelpressure difference between the Azores (high pressure centre)and Iceland (low pressure centre). In the north-east Atlanticand the North Sea, abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicusmeasured by continuous plankton recorders during the past threedecades is strongly related to the NAO index (r=-0.76, P<0.01).This strong weather-plankton link suggests a 'short' connectionbetween weather changes and Calanus response. Several explanationscan be evoked to elucidate the link between NAO and Calanus.Evidence from satellite measurements and models of oceanic circulationare given to highlight the validity of these different scenarios.

Richardson, S. Jónasdóttir, S. Hayand M. Heath Measurements of Calanus finmarchicus egg productionhave been made on 6 cruises carried out between 1993 and 1996and spanning the months of October-March. Concommitant measurementsof phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll) and primary productionwere also carried out. These data allow us to examine and compareegg production at the end of the productive season and that occurringat the beginning of the growth season. Egg laying females wereobserved in October, January, February and March. However, onlyin October and March were the numbers of females in the watercolumn large enough so that the estimated Calanus egg productionrates exceeded 500 m-2.In October, the highest water column egg production estimateswere made in 'offshelf' waters while in March, the greatest watercolumn production rates were observed in slope waters. At thebeginning of the growth season, egg production rates normalisedto individual female were clearly correlated with food availability(chlorophyll). This was not the case in October. It is suggested,however, on the basis of measure phytoplankton standing stockand the known grazing efficiency of Calanus that ingestionof phytoplankton in during March was, in itself, not sufficientto fuel the egg production rates measured.

Runge, S. Plourde and E. Durbin As part of the US-GLOBEC Georges Bank programme,egg production rates of Calanus finmarchicus were measuredduring process cruises to Georges Bank occurring approximatelymonthly between January and June, 1995. Females were spawningcontinuously during this period. The median, wt-specific ratewas highest in February-March (10.5% d-1); at othertimes it varied between 5.5% d-1in January to 8% d-1in June. Females were capable of sustaining egg production undermost environmental conditions in the Georges Bank region. Theegg production rate measurements were used to calibrate the reproductiveindex, which is based on the proportion of females in preservedsamples carrying oocytes in advanced stages of vitellogenesis.The relationship, which was highly significant (r2=0.74), was used to hindcast female-specificegg production rates during the GLOBEC broadscale cruises, whichsampled a grid of ~40 stations monthly during the same January-Juneperiod. The product of the female-specific egg production ratewith the female abundance yields the daily input of eggs intothe water column (eggs m-2d-1). Geostatisticaltechniques were used to map the spatial distribution of egg productionduring each survey. The results show both spatial sources of recruitmentinto the population and variability of the Calanus preyfield for fish larvae in the Georges Bank region. J.A.

Durbin: School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island,Narragansett, RI 02882, USA Seasonal change of spawning habitat by Calanusfinmarchicus in Mid-Norwegian waters Stig Skreslet Calanus finmarchicus isconveyed from south to north by the Norwegian Coastal Current.During autumn parts of the stock invade deep fjords inside theMid-Norwegian shelf, situated between Trondheim and the LofotenIslands, to spend the winter. They start spawning in April whilethey are still in the wintering habitats, but probably drift withtheir offspring into shelf habitats as freshwater outflow increaseswith the snow melting rate, peaking in June. In 1995-96 fieldwork was carried out to investigate whether or not the specieswas spawning on the shelf itself, during summer. Observationson the Lofoten shelf from March to August 1995 established thatnauplii were produced during the whole summer, mostly on the innershelf. Observations in late July 1996 confirmed summer reproduction,but at the shelf break front. The spatial difference may be dueto an abnormally low freshwater outflow in 1995, causing frontsto be established closer to the shore. In late July 1996 observationswere also made on the inner shelf, farther south, where the Mid-Norwegianshelf is very wide. There, very active spawning occurred in ahyaline front established over a slope descending from the coastalarchipelago to the shelf itself. The slope front probably extendedalong the entire coast, possibly providing spawning conditionsfor C. finmarchicus all the way. Considering how the shelftopography varies with its banks and trenches, it may be expectedthat spawning habitats may also be established in hydrographicalfronts over the shelf itself, including the shelf break. Thus,it is hypothesised that the Mid-Norwegian shelf may be a majorsummer spawning region for the stock of C. finmarchicusthat inhabits the Norwegian Sea. It is also hypothesised thatthe fjords spring-spawning generation is a precursor, charginga larger number of spawners into the shelf's summer-spawning generation.To what extent the second generation mixes with first-generationmembers that drift onto the shelf from the continental slope duringsummer, is a matter of speculation. Stig Skreslet: Department of Fisheries and Science,Bodø College, N-8002 Bodø, Norway A routine molecular method for identificationof Calanus species? -theoretical basis and expectedpotential Rolf Sundt Occasionally accurate identification of Calanusspecies, based on morphological characters, can be difficult andlabour demanding. We have had an inquiry from other researcherswho have asked for the possibilities to develop a routine molecularmethod for this purpose. To evaluate the interest for such a methodto be developed, the theoretical basis for and expected potentialand limitations of a possible method are described. Rolf Sundt: Institute of Marine Research, PO Box1870, N-5024 Bergen-Nordnes, Norway Female dimorphism and sex switching in Calanusfinmarchicus (Gunnerus) C. Svendsen, K.S. Tande, C.B. Miller, J. Crain andC. Morgan Adult females were examined from November throughspring at sites near Georges Bank (41=BAN) and in Northern Norway(70=BAN) for the fractions with each of the quadrithek and tritheksetal patterns on the antennule. The quadrithek pattern is a malecharacter in which odd numbered, proximal segments carry two aesthetasscsas well as two setae; the trithek pattern has one aesthetasc onall antennular segments. Frequency of quadrithek females (%Q=3D100x Q/ {Q+T}) varied with both location and season. It peaked at13% in January on Georges Bank then declined gradually to 6% byJuly. In Northern Norwegian fjords (Grøtsund outside Tromsø)the early winter maximum was 38% declining to 25% by March. Thus,the ratio between quadritheks and tritheks varied seasonally atboth sites. It was consistent that higher proportions appearedearly, that is, among the first females emerging from the stockof resting copepodites. In the light of the hypothesis by Flemminger(1985) that females with the quadrithek pattern result from sexswitching by genetic males, we tested whether %Q in newly moultedfemales could be altered by separate exposure or the maturingCVs to adult males or females. The experiments were run with animalsfrom Grøtsund during the last three weeks prior to moultingof CVs. Of females not exposed to adults as CVs, 35% were quadritheks,while those exposed to adult males and females produced 33% and37% quadritheks, respectively. Based on the present data, thesex ratio of adult C. finmarchicus did not seam to influencethe proportion of females with male characters in the experiment.No evidence for sex specific pheromones was found and the stimulusfor sex change is therefore not revealed. Alternative explanationson sex change are suggested and discussed. C. Svendsen and K.S. Tande: University of Tromsø,Norwegian College of Fishery Science, 9037 Tromsø, Norway C.B. Miller, J.

Thomas Torgersen and Stein Kaartvedt Abnormally coloured Calanus were observedin the Oslofjord throughout the late summer and early autumn 1996.The exoskeletons were enervated by a deep red colour, while theprosome was filled with a yellow/orange mass, closely resemblingearlier descriptions of Ichthyophonus-infections in Calanus.Histological analyses of the infected animals also showed thatthe abnormally coloured animals were infected with Ichthyophonus,a parasite with uncertain taxonomic position. The infected individualsshowed an active orientation towards the surface layer and becameaccumulated in convergences and close to land in locations ofshorewards surface-currents. The visibility of prey to a visuallyhunting predator increases with light intensity and contrast withthe environment, but three-spined sticklebacks did not prey moreefficiently on infected Calanus than on not-infected individualsin the laboratory. Ichthyophonus is known to infect manyfish species, including herring with high prevalence of the parasite.A mechanism of infection in zooplanktivorous fish may be throughpredation on infected zooplankton. This would imply that the parasitewill benefit from altering host colouration and vertical distributionas shown here. Whether Calanus' active orientation towardsthe surface is directly induced by the parasite, or merely a consequenceof, for example, increased needs for food awaits further studies.

Campbell, and E.G. Durbin RNA content may offer a simple way to measure growthrates of zooplankton. We are currently examining the relationshipof RNA to growth rates and physiological condition in Calanusfinmarchicus. We have found that RNA:DNA ratios of Calanuscopepodites reflect food concentrations in laboratory culturesand that there are seasonal changes in RNA:DNA ratios of C4 andC5 Calanus on Georges Bank. In addition, the RNA:DNA ratiomay be a good indicator of diapause. Our current work is aimedat calibrating the relationship of RNA with growth rate and atusing RNA to assess growth rates and relative condition of C.finmarchicus in the Georges Bank region throughout 1995. In a recent laboratory experiment, we monitored growthand development of C. finmarchicus over the entire lifecycle at a range of temperatures and food concentrations. In additionto measuring development rate and carbon and nitrogen growth,we measured RNA, DNA and protein for copepods cultured from eggto adult. Preliminary results indicate that food concentrationwas the primary factor influencing RNA content. Temperature hadlittle effect on RNA and DNA content and RNA:DNA ratios. It shouldbe possible to formulate a linear model, involving temperatureand RNA, which can be used to estimate growth rates of C. finmarchicusin the field. To assess the relative condition of C. finmarchicusover the year and to relate condition to growth rate, egg production,and environmental factors, we surveyed RNA:DNA ratios of copepoditeand late naupliar stages from Georges Bank and nearby Gulf ofMaine during 1995. Copepods were sampled on monthly GLOBEC zooplanktonprocess cruises between January and June, and again in Octoberand November. Mean RNA:DNA ratios of C. finmarchicus onGeorges Bank increased over the period from January to June. InJanuary, RNA:DNA ratios of CV and adult female Calanuswere fairly homogeneous over the Bank and in the surface layersof nearby Gulf of Maine stations. By late May, however, ratioshad increased substantially in most areas of the Bank, but didnot change much in the off-bank regions. At stations in the Gulfof Maine and Slope Water, RNA:DNA ratios were always lower forcopepods in the deeper layers (>100m) than for those at thesurface. Changes in RNA:DNA ratios over the season appear to beconsistent with changes in food availability and growth ratesof Calanus copepodites. M.M. Wagner, R.G. Campbell, and E.G.

Scientific rationale:The ability of C. finmarchicus to colonise repeatedly thenorthern North Sea ecosystem during the spring and summer is hypothesisedto be in part a consequence of the overflow of Norwegian Sea DeepWater (NSDW) through the Faroe-Shetland Channel into the Atlantic,and the propensity for C. finmarchicus to accumulate andoverwinter in this water mass (Backhaus et al, 1994). The juxtapositionof the Faroe-Shetland Channel and the northwest European shelfis such that a high proportion of copepodites emerging from depthin the spring are assured of successful colonisation of the NorthSea under a range of weather conditions, whilst the deep verticalmigration of late stage copepodites washed out of the North Seain the autumn will return at least a part of the population tothe NSDW for overwintering. The extension of this hypothesis tobe addressed in this Task is that a similar association betweenC.finmarchicus and NSDW operates along the mid-shelf westof Norway, on Faroe Plateau, and along the southern and southwesterncoast of Iceland. If this is the case then correlated trends inthe seasonal dynamics of C. finmarchicus in each of thesesystems may be explained in terms of ocean scale circulation patterns. SUBTASK 1: Overwintering, acrossshelf advection and spring spawning in Shetland-Faroe and southeasternIcelandic waters PI: Katherine Richardsson (kr@dfu.min.dk) Objective: The objectives of the subtask are to a) track theNSDW overflow between Faroe Bank and Faroe Plateau, across theIceland-Faroe Ridge, and along the shelf edge off southern Iceland,and to determine the association between this water and overwinteringC.finmarchicus, and b) to determine the routes for invasionof these shelf ecosystems by C.finmarchicus in the spring. Scientific rationale: Knowledge of the deep water circulation and overwinterdistribution of C. finmarchicus around the Greenland-ScotlandRidge is sketchy in some areas. The southerly flow of NSDW throughthe Faroe-Shetland Channel is only a small part of the outflowfrom the Norwegian and Greenland Seas into the North Atlantic.Most of the outflow is through the Denmark Strait west of Iceland.Further flows are found between Iceland and Faroe. NSDW in theFaroe-Shetland Channel rarely flows over the Wyville-Thomson Ridge,but mainly passes through the gap between Faroe-bank and FaroePlateau. Hydrodynamic considerations suggest that this water shouldconstitute a constrained deep plume flowing in a northwesterlydirection along the Atlantic face of the Iceland-Faroe Ridge whichwill be augmented by overflow across the Ridge. Such a featurehas been identified as a deep cold water mass along the slopeoff southern Iceland (Malmberg and Magnusson, 1982). The NSDWin the Faroe-Shetland Channel contains high concentrations (>100/m3)of stage V C. finmarchicus during the winter months. Ifthe water mass remains identifiable along the Atlantic face ofthe Ridge and off southern Iceland, then it is hypothesised thatC. finmarchicus will also be found in these areas duringthe winter. The modelling subtask (5) will be able to predictthe timing and location of spring invasions of the Faroese andsoutheastern Iceland shelf regions by C. finmarchicus originatingfrom such deep subsurface features, and thus sampling the distributionof animals in the spring will provide a valuable validation ofthe models and a comparative test of the generality of the Backhaushypothesis. Methodology: The campaign of field surveys will: a) map the distribution and physiology of Calanusin relation to hydrography in the winter (December-January) aroundthe Faroe plateau, Faroe Bank, the ridge between Faroe and Iceland,and along the southern shelf of Iceland. The specific objectiveof this campaign will be to establish the spatial extent of theassociation between C. finmarchicus and water of NorwegianSea origin which is expected to be found at depths >500m, andto track the overflow plume of NSDW along the Atlantic face ofthe Greenland-Scotland ridge. b) sampling of Calanus distribution and physiologyin the spring (February-April) in the area between Scotland andIceland. The specific objectives of this campaign will be firstto establish the specific localities where Calanus firstinvades the Faroe and Iceland continental shelves, and to confirmthe invasion pattern of the European Shelf detected during ICOS.Second, to determine the routes and rates of spreading from theshelf edge invasion area onto each of the shelf regions, and thedistribution of reproductive activity in relation to phytoplanktonactivity. c) collection of fine spatial scale hydrographicand vessel mounted acoustic doppler current profiler data on theshelf edge currents in the area to be covered by the hydrodynamicmodelling activity. Standard transects will be completed on each occasion,forming a baseline for intercomparison of data from the variouscampaigns, together with a more widespread network of samplinglocations covering the shelf margins. The "standard transects"will coincide with nationally established monitoring stationsin Icelandic, Faroese and UK shelf regions so that the data canbe viewed in the context of long-term variability in conditions.A critical component of the plankton sampling is the ability tocollect fine vertically resolved (20-40m) samples from depth downto 1000m, together with in-situ particle counts. Equipment toperform this task is already available in the project (MLA) andcan be deployed from a variety of survey vessels. SUBTASK 2: Overwintering, advection,and spring spawning south and southwest of Iceland PI: Astthor Gislason (astthor@hafro.is) Objective: a) To identify the overwintering sites of C. finmarchciussouth and southwest of Iceland. b) Describe the conditionand population structure of the overwintering populations in deepwater south and southwest of Iceland in late winter in relationto the physical and biological environment. c) Describe the ascentand advection of the overwintering animals onto the banks in latewinter, and their subsequent spawning, and how these are influencedby environmental factors. Scientific rationale: C.finmarchicus dominatesthe mesozooplankton in Icelandic waters as elsewhere in the NorthAtlantic (Conover 1988, Astthorsson et al. 1983, Astthorsson andGislason 1995), and it constitutes an important food for fishlarvae on the main spawning grounds of the commercially most importantIcelandic fish stocks (e.g cod, haddock, capelin) south and southwestof Iceland. The spring spawning of C. finmarchicus lastsfrom March to May, and there is both regional and between yearvariability in the timing of spring spawning in the area (Gislasonet al. 1994, Gislason and Astthorsson 1995). However, the reasonsfor this variability are not clear. Given that the year classstrength of the fish stocks is determined during the first feedingperiod this variability has large implications for the recruitmentto the fish stocks (Cushing 1990). The sea area south and southwestof Iceland (the Iceland Basin and the Irminger Sea) is probablyan important overwintering site for the Calanus stockssouthwest of Iceland and these regions may be of the same importanceas overwintering areas for Calanus in Icelandic watersas the Norwegian basin is for the stocks in Norwegian waters andthe Barents sea. However, a part of the stock may also overwinterover the shallower banks. No study exists which has been speciallydesigned to study the overwintering of Calanus south andsouthwest of Iceland, and the emergence and advection of overwinteredanimals onto the banks south and west of the island. Methodology: A comprehensive sampling of the horizontal and verticaldistribution of C. finmarchicus will be carried out inlate winter and spring 1996 and 1997 using vessels from MRI. Thesampling will be carried out on several cruises in 1996 (January-July)and 1997 (January-April). During each survey the sampling willbe conducted at standard sections south and southwest of Iceland.These transects are selected because they run across the mainspawning grounds and larval drift route of the major Icelandiccommercial fish stocks. Further, long term data (since 1971) onhydrography, phytoplankton production and zooplankton biomassare available from these transects, and to which the TASC-datacan be compared. Sampling gear: Hydrography: Seabird ElectronicsSBE-9 CTD. Phytoplankton: Sea-Tech Fluorometer, Transmissiometer,standard 14-C incubations Zooplankton: BIONESS multiple net samplingsystem. SUBTASK 3: Analysis of historicaltime series data PI: Ed McKenzie (ed@stams.strathclyde.ac.uk) Objective: To determine trends and seasonal cycles in abundanceof Calanus in different regions of the NE Atlantic andexamine evidence for correlations between regions, by extendingthe statistical time series analysis of data from the ContinuousPlankton Recorder (CPR) surveys carried out for the North Seaduring ICOS to include a wider area of the North Atlantic andNorwegian Sea, and draw this together with an analysis of historicaltime series data from Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian and Russiansources. Scientific rationale: Although dedicated field programmes can provide exceptionalinsight into the processes governing Calanus populationdynamics, they rarely give any indication of long term trendsor mean seasonal signals. Such information is vital for characterisingdifferent ecosystems and the similarities between them, and forrevealing the effects of long-term change. For this purpose, long-runningtime series data are required. The Continuous Plankton RecorderSurveys are a well known source of time series data for the NorthAtlantic and other oceans. Although sampling first started in1931 in the North Sea, routine sampling, which meets the standardsof present day procedures, commenced in 1946 with monthly resolutionalong a number of routes across the northeast Atlantic. Thesedata thus constitute a spatial time series extending in some localitiesover several decades and which can be used to make seasonal comparisonsbetween specific areas. Data therefore exist in the CPR databaseto compare off and on shelf populations of Calanus speciesas well as create time series of changes in population levelsin specified areas. In addition, various long-term data sets on zooplanktonspecies abundances have been collected by national organisationsin their own territorial waters. Although these may lack the temporalresolution of the CPR data, they have the advantage in most casesof being depth integrated rather than simply sampled from theupper 10m. These data thus represent a powerful complement tothe CPR records, providing an opportunity to 'calibrate' the CPRdata and validate the long term trends. Assimilation, and in somecases archaeology and recovery of these data for the TASC projectis therefore an important activity. Specific data have been identifiedin Iceland (MRII), the Faroe Islands Fisheries Laboratory, andat PINRO in Murmansk, Russia. For example the Icelandic data havebeen collected during May-June each year since 1961. The materialhas recently been analysed with respect to long term trends inbiomass (Astthorsson and Gislason, 1995). However, the seriesalso contains information on zooplankton composition and the stagestructure of C. finmarchicus, but these data have neverbeen analysed. Similarly, the Russian date set contains zooplanktonbiomass observations from May and July each year since 1959.Relativelylittle work has been reported on modelling either the CPR dataseries, or many of the national banked data on zooplankton timeseries. The identification of such models leads to effective summariesof the series in terms of model structure and parameters, andhence facilitates comparisons between species in different locationsand at different times. Methodology: Supply of additional CPR data, beyond those obtainedin respect of ICOS, will be negotiated with the Sir Alister HardyFoundation, UK. Long term data from sampling in Icelandic watersis currently in manuscript form and will be collated and digitisedat MRII. Similarly, access to data for Faroese waters will benegotiated. Comprehensive data on zooplankton in the Barents andNorwegian Seas are known to exist at the PINRO in Murmansk. Thesewill be collated and digitised through collaboration between UITØand local scientists in Russia (Degtereva 1979). The approachto analysing the CPR and other data will have two main thrusts.The first of these is data analytic. This consists of identifyingand developing smoothing and filtering procedures for the estimationof the long term trend and the annual seasonal cycle for eachseries. Considerable care and ingenuity will be required to extractaccurate and reliable estimates because of the frequent sparsityof the individual time series and the fact that the observationsare interrupted by sequences of zeros. In addition, the data aresubject to spatio-temporal variability in sampling intensity,and this should be taken into account in any statistical analysisand modelling. The second effort consists of the constructionand validation of suitable time series models for individual series.The mixed nature of the data, referred to above, necessitatesthe use of non linear time series modelling, a major area of currentresearch interest. SUBTASK 4: Generation patternand switching along the Norwegian midshelf PI: Kurt Tande (ktande@nfh.uit.no) Objective: To describe the across shelf transport of Calanusalong the shelf edge from Møre to Lofoten, and identifythe physical and biological factors responsible for the switchfrom a two generation to an annual generation pattern along theNorwegian midshelf sector. Scientific rationale: In the entire study area C. finmarchicus altersbetween 1-3 generations a year. These patterns are only crudelydefined on a regional basis. The general situation is that thenumber of generations decreases going from low latitudes to higher,and the literature indicate a 2 generation pattern around theBritish Isles, Faroe Island and even up to the Western coast ofNorway (Wiborg 1955). Lofoten, is often referred to as the northerndemarcation line for this two generation cycle (Lie 1965, Tande1991), but substantial gaps in our knowledge of this issue arelacking. Combining the ontogenetic vertical behavior with theprevailing current pattens along the Norwegian shelf might clarifythe condition. Surface currents will tend to bring the reproducingfemales and the recruits northwards, while a progressively deeperposition in the water column will tend to reduce the speed ofthis transport. At some stage in the growth cycle, informationare imposed making CIV and CV capable of deciding on how to proceed:continuing to moulting or descending to diapause. The proportionof CIV and CV recruited from the overwintering generation, leavingfor diapause in May and June will certainly increase with latitudegoing from Møre to Lofoten. Unpublished data on CIV andCV dry weight from the shelf and the shelf break outside Tromsø,do indicate that the copepod body size varies with depth and timeduring the productive season. This region from Møre toLofoten should be revisited several times during the spring andsummer period. Although the physical conditions are well studied,this project will be organised as a multidisiplinary study withstrong basis in physical oceanography and modelling. Methodology: The project will visit the midshelf from Møreto Lofoten during three cruises each of 10 days duration withR.V. "Jan Mayen" in February, April, May and July in1996. On the cruises in 1996, the physical oceanography of thearea will be detailed by CTD (including Flouresence and Lightmeasurements) and the current patterns will be obtained by continousrecords from ADCP. These will provide input data to a well developedphysical model already at hand at SINTEF (Slagstad, 1995). Thevertical and horizontal distribution of life stages will be comparedbetween onshelf and deeper offshelf areas at selected sites fromMøre to Lofoten. Vertical profile sampling will be carriedout by MOCNESS and with the MLA in-situ particle counter (subtask1). During this time period the proportion between CIV/CV fromG1 descending to depths or contining to reproduction will be inferredfrom potential differences in sex-differentiation in CV, sex-ratiosand maturation patterns in adult females, dry weight, prosomelengths and physiological activity. SUBTASK 5: Modelling the cross-shelfdispersal of Calanus PI: Jan O. Backhaus (backhaus@dkrz.d400.de) Objectives: a) To model the finely resolved flow field at theshelf edge in each of the following areas - S Iceland, Faroe,Shetland, W. Norway. b) To explain the observed seasonal evolutionof Calanus distribution and abundance in each of the aboveregions using particle tracking models driven by simulated flowfields. Scientific rationale: The hypothesis behind the task is that the seasonalcolonisation of the shelf seas from the adjacent ocean basin depthsby Calanus depends on an interaction between copepod behaviourand the characteristic flow fields in the surface waters, especiallythe continental slope currents, and the less energetic deep circulationpatterns which form a link between the various shelf regions.Simulation and sensitivity analysis of this phenomenon requiresa combination of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic modelling and lagrangianparticle tracking. Three types of model development are requiredfor the task. The first is the application of a system of 3 nestedhydrodynamic models to previously unmodelled shelf edge regions,to provide high resolution (4km grid spacing, 1hr time resolution)flow field simulations of the continental slope currents. Thesecond is the development of a new model system to simulate thecirculation and overflow of Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW) throughthe Denmark Strait and around and over the Iceland-Scotland Ridge.The third development is the coupling of flow fields generatedby these models to a particle tracking model including the facilityto include biological properties and responses. Methodology: At present, a nested model system exists only forthe northwest Scottish shelf edge (in the NE Atlantic) as a productof the ICOS project (MAS2-CT94-0085). In the proposed task, thesame approach will be applied to model the Faroese, Icelandicand Norwegian shelf edge waters. Similarly, particle trackingschemes to make use of the simulated flow field have been developedduring ICOS and will be applied to the new regions, but will requireto be extended to accommodate application of the proposed developmentof circle-map models of generation cycle characteristics (Subtask14). The modelling of NSDW circulation and overflow will be acompletely new development. The basis for the hydrodynamic modelswill be the HAMSOM (Hamburg Shelf-Ocean Model) finite differencecoding which has evolved from an original model developed by Backhaus(1985). The model systems will be used to carry out a sensitivityanalysis of the scope for variability in climatological forcingat a variety of scales to influence the success of Calanusin colonising the various shelf regions, and in the scopefor correlations in population characteristics between shelf regionsresulting from a teleconnection through the deep water circulation. The modelling work will be shared by three partners.IFM will develop and apply the hydrodynamic models for the regions.SINTEF and MLA have collaborated in developing the particle trackingscheme in IOCS and will continue to do so in TASC. As in ICOS,the Lagrangian simulations will be run separately from the hydrodynamicmodel by transferring the output data from the HAMSOM model toSINTEF and MLA for further applications. TASK 2. LARGE SCALE DISTRIBUTION,LIFE HISTORY AND PREDATION PI: Stein Kaartvedt (steinka@bio.uio.no) Objective: The distribution, abundance and population structureof Calanus are governed by production, predation, advectionand behaviour. Tasks 2 will address these topics on differentspatial and temporal scales. We aim to map large scale and seasonaldistribution patterns and establish the degree of genetic coherenceof Calanus in the northern Seas. Variations in populationstructure and distribution will be studied along latitudinal gradientsto establish how temporal and geographic patterns in physics,primary production and predation pressure influence generationdevelopment, life history and behaviour. SUBTASK 6: Large scale fieldsurvey PI: Bjørnar Ellertsen (bjoernar.ellertsen@imr.no) Objective: Describe the large scale distribution, abundance,and population structure of C. finmarchicus in the NordicSeas for the summer and winter seasons, and assess the geneticcohesiveness of C. finmarchicus Scientific rationale: The population dynamics of C. finmarchicusin the Nordic Seas are influenced both by local environmentalconditions and advection which transports individuals betweendifferent regions. We hypothesise that a core habitat of the speciesis the large scale gyre in the Norwegian Sea, and that its lifecycle has been shaped by adaptation to the specific conditionsof seasonal primary production and predation from migratory (e.g.herring) and non-migratory predators (e.g. mesopelagic fishes,invertebrates). Within its range of distribution, C. finmarchicusencounters a wide range of environmental and biological conditions,e.g. in the seasonal variation in light, primary production, temperatureand predation. This is likely to be reflected in the number ofgenerations produced and in the success of their completion. Although numerous scientific papers have focusedon C. finmarchicus the last 50 years, information has mainlybeen gathered through sampling in limited parts of its distributionalarea. Hence, basic quantitative population dynamics of this speciesare known primarily for certain enclosed fjord areas. Advectionwill influence any time series obtained at a fixed position inthe open ocean. For this reason there is a need to sample a widerarea in order to allow for an estimate of the role of advection.By describing the abundance and population structure in summerwhen the cohorts of developing copepodites are present in theupper layer, one can get information on the timing of the seasonaldevelopment of the new generation and the likely number of generationsin different regions. This will allow identification of areaswhere the second generation is underway, where the first generationhave descended into deeper water, where the first generation showa late development, and areas where situations intermediate betweenthese exist. This large scale pattern of generational developmentcan be related to the strong latitudinal gradient in light, thestrong temperature gradient from East to West, and the advectionby the large scale circulation system of the Nordic Seas. Surveys of the distribution, abundance and populationstructure of the overwintering population of C. finmarchicusin the Nordic Seas will be carried out to identify overwinteringareas which are of importance for the population dynamics andsummer distribution.The northwards flowing Atlantic Current onthe eastern side of the Nordic Seas branches out into the cyclonicgyres of the Norwegian and Greenland Seas. This circulation allowsfor the possibility of "generation stacking", wherethe second generation originating from initial spawning in thesouthern regions descends to overwinter in the same areas wherethe first generation from spawning further north has also descended.The distribution pattern of overwintering C. finmarchicuswill determine the source populations which ascend into the upperocean advective current regime to spawn the following winter. Genetic cohesiveness of a species gene pool is botha determinant and a result of the evolutionary and ecologicalforces acting on that species population. The genetic cohesivenessof a species' population will determine likelihood of raciatonor speciaton events, responses to environmental change, probabilityof extinction, and rates of evolution. Furthermore, a species'genetic cohesiveness across its distributional range may be usedas an indicator of the linkage among ecostystems. If genetic exchangeamong sub-populations of a number of important species at differenttrophic levels is sufficiently small, ecosystems may be said tobe functionally distinct. Conversely, high levels of gene flowsuggest that dynamic processes in the different ecosystems arefunctionally interrelated. Circulation patterns in the NorwegianSea and the adjacent regions may facilitate development of planktonicsubpopulations. Methodology: Summer distributions of C. finmarchicus willbe determined by sampling with MOCNESS, BIONESS or MULTINET multiplesampling systems and WP-2 nets, and by acoustical mapping withshipborne echo sounders (38, 120, 200 kHz). Supporting informationon hydrography (CTD), phytoplankton development (nutrients, chlorophyll,in situ fluoresence), zooplankton size-fractioned biomass, anddistribution and abundance of fish (acoustics, pelagic trawl)will be collected by continuous recording and vertical profiling. This study of genetics will use the frequencies ofdifferent alleles of several genes to describe population structure.Allelic variation of the genes will be determined by variationin the DNA sequence of a portion of each gene for individual copepods.DNA will be extracted from individual copepodes. A region of mitochondrialDNA will be amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology(Innis et al. 1990). Specific techniques are described in Bucklinand Kann (1991) and Stanton et al. (1992). Amplified DNA willbe sequenced, and sequences will be alligned to those of otherindividuals of C. finmarchicus from the Norwegian Sea. The DNAsequencing will be carried out at University of Bergen where wehave access to an Automated DNA Sequencer. The frequency of eachsequence variant in each region will be determined. Standard populationgenetic analyses of population stucture based on allele frequencieswill be done to determine whether the species is significantlystuctured in the Norwegian Sea. SUBTASK 7: Comparative timeseries sampling programme PI: Stein Kaartvedt (steinka@bio.uio.no) PI: Tone Falkenhaug (tonehf@nfh.uit.no) Objective: Describe the annual cycle of vertical distribution,generational development and overwintering of C. finmarchicusat selected locations in the Nordic Seas. Intercompare the regionalpatterns of seasonal migration and generational development andrelate them to seasonal patterns of hydrography and phytoplanktondevelopment. Scientific rationale: There are few time series available which describethe full annual cycle of C. finmarchicus with samplingover an extended part of the water column and temporal resolutionof less then a month. The few available time series are mainlyfrom fjords and coastal waters (Tande 1982, Matthews et al. 1978).An exception is the unique time series obtained by weekly samplingat weathership station "M" in the Norwegian Sea (Østvedt1955). The annual cycle of C. finmarchicus depends on anumber of factors and conditions: stage and state at the beginningof overwintering, temperature and activity during overwintering,maturation and ascent, temperature and feeding conditions forreproduction and cohort development, number of generations, andtiming and duration of overwintering. We will conduct a coordinated and comparative samplingprogramme in order to describe the annual cycle of C. finmarchicusat selected locations in and surounding the Nordic Seas and inwaters south of Iceland. The programme will consist of two components: 1. Frequent sampling (about two weeks interval) atnear-shore locations at the south coast of Iceland, the Faroese,Shetland, and Lofoten in Norway, and at the weathership at station"M" in the eastern Norwegian Sea. 2. Less frequent sampling (2-10 weeks interval dependingon season and practicality) at oceanographic sections across theshelf and out into the deep ocean at the east and northeast coastof Iceland, at the Faroese, and at Møre and Vesterålenin Norway (see map Fig. 1). The main programme will be carried out in 1997 coordinatedwith a similar programme in the northwestern Atlanitc by US GLOBECand possibly Canada. Part of the sampling programme will alsobe carried out in 1996. The results on the population structureand dynamics of C. finmarchicus from the time series samplingprogramme will be interpreted against the background of informationon advection by the large scale circulation system which transportand redistribute the population, and on the distribution of C.finmarchicus revealed by the summer (1996, 1997) and winter(1996/97) large scale surveys. Methodology: The programme will be carried out preferentiallywith depth-stratified sampling by 200 um multiple net samplingsystems (BIONESS, MOCNESS or MULTINET), or with vertical (WP-2)or oblique (Bongo) net hauls where operation of multiple netsare not practically possible. Taxonomic analysis to species andstage, including separation of C. finmarchicus from theclosely related species C. glacialis and C. helgolandicus.Size frequency analysis will be performed on subsets of data.Standard protocols of sampling and taxonomic analysis will beestablished, and intercalibration will be carried out as partof QA. Supporting information on hydrography (CTD) and phytoplanktondevelopment (nutrients, chlorophyll, in situ fluorescence) willbe collected. SUBTASK 8: Calanusin different light and predatory regimes PI: Stein Kaartvedt (steinka@bio.uio.no) Objectives: Assess mortality risk of Calanus with respectto visual predators (fish) along a latitudinal gradient in theNorwegian Sea and how this impacts plankton vertical distributionand life history traits. Scientific rationale: Latitudinal and seasonal gradients in light conditionsare fundamental elements of the Norwegian sea ecosystem, probablywith profound impact on predator-prey relationships between visualpredators and Calanus. We will address the following hypotheses: 1. Northern stocks of Calanus to a large extentleave upper layers for overwintering in early summer (Østvedt1955). We hypothesize that the early descent is due to an unprofitabletradeoff between food intake and danger of predation inregions/seasons with midnight sun or very short dark periods. 2. Horizontally migrating fish (e.g. herring andmackerel) are major visual predators on Calanus duringsummer (Melle et al. 1994). By relying on their schooling behaviourand rapid swimming in predator avoidance, they may forage in upperlayers by day. 3. Resident, mesopelagic fish performing diel verticalmigrations (Benthosema glaciale, Maurolicus muelleri) aremajor predators on Calanus in periods/regions with day/nightcycles, but not in periods/regions with mid-night sun. They feedactively on near surface copepod assemblages during short "antipredatorywindows" near sunset and sunrise, and their large eyes possiblyalso facilitates fairly efficient feeding during night (Giskeet al. 1990, Aksnes & Giske 1993). They do not prey on Calanusduring day in seasons when the copepods inhabit upper layers.An unprofitable light climate for feeding conditions may reducethe success of mesopelagic fish at high latitudes. 4. Calanus overwintering depth in the Norwegiansea is related to the prevailing predatory field with mesopelagicfish playing a key role. In the presence of mesopelagic fish,oceanic stocks of Calanus descend to great depths duringwinter since these fishes are foraging efficiently at low lightintensities. In waters devoid of mesopelagic fish, however, Calanusmay select an overwintering depth without being constrained byvisual predators. If mesopelagic fish are excluded (or stronglyreduced in numbers) at high latitudes, this may impact habitatchoice of Calanus during winter. 5. Calanus exhibits flexibility in selectionof overwintering depth with respect to presence of prevailingpredators Methodology: Studies on zooplankton vertical distribution willbe done by MOCNESS, Multinet, WP2 net, Juday net or by pump. Fishwill be assessed acoustically (SIMRAD EK 500, 38 Khz), and byHarstad trawl. Studies on the impact of midnight sun willbe performed on cruises with "Jan Mayen" in May andJuly 1996, and on a cruise with "Haakon "Mosby"from waters off Bergen to north of the polar circle the summerof 1997. Studies on migration and feeding by mesopelagic fishwill be carried out along the same transects. Egg production measurements(by incubation) will be done along the same transect. Animalsfor gut fluorescence measurements will be sampled day and night.Size fractionated chlorophyll measurements will be performed toassess field feeding conditons. Studies on the vertical distributionof Calanus along a latitudinal gradient during winter willbe done in cooperation with the Institute of Marine Research,Bergen, using their research vessels. The flexibility in selectionof overwintering habitat will also be addressed by comparativestudies the vertical distribution of Calanus in fjordswith, and without mesopelagic fish. Two-day cruises with the researchvessel "Hans Brattstroem" will be carried out each month(budget permitting) from the summer 1996 to spring 1997, complementedby cruises with RV "Haakon Mosby" spanning several days.We will synthesize data on herring and mackerel abundance, distributionand feeding to get a rough estimate on their potential pedationimpact on Calanus. SUBTASK 9: Data management(database) PI: Bjørnar Ellertsen (bjoernar.ellertsen@imr.no) Objectives: Develop and maintain a data management policy (re.reporting, handling and property) covering all the subtasks inTASC along those lines developed in the Code of Data Managementin MAST-III Projects. Scientific rationale and methodology: Some of the data management needs in TASC are fairlyconventional in character for the CTD data type. Small data setsof currents measurements from shipborn ADCP, will be aquired duringthe project, but plans have to be developed in the project inorder to handle these data as they are considered important forthe validation of large and nested hydrodynamic models in someof the subtasks. Here TASC will build on experience attained inOMEX and other projects which have been frequently using ADCPfor current measurements. Other, small data sets from laboratoryand mesocosms experiments, will be aquired during the project,but no plans have been made to handle these data as they are requiredby individual researchers, and are considered to be of minor valueto the overall TASC database. On the other hand, the data bankfor the zooplankton, providing information on biomass and demographyin the TASC study area will be established. This is considereda major challenge in this subtask. Since ICES will be doing theplankton management, for the Arctic Ocean Grand Challenge, ifapproved, ICES and IMR will work closely to ensure compatibleas possible procedures for managing zooplankton data in variousproposed EU projects in this area. The Institute of Marine Research has designed anIngres relation database that include all type of marine data.The database is designed as a generic structure in order to allowfor the integration of data. This implies that new types of datacan be modelled to fit into the database. For the present datafrom CTD, nutrients, plankton, fish egg and larvae and fish ismodelled for the database. IMR have worked out routine for qualitycontrol of CTD data, and is working on quality procedures fornutrients and plankton. The database was set into production fromJanuary 1995 The responsibiliy of ICES in this Data Managementsubtask will be to oversee and analyse the results of any insitu and instrument intercalibration exercises, ensuring thatdocumentation accompanying the data is complete and accurate,all CTD data to be pre-processed and calibrated in accordancewith the guidelines set by SCOR WG 51 and the JPOTS OceanographicManual, with the independent variable being expressed in decibars(pressure). Furthermore, the CTDs must be calibrated on each andevery deployment, data to be supplied in formats and media tobe mutually agreed, data will be quality assessed in accordancewith standard ICES procedures. This will include comparisons withclimatology. The responsible scientists must respond immediatelyon any matters related to measurement quality. ICES will not setflags for doubtful quality, but all such cases will be documented,and resolved via a discussion between ICES and the responsiblescientist, and if necessary, the project coordinator. compatiblewith the institutes software resources. On the application side,efforts will be put into building general easy-to use data selections.An agreed system of encryption will be used to prevent unauthorisedaccess. SUBTASK 10 Modelling the effectof large scale advection and life cycle strategies PI: Bjørnar Ellertsen (bjoernar.ellertsen@imr.no) Objectives: Quantify how advection within the Norwegian Sea andlife cycle strategies (number of generations per year, developmentalrate and vertical migration behaviour) interact to produce thedistribution pattern and high production rate of this speciesthat is observed. Scientific rationale: The eastern part of the Norwegian Sea receives warmAtlantic water mainly through the Faroe -Shetland channel. Thiswater flows northward along the eastern continental slope. Sincethe temperature is higher here than elsewhere, the growth rateand the number of generations per year is higher than in otherparts of the Norwegian Sea. New generations of C. finmarchicusare usually developing in the upper 300 m where the northwardtransport is fast. A female that ascends from its overwinteringdepth North of Shetland may produce offsprings that, after twoor three generations descend to deep water outside Northern Norwayin late summer. How can the southern population maintain itselfwhen the advection losses apparently should dilute the stock rapidly?Is the productivity of the Northern stock (Lofoten Basin) in thelong run dependent on supply from the Norwegian Basin stock? Southwardtransport may take place as a counter flow below the slope currentor in the basin wide gyres. It may take years to complete thiscycle. Methodology: The answers to the questions addressed here can onlybe acheived through a combined, basin wide hydrodynamical modelcoupled to a life cycle model of C. finmarchicus. Typicallymodel simulations periods will be a year or more. Since thereare many uncertainties both in the biology of Calanus andthe current field when such long term simulations are performed,model investigation will concentrate on scenarios and sensitivitytests. Three climatic cases will be simulated: Climatic averagewith monthly mean flow field and temperatures, and two cases withhigh and low inflow of Atlantic water, respectively, using dailyaverage flow. These simulations will be performed by the ECOM-3Dwhich is already established for the area by HI. Climatologicalmean flow is already available (Engedahl et al. 1995). Modellingdeep circulation depends to a large degree on a correct densityfield. Improvement of the existing field by available observationswill be performed before the last two scenarios are produced.The elements that comprise a life cycle model (generation time,developmental rate and vertical migration behaviour, survivalprobability), are investigated in other subtasks. The life cyclemodel will be of a Lagrangian type where particles having attachedstate variables. Each particle is allowed to develop (change state),die and reproduce by spawning of new particles having state variablestypical for off-springs. Several scenarios will be performed wereparameters (and assumptions) in the life cycle model are perturbedfor each of climatic cases. TASK 3: PHYSIOLOGY, GROWTH ANDREPRODUCTION PI: Roger Harris (rph@wpo.nerc.ac.uk) Objectives: TASC experimental studies will combine laboratory,mesocosm, and shipboard experimentation with modelling to advancequantitative knowledge of the feeding biology, reproductive biology,and key life-cycle phenomena of Calanus finmarchicus overthe trans latitudinal range. This component of TASC will interactstrongly with the proposed field programme, both by providingkey analytical and shipboard experimental input to TASC cruises,and also by testing, under defined laboratory conditions, criticalhypotheses generated by the field programme. SUBTASK 11: Regional and seasonalvariability of feeding and reproduction. PI: Hans-Jürgen Hirche (hhirche@awi-bremerhaven.de) Objectives: Develop and standardize methods to assess egg productionfrom live and preserved specimens. Establish the annual life andreproductive cycle in different water masses in relation to phytoplanktondevelopment and abiotic conditions. Determine the influence ofenvironmental variables on feeding and reproduction. Scientific rationale: The only data on the complete seasonal reproductivecycle of C. finmarchicus are from 2 fjords (Diel and Tande1992, Plourde and Runge 1993). From more sporadic measurementsa strong regional variability of the beginning of the spawningseason, usually associated with the spring bloom, has been observed,although microzooplankton was shown to be an adequate substitutefor phytoplankton as a food source. It has been known for a longtime that C. finmarchicus can breed through up to threegenerations per year, but the regional variability of the numberof generations is not at all understood. The time series workat weathership "M" and selected stations on cruiseswill be used for this work. In order to cover a wide geographicrange including the open ocean, we will employ a combination ofstandardized measurements of egg production from live specimensand from preserved samples. To achieve this, an existing method(Runge 1987) will be improved by including histological preparationsof the female gonad. A strong discrepancy has been observed between life-timefecundity of females fed in the laboratory (Hirche 1991) and afjord population (Diel and Tande 1992), which laid only 20 % ofthe eggs spawned by laboratory females. We will tackle this problemby studying the effect of female condition, food quantity andquality on egg production. The role of senescence of females willalso be investigated. Methodology: Grazing, female condition (CN and lipid composition,gonad maturity) egg production (on shipboard and preserved samples),hatching viability, and nauplii survival will be determined. SUBTASK 12: Culture experimentson nutrition, growth and reproduction PI: Roger Harris (rhp@wpo.nerc.ac.uk) Objective: To define the biochemical components of the dietneeded for Calanus growth and reproduction and to determine,using laboratory cultures, how growth, egg production, and eggviability vary with the diversity of diet. Scientific rationale: This subtask will establish cultures of C. finmarchicus,using material collected in the field programme, and will buildon experience with C. helgolandicus, cultures of whichare currently maintained over multiple generations at PML. Thisapproach will provide relevant information for understanding lifecycle phenomena and contribute to the calibration and validationof the population dynamics model (subtask 14). The culture facilitywill provide a central resource for TASC, both for studying behaviouralmechanisms determining life history strategy, and enable new biochemicaland molecular techniques to be evaluated under controlled conditions,before deployment in the field programme. In addition the laboratoryculture experiments will address aspects of overwintering physiologybased on suggestions from the field programme. The effect of environmentalvariables will be considered and the aim will be to mimic multi-generationCalanus population dynamics in the laboratory. It is anultimate goal to have both sibling species in simultaneous culture,enabling critical comparative physiological studies to be madeunder defined conditions. An increased effort in nutritional biochemistry,particularly lipid biochemistry, exploring the dietary links betweenCalanus and its food environment will significantly advanceunderstanding of the relationships between diet and production.Dietary diversity is expected to enhance production. Recognisingthe importance of omnivory (Kleppel, 1993), new approaches areneeded to establish relations between food quantity and quality,and development rate and egg production. It is well established that lipids play a vital rolein the life history strategies of polar organisms (Sargent etal., 1993). However, it is poorly understood: a) how environmentalvariables determine the production of lipids in the marine environmentand hence the availability to C. finmarchicus, b) the rateat which dietary lipid is ingested/assimilated by C. finmarchicusand/or biosynthesised in the field, c) if, in some circumstances,the availability of essential dietary lipids in the marine environmentaffects the growth and reproduction of Calanus. Optimalgrowth and egg production by Calanus requires an adequatefood composition; some essential fatty acids, for example, cannotbe synthesised by copepods. It is not clear whether the naturalfood environment is generally adequate in dietary terms, or whetherCalanus spp. are sometimes limited by food compositionin nature as opposed to food concentration. This needs to be determined;it is important to establish whether fecundity is driven by foodcharacteristics, and to incorporate this critical linkage in models.This component of TASC will interact strongly with the proposedfield programme, by providing key analytical and shipboard (weathership"M") experimental input to TASC cruises, and also bytesting, under defined laboratory conditions, critical hypothesesgenerated by the field programme. Methodology: Controlled culture experiments under defined regimeswill be combined with detailed lipid and molecular analysis, andpopulation dynamics and modelling. SUBTASK 13: Latitudinal differencesin population dynamics: Mesocosm studies PI: Benni Hansen (bhansen@virgil.ruc.dk) Objective: Identify the environmental cues governing the lifecycle pattern along a latitudinal gradient from 60oto 70o N along the Norwegiancoast. Scientific rationale. A two year cultivation study of C. finmarchicusfrom eggs to adults will be conducted. We will compare and contrastresponses in growth pattern, developmental and mortality schedulesto variations in physical settings among cohorts from two geographicallydistinct populations. These populations should potentially havedifferent history and physiological adaptations. Eggs from a northern(Grøtsund, 70 oN)and from a southern population (Trondheimsfjorden, 63 oN)will be obtained at the two sites, and brought to one mesocosmsite. We will perform two such experiments - one in 1996 and onein 1997. The hatched nauplii, from the two sites, will be raisedin triplicates, in parallel mesocosm in the northern site duringthe first year, and in the southern site during the next year.The mesocosms will be run for the period from March to June/July.The Ho hypothesis willthus be that there is no differences in growth pattern, developmentaland mortality schedules among the two geographical distinct populationsof C. finmarchicus. Methodology: Cylindric mesocosms (50 m3)arranged around a platform nearby Kårvika Research Stationin Tromsø, will be filled with FSW, and stocked with Calanuseggs, and a composite natural phytoplankton community, generatedfrom spores in sediment samples form the area. After Day 30 additionalstocks of flagellates will be added in order ensure a high qualitydiet for the intensive growth period during the copepodite stages(see Berggreen et al. 1988; Hansen et al. 1994). Light conditionsin the mesocosms will be set equal to 10 m of depth by maintaininga light filtering net on to of each mesocosm. The food conditions,temperature and salinity will be monitored daily. Parameters liketemperature, chlorophyll, particulare organic carbon (Infra RedGas Analyser), C/N, species composition of phytoplankton and microzooplanktonwill be monitored weekly. Copepod samples will be obtained weeklyby a plankton net (100 and 180 mmmesh), staged, weighed and stored for later lipid analysis. Sexdifferentiation, signs of diapause entry and the degree of moultingsuccess to a second generation will be studied by gonad examinationof the cohorts under study. SUBTASK 14: Modelling growth,reproduction and life cycle PI: Francois Carlotti (carlotti@ccrv.obs-vlfr.fr) Objectives: Based on the laboratory, mesocosm and field results,to model region specific growth and egg production patterns andlife cycles, and investigate population synchrony with circle-mapmodelling. Scientific rationale:To understand life cycle strategy and estimate production of copepods,we must know the common characteristics of growth and developmentfor the individuals of the same population and the sources oftheir variability. Models coupling the physiological approachwith stage structure and mortality as developed by Carlotti &Sciandra (1989) enable the dynamics of all the developmental stages,in variable conditions of food and temperature, to be simulated.Despite numerous experiments on the physiological processes ofcopepods (ingestion, metabolism, growth) and on cohort development,the links between growth (biomass increase) and development (stageprogression) are not fully understood (TASC Report). The experimentalwork proposed in the previous two subtasks will provide an opportunity,using the data generated, to address the outstanding questionof model calibration. Modelling will also be a synthetic tooltesting hypotheses on Calanus population dynamics resultingfrom the laboratory, mesocosm and field studies. To develop a life cycle model compatible with thecomputational demands of operation in tandem with a particle trackingdispersal model, an alternative approach is also necessary. Deterministicand stochastic models to predict the optimal seasonal time forentry and exit of diapause in species which can only overwinterin diapause have been available for some time. These tend to beparameter rich. Gurney et al. (1992) explored the use of circle-mapmodels, a method used in mechanics modelling, to investigate populationsynchrony for species with seasonal diapause. The models are parametersparse, and function by tracking generation lines, predictingsuccessive spawning times in relation to the periodicity of theforcing environmental signal - precisely the approach requiredto simulate reproduction in a particle tracking system. This methodhas shown that for insect taxa the size and timing of entry todiapause is critical for population persistence under seasonallyadverse conditions, whilst wide flexibility in the size and timeof diapause entry and exit is a feature allowing colonisationof a wide latitudinal range. For example, tropical insect specieswhich succeed in colonising temperate environments. In C. finmarchicusthe diapause stage is relatively extended in the open ocean (3-5months). In insects this commonly results in high degree of populationsynchrony. The use of circle-map models seems appropriate forinvestigate this life-cycle aspect. Methodology: Existing models will be further developed, and appliedto the life history strategy of C.finmarchicus.

INVESTIGATORS: Bent Hansen Hygum Roskilde University, Institute for Life science and Chemistry, Denmark hygum@virgil.ruc.dk Benni Hansen Roskilde University, Institute for Life science and Chemistry, Denmark bhansen@virgil.ruc.dk Catherine Rey Observatoire des Sciences de l�Univers, Universit� Paris, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France rey@ccrv.obs-vlfr.fr Francois Carlotti Observatoire des Sciences de l�Univers, Universit� Paris, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France carlotti@ccrv.obs-vlfr.fr Kurt Tande The Norwegian College of Fishery Science University of Troms�, Norway ktande@nfh.uit.no MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental set-up. An experiment with three enclosures was carried out between 9 March and 9 May 1996, at the Marine Biological Field Station, Bergen, Norway. The enclosures had a diameter of 2 m, 7 m deep and contained 18.5 m3 water. They were made of polyethylene which has 90 % light transmission. The enclosures were installed around a raft with a small floating laboratory. Each enclosure was filled by pumping water through a 50 um plankton net from 1.5 m depth in the fjord on 9 March. Due to a less successful screening procedure also unscreened water was introduced to the bags. An airlift system was installed to keep the watermass insidethe enclosures in circulation. Nutrients were added to the bags, at equal N-Si-P ratios, three times during the experimental period. The nutrients, nitrate (NaNO3), silicate (Na2SiO3) and phosphate (K2HPO4) were supplied from stock solutions. The water in the enclosures was notrenewed during the experimental period. Collection of females Female C. finmarchicus were collected in the Ravnefjorden using a 1.5 m diameter net with a mesh of 500 um. Samples were taken at 50, 80, or 100 m during vertical hauls, or 5, 50 or 100 m for 15 mins, while the ship was drifting. The eggs were collected following two methods: The first method, the whole samples were transferred directly to 100 l containers bubbled with air. In the second method, females were sorted into plastic cylinders with a 300 um mesh bot-tom and suspended in a 40 l aquarium. The time between capture and start of incubation was usually under 3 h. In the two methods, the eggs were extracted after 24 hours by siphoning and transferred to 4 l beakers. The numbers of nauplii were recorded 2-3 days after egg incubation,and the nauplii were stored for 1 to 10 days in beakers. Then, the nauplii were transferred to 2 enclosures, A and B. A new estimation of the total number of nauplii was made just prior to injection to the enclosures (Table 1). Therefore, the initial cohort of nauplii was a combination of stage NI and NII for each enclosure. Stage NIII may also have been present in enclosure A. Enclosure C represent the natural mesozooplankton community which were not removed during the pre-screening procedure of the enclosure water. Table I. Initial concentration of nauplii in enclosure A and B. Date of nauplii incubation Enclosure No. of nauplii Age of nauplii (d) 27 March, 1996 2 April, 1996 4 April, 1996 8 April, 1996 A B B B ~25.000 ~5.000 ~13.000 ~6.000 3 to 10 5 to 9 3 to 5 2 to 7 Sampling. The enclosures were sampled during the period 23 March - 9 May. Samples from the meso-cosms representing 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 meters depth were conducted with a 3-litre heart-valve water sampler and pooled in a container. Subsamples from the container were selected for the chemical and biological measurements. Temperature and salinity were measured every second day Ph was measured directly in the water-sampler in the depth intervals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 meter. Nutrients. Samples for the determination of nutrient concentration were immediately frozen after sam-pling (- 18 oC) and will be analysed on an automatic nutrient analyser. Chlorophyll a. Samples of 1 to 2 l for chl a measurements were filtered onto Whatman GF/C (47 mm) filters. Filtration started 1 hour after collection and the samples were spectrophotome-tric determined in ethanol extract on a Novaspec II Spectrophotometer. Fractionated Chl a < 10 um was measured in the water after gentle inverted filtration through a 10 um screen. CHN. Samples of 1 to 2 l for CHN measurements were filtered onto muffled Whatman GF/C (47 mm) filters. The filter was wrapped in muffled aluminium foil and stored at - 18�C. Bacteria, nanoflagellates and ciliates. Samples for measurements of abundance of bacteria, auto- and heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates were taken every second day. Microzooplankton. Production (< 200 um) experiments were conducted every fourth day. Two samples represen-ting each mesocosm was gently collected from the pooled water samples by inverted filtration through a 200 um net every fourth day. The screened water was decanted to 2 l Nalgene bottles and mounted on a plankton wheel (speed: 4 rpm) for 24 and 48 h incubation, at in situ tempe-rature and dim light. Growth rate was determinated in each experiment. Mesozooplankton. The Calanus stocks in the bags were monitored every fourth day by plankton net hauls. 100 um mesh samples were analysed for copepod abundance and stage development, growth in terms of length, growth in terms of carbon and nitrogen content; lipid deposition during developmental stages and gonad development. To distinguish between the different nauplii and copepodite developmental stages, length criteria after Unstad and Tande (1991) and number of urosome segments was used for copepodits and body length. The numbers and arrangements of the spines at the posterior end of the body was used for the nauplii. Preliminary results and experience The experimental set-up seems to be very suitable for studying C. finmarchicus cohorts. During our 50 days experimental period the animals has developed from early nauplii to latecopepodits. Mature males and females was also observed during the latest sampling days. For the experiments in 1997 we are planning to introduce OPC-techniques to monitor the popula-tion and density, and thereby improve our data on mortality rates among the developmental stages of C. finmarchicus cohorts. ------------------------------------ PRELIMINARY PLANS FOR TASC MESOCOSM EXPERIMENTS IN BERGEN, MARCH - MAY 1997 Locality: Marinbiological Fieldstation, Espelandsvej 232, 5065 Blomsterdalen, Norway. EObservatoire des Sciences de l�Univers, Universit� Paris, Villfranche-sur-Mer, France carlotti@ccrv.obs-vlfr.fr Objectives. Based on our experince from the mesocosm set-up in Bergen in spring 96 we found that the experimental set-up was suitable for studying C. finmarchicus cohorts. During the 50 days experimental period in 1996 the animals developed from early nauplii to late copepodits. Mature males and females were also observed during the latest sampling days. The mesocosm set-up in 1997 will provides an opportunity to study: Copepod abundance and stage development. Copepod growth in terms of carbon and nitrogen content Lipid deposition during developmental stages Mortality estimations based on OPC Gonad development Effect of light on entry to diapause Biomass and production of phytoplankton, Fractionated chlorophyll and CHN Biomass and production of bacteria, Biomass of heterotrofhic nanoflagellates, Biomass of ciliates. Logistics. The research vessel "Hans Brattst�m" will be reserved in week 11 and 12.Three fjords will be monitored for standing stock of Calanus females (Ravnefjorden, Korsfjorden, Lurefjorden). The best locality will be chosen and females will be catched by a special designed Beam-trawl or alternative WP2-nets in oversize. Kurt Tande is responsible for development of the beam-trawl. Samples from the plankton net hauls willbe sorted immediately on board the vessel and Calanus females will be placed in containers in dark. Four TASC participants will be on boardthe vessel ca. 10 hour per day in 4-5 days during this activity. We expect to sort out 5,000 females per day. If we succeed with the beam-trawl, we may save time on the sea. Mesocosm set-up. The mesocosms will be installed on the raft during week 10. Five mesocosms ( 2 m in diameter and 7 m depth = volume 18.5 m3) will be installed. We need 5 rafts supporting the mesocosms and four pontoons between the rafts. Air lift systems will be installed in all bags controlled by one pump. The mesocosms will be filled with pre-screened water (< 50 um). The set-up of the mesocosms involves two TASC participants in four days. Laboratory set-up for treatments of females. A double container system will be used, where females are placed in the inner container and eggs can sediment out through a 300 umnets placed in the bottom of the inner container. In this way egg canibalism should be reduced.

Hydrographic measurements 1.1 CTD. A 12 pp manual is available presenting a) Procedure for identification and logging of the state ofCTD systems, salinometers and water water sampling equipment b) Procedure for handling of CTD systems and water samplingbottles (f.ex. Niskin bottles) c) Procedure for transfer of standards for measuring temperature,conductivity, and pressure d) Procedure for field calibration of CTD-systems e) Procedure for transfer of calibration data to data files Data on temperature and salinity will be collected with CTD (SeaBird or Neil Brown) or water sampling bottles (Nansen or Niskinbottles) equipped with reversing termometers. Calibration is carriedout according to the IMR standard and involves the taking of salinitysamples for calibration at each station. The CTDs used at IMRat present are Neil Brown Instrument Systems, NBIS MkIII, andSea-Bird's 911plus 1.2 ADCP R/V «Johan Hjort» and «G.O.Sars» are equippedwith ADCP model R.D.Instruments RD-VM 150 kHz. The instrumentis operated according to the IMR protocol. 2 . Nutrient measurements Water for nutrient analyses is sampled by a rosette system carriedon the CTDs, and on deck collected into 20 ml polyethylene vials,added 0.2 ml chloroform and kept refrigerated at 4oC in the darkuntil analysis is carried out. Nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, andsilicic acid are analysed using standard methods (Strickland andParsons, 1972) adapted to an autoanalyzer (Føyn et al.,1981). Equipment improvements in relation to the 1981-paper aremainly new autosampling, detection and computing units from SANplusSegmented Flow Analyzer, Skalar Analytic B.V., the Netherlands.Also a new modification has been applied in the analysis of nitrate.The Cd-reduction column has been replaced by a Cd-tube manufacturedby Alpkem Inc. and the segmentation of the flow was achieved bypumping nitrogen gas instead of air as in the previous versionof the method. The precision of the analyses has been monitored by running tenfresh replicate samples from a single Niskin bottle several timesduring some cruises. The precision obtained for the differentanalyses at full scale was better than 0.1% for nitrite, 0.25%for nitrate, 0.5% for phosphate and 0.2% for silicic acid. The reproducibility of the analyses has been assessed by runningonboard a set of control samples which were newly made every dayfrom stock solutions prepared ashore. The control samples wereprepared in low nutrient sea water and were run in the same wayas the other samples. The obtained reproducibility for a particularcruise (one standard deviartion) for the different analyses usuallyis as follows: Nitrite: 0.39% at a level of about 0.5 µmol l-1 Nitrate: 1.14% at a level of about 8.1 µmol l-1 0.50% at a level of about 18 µmol l-1 Phosphate: 1.16% at a level of about 0.66 µmol l-1 0.52% at a level of about 1.25 µmol l-1 Silicate: 0.36% at a level of about 4.5 µmol l-1 0.10% at a level of about 11 µmol l-1 References: Føyn,L., M.

Measurements for chlorohyll a and primary production 3.1 Chlorophyll a and paheopigments Water samples for chlorophyll a (263 Ï 3ml) are filteredthrough glassfiber filters (GF/F) and kept frozen (-18 oC) fora maximum period of four weeks until analysis ashore. In the laboratorythe filters are extracted overnight with 10 ml of 90% acetonein the dark and at 4oC. Periodic shaking assures a complete extraction.The extracts are then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 5000 g andmeasured fluorometrically with a Turner Designs 10 AU-R (exicationfilter CS 2-60; emission filter CS 2-64) both before and afteracidification with one drop of 5% v/v hydrochloric acid. The fluorometeris calibrated against a pure chlorophyll a (Sigma Inc) extractwhich concentration is measured spectrophotometrically using theequations of Jeffrey and Humphrey (1985). The final calculationsof chlorophyll a and phaeopigments are done using the equationsproposed by Lorenzen (1966). References: Jeffrey, S.W. and G.F.

Samples (120 ml) are obtained at 9 light depths from Niskinbottles, poured carefully into class bottles, added redioactivecarbon ( ¸ 4µCi per sample) and incubated for 24 hours.The samples are then filtrated through membrane filters (0.45µm pore size) and kept frozen into scintillation vials untilanalysis ashore. In the laboratory the sampels are fumed for 30minutes under concentrated hydrochloric acid, added scintillationcocktail (Optima Gold) and then measured in a Packard Tri-Carbscintillation meter using the channel ratio method for correctingfor quenching. 4. Collecting zooplankton 4.1 Sampling devices 4.1.1 MOCNESS 1m2 A description of the MOCNESS (Multiple Opening Closing Net andEnvironmental Sensing System) is given in Wiebe et al.(1976, 1985).Calibration of the TSK (Tsurumi-Seiki-flowmeters takes place atthe start of each cruise, following a protocol at IMR. The MOCNESSis usually equipped with 8 nets (180 µm mesh size). In routinesurveys the MOCNESS is used to 700 m depth, by oblique hauls thefollowing depth intervals are sampled net 1 700- 500 m (0r bottom -500 m at shallower depths) " 2 500-400 m " 3 400-300 m " 4 300-200 m " 5 200-100 m " 6 100-50 m " 7 50-25 m " 8 25-0 m At shallower echo depths the number of nets in use is usuallyreduced accordingly.

The nets are usuallyneither euipped with closing mechanisms nor flowmeters. Both closingdevices and flowmeters (TSK or General Oceanics) can be mountedif so desired. The WP-2 net is towed vertically from the desireddepth and up to the surface at a speed of c. 30 m min-1. 4.1.3 Multinet (Multi plankton sampler) The Multinet is an opening/closing net equipped with five nets180 µm mesh. The mouth opening is 0.25 m2. At present thedevice is not equipped with flowmeters. The MPS is towed by amulticonductor cable and the nets changings are controlled witha Deck Command Unit from on board the ship. For depth informationa Scanmar pressure sensor unit is mounted on the Multinet, i.e.the depth is read from the Scanmar deck unit on board the ship.At IMR the Multinet is towed vertically from about 1000 m to surface,at a speed of c. 30 m min -1. Within the TASC project we wouldprefer using the Multinet to at least 2000 m depth, dependingupon finance another cable might be provided. 4.1.4 Plankton pumps A small ITT Flygt pump ( FLYGT GP 51, capacity c. 100 l min-1at lifting height 6 m) is used for collecting copepod naupliiat disrete depths down to about 50 m. The pump is connected toa filtering system on board the ship, where the water is filteredover 90 µm mesh for retaining copepod (i.e. Calanus finmarchicus)nauplii. Usually a 26 liter water sample is filtered from eachdepth. 4.1.5 Niskin water bottles Small organisms (copepod nauplii) are commonly sampled by meansof Niskin water bottles, size 5 and 30 liters. The filtering takesplace in a net placed within a large jar on deck. With this rathersimple equipment samples may be taken from any depth irrespectiveof hose lenghts, pressure allowance of pumps etc. 5. The treatment of zooplankton samples 5.1 Samples for biomass estimation At once the sample is on deck scyphozoans, ctenophores etc. areremoved, identified, and measured (volume). The remaining sampleis parted into two equal parts (Motoda plankton splitter). Onehalf is preserved in 4 % formaldehyde, the other part is partedinto size fractions by filtering through 2000 µm, 1000 µmand 180 µm sieves. From the 2000 µm fraction large organismsas euphausiids, fish, and shrimps are removed and measured (length).The three different size fractions, euphausiids, fishes, and shrimpsare transferred to preweighed alumina trays and dried for 20 hoursat 70 oC, before weighing using a Cahn microbalance. 5.2. Samples for RNA/DNA analyses - lipid analyses Samples are carried out on live material, usually from MOCNESS.Single animals are identified and length measured, transferredto cryotubes and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen or in a-80 oC freezer. During sorting (species and stage identification)the animals are kept in a cold stage by means of ice blocks. Incase of C. finmarchicus we use cop. stage IV and V. Thesame procedure is followed for lipid analyses. When analysingseveral specimens are pooled to obtain sufficient quantity forlipid analyses. 5.3 Samples for genetic analyses Live organisms are dried for excess seawater. In some cases apart of the MOCNESS sample is used without previous identificationof specimens, identification etc. takes place ashore at a laterstage. In other cases the live organisms are identified to speciesbefore further treatment. The organisms are transferred to smallglass bottles in 95% ethyl alcohol. After 24 hours the alcoholis drained off and replaced with fresh alcohol. The analysis takesplace ashore, at IMR. In case of C. finmarchcicus the analysesare performed on adult females.The total procedure is accordingto Ann Bucklin/Rolf Sundt. 5.4 Samples for taxonomic analyses Large gelatinous organisms are already removed and identifiedbefore preservation onboard the ship. The preserved sample isfiltrated on a 2000 µm sieve, large organisms as euphausiids,fish (usually lanternfish and pearlside), shrimps (usually Sergestesspp. and Pasiphaea spp), amphipods (usually Themisto spp.) areremoved identified, measured and counted. Except when the sampleis very small the remainder is then split a number of times witha Motoda splitter and a aliquot is identified for species or highertaxonomic groups. The splitting with the Motoda splitter usuallytakes place in two steps: 1) A moderate splitting with regardto the most important species ( priority 1) 2) A further splittingfor analysing the usually numerous smaller organisms (priority2) In priority 1 we usually split the total sample appropriate timesto ensure a sufficient numbers of Calanus finmarchicusin the final aliquot, at least 100 specimens. In priority 2 furthersplitting takes place so that the numerous smaller organisms likecopepod nauplii, Oithona etc. can be effectively enumerated andidentified. Most copepods in the sample are identified to species. C. finmarchicus,C.hyperboreus, C.glacialis are also indtified to cop.stages.Most other copepods (Metridia, Pseudocalanus, Euchaeta a.o.) areidentified to genus and cop.stage, while in routine surveys crustaceannauplii are identified to class. At present C. finmarchicusand C. glacialis are separated by means of length frequencydistributions, however, since they to some extent overlap in size,attemps are now made to discriminate between the species by geneticanalyses. C. helgolandicus is rather scarce in our waters,no attempts have been made to discriminate between C. finmarchicusand C. helgolandicus. Other organisms are identified to class or family; euphausiidsand some amphipods also to species. The above mentioned procedures constitute a brief extract of severalprotocols or manuals at IMR, of which most are written in Norwegianonly.

On that meeting I was asked to collate the different methods protocols for TASK 1 and on the following pages I have assembled these from all the partners in Task 1 (i.e. DIFRES, FLL, MLA, MRI, UIT�) and brought them together into one document of recommended Task 1 procedures. At the meeting in Trondheim it became obvious that for practical reasons we should never be able to standardise all our methods. Therefore, for many procedures more than one alternative for how to proceed is given, while for others I have tried not to be too specific. For some of the more simple things (i.e. net mesh) I do however propose a standardised procedure. For reasons of space I have kept some of the descriptions quite brief. Even though we will not be able to do all our sampling and sample analysis in exactly the same way I feel that it is most important for our partnership that we start off with a reasonable knowledge of each others methods. That is the purpose of this compilation. Please note that this is only a first draft. All comments, changes and modifications are welcomed. The protocols are given below: 1. Hydrographic measurements 1.1 CTD Data on temperature and salinity will be collected with a CTD (Sea Bird Electronics SBE-9 or Neil Brown). Calibration is carried out according to standards of the different institutes and involves the taking of salinity samples for calibration at each station. When a CTD is not available, Nansen casts may provide data on temperature and salinity. 1.2 ADCP Data on currents will be obtained by either a 150 kHz (UIT�) or a 600 kHz (MLA/DIFRES) ADCPs, giving a typical maximum measurement depth of 400 and 80 m respectively. These instruments are operated according to protocols of the respective institutes. 2. Nutrient measurements Seawater samples (c. 250 ml) for nutrient analysis will be collected from the surface layer, quick frozen in plastic bottles and analysed ashore. The measurements will be done according to standard techniques (Strickland and Parsons 1968, Grasshoff et al. (eds.) 1983). 3. Measurements of chlorophyll a and primary production 3.1. In situ fluorescence Chlorophyll a fluorescence profiles will be obtained with a in situ fluorometer (Sea Tec or similar) fitted on the CTD rosette. For each cruise the fluorometer is calibrated with extracted in situ chlorophyll. 3.2. Chlorophyll a Seawater samples (1-2 l) for the measurement of chlorophyll a will be collected from several depths in the surface layer and filtered through GF/C (MRI) or GF/F (MLA/DIFRES) glass fibre filters (some partners add MgCO3 (MRI, FLL)). The filters are homogenised in 90% aqueous acetone after which the extract is measured spectrophotometrically. 3.3. Primary production At MRI the standard procedure is to measure primary production at light saturation by short term (4 hour) Carbon-14 incubations (200-250 uE m-2 s-2) of samples collected at four standard depths (0, 10, 20, 30 m). At selected stations these measurements may be supplemented with incubations at a range of light intensities. Depth integrated production of the water column (mgCm-2 d-1) is calculated according to a modified equation of Steemann-Nielsen (1952). The MLA/DIFRES protocol involves short term (4h) incubations at a range of light intensities from which a P/I relationship can be constructed. Water for incubation is collected by a SEABIRD CTD-Rosette system from at least two depths per station. The rate of primary production (mgCm-2 sea surface) is reconstructed from the vertical distribution of chlorophyll (measured by a fluorometer on the CTD), the vertical attenuation coefficient of irradiance (measured by a quantum sensor on the CTD), and the relationship between carbon fixation per unit chlorophyll and irradiance derived from the incubations. 4. Collecting zooplankton 4.1. Life sampling Live zooplankton will be collected with a WP-2 net (or similar gear) (200-250 um mesh), fitted with a nonfiltering cod end (2-8 l). The net is towed vertically from c. 50 m to the surface with a speed of 0.3 m s-1. On retrieval the contents of the cod-end are gently emptied into a c. 10-20 l container filled with seawater collected from the surface layer. The plankton that remain attached to the net are considered to be damaged and are therefore discarded. 4.2. Quantitative sampling The main emphasis will be on obtaining discrete samples from the different layers of the water column. However, occasionally these will be supplemented with depth integrated samples from the whole or a part of the water column. 4.2.1. Depth-integrated sampling Depth-integrated samples will be obtained either with a Bongo net or a WP-2 net, both having 200 um mesh. These should be equipped with flowmeters to measure the volume of water filtered by the nets. The Bongo nets should be towed obliquely from the surface to the desired depth and back to the surface while the ship cruises at c. 2.5 knots. Payout and retrieval rates should be c. 10 m min-1. The WP-2 net is towed vertically from the desired depth and up to the surface at a speed of c. 45 m min-1. 4.2.2. Depth-stratified sampling To obtain depth stratified samples three gears will be used. These are the Multi Plankton Sampler MPS Type B from Hydro-Bios (MRI), the ARIES (MLA/DIFRES) and the MOCNESS (UIT�). The maximum operation depth of the MPS and the ARIES is 3000 m while that of the MOCNESS is 1000 m. Below follows a brief description of the operation and the main specifications of each gear. Multi Plankton Sampler MPS Type B (MPS) (MRI) The MPS is an opening and closing net sampler equipped with five nets of 200 um mesh. The mouth opening is 0.25 m2 and he volume of water filtered by the nets is monitored with mechanical flow meters fitted in each net. The MPS is towed by a multiconductor cable and the net changings are controlled with a Deck Command Unit from on board the ship. The instrument is fitted with a pressure sensor and the depth is read from the Deck Command Unit. The MPS can be towed both vertically and horizontally, and the towing speed is c. 40 m min-1. The number of depth strata which will be sampled will vary according to bottom depth and hydrographic conditions but we foresee that it will be necessary to carry out successive vertical tows at several of the stations. ARIES (MLA, DIFRES) ARIES comprises the following in a single towing vehicle: 1) a LHPR type system, 2) an Optical Plankton Counter, 3) a water sampling rosette, 4) two integrating plankton nets, 5) a CTD system. The system is semi-autonomous, being battery powered and having an onboard computer which holds data in RAM during the tow. Thus it does not depend on conducting tow cable. It is towed on 16 mm plain steel wire, real time depth being obtained from an acoustic trawl headline pressure sensor attached to the sampler (SCANMAR). Ascent and descent rate is controlled by adjusting the ship speed and winch speed to achieve 20 m/min for tows of maximum depth >500 m, and 10m/min for shallower tows. 1) Serial net sampler: The LHPR type unit has a single concentrating net (200 um, 30 cm mouth diameter) and a series of integrating cod-ends which step past the tail of the net on a time interval basis. At the same time, data from a calibrated flowmeter in the mouth of the net and a pressure sensor are stored in RAM. Communications with the onboard computer for setup and downloading data before and after deployment is by serial cable from a PC. The logged data are merged with navigational data recorded at 60 sec intervals aboard the ship during the tow to produce a listing and set of labels for each sample giving the time, lat/long, depth and volume filtered for each sample. A typical setup would have flow and pressure data logged at 2 sec intervals and sample integration period of 120 sec. Thus, each sample would represent a 40 m depth layer in tows deeper than 500 m, or a 20 m layer in shallower tows. The integration period is user selected from a menu system and may be in the range 1-60 minutes. At present, the system allows for a maximum of 110 samples to be collected in a single deployment. On recovery of the sampler, samples are washed out of the individual cod-ends onto 200 um mesh squares, and the whole mesh and sample preserved in 4% borax buffered formaldehyde in dram glass vials. 2) Optical Plankton Counter: A standard Focal Technology OPC is mounted near the mouth opening of the plankton concentrating net, in clear water flow. The system has been modified from that sold commercially to allow self-recording. The data logger integrates the raw data coming from the OPC in real time according to user defined parameters of time period and sizeclass intervals. Typically, the system is configured to integrate particle counts over 120 size classes over the range 100-5000 microns, in 60 sec time intervals. As with the net sampler, data are stored in RAM by a controlling computer and downloaded to a PC at the end of the tow. 3) Rosette system: The ARIES frame also carries a water sampling rosette having 60 bottles of 200 ml each. The system closes a bottle at the end of every plankton net integration period. In a standard deployment, a subsample for nutrient analysis would be taken from each bottle, a sample for salinity analysis from the deepest bottle and from one in the upper 50 m, and a sample for chlorophyll analysis from one bottle in the upper 50 m. 4) Integrating plankton nets: Two small mouth aperture integrating plankton nets may be attached to the ARIES frame. These are housed in cyclindrical lattice frames which are easily removable for washing down. Typically, one net would have 200 um mesh and the other 68 um mesh. These simply integrate the plankton over the entire deployment and are included as quick overview samples. The intention of the 68 um mesh net is to collect egg and naupliar stages of Calanus for which there are very few data, but which are very important for modelling studies. 5) CTD sensors: A self recording SEABIRD SBE9-11 CTD is mounted in the ARIES frame, and includes beam attenuation, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence sensors. The fluorometer is calibrated from the water samples collected with the ARIES rosette - approx 200 ml of water from one bottle (known closure depth and time) are filtered through a GFF filter, pigments extracted in 90% acetone, and measured fluorometrically. A conductivity calibration of the CTD is derived for every cruise from the salinity analyses of water samples collected on each ARIES tow. CTD data are processed using the standard routines supplied by SEABIRD Electronics. MOCNESS (UIT�) The Mocness is a multiple opening and closing net sampling system carrying nine nets. The mouth opening is 1 m2 and the mesh size of the nets is 180 um. Opening and closing of nets is activated by commands from a deck unit through a conducting cable. Vertical hauling speed is 0.16 m/sec., horizontal speed is 0.6 m/sec, and flow is read with a mechanical flowmeter which is calibrated before each cruise. Depending on bottom depth, sampling will be made in 3-8 depth intervals. 4.2.3. Sampling eggs and nauplii 30 l of seawater, sampled from 0.5-3 meters depth is filtered through a 30 um mesh net (FLL). The sample is preserved in 4% formalin and in the laboratory ashore the nauplii are staged and counted. 5. Treatment of samples At completion of a tow all nets should be washed thoroughly so that the samples fall down into the corresponding buckets. In the ship's laboratory the samples may then be split with a Motoda splitter in order to have samples for various purposes. The material obtained by ARIES is usually not split. 5.1. Samples for abundance estimationThe fraction intended for species identification, enumeration and the staging of C. finmarchicus is preserved in 4% formalin neutralised with Borax (at UIT� they add the bactericide 1.5-propane-diol).5.2. Samples for biomass estimation The fraction for obtaining dry weight biomass for both the entire sample and individual animals is frozen (i.e. on pre weighed aluminium dishes) at -20 �C or lower. The dry weight procedure involves drying the samples for 20 hours at 70�C after which they are weighed on an electromicrobalance with high sensitivity (i.e. Mettler AE 240 or Cahn C-31). 5.3. Samples for lipid analysis Sampling is best carried out on live haul material, but the catch from for instance ARIES is frequently of sufficiently good quality. Specimens are routinely saved from different depth layers from every ARIES deployment. The material is sorted on a cold stage, and 10 animals transferred to cryotubes which are flushed with nitrogen gas before storage in liquid nitrogen or in a -80 oC freezer. 5.4. Samples for elemental analysis (CHN) and enzyme analysis Animals frozen in liquid nitrogen are used for elemental analysis (CHN) and enzyme analysis of selected copepodite stages. 5.5. Samples for genetic analysis The following procedure is according to Ann Bucklin: 1. Drain samples for excess seawater (over nitex of the same size or smaller as net collection). 2. Place zooplankton in round-sided glass bottle and add 95% ethyl alcohol; there must be 3 to 4 times more alcohol than plankton by volume; NB. DENATURATION ALCOHOL CAN NOT BE USED FOR SAMPLE PRESERVATION. 3. After 24 hours, drain off alcohol and replace with fresh alcohol. 4. Ensure frequent curation after the cruise and for the duration of storage to avoid evaporation or decomposition of the sample. 6. Taxonomic analysis of preserved zooplankton Complete faunal analysis: Initially gelatinous zooplankton are removed from the samples and their displacement volume measured. The larger animals (euphausiids, amphipods, caridea and fish larvae) are then removed and counted from whole samples. Except when the sample is very small the remainder is then split a number of times with a Motoda splitter and an aliquot containing at least 500 individuals analysed for species or higher taxonomic groups. Further, from each sample at least 200 individuals of C. finmarchicus are classed to developmental stages. Analysis limited to Calanus spp. plus perhaps a few other key species (e.g. Sagitta, Oithona) (MLA, DIFRES). The following applies to the analysis of ARIES samples. The aim is to identify and stage a maximum of 400 Calanus specimens per sample. Subsampling is only carried out if the sample contains >400 specimens (most individual ARIES samples are relatively small, but there are very many of them). Both C.finmarchicus and C.helgolandicus are commonly present in samples from the North Sea and the southern Norwegian Sea. No attempt is made to discriminate the two on a routine basis for stage V or below, nor for stage VI males. BEFORE any subsampling is performed, 20 stage VI female Calanus are removed and examined to discriminate C.finmarchicus and C.helgolandicus. These specimens are then replaced in the sample. Other Calanus species found on a reasonably regular basis are C.hyperboreus and C. tenuicornis. Subsampling is performed by making the sample up to 200 ml in a cylinder and removing 4x5ml with a Stempel pipette. 7. Determining egg production rate The catch from a life tow is gently diluted and transferred into c. 10- 20 l plastic bucket. From this bucket samples are immediately taken with a large pipette and transferred to Petri dishes where females in good condition are sorted out using a stereomicroscope with cold stage and a pipette. The females are then placed into egg production chambers or glass bottles pre-filled with sieved surface water (50 um). One female (FLL: two) is added to each chamber/bottle and if possible 10 replicates should be done per station. The egg production chambers (MRI, FLL) are of perspex and have a volume of approximately 0.6-1 l with a 300-500 um mesh near the bottom separating adult females from the eggs to reduce cannibalism (Steve Hay's set-up). For incubation the chambers are placed into a container situated in a shaded area on deck and with flowing surface water. Incubation time is 24hours. A black plastic sheet may be placed over the container to prevent excessive light from entering. Incubations are carried out at ambient sea temperatures. The glass bottles (MLA, DIFRES) have a volume of 0.5-1 l. The incubations are carried out in a constant temperature room at approximately the ambient surface water temperature. Illumination is periodic, with a daylength 1 hour shorter that at the time of year of the cruise, with dim light only during the light period. The bottles are not agitated during the incubations, but placed upright in plastic boxes Incubations are terminated after 24 hours by filtering onto a 20 um screen on which the eggs are counted immediately under a stereomicroscope. The eggs show up clearly on the dry 20 um screen. The incubated female is measured (cephalothorax length) and preserved in 4 % formaldehyde. Fecundity is expressed as the number of eggs produced per hour and day 8. Measurement of gut fluorescence The cod-end contents from a live tow are gently rinsed on 200 um sieve with filtered seawater (1 um) to remove debris and any cells that may adhere to the animals. In doing this care is taken to keep the sieve submerged at all times. The sample is then placed in a Petri dish (MRI) or a cryotube (MLA, DIFRES), wrapped in aluminium foil, and frozen immediately(-20�C or lower). Further analysis is made in the laboratory on land within one month of collection. If gut evacuation experiments are to be carried out only a subsample is frozen (t=0 min). The rest of the sample is then transferred gently to a 50 l container filled with filtered seawater. The container is placed in a water bath with approximately the ambient temperature from which the animals were collected. Subsequent subsampling from the container takes place at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 240 minutes after collection. To obtain a value on background fluorescence a final sample is taken after 24 hours. In the laboratory on land a portion of the contents of the Petri dish is allowed to thaw for 5-10 minutes in the dark. Ten individuals of C. finmarchicus are then pickled out under dim light and placed in small test tubes with 5 ml of 90% acetone (at least 5 replicates). The tubes are then capped and left for 10-20 hours in a refrigerator for extraction (MLA/DIFRES: 1.0-1.5 hours). As to if the samples are homogenised there are different procedures among the partners. MRI do not homogenise the samples while MLA/DIFRES do homogenise with ultrasound. According to Simrad et al. (1985), Kleppel et al. (1988) and Morales et al. (1990) this is however not necessary. The fluorescence of the extract is measured before and after acidification with 10% HCl in a Turner Designs Model 10 Fluorometer, which is calibrated with pure chlorophyll a (MRI: Product number C5753 from Sigma Chemical Company). Gut pigment content is calculated using the modified formulas of Strickland and Parsons (1968) for in vitro fluorometry, adjusted for volume acetone and number of animals used in the extraction. The results are expressed as total gut pigment content (chlorophyll a equivalent), i.e. the sum of chlorophyll a and phaeopigment concentrations in the gut. Ingestion rates are calculated according to the formula I = S R, where S is the mean gut pigment (ng chlorophyll a equivalents ind-1) and R is the gut evacuation rate constant(time-1) as estimated from the gut evacu-ation experiments. 9.

Subtask 12: Culture experiments on nutrition, growth and reproduction Subtask 13: Latitudinal differences in population dynamics: Mesocosm studies Subtask 14: Modelling growth, reproduction and life cycle TASK 1: THE ROLE OF CROSS SHELFEXCHANGE PROCESSES IN CONTROLLING SEASONAL POPULATION DYNAMICS PI: Mike Heath (heathmr@31G.dnet.marlab.ac.uk) Objective: The primary objective of the Task is to examine therole of NSDW in a) facilitating colonisation of the temperatenortheast Atlantic rim ecosystem by C. finmarchicus whichis essentially a sub-Arctic species in terms of its global distribution,and b) potentially providing a link or teleconnection betweenthe various ecosystems thereby leading to a degree of synchronyin their responses to climatic forcing. Scientific rationale:The ability of C. finmarchicus to colonise repeatedly thenorthern North Sea ecosystem during the spring and summer is hypothesisedto be in part a consequence of the overflow of Norwegian Sea DeepWater (NSDW) through the Faroe-Shetland Channel into the Atlantic,and the propensity for C. finmarchicus to accumulate andoverwinter in this water mass (Backhaus et al, 1994). The juxtapositionof the Faroe-Shetland Channel and the northwest European shelfis such that a high proportion of copepodites emerging from depthin the spring are assured of successful colonisation of the NorthSea under a range of weather conditions, whilst the deep verticalmigration of late stage copepodites washed out of the North Seain the autumn will return at least a part of the population tothe NSDW for overwintering. The extension of this hypothesis tobe addressed in this Task is that a similar association betweenC.finmarchicus and NSDW operates along the mid-shelf westof Norway, on Faroe Plateau, and along the southern and southwesterncoast of Iceland. If this is the case then correlated trends inthe seasonal dynamics of C. finmarchicus in each of thesesystems may be explained in terms of ocean scale circulation patterns. SUBTASK 1: Overwintering, acrossshelf advection and spring spawning in Shetland-Faroe and southeasternIcelandic waters PI: Katherine Richardsson (kr@dfu.min.dk) Objective: The objectives of the subtask are to a) track theNSDW overflow between Faroe Bank and Faroe Plateau, across theIceland-Faroe Ridge, and along the shelf edge off southern Iceland,and to determine the association between this water and overwinteringC.finmarchicus, and b) to determine the routes for invasionof these shelf ecosystems by C.finmarchicus in the spring. Scientific rationale: Knowledge of the deep water circulation and overwinterdistribution of C. finmarchicus around the Greenland-ScotlandRidge is sketchy in some areas. The southerly flow of NSDW throughthe Faroe-Shetland Channel is only a small part of the outflowfrom the Norwegian and Greenland Seas into the North Atlantic.Most of the outflow is through the Denmark Strait west of Iceland.Further flows are found between Iceland and Faroe. NSDW in theFaroe-Shetland Channel rarely flows over the Wyville-Thomson Ridge,but mainly passes through the gap between Faroe-bank and FaroePlateau. Hydrodynamic considerations suggest that this water shouldconstitute a constrained deep plume flowing in a northwesterlydirection along the Atlantic face of the Iceland-Faroe Ridge whichwill be augmented by overflow across the Ridge. Such a featurehas been identified as a deep cold water mass along the slopeoff southern Iceland (Malmberg and Magnusson, 1982). The NSDWin the Faroe-Shetland Channel contains high concentrations (>100/m3)of stage V C. finmarchicus during the winter months. Ifthe water mass remains identifiable along the Atlantic face ofthe Ridge and off southern Iceland, then it is hypothesised thatC. finmarchicus will also be found in these areas duringthe winter. The modelling subtask (5) will be able to predictthe timing and location of spring invasions of the Faroese andsoutheastern Iceland shelf regions by C. finmarchicus originatingfrom such deep subsurface features, and thus sampling the distributionof animals in the spring will provide a valuable validation ofthe models and a comparative test of the generality of the Backhaushypothesis. Methodology: The campaign of field surveys will: a) map the distribution and physiology of Calanusin relation to hydrography in the winter (December-January) aroundthe Faroe plateau, Faroe Bank, the ridge between Faroe and Iceland,and along the southern shelf of Iceland. The specific objectiveof this campaign will be to establish the spatial extent of theassociation between C. finmarchicus and water of NorwegianSea origin which is expected to be found at depths >500m, andto track the overflow plume of NSDW along the Atlantic face ofthe Greenland-Scotland ridge. b) sampling of Calanus distribution and physiologyin the spring (February-April) in the area between Scotland andIceland. The specific objectives of this campaign will be firstto establish the specific localities where Calanus firstinvades the Faroe and Iceland continental shelves, and to confirmthe invasion pattern of the European Shelf detected during ICOS.Second, to determine the routes and rates of spreading from theshelf edge invasion area onto each of the shelf regions, and thedistribution of reproductive activity in relation to phytoplanktonactivity. c) collection of fine spatial scale hydrographicand vessel mounted acoustic doppler current profiler data on theshelf edge currents in the area to be covered by the hydrodynamicmodelling activity. Standard transects will be completed on each occasion,forming a baseline for intercomparison of data from the variouscampaigns, together with a more widespread network of samplinglocations covering the shelf margins. The "standard transects"will coincide with nationally established monitoring stationsin Icelandic, Faroese and UK shelf regions so that the data canbe viewed in the context of long-term variability in conditions.A critical component of the plankton sampling is the ability tocollect fine vertically resolved (20-40m) samples from depth downto 1000m, together with in-situ particle counts. Equipment toperform this task is already available in the project (MLA) andcan be deployed from a variety of survey vessels. SUBTASK 2: Overwintering, advection,and spring spawning south and southwest of Iceland PI: Astthor Gislason (astthor@hafro.is) Objective: a) To identify the overwintering sites of C. finmarchciussouth and southwest of Iceland. b) Describe the conditionand population structure of the overwintering populations in deepwater south and southwest of Iceland in late winter in relationto the physical and biological environment. c) Describe the ascentand advection of the overwintering animals onto the banks in latewinter, and their subsequent spawning, and how these are influencedby environmental factors. Scientific rationale: C.finmarchicus dominatesthe mesozooplankton in Icelandic waters as elsewhere in the NorthAtlantic (Conover 1988, Astthorsson et al. 1983, Astthorsson andGislason 1995), and it constitutes an important food for fishlarvae on the main spawning grounds of the commercially most importantIcelandic fish stocks (e.g cod, haddock, capelin) south and southwestof Iceland. The spring spawning of C. finmarchicus lastsfrom March to May, and there is both regional and between yearvariability in the timing of spring spawning in the area (Gislasonet al. 1994, Gislason and Astthorsson 1995). However, the reasonsfor this variability are not clear. Given that the year classstrength of the fish stocks is determined during the first feedingperiod this variability has large implications for the recruitmentto the fish stocks (Cushing 1990). The sea area south and southwestof Iceland (the Iceland Basin and the Irminger Sea) is probablyan important overwintering site for the Calanus stockssouthwest of Iceland and these regions may be of the same importanceas overwintering areas for Calanus in Icelandic watersas the Norwegian basin is for the stocks in Norwegian waters andthe Barents sea. However, a part of the stock may also overwinterover the shallower banks. No study exists which has been speciallydesigned to study the overwintering of Calanus south andsouthwest of Iceland, and the emergence and advection of overwinteredanimals onto the banks south and west of the island. Methodology: A comprehensive sampling of the horizontal and verticaldistribution of C. finmarchicus will be carried out inlate winter and spring 1996 and 1997 using vessels from MRI. Thesampling will be carried out on several cruises in 1996 (January-July)and 1997 (January-April). During each survey the sampling willbe conducted at standard sections south and southwest of Iceland.These transects are selected because they run across the mainspawning grounds and larval drift route of the major Icelandiccommercial fish stocks. Further, long term data (since 1971) onhydrography, phytoplankton production and zooplankton biomassare available from these transects, and to which the TASC-datacan be compared. Sampling gear: Hydrography: Seabird ElectronicsSBE-9 CTD. Phytoplankton: Sea-Tech Fluorometer, Transmissiometer,standard 14-C incubations Zooplankton: BIONESS multiple net samplingsystem. SUBTASK 3: Analysis of historicaltime series data PI: Ed McKenzie (ed@stams.strathclyde.ac.uk) Objective: To determine trends and seasonal cycles in abundanceof Calanus in different regions of the NE Atlantic andexamine evidence for correlations between regions, by extendingthe statistical time series analysis of data from the ContinuousPlankton Recorder (CPR) surveys carried out for the North Seaduring ICOS to include a wider area of the North Atlantic andNorwegian Sea, and draw this together with an analysis of historicaltime series data from Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian and Russiansources. Scientific rationale: Although dedicated field programmes can provide exceptionalinsight into the processes governing Calanus populationdynamics, they rarely give any indication of long term trendsor mean seasonal signals. Such information is vital for characterisingdifferent ecosystems and the similarities between them, and forrevealing the effects of long-term change. For this purpose, long-runningtime series data are required. The Continuous Plankton RecorderSurveys are a well known source of time series data for the NorthAtlantic and other oceans. Although sampling first started in1931 in the North Sea, routine sampling, which meets the standardsof present day procedures, commenced in 1946 with monthly resolutionalong a number of routes across the northeast Atlantic. Thesedata thus constitute a spatial time series extending in some localitiesover several decades and which can be used to make seasonal comparisonsbetween specific areas. Data therefore exist in the CPR databaseto compare off and on shelf populations of Calanus speciesas well as create time series of changes in population levelsin specified areas. In addition, various long-term data sets on zooplanktonspecies abundances have been collected by national organisationsin their own territorial waters. Although these may lack the temporalresolution of the CPR data, they have the advantage in most casesof being depth integrated rather than simply sampled from theupper 10m. These data thus represent a powerful complement tothe CPR records, providing an opportunity to 'calibrate' the CPRdata and validate the long term trends. Assimilation, and in somecases archaeology and recovery of these data for the TASC projectis therefore an important activity. Specific data have been identifiedin Iceland (MRII), the Faroe Islands Fisheries Laboratory, andat PINRO in Murmansk, Russia. For example the Icelandic data havebeen collected during May-June each year since 1961. The materialhas recently been analysed with respect to long term trends inbiomass (Astthorsson and Gislason, 1995). However, the seriesalso contains information on zooplankton composition and the stagestructure of C. finmarchicus, but these data have neverbeen analysed. Similarly, the Russian date set contains zooplanktonbiomass observations from May and July each year since 1959.Relativelylittle work has been reported on modelling either the CPR dataseries, or many of the national banked data on zooplankton timeseries. The identification of such models leads to effective summariesof the series in terms of model structure and parameters, andhence facilitates comparisons between species in different locationsand at different times. Methodology: Supply of additional CPR data, beyond those obtainedin respect of ICOS, will be negotiated with the Sir Alister HardyFoundation, UK. Long term data from sampling in Icelandic watersis currently in manuscript form and will be collated and digitisedat MRII. Similarly, access to data for Faroese waters will benegotiated. Comprehensive data on zooplankton in the Barents andNorwegian Seas are known to exist at the PINRO in Murmansk. Thesewill be collated and digitised through collaboration between UITØand local scientists in Russia (Degtereva 1979). The approachto analysing the CPR and other data will have two main thrusts.The first of these is data analytic. This consists of identifyingand developing smoothing and filtering procedures for the estimationof the long term trend and the annual seasonal cycle for eachseries. Considerable care and ingenuity will be required to extractaccurate and reliable estimates because of the frequent sparsityof the individual time series and the fact that the observationsare interrupted by sequences of zeros. In addition, the data aresubject to spatio-temporal variability in sampling intensity,and this should be taken into account in any statistical analysisand modelling. The second effort consists of the constructionand validation of suitable time series models for individual series.The mixed nature of the data, referred to above, necessitatesthe use of non linear time series modelling, a major area of currentresearch interest. SUBTASK 4: Generation patternand switching along the Norwegian midshelf PI: Kurt Tande (ktande@nfh.uit.no) Objective: To describe the across shelf transport of Calanusalong the shelf edge from Møre to Lofoten, and identifythe physical and biological factors responsible for the switchfrom a two generation to an annual generation pattern along theNorwegian midshelf sector. Scientific rationale: In the entire study area C. finmarchicus altersbetween 1-3 generations a year. These patterns are only crudelydefined on a regional basis. The general situation is that thenumber of generations decreases going from low latitudes to higher,and the literature indicate a 2 generation pattern around theBritish Isles, Faroe Island and even up to the Western coast ofNorway (Wiborg 1955). Lofoten, is often referred to as the northerndemarcation line for this two generation cycle (Lie 1965, Tande1991), but substantial gaps in our knowledge of this issue arelacking. Combining the ontogenetic vertical behavior with theprevailing current pattens along the Norwegian shelf might clarifythe condition. Surface currents will tend to bring the reproducingfemales and the recruits northwards, while a progressively deeperposition in the water column will tend to reduce the speed ofthis transport. At some stage in the growth cycle, informationare imposed making CIV and CV capable of deciding on how to proceed:continuing to moulting or descending to diapause. The proportionof CIV and CV recruited from the overwintering generation, leavingfor diapause in May and June will certainly increase with latitudegoing from Møre to Lofoten. Unpublished data on CIV andCV dry weight from the shelf and the shelf break outside Tromsø,do indicate that the copepod body size varies with depth and timeduring the productive season. This region from Møre toLofoten should be revisited several times during the spring andsummer period. Although the physical conditions are well studied,this project will be organised as a multidisiplinary study withstrong basis in physical oceanography and modelling. Methodology: The project will visit the midshelf from Møreto Lofoten during three cruises each of 10 days duration withR.V. "Jan Mayen" in February, April, May and July in1996. On the cruises in 1996, the physical oceanography of thearea will be detailed by CTD (including Flouresence and Lightmeasurements) and the current patterns will be obtained by continousrecords from ADCP. These will provide input data to a well developedphysical model already at hand at SINTEF (Slagstad, 1995). Thevertical and horizontal distribution of life stages will be comparedbetween onshelf and deeper offshelf areas at selected sites fromMøre to Lofoten. Vertical profile sampling will be carriedout by MOCNESS and with the MLA in-situ particle counter (subtask1). During this time period the proportion between CIV/CV fromG1 descending to depths or contining to reproduction will be inferredfrom potential differences in sex-differentiation in CV, sex-ratiosand maturation patterns in adult females, dry weight, prosomelengths and physiological activity. SUBTASK 5: Modelling the cross-shelfdispersal of Calanus PI: Jan O. Backhaus (backhaus@dkrz.d400.de) Objectives: a) To model the finely resolved flow field at theshelf edge in each of the following areas - S Iceland, Faroe,Shetland, W. Norway. b) To explain the observed seasonal evolutionof Calanus distribution and abundance in each of the aboveregions using particle tracking models driven by simulated flowfields. Scientific rationale: The hypothesis behind the task is that the seasonalcolonisation of the shelf seas from the adjacent ocean basin depthsby Calanus depends on an interaction between copepod behaviourand the characteristic flow fields in the surface waters, especiallythe continental slope currents, and the less energetic deep circulationpatterns which form a link between the various shelf regions.Simulation and sensitivity analysis of this phenomenon requiresa combination of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic modelling and lagrangianparticle tracking. Three types of model development are requiredfor the task. The first is the application of a system of 3 nestedhydrodynamic models to previously unmodelled shelf edge regions,to provide high resolution (4km grid spacing, 1hr time resolution)flow field simulations of the continental slope currents. Thesecond is the development of a new model system to simulate thecirculation and overflow of Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW) throughthe Denmark Strait and around and over the Iceland-Scotland Ridge.The third development is the coupling of flow fields generatedby these models to a particle tracking model including the facilityto include biological properties and responses. Methodology: At present, a nested model system exists only forthe northwest Scottish shelf edge (in the NE Atlantic) as a productof the ICOS project (MAS2-CT94-0085). In the proposed task, thesame approach will be applied to model the Faroese, Icelandicand Norwegian shelf edge waters. Similarly, particle trackingschemes to make use of the simulated flow field have been developedduring ICOS and will be applied to the new regions, but will requireto be extended to accommodate application of the proposed developmentof circle-map models of generation cycle characteristics (Subtask14). The modelling of NSDW circulation and overflow will be acompletely new development. The basis for the hydrodynamic modelswill be the HAMSOM (Hamburg Shelf-Ocean Model) finite differencecoding which has evolved from an original model developed by Backhaus(1985). The model systems will be used to carry out a sensitivityanalysis of the scope for variability in climatological forcingat a variety of scales to influence the success of Calanusin colonising the various shelf regions, and in the scopefor correlations in population characteristics between shelf regionsresulting from a teleconnection through the deep water circulation. The modelling work will be shared by three partners.IFM will develop and apply the hydrodynamic models for the regions.SINTEF and MLA have collaborated in developing the particle trackingscheme in IOCS and will continue to do so in TASC. As in ICOS,the Lagrangian simulations will be run separately from the hydrodynamicmodel by transferring the output data from the HAMSOM model toSINTEF and MLA for further applications. TASK 2. LARGE SCALE DISTRIBUTION,LIFE HISTORY AND PREDATION PI: Stein Kaartvedt (steinka@bio.uio.no) Objective: The distribution, abundance and population structureof Calanus are governed by production, predation, advectionand behaviour. Tasks 2 will address these topics on differentspatial and temporal scales. We aim to map large scale and seasonaldistribution patterns and establish the degree of genetic coherenceof Calanus in the northern Seas. Variations in populationstructure and distribution will be studied along latitudinal gradientsto establish how temporal and geographic patterns in physics,primary production and predation pressure influence generationdevelopment, life history and behaviour. SUBTASK 6: Large scale fieldsurvey PI: Bjørnar Ellertsen (bjoernar.ellertsen@imr.no) Objective: Describe the large scale distribution, abundance,and population structure of C. finmarchicus in the NordicSeas for the summer and winter seasons, and assess the geneticcohesiveness of C. finmarchicus Scientific rationale: The population dynamics of C. finmarchicusin the Nordic Seas are influenced both by local environmentalconditions and advection which transports individuals betweendifferent regions. We hypothesise that a core habitat of the speciesis the large scale gyre in the Norwegian Sea, and that its lifecycle has been shaped by adaptation to the specific conditionsof seasonal primary production and predation from migratory (e.g.herring) and non-migratory predators (e.g. mesopelagic fishes,invertebrates). Within its range of distribution, C. finmarchicusencounters a wide range of environmental and biological conditions,e.g. in the seasonal variation in light, primary production, temperatureand predation. This is likely to be reflected in the number ofgenerations produced and in the success of their completion. Although numerous scientific papers have focusedon C. finmarchicus the last 50 years, information has mainlybeen gathered through sampling in limited parts of its distributionalarea. Hence, basic quantitative population dynamics of this speciesare known primarily for certain enclosed fjord areas. Advectionwill influence any time series obtained at a fixed position inthe open ocean. For this reason there is a need to sample a widerarea in order to allow for an estimate of the role of advection.By describing the abundance and population structure in summerwhen the cohorts of developing copepodites are present in theupper layer, one can get information on the timing of the seasonaldevelopment of the new generation and the likely number of generationsin different regions. This will allow identification of areaswhere the second generation is underway, where the first generationhave descended into deeper water, where the first generation showa late development, and areas where situations intermediate betweenthese exist. This large scale pattern of generational developmentcan be related to the strong latitudinal gradient in light, thestrong temperature gradient from East to West, and the advectionby the large scale circulation system of the Nordic Seas. Surveys of the distribution, abundance and populationstructure of the overwintering population of C. finmarchicusin the Nordic Seas will be carried out to identify overwinteringareas which are of importance for the population dynamics andsummer distribution.The northwards flowing Atlantic Current onthe eastern side of the Nordic Seas branches out into the cyclonicgyres of the Norwegian and Greenland Seas. This circulation allowsfor the possibility of "generation stacking", wherethe second generation originating from initial spawning in thesouthern regions descends to overwinter in the same areas wherethe first generation from spawning further north has also descended.The distribution pattern of overwintering C. finmarchicuswill determine the source populations which ascend into the upperocean advective current regime to spawn the following winter. Genetic cohesiveness of a species gene pool is botha determinant and a result of the evolutionary and ecologicalforces acting on that species population. The genetic cohesivenessof a species' population will determine likelihood of raciatonor speciaton events, responses to environmental change, probabilityof extinction, and rates of evolution. Furthermore, a species'genetic cohesiveness across its distributional range may be usedas an indicator of the linkage among ecostystems. If genetic exchangeamong sub-populations of a number of important species at differenttrophic levels is sufficiently small, ecosystems may be said tobe functionally distinct. Conversely, high levels of gene flowsuggest that dynamic processes in the different ecosystems arefunctionally interrelated. Circulation patterns in the NorwegianSea and the adjacent regions may facilitate development of planktonicsubpopulations. Methodology: Summer distributions of C. finmarchicus willbe determined by sampling with MOCNESS, BIONESS or MULTINET multiplesampling systems and WP-2 nets, and by acoustical mapping withshipborne echo sounders (38, 120, 200 kHz). Supporting informationon hydrography (CTD), phytoplankton development (nutrients, chlorophyll,in situ fluoresence), zooplankton size-fractioned biomass, anddistribution and abundance of fish (acoustics, pelagic trawl)will be collected by continuous recording and vertical profiling. This study of genetics will use the frequencies ofdifferent alleles of several genes to describe population structure.Allelic variation of the genes will be determined by variationin the DNA sequence of a portion of each gene for individual copepods.DNA will be extracted from individual copepodes. A region of mitochondrialDNA will be amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology(Innis et al. 1990). Specific techniques are described in Bucklinand Kann (1991) and Stanton et al. (1992). Amplified DNA willbe sequenced, and sequences will be alligned to those of otherindividuals of C. finmarchicus from the Norwegian Sea. The DNAsequencing will be carried out at University of Bergen where wehave access to an Automated DNA Sequencer. The frequency of eachsequence variant in each region will be determined. Standard populationgenetic analyses of population stucture based on allele frequencieswill be done to determine whether the species is significantlystuctured in the Norwegian Sea. SUBTASK 7: Comparative timeseries sampling programme PI: Stein Kaartvedt (steinka@bio.uio.no) PI: Tone Falkenhaug (tonehf@nfh.uit.no) Objective: Describe the annual cycle of vertical distribution,generational development and overwintering of C. finmarchicusat selected locations in the Nordic Seas. Intercompare the regionalpatterns of seasonal migration and generational development andrelate them to seasonal patterns of hydrography and phytoplanktondevelopment. Scientific rationale: There are few time series available which describethe full annual cycle of C. finmarchicus with samplingover an extended part of the water column and temporal resolutionof less then a month. The few available time series are mainlyfrom fjords and coastal waters (Tande 1982, Matthews et al. 1978).An exception is the unique time series obtained by weekly samplingat weathership station "M" in the Norwegian Sea (Østvedt1955). The annual cycle of C. finmarchicus depends on anumber of factors and conditions: stage and state at the beginningof overwintering, temperature and activity during overwintering,maturation and ascent, temperature and feeding conditions forreproduction and cohort development, number of generations, andtiming and duration of overwintering. We will conduct a coordinated and comparative samplingprogramme in order to describe the annual cycle of C. finmarchicusat selected locations in and surounding the Nordic Seas and inwaters south of Iceland. The programme will consist of two components: 1. Frequent sampling (about two weeks interval) atnear-shore locations at the south coast of Iceland, the Faroese,Shetland, and Lofoten in Norway, and at the weathership at station"M" in the eastern Norwegian Sea. 2. Less frequent sampling (2-10 weeks interval dependingon season and practicality) at oceanographic sections across theshelf and out into the deep ocean at the east and northeast coastof Iceland, at the Faroese, and at Møre and Vesterålenin Norway (see map Fig. 1). The main programme will be carried out in 1997 coordinatedwith a similar programme in the northwestern Atlanitc by US GLOBECand possibly Canada. Part of the sampling programme will alsobe carried out in 1996. The results on the population structureand dynamics of C. finmarchicus from the time series samplingprogramme will be interpreted against the background of informationon advection by the large scale circulation system which transportand redistribute the population, and on the distribution of C.finmarchicus revealed by the summer (1996, 1997) and winter(1996/97) large scale surveys. Methodology: The programme will be carried out preferentiallywith depth-stratified sampling by 200 um multiple net samplingsystems (BIONESS, MOCNESS or MULTINET), or with vertical (WP-2)or oblique (Bongo) net hauls where operation of multiple netsare not practically possible. Taxonomic analysis to species andstage, including separation of C. finmarchicus from theclosely related species C. glacialis and C. helgolandicus.Size frequency analysis will be performed on subsets of data.Standard protocols of sampling and taxonomic analysis will beestablished, and intercalibration will be carried out as partof QA. Supporting information on hydrography (CTD) and phytoplanktondevelopment (nutrients, chlorophyll, in situ fluorescence) willbe collected. SUBTASK 8: Calanusin different light and predatory regimes PI: Stein Kaartvedt (steinka@bio.uio.no) Objectives: Assess mortality risk of Calanus with respectto visual predators (fish) along a latitudinal gradient in theNorwegian Sea and how this impacts plankton vertical distributionand life history traits. Scientific rationale: Latitudinal and seasonal gradients in light conditionsare fundamental elements of the Norwegian sea ecosystem, probablywith profound impact on predator-prey relationships between visualpredators and Calanus. We will address the following hypotheses: 1. Northern stocks of Calanus to a large extentleave upper layers for overwintering in early summer (Østvedt1955). We hypothesize that the early descent is due to an unprofitabletradeoff between food intake and danger of predation inregions/seasons with midnight sun or very short dark periods. 2. Horizontally migrating fish (e.g. herring andmackerel) are major visual predators on Calanus duringsummer (Melle et al. 1994). By relying on their schooling behaviourand rapid swimming in predator avoidance, they may forage in upperlayers by day. 3. Resident, mesopelagic fish performing diel verticalmigrations (Benthosema glaciale, Maurolicus muelleri) aremajor predators on Calanus in periods/regions with day/nightcycles, but not in periods/regions with mid-night sun. They feedactively on near surface copepod assemblages during short "antipredatorywindows" near sunset and sunrise, and their large eyes possiblyalso facilitates fairly efficient feeding during night (Giskeet al. 1990, Aksnes & Giske 1993). They do not prey on Calanusduring day in seasons when the copepods inhabit upper layers.An unprofitable light climate for feeding conditions may reducethe success of mesopelagic fish at high latitudes. 4. Calanus overwintering depth in the Norwegiansea is related to the prevailing predatory field with mesopelagicfish playing a key role. In the presence of mesopelagic fish,oceanic stocks of Calanus descend to great depths duringwinter since these fishes are foraging efficiently at low lightintensities. In waters devoid of mesopelagic fish, however, Calanusmay select an overwintering depth without being constrained byvisual predators. If mesopelagic fish are excluded (or stronglyreduced in numbers) at high latitudes, this may impact habitatchoice of Calanus during winter. 5. Calanus exhibits flexibility in selectionof overwintering depth with respect to presence of prevailingpredators Methodology: Studies on zooplankton vertical distribution willbe done by MOCNESS, Multinet, WP2 net, Juday net or by pump. Fishwill be assessed acoustically (SIMRAD EK 500, 38 Khz), and byHarstad trawl. Studies on the impact of midnight sun willbe performed on cruises with "Jan Mayen" in May andJuly 1996, and on a cruise with "Haakon "Mosby"from waters off Bergen to north of the polar circle the summerof 1997. Studies on migration and feeding by mesopelagic fishwill be carried out along the same transects. Egg production measurements(by incubation) will be done along the same transect. Animalsfor gut fluorescence measurements will be sampled day and night.Size fractionated chlorophyll measurements will be performed toassess field feeding conditons. Studies on the vertical distributionof Calanus along a latitudinal gradient during winter willbe done in cooperation with the Institute of Marine Research,Bergen, using their research vessels. The flexibility in selectionof overwintering habitat will also be addressed by comparativestudies the vertical distribution of Calanus in fjordswith, and without mesopelagic fish. Two-day cruises with the researchvessel "Hans Brattstroem" will be carried out each month(budget permitting) from the summer 1996 to spring 1997, complementedby cruises with RV "Haakon Mosby" spanning several days.We will synthesize data on herring and mackerel abundance, distributionand feeding to get a rough estimate on their potential pedationimpact on Calanus. SUBTASK 9: Data management(database) PI: Bjørnar Ellertsen (bjoernar.ellertsen@imr.no) Objectives: Develop and maintain a data management policy (re.reporting, handling and property) covering all the subtasks inTASC along those lines developed in the Code of Data Managementin MAST-III Projects. Scientific rationale and methodology: Some of the data management needs in TASC are fairlyconventional in character for the CTD data type. Small data setsof currents measurements from shipborn ADCP, will be aquired duringthe project, but plans have to be developed in the project inorder to handle these data as they are considered important forthe validation of large and nested hydrodynamic models in someof the subtasks. Here TASC will build on experience attained inOMEX and other projects which have been frequently using ADCPfor current measurements. Other, small data sets from laboratoryand mesocosms experiments, will be aquired during the project,but no plans have been made to handle these data as they are requiredby individual researchers, and are considered to be of minor valueto the overall TASC database. On the other hand, the data bankfor the zooplankton, providing information on biomass and demographyin the TASC study area will be established. This is considereda major challenge in this subtask. Since ICES will be doing theplankton management, for the Arctic Ocean Grand Challenge, ifapproved, ICES and IMR will work closely to ensure compatibleas possible procedures for managing zooplankton data in variousproposed EU projects in this area. The Institute of Marine Research has designed anIngres relation database that include all type of marine data.The database is designed as a generic structure in order to allowfor the integration of data. This implies that new types of datacan be modelled to fit into the database. For the present datafrom CTD, nutrients, plankton, fish egg and larvae and fish ismodelled for the database. IMR have worked out routine for qualitycontrol of CTD data, and is working on quality procedures fornutrients and plankton. The database was set into production fromJanuary 1995 The responsibiliy of ICES in this Data Managementsubtask will be to oversee and analyse the results of any insitu and instrument intercalibration exercises, ensuring thatdocumentation accompanying the data is complete and accurate,all CTD data to be pre-processed and calibrated in accordancewith the guidelines set by SCOR WG 51 and the JPOTS OceanographicManual, with the independent variable being expressed in decibars(pressure). Furthermore, the CTDs must be calibrated on each andevery deployment, data to be supplied in formats and media tobe mutually agreed, data will be quality assessed in accordancewith standard ICES procedures. This will include comparisons withclimatology. The responsible scientists must respond immediatelyon any matters related to measurement quality. ICES will not setflags for doubtful quality, but all such cases will be documented,and resolved via a discussion between ICES and the responsiblescientist, and if necessary, the project coordinator. compatiblewith the institutes software resources. On the application side,efforts will be put into building general easy-to use data selections.An agreed system of encryption will be used to prevent unauthorisedaccess. SUBTASK 10 Modelling the effectof large scale advection and life cycle strategies PI: Bjørnar Ellertsen (bjoernar.ellertsen@imr.no) Objectives: Quantify how advection within the Norwegian Sea andlife cycle strategies (number of generations per year, developmentalrate and vertical migration behaviour) interact to produce thedistribution pattern and high production rate of this speciesthat is observed. Scientific rationale: The eastern part of the Norwegian Sea receives warmAtlantic water mainly through the Faroe -Shetland channel. Thiswater flows northward along the eastern continental slope. Sincethe temperature is higher here than elsewhere, the growth rateand the number of generations per year is higher than in otherparts of the Norwegian Sea. New generations of C. finmarchicusare usually developing in the upper 300 m where the northwardtransport is fast. A female that ascends from its overwinteringdepth North of Shetland may produce offsprings that, after twoor three generations descend to deep water outside Northern Norwayin late summer. How can the southern population maintain itselfwhen the advection losses apparently should dilute the stock rapidly?Is the productivity of the Northern stock (Lofoten Basin) in thelong run dependent on supply from the Norwegian Basin stock? Southwardtransport may take place as a counter flow below the slope currentor in the basin wide gyres. It may take years to complete thiscycle. Methodology: The answers to the questions addressed here can onlybe acheived through a combined, basin wide hydrodynamical modelcoupled to a life cycle model of C. finmarchicus. Typicallymodel simulations periods will be a year or more. Since thereare many uncertainties both in the biology of Calanus andthe current field when such long term simulations are performed,model investigation will concentrate on scenarios and sensitivitytests. Three climatic cases will be simulated: Climatic averagewith monthly mean flow field and temperatures, and two cases withhigh and low inflow of Atlantic water, respectively, using dailyaverage flow. These simulations will be performed by the ECOM-3Dwhich is already established for the area by HI. Climatologicalmean flow is already available (Engedahl et al. 1995). Modellingdeep circulation depends to a large degree on a correct densityfield. Improvement of the existing field by available observationswill be performed before the last two scenarios are produced.The elements that comprise a life cycle model (generation time,developmental rate and vertical migration behaviour, survivalprobability), are investigated in other subtasks. The life cyclemodel will be of a Lagrangian type where particles having attachedstate variables. Each particle is allowed to develop (change state),die and reproduce by spawning of new particles having state variablestypical for off-springs. Several scenarios will be performed wereparameters (and assumptions) in the life cycle model are perturbedfor each of climatic cases. TASK 3: PHYSIOLOGY, GROWTH ANDREPRODUCTION PI: Roger Harris (rph@wpo.nerc.ac.uk) Objectives: TASC experimental studies will combine laboratory,mesocosm, and shipboard experimentation with modelling to advancequantitative knowledge of the feeding biology, reproductive biology,and key life-cycle phenomena of Calanus finmarchicus overthe trans latitudinal range. This component of TASC will interactstrongly with the proposed field programme, both by providingkey analytical and shipboard experimental input to TASC cruises,and also by testing, under defined laboratory conditions, criticalhypotheses generated by the field programme. SUBTASK 11: Regional and seasonalvariability of feeding and reproduction. PI: Hans-Jürgen Hirche (hhirche@awi-bremerhaven.de) Objectives: Develop and standardize methods to assess egg productionfrom live and preserved specimens. Establish the annual life andreproductive cycle in different water masses in relation to phytoplanktondevelopment and abiotic conditions. Determine the influence ofenvironmental variables on feeding and reproduction. Scientific rationale: The only data on the complete seasonal reproductivecycle of C. finmarchicus are from 2 fjords (Diel and Tande1992, Plourde and Runge 1993). From more sporadic measurementsa strong regional variability of the beginning of the spawningseason, usually associated with the spring bloom, has been observed,although microzooplankton was shown to be an adequate substitutefor phytoplankton as a food source. It has been known for a longtime that C. finmarchicus can breed through up to threegenerations per year, but the regional variability of the numberof generations is not at all understood. The time series workat weathership "M" and selected stations on cruiseswill be used for this work. In order to cover a wide geographicrange including the open ocean, we will employ a combination ofstandardized measurements of egg production from live specimensand from preserved samples. To achieve this, an existing method(Runge 1987) will be improved by including histological preparationsof the female gonad. A strong discrepancy has been observed between life-timefecundity of females fed in the laboratory (Hirche 1991) and afjord population (Diel and Tande 1992), which laid only 20 % ofthe eggs spawned by laboratory females. We will tackle this problemby studying the effect of female condition, food quantity andquality on egg production. The role of senescence of females willalso be investigated. Methodology: Grazing, female condition (CN and lipid composition,gonad maturity) egg production (on shipboard and preserved samples),hatching viability, and nauplii survival will be determined. SUBTASK 12: Culture experimentson nutrition, growth and reproduction PI: Roger Harris (rhp@wpo.nerc.ac.uk) Objective: To define the biochemical components of the dietneeded for Calanus growth and reproduction and to determine,using laboratory cultures, how growth, egg production, and eggviability vary with the diversity of diet. Scientific rationale: This subtask will establish cultures of C. finmarchicus,using material collected in the field programme, and will buildon experience with C. helgolandicus, cultures of whichare currently maintained over multiple generations at PML. Thisapproach will provide relevant information for understanding lifecycle phenomena and contribute to the calibration and validationof the population dynamics model (subtask 14). The culture facilitywill provide a central resource for TASC, both for studying behaviouralmechanisms determining life history strategy, and enable new biochemicaland molecular techniques to be evaluated under controlled conditions,before deployment in the field programme. In addition the laboratoryculture experiments will address aspects of overwintering physiologybased on suggestions from the field programme. The effect of environmentalvariables will be considered and the aim will be to mimic multi-generationCalanus population dynamics in the laboratory. It is anultimate goal to have both sibling species in simultaneous culture,enabling critical comparative physiological studies to be madeunder defined conditions. An increased effort in nutritional biochemistry,particularly lipid biochemistry, exploring the dietary links betweenCalanus and its food environment will significantly advanceunderstanding of the relationships between diet and production.Dietary diversity is expected to enhance production. Recognisingthe importance of omnivory (Kleppel, 1993), new approaches areneeded to establish relations between food quantity and quality,and development rate and egg production. It is well established that lipids play a vital rolein the life history strategies of polar organisms (Sargent etal., 1993). However, it is poorly understood: a) how environmentalvariables determine the production of lipids in the marine environmentand hence the availability to C. finmarchicus, b) the rateat which dietary lipid is ingested/assimilated by C. finmarchicusand/or biosynthesised in the field, c) if, in some circumstances,the availability of essential dietary lipids in the marine environmentaffects the growth and reproduction of Calanus. Optimalgrowth and egg production by Calanus requires an adequatefood composition; some essential fatty acids, for example, cannotbe synthesised by copepods. It is not clear whether the naturalfood environment is generally adequate in dietary terms, or whetherCalanus spp. are sometimes limited by food compositionin nature as opposed to food concentration. This needs to be determined;it is important to establish whether fecundity is driven by foodcharacteristics, and to incorporate this critical linkage in models.This component of TASC will interact strongly with the proposedfield programme, by providing key analytical and shipboard (weathership"M") experimental input to TASC cruises, and also bytesting, under defined laboratory conditions, critical hypothesesgenerated by the field programme. Methodology: Controlled culture experiments under defined regimeswill be combined with detailed lipid and molecular analysis, andpopulation dynamics and modelling. SUBTASK 13: Latitudinal differencesin population dynamics: Mesocosm studies PI: Benni Hansen (bhansen@virgil.ruc.dk) Objective: Identify the environmental cues governing the lifecycle pattern along a latitudinal gradient from 60oto 70o N along the Norwegiancoast. Scientific rationale. A two year cultivation study of C. finmarchicusfrom eggs to adults will be conducted. We will compare and contrastresponses in growth pattern, developmental and mortality schedulesto variations in physical settings among cohorts from two geographicallydistinct populations. These populations should potentially havedifferent history and physiological adaptations. Eggs from a northern(Grøtsund, 70 oN)and from a southern population (Trondheimsfjorden, 63 oN)will be obtained at the two sites, and brought to one mesocosmsite. We will perform two such experiments - one in 1996 and onein 1997. The hatched nauplii, from the two sites, will be raisedin triplicates, in parallel mesocosm in the northern site duringthe first year, and in the southern site during the next year.The mesocosms will be run for the period from March to June/July.The Ho hypothesis willthus be that there is no differences in growth pattern, developmentaland mortality schedules among the two geographical distinct populationsof C. finmarchicus. Methodology: Cylindric mesocosms (50 m3)arranged around a platform nearby Kårvika Research Stationin Tromsø, will be filled with FSW, and stocked with Calanuseggs, and a composite natural phytoplankton community, generatedfrom spores in sediment samples form the area. After Day 30 additionalstocks of flagellates will be added in order ensure a high qualitydiet for the intensive growth period during the copepodite stages(see Berggreen et al. 1988; Hansen et al. 1994). Light conditionsin the mesocosms will be set equal to 10 m of depth by maintaininga light filtering net on to of each mesocosm. The food conditions,temperature and salinity will be monitored daily. Parameters liketemperature, chlorophyll, particulare organic carbon (Infra RedGas Analyser), C/N, species composition of phytoplankton and microzooplanktonwill be monitored weekly. Copepod samples will be obtained weeklyby a plankton net (100 and 180 mmmesh), staged, weighed and stored for later lipid analysis. Sexdifferentiation, signs of diapause entry and the degree of moultingsuccess to a second generation will be studied by gonad examinationof the cohorts under study. SUBTASK 14: Modelling growth,reproduction and life cycle PI: Francois Carlotti (carlotti@ccrv.obs-vlfr.fr) Objectives: Based on the laboratory, mesocosm and field results,to model region specific growth and egg production patterns andlife cycles, and investigate population synchrony with circle-mapmodelling. Scientific rationale:To understand life cycle strategy and estimate production of copepods,we must know the common characteristics of growth and developmentfor the individuals of the same population and the sources oftheir variability. Models coupling the physiological approachwith stage structure and mortality as developed by Carlotti &Sciandra (1989) enable the dynamics of all the developmental stages,in variable conditions of food and temperature, to be simulated.Despite numerous experiments on the physiological processes ofcopepods (ingestion, metabolism, growth) and on cohort development,the links between growth (biomass increase) and development (stageprogression) are not fully understood (TASC Report). The experimentalwork proposed in the previous two subtasks will provide an opportunity,using the data generated, to address the outstanding questionof model calibration. Modelling will also be a synthetic tooltesting hypotheses on Calanus population dynamics resultingfrom the laboratory, mesocosm and field studies. To develop a life cycle model compatible with thecomputational demands of operation in tandem with a particle trackingdispersal model, an alternative approach is also necessary. Deterministicand stochastic models to predict the optimal seasonal time forentry and exit of diapause in species which can only overwinterin diapause have been available for some time. These tend to beparameter rich. Gurney et al. (1992) explored the use of circle-mapmodels, a method used in mechanics modelling, to investigate populationsynchrony for species with seasonal diapause. The models are parametersparse, and function by tracking generation lines, predictingsuccessive spawning times in relation to the periodicity of theforcing environmental signal - precisely the approach requiredto simulate reproduction in a particle tracking system. This methodhas shown that for insect taxa the size and timing of entry todiapause is critical for population persistence under seasonallyadverse conditions, whilst wide flexibility in the size and timeof diapause entry and exit is a feature allowing colonisationof a wide latitudinal range. For example, tropical insect specieswhich succeed in colonising temperate environments. In C. finmarchicusthe diapause stage is relatively extended in the open ocean (3-5months). In insects this commonly results in high degree of populationsynchrony. The use of circle-map models seems appropriate forinvestigate this life-cycle aspect. Methodology: Existing models will be further developed, and appliedto the life history strategy of C.finmarchicus.

The taxonomic analysis of Calanus. Initially gelatinous zooplankton are removed from the samplesand their displacement volume measured. The larger animals (euphausiids,amphipods, caridea and fish larvae) are then removed and countedfrom whole samples. Calanus should be the target species.However, in certain areas there is a mixture of two Calanusspecies which may be difficult to discriminate (C. finmarchicus/C.helgolandicus or C. finmarchicus/C. glacialis). Beforestarting the stageing, the following check should be done: 1) In areas where it is likely that there is a mixture of C.finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus: Before startingthe sub-sampling and stageing, 20 adult females and 20 C5 Calanusshould be identified to species level, or all of either stagepresent in the sample if <20 are available. If the 40 specimens are either all C. finmarchicus or allC. helgolandicus, the 40 identified specimens are thenreplaced in the sample before sub-sampling. However, if the speciesdetermination of the 40 specimens show more than one Calanusspecies to be present in the sample, then 20 male Calanusshould also be identified to species level Then after replacing the specimens in the sample, sub-sampling,counts and stage identification should be made. If there are <2-300Calanus in a sample then all specimens should be examined.If there are >2-300 Calanus then a sub-sample containingat least 100 Calanus should be examined. Counts shouldbe made for each of adult females, males and copepodite stagesC1, C2, C3, C4 and C5. 2) In areas where it is likely that there is an admixture of C.finmarchicus, C. glacialis and/or C. hyperboreus: Beforestarting the sub-sampling and stageing, 100 individuals shouldbe identified to stage and measured for cephalothorax lengths.Species identification is made according to length criteria (seeHirche et al. 1994, Unstad & Tande 1991).The 100 specimensare replaced in the sample, and subsampling and counts shouldbe made exactly as above. If C. glacialis or C. hyperboreusare found in the samples, the first three stages should be recordedas belonging to Calanus spp. (i.e. Calanus spp.CI, Calanus spp. CII, Calanus spp. CIII), whilethe remaining instars should be assigned to species. 3) True C. finmarchicus samples should be separately flaggedin the archive lists. Analysis results for archiving should show for each sample: 1. Sample Identifier (to relate to a separate record of sampling),calculated Volume of sea sampled (m3) and Analyst Name. 2. Species Separation data by stage and species as counts totalling20 each for females, C5 and males where more than a single speciesis found, or actual numbers where <20 specimens are available. 3. Volumes proportions of Sub-sample and Sample (eg. 10/250 mlor 1 if total sample). 4. The species and stages and associated counts, calculated tonumbers per sample 5. Number measured, followed by Lengths and Stage data. 2. CTD Data on temperature and salinity from CTD should be calibratedregularly with water sampling bottles. The salinity should beanalysed according to ICES standards. For those who currentlydo not meet the ICES standards, please consult "Processingof oceanographic station data, Unesco, 1991", or contactDr. Garry Hopwood, ICES (garry@server.ices.dk). 3. Measurements of egg production. Where possible, live tows should be slow vertical tows from astandard depth (ca. 60 m) not taking more than 15 minutes. Longertows result in more dead animals. The catch is gently dilutedand transferred into c. 10-20 l plastic bucket. This water mustbe in situ surface water, at least at ambient temperature andpreferably slightly chilled. Any warming of copepods results inpremature release of eggs per females. We recommend "Cool-packs"easily available plastic ice blocks which can be used to chillthe water and keep it cool. Seawater frozen in strong polythenebags also works. Plastic materials such as Cool-packs and anynew plastic bucket etc., should be soaked in seawater for 24 hoursprior to use to leach out any chemicals. Samples are immediately taken from the plastic bucket and transferredto Petri dishes. Females in good condition are sorted out usinga stereomicroscope with cold stage and a pipette. The femalesare then placed into egg production chambers pre-filled with sieved(90 mm) surface water. One female isadded to each chamber and if possible 30 replicates should bedone per station. The egg production chambers should be equippedwith mesh (300-500 mm) false bottomsto separate eggs from females. Containers are then suspended inat least 250 ml beakers or other containers with a closed topfor running water incubation. The chambers are incubated a) on deck in water bath with flowingsurface water or b) in a constant temperature room at the ambientsurface water temperature. The light should be dim, not exceedingthe ambient illumination at 5 m depth at the sampling station. The incubation time should be 24 hours, or up to 48 h at low temperatures(<5o C). Incubations are terminated by filteringonto a 20 mm screen, which is immediatelypreserved in 4% formaline. The number of eggs on the screen maybe counted immediately or later on land, under a stereomicroscope.The incubated female is measured (cephalothorax length) and preservedin 4% formaldehyde. Fecundity is expressed as the number of eggsproduced per day. 4. Measurements of gut fluorescence Gut content: The cod-end content from a live tow is dilutedand gently rinsed onto 200 um sieve with chilled and fine-filtered(<1 mm) seawater to remove debrisand any cells that may adhere to the animals. The sieve is keptsubmerged at all times. A portion of the sample is placed in acryotube, wrapped in aluminium foil, and frozen immediately (-20oC or lower), preferably in liquid nitrogen. Further analysis is made in the laboratory within one month aftercollection: A portion of the contents of the Petri dish is allowedto thaw for 5-10 minutes in the dark. 10 individuals of Calanusfinmarchicus are picked out under dim light and placed insmall tubes with 5 ml of 90% acetone (at least 5 replicates).The tubes are capped and kept chilled in the dark for at least1.5 hours for extraction (Huntley et al. 1987). Homogenizationor crushing of the sample is not necessary according to Simradet al (1985), Kleppel et al. (1988) and Morales et al (1990). The fluorescence of the extract is measured before and after acidificationwith 10% HCl in a Turner Designs Model 10 Fluorometer (calibratedwith pure chlorophyll a). Gut pigment content is calculated usingthe modified formulas of Strickland & Parsons (1968). Theresults are expressed as total gut pigment content (chlorophylla equivalent). Ingestion rates are calculated according to theformula I = S * R, where S is the mean gut pigment (ng chlorophylla equivalents ind-1) and R is the gut evacuation rateconstant (time-1) as estimated from the gut evacuationexperiments. Gut evacuation experiment: The cod-end content from a livetow is diluted and gently rinsed onto 200 mmsieve with chilled and fine-filtered (<1 mm)seawater. The sample is transferred to a 50 l container filledwith filtered seawater. The container is placed in the dark ina water bath with ambient temperature from which the animals werecollected. Where many animals are present some gentle aerationor mixing may be reqired. Dead and decaying animals are excludedby careful siphoning. Subsequent subsampling from the containertakes place at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 240 minutesafter collection, and frozen immediately as described above. Afinal sample is taken after 24 hours as a value on backgroundfluorescence. Further analysis is made in the laboratory as describedabove, within one month after collection. 5. Egg hatching success In connection with the egg production measurements, an additional5-10 females are incubated solely for viability experiments. Incubationsare carried out at ambient temperature in standard 6 well (15ml) tissue culture plates. Females are individually incubatedin the wells for 24 hours. Then females are removed. Eggs arecounted and kept in the chambers for further incubation. The incubatedfemale is measured (cephalothorax length) and preserved in 4%formaldehyde. Incubation of eggs is terminated after 72 hoursby pipetting the eggs onto a 20 mmscreen which is immediately preserved in 4% formaline. The numberof unhatched eggs and hatched nauplii on the screen may be countedimmediately or later on land, under a stereomicroscope. Alternatively,the use of neutral red as a vital stain, will stain live and deadeggs differently, and allows the normally transparent eggs andnauplii to be counted more easily. Use of video or silhouettephotgraphy may allow recording for later analysis of such experiments. 6. Mesh size in nets for quantitative sampling The specific mesh size used by different partners, depends onthe equipment available at the different institutions. However,standard mesh size for quantitative sampling should be in therange of 180 - 200 mm. References Hirche et al 1994 Huntley, M., Tande, K, Eilertsen H Chr. 1987.

MEETING REPORT Participants: UIT�: K. Tande UiB: D. Aksnes IMR: B. Ellertsen, F. Rey, H. Sagen, H.R. Skjoldal, S. Sundby, R. Sundt, B. �dlandsvik 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION K.Tande gave an overview of the strategic plan for 1996, as it appears in the "Technical Annex". A short overview of the achievements obtained in ICOS was given. Thereafter he presented the main conclusions from Task 1 meeting in Trondheim 13-14 April. Historical data series (subtask 1.3): Large amounts of data are held in Murmansk (PINRO), partly published by Degtereva (1979). Access to Russian data is important. F�roese data series exist from 1989, and Islandic data from 1961. CPR data on C. finmarchicus exists from the last 40 years, access to the data depends on funding. Cross shelf dispersal (subtask 1.5): There is a need to connect the IMR subtask 2.5 with subtask 1.5 of IfM especially with regard to area to be investigated. Field activities: TASK 1 and 2 must be integrated with respect to field activities. Protocols for standardization of methods must be produced. It was noted that the Norwegian research community is lacking appropriate equipement in order to study mesoscale phenomena pertinent to Calanus. A plan for important activities in 1996 was presented: 1) A modelling WS was suggested in Strathclyde 19-22 Aug., with participation strong participation from modellers throughout the TASC community. 2) First annual meeting for TASC was scheduled to January 1997, with C. Miller and R. Harris as co-conveners. 2. LARGE SCALE FIELD SURVEY (Subtask 2.1) IMR aim at a large field survey in the Norwegian Sea in June 1997. Since the Institute's cruise plans for 1997 are not ready pr. date, the exact area and time can not be established. However, the aim is to cover the entire Norwegian Sea (except the southernmost area), parts of the Icelandic Ocean and hopefully parts of the Greenland Sea. In the southwestern part of the area covered with IMR vessles the survey must be coordinated with the Icelandic investigations. B. Ellertsen and S. Kaartvedt will make a detailed plan for the large scale field investigation 1997. The investigation on Calanus genetics was discussed. DANA has samples from the North Sea area, these could be made available to the IMR scientists. H.R.Skjoldal and R.Sundt gave an overview over the present status with regard to IMR's investigations: Our deliverables will partly be based upon material sampled in 1994, from where we have Calanus material from most of the Norwegian Sea, parts of the Icelandic Sea and Greenland Sea. Since we until now lack material from the southernmost areas, we have not been able to go deeply into the question of north-south differences in Calanus genetics. The DANA material, or material from the Faeroese area in spring, may solve this problem. R. Sundt will contact M. Heath.Since the IMR studies on Calanus genetics are coordinated with Ann Bucklin's investigations, there is already a link between EU TASC and US in this matter. There is a need to distribute descriptions of methods and techniques used by the various institutes, that includes sampling, calibration, sample treatment etc., at all levels from temperature, salinity, chl.phyll, zooplankton subsampling etc. Such descriptions are not needed only for the large field investigations, but also with respect to the time series programme. We should aim at some kind of standardization, though not too detailed. Since the various institutes partly use different kinds of equipment, the standardization can not be too rigorous. What we should aim at is depth stratified sampling. (The ICES Zooplankton WG met in Bergen two weeks prior to the TASC meeting, they conclude that standardization at sampling level should be deemphasized, however, they suggest a standard mesh size of 200 um for mesozooplankton sampling). IMR usually uses 180 um nets, US GLOBEC 150 um. 3. CALANUS IN DIFFERENT LIGHT AND PREDATORY REGIMES (SUBTASK 2.3) D.Aksnes (UIB) gave an outline of the activity so far. Some cruises have already been carried out (since Nov 1995) in various Norwegian fjords showing different predator status. The status of predators and optical characteristiscs in these fjords have been mapped. Sampling of Calanus has been performed with a Multinet, their nauplii with a plankton pump, and their aim has been to investigate winter mortality in relation to Calanus behaviour and presence of predators. These investigations will continue in two of the fjords (Lurefjorden and S�rfjorden) until autumn, minimum once a month. The predator status is quite opposite in these two sites. There is also a pronounced difference in size and behaviour of the Calanus in these fjords. Calanus in different light regimes will be investigated at two transects in the Norwegian Sea, one transects in the northern part, one in southern part in the summer period. Skjoldal suggested that these investigations partly could be combined with IMR's fishery investigations, by a combined survey with UIB's reseach vessel �H�kon Mosby� and the IMR vessels. In that case Kaartvedt must communicate their plans within May to B.Ellertsen who will try toincorporate these in the IMR cruise schedule 1997. The final plans for the IMR fishery surveys 1997 are not yet ready, the sampling within subtask 2.1 should probably take place during these surveys. Since TASC is closely connected to other IMR zooplankton investigations (theprogramme �Mare Cognitum�) synergy will hopefully be gained with respect to the laboratory treatment of samples. Working zooplankton samples in the laboratory is a crucial bottleneck, K.Tande gave an overview of his cooperation with Russian scientists in this matter. Four scientists in Moscow are engaged in working zooplankton samples. The quality of their work is good, and K.Tande suggested that we extend this arrangement. 4. COMPARATIVE TIME SERIES PROGRAMME IN 1997 (SUBTASK 2.2) Weather ship M(ike) will be operating in the Norwegian Sea at least ultimo 1999. The owner has been informed that IMR and TASC might be interested in expanding the present cooperation. F. Rey informed about the ship; there is a series of cabins for accomodation, however, no laboratory. F. Rey has used the ship for several years, and in the period April-June 1991 zooplankton samples were taken daily. Samples from every 4th day have been looked into (samples and data are available for those interested). F. Rey is currently running a phytoplankton project, in cooperation with Prof. M. Mork, UIB, at station �M�. B.Ellertsen, F.Rey and M. Johannessen (IMR) will look into the logistics; equipment, accomodation, lab.containers, cooling facilities etc., in early May, and provide information to S. Kaartvedt for further distribution. According to S. Kaartvedt, H.-J.Hirche and his group is interested in taking part in the sampling at station �M� in 1997. Lofoten S.Skreslet (NOC) will be responsible for a frequent sampling in the Lofoten. According to K.Tande the plans for this sampling are already settled, and will be made available to S. Kaartvedt. Drilling platforms at M�re-Helgeland K Tande informed that M.Heath plans sampling from oil rigs in the North Sea, using a modified WP-2 net. According to H.R.Skjoldal IMR earlier has used platform supply ships for weekly sampling. No descicions were made with regard to expanding the existing sampling programme to oil platforms, fixed oceanographic stations along the Norwegian coast etc., and the conclusion was that new ideas with regard to sampling within the �time series programme� should be communicated to B. Ellertsen and S. Kaartvedt for further evaluation. Less frequent sampling (2-10 weeks interval): Svin�y- and Gims�y transects.(Note that in �Technical annex� there is a printing error; �Fulg�ysnittet� instead of �Gims�ysnittet�). B.Ellertsen informed about the present sampling programme at these transects. Samples (up to about 20 stations per transect) are taken with varying time intervals, 0.5-2 times a month. The aim has been to cover at least the Svin�y transect twice a month, however, due to lack of ship time sampling has not been as regularly as planned. For the year 1997 the sampling plan for these sections must be fixed already in early autumn 1996. At present sampling takes place using a WP-2 net at all stations, additionally MOCNESS-trawl at 3-5 stations per transect. Increasing the number of MOCNESS stations brings about capacity problems with regard to further handling of samples. Within the �time series programme� there is a need for a detailed discussion with regard to cooperation, methods, etc., there is also a need to coordinate the investigations with US. Globec. S. Kaartvedt has been asked to be responsible for coordinating this part of the EU TASC and US Globec. 5. LARGE SCALE MODELLING (SUBTASK 2.5) B. �dlandsvik gave an overview of the present status with regard to modelling. G. Eriksrud will work together with B. �dlandsvik, they cooperate with D.Slagstad (SINTEF). At present they have a modell based upon two scenarios, one year with low, the other year with high inflow into the Norwegian Sea. Slagstad will use these models as a basis for his plankton drift model. �dlandsvik plans to extent this two years into 5-6 yars, also including a cold and a warm years. The model includes the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea, using a climatology produced in cooperation with DNMI (Norwegian Meteorological Institute). The grid is 20 km.Slagstad's model for the shelf area has a finer grid, 4 km. Combining the IMR and SINTEF models should be an easy task. Combining the IfM model is a challenge, since this model has some problems in the border area towards Iceland, they will also loose parts of the North Sea if they want to include the Lofotens in their 14-grid model. K.Tande underlined that there is a great need to exchange information and enhance cooperation between IMR, SINTEF and IfM on this issue. The conclusion from the model discussion is that B.�dlandsvik will participate in the modelling WS, in advance he will communicate with Dagmar Heinbucker. K.Tande will ensure that this will be an item for discussion at the workshop. As �dlandsvik planned to extend their model to include several years, B. Ellertsen informed about an interesting data set that is available from Lofoten 1987. This year several transects (8-10) across the Vestfjord was visited frequently in the period February-end April. Sampling for copepod naupli and copepods was performed with nets, data are available on numbers of Calanus, stages, lengths, etc., environmental data as salinity, temperature, nutrients etc. also exist.The preliminary investigation of the data shows an inflow of Calanus into the Vestfjord. This data set could be made available for modelling, especially by Slagstad. 6. DATA MANAGEMENT (SUBTASK 2.4) Data management is a very important part of the IMR TASC, and K.Tande wanted a thorough discussion on this subject. �Review of the objectives and the methodology used as specifiec in the Code of Data Management in the Mast-III Projects�, as given in the agenda, was notdiscussed, since H. Loeng was not present at the meeting. It is assumed that this matter is taken care of, in the very near future, and Harald Loeng will be in charge for this subtask. Environmental data/zooplankton Both with regard to environmental data and zooplankton data there is a need to establish commom standards. Environmental data includes salinity, ADCP, temperature, fluorescence, chl.ph.-a,, and the standardization must include calibration and data management. With regard to Calanus we must agree on how to present data, f.i. numbers per m3 per stage etc. IMR will, iun the very near future, distribute a protocole presenting the IMR quality control routines. Databank for zooplankton data H. Sagen informed about the existing databases at IMR. There is a HELIX database for zooplankton only, and an INGRESS research database, which will include alle data, both environment, plankton and fish. According to Sagen establishing another TASC database will be an easy task, based upon what we already have at IMR. There is of course a challenge to make this operative for all partners while the TASC project is in progress. It should be possible to use the same software as used by JGOFS/US GLOBEC to distribute data on Internet, if we choose such a solution. For safety reasons the IMR database at present is located inside a �fire wall� and thereby unaccessible without a special safety data access card. We discussed the location of a TASC database, and found that locating this outside this �fire wall� might be the best solution. The data within the US GLOBEC are quite open to everbody, within EU projectsthere is also general lines as to the accessibility of data. K.Tande felt that in EU-TASC the accessibility of data should follow the directions used within US GLOBEC. ICES probably want the data to be stored on a format that is convenient for the ICES community. H. Loeng will act as the IMR coordinator towards ICES. A brief version in English of the IMR data base description is planned within May 15. This document have been compiled by Bjornar Ellertsen, and prepared for the webside by K.Tande.

He identified the modelling aspects of the project as being a focus for coordination in the first year since a) experience from other projects indicates that this is an area which must be carefully organised early in the project, and b) it was the least well specified part of the project in the technical annex. A general project meeting is planned for the end of 1996. The time series sampling programme in Task 2 is also not yet very well defined. S.Kaartvet (Oslo) will coordinate the development of this programme. A meeting would be held in Bergen during 15-17 April to discuss the programmes in Task 2, their coordination with the field work in Task 1, and the establishment of the database programme. From the beginning of September a project Secretary would be employed in Troms� OVERVIEW OF THE OUTCOME OF ICOS M.Heath gave an overview of the progress made during the ICOS project. Briefly, various models of the space/time variability in CPR data on Calanus species in the northern North Sea, Norway, F�roes, west of Scotland area have been developed and compare well with the results of field surveys carried out in the spring. It is clear that Calanus finmarchicus invades the North Sea from the north along the western side of the Norwegian Trench. Field surveys in the winter have explored in detail the deep water distribution of diapause C.finmarchicus in the F�roe-Shetland Channel area, and the emergence from deep water in the spring. A good understanding of the space/time dynamics of this process is now available. This has been embodied in a particle tracking model, driven by flowfield results from a nested pair of hydrodynamic models. The outer model encompasses the whole north Atlantic and Norewgian Basin at a resolution of approximately 30km. The Inner model covers the core area of interest in ICOS (North Sea, F�roe Plateau and south western Norway) to a resolution of 14km. Partial validation of the flowfield in the F�roe-Shetland Channel from CTD and ADCP data has been carried out. Results from the particle tracking models clearly show the highly restricted nature of the overwinter sources of particles simulating the migration of Calanus which successfully enter the North Sea. Particles entering the northern North Sea have a source distribution which corresponds in part to that of overwintering C.finmarchicus in the field, whilst those entering the northwestern North Sea through the Fair Isle Channel have a source distribution more closely resembling that of C.helgolandicus. The final phase of ICOS will be to test the particle invasion success to climatic scenarios simulated by the hydrodynamic models, and relate the variations to long term trends in Calanus derived from analysis of CPR data. HISTORICAL DATA ANALYSIS (subtask 1.3) Potential providers of data gave an overview of what was available at their institutions. Russian data held in Murmansk (presented by K.Tande) The data are summarized in a paper by Degterev, 1979. (The work was translated by Dr Sergei Timofeev at the USSR Academy of Sciences, Murmansk Marine Biological Institute). Data maybe available for the abundance of Calanus (ind. m-3) in the surface layers (0-50m) in the time-periods every year (April-May; June-July). Data are given (Degterev, 1979) as means for each of 5 transects. In each there are 10-20 separate observations/stations but the values for these are not reported separately. Transects cover the distance from the Norwegian Coast to Bear Island and from Lofoten to Murmansk. There are also data for ova, nauplii and copepodite stages of Calanus finmarchicus for the same time-periods and conditions. Data are long-term (30 years) NB. Degtereva, 1979 only 18 years. Degtereva data goes from 1957 to 1977. The taxonomic resolution of these data maybe rather poor but we do not yet know. Raw data rather than aggregations from Degtereva (1979) would be more useful. Temperature and some flow data maybe available and a relationship between warm years and cold years has been noticed (literature?). Problems of obtaining this information would be small relative to the potential use of the data. Can the Russians visit any of the partners? Better to go to Russia first and investigate the quality (particularly taxonomic resolution) of the data prior to investing time/money bringing Russian scientists to UK etc. E.McKenzie offered to visit Murmansk in the near future. There are no other data available for that far North. We must have the Russian data. A.Gislason mentioned that a Russian Research Vessel visits Iceland every year during a large survey of the Norwegian Sea. They also look at the hydrography of the area and these cruises have been happening for decades. Why do we not know about them? This data sounds very valuable. Is it possible to get the data and have they been published? Some PLAN is needed to go about obtaining these data. E. McKenzie and K. Tande offered to investigate. F�roese data (E.Gaard) Plankton sampling began in 1989. Data are resolved into copepodite stages. Biomass data are also available. Data were collected along 3 standard transects and there are typically 4 cruises each year in February, May, August and November. Three different water masses are sampled: (1) the North Atlantic Current dominated by C. finmarchicus; (2) the East Atlantic Current also dominated by C.finmarchicus and (3) the coastal/neritic seas on the shelf. Data are valuable for validating CPR models. F�roese also have good CTD data available to TASC. Data are availabe in digital form. Format not known but this is irrelevant. Icelandic data (A.Gislason)Since 1961 the Marine Research Institute, Skulgata has been doing spring surveys all around Iceland. Surveys began in the seas north of Iceland but were extended to the south. Data are collected at around 90 stations along 9 transects radiating from the Icelandic coast: 5 are in the north and 4 are in the south. Cruises are annual and take place during May and June. There is warm North Atlantic Current (NAC) data south of Iceland and colder water in the north where there is also a variable input of warm NAC. Interesting relationships here. Data are collected by vertical plankton net hauls (0-50m). Biomass estimates are made using displacement and stage distribution per sample is ascertained with "short-cut" method. Zooplankton scientists at MRI have published some papers based on data collected during these surveys and Astthor has aggreed to circulate them to other partners. Possibility of some confusion between C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus north of Iceland. Relative importance of biomass of C. finmarchicus could be estimated from the data. Astthor would like to investigate the importance of offshore vs. inshore spawning. For each sample, the first 100 animals of a randomly selected subsample are staged, sexed and identified. Species nos. are then converted to species biomass composition. (NB. This is also the case for the F�roese data.) Hydrographic data and chlorophyll data are also available. It will be necessary to convert data to species absolute abundance. Astthor has begun to get the data digitized and they will be available on EXCEL files. There is no ADCP data but temperature and salinity data are available and have been stored with ICES. SU will consider assembling the hydrographic data. Variability in zooplankton abundance is weakly linked to fish stocks and Astthor is trying to pin-point these connections. Again worried about contamination. Samples could be examined again in more detail as they still exist physically. NB. C.glacialis is not common and C. helgolandicus is almost certainly not there, cf. CPR records.

Variations in zooplankton densities in Icelandic waters in spring during the years 1961-1982. Rit Fiskideilar, 7(2):73-113. Continuous Plankton Recorded Survey data (Ben Planque) CPR recorder and protocol was described. Mesh-size used is 290. C. finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus were only separated post-1957. Small aperture of the entrance of the recorder vs. large exit port limit the effect of clogging on the performance of the recorder. Routes and data-coverage in space and time are highly variable. A sample is analyzed every 20 miles. Calanus CV and adults are combined into one class in the survey. Data are recorded as "recorded values". Numbers of samples in the North Atlantic are quite high. How are species in the CPR survey discriminated? Each species is examined individually. Each is picked out from the silk strip and examined separately under the microscope. E. McKenzie thanked the "data-providers" because the information has been very forthcoming. Where do we want to focus our efforts? Spring is very important. Can we convert Iceland, F�roese, pre-ICOS and ICOS cruise data and Russian data into CPR recorded values and produce pictures using all these data combined?. How much will the data cost? and can we get all the data right up to the coast of N. America? E. McKenzie has already agreed to a limit with Chris Reid just west of Iceland. E. McKenzie will have to go back to the CPR and get more data. Focus must be on Calanus finmarchicus. SUMMARY Russia Iceland F�roes CPR Spatial coverage 5 standard transects from Norwegian coast to Bear Island and from Lofoten to Murmansk. 10-20 observations along each transect. 9 standard transects radiating from Icelandic coast. Around 90 stations. 3 standard sections radiating north (14 stations), west (14 stations) and east (8 stations). Since 1994 a 4th has been done from S. F�roes to Fair Isle. Data from some heavily sampled (every 20 miles) tow-route available S. of the F�roes, S. of Iceland with some west of Greenland. Temporal coverage 1959-1977 1961-present 1989-present 1958-1995 Taxonomic resolution Maybe poor Maybe contamination by C. glacialis. No C. helgolandicus. Reliable Reliable? (Need to explain the presence of C. hel. in CPR data south of Iceland) Stage resolution Population divided into ova, nauplii and copepod stages for certain transects. Sexes? Information available on stage composition and sexes. All adults sexed and copepodite stages resolved; but only the largest naupliar stages are recorded. CV and CVI are lumped. No animals sexed. Availability of hydrographic data Possibly available available available NA CROSS SHELF DISPERSAL MODELLING (subtask 1.5) a) PARTICLE TRACKING Preliminary areas of interest: Iceland-Scotland Ridge Northwestern Norway South-eastern Iceland Northern North sea Background to work other than that described for ICOS Onshelf-offshelf Eulerian Calanus Model (D.Slagstad): The model is an advection-diffusion system based on a fixed Eulerian grid in which Calanus stage abundance is a state variable, and is driven by Eulerian data from a hydrodynamic model. The model has been used for northern Norway and was originally designed for the Barents Sea. The animals were placed deep offshore and were shown to enter the shelf at points where deep trenches cross the shelf break. The model was connected to a phytoplankton model which empirically drove the timing of egg production. From the model results, the area adjacent to the Barents Sea appeared to be a potentially very important overwintering area, although there are no field data to validate this. These animals would be transported into the Barents Sea. There seems to be a connection between production in Norwegian Shelf areas and the Barents Sea. The Barents Sea seems to be seeded west of Norway. Objectives of the particle tracking work in TASC a) Geographical Objectives Target shelf areas in TASC , governed by the availability of data on Calanus distribution, and corresponding potential overwintering areas are as follows: Target shelf area Potential overwintering area Norwegian Shelf between Bergen and Lofoten: Data available from CPR, survey data from IMR, and TASC cruises. Eastern margin of the Norwegian Sea, both north and south of Lofoten; F�roe-Shetland Channel. South and southwest Iceland: Good data are available from all around Iceland, and C.finmarchicus seems to be widely distributed. In terms of total plankton biomass, northern and eastern areas are likely to be influenced by Metridia and C.hyperboreus. After some deliberation, it was decided that it would be necessary to define target areas around most of Iceland. Southern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge. Are there any overwintering Calanus in the overflow plume from the F�roe Bank Channel?. Could such a source supply the south coast of Iceland?Open Atlantic south of Iceland, in particular the Labrador Sea water mass. We do not know whether there are any overwintering Calanus in this area, but if there are then could they colonise the south Iceland shelf?.Northern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge and southwestern Norwegian Sea. Do these areas supply the eastern or southern Iceland shelf.?Denmark Strait, west of Iceland. Is this an overwintering area, and if so, which part of the Iceland shelf could be colonised from this area? F�roe Plateau: Data available from CPR and from F�roese field surveys and from TASC cruises. The highest Calanus concentrations in spring around the F�roe Islands occur to the north and west of the islands. However, Calanus is distributed all around the F�roe shelf. Calanus nauplii are likely to be transported around the north of the F�roes to the eastern F�roese shelf, after hatching in the north or northwest. F�roe-Shetland Channel and F�roe Bank Channel probably supplies the F�roe plateau.Southern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge. Are there any overwintering Calanus in the overflow plume from the F�roe Bank Channel?. Could such a source supply the F�roe Plateau?Open northeast Atlantic, in particular the area between Rockall Bank and F�roe Bank. Are there any overwintering Calanus in this area? If so, then they could contribute to the F�roe Plateau population.Northern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge and southern Norwegian Sea. Do these areas supply the F�roe Plateau? Northern North Sea: Data as in ICOS, and from first TASC cruise. F�roe-Shetland Channel source well defined from ICOS.Open northeast Atlantic, in particular the area between Rockall Bank and F�roe Bank. Are there any overwintering Calanus in this area? If so, then they could contribute to the northern North Sea. This is the major unknown factor emerging from ICOS. b) HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING In TASC, IfM will develop three hydrodynmaic models. As in ICOS, the requirements of particle tracking will be met by a nested pair of fixed level models, the coarse outer model providing boundary data for the finer inner model covering the main area of interest. The third type of model will be a layer model, in which the layers represent water masses rather than fixed depths. This will be used to model the overflow of water across the Iceland-Scotland Ridge. a) Large-scale level model: The large-scale model in ICOS was vertically-integrated. This model will be vertically-resolved in TASC. The vertical resolution of the model has not been decided yet, but the number of layers will be minimised (probably to 3, although more might be needed). If necessary, ice formation at high latitudes (west coast of Greenland) will have to be taken into account explicitly. b) Medium-scale level model: This will cover a similar area to that in ICOS (Iceland-Norway), but at a finer resolution (7.5' (lat.) and 15' (lon.)). The finer resolution is necessary to better resolve the F�roe Bank Channel. This model does not fit very well the new intended source areas, which are in any case very close to the model boundaries. It might not be possible to extend the model westwards towards Greenland because of the prohibitively large number of extra grid nodes involved. It is not possible to sacrifice model areas to the south in order to give extra coverage to the north because of the absolute necessity to include the North Sea which has a large influence on the shelf edge flow west of Norway. Therefore, it will probably be necessary to use coarse model data for particle tracking close to Greenland and allow particle to move between coarse and medium scale model grids. c) Layered model: The layers are not fixed in this model, but follow each water mass. A preliminary version of this model has already been developed in connection with another project, and it will be applied to the Iceland-Scotland Ridge overflow in TASC. In TASC, a climatological mean annual cycle will be modelled, thus providing a time-dependent flowfield. Anomalous situations can also be simulated with a time-dependent flowfield. This modelling work is very dependent on the atmospheric data set, which will not be available until July. Additional freshwater input data are also desperately needed for west of Norway and for the UK and Ireland. c) SOURCE AREAS AND METHODS OF STUDY (A) Norwegian shelf The sources of overwintering animals which invade the Norwegian mid- shelf could be the F�roe-Shetland Channel, the eastern Norwegian Sea, and/or west of Lofoten. Overwinter distribution will be derived from Task 2 (large scale surveys), whilst the routes and timing of invasion will be determined from field surveys and particle tracking. (B) Iceland (east) Is the source of the spring distribution of animals located to the north or the south? Sampling and particle tracking will be used to answer this question. (west) Sampling of the distribution of Calanus can be carried out. Particle tracking experiments could only be done if the appropriate flowfield data are available. (C) F�roes Possible sources are F�roe Bank Channel and/or the Norwegian Sea. This could be resolved with the use of particle tracking. (D) North Sea The role of the open northeast Atlantic as an overwintering area for animals invading the North Sea is unresolved, and should be addressed in TASC. In all, there are 9 possible sources, two of which will be difficult to explore due to the proposed coverage of the medium scale hydrodynamic model. It seems to be very difficult to design a single medium scale hydrodynamic model which will cover all these sources to adequate resolution. In discussion it was noted that in fact it was the need to resolve the F�roe Bank Channel which placed the main constraint on the model. It was therefore suggested that variable spatial resolution might be a way forward - with fine resolution in those areas that demand it, and coarser elsewhere, thereby allowing the overall model area to be increased without detriment to the number of wet grid nodes (which determined the computational demand). However it seems that this could cause additional problems such as "reflections" (equivalent to "internal boundaries"). Another possibility might be to improve the vertical resolution of the large-scale model, mainly in the shallower layers, in the critical areas of interest FIELD PROGRAMMES (Subtask 1.1, 1.2, 1.4) S.Jonasdottir presented the main results from the first DIFRES/MLA cruise under subtask 1.1 which was carried out 12-29 March 1996. The main objectives were to determine the distribution, development, physiological state and production of C. finmarchicus in relation to oceanographic features and primary production in the northern North Sea, along the southern coast of Norway and at the F�roe Plateau.Calanus finmarchicus was mainly confined to the surface waters of the northeastern North Sea and the deep waters in the F�roe-Shetland Channel. Off the shelf edge it was observed ascending to the surface. Higher phytoplankton biomass values were observed in the Norwegian Coastal Current. This was also the area of highest egg production rates of C. finmarchicus. There was good correlation between chlorophyll biomass and C. finmarchicus egg production. The following table of planned surveys was assembled during the meeting: Dates Sub-task Partners Survey area 18 Nov -19 Dec 1996 1.1 MLA/DIFRES Potential overwintering areas northeast Atlantic/southern Norwegian Sea; overflow across Iceland Scotland Ridge and F�roe Bank Channel 25 Nov - 5 Dec 1996 1.2 MRI Two transects south and west of Iceland 10d Feb 1997 1.2 MRI Two transects south and west of Iceland 15d April 1997 1.4 UIT� Norwegian shelf M�re to Lofoten 7d March 1997 1.1 FLF F�roe Plateau 15-30 March 1997 1.1 MLA/DIFRES F�roe - south and southwest Iceland 10d April 1997 1.2 MRI Two transects south and west of Iceland 15d May 1997 1.4 UIT� Norwegian shelf M�re to Lofoten 30d June 1997 1.4 UIT� Norwegian shelf M�re to Lofoten 10d June/July 1997 1.2 MRI Two transects south and west of Iceland There was general support for trying to standardize the sampling and the sample analysis within TASC as far as possible. For example it will be important that all the members of TASC use the same mesh sizes in their nets, especially when carrying out quantitative sampling. As to the taxonomic analysis, the procedures of the different labs should be intercalibrated and tested using blind samples. We should also standardize the procedures for the measurement of egg production and gut fluorescence. The methods used to estimate phytoplankton biomass and production need also to be comparable. Further, it is important to have proper quality assurance of the CTD-data. A.Gislason agreed to collate the sample protocols from the different institutes in Task 1 into one coherent document of recommended TASC-procedures. The different institutes under Task 1 (DIFRES, MLA, FLF, UIT�) will send their protocols to Iceland before Friday April 19. They will then be assembled as a basis for a TASC Methodology Protocol which will be circulated to partners in both task 1 and task 2 before Friday 26 April, for comments. K.Tande will prepare the members of task 2 for this. INTEGRATION OF DISPERSAL AND POPULATION MODELLING Four types of population models potentially in use during TASC were identified together with their associated forcing and physical setting data: Biological model Forcing data Physical setting Circle map models - probabilistic models of the phasing of spawning times in relation to periodicity in the environment Long-term time series of temperature, irradiance, food at particle locations. Particle tracking through temperature, food and irradiance fields. Empirical models - growth or egg production linked to temperature of food concentration by empiraical relationships Time series of temperature and food concentration along particle trajectories. Particle tracking through temperature and food fields. Semi-structured population models - population composition modelled as a series of weight classes (for example) Eulerian data on temperature and food at fixed nodes, or time series of temperature and food along particle trajectories. 3-dimensional advection and diffusion rates at fixed Euleroian grid nodes, or particle tracks through temperature and food fields. Fully structured population models - population composition modeleld as a matrix of age/weight or age/length classes Eulerian data on temperature and food at fixed nodes, or time series of temperature and food along particle trajectories. 3-dimensional advection and diffusion rates at fixed Eulerian grid nodes, or particle tracks through temperature and food fields. Problem areas which should be discussed at a workshop: Time and space dependent phytoplankton forcing data are essential for any biological modelling exercise. These could be dynamically modelled from hydrodynamic data, nutrients and irradiance, but this would be major undertaking and by no means certain of success. Alternative are to assemble phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll) data from historical and contemporary field sampling and either grid them directly onto a space-time matrix, or statistically model them in time and space. Sources of phytoplankton biomass data are: CPR greenness index ICES hydrographic database national institute databases TASC cruises SU agreed to investigate the aquisition of greenness index data from SAHFOS. Any Eulerian model implementations will require data on horizontal diffusion rates for each grid node (vertical diffusion, and advection terms are already available). The horizontal rates must be parameterised from the variance in velocities over a tidal cycle at each node. At present, the hydrodynamic models implemented by IfM do not include tides. This is because they have a minimal influence on the residual circulation in the area of interest. It was proposed to conduct a barotropic run of the hydrodynamic models with tides included to extract the component of circulation due solely to tides. It was noted that large (ocean) scale hydrodynamic modelling work was planned in both Task 1 and Task 2. The work in these tasks will make use of completely different model systems, but the results on the sacle of the whole Norwegian Sea basin should be comparable. It seems essential that the investigators involved in these Tasks coordinate the preparation of initial and forcing data, and agree on a common set of evaluation criteria. CLOSING COMMENTS K.Tande reminded the meeting that although all the discussion had referred to cross-shelf transport during the spring as C.finmarchicus is emerging from diapause, thre are also important quetions to be answered regarding the cross-shelf transport as the species enters diapause in the summer and autumn. C.Miller (USA) and R.Harris (UK) have requested a joint meeting of the North American and European sides of TASC. It had been proposed to hold this during the ICES Statutory Meeting in Iceland in October, but the meeting found mopre favour with the idea of combining it with the first annula general meeting of TASC at the end of the first year. Due to sea committments in subtask 1.1, this would have to be in January 1997, and ICES headquarters were proposed as a venue. A provisional data for the modelling workshop was agreed as the week commencing 19 August, and SU agreed to host the meeting at the Ross Priory conference centre on Loch Lomond, Scotland. Relevant parties from Tasks 2 and 3 would be informed of the dates by K.Tande. Mike Heath will be the organizer of terms, and provide the project with the agenda in the first half of June. K.Tande also reminded partners present at the meeting to remember to send a brief description of their institutes to him for inclusion in the WWW page on TASC, and to prepare a few slides on their subtasks for inclusion in a project presentation set. In this connection, the possibility of producing a project brochure along the lines of the ICOS brochure was discussed. This document was prepared by M. Heath. Back to Table of Contents TASC Database meeting at IMR, Bergen, June 7 1996 TASC DATABASE MEETING AT IMR, Bergen, June 7 1996 PARTICIPANTS: Arne Vidar Brekke (IMR), Bj�rnar Ellertsen (IMR), Rune Espelid (IMR), Helge Sagen (IMR), Kurt Tande (UiT�). AGENDA: 1. Status and a general overview of dbase (Tande) 2. Strategy for implementation of a system (Sagen/Brekke) 3. Quality assurance of CTD data (Sagen) 4. Detailed plan for preparing the dbase concept at the First Steering Committee meeting in August (Sagen/Brekke) CONCLUTIONS: 1. Status and a general overview of dbase. Tande reported from his recent meeting at ICES, where he got the impression that ICES expected a database which was easily accessible for the users. They also expected that WWW was incorporated in the database, and based upon their experience from ESOP a.o., ICES could assist in the set up of the database. ICES themselves are interested in CTD data only, they are not involved in managing other kinds of data within TASC, which is IMR's responsibility. TASC will have to give first priority to biological data collected within the TASC period, historical data, included CPR-data, will be dealt with at a later stage. 2. Strategy for implementation of a system. Brekke informed about the IMR database at present, where JGOFS software is being installed. As a basis for the TASC database we agreed that the data model already existing at IMR, with the necessary adjustments for zooplankton data, would be suitable for the TASC purpose. Brekke will be in touch with the partners in order to discuss to what extent there is a need to implement further data modelling in addition to what the model already cover. With regard to the technical solution for receiving data from the partners, Sagen suggested that IMR should accept the documented data in the format that the individual institutes at present could offer, and that IMR thereafter should import/convert data into the IMR database. There is a need now for IMR to know what kind of data we should expect to receive in the future, and what units will be used (i.e. pressure for depth, etc.). The IMR data group find that it is more time-saving for the TASC community as a whole that IMR convert the data they receive from the partners, instead of expecting the partners to deliver their data on a given definite format. To make data more accessible over Internet a stepwise solution was suggested: 1) TASC-data in the IMR database will be "exported" to world wide web by means of US GLOBEC software (JGOFS). Data will be presented as a static structure, sorted by cruise, date etc. Today this solution is used by several research institutions. JGOFS is sufficiently user friendly to serve all involved institutions which wants access to the TASC data. 2) To improve accessibility and applicability of the IMR TASC database, there is a need to produce a "dynamic" interface to the data base. This may be achieved in two ways: a) developing a web-based client-server software b) developing a Ingres client-server software Client-server software will make it possible to search the database, i.e. to collect data from discrete positions (areas) regardless of cruise, date etc. According to the TASC Technical Annex the partners wil send SQL packages to the IMR TASC server. This was regarded as an impractical solution. If SQL packages are to be received, SQL statements must be filtered before they enter the database. 3. Quality assurance of CTD data (Sagen)At present only quality controlled data, i.e. data produced according to IMR protocols, are implemented in the IMR database. It was decided that the TASC data in the IMR database must be of a similar quality level, and when TASC data are to be added to the database, these data need to be controlled in advance by the individual institutes. ICES, which is especially interested in CTD data, demands high quality of such data, and have their own handbook for CTD quality control. According to R.Espelid, who recently had visited ICES, ICES is also discussing an integrated data base system, and may very well end up with a database similar to the IMR's. 4. Detailed plan for preparing the dbase concept at the First Steering Committee meeting in August Sagen/Brekke will produce and distribute a note concerning the further strategy for the implementatioin of a data base system before July 1. A dbase group will be established as soon as possible, and tentative members should be M. Heath (MLA), 0. Asthorsson (MRI), UiT� (one person), DIFRES (one person), Dag Slagstad, SINTEF, G.Hopwood (ICES), H.Sagen and A.V.Brekke (IMR). Their dbase concept will be made available for circulation to the members of the steering commettee by August 5. This was compiled by Bj�rnar Ellertsen.

Backhaus and Dagmar Hainbucher Investigations within EU-project ICOS have confirmedthe three-dimensional and time dependent succession of Calanusfinmarchicus in the vicinity of the NW-European Shelf. Theobservations of ICOS also suggest that the succession is not confinedto the shelf/slope region but has a continuation towards Iceland.The topographies of the Faroe-Shetland Trough and Faroe Bank Channel,to the north of the Wyville Thomson Ridge, can be visualised asa continuously narrowing duct, or funnel. It channels the overflowof NSDW to the south of the Faroes and provides a source regionfor an injection of hibernating Calanus into the northernNorth Atlantic, south of the Greenland Scotland Ridge. The densityof the NSDW overflow water, having passed the ridge, is higherthan that of its ambient water masses. The overflow water, therefore,descends as a bottom-arrested gravity plume on the sloping topographywith only a small (ageostrophic) angle between its path and depthcontours. Water masses of this plume are discernible as far asthe Reykjanes Ridge, south of Iceland. On its way the plume meetsother overflow water which has crossed the ridge to the west ofthe Faroes. These known hydrographic features have implicationsfor the succession of Calanus finmarchicus. It is likelythat both plumes, initiated by the overflow, are transport vehiclesfor hibernating Calanus, thus providing a link betweenshelf and oceanic stock. With the ascent of Calanus, atthe end of hibernation, it leaves the overflow plume and getsdispersed within the surface circulation of the northern NorthAtlantic. Prevailing south-westerly winds cause an Ekman drifttowards the European coast whilst Calanus reproduces inthe euphotic zone. For hibernation Calanus descends intothe Norwegian Sea deep water (NSDW) and might, hence, return tothe overflow regime described above. To gain further insight intothis new branch of the Calanus succession a modelling techniquefor the simulation of gravity plumes, recently developed for thesimulation of slope-convection in high latitudes, will be appliedin TASC, in conjunction with the HAMSOM (general circulation)model and field observations. The oral contribution will be splitinto two parts: description of hypothesis and of oceanographicdata sampled during VALDIVIA cruise #160. Jan O. Backhaus and Dagmar Hainbucher: Institut fuerMeereskunde, University of Hamburg Vertical distribution and mortalityrates of Calanus finmarchicus during overwinteringin fjords with different predator regimes Espen Bagøien, Stein Kaartvedt, Ketil Eianeand Dag L. Aksnes Fjords typically have a deep basin and a shallowouter threshold. Thus, the deep water may be resident during prolongedperiods, with little or no exchange with other water masses. Fjordstherefore provide excellent opportunities for studies of biologicalprocesses. The focus of this study is vertical distributionsand mortality rates of the calanoid copepod Calanus finmarchicus,in relation to invertebrate and fish predators during overwintering.We test the hypotheses that mesopelagic fishes (Maurolicusmuelleri and Benthosema glaciale) are major predatorson Calanus during overwintering, and that Calanusselects overwintering depths so that predation from mesopelagicfish is minimised. The studies were carried out in four Norwegian fjordswith varying topography, as well as different predator regimes.The two visually hunting mesopelagic fish prevail in certain depthstrata in three of the fjords, while these fish are lacking andtactile invertebrate predators prevail in one of the fjords. Mesozooplankton were sampled by vertical net hauls,while distributions of fish and large invertebrates were registeredby acoustical methods. Sound scattering layers were identifiedby trawling, and temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a concentrationand light extinction was measured. Preliminary results demonstrate marked differencesbetween the fjords. Calanus was most abundant in the fjordwithout mesopelagic fish predators, where high concentrationswere found in depth strata occupied by fish in the other fjords.

D. Bryant, M. Heath, W. Gurney, D. Beare and W.Robertson A weight structured population model is describedfor Calanus finmarchicus. Results are presented for anarea of the northern North Sea for which detailed stage successiondata exist, and are discussed in the context of other models ofzooplankton population dynamics for that area. The essential simplicityof the model enables embedding in a 3-dimensional hydrodynamicscheme representing the northern North Sea (1 degree x 1 degreeboxes, split into upper 30 m and below). Results of this spatiallyresolved model are discussed in the context of a new statisticalanalysis of C. finmarchicus late-copepodites from the ContinuousPlankton Recorder Surveys. A.D. Bryant and M.

Robertson: Departmentof Mathematics and Statistics, University of Lancaster, UK Large-scale patterns of population genetic diversityand structure of Calanus finmarchicus in theNorth Atlantic: prospects for study based on results from theNW Atlantic Ocean A. Bucklin, S.P. Franzen, A.M. Bentley and R.S. Hill Based on the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, Calanusfinmarchicus exhibited very low levels of molecular populationgenetic variation. Both the number of mtDNA genotypes (calledhaplotypes) and the genetic divergence between haplotypes weresignificantly lower than these values for other copepod speciesassayed for the same gene. Statistical evaluation of geographicpatterns of genetic diversity revealed no evidence of significantpopulation genetic structure within the NW Atlantic. Ongoing studiesare examining these results using different molecular populationcharacters, including additional mitochondrial and nuclear genes.Our conclusion is that C. finmarchicus is transported rapidlyacross the NW Atlantic, effectively homogenizing the populationacross this region. In contrast to homogeneity within the NW Atlantic,there were significant differences between the genetic makeupof NW Atlantic populations and NE Atlantic populations, regardlessof the method of statistical analysis. The genetic divergenceof C. finmarchicus populations on either side of the NAtlantic suggests that the population dynamics, including reproductionand recruitment, may be distinct. The large-scale population genetic structure of C.finmarchicus may be investigated using a variety of geneticapproaches; the comparison of results using several genetic characteristicsis desired to ensure the validity and robustness of the result.Large-scale geographic patterns of population genetic diversityand structure may reveal the underlying population dynamics ofthe species as a whole, in terms of reproduction, recruitment,and dispersal. A. Bucklin, S.P. Franzen, A.M. Bentley, R.S. Hill:University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA Growth and development rates of Calanusfinmarchicus in the laboratory and on Georges Bank R.G. Campbell, E.G. Durbin, M. Wagner, J.A. Rungeand S. Plourde Nitrogen and carbon specific growth rates and developmentrates were determined for individual stages of the copepod Calanusfinmarchicus reared at different temperatures and food concentrationsin the laboratory. Growth rates decreased with increasing stageof development. At high food levels carbon specific growth rateswere greater than nitrogen specific growth rates, while underfood limited conditions both rates were similar. Development rateswere equiproportional, but not isochronal. Naupliar stage durationswere similar, except for non-feeding stages (N1-N2) which wereof short duration, and the first feeding stage (N3) which wasprolonged, while copepodite stage durations increased with increasingstage of development. On Georges Bank during Jan-June 1995 developmentrates and carbon and nitrogen specific growth rates decreasedwith increasing stage of development as in the laboratory experiments.C5 growth rates were similar to carbon and nitrogen specific eggproduction rates of adult females. Development rates within agiven stage increased slightly as water temperatures warmed, butno relationship with chlorophyll-a concentration was observed.Carbon and nitrogen specific growth rates were more variable andshowed no significant relationships with temperature or chlorophyll-a.Addition of a mixed phytoplankton diet resulted in significantincreases in growth rates while development times were not affected.There were no differences observed in mean growth or moultingrates between different regions of the bank for C1-C4 copepodites,while rates for C5 were significantly lower on the shallow crestthan on the flank regions.

Casas Depth-stratified zooplankton samples were collectedfrom Georges Bank with a plankton pump and a 1 m2MOCNESS during 1995 as a part of the US-GLOBEC Georges Bank programme.All developmental stages of Calanus finmarchicus were enumerated.Recruitment of Calanus began in late December/early Januaryin the southern GOM with the new generation being advected ontoGeorges Bank in the region of the north-east Peak. This wintergeneration spread along the south Flank reaching maturity in lateApril and May. Abundance of nauplii in these regions of the Bankwas at a minimum during May, followed by a large second generationin June. Calanus did not appear in the central well-mixedregion of the Bank until March and then disappeared again in May.In this region of the Bank episodic wind events appeared to beresponsible for the recruitment of Calanus during the winterand high predation rates for its disappearance during the spring.On the north-east Peak and south Flank of Georges Bank the generalcirculation provides a pathway for a continuous and predictableinput of Calanus from the Gulf of Maine. E. Durbin, P. Garrahan, M. Casas: Graduate Schoolof Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, South Ferry Rd, Narragansett,RI, 02882 Visibility and predation pressure Kjetil Eiane We investigated two equally sized fjords of differentpelagic food web structure. Lurefjord is dominated by the jellyfishPeriphylla periphylla, while fish predators dominate inthe other fjord, Masfjord. Due to a slightly stronger influenceof coastal water in the Lurefjord, the light absorbance of thisfjord is two to three times higher than in other fjords. Thisresults in a reduction in light flux of several orders of magnitudeeffectively reducing the possibility of visual fish foraging.The tactile mode of predation in jellyfish, however, is not influencedand we hypothesize that the visibility regime has a decisive rolein structuring pelagic food webs. Kjetil Eiane: Department of Fisheries and MarineBiology, University of Bergen, Bergen High Technology Centre,N-5020 Bergen, Norway A model of optimal life history decisions anddiel vertical migration in Calanus finmarchicus Ø. Fiksen and F. Carlotti A copepod in a seasonal environment continuouslyface the trade off between allocating surplus growth to a storagecompartment (lipids), somatic growth or to reproduction. By buildingup lipids, it can survive periods with low food, and gain reproductivesuccess the following season by transforming fat to eggs. Also,copepods face a trade off between survival and growth, as surfacewaters generally are more risky and less productive than the darkrefuge in greater depths, both in the diel- and annual temporalscale. Implicit in these trade-offs are the numbers of generations,population dynamics and productive potential of the copepod. Wedevelop a model which find the optimal phenology and verticalmigration for a copepod (Calanus finmarchicus) in differentenvironments, using the Perron Frobenius Theorem and dynamic programming.The model predict diel- and ontogenetic vertical migration tovary with season and individual state.

Gifford During the 1997 field programme, we will evaluatethe taxonomic distribution of diet of the feeding naupliar stagesof Calanus finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp. onGeorges Bank. The research is framed in the context of off-Banksources and on-Bank retention of nauplii. We hypothesize thatGeorges Bank provides an enriched dietary environment for naupliirelative to their source regions in the adjacent Gulf of Maine.Manipulative experiments will be done to evaluate diet and measurerates of ingestion and growth. As we can't sort nauplii to speciesfrom field collections, we will use a method pioneered by RubenLasker, rear nauplii in the lab, control their growth rate withtemperature, and bring them to sea for use in experiments withnatural prey assemblages.

Astthorsson The poster presents preliminary results from thefirst MRI TASC-cruise to the area south and west of Iceland. Themain purpose was to study the vertical distribution, conditionand population structure of overwintering Calanus finmarchicusboth on and off the shelf in relation to the physical and biologicalenvironment. The station activity involved hydrographic measurementswith a CTD, phytoplankton investigations with fluorometers andsampling for chlorophyll-a, zooplankton sampling usingdepth stratified. Multinet-tows from the bottom to the surface,gut fluorescence measurements and incubations for egg productionmeasurements. Further, acoustic measurements for the distributionand abundance of mesopelagic fishes (as potential predators onC. finmarchicus) were conducted. Astthor Gislason and Olafur S.

Head and L.R. Harris Zooplankton (>200 mm) were collected between 0-100m (spring 1994, 1996; summer 1995; fall 1996) and 0->1000 m(fall 1996) at stations on a section between Hamilton Bank (Labrador)and Cape Desolation (Greenland). In spring and summer Calanusfinmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreusaccounted for >75% of the biomass. C. finmarchicus wasalways the most abundant, reaching levels of ~10 g C m-2.C. glacialis occurred only over the Labrador and GreenlandShelves, and the biomass of C. hyperboreus was much greaterin 1996 than in 1994 in the central Labrador Sea. Lengths andweights of CV C. finmarchicus varied considerably throughoutthe sampling area, but showed no consistent variations with insitu temperature or chlorophyll concentration. A similar rangeof sizes have been observed for CV C. finmarchicus on theScotian Shelf (Halifax Line) and size may prove a marker for sourcepopulations in future studies of C. finmarchicus dynamicson the Scotian Shelf.

Heath: SOAEFD Marine Laboratory Aberdeen PO Box101, Victoria Road, Aberdeen, UK An overview of the ICOS project (EU MASTII projectCT94-0088, July 1994-June 1996) Mike Heath The ICOS project adopted a three stranded approachto investigating the life cycle of C. finmarchicus. First,the overwinter and spring distributions, demography and biologyof the species were investigated by field sampling. Second, theresults of the field programme provided some of the parametersfor a hydrodynamic and particle tracking model study. Finally,the wider area spatial, seasonal and long term variability inC. finmarchicus abundance was investigated by a detailedanalysis of Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) data. The focusof the project was an analysis of the extent to which the long-term(1955-1994) changes in the abundance of C. finmarchicusin the northern North Sea could be explained by the results ofa particle tracking model driven by regional flowfields and long-termclimatic data. The geographical focus of the project was the Faeroe-Shetlandregion, incorporating the northern North Sea, Faeroe-ShetlandChannel, southern Norwegian Sea, and neighbouring parts of thenorth-east Atlantic. The conclusion of the project was that the generalprinciples of the hypothesis proposed by Backhaus et al. (1994)are correct. Concentrations of C. finmarchicus in the shelfwaters are low during winter months, and these animals are inpoor condition. The majority of the population is found at depthsgreater than 600m beyond the shelf edge, associated with NorwegianSea Deep Water (NSDW) in the Faeroe-Shetland Channel. Invasionof the North Sea from these overwinter concentrations is possibleunder certain climatic conditions. The particle tracking model predicted that the highestconcentrations of copepods in the spring should occur in the Atlanticinflow at the northern end of the Norwegian Trench, and this wasconfirmed by field sampling and from CPR data. In addition, long-termtrends in C. finmarchicus abundance in the North Sea inspring were shown to be primarily related to north-westerly windswhich control the invasion from overwintering depths in the Faeroe-ShetlandChannel. Both the incidence of north-westerly winds and the observedspring abundance of C. finmarchicus have shown a steadydecline since 1955. A second order effect appears to be a probabledecline in the abundance of overwintering C. finmarchicusin the Faeroe-Shetland Channel associated with an unprecedenteddecline in the supply of NSDW which commenced around 1967. Mike Heath: SOAEFD Marine Laboratory Aberdeen POBox 101, Victoria Road, Aberdeen, UK Copepods going in circles: an investigation oflife-cycle characteristics Aladair Hind and Bill Gurney The synchronicity of successive generations withina population of Calanus finmarchicus will be investigatedusing a circle-map model. This technique is suited to representingthe life-cycle characteristics of multi-stage species in a periodicallychanging environment and the underlying concepts will be explained.Rather than tracking the progress of individuals in a populationthe model follows the life-history of a lineage through successivegenerations, making it very efficient when used in simulations.Initially the model will be applied to fixed locations at variouslatitudes in the North and Norwegian Seas, although later workwill apply the model to particle tracking investigations.

Carlotti A system was used for examining growth and developmentalrates of a Calanus finmarchicus cohort. The experimentswere carried out from 27 March-8 May 1996 at the Marine BiologicalField Station, Bergen, Norway. The enclosures contained each 18.5m3 of sea water.Two enclosures were stocked with C. finmarchicus naupliirepresenting the stage composition NI-NIII. Nutrients were addedto the enclosures resulting in a chlorophyll range between 3 and18 g l-1 andthe temperature increased from 4.5-7°C during the experimentalperiod. Stage duration in the cohort and carbon and lipid contentof the dominant developmental stages were measured every fourthday. During the 43 days experimental period the naupliar stagesdeveloped to CV and adult males and females were also observedat the end of the period. Growth of Calanus finmarchicusfrom nauplii to CV will be discussed. B.H. Hygum and B. Hansen: Roskilde University, Departmentof Life Sciences and Chemistry, PO Box 260, DK-4000 Roskilde,Denmark C.

Houlihan Calanus finmarchicus copepoditestage V was collected on the continental shelf north of Shetlandand across the shelf into the Faeroe-Shetland Channel on fouroccasions from December 1994 to May 1995 and in the North seain March 1996. Physiological parameters for the overwinteringand active population of animals where determined. Laboratorymeasurements of oxygen consumption of the animals were made attemperatures similar as in the field and at different temperatures(0°C, 5°C, 7°C and 10°C) to determine theeffects of temperature changes on the overwintering animals. Theeffects of food availability on metabolic responses at the timeof arousal were measured. Animals collected from the overwinteringpopulation showed very little response to changes in temperature.The active surface population in May had noticeably higher respirationrate than in any of the respiration experiments for the deep wateranimals. Slight increase was detected in respiration of fed animalsto starved. Measurements were made of dry weight and samples takenfor chemical analysis to determine the composition of the population'scarbon and nitrogen content. Due to the low respiration demands,the decrease in carbon content in diapausing CVs was very low.Carbon and Nitrogen seemed to be used up in the same proportion(approximately 10:1, respectively). Results from ongoing analysiswill be presented. A. Ingvarsdottir and M. Heath: SOAEFD Marine Laboratory,PO Box 101, Victoria Road, AB9 8DB, Aberdeen D.F. Houlihan: University of Aberdeen, Tillydrone Avenue, AB92TN, Aberdeen Contents and depletion of lipids in Calanusfinmarchicus during overwintering in the North Atlantic Sigrun H. Jónasdóttir and KatherineRichardson Lipid concentration of the copepod Calanus finmarchicuswas measured during autumn, winter and spring in the Faeroe-ShetlandChannel during the ICOS project. As stage V C. finmarchicusdirects all energy into storing wax esters (WE) before enteringdiapause in autumn, the space and time concentration of WE inCalanus stage V and females allows us to calculate theutilization rate of lipids and estimate the potential length ofdiapause and cost of maturation and ascent to the surface. Additionally,changes in lipid classes (WE and triacylglycerols) could possiblybe an indication of initial biological activity in spring. DuringTASC samples will be collected in order to further develop a modelon lipid utilization of Calanus finmarchicus during springtransition. Sigrun H.

Madden The geographical and vertical distributions of fourspecies of Calanus were investigated in May 1994 in thenorthern North Sea and to the north-west of Scotland. These speciesshowed distinct differences in their distribution in the studyarea. C. finmarchicus was the most abundant species throughoutthe area. Highest numbers were present in offshore areas of thenorthern North Sea and Faeroe-Shetland Channel. C. helgolandicuswas in contrast most common in the inshore stations. C. hyperboreuswas less abundant than the former two species and was restrictedto the most northerly transects. C. tenuicornis was onlyfound in very small numbers, to the north-west of Scotland. Juvenilestages of C. finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus predominantlyoccurred in the upper layers of the water column, where the chlorophyllconcentration was highest. The adult stages shared a similar distributionin some stations while they displayed a wider vertical distributionin other stations. The results of the study demonstrate that thedistribution of these H. Madden: SOAEFD Marine Laboratory Aberdeen PO Box101, Victoria Road, Aberdeen, UK Additive Modelling of CPR data for Calanus E. McKenzie and D. Beare The use of modern Additive Models in the analysisof raw Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) data for the two calanoidcopepods Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicuswill be described. The proponderance of zeroes in the data, aswell as the particular problems associated with the recordingprotocol are adequately handled. In the first approach to be described,data are aggregated prior to analysis into arbitrary spatial compartments(boxes) and the time-dependence is modelled as a function of long-termtrend and seasonality. In the second method, all the CPR dataavailable (56-64°N and 13°W-11°E) are consideredsimultaneously and variables of location (longitude and latitude)are incorporated as continuous random variables, rendering theuse of spatial compartments unnecessary. The approach providesnew insights of the spatio-temporal distribution of Calanusin the northern North Sea and the results of the models will bediscussed mainly in this context. E. McKenzie and D. Beare: Departmentof Statistics and Modelling Science, University of Strathclyde,UK CPR data and diel vertical migrations: statisticalconsiderations E. McKenzie and D. Beare Diel vertical migration (DVM) occurs in a great varietyof marine and freshwater zooplankton. The typical pattern is migrationfrom greater depths during the day to shallower depths duringthe night. The functional significance of this very common behaviouralpattern has been the subject of debate and a range of hypotheseshave been promulgated to explain the phenomenon. Predator avoidance,light, temperature or a need to ascend to the surface waters tofeed on more abundant phytoplankton have all been put forwardas explanatory factors. It is known that the DVM behaviour ofzooplankton can react very rapidly to short-term (seasonal) changesin environmental conditions but it is less widely accepted, however,that slow, long-term changes in variables such as predation intensityhave resulted in long-term changes in the degree of DVM behaviourin zooplankton. Quantifying the influence of DVM in data collectedby the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey is an extremelycomplicated statistical problem requiring very careful treatmentfor many reasons. The distribution of CPR data in space and timeis non-random, there are many missing values, there are many zeroesand the duration of darkness and of daylight co-varies with theseasonal cycle. We demonstrate how modern Generalized Linear Modelscan be used to overcome some of these problems. To simplify interpretation,the data are first divided into individual months and modelledas a function of long-term trend and a two-level factor for daylightand darkness. The modelling procedure reveals that the signalfrom DVM is very strong in the summer and weak in the winter.In addition, we show that DVM behaviour is independent on long-termtrend and that in general the signal is rather weak and may beignored.

Beare: Department of Statisticsand Modelling Science, University of Strathclyde, UK Developmental progress by cohorts of Calanusfinmarchicus in the vicinity of Georges Bank, evaluatedby age-within-stage analysis based on postmoult and tooth formationfacies in mandibular gnathobases Charles B. Miller and Jennifer Crain Calanus finmarchicus copepoditesform new teeth before each moult by a morphogenetic sequence duringthe last third of the intermoult interval. Immediately after moult,for the first third of the intermoult interval, the mandibulargnathobase contains a large, readily seen hemocoele space. Thus,by examination of their mandibles, copepodites can be assignedto one of three, roughly equal phases in the moult cycle: postmoult,intermoult, or tooth formation. We have done this twice for samples(N=30) of each copepodite stage in vertically stratified net towseries (Z=3 or 4) from five stations of the US GLOBEC Broad ScaleSurvey of Georges Bank and the southern Gulf of Maine. The proportionsof jaw phases for April 1995 show: (1) that the developmentalprogress of a population cohort, a mixture of late-spawned firstand early-spawned second generation individuals, was at the samestage throughout this wide region of coastal ocean, and (2) thatthe cohort was making developmental progress throughout the 12day duration of the cruise. Proportions for April 1996 (data incomplete,more to come) show majorities at the end of the moult cycle inall stages. Tentative interpretation is that development had beenarrested at some point, presumably by food limitation, then restarted,forcing all stages to the same phase. Fifth copepodites beforeand during the rest phase retain the postmoult facies, which isthus a mark of resting status. Fractions of the stock with postmoultsignatures rise throughout the spring and early summer. Some individualscompleting development in every part of the active season areentering rest, while others mature. The division progressivelyfavours rest as the season advances, but even some July individualsmature and reproduce. The promise and problems of classificationsbased on gnathobase facies will be discussed. Charles B.

Experiments were carried out to study theeffect of starvation and food on egg production. In addition,samples from October, December, January and August were analysedto complete knowledge of the reproductive history of females.Female gonad development started during February. By the end ofMarch all females were mature. At this time the highest egg productionrate (28 eggs f-1d-1) was measured.Until May the egg production rate decreased to 0. Then the mainproportion of the females were immature. In comparison to fjordsin Northern Norway, spawning occurred earlier and the egg productionrate was remarkably lower in the Lurefjord than in Northern Norwegianfjords.

Tande The state of gonad development in copepodids IV andV and adults were studied together with the volume of oil sacsand gut fullness in Calanus finmarchicus (CF) and C.hyperboreus (CH) from a north Norwegian fjord in monthly samplesfrom February to December 1992. Reproduction in CH occurred earlierthan in CF, where the former did not feed at that time. Lipidcontent of CH decreased in March, when copepods started feeding.A maximum in feeding activity was reached in April, with lipidreserves increasing dramatically, especially in the upper waterlayer. From late spring onwards, the population of CH was representedby copepodids inhabiting the deep layers. Lipid content of CF,decreasing in March-April, was still low in June. Lipid reserveswere built up in July, and more 'fat' individuals were found atdepth. Sexual differentiation in CVs commenced in August, wheregonad development was associated with changes in lipid content.Both species entered the overwintering period as CIVs and CVs. A.F.

Tande: University of Tromsø, 9037Tromsø, Norway The importance of life cycle strategies and advectionfor the geographical distribution of Calanus finmarchicus- a model study Ole-Petter Pedersen, Dag Slagstad and Kurt Tande The main objective of this paper is to study theeffect of life cycle strategies and advection on the geographicaldistribution of Calanus finmarchicus on the Norwegian mid-shelfsector. Daily, simulated averages of the flow field and temperaturesare used as model input. A simple biological model calculatesthe rate of development as a function of temperature. Integratingthis rate, the life stage is found which again determines theontogenetic vertical migration and the mortality rate. Initial distribution of particles, representing animalsof the same stage of development, are placed in the southern NorwegianSea (The Norwegian Basin) at the 600 m depth interface. Animalsmigrate to the surface and start spawning and their offspringsare released in the advective field. After this cohort (G1) hasreached CV there are two options. The G1-generation could chooseto moult into adults and produce a second generation (G2) or selecta vertical migration behavioural pattern ending in diapause. Theeffects of the various options on the geographical distributionof C. finmarchicus are investigated by running a numberof sensitivity tests.

Planque The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominantmode of interannual climate variability over the North Atlanticocean. This atmospheric phenomenon is characterised by two extremestates, the low NAO state during which, westerly winds are weakerand temperature colder over northern Europe and the high NAO statewhich displays a reverse climatic pattern. The state of the NAOis commonly measured by NAO index, the standardised sea levelpressure difference between the Azores (high pressure centre)and Iceland (low pressure centre). In the north-east Atlanticand the North Sea, abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicusmeasured by continuous plankton recorders during the past threedecades is strongly related to the NAO index (r=-0.76, P<0.01).This strong weather-plankton link suggests a 'short' connectionbetween weather changes and Calanus response. Several explanationscan be evoked to elucidate the link between NAO and Calanus.Evidence from satellite measurements and models of oceanic circulationare given to highlight the validity of these different scenarios.

Richardson, S. Jónasdóttir, S. Hayand M. Heath Measurements of Calanus finmarchicus egg productionhave been made on 6 cruises carried out between 1993 and 1996and spanning the months of October-March. Concommitant measurementsof phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll) and primary productionwere also carried out. These data allow us to examine and compareegg production at the end of the productive season and that occurringat the beginning of the growth season. Egg laying females wereobserved in October, January, February and March. However, onlyin October and March were the numbers of females in the watercolumn large enough so that the estimated Calanus egg productionrates exceeded 500 m-2.In October, the highest water column egg production estimateswere made in 'offshelf' waters while in March, the greatest watercolumn production rates were observed in slope waters. At thebeginning of the growth season, egg production rates normalisedto individual female were clearly correlated with food availability(chlorophyll). This was not the case in October. It is suggested,however, on the basis of measure phytoplankton standing stockand the known grazing efficiency of Calanus that ingestionof phytoplankton in during March was, in itself, not sufficientto fuel the egg production rates measured.

Runge, S. Plourde and E. Durbin As part of the US-GLOBEC Georges Bank programme,egg production rates of Calanus finmarchicus were measuredduring process cruises to Georges Bank occurring approximatelymonthly between January and June, 1995. Females were spawningcontinuously during this period. The median, wt-specific ratewas highest in February-March (10.5% d-1); at othertimes it varied between 5.5% d-1in January to 8% d-1in June. Females were capable of sustaining egg production undermost environmental conditions in the Georges Bank region. Theegg production rate measurements were used to calibrate the reproductiveindex, which is based on the proportion of females in preservedsamples carrying oocytes in advanced stages of vitellogenesis.The relationship, which was highly significant (r2=0.74), was used to hindcast female-specificegg production rates during the GLOBEC broadscale cruises, whichsampled a grid of ~40 stations monthly during the same January-Juneperiod. The product of the female-specific egg production ratewith the female abundance yields the daily input of eggs intothe water column (eggs m-2d-1). Geostatisticaltechniques were used to map the spatial distribution of egg productionduring each survey. The results show both spatial sources of recruitmentinto the population and variability of the Calanus preyfield for fish larvae in the Georges Bank region. J.A.

Durbin: School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island,Narragansett, RI 02882, USA Seasonal change of spawning habitat by Calanusfinmarchicus in Mid-Norwegian waters Stig Skreslet Calanus finmarchicus isconveyed from south to north by the Norwegian Coastal Current.During autumn parts of the stock invade deep fjords inside theMid-Norwegian shelf, situated between Trondheim and the LofotenIslands, to spend the winter. They start spawning in April whilethey are still in the wintering habitats, but probably drift withtheir offspring into shelf habitats as freshwater outflow increaseswith the snow melting rate, peaking in June. In 1995-96 fieldwork was carried out to investigate whether or not the specieswas spawning on the shelf itself, during summer. Observationson the Lofoten shelf from March to August 1995 established thatnauplii were produced during the whole summer, mostly on the innershelf. Observations in late July 1996 confirmed summer reproduction,but at the shelf break front. The spatial difference may be dueto an abnormally low freshwater outflow in 1995, causing frontsto be established closer to the shore. In late July 1996 observationswere also made on the inner shelf, farther south, where the Mid-Norwegianshelf is very wide. There, very active spawning occurred in ahyaline front established over a slope descending from the coastalarchipelago to the shelf itself. The slope front probably extendedalong the entire coast, possibly providing spawning conditionsfor C. finmarchicus all the way. Considering how the shelftopography varies with its banks and trenches, it may be expectedthat spawning habitats may also be established in hydrographicalfronts over the shelf itself, including the shelf break. Thus,it is hypothesised that the Mid-Norwegian shelf may be a majorsummer spawning region for the stock of C. finmarchicusthat inhabits the Norwegian Sea. It is also hypothesised thatthe fjords spring-spawning generation is a precursor, charginga larger number of spawners into the shelf's summer-spawning generation.To what extent the second generation mixes with first-generationmembers that drift onto the shelf from the continental slope duringsummer, is a matter of speculation. Stig Skreslet: Department of Fisheries and Science,Bodø College, N-8002 Bodø, Norway A routine molecular method for identificationof Calanus species? -theoretical basis and expectedpotential Rolf Sundt Occasionally accurate identification of Calanusspecies, based on morphological characters, can be difficult andlabour demanding.

To evaluate the interest for such a methodto be developed, the theoretical basis for and expected potentialand limitations of a possible method are described.

Crain andC. Morgan Adult females were examined from November throughspring at sites near Georges Bank (41=BAN) and in Northern Norway(70=BAN) for the fractions with each of the quadrithek and tritheksetal patterns on the antennule. The quadrithek pattern is a malecharacter in which odd numbered, proximal segments carry two aesthetasscsas well as two setae; the trithek pattern has one aesthetasc onall antennular segments. Frequency of quadrithek females (%Q=3D100x Q/ {Q+T}) varied with both location and season. It peaked at13% in January on Georges Bank then declined gradually to 6% byJuly. In Northern Norwegian fjords (Grøtsund outside Tromsø)the early winter maximum was 38% declining to 25% by March. Thus,the ratio between quadritheks and tritheks varied seasonally atboth sites. It was consistent that higher proportions appearedearly, that is, among the first females emerging from the stockof resting copepodites. In the light of the hypothesis by Flemminger(1985) that females with the quadrithek pattern result from sexswitching by genetic males, we tested whether %Q in newly moultedfemales could be altered by separate exposure or the maturingCVs to adult males or females. The experiments were run with animalsfrom Grøtsund during the last three weeks prior to moultingof CVs. Of females not exposed to adults as CVs, 35% were quadritheks,while those exposed to adult males and females produced 33% and37% quadritheks, respectively. Based on the present data, thesex ratio of adult C. finmarchicus did not seam to influencethe proportion of females with male characters in the experiment.No evidence for sex specific pheromones was found and the stimulusfor sex change is therefore not revealed. Alternative explanationson sex change are suggested and discussed. C. Svendsen and K.S. Tande: University of Tromsø,Norwegian College of Fishery Science, 9037 Tromsø, Norway C.B. Miller, J.

Thomas Torgersen and Stein Kaartvedt Abnormally coloured Calanus were observedin the Oslofjord throughout the late summer and early autumn 1996.The exoskeletons were enervated by a deep red colour, while theprosome was filled with a yellow/orange mass, closely resemblingearlier descriptions of Ichthyophonus-infections in Calanus.Histological analyses of the infected animals also showed thatthe abnormally coloured animals were infected with Ichthyophonus,a parasite with uncertain taxonomic position. The infected individualsshowed an active orientation towards the surface layer and becameaccumulated in convergences and close to land in locations ofshorewards surface-currents. The visibility of prey to a visuallyhunting predator increases with light intensity and contrast withthe environment, but three-spined sticklebacks did not prey moreefficiently on infected Calanus than on not-infected individualsin the laboratory. Ichthyophonus is known to infect manyfish species, including herring with high prevalence of the parasite.A mechanism of infection in zooplanktivorous fish may be throughpredation on infected zooplankton. This would imply that the parasitewill benefit from altering host colouration and vertical distributionas shown here. Whether Calanus' active orientation towardsthe surface is directly induced by the parasite, or merely a consequenceof, for example, increased needs for food awaits further studies.

Campbell, and E.G. Durbin RNA content may offer a simple way to measure growthrates of zooplankton. We are currently examining the relationshipof RNA to growth rates and physiological condition in Calanusfinmarchicus. We have found that RNA:DNA ratios of Calanuscopepodites reflect food concentrations in laboratory culturesand that there are seasonal changes in RNA:DNA ratios of C4 andC5 Calanus on Georges Bank. In addition, the RNA:DNA ratiomay be a good indicator of diapause. Our current work is aimedat calibrating the relationship of RNA with growth rate and atusing RNA to assess growth rates and relative condition of C.finmarchicus in the Georges Bank region throughout 1995. In a recent laboratory experiment, we monitored growthand development of C. finmarchicus over the entire lifecycle at a range of temperatures and food concentrations. In additionto measuring development rate and carbon and nitrogen growth,we measured RNA, DNA and protein for copepods cultured from eggto adult. Preliminary results indicate that food concentrationwas the primary factor influencing RNA content. Temperature hadlittle effect on RNA and DNA content and RNA:DNA ratios. It shouldbe possible to formulate a linear model, involving temperatureand RNA, which can be used to estimate growth rates of C. finmarchicusin the field. To assess the relative condition of C. finmarchicusover the year and to relate condition to growth rate, egg production,and environmental factors, we surveyed RNA:DNA ratios of copepoditeand late naupliar stages from Georges Bank and nearby Gulf ofMaine during 1995. Copepods were sampled on monthly GLOBEC zooplanktonprocess cruises between January and June, and again in Octoberand November. Mean RNA:DNA ratios of C. finmarchicus onGeorges Bank increased over the period from January to June. InJanuary, RNA:DNA ratios of CV and adult female Calanuswere fairly homogeneous over the Bank and in the surface layersof nearby Gulf of Maine stations. By late May, however, ratioshad increased substantially in most areas of the Bank, but didnot change much in the off-bank regions. At stations in the Gulfof Maine and Slope Water, RNA:DNA ratios were always lower forcopepods in the deeper layers (>100m) than for those at thesurface. Changes in RNA:DNA ratios over the season appear to beconsistent with changes in food availability and growth ratesof Calanus copepodites. M.M. Wagner, R.G. Campbell, and E.G.

What is TASC ? The objective of the international GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) Programme is "to understand ocean ecosystem dynamics and how they are influenced by physical processes so that the predictability of the population fluctuations in a changing global climate can be assessed". The aim is to promote large scale research into the effects of ocean climate change around the world. The programme of work in the north-east Atlantic presented here represents a co-ordinated European response to the GLOBEC initiative. Links with equivalent studies in the north-west Atlantic will be carried out through ICES. The objective is to understand the physical and biological processes which control the population dynamics of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, a key zooplankton species in the north-east Atlantic. Establishing the relationship between the physical and biological factors affecting annual recruitment and reproduction of the species is an essential step towards predicting the consequences of future climate change. Hypotheses developed to address the linkage between physical processes and C. finmarchicus population dynamics are: The interaction between vertical migrations and shelf edge hydrodynamics determines the ability to C. finmarchicus to seasonally colonise north-east Atlantic shelf ecosystems from overwintering depths in Norwegian Deep Water off the shelf edge. Year-to-year variations in the timing and dynamics of shelf populations are dependent on oceanic and shelf scale forcing. The deep circulation in the Norwegian Sea Basin and overflow into the north Atlantic is responsible for a "teleconnection" between C. finmarchicus summer populations in north-east Atlantic rim ecosystems. Latitudinal gradients in abiotic conditions and interactions with predators control large scale differences in overwintering behaviour. The large scale demography, life history timing and generation cycle characteristics of C. finmarchicus are related to the basic physiology of the species in relation to feeding conditions and the pattern of entry to and emergence from diapause. The project will test these hypothesis in a number of different settings around the North Atlantic Rim, in particular, off southern Iceland, the Faroe Plateau, the northern North Sea and along the Norwegian midshelf. The work programme combines laboratory and mesocosm investigations of nutrition, growth and reproductive biology with both large and small scale field studies. The accumulated knowledge will be synthesised in a range of modelling tasks and the results set in context by reference to statistical analysis of long term time series data. Three approaches will be adopted: field investigations, mesocosms and laboratory experimentation and modelling. Field investigations will include mapping the distribution and physiology of the species in relation to hydrography during the winter spring transition period. A coordinated and comparative time series field sampling programme covering one year will also be conducted at selected locations in the Norwegian Sea and bordering shelf. The above will provide insights into regional and temporal differences in the population biology of Calanus. Studies in mortality rates and behaviour at selected sites will be addressed with high temporal resolution using conventional net systems and acoustics. Mesocosms will be used to study basic growth patterns and for assessment of latitudinal differences in physiology. These systems may provide information enabling identification of environmental cues governing life cycle patterns along latitudinal clines. Laboratory activity will concentrate on establishment of cultures of the species, to enable the studies of multiple generation Calanus population dynamics in the laboratory. The controlled culture experiments will enable us to determine the influence of environmental and dietary factors on several aspects of population biology of Calanus. Several different model approaches will be applied, including hydrodynamic models encompassing both large and mesoscale processes. Sensitivity analysis will examine the scope for variability in climatological forcing at a variety of scales. Lagrangian model simulations will be run to define particle tracking routes as defined with behaviour pertinent to the various phases in the life cycle of Calanus. A bioenergetic model will be synthesized. A circle-map model of the Calanus life cycle will be developed, and will, together with particle tracking dispersal model enable us to explore population synchrony in relation to the periodicity of the forcing environmental singals.

By Roger P. Harris Plymouth Marine Lab. Plymouth PL1 3DH United Kingdom Dear Calanus colleagues, Inspired by the report from Mike Heath and KathyRichardson from the heavily rolling DANA (TASCNewsletter No.2) here is a further report from thefront-line of Calanus research. This comes from a10oC constant temperature room at the University of Bergen field station at Espegrend, where we arecurrently spending six hours each day, counting finmarchicus eggs. Conditions are more stable thanthey were on the DANA, but it is still a cold, damp way to spend the day. Why are we doing it? Weare participating in a mesocosm experiment as part of a UK-funded project called PRIME (PlanktonReactivity in the Marine Environment). What is PRIME? The aim of PRIME is to lay the basis for mathematical models to describe the roleof plankton in determining those biogeochemical fluxes within the oceans which play an importantrole in climate regulation. Ultimately such models may allow accurate predictions to be madeconcerning the impact of plankton on climate change, as it is increasingly recognised that theactivity of plankton may profoundly influence the levels of many chemical compounds in the oceanand so affect gaseous air/sea exchanges. Within this broad framework, PRIME will obtain new insights into the structuring of planktoncommunities and develop new approaches towards the modelling and observation of planktonic processes. As such PRIME is planned to proceed by iterations between theory and observations, withthese observations being made in both semi-natural mesocosms and in natural oceanic communities.PRIME has initially been funded for a period of 4 years by the Natural Environmental ResearchCouncil and is bringing together laboratories and University groups from throughout the UK to focusand co-ordinate their research efforts. PRIME is examining the nature and distribution of the major functional groups of marine plankton andthe regulation of these functional groups by physical, chemical and biological processes. Assuch, innovative methods of sampling form an integral part of the programme. Techniques beingexploited include flow cytometry, acoustics, molecular probes and optical plankton counters. Such techniques will be combined with simultaneous automated collection of a variety of physico-chemical parameters. In the initial phase of the project, during 1995, mesocosm experiments are being conducted in semi-natural predefined conditions (our reason for coming to Norway). By manipulating the physico- chemicalconditions in the water, a variety of planktonic communities and processes are being simulated. These experiments are serving as a testing ground for many of the new methodologies and approachesand will also provide the initial data for the firstgeneration models to describe and predict planktondynamics. Following the foundations laid by this year's mesocosm experiments, field work will beconducted in oceanic regions. The first PRIME cruise is planned to take place in the North Atlanticin the summer of 1996. In situ observations will be combined with satellite imagery and historical datasets. This will allow the development of models to describe and predict the biological variability andrate processes on a basin-wide scale. Why has PRIME come to Norway? The University of Bergen has a very effective mesocosm facility atEspegrend, which has previously been the focus of successful and productive experiments on thedynamics of coccolithophores as part of the EU-funded MAST-II EHUX project. Hence,Espegrend was an obvious site for our 1995 experiment, and PRIME placed a subcontract withthe University of Bergen to run the experiment under the supervision of Jorun Egge from theDepartment of Fisheries and Marine Biology. A short small-boat ride from the lab where we are working is the raft supporting the eight mesocosmswe are working with. These are 2 m in diameter with a depth of 4.5 m, so their volume is about11m3. Replicate mesocosms have been fertilized with nutrient additions with differing N:P ratios, toproduce divergent phytoplankton assemblages. The experiment was started on 5 June and is expected toend on 6 July. At present very different assemblages, dominated by diatoms and coccolithophores, have been achieved,and are being sampled intensively for the range of PRIME projects represented by the team of 15participating scientists. These include: studies on the characterisation of marine viruses; biogenic gasproduction in phytoplankton blooms; the development; parameterization and testing of ageneric, size-structured plankton model; pigment chemotaxonomy of phytoplankton biochemistry; theuse of modelling techniques to assess the nature of carbon acquisition by marine phytoplankton;partitioning inorganic carbon assimilation and primary production in the euphotic zone; and lastly,the reason why we are sitting in the cold room, our own project on polyunsaturated fatty acids and thenutritional basis of trophic links in marine plankton. What are we doing? Our PRIME project is a collaborative one with John Sargent's group at theUnit of Aquatic Biochemistry, University of Stirling, in Scotland. It aims to determine levels and rates offormation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in marine phytoplankton in the laboratory, in mesocosms andin the field and to model the results in terms of production, conversion and transmission of PUFAby planktonic processes. In particular we are interested in the relations between the compositionof the diet and zooplankton production. In the experiment we (myself, Dave Pond, Chris Harris and Kathryn Cook) are collecting particulatematerial from each enclosure on a daily basis for PUFA analysis, measuring egg production by adultfemale C. finmarchicus from each mesocosm, and collecting eggs for lipid analysis. To obtain enoughmaterial for analysis, the experimental protocol involves triplicate incubations of groups of 20females for each mesocosm. Egg production rates are high, and every egg has to be isolated with aPasteur pipette, which is why two of us are spending 6 hours at 10oC each day. With egg production rates in excess of 50 eggs/female/day a single replicate may yield morethan 1000 eggs for sorting (record to date 1359), a days work a harvest of more than 10,000 eggs(record to date 13,770 in one day), and by the end of the experiment we should have over 70,000 handpicked eggs in liquid nitrogen. Is this a record? Once these have been shipped back on the ferry tothe UK, and subsequently analyzed at Stirling, we hope they will yield insights into the nutritionallinks between the biochemical composition of the diet and reproduction. We hope that this will leadinto studies proposed for TASC and doubtless many more C.fin eggs will be counted during the life ofthe Trans-Atlantic Studies of Calanus finmarchicus. Back to Table of Contents Good News - European TASC Project funded by EU-MAST Program By Kurt Tande Norges fiskerih�gskole Universitetet i Troms� 9000 Troms� Norway TASC will be funded by EU, and the budget is wasonly slightly reduced from that proposed. We willhave 3 mECU with which to work. We have just recently concluded negotiations around theTechnical Annex, and all of the proposed work plans are still intact. We had to adjust some of theactivities according to the new budget situation, but the changes were mild. The contracts will be signedat the end of November, and the anticipated start will be in the first quarter of 1996. We are actuallybeginning to advertise positions and preparing the ground for this big event! I will have to give priority to establishing the communication lines by the beginning of January,but we do not intend to wait until the money has arrived in the respective labs. We are about to starton the planning process, taking the most urgent first. I have emailed a mild signal to the partners,encouraging them to start the next planning phase. The most important topic is the experimental task(TASK 3) where we will have to conduct some important preliminary mesocosms tests in Bergenthe coming spring. I therefore spent a lot of time last week working together with Francois Carlottiduring the EUROMARKET meeting in Sorrento and with Benni Hansen in Copenhagen in order to startplanning the experiments. Benni will have a draft ready by the end of November on the mesocosmexperiments with Calanus. There is a great need for starting to interact more specifically with you on theother side of the Atlantic, and we will do so after the turn of the year. I have also the news that the position for North Atlantic Programme Coordinator will be advertisedin Science in the very near future, and will be open for a senior scientist in the field for 2 years. (Editor's note: ICES advertised this position for a "North Atlantic GLOBEC coordinator", withapplications closing on 31 Dec. 1995.) Back to Table of Contents The Mesh Size Survey By Charlie Miller, TASC Newsletter Editor College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences Oregon State University Corvallis, OR 97331-5503, USA internet: cmiller@oce.orst.edu Last summer I posted an inquiry to the TASC email reflector, inquiring about the selection of mesh sizefor study of Calanus. The EU-TASC program proposal specified that 0.200 mm mesh would be usedfor their oceanic sampling, while the U.S. GLOBEC Georges Bank Program selected 0.150 mm mesh. Thisdiscrepancy may make some problems in intercomparison of data between programs. Fromresponses to my inquiry, the reason for the difference appears to be different program interests. EU-TASC net sampling is strongly focussed on copepodite stages of Calanus, while Georges Bankstudies also target Pseudocalanus copepodites. Before going further, let me take account of Ted Durbin's reply. He insists, and is doing the work toback it up, that population analysis that neglects nauplii is losing too much information, particularlyif the purpose of the study is to characterize the food available to larval fish. For estimates ofnaupliar abundance Ted is pumping water through an on-deck 0.050 mm filter. This gives good retentionof even Pseudocalanus first Nauplii (N1). It is fully adequate for Calanus eggs and nauplii.A note from Mike Heath suggests that the 0.200 mm choice of EU-TASC is traditional: "I don't supposethat any thought went into the choice of 0.200 mm for nets. It's just common practice....For the ICOSwork we used 200 �m, but then we are working in the winter and only looking for Calanus. The vastmajority are in stages 4 and 5 at that time of year, but we know from other studies that we happilyretain stages 1 and 2." Wherever this tradition began, it was strengthened by the use of 0.200 mmmesh in the design of the so-called Working Party No. 2 (WP-2) net for "smaller mesozooplankton"(Tranter, 1968) approved for various surveys by ICES, SCOR and Unesco. Cabell Davis gives the rationale of the Georges Bank program for its 0.150 mm mesh choice forcopepod sampling by MOCNESS: With 0.200 mm mesh, "the very abundant Pseudocalanus spp. andParacalanus spp., which are often the dominant prey items of [larval] cod, haddock and herring aregreatly undersampled.... A 0.150 mm mesh was chosen ... because all copepodite stages of Pseudocalanusspp. are caught quantitatively, allowing a demographic analysis that would otherwise not bepossible. The tradeoff in mesh selection is between catching relatively more small species and stages with finermesh and relatively less clogging by phytoplankton with coarser mesh. The 1995 experience onGeorges Bank suggests (as did Mike Heath in his note) that the difference in this regard between 150and 0.200 mm is slight. If, for example, the premier clogging culprit Phaeocystis pouchetti is about, anymesh will clog that will catch copepods at all. Careful study of the effects of mesh size goes back to Kofoid (1887, see Vannuci 1968), but criticalmarine studies came later. One of the more convincing is by Saville (1958), who had the brightidea of towing the net of interest (60 silk threads/inch) inside a more retaining net (180/inch). He presented the comparison of the coarser (inside) and finer (outside) catches as selection curves: Vannuci (1968) cogently summarized Saville's results: "... organisms are far more compressiblethan was supposed earlier. For example, the mean [50% loss] escapement of fish eggs of 1.403 mmdiameter is at a mesh width of 1.199 mm. However, Saville also showed that beads may alsopass through smaller meshes. For instance, he found the 50 percent release point of glass balls ofdiameter 0.261 mm to be at a mesh size of 0.222. Similar observations were recorded for fish larvaeand copepods. The curves obtained for glass beads are lower than for organisms. This indicates thatthe escape of organisms larger than the meshes is aided by the compressibility of the organisms andthe flexibility of the meshes, the latter accounting for the escape of glass beads." So far as I know,Saville's study has never been repeated for modern nylon nets. While he tried a closely spaced range ofmesh sizes in the laboratory (fish eggs and glass) it has never been done for in the field with a range oforganisms. Too bad. A recent study by Nichols and Thompson (1991) compared 76 cm diameter nets of 0.061, 0.090, 0.124, 0.190and 0.270 mm mesh towed side-by-side in the North Sea. The study seems to confirm (figure below)that 0.200 mm mesh should catch all copepodite stages of Calanus adequately, perhaps with some doubt leftby slightly lower mean numbers of C1 at 0.190 mm and definite loss of C1 at 0.270 mm. Sampling of allcopepodites of Pseudocalanus minutus was adequate at 124 �m with complete loss of C1-C3 at 0.270 mmand nearly complete loss of C1-C2 at 0.190 mm. Another, less recent study by Colton et al. (1980) compared catch results of bongo nets equipped withboth 0.253 and 0.333 mm nets. They also compared towing speeds of 1.5 and 3.5 knots. They foundmarkedly greater catches of zooplankton smaller than herring larvae at 1.5 knots, attributing them toreduced extrusion at lower speed. This is definitely to be kept in mind. Lars Hernroth responded to the internet inquiry by sending a reprint of his 1987 paper comparing thecatches of Nansen nets to WP-2 nets for the special fauna of the central Baltic. Since he did notdistinguish Calanus specifically, the results can't help us much. However, the study shows that themany older Baltic data from the Nansen net are underestimates, given the greater values produced byWP-2 when towed with it. Studies of mesh retention capability are not likely to win any prizes, and they are time consumingbecause of the number of samples that must be counted. However, given the tremendousinvestment going into Calanus (and Pseudocalanus) studies the next few years, it might pay forsomebody to repeat Saville's design with modern materials. Note that this design requires lesscounting than side-by-side tows, which suffer more from small-scale patchiness and subsamplingvariability. Somebody should do it, maybe I will. Thanks to everyone who responded to the Internet inquiry. I was informed by what you said, even ifyou weren't quoted directly. References Colton, J., J. Green, R. Byron and J. Frisella. 1980.

Back to Table of Contents Looking ahead By Charlie Miller, TASC Newsletter Editor College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences Oregon State University Corvallis, OR 97331-5503, USA internet: cmiller@oce.orst.edu The U.S. GLOBEC Georges Bank program is making definite progress with its principal goal. That is to discern the couplings of advection, mixing and thermohaline stratification (physics) with thepopulation biology of plankton. The group is studying the larval ecology of Cod and Haddockwith particular attention to their interaction with populations of Calanus finmarchicus andPseudocalanus spp., principal foods for larval fish in the region. This progress is under intense reviewas the research group comes up to its 15 January deadline for renewal proposals. This deadline ispreceded by sailing of our first 1996 cruise on January 9 (if we can get our government workersoff 'furlough'), so many of us have our proposals finished weeks ahead. The next issue of TASCNewsletter will include a brief review of the insights starting to flow from the Georges Bank study and alisting of hopeful component proposals for work in 1996 and beyond. The ICES Working Group on Zooplankton Ecology, chaired by Hein Rune Skjoldal, hasdeclared 1997 The Year of Calanus. That is to help scientists, agencies and intergovernmentalprograms to keep all of our component studies operational and on tasc (sic) at making Calanusfinmarchicus the best understood animal in the world ocean. To be effective The Year of Calanuswill need some publicity starting in early 1996. The next issue of TASC Newsletter will review therequirements and possibilities. Keep in mind, too, that a year will not be enough; they flash by.

The aim of the cruise was threefold: to educate undergraduate students in the handling of oceanographic instrumentation and in the collection and analysis of field data, to map the cold overflow from the Norwegian Sea into the Icelandic Basin as part of the �TASC� Project funded by the European Union, and to test a new submersible acoustic sound source to replace big explosive charges. The cruise was planned on very short notice after the cancellation of another cruise planned for the Norwegian Sea. VALDIVIA sailed from Hamburg at 10 a.m. on July 5, 1996, and set course for the Fair Isle Passage north of Scotland. During six stops the Rosette water sampler and the conductivity-temperature-depth sonde (CTD) were tested and some modifications to the system had to be made before it ran satisfactory. Underway surface temperature and salinity data were collected and reported to the German Hydrographic Institute. After passing the Fair Isle Passage on July 7, the first hydrographic section across the Faeroe Bank Channel was occupied the next morning. Water samples were collected at five depth levels and analysed for salinity and dissolved oxygen content, to provide calibration data for the CTD sensors. In the evening of July 8 the geophysical mooring was deployed in the deepest part of the trench at a water depth of 1200 m. The mooring consisted of two ocean bottom seismographs connected by a 1000 m long electric cable with five glass floats attached to. These floats were equipped with a small explosive charge that at predetermined times made the floats implode and emit the sound. The experiment was successful and all the instruments were recovered. The hydrographic work was continued with a section along the crest of the Wyville-Thompson Ridge and a section across the narrowest part of the Faeroe-Bank-Channel. At 8 a.m. on July 10 VALDIVIA went into the port of Torshavn for visit of the Fiskiranns�knarstovan, scientists of this laboratory also visited the vessel and discussed the scientific results of this cruise. At 7 p.m. the same day VALDIVIA sailed again from Torshavn to occupy a CTD section across the exit of the Faeroe-Bank Channel. Faeroe Bank was reached on July 11, and another section was run towards west to detect a possible deviation of the overflow water towards the south. As this was not found, we continued with a northward section about 30 miles west of the exit. Next followed a section parallel to the topography along the Iceland-Faeroe-Ridge which showed an overflow of cold water just west of the Faeroe Islands. The westernmost section about 100 miles west of the exit then showed two cores of cold water, the one originating from the ridge at around 600 m, and the one from the Faeroe-Bank-Channel at 1200 m depth. Associated with an atmospheric low pressure system wind speeds increased to more than force 9 and work had to be abandoned at 6 p.m. on July 13. Work was continued the next morning but the 12 hours time loss forced us to take the direct route to Reykjavik rather than running another section onto the slope of the ridge. As the weather improved quite fast during that day, we ran one more hydrographic section onto the Iceland shelf. The scientific work stopped at 4 p.m. on July 14, and the vessel arrived in Reykjavik at 8 a.m. on July 15. Scientists from the Marine Research Institute visited the vessel in the morning.

It is winter again, the low pressure systems are passing over the North Atlantic more frequently and the Scots and the Danes are getting ready to surf the swells. The research vessel DANA from the Danish Institute for Fisheries Research is heading for her second TASC cruise. Dana sails from Denmark November 18 loaded for a 5 week rock and roll adventure in the North Atlantic. After a short stop in Aberdeen where Scottish colleagues come aboard with their gear, Dana will head north on a Calanus hunt. The area of investigation will be between the Faeroe Islands and Iceland and will cover both sides of the Faeroe Iceland ridge and along the southern and eastern shelf of Iceland (see map below). The purpose of the cruise is to map the distribution and physiology of Calanus finmarchicus in relation to the hydrography and especially to establish the spatial extent of the association between Calanus and the different deep water masses in the area. A fine resolution vertical distribution of C. finmarchicus will be established, on a 60 mile grid. Calanus will be collected for lipid analysis at the same horizontal grid resolution and primary production mapped along with Calanus egg production measurements. After setting the Scotts free again in Aberdeen, Dana heads back home to Denmark to be in port December 19 right before Christmas. Ho, ho, ho!

VALDIVIA, 5th - 16th July, 1996. Institute fur Meereskunde will conduct a cruise with R.V. VALDIVIA into the overflow region between Iceland and the Faeroes, Cruise # 160 (Hamburg-Reykjavik). Thr cruise will take place from July 5th to 16th, 1996. About 170 CTD stations will be placed on sections across the overflow-plume emerging from the Faeroe-Bank Channel. Unfortunately no biologists but only oceanographers will be participating in the cruise. Amongst other aspects, the cruise serves us to define initial conditions for our reduced-gravity plume-model which we want to use in TASC to support our extended theory on Calanus succession developed in ICOS: Calanus finmarchicus is transported westward within the over-flow water, i.e. by the bottom arrested gravity-plume, which is aligned with the topography in a narrow filament south of the Iceland-Faroe Ridge. For later particle tracking simulations, the position of the plume will serve to define a "line-source" of overwintering C. finmarchicus at depth. With the ascent of C. finmarchicus in spring it leaves the well defined overflow water masses of the plume and gets dispersed by the circulation of the North-Atlantic. This provides the link between open ocean and shelf/slope stock of C. finmarchicus. The data of VALDIVIA cruise # 160 will be made available to the TASC community. Actually, this cruise of VALDIVIA I told you about is also partly a cruise for training of students. We therefore have made a cruise-stamp which is called TASC'nTEACH. Nice, isn't it? I shall send you a copy. Yes, and of course we would fill in the bloody Roscop forms, routine for us. The expected cruise track for RV Valdiva is shown on the figure. The cruise is nr. 160 and is conducted in the North Atlantic from Hamburg to Reykjavik, 5th to 17th of July, 1996 Cheers! Jan. Thanks Jan!

This region, where poverty is quite common, was taken by USSR after the famous Winter War. This region is experiencing a time lag of 70 years comparing to the Western World. Small villages where time has seized to affect the inhabitants are quite common. General impression of Karelia: Poor area with small villages, but very friendly people.

Water, Water, Everywhere !   Watering Procedures     Deep,  regular waterings are essential to develop a lush,  verdantlawn.  Lawn  sprinklers are a definite improvement over hand  watering.They  can  be  set  in  place to water as long as  necessary,  and  areespecially effective if placed on a timer.     The  amount of water used depends on how deep the roots of thegrass you are growing. If there is a drought, it is better, rather thansprinkling lightly, to water twice a week, soaking the soil to  a  mini-mum  of  4 inches, or not at all, for shallow watering causes roots  tospread  out near the top where they will be baked by the sun,  becomingunable to withstand drought.     A lawn which is watered thoroughly at regular intervals, and whosesoil  has  plenty of organic humus (organic matter converts into  humuswhich  makes the nutrient elements in the soil available to the grass),will  withstand  drought, and remain sound throughout  the  hot  summermonths.  Different types of soil need different amounts of water. Lightsoils  need more water because they drain so rapidly. Clay soils retainwater, so they need less.

When dealing with diseases, it's the cause which you must control,or  cure,  rather  then the effect (disease). I  will  not  attempt  todescribe  each  type of disease for you in this book.  There  are  manybooks  out  which do just that, instead I will point you in  the  rightdirection  since it has been my experience that you need not  know  thename  of  the  disease to treat it. Remember, all diseases are  treatedbasically  the  same way. As long as you treat the cause,  the  effectswill  disappear. If the disease is persistent after following the belowsteps then proceed on to the organic disease control section.   Always key into Nutrition First.     What are you feeding your plants and soil?

There is nothing like proper nutrition for proper health! Foras in  humans so it is with plants.      Always Seek Balance,     When things are out of balance,      Infestation and Disease occurs.     Balance is as important to the soil and plants as it is to humans.When  things are in balance,  stress is reduced and all things functionaccordingly.  The Good Guys and the Bad Guys      don't live in the same place.  Bad  bacteria and good bacteria do not share the same  soil.  Deadsoil  is  not  actually dead but instead contains the presence  of  badbacteria or fungi or any number of disease sources.     Avoid High Nitrogen Fertilizers.    The  continual  use  of chemicals in the soil eventually  destroysboth  the  bacteriological and biological balance  of  the  soil.  Alsopresent  are the salt deposits of the various fertilizers,  etc.,  usedthrough  out the years. This causes major changes in the ph  levels  ofthe soil effecting nutritional absorption by the plants. This will leadto  higher  stress levels in all things associated with this soil.  Theapplication  of not only high nitrogen fertilizers but the  applicationof  any  type  of fertilizer is very bad for the soil, the plants,  theinsects,  the animals, the birds and all humans involved. High nitrogenalso  promotes  the  various diseases found in the  garden.  Why?  Highnitrogen causes stress & imbalance in the soil & plants, the same way ahigh  sugar diet does in humans. The more natural the sources the  moreacceptable the supply.    Poor health and high stress of      plants are due to improper               nutrition.     The  stronger the plant the less the disease will affect it. Avoidusing  any chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, etc.  Chemicalfertilizers are not complete foods. They provide only a small amount ofthe  total  diet  required for healthy plant growth.  NPK  does  not  acomplete dinner for plants make!  Stressed Out Plants..   The  same  rules  of pest control apply to disease  controls,  thehigher  the stress, the greater the problem associated with it and  theharder it will be to control. Dead or Water Soaked Soil.  Amend with compost, rock dust and animal manure if available.  Youshould  have  plenty  of earthworms. Dead water soaked  soils  have  noearthworms. Compost and mulching will increase organic matter  to  soilallowing  bacterial  and nutritional resources  to  increase.  Increasedrainage.    Practice soil rotation if possible. Rotation of  crops  issuggested whenever possible. If a raised bed is used allow the  bed  togo fallow for one season.  Some Diseases are introduced                 by Viruses.    Destroy  diseased plants. Throw away in the trash. Do not  compostsince  most  backyard gardeners do not compost in big enough  piles  inwhich  the  temperature  is  high enough  to  kill  the  fungi.   Avoidspreading  the  disease by cleaning your tools with alcohol  in-betweencuttings..   Do not use chemical fungicides. They only will cause  moreproblems both to your health and the soils health1. Use Compost tea. Some Diseases are introduced                 by Weeds.  Use  disease free seedlings and plants. Many diseases are  carriedfrom  one  plant  to  another  by humans, insects,  animals,  etc..  Beespecially  careful when bring potted plants with soil into  the  home.Certain weeds are hosts to pests which carry the disease from one plantto  another.,  therefore weed control of some type is important.  Weedscan also provide homes for many beneficial  so choose carefully.  Some Diseases are spread by Insects.  Many  diseases  are carried around by insects  such  as  the  ant.Control the insect populations in your areas. Learn what insects spreadwhat disease.    Improper Varieties Planted.  Proper placement of variety is important. Choose a location  whichgets  as much light as needed by the plant for proper growth. Make surethe  plant(s)  will  grow  normally in your area.  Choose  the  correctvariety for your area. Heirloom varieties are stronger and more  suitedfor  organic gardening. Write to Abundant Life Foundation or  Seeds  ofChange.  See Resources Directory for their address. Use Trap  crops  inaddition  to various types of traps which attracts the pests away  fromthe garden.  Improper Planting Time.     Observe  the  correct planting dates on vegetables, etc  for  bestresults. Planting during the wrong time of year also exposes plants  toinsects  that  would not normally effect your plants if they  had  beenplanted  at  the  right  time. Also temp and amount  of  day  light  isimportant.    Improper Watering  Techniques.    Avoid  overhead  watering. Use a soaker hose or  a  drip  system  when ever possible. How Important is it to Identify the Disease?    Diseases in different plants may have the same name but will  showdifferent  symptoms  thus  making Identifying  very  difficult  if  notimpossible.    While  I encourage you to try and Identify  the  diseasethat  is  attacking  your plant(s), you must remember  that  the  basictreatment(s) remains the same regardless of the disease. This book  wasnot  designed  to help you to identify the pest or disease.  There  aremany books out there that are good for that purpose.        The Invisible Gardener says:          It doesn't take magic to          control diseases naturally!_______________________________     1...Chemical Fungicides destroy the bacteria & " Goods Guys"  in  thesoil, and can cause health problems in humans and animals.

I would be interested intesting it for you and seeing for myself....concerning the whitefly problem.There are many organic soultions to this problem..my feelings is to deal with the cause and that the whitefly is only theeffects.Some of the causes is1..over use of chemicals both fertilizers and pesticides..causes inbalance in nature....2...over use of high nitrogen fertilizers..high nitrogen causes stressand rapid tender growth..3...city water kills bacteria in soil...dead soil causes imbalanceamongst bacteria found in soil.what is the answer?1...go organic!bring the soil back to life and nature will be able to control itherself..but that takes time which most people don't have...2...introduct natural whitefly predators such as Encarsia formosa(Iknow its for green houses but it does work outside too), a strongerpredator is Eretmocerus nr. californicus a parasitic wasp..veryeffective! There are more see my web site under Beneficials I haveknown.3...here are some organic tools you can use to kill them off with...    a....Dr bronners peppermint soap will kill them dead! Experimentwith the strength but 10 tablespoons per gallon should do it.. to thisI would add a liquid pyrethrin/rotenone at 2 oz per gallon(avoid ifchemically sensitive since its is strong) and finally I would add adash of Ultra Fine Oil( say 2 oz per gallon). Avoid use during heat ofday, best at night.    b...you must control the ants since they herd aphids which producenectar which the whiteflys love! see my web site entitled Dances withAnts.    c... there are many other things you can do , (see web site ), hopethis helps.Yoursandrew lopez Last Update: 09/15/96 Web Author: Andrew Lopez Copyright �1997 by The Invisible Gardener - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WT03-B17-208IA072-000462-B033-330http://www.invisiblegardener.com:80/th14002.htm 207.158.219.161 19970121020758 text/html 5284HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 02:07:58 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 07:49:54 GMTETag: "c2be7b-13b2-32dddda2"Content-Length: 5042Accept-Ranges: bytes Soil Admendments Soil Admendments      There  are  many forms of organic matter. Untreated sawdust,  agedhorse  manure,  and aged wood are common amendments and  can  be  foundanywhere. Aged wood soil conditioner, cocoa bean, mushroom compost, ricehulls  or apple pumice are usually available regionally. Organic  wastefrom your kitchen can be used to compost your soil as well as additionsof rock dust.     Other  amendments are: leaf mold, pine bark and bark chips, straw,sand,  coffee grounds, grass clippings, shredded cardboard, bat  guano,eggshells,  grapefruit skins, potato skins, and wood chips  and  ashes.Organic  matter  should be added to your soil before you  start  a  newlawn.  You should do this when the weather is fairly settled, so the groundwill  be  prime  for  planting and the new grass will  have  only  mildcompetition from weeds. The Best Organic matter to add is in  the  formof Compost. See chapter on compost. Organic Fertilizers     Soil,  in  order  to  be  alive, must have  high  organic  matter,drainage  and  good structure. Natural fertilizers  add  to  the  soil,improving its fertility, maintaining and contributing to the improvementof  these necessary elements. Organic matter and rock powders form  thebasis  of  organic fertilizers, and benefit the soil  as  well  as  theplant.  As a rule, chemical fertilizers are not a complete plant  food.Organic material contains nutrients which provide the microorganisms inthe soil with the materials they need to be active.     Organic  Fertilizer mixes usually contain composted animal manure,plant  residues,  seaweed and fish products, and minerals  (bone  andblood   meal,  cottonseed  meal,  granite  dust,  phosphate  rock   andgreensand).  Organic  Fertilizers should be used  in  combination  withcompost in order to develop rich, humousy soil.     Compost: Composting is practiced today just as it was hundreds  orthousands of years ago. The recirculation of dead matter into life  isa part of nature's program of soil rejuvenation.     A  gardener's compost heap is a process that is going on eternallyin  nature.  When we cut the grass and remove it we are cutting off thecycle.  Therefore compost, when added back to the lawn,  re-establishesthe  cycle and returns nutrients and bacteria to the soil. The gardenertakes a tip from nature and uses this simple method to build the soil'sfertility.          "Compost is the Finest Natural Fertilizer there is"     Horse Manure     Among the manure of other farm animals, horse manure is one of themost  valuable. It is richer in nitrogen than either cow or hog manure,and  ferments much more quickly, therefore being referred  to  as  "hotmanure".     Manure  provides organic matter and trace minerals  to  the  soil.Your  lawn  will  benefit by having a thin layer of aged  (at  least  6months old) horse manure spread over it (using a manure spreader),  andthen  watered  well.  This  should be  done  twice  per  year  or  evenseasonally if you can do it.     This  practice  will  also benefit the microbes  as  well  as  thebeneficial insects. But the best top dressings are made from well  madecompost  because it provides a more complete and varied food source  aswell as varied bacterial sources. Run through shredder for best results.

Since  I started The LIST ( The Living Institute of SurvivalTechnology) way back in 1972, I've been producing newsletters as a way to provide people with information . It was through the LIST that I started The Invisible Gardener and eventually The Invisible Gardeners of America. Now  with the help of the Internetand its capability of worldwide distribution of information, more people then ever willbe able to get at this information! Another exiciting thing is that the cost is a lot less! We will still be producing our paper edition twice a year along with a special edition once each year.  Anyone who can access the Internet will find a new Newsletter everymonth. This web site will be changing every week and all  IGA members will have freeaccess to these newsletters, as well as to the IGA only section. Actually there are twonewsletters,  An IGA only edition and a Free To The Public newsletter. In this web site there will be a IGA only section. A password will be required to get in and get at either the web page to view it or to download the information. We will be putting online the latest chapters in my new book "Natural Pest  Control". They will be in Acrobat formatwhich means that you must have Acrobat reader to be able to view it. These will beavailable free to IGA members, and will probably sell for $1or $2 per chapter. TheAcrobat version of the newsletter will be different from the ones you get to view online due to obvious restrictions using the web site. However as I get better at this , I hopethat will change.

For us southerns,, winter is not much differentthen other parts of the year, only a little bit colder. Yet for ants and otherinsects, the farther south the better for them.During the winter month, ants may want to move  in with you.This is a great idea to them since theres plenty of foodand water to go around!So heres where the ant cafe comes to the rescue... The Ant Cafe      This  is  a small unit which is used to hold  the  ants'food. This is an important part of your ant control program!The  ants will go inside the ant cafe to get their food. Youcan  get an ant cafe at your local pet store. They're usually calledFinch Bird Houses. Buy 2 or more. $5 is a good price. Buy  8oz  plastic cups to go inside. Get screws to screw down  thelid. Go to the store and get some honey, white sugar orcorn syrup. Place the ant cafe in areas where you are seeinglots of ants. Especially in the front or back of the house.In the front porch or under the house is where you can placethese during the winter months. You may even have to place insidethe house if the ants have already moved in.Cover with  rocks if placing outside near the house forbest results.  This  unit  is the central core of your ant controlprogram and you must learn how to make it work! That's why wecall  it dances with ants; it's  a two way street.    While ants learn quickly, people do not. So  don't  bediscouraged if  it  takes you and the ants  some  time  tounderstand what you want from each other..Don't use any poison at this point.  Allow the ants to use itfreely  as a food source. Watch and see if they are enteringand actually taking away the food.      During  this time you should be using  Dr.  BronnersPeppermint soap or some other nature soap as per chapter one"Dances with Ants", inside the house and along any paths theants are using.  Do not spray the ant cafes!      Ants  like a mixture that has a lot of water in  it  aswell.  Since water is an important part of their diet.  Iuse 1/2 water and enough sugar whether it is honey or whitesugar or whatever, and I make sure that I add enough to thickenthe water just a little.  Ants really do love honey and sugarso give them that first!The results:     The results you'll get from using the ant cafe will  bethat  allmost right away you will notice less ants  indoors!Soon  they will only be a few scouts looking around but  themajority of the ants wll be staying outside.

You must be given enough time to stop your urge to use chemicals(rather toswitch from chemicals to organics) and the soil needs time to regain theinvisible populations needed for soil be alive!    2...Maintain a healthy environment   The health of the soil is your own solution to controlling any type of pest in yourgarden especially snails!   Apply rock dust and other sources of mineral yearly toincrease energy levels of the soil Remove eggs when you encounter them.Apply earthworms as needed. Mulch regulary. Control water. Encourage predatorssuch as birds lizards, etc..     3...Avoid chemicals at all cost!    Learning to grow without using chemicals is not as scary as it seems nor is it impossible.Instead of saying avoid chemicals at all cost, I should just say do not use any chemicals thatcan harm you and your environment. Be very careful what you decide to you. Do you really haveto use it, isn't there an organic safe way to do it?   4...Plant the proper planting for the season.      Planting the wrong type of vegetables in your garden will encourage snail activity. The same goes for other types of flowers that snails find good to eat. Knowing that snailsare brone to grow during the early spring, it would not be wise to plant anything that was notprotected that you did not mind the snails eating. Agood suggestion would be to flush theearth of snails in your area. Flushing The EarthThis technique is called that because you flush out the snails from any perticular area andremove them. This will severely rteduce the snails population almostimmediatly. Should be done several times before planting.You start off by watering the area you want flushed. Water slowly to allow earth to get soakedWater several times per day for about 1 week. Each Day go outside at night and collectas many snails as you can find. Try to keep a count as this information will come in handyin determining how many snails your property has and wether its growing or dieing back.A certain level of snails is preferred while notcompletly eliminate them.See also Natural Snail Control Dept Last Update: 12/25/96 Web Author: Andrew Lopez Copyright �1997 by The Invisible Gardener - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WT03-B17-217IA072-000464-B037-280http://www.invisiblegardener.com:80/th23002.htm 207.158.219.161 19970121022146 text/html 2963HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 02:21:42 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 08:10:22 GMTETag: "c8ac84-aa2-32dde26e"Content-Length: 2722Accept-Ranges: bytes Scary Spders FAQ Scary Spders FAQ rmgaubat@artsci.wustl.eduAt 11:05 PM 9/9/96 +0000, you wrote:>Please help.

The  wheel  of  life just keeps on turning. From Death  comes  newLife.  The art of making compost is really a science, nature's  science.As  a  healing ointment for the soil, Compost is the result of  nature'sdedication  to  balance. Through watching and learning  about  the  waynature makes compost, we can begin to understand our very own lives andwhy things affect us the way they do. From Sir Howard to today, the artof  composting has taken great steps towards a better understanding  ofthe real process that takes place inside a compost pile. Purpose of Composting     There  are  two  major  reasons for making  compost..To  decomposematerials  down  to  a more workable and acceptable  form.  To  combinematerials in a favorable manner so as to increase nutritional levels aswell as increase beneficial bacteria activity, which when added to  thesoil will increase soil structure. How Composting works     Bacterial  action  in  a  compost pile is  the  basis  for  propercomposting.  It breaks down the various organic matter,  converting  itinto  compost while giving off heat and steam in the process.  It  alsomakes available trace minerals to the plants.  Always provide plenty  ofoxygen (by stirring pile, aerate it) and plenty of natural nitrogen andtrace minerals. Water is very important; too much water will drown it andnot  enough will kill off the bacteria. There are many different  typesof  bacteria present in a compost heap depending on time elapsedfrom  the start  of the pile. Different types of bacterial composition will occurthroughout  the composting process. The time of year also  determinesthe rate at which the composting process occurs.

If the bird died then everyone  wouldleave  since  they know something was wrong.  The same is currently happening  tous.  The disadvantages of chemicals are well documented with the resultbeing  the depletion of top soil1and the extinction of many species  oflife; to the mutation of pests into greater pests, and the weakening ofall  living  beings  (environmental toxins  cause  eventual  death  andextinction).  The depletion of the ozone layer is but  one  example  ofthis.   This  is  our BIRD, the earth is our cage.   We must  heed  thewarnings!  Instead what we are doing is replacing the bird!  This isnot the answer.   The  increasing use of synthetic chemicals in our daily  lives  iscausing  an  increasing  imbalance in Nature. When  nature  is  out  ofbalance it causes stress which in turn causes disorder and chaos.  It isduring  this period that diseases and pests will strike. The plant  andinsect kingdoms are but mirrors of our world.  More like a reflection,we  see  the results of our actions within the insect and plant worlds.How  long can we ignore the chaos? It is for these reasons that naturalnon-chemical lifestyles are very important in developing a sustainableenvironment. This has created a demand for the knowledge of  how  it  isdone.   The  science  of  organics is the understanding  of  the  delicatebalancing  act  which Mother Nature does every day.  It is understandingthis  balance that makes organics work. Organics have been used in  pestcontrol and farming  since  prehistoric times.  Chemicals   aresynthetic, temporary and unstable. Organics are natural, permanent  andstable.  Which  is  the  Fad?  But although  organic  sprays  and  dustscontinue  to  play  a crucial role, biological controls  are  of  equalimportance.  By attaining a thorough understanding of the relationshipsbetween  plants, soil, animals, insects and humankind, we can begin  tounderstand the deeper relationship we all have with each other. This isthe  way  the ancient farmers did it: by relying on nature's methods  ofmaintaining balance. Seven Fundamental Rules of Organic Pest Control  Rule #1  The Higher the Energy,  The Greater the Balance;  The Lower the Stress,  The Less the Pest.      High energy soils provide greater balance which reduces stress  andquiets the pest activity.  All pest activity is linked to high  stresslevels.  The  greater the stress the less nutrition is available.  Lessnutrition  increases stress! To put it in an easier terms to understand;Energy can be of either a low or high level. When it comes to plants, they want the type of energy that can  beconverted  into sugars which they need for the various plant  functionssuch  as  assimilation and flowering. The higher energy sources provideto  the  plants a quick pick-me-up.  Higher energy food  sources  aremore easily  absorbed than lower energy sources, which  require  moreenergy  to assimilate,  leaving the plant in a minus situation, which  inturn  causes  stress  etc.  But  if the plants  are  supplied  with  anabundance of food, a greater balance is achieved between the plant  andits surrounding environment.  It is through this balance that the stressof   the  plant  is  reduced.  Reduced  stress  always  equals  reducedpests/disease.  Rule #2   Everything is Linked Together    What happens to one  affects the other.    There is a Chain that links us all  Rule #3     Healthy Soil Equals Healthy Plants.      Providing a bacterial and minerally balanced soil insures  correctnutritional  availability  to  plants.   Well-nourished  plants  developstronger immunities to insect and  disease attacks.   Pests attack plantsthat are stressed out. See rule 1.   Rule #4     Always Strive to achieve Ecological Balance in your Environment.     Avoid  doing anything that causes imbalance.  All Chemicals  causeimbalance, upset the environment and increase stress.  See rule 1.         The Invisible Gardener says:     The best way to help mother nature         is to get out of her way!  Rule #5     Use only Natural Fertilizers and Natural Pest Control Methods.      The  Rule  of  Stress  applies  to  all  living  things.  Chemicalfertilizers  and  chemical  pesticides  cause  imbalance.  Avoid   highnitrogen  fertilizers. Don't use Urea based products!  Urea  kills  thebeneficials, and stays in the soil for years. To have healthy soil  youmust  have a diversity of bacteria and minerals, which is not  possiblewhen  using  chemicals.  Chemicals kill earthworms,  destroy  bacteria,lock  up minerals in the soil, and cause illness by  weakening  thebiological systems, opening them to attack from diseases or pests.  Highnitrogen causes too-rapid plant growth and tender plants as well as beingthe main cause of  many types of fungus.  Rule #6  Insects Develop Immunities to Pesticides.  People do not.      While  it  is  easy to understand that pest develop immunities  topesticides, I find it hard to believe that people think that  they  areimmune to pesticides at all. Think about it, people.  Rule # 7       Avoid Killing whenever possible.      The  idea  that pest control means killing the pest has  developedthrough  the  high pressure tactics of chemical sales people.  To  sellmore  and  more  chemicals  is indeed their goal.  Killing  upsets  thenatural balance. Let Mother Nature do this for you. She has already setup  a system of her own that works. There are many ways to control  thebehavior of pests. Only as a last resort do you kill pests. This is nota  radically new idea. All cultures through out the world respect theirinsect brothers except the white man.  The Invisible Gardener says:                     "It's not the plants that are                       hooked on the chemicals,                     It's the people using them!" _______________________________     1...What's left is nothing but sterile and lifeless.     2...Frogs  actually eat up a great deal of insects and should  alwaysbe welcome in the garden.  Plus some of them are princes in disguise!

For more info onthese folks see their web page atHere are some of my personal experiences with rock dust. See also myrock dust page                             Rock Me Baby!     I  first  started  using rock dust very early in my  childhood.  Istarted  gardening on my grand parents farm in PR and in Cuba,  and  inCosta Rica. As a child I started using finely ground sand or dust as  away to control bugs from attacking my plants. I noticed that by dustingmy vegetables and flowers that less bugs attacked them. I was not awareat  the time that I was also feeding them (the plants not the bugs).  Ilearned  that  ocean sand was also very effective  against  bugs  so  Istarted  using a little ocean sand around the base of the plants  abouttwo  feet away so not to burn them from the salt in the sand.  I  wouldmake  a  barrier  around the area  I wanted to keep the  crawling  bugsout(it  didn't work against the flying ones unless I dusted the  plantsdirectly).  I  also  learned how to spray sea water on  plants  withouthurting or burning the plants.     Grinding rocks into a fine powder became an obsession with me.  Ittook  many years of trail and error before I finally developed  my  owngrinder  that worked! What I did what turn a fifty gallon drum into  mygrinder.  Inside  I placed a large rock  or several large  round  riverrocks which when the drum was truned would crush the other softer rocksinto a fine rock powder. I hooked the drum to a bicycle and peddled  toturn the drum. Good exersice too!     It  wasn't long before I found out that I could get rock dust  forfree  in  large quantites from my local rock quary. So it  wasn't  longbefore  I was bagging rock dust and taking it home. There are  so  manythings  that  one can do with a good rock dust that I thought  I  wouldmake a list and work from there...     1....Rock Dust controls many diseases! The high mineral levels  isthe  key. Also the high energy levels of the rock dust provides a boostto the plant or tree or evn the soil! By learning how to best apply therock  dust  ,  you  will begin to take giant steps in  the  control  offungus,  diseases  as well as many pests can be controled  by  properlyusing rock dust.     2....Rock Dust restores trees to health! The application  of  rockdust during the spring once per year will encourage the root systems oftrees  ,  lawns, roses, vegetable gardens. Apply rock dust just  beforethe rainy season to take advantage of mother natures rain.     3....Rock Dust  makes a great lawn additive. By applying rock dust4  times per year once each season if possible otherwise spring, summerand fall. Apprx 50 lbs should take care of 5,000 sg  ft.     4......Rock Dust applied to fruit trees in the spring will producelarge abundance of sweet fruit for you come summer!     5...Roses  love rock dust! Apply rock dust several timesper  year,apprx 1 cup rock dust per plant, watered in well. For best results  add1 cup rock dust to 1 gallon filtered water then water base of rose. Youcan  also  make a rock dust milk by adding 1 cup rock dust to  a  pantyhose,  tie into a ball and suspend in a gallon of water. Allow  to  sitover night. Pour into sprayer and spray leaves.     6..Vegetables love rock dust! Add rock dust to your  gardens  soilat  least once per year, seasonally would be better if you are able to.Also apply rock dust as a spray once per month.     See ya next time!

This comes  from  leaves,grass  clippings, etc. Here are some sources from the plant  kingdom:   hay,leaves,apple skins(ash), banana skins(ash), coffee grounds,  cottonseedmeal, peanut shells, pine needles, A word about Human Hair     Human hair contains nitrogen and other trace minerals. Because  ofthe  amounts of chemicals used on hair these days at the beauty  parlorthe  hair  will not properly compost. Therefore use hair  from  a  men'ssalon  instead  of  a woman's, as most men do not use these  chemicals.Hair also takes too long to compost within 60 days and therefore shouldbe used in the sheet method described later. The Animal Kingdom     Obtain any or all if you can of: Cattle, chickens, horses, sheep,llamas,  goats,  rabbits, and ducks. Best is aged at  least  4  months.Trace  minerals  also come from various sources such as:Oyster  shells,coffee  wastes, silica sand, bay crab meal, kelp meal,(hair is  a  goodsource  of  trace  mineral but should be composted well  before  using)(hoof and horn meal, bonemeal, and blood meal are all optional). Animalmanures are also rich in various trace minerals(always vary your manuresource). To Bin or not to Bin?     When  you  begin to take into consideration  what  you  haveavailable to work with, you will then have to decide whether to go the  binroute  or  the pile route.  In short if you need a lot of compost  thenthe piles are easier and faster then using bins. Bins on the other handwork  fine for a person with a small garden/home. Three bins  min.  aresuggested. They should be at least 3ft by 5ft by 4ft high and  made  ofwood. There are many books available on making compost bins. Is it Rotting or Not?       If  it doesn't smell bad and looks good and dark like rich earththen it's done! HINTS.           Heat  is  important in compost making. When making  bins  orpiles,  the  bigger  the  pile the more heat  it  will  be  capable  ofproducing.  Too small a pile, and too much heat is lost. Bacteria  loveheat  and  work best within a range of 140-180 F. Too big a  pile  willcompress  the  material  too  tightly and  make  decomposition  a  slowprocess. Also too much heat will kill off bacteria. 4 to 6 ft  tall  isthe  proper  height  for  a  compost pile. This  pile  will  shrink  ascomposting takes place. This method can also be done during the  wintertime as the pile is big enough to generate its own heat. You monitor thetemp to make sure the pile heats up enough. About Nitrogen     A proper Carbon-Nitrogen ratio is important for proper composting.Nitrogen is needed to help heat up the compost. Carbon is needed as thefuel.  Adding natural sources of Nitrogen (in the form of alfalfa meal,manure  or  any organically nitrogen rich material) will  increase  itsenergy  level, allowing for great activity of  the  bacteria  present.Moisture  is  important in the composting process, but it must  not  besoggy.  I would not concern myself with this ratio; just work with  whatyou  have, keeping in mind the balance required to make the compost pilework  right. The ratio will come out just right if you apply  a  littlebit from each kingdom as mentioned above.

The  bottom  layer  is shredded manure, the next layer  is  of  plantwaste shredded.     The next layer is of rock dust, the next layer is of bloodmeal andbonemeal mixed, optional, kitchen food wastes ok here instead. The nextlayer is of old shredded manure such as horse. The next layer is of topsoil, the next layer is of kelp meal or seaweed meal, the next layer isof  rock dust. Then add  either rabbit,or goat (shredded) or earthwormcastings.  Then  add either grass clippings, leaves or both  mixed  andshredded,  then add a layer either of old horse or old sheep or old cowmanure, then add a layer of dia-earth (for fly control); Top it off witha  4  in  layer of top soil. In between each layer you should  add  thefollowing:  mix  together  equal parts:  Cottonseedmeal,  Alfalfa  mealKelpmeal,  Epsom  Salts,  Rock  dust or Greensand  or  Rock  Phosphate,Compost.     The  idea  is to lightly sprinkle a thin layer of this formula  inbetween  each  layer, while also spraying (lightly)  a  liquid  seaweedmixture  such  as a Superseaweed� and Nitron� and Shure Crop  mixture(1 cup  each  added  to  1  gallon water, 20 drops  of  superseaweed).  Usefiltered water. Your compost bin should have a lid and be made of  woodto allow it to breathe. Day 2:     Allow to sit Day 3:     Check the temp. Write this down in your log book Day 4:     Turn contents of bin #1 into bin #2 (you should have three bins forthis purpose), turning over well and adding a sprinkling of the formulaas  you go and also spraying with the liquid seaweed. Start the processover again in bin #1. Day 5:     Check the temp in both bins , note this in your compost log.  Turnover bin #2, making sure everything is turned over well while adding  athin sprinkling of the formula. Check to make sure neither bin is toowet  or too dry. Add water as needed by spraying (this water is the sameliquid seaweed I've been talking about). Day 6:     Allow both bins to sit. Day 7: This is your first week! Isn't compost making fun!!!       Today  you  turn over both compost bins, checking  for  moisture  and heat. Day 8:     Then  the  next day dump the contents of bin #2 into bin #3,  turnbin #1 into bin #2 and start all over again with bin #1. Day 9:       Allow everyone to sit and rest. Day 10:     Turn  over bin #3 (sprinkle with formula mixture).  Turn  over  bin#2 (sprinkle with formula mixture).   Check all bins for water, temp. Day 11:     Allow everyone to rest today, checking for too much water etc. Day 12     Check  on  bin #3, how does the compost look? Are there any  partswhich don't look decomposed? Remove that and place in bin #1. Turn overbin #3 ,water as needed with liquid seaweed and add a sprinkling of theformula.  Check bin#2 , how are we doing here? Turn over  and  sprinkleformula and add water (liquid seaweed) as needed. Day 13:     Two more days to go... Allow all bins to sit and rest today Day 14:     Well here it is, the day you've been working for. Check bin #3  andtadum!!! Rich compost. Never add raw waste into bins #2, #3. These binsare  for finishing the composting process. Bin #1 is where you may alsoadd  kitchen waste such as rice leftovers, salad leftovers, etc.  Neveradd  meat or cooking oils as this will stop the composting process  andyou  may  even have to dispose of the compost. You may add egg  shells,coffee grinds, to the first bin only. Rock Dust is excellent for helpingthe composting process.

Raised Beds are easy to make and you can recycle (re-use)  variousmaterials   in  making  the beds. You can use rocks,  wood  (untreated,unpainted of course), tree logs, bricks.  You can use bottles  to  makethe  sides of your raised beds. Stick upside  down in ground.  You  canuse  clay on the inside to mold and hold them together or you  can  usesand  and pack it in or use rope to tie them together. The idea  has  alot  of potential for re-using glass around the home. Untreated Redwoodmakes good wood for raised beds. A good size for a raised bed is 10  ftlong  by 5 ft wide by 12 inches tall by 2 in thick.  This size  is  bigenough  to feed a family of 4.  Pine, fir and almost any kind of strongwood  is all right as long as it is untreated. Never use Rail Road tiesthat  have  been treated. This is very bad for your health as  well  asbeing bad for the garden (it kills the soil).

Making good compostis  a  special  art that we all must learn if we are to  become  MasterOrganic Gardeners. GREEN  COMPOSTING     30%  of  our landfill materials come from this area of our wastes.Grass  clippings, leaves, etc. make great additions to  our  compostingsystem. A shredder will help to speed up the composting process. KITCHEN COMPOSTING     It  pays  to  be able to save all of your kitchen wastes. A  smallcontainer  would  be  useful  to have  in the  kitchen  area  for  thispurpose.  Make sure it has a lid. We compost all of our kitchen  wastesand  recycled paper wastes as well as the wood from the matches we use,etc.,  any thing that will compost  is saved. Learning to make  compostis  a great way to take something that is being thrown away and turn itinto  food  for the soil,  for the plants, and  food for us..  This  isrecycling  at  its best! Make sure that you empty the  container  everyday. I suggest that you can compost the kitchen wastes by layering intoyour  compost.  You can also bury the kitchen wastes into  your  gardenallowing the worms a meal. Adding some rock dust to kitchen waste  willhelp reduce smells and flys,and will also increase microbial activity.

A soaker hose will work very wellhere.  The soaker hose can be buried about 2 to 4 inches from  the  topand  can  be  moved  as needed. Remember where the  hose  is  to  avoiddamaging when planting. A battery timer will help to control the  waterand  is easy to operate. Place a garden filter between the hose and thetimer. Your garden will love this extra touch. Buy Earthworms for your gardenEarthworms will love your raised bed. Give them a head start by  buyingafrican red wigglers which is the best kind for this use. Planting the Vegetables     Start by making a list of the favorite vegetables that you like toeat.  If you haven't grown a garden before, I suggest that you  take  agardening class to help you out. Consider joining a garden club as theyare  a  great  source of not only help but seeds, resources  etc..  Thevarieties that you choose to grow will be important and you must  learnwhich  will  grow  in your area. I also suggest that you  get  heirloomseeds  instead  of  the commercial ones. Try Seeds of Change,  AbundantLife, Native Seeds, Herlooom Garden Seeds, Native American Seed, NativeSeeds/Search, Bountiful Gardens, Peace Seeds, Plant Finders of America,Ronniger's  Organic  Seed  Potatoes,  Seed  Savers  Exchange,  SouthernExposure  Seed Exchange, For more resources try Acres USA. Mixing Flowers and Herbs     It  is  a  good  idea to plant flowers and herbs along  with  yourvegetables for best insect protection. Try 50% flowers and herbs  alongwith your vegetable garden.

I  have tried everything including  what's  in  yourbook. Now please help me.YoursLostDear  Lost,Whenever Ants are behaving like there's no tomorrow, you  canbe sure there's a reason for it! You must realize that ants reactto  everything  that  happens to their environment.  The  morechemicals are  being used  in  our  environment,  thegreater the reaction from the ants. Look around you,see  if  you  can  find a local source  of  chemicals.  Fromchemical  fertilizers  to chemical herbicides,  etc..  Removethem  and  you  will begin to get  greater control  over  theants!Take slow  steps  to change. This is the  best  way.  Don'texpect  too much too fast. Learn to use the natural soaps  Imention in my book. Using these natural soaps will go a longway toward controlling ants. Ants do not like soap and they willbehave if they know you will use it against them!Use  the  soap inside. Clean up after yourself! Don't  leavefood around for them or they'll come and get it!Attend to the health of the soil first! Then everything elsewill fall into place! Please  feel free to send me your questions and I will  postthem up with an answer. Dear Andy,  I  followed the steps in your book and I still have ants! What  am  Idoing  wrong? It has been several weeks now. Please tell me what  I  amdoing  wrong and what I should do to correct it? I am recently  marriedand do not wish to use any chemicals around my wife and animals.  New Husband In need,  Dear Husband in need,  It  is understandable that you are in a hurry to get some relief fromthe  ant  problem.  It  is important that you follow  the  instructionsactually as written. In order to work, these steps must be  givenenough  time  for  the process to begin to take hold.  Two  things  arehappening, 1... you are learning, and 2... so are the ants!  As  you  learnto  respond to the ants, you will also be conditioning the ants.  Learnto  use  the soaps as your first line of defense. There are many naturalsoaps  out  there!  I personally like Dr. Bronners Peppermint  soap  forthis purpose.  Follow the instructions as per strength to mix with waterin  quart  sprayer. Another thing is, in order for you to control the  ants,the  ant cafe must work. In other words, the ant cafe must be activelybeing  used by theants! Feed them as per instructions. Feed  them  onlysugared water at first then boric acid once they are active in the  antcafes. See Boric acid Faq for help in using .   Dear Andy,  How long will I have to feed them? I can't feed them for the rest ofmy life, can I? Rest of life...  Dear Rest of Life.  Doing  something  for the rest of one's life does sound  like  a  longtime  and  it may well be, but moment to moment, it is not.  Whatyou  do now effects you now. The longer you do it, the longer it  willcontinue to affect you. So as for how long will you have to `feed'  theants? Well you will do it for as you as you have to and for as long  asit works and for as long as it makes you happy to do so.  I  find that where I live that conditions are such that I have greatly reducedant  problems simply by feeding the ants in the ant cafes and usingthe  peppermint inside. Dear Andy,My question is, if I don't use any boric  acid,and  just  feed them , won't their colony get bigger and won't  it  getworse? Hmmm?Dear Hmmm?,There  will  come a point when there will just be too  many  ants  onyour  property for you to live happily with.  It's that simple. You  feedthe  ants and condition them to stay out of the house and certain otherplaces you don't want them to get into, in exchange  for  which  youfeed  them! But once the ants think that you are their slave  andthey  want more you will have to get their attention! You already  havetheir attention indoors by using the peppermint soap, now you get theirattention outside by introducing boric acid to their food. I know  it'smean  and cruel but it's the best way to go instead of using chemicals  thatslowly torture them to death. See how to use boric acid.But  concerning  your  question about the ants getting  too  big  andgoing  after  us well mother nature will not allow any one creature  torule. Watch and see. Send  in  your questions and I will post and answer it for others  toenjoy. Ant Sprays FAQDear Andy,How  much soap is enough to add to 1 quart of water? I addedthe amount in the book to kill the roaches but found that  Ihad to make it stonger to make it work.  I thought perhaps  Iwas making it too stong? SoapyDear Soapy,The  strength of the soap will vary from state to state andfrom  species to species of ants. Generally I  would  try  1tablespoon   of  any  concentrated  soap  like  Dr   Bronnerspeppermint soap to a quart water.  Spray on ants and  see  ifit  is  stong  enough  to  kill them.  If  not, add  anothertablespoon.  Do this until you have reached a point where theants die on contact with the soap-water mixture. Dear Andy,I  am finding it hard to find Dr. Bronners peppermint soaparound where I live. Can I use something else? Hard to FindDear Hard to find,Any Natural  soap  will  do.  Just remember  that  peppermintworks especially  well for this purpose but citrus or  herbalsoaps  work  also.  Just read the label and avoid  anythingwith additives, etc. in it!

They  havebeen  called by many names, " The Rats  of the insect world"  for  one.Cockroaches belong to the order Blattoidea (family Blattidae), and  canlive  up to a year. The Female lays several egg cases containing 30-50 eggsea.  during  her life time. Some varieties carry their egg  cases  withthem  and  place  them  for hatching later. Cockroaches  utilize  theirantennae to pick up chemical signals from the air. This helps  them  inkeeping  away from any synthetic chemical used against them. What  thismeans  is  that cockroaches will detect pesticides and avoid the  area.They  also  sample food stuffs before eating to detect pesticides  usedagainst  them.  This is why using chemicals against them is  fruitless.Cockroaches  have  memories as good as the ants'. They rememberwhere  your food  stuff  is at and how to get at it. They also rememberwhere  they hide  that last morsel.  Like the ant, they  have developedimmunity to many pesticides. They are very active at night.     Since  the days of cavemen, roaches have shared their home  with  humans.Cockroaches will live in almost any environment. They can be  found  onboard  ship, near food areas, bathrooms. Their eggs are good travelers,hitchhiking  on board containers en route. Air travel doesn't  botherthem.  They will thrive any where the moisture, temperature and  amountof food available falls within tolerable boundaries.     Like  the  ant, a cockroach is capable of traveling many miles  inone  day.  They can move  through the cracks in walls. Where  they  go,their  eggs follow. A cockroach can live without food for three  monthsand without water for over thirty days. Their egg cases can survive foryears under the right conditions.     There are over 4,000 species of cockroaches known; 57 are found inthe  United  States. Cockroaches have existed since  the  Paleozoic Erawhich  is  about 400 million years ago. Only 6 species in the  USA  areconsidered bad household pests.

The subterranean is the one that causes 95%of  the  damage. Subterraneans require contact with a moist  soil.  Thislimits their attack on wet and dry woods to areas within reach of the soil. Theymake  tunnel-like tubes to connect the soil and wood  together.  Thesetunnels are meant to protect them when they travel  and  are  usuallyfound freestanding in the crawl space below your home.     Drywood termites don't require the moisture that subterraneans do.They can attack the structure far away from the soil. They create smallgalleries with small entrances plugged with partially chewed wood and acement  like  secretion. Drywood termites leave piles of  sawdust  likepellets. Termite Prevention     The   conditions  that  invite  wood  damaging  termites  can   bediscovered  and  corrected long before the problem gets  out  of  hand.Therefore  it  is  important for the home owner  to  learn  the  propermeasures that can be taken to prevent termites from entering your home.

Use onlynatural soaps; avoid using any of the chemical varieties such asliquid dishwasher soap, dove, ivory, etc.  They are very bad for yoursoil's ecosystem.         You should hand pull weeds when ever possible.  A goodcombination is, first spray with the soap and water mixture, waita day then pull them out. The weeds will come out very easliy.

Reduce  waterrunoff. Urban forestry helps clean up cities and raise the quality  oflife,   promoting   interaction  between  urban  dwellers   and   theirenvironment. Trees also reduce heat and glare. Why Feed Them Chemicals ?     The  answer is simple, trees cannot use chemicals in their system!Trees  must be fed naturally and in accord with how the natural  systemworks. Remember trees have been around for a long time. Proper Tree Care     How  to  feed  them,  then? Chemical fertilizers damage  the  soil'secosystem,  cause stress and lack the essential bacteria and  minerals.Trees  require  certain conditions for proper growth and  good  health.Proper  site selection is very important. It is important to understandwhat these conditions are.  Proper tree selection for the environment itwill  be in is also important.  Before planting, amend the soil with goodrich  compost  and  lots  of humus.  Provide regular  watering.  Provideregular composting. Mulch as Needed     Most  trees  will mulch themselves, so don't rake away  their  leafdroppings.  Do not use any chemical fertilizer or pesticides.   Do  nottop  trees!  Go  Native when ever possible.  Hire only skilled  workers.Remember, it cost less to keep a healthy tree then to replace it.  Savea  tree  whenever possible. Don't cut it down; plan around and  includethe tree in your planning! Trees Need Water     Make sure that you provide adequate watering on a regular basis. Adrip  system or soaker will help. Filter the water. Use tree vents  fordeep  watering  if possible. Use a garden filter for this.  The  properselection of trees is important for this purpose. Trees Love Compost     Compost  is  one of the few things you can feed trees with.  Localcompost  rich with trace minerals, composted animal manure and lots  ofhumus are best.  Feed yearly if possible.Never feed trees High Nitrogen.High nitrogen causes stress which is the main cause for pest or diseaseattack. Trees get their nitrogen from the air, from the compost andfrom the natural bacteria found in the soil.

Spray with  a  liquidseaweed concentrate such as Superseaweed or spray Nitron A-35 or  Agri-Gro's  Premier Plant Food or Gardeners Supply Roots Plus. Apply  it  asoften as needed. Don't Want to Make Your Own Compost?     Look around your city.  Many cities are making compost these days.Ask  them what it made from. Avoid ones with sewer sludge unless it  isclean  of heavy metals, etc.. See if you can spot any places that  sellcompost. Ask other gardeners for a source. Go out into the country sideand  look around there. Always ask them what they are doing with it andhow  they  are   making it. Ask them if they are ex-posing  it  to  anychemicals  etc. Never assume that anything is as they say  it  is.  Askabout  how they make it and what goes into it, how long have they  beenmaking it and so on. These are important questions which you should  beasking.  Now  a days there are more and more people making and  sellingcompost  so  it  should not be hard to find.  Both Nitron  Company  andArbico Company sell Compost thru the mail.                     The Invisible Gardener Says:   "Avoid Buying Compost made with sewer sludge since it may contain    heavy metals which can pollute ourselves and our environment."     Sewer  sludge  can be processed correctly with the end  result  ofgood  clean  safe compost2. However studies around the world have shownthat  this  is  not  the  case for most of the worlds  sewer  treatmentplants. Especially in the USA. This is one area that we must look  intovery closely if we are to solve this problem. Thru the use of bacteria,we can make sewer sludge a safe organic alternative to fertilizers. Thelaws are changing rapidly every year.     We  must  keep close watch over this or it will be a problem  thatwill  not  be  easily  resolved.  Do not  believe  it  when  they  (themanufacturer) say the levels of toxins are below EPA standards.  Insistthat they lower the standards to zero levels. Remember every little bitof toxin adds up to a lot! Check with the source before you buy it!  Here are some suggestions of possible sources ofcomposting materials or compost all ready made:     Talk with your local restaurant stores especially the natural food     ones as their vegetables, etc. are organic.Use in your compost.     Locate  seafood  locations where they either cook them,  as  in  a       restaurant,  or where they catch them as in a dock.   These  can       be dried for your compost use.     I also  suggest  that you collect clam shells etc. as  these  when       dried  and  crushed make an ex-cellent addition   to  a  compost       pile.     Look  for any sources of coffee such as either coffee hulls and or       coffee grinds,similarly, locate sources of tea, either tea  bags       or leaf.     Lumber  yards may also be a good source of material provided  that       you only use untreated wood products.     Locate chicken farms, ask for their feathers, and/or egg shells as       well  as any droppings. Ask them what they are spraying  if  any       thing.     Locate  horse  or cattle farms ask if they spray their animals  or       the manure.     Look  for an organic mushroom farm. Make sure they are organic(use       steam instead of chemicals).     Look for old alfalfa bales.     Grass  clippings  make an excellent source of  nitrogen  for  your       compost pile, just make sure its organic (unsprayed).  For  more       information on compost see compost chapter._______________________________     1Chemical fertilizers, especially those with a high nitrogen  basesuch as Urea, do considerable damage to the soil eventually killing offall  beneficial  bacteria  which then leads  to  you  guessed  it..sickplants!     2Using bacteria, toxins can be removed from the soil. This is  thefuture  of composting plants and sewer plants. Until then ask questionsconcerning your local sewer sludge and what it is being used for. Sewersludge  and compost don't go well together. Unless the sewer sludge  isprocessed using bacteria, it will contain heavy metals and other toxinsthat  will  end up in your environment; that will end up in your  food;that will end up inside of you!

HOT WATER HOT WATERDid you know that you can use hot water to control insects and diseases?More on this will be coming here next issue.Mean while Heres what some has been doing about hot water. WHITEFLY IN HOT WATER SINCE 1991 horticulturist Jim Nichols in Thousand Oaks, Californiain the United States has found that he can control whitefly withhot water. Nichols has filed a patent application for a line ofequipment that uses a brief exposure to extreme heat and hot waterfor the control of whitefly, aphids, mealybug, scale and miteinfestations. Nichols has found a brief hot water treatment of 150-160F. from oneto three seconds controls all stages of the whitefly life cycle.For the five years that Nichols has conducted trials on histechnique, it has been completely effective on whitefly and a broadspectrum of small bodied "infestation" insects without any damageto the treated plants. Nichols is seeking interest and cooperation from the U.S.Department of Agriculture officials and from representatives of theagriculture industry for the most effective ways to expediteequipment development.

Theincreased  bacteria stimulates the composting process.  Rock dust  alsohelps  heat up the compost pile. Add a thin layer of rock dust  to  thecompost  pile,  alternating between layers of grass clippings,  manure,kitchen  wastes,  etc., Water as needed. As rock dust  has a high PHlevel,  use small amounts and add something acidic like leaves or  pineneedles. Never add chemicals to the compost. To lower PH level if it istoo  high,  add one quart vinegar with five gallons water and  sprinkleover pile once per week.See chapter on compost for more information. Pest Control     Rock  dust  is  also very effective in controlling pests  such  assnails,  because of its high silica content (67%). Dust  lightly  aroundthe garden, allow to sit for 24 hours, then  water  well. On Trees     Trees  also  love rock dust. Always use small amounts  as  the  PHlevel  can irritate high acid based trees. A large tree should be givenfour  coffee  cans full of rock dust spread evenly beneath its  canopy,starting two feet from the trunk to ten feet past the furthest reach ofits  branches. Sprinkle evenly then spray down with hose. Use a  gardenfilter to filter out the chlorine from the water. In The Garden     Dust  around  the  vegetable plants, allow to sit overnight,  thenspray down with filtered water. Mix into a liquid form and add seaweed.Spray this on the plants leaves, this increases the energy level of theplants,  assisting  them  in  fighting off  pests.  Use  peat  moss  orcomposted  aged  wood to maintain a balanced PH level. Your  vegetableswill  have  increased  mineral and vitamin content  and  will  be  morenutritious. For the Lawn     When  used  on lawns , rock dust will increase color and encouragedeeper root systems. Using rock dust will decrease your need to add anyhigh  nitrogen  .  Rock  dust will also increase the  effectiveness  ofcompost applications. Add 50 pounds of rock dust per 1,000 square  feetof lawn. Apply twice yearly.  After dusting lawn, water well. Take carenot to breathe in the rock dust when you are dusting your garden, lawn,trees, etc.More on How to use Rock Dust Coming Up!

This is important because the  finerthe  dust  the  more  rapidly it is available to  the  plants  and  themicrobes which have to eat it. The location where it is mined is importantas this gives us a clue as to the forces that went into making it.  Highenergy  always makes high energy. Ask for a lab report. What PH is  it?Don't  use cement for construction use. Tell them what you want  to  dowith it. Don't use any rock dust that has any type of chemical added toit. The Test     A  good  test is to fill a clear glass half full with your  sampleand  cover  it  with 3 inches of water. Shake it up  and  allow  it  tosettle.  The  dust,  silt  and sand will settle  into  three  differentlayers,  with  the  dust  settling on  top.  This  will  give  you  thepercentage of how much of each you have. The finer the grind the easierthe  bacteria can get at it. However I have also found it  to  be  truethat  small  chunks, less than 1/4 inch, are good for the soil  as  othercreatures  will  eat it also. Another thing is that these  chunks  willbreak apart later providing additional food. Another Test     Take any magnet and place on rock dust.  If it clings to the magnetit is of the right energy polarity. Making Rock Dust Milk     Slowly  add  water  to  a  cup of rock  dust.  Stir  slowly  untildissolved.  Add  to  1  gallon water, allow to sit,  then  strain  intosprayer. This makes the food instantly available to plants sprayed. Types of Rock Dust     Rado  Rock comes from Canada straight from the glaciers.  PlantersII  comes  from the Colorado Rockies. Earth Wealth comes from  the  SanGabriel Mountains in southern California. Azomite comes from Utah. RockPhosphate is a well known rock dust, excellent when finely ground.  NewJersey Greensand is also a very nice rock dust but can be expensive  tobuy depending on where you live in the USA.

The key thing to do here is to vacuumthoroughly any rugs, send them to the cleaners if you can't do this,then have a company come and steam clean them.     You can dust with pure pyrthrium flowers. Use only 100%      pyrethrium dust. You can alternatively use a mixture of      DE and Pyrethrium. I suggest that you buy a pound of garden      grade DE and a 8oz of Pure Pyrethrium dust, blend the      two together. Handle  with care since it is a dust and you      should avoid breathing ANY kind of dust. This mixture is safe      and will not harm you or your animals as they should be dusted      also before and after you clean your rug. Pyrethrium can be purchased from ArbicoArbico site Remember this is only temporary, if you are a IGA member,      you should      1....read   'About  Fleas ' in my book or online.      2....read  ' Flea Chapter' in my book "Natural Pest Control" which you      recieved free when joining.      3......See  Step 1 Natural Flea control.

This species  of ant is very differentthen it's American cousin. IFAs are  much more  aggressive withthe ability to sting many times with a  toxic  venom. These  littleguys will not take a no for an answer and will attack you  ifyou  are in their way or if you have stepped on their mounds.The IFA  also build  bigger, more powerful colonies, with an extensiveunderground  system  of tunnels  that can reach 50-100 feet inany direction from their main  mounds, which  have  been  knownto be as tall as three feet!  These  guys   though natives  to Argentina, hadclaimed 27 millions acres  by  1957,  and  230million acres since 1985. In 1995 have begun to move into Californiaand Arizona. They have attacked and taken over territories normallyclaimed  by their American counter parts. When  they  first arrived they were given help in the form of the  US governments  efforts to eradicate them. The governmentfunded  wide  spread spraying  of pesticides heptachlor and mirexduring the 1950's and  1960's. Well  guess what, while the sprayingskilled off millions of the  ants,  it also  killed off any competitionallowing the remaining IFAs to  expand  at will. The sprayingswere stopped but not until it was to late and IFAs were hereto stay. They then quickly spread into eight southern states,into Oregon, and Washington, then recently into Arizona and nowinto California. Millions  of  people  are stung every year by IFAs  making  them very dangerous  to  those people that are allergic to their bite. At  least  50 people  die  each year due to allergic reactionsto IFAs bite. Many  can  be prevented with immunotherapy withwhole-body extracts of the IFAs. Since up to 60% of any urbanpopulation is bitten by IFAs, this precaution is a very important step to take. If you are one of these folks who are allergic to IFAs bite then see your doctor. IFAs  have  been  known toattack people in their homes,  gardens  and almost any place wherehumans and ants meet. This is a very different  case then livingtogether with harmless ants. To make matters worse (if they canget  worse),  these  ants no longer fight amongst themselvesfor  food  or territories, instead they have gone from a single queen per colony ( which fought  other  colonies) to multiplequeen colonies  which  have  lost  the ability  to distinguishbetween themselves and the ants of other  colonies, so they livetogether and share in the food gathering, etc.. Where a single queen  colony would contain 200,000 ants per colony,with about 50 colonies per  acre (in urban areas, as much as 20colonies would have fought over  a single  1/4 acre lot!), a multiplequeen colony would have as many  as  400 multiple  queens  colonies per acre ( or as many  as  100  multiple  queen colonies per1/4 lot!) will be living together in peaceful existence!  Withthis  type of multiple queen set up, IFAs can with stand greater cold  and are  able  to come back faster from pesticide attacksby humans, with  very few animals or other creatures being ableto withstand their onslaught. Another problem is that the red imported fire ant (IFA) and theblack imported  fire  ant  (Solenopsis richteri) are  interbreeding  creating  a stronger  hybrid which is evenmore tolerant of pesticide attacks and  more resistant  to cold(they can live farther north then before).  One  of  the fire ants  natural  enemy,  is  the South  American  Phorid  Fly,is  being considered  as a possible control alternative but iflessons  in  the  past have  been  learned. More study is neededbefore this fly is imported  into the USA.    The  methods describedwill work against the IFAs just as  well as against any othertypes of ants. Boric acid will kill them just as  surely as itwill kill off other ants. Just remember that the  strength ofthe boric acid must be strong enough to killthem but not so strong that the ants cannot take this mixtureback to their colonies and eventually  to their queens.

Soil  supplies  air,water,  nutrients,  and  physical support to plants.  Soil  also  needsorganic  matter to keep it alive. Each type of soil needs  a  differentamendment.  Sand,  clay,  and silt, in varying amounts,  determine  thetexture of the soil. Compost will help to bind soil particles and  holdwater  to the soil. Water is also important for productivity. Too  muchor  too  little  water hinders proper plant growth.  In  addition,  thepresence of earthworms aids in maintaining good soil structure.     Use only organic materials. Increase organic matter. Use manure asa  top  dressing.  Use organic fertilizers. Lawns love compost... 1.  Lawnslove rock dust. Blend the two together for best results.               "There are two ways to sterilize the soil                                by Heat                           and  Chemically"     Chemical  fertilizers kill off the beneficial  soil  bacteria,  aswell as killing off earthworms and therefore should not be used, shouldbe  avoided  at all costs!   In this environment, the lawn  and  its  bio-system  will  be  operating under stress. Stress is the most  importantfactor in pest control.     Whenever  the lawn is under stress, several things have  occurred:1:  Proper Food is not being made available to the lawn.   2: The Humuslevels have dropped below optimum.   3: Water effects stress. Too  muchor  too little water will cause stress in the lawn (chlorinated water isbad for the soil). 4: High nitrogen fertilizers kill the soil and causea great deal of stress. Avoid using Urea at all costs.Understanding The Environment     More than any other element of climate, temperature will determinewhich  type  of  lawn  will grow where. Available  sunshine  and  water(either  in the form of rain or humidity) round things out.   An  exampleof  this  is: if irrigation is unavailable, only certain desert speciesof  lawns  can be grown. It is a good idea to consult a gardening  bookwhich  has a map broken into climatic zones. This will help to simplifythe process of deciding which grasses you should consider._______________________________     1 See rock dust dept for more info. gotoRock Dust Dept Last Update: 12/25/96 Web Author: Andrew Lopez Copyright �1997 by The Invisible Gardener - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WT03-B17-277IA072-000464-B044-104http://www.invisiblegardener.com:80/th27002.htm 207.158.219.161 19970121025136 text/html 2364HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 02:51:34 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 07:39:00 GMTETag: "c2b8dc-84b-32dddb14"Content-Length: 2123Accept-Ranges: bytes Steps to Creating your own Garden Paradise Steps to Creating your own Garden Paradise      Raised Beds or not.

Now I have a lawn that needs your help!I never paid much attention to my lawn until it started to look bad and wouldnt growas well as my neighbors lawn did. So I asked what they did and I went out andbought 40 lbs of weed and feed stuff that I could find at my local nursery.Well, the stuff smelled awful! On the way home I nearly died! After reading theingridents and talking with the local dept of agri agent as well as talking tp mylocal gardern center sales person, who all told me it was perfectly save to use.So I went a head and applied it to my lawn. a few things happened right after that....1....I became ill for about two weeks. Doctor said I had a mild case of a 24 hr flue.2...My cats became ill and would not eat their food. This lasted for about 4 days.Then they were allright after that.3...My children, especially my liitle girl, developed at first a  nose drip then developedinto a flue like systoms.4...My dog also refused to eat for about a few days then she would eat ok after that.After about 2 months after I applied the weed and feed, the symptoms disappeared. No one connected it to the weed and feed application. That it until I applied the stuffagain in another two months( the directions said to apply every 4 months).The same thing happened again only worse! My illness lasted several months and I stillhave'nt fully recovered. My little girl was tested (they did a spinal tap) and was found notto have lukimia as they had sespected. They they don't know what what they main cause except they sespect it to be caused by some toxin in the environment(hint..weed and feed?and my dog has died of some type of liver illness since thge last application(my dog died within 24 hrs of my last application!).I went to a famous doctor to test us out. He descovered that we were being attacked by severaltoxins in our environment and suggested that I get your book "Natural Pest Control" thatit would help me to find natural alternatives to these chemicals. I have also told him of theweed and feed applications (only after he had asked me about what chemicals I have beenusing in my home and garden). He found that I was also using some rather deadlycombinations of home products.I have since getting your book, stop applying any type of chemical in my home and garden.With your help my garden is green and safe and my family is enjoying good health aswell!yours TrulySilvia MNew York NY Last Update: 12/29/96 Web Author: Andrew Lopez Copyright �1997 by The Invisible Gardener - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WT03-B17-288IA072-000462-B024-387http://www.invisiblegardener.com:80/th03001.htm 207.158.219.161 19970121013546 text/html 3801HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 01:35:47 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 07:41:03 GMTETag: "c2e5ff-de8-32dddb8f"Content-Length: 3560Accept-Ranges: bytes Statement of Purpose Statement of Purpose        The  Invisible Gardeners of America operates to provide itsmembers  information  on natural alternatives  to  chemicalsused  in pest control as well as information on alternativesto  chemicals  for the homeowner, farmer and  professional.IGA  operates  to  provide  information  via  The  InvisibleGardener's  advice  to  his  members,  newsletters,  videos,workshops, radio and internet web site.

Natural Gopher Control Intro....                How to Control Gophers/Moles Organically     Pocket  Gophers, or Ground Squirrels as they are sometimes called,can  be as big a problem as ants.  1.  Gophers are like little bulldozers.They  dig  a  network of tunnels  usually six to 12  inches  below  thesurface. 2.  Tunnels near the surface are for gathering food and  act  ashighways to get around; deeper ones are for sleeping, raising the youngand storing food. Well-suited to burrowing, gophers have small eyes andears  that  don't clog with dirt, and sensitive whiskers and  tails  toguide  them in the dark. Gophers have long teeth for biting off  chunksof  hard  soil or roots. They are sensitive to sound, and a variety  ofsmells,  as well as light.  3. To successfully control gophers  and  otherrodents, one needs to understand their senses of smell and hearing.  Ifyou  see  a plant being dragged under ground you know you have gophers.Gophers  eat  plant  roots  as well as bulbs.   They  will  eat  almostanything  including most vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots,  squash,lettuces,  etc. and they also love roses (the roots). They'll nibble  onthe roots of your fruit trees, roots of most flowers, and tulips. Molesare  insectivores  they eat earthworms, bugs, larvae,  grubs,  spiders,centipedes  and only occasionally nibble on greens and roots.  Most  ofthe  time,  they  do  very  little  damage  other  than  through  theirtunneling,   unearthing plants and exposing root systems. How  can  youtell a gopher from a mole? Gopher mounds have dirt pushed off to one sideof  the mound while moles have a volcano effect with the center at  theentrance  to  the tunnel (usually plugged up). Poisons do not  work  onmoles! They must be trapped and moved away.     Gophers  can do a great deal of damage, 4. but are an important  partof  the natural ecosystem. I do not recommend the use of traps as  theyare  inhumane  and very cruel. 5. It is important that you properly  feedand  care for your plants as gophers are less likely to attack  healthyplants.  By  top-dressing your lawn and property  with  year-old  horsemanure,  you  will  not only be feeding your soil, but  also  repellinggophers  naturally  as  they  do not like  manure.  You  will  also  beencouraging  natural predators as compost promotes healthyenvironments which  always attracts the variety of life needed for thereto  be a balance.    When there is balance there is co-existence._______________________________     1 And as easy to control!     2 The deeper the tunnel, the older the gopher that dug it!     3 This is the key to their control!     4  If  they wanted to do damage they would! It would be better  toget  used  to  them if possible then to try and kill them  off.  A  lotdepends  on where you live. In my garden, gophers come and go  as  theyplease. They are welcome as they do a lot of soil turning over for  me!It is not hard to train them to only be in certain areas of your gardenand to leave other areas alone. Actually, I like gophers coming throughcertain  parts of my garden during the right times for them  to  loosenthe  soil for me, eat any grubs, insects and then leave the garden  forme and my vegetables!     5  Unless you use the humane traps which don't hurt them and  theycan then be moved to another safer area.

Snails are best picked after dark2  oron  cloudy  days  when they are most active. Water well   a  few  hoursbefore picking to promote activity on their part. Throw a snail pickingparty!. Tell your kids that you will pay them per snail picked. A  goodprice is a penny per snail (100 snails equals 1 dollar). Have plenty offlashlights available. Provide gloves. Have buckets filled either withsalt  and  soapy  water, DE or salt layer, or rock  dust  layer.  Throwpicked snails into a bucket for disposal later.     Alternatively, you can crush the snails and place  them  into  theant cafe as ants love to eat snails. If using rock dust, crushed snailscan be added to compost pile. If you have chickens, feed the snails  tothem.  Pick  up every single snail you see and destroy it.  Snails  canproduce  over  300 eggs per day during laying season and the  eggs  canstay  buried in the ground for up to 11 years and emerge when the  timeis  right  for  their survival. Another method is to attract  and  trapthem. (See Snail Cafe)._______________________________     1  And  especially picking their eggs! The eggs  are  found  belowground  in clusters or under  rocks and boards. By cultivation  of  thesoil  you  can expose the eggs and simply remove them by throwing  themaway in a plastic baggy.     2 Best time is really at night since they do their work at night.

I provide you with this informationfor your amusment and private use only.>>     The Non-Toxic Medicine Cabinet       It  is  surprising how many toxins one can find in our  medicine  cabinet!   Many of our tools for healing ourselves are themselves deadly.       Doctors  use  many  synthetic substances  with  exotic  sounding  names.     Here  is  a  list of recommended natural survival tools for  your natural  medicine cabinet.      Honey     Is an important natural healing agent. It destroys bacteria.     Honey is an excellent high energy food source.     Stores easily and will last indefinitely.     H2O2, Hydrogen Peroxide     Can be used to sterilize wounds.     Will kill bacteria and provide oxygen to the body.     Can  be ingested in small amounts. See "Oxygen Therapies", by   EdMcCabe.     He's available at 1-800-256-08372     Sun Chlorella or Blue-green Algae     A very important tools for our health and our survival.     Here  lie  all the vitamins and minerals that our bodies  need  tostay  healthy.  Also chlorella helps eliminate toxins while at the sametime  rebuilding  our  cell walls. It is the cell walls  that  transfernutrition  into a substance that our body needs. Death is  the  processwhen  our  cell  walls no longer are being rebuilt. Read  "Gem  of  theOrient" by  Bernard Jensen.     Chlorella     Is  a complete food. If you can't get either of these then use anygreen algae like Spirulina, Green Magma, or wheat grass.  Chlorella  isone  of  the  best  sources of chlorophyll, containing  100  times  thechlorophyll of wheat grass!     Vit C     Helps  you  in many ways. By allowing a strong immune system,  andregulating vital hormones, helping the skin, and the liver to eliminatetoxins,  and  the kidneys to do the same, helping eye sight,  and  muchmore.  Promotes healing.     Vit E     Is essential for healing.     Beta-caratone     Which the body converts into Vit A.     Calcium     Is  a  natural  pain  killer and important for bone  building  andrepair     Golden Seal     Promotes healing while controlling infection.     Cyclone Cider     Will help you fight off a cold and other bacterial infections.     Melaleuca Oil,     From  Australia,  promotes healing. Excellent  for  cuts,  stings,infections and Fights bacteria.     Echinacea & Goldenseal     Combination should be used at first sign of illness.     Calendula     Promotes healing, Great for cuts and burns.     Comfrey     Promotes healing. Use on cuts, burns.     Sulfur     Can be used for cuts, infections.     Castor oil     Protects skin and cuts.     Healing Clay     Is useful for removing toxins from system.     Since this is not a survival book as such, I am not going into thevarious  survival tools you will need to have together such  as  water,food, shelter, first-aid, resources, etc. There are many survival booksavailable. For more information read "Survival into the 21st  Century",by Victor Kulvinskas.     One thing for certain concerning survival; it is important to stayaway  from  `quick'  chemicals. The solution is  to  stick  to  naturalproducts  when  ever possible. Avoid anything that will  further  upsetNature's balance.     Happy Growing     Organically of course!

Just as a human body that isn't properly fed is wide opento  attack from one illness or another, so it is with plants.  Chemicalfertilizers  are  not  complete foods. They  lack  almost  all  of  theimportant trace minerals. There are over 70 trace minerals that  plantsand  humans need, and chemical fertilizers provide only a few of  them.If plants do not get the trace minerals they need, as well as a varietyof enzymes and bacteria, they will become stressed and will be attackedby disease, or pests.    Ants, like most predatory insects, attack plants that are sick  orstressed.  This is a natural law, like the wolf who only  attacks  sicksheep.  I  do  not  recommend the use of chemical fertilizers.  If  youpresently  are using these fertilizers and want to stop, be  forewarnedthat  you  must proceed slowly and carefully as you make the transitionfrom  chemical fertilizers to exclusively pure organics. As an addict depends  ondrugs, plants depend on chemical fertilizers for their `hits' and won'taccept  organic  food  at first. Time is needed  to  allow  the  plantsnatural  systems to begin to work again. Give yourself and your  plantsat  least a year to go from chemicals to organics. It may take  severalyears of growing organically for the soil to return to life and for theorganic materials to kick in. Use the following schedule in making  theorganic transition.  First Month     Keep using the same amount of chemical fertilizer but also spray aliquid seaweed blend (such as Superseaweed, or Nitron or Agri-Gro )  asa  foliar  feeder.  Make sure the soil is in good condition by  applyinglots  of rich live compost.   Stop using any chemical pesticides.  Startusing the many methods mentioned in this book.  Second Month     Reduce  the  amount  of chemical fertilizer  by  one third,  whilecontinuing  to spray the leaves of your plants with the liquid  seaweedaccording to the instructions (Superseaweed is five drops per  gallon).Replace  the  chemical fertilizer with a good compost such  as  Organa.Apply  more compost around plants, turn over soil when possible.  Mulchwell.  Third Month     By  now  you should have reduced the amount of chemical fertilizerto  one half  the  original  amount  you  were  using  before  andincreased  the  amount  of organic fertilizer to replace  the  chemicalfertilizer.  In other words, you are now using one part organic and  onepart  chemical. You will find that during these months your plants willbe  under  a  great  deal  of stress and may  be  attacked  by  variouspredatory  bugs.  Use only organic methods to get  rid  of  them.  Keepspraying the leaves with a good liquid seaweed weekly or monthly. Fourth to Eighth month     Stay on the 50/50 basis. This is a good time to see how the plantsare  responding to their new organic regime. Some plants will not  likeit  at  all and may even die, but the majority of plants will  do  verywell.  Keep spraying the leaves as often as recommended (as above).  Ninth month     Reduce  the  use  of chemical fertilizers by  half  again,  andincrease  your  organic  fertilizer/compost.  Follow  with  a   monthlyspraying of liquid seaweed.   Tenth month-Twelfth month     Repeat the process. By now you should be using one-quarter of yourchemical fertilizer with three quarters organic fertilizer. This is thelevel  you want to stay at for the next two months.  By the end of  thefirst  year you should have reduced your chemical usage by 80  percent.You should also have increased your organic usage by 80 percent.  Duringthe next few years you should work on reducing the chemicals used by  �then, eventually not using any chemicals at all. Then you'll be 100% Organic!     Any  problems  your  plants  may have  can  be  treated  with  theappropriate organic controls.

By following the simple formula above , every can contribute theirshare to the recovery of the earth. ReduceThis is a simple way of say we can do just a well with less then wethink. We don't have to lower the quality of a our lives when wereduce. There are many things that we can use less of while increasingthose things we need more of. The lesson here is keeping balance in anever changing world. ReuseThere are many things that can be reused. Many things inded. Somanyinfact to mention here. Just look around your home. How many thingsdo you see that you don't haveto throw away but can reuse instead? Muchmore then you realize. Also to reuse can also mean let some one elsereuse what you have? Pass it along. From TV to Cars from shirts topants. Pass it along to a friend or someone in need. RecycleOK so we know what this means , good for you. So now recycle! More andmore cities are being forsed to look at how they deal with these issuesand they are forced to implement new rules and regulations to controlthem. Recycle differs from reusing simply by the fact that it is notyouwho is reusing them! Recycle means that they go back to a central plantwhich melts, changes them back into a state that they then can changeinto what ever product they want it to be like a can of beer forexample. While reuseing is smore simple then that. You reuse at home,everything is recycled. RethinkThis process is what keeps us  a breast of what must be changed inorder to keep up with evolution.Change occurs when we fail to keep upwith the changes ocurring around us. Change also happens when werealize or make a leap into another plane another level ofconscoiusness. As we rethink we grow. ReplantThis is probably our last hope of ever bring back the great foreststhat once covered the earth. This may neverhappen but we must try. Byplanting more and more trees each year, it will takes thousands ofyears for the earth to recover, after all whats a thousand years ortwo?

First,  in center place a large pile of animal manure such as horseor  cow  or  rabbit or Llama pellets. The pile should be about  2  feethigh.  Water  lightly.   Place the following  layers:  Layer  in  plantwaste(hay,  grass clippings,leaves etc). Use your  own grass clippings,and   leaves  to  make sure toxins are low (or ask  if  using  someoneselse's  grass clippings). Sprinkle a thin layer of either alfalfa  meal,nature  meal or composted manure (do not use cat or dog manure)  or  anynitrogen  rich material. Spray this with a liquid seaweed mixture.  Youcan  use Superseaweed� for this as it makes a good compost starter. Add1  cup Nitron A-35, or Agrigro or any other natural product. Add a 2 inchlayer  of  rock  dust covering with a 2 inch layer of top soil.  Water  tomoisten.   Superseaweed� is available at:  The Invisible Gardener  Inc.Other  Compost  Starters are available at the following outlets:   A-35Nitron  Industries, Inc; they make various compost starters and compostbins. Nitron A35,  Necessary Trading Company; a great source of compoststarters  and  soil  thermometer,  Aerators  and  many  other   organicproducts, Peaceful Valley Farm Supply;  another good source of  compoststarters, thermometers. and  various organic materials, Gardens Alive!;they carry many composting products, Mellingers, Inc; they carry a  bigline  of  compost starters, organic materials etc. See Also Arbico  forcomposting  supplies.  When you write to these  folks,  tell  them  theInvisible Gardener sent you!. 2nd Day     1 inch  layer plant waste or kitchen wastes, 1 inch layer alfalfa  meal,water  to  moisten,  1 inch layer kelpmeal or dried  seaweed,   2 inch  layermanure(rabbit,goat,Llama pellets), 2 inch layer plant  waste (leaves,  pineneedles),  1inch  layer  minerals  (rock  dust  or  granite,  gypsum,  orgreensand,oyster shell), 2 inch layer manure cover, 1 inch  layer  top  soil,water  to  moisten, 1 inch layer rock dust (a good fertilizer and anti  flydust),  1 inch  layer  kelpmeal.  Spray with  a  liquid  seaweed  such  asSuperseaweed�. Cover with a clear plastic or tarp. 3rd day     Allow to sit. 4th day     Allow  to  sit,  take  temp (with  soil  thermometer),  leave  pilecovered,  add  a 1 inch layer of rock dust covering 1inch layer  top  soil,water to moisten. 5th Day     Allow to sit 6th day     Take temp, temp should be rising every day till reaches 160 F. Thetemp may go higher but should stop no higher then 180 degrees F. If thetemp does continue to rise add water to cool down. 7th day       Allow to sit, check temp 8th day     Uncover  pile and allow to sit open for a day, check  temp,  checkfor odors (should smell of ammonia) 9th Day     Turn  pile  over,  spraying with the liquid  seaweed  as  you  go,turning  the pile: This is done by one of several methods...the easiestbeing using a front end loader to turn the pile over; or use the shoveltechnique.  The main idea is to turn the pile over in such a  way  thatyou  are turning the layers together except for the center of the pile.The easiest way to do this is the volcano method. The Volcano method.     This  is  when you dig into the center of the pile making it  looklike  a  volcano has just erupted, then you throw everything back  intothe  center  of the pile mixing it up and watering lightly as  you  go.Cover the pile with clear plastic.The clear plastic has several functions:     1:  It  solarizes  the  compost destroying  harmful  bacteria   2:solarization  breaks down various inorganic compounds  and  allows  fortheir  disposal. 3: the clear plastic is a good control  against  flieslaying  eggs  in  your compost pile. The plastic also protects  againstrain. Day 10-15:     Allow  to  sit, Check temp every two days, if not hot  enough  addnitrogen rich materials such as bloodmeal, if too hot add water to cooldown then add more humus or soil to increase nitrogen:carbon ratio. Day 16:     Uncover  pile,check temp, turn pile as described before . add  1lbalfalfa meal, 1lb cottonseedmeal use only organic, 5lbs rock dust, 5lbskelpmeal, 1 lb epson salts,1 lb greensand. Stir together in bucket  andsprinkle a thin layer as you turn over pile. Then spray liquid seaweed.The  pile should be turned over completely, making sure pile is not toowet  (soaky)  and  not,  dry  but moist. Cover  pile  with  plastic  ifpossible. Day 17-21.     Allow  to  sit,checking temp every three days. Keep notes  on  thetemp  and compare. Is it still rising or is it falling? The temp shouldcontinue  to  rise until it reaches 160 or higher. Then the  temp  willlevel off. At the point where the temp starts to drop that is the  timeto  turn  the  pile over again. This usually happens around  the  20-30day,depending on the weather. Day 22nd  Uncover  pile  and turn over while spraying with the liquid  seaweed.     After this the plastic cover is not needed. Day 23-30  Allow  to sit watering lightly to keep moist. Make sure to spray with     a liquid seaweed mixture. Day 31:     Turn  pile over lightly, (aerate the pile by turning over  the  toplayers). Day 32-45:     Allow to sit checking the temp every 4 days. Day 46:     Turn pile over while spraying with liquid seaweed mixture Day 47-60:       Allow  pile  to  sit , water once every three days.  Check  temp  every time before watering.Your compost is ready!!

Rarely  is   energyassociated with food quality, plant and human health, though it is  thecorner stone of all three. It is energy, the energy of metabolism, thatdetermines  the  health of all living organisms. Most people  think  ofchemistry  in  their  discussions of plant growth and  human  nutritioncompletely  missing the fact that it is the energy of  metabolism  thatkeeps  life sustained. Let us look a moment at photosynthesis which  isacknowledged to be the root of all life as we know it on this planet.         In  a nutshell photosynthesis is the process of capturing  thesun's  energy  and  storing it in the bonds of a sugar  molecule.  Thissugar  is  then processed primarily through the Kreb's or  Citric  AcidCycle  to  produce  various organic compounds and high  energy  storagephosphate  compounds, eg. ATP. This energy is utilized  by  the  livingorganisms,  ie. plant and animal, like living factories, to  live,  eg.repair,  replace, and grow new cells and tissue. This  process  can  becompared  to building a house. One can have all the building  materialsnecessary for the house but without the labor force(energy) to put  thematerials together, it is just a pile of material.       Nature  stores  energy  in  carbon based  compounds.  These  areeffectively  consumed and recycled by living organisms thus maintainingthe  power(energy) necessary for life to be sustained.  When  a  persondies-expires- this energy of life is exhausted and rigomortis sets  in.If  the  flesh is left to nature it rots- is consumed by microorganismsand   enzymes.  the  "body" returns to its basic building  blocks.  Thehuman  Organism  is the most complex life form on earth  requiring  themost  complex variety of materials and the highest degree of energy  tomaintain  life.  There  are actually an eschelon of  sophistication  innature   with  the  microorganisms  being  least  and  man   the   mostsophisticated. The importance of this concept lies with  the  mechanismby  which  "building  materials"  and  fuel(energy)  are  supplied  andmaintained for the various life forms on this planet.   Nature providesa  means for the escalation of energy sophistication from raw inorganicmineral to living human being. When honored, this  process provides forhealthy living organisms all along the eschelon.        When  dishonored, this process allows for the  organism  to  bediverted  to  sickness and disease and perhaps death  if  the  organismfails to remedy dishonorment. Contrary to popular belief, sickness  anddisease  are  not  "predators" lurking around every corner  seeking  anunsuspecting, innocent victim. In agriculture insect pests and diseasesare  not  due  to a deficiency of toxic pesticides and in human  healthpathogens  and  diseases are not due to a deficiency of antibiotics  ordrugs.  They are nature's mechanism for maintaining vibrant,  permanentliving  residents  of  the earth. Disease and  sickness  are  just  themessenger carrying the warning to clean up one's act or expire.        Man in his arrogance seeks to kill the messenger not liking themessage  thereby condemning himself to a life of pain   and  suffering.Sound too philosophical to be valid in the "real world?"   Lets take  alook at this escalating process in nature.  In the soil and air are thebasic  elements  necessary to build the "bodies" of  living  organisms.These elements in their raw form are of little value however, to plantsand  above. they must be "manipulated"  by microorganisms in the  soil.Via  this manipulation the raw elements are complexed with basic carbonvarieties forming organic compounds with a quantity of energy  capturedby  the  microorganisms  from  the environment.  This  is  an  anabolicprocess.  These organic compounds are either excreted/secreted  by  themicroorganism  or assimilated as a part of the microbe's  body.  Eitherway  these compound (the latter upon microbial death) will be  consumedby other microbes and eventually plants- the next step up the eschelon.Combined  with  the products of photosynthesis these  acquired  organiccompounds are assimilated and/or metabolized into plant  parts and  /orsecretion/excretions.  In  the process of  assimilation  an  additionalquantity of energy is added by the plant.   The plants are then in turnconsumed by animals and man  providing them with both the nutrition andthe energy necessary to sustain them in perfect health.     Each step along the way from raw element to man adds a quantity ofenergy  and  sophistication to the food source making it  possible  foreach  level to live free of disease.   Perfect heath is the  key  issuehere  for as soon as we present this concept from raw element to  finalconsumption someone will chime in that "modern" farmers fertilize cropswith  inorganic fertilizers, grow crops hydroponically and feed animalsraw  mineral.  Yes, that is absolutely correct; however,  what  is  thehealth status of our planet? Poor, at best. Living  organisms live  offthe  energy  from  their  food. One can build  a  house  with  inferiorbuilding materials and skimp on fasteners and initially the house looks"good"  from  the outside but as soon as a storm comes the  roof  blowsoff   or  the  whole  things  falls  down.  Yes,  we  can  grow   cropsinorganically  but  we  will  then have to rescue  them  from  nature'sgarbage  collectors(insects and disease) by spraying toxic  pesticides.These crops do not have sufficient nutritional  nor energy integrity tosustain  animal  or human health as a result animals + humans  contractsickness and disease accordingly.

Laying out your garden     Draw a plan for what you want to grow in your raised bed. Keep thetallest on one side with the smallest to the opposite side. If you havemore  then one raised decide which plants will grow where. Change  thisdesign  every year so as not to grow the same plants in the same  placeyear after year. Location     Choosing  a  location for your raised bed is very  important.  Thelocation  needs to be close to the kitchen to provide easy  access  forthe  cook.  The location must provide at least 6 to 8 hrs  direct  sun,with  the  more the better. Must have proper drainage. So take  a  walkaround  your  place and see if you can pick the perfect  spot.  Anotherconsideration is water, it must have a close source. Garden Filter     Never  use  city  water  in  your raised  bed.  Many  cities  havechlorine(or  ?) in their city water. Chlorine kills bacteria,  that  iswhat  it does best. However an organic garden requires natural bacteriain  order  to function correctly. A garden filter will help  keep  yourgarden  alive!  You  will notice an increase in in  worms  and  in  thegardens  overall health. An excellent Garden Filter is  available  thruReal Goods. Putting together the Raised Bed     A  good raised bed should be at least 4ft x 10 ft x 12 inches highx  at  least  2  inches thick. Use non treated wood. The  wood  can  bescrewed  together for easy break down when needed. If you have  gophersin  your  area,  you will want to screen the bottom  with  extra  heavychicken  wire.  The size of the bed depends on the area and  amount  ofspace you have to use. An ideal situation is to have two or more raisedbeds. One 4ft x 12ft x 12 inches x 2 inches can produce enough food fora  family of four. More beds allow you to rotate the beds and allow onebed to grow green cover which can be turned over. Filling in the Raised BedThe  following should fit just right into the raised bed. You will haveto use what you find in your area.     Start  out  with a good layer of old horse manure. To this  I  addeither   LLama   pellets  or  Rabbit  pellets(nature's  time   releasedfertilizer). Add 20 lbs of rock dust or any other trace mineral source.Add  20  lbs bone meal, 20 lbs alfalfa meal and 2 bales aged wood.  Mixwell. Water well(water slowly to allow soil to absorb). To this mixtureadd  500  lbs compost(if you have it) other wise add enough  old  horsemanure  to  fill up to 4 inches from the top. Add another 2 bales  agedwood  or  KRA wood product or any light soil. Add another 20  lbs  rockdust,  20 lbs bone meal, 20 lbs alfalfa meal. The aged wood will insurethe  PH will be at the right place. A good PH for the garden is 6.5  to6.8.  Blend  everthing in together, watering as  you  go.  Finally  addenough  mulch to fill the raised bed up to the top. Remember that  thissoil will settle after a few days, so keep a few bags of mulch handy tofill to top when needed.

It is anexcellent  way of recycling. It is allways best to compost  your  mulchbefore  using.  Never mulch around plants with freshly cut  mulch  fromtrees  or grass clippings. This will burn the plants. What is the difference between mulch and compost?     Compost  is the food and mulch protects the food from the elementslike rain and the sun which will dry it out. Mulch will hold water  andnot  allow the soil/compost to dry out. A good mulch is made from  agedwood. This is wood which has beed recycled from cut trees and compostedorganically.  Often  my companies add urea to their  compost  believingthat the compost needs this "chemical" nitrogen. So ask before you buy!Urea  based  products are very detrimental to the soils  organisms  andshould  not be used. Instead horse manure can be added. Rock dust  willalso work well here as rock dust will bind the nutrition together.

At which timeI  did  most  of my gardening at night during the light  of  the  moon.Gardening  by  the  moon  is an experience in  itself  (that's  anotherarticle)  which  teaches  one about cycles  and  energy  and  how  theyinteract   with each other and living things as well: any way The  nameInvisible  Gardener  really  comes from a  deep  understanding  of  theimportance of the inner garden and the outer garden.     In  my garden lies the secrets of the universe. In my garden  liesmy  beginning and my end. In my garden is truth, beauty and bliss. Suchis  the nature of the garden and not just limited to the garden but  toall  of the earth and beyond!  The outer Reality is a reflection on theinner Reality. Which is more real? Within a tree, within a rose, withina  fish,  within a flower, within Suns, Moons and Stars  lies  the  onesource.     A successful gardener learns to cultivate the relationship betweenbeing human of the earth and a being of the cosmos.     How  often have you heard the expression To Discover the  Universego within?       Go  where?  Within yourself. Whether you go within  yourself  orwithin a rose, you will find the same thing, the same truth lies there.     To be in control over life is a very special gift usually reservedfor  the Gods themselves. What is this life that I talk about? The lifewithin the seed waiting to be released! You have the power to not  onlyinject  life  into a seed but to effect its out come! Whether  it  willlive  or  die is now up to you! Whether it is healthy all its  life  orwhether  it  is  sick all of the time is up to you. When  you  come  tounderstand  how important your input is to the process, you  will  takeit  more  seriously. Treat life with more respect. Not to  poison  lifewith  pesticides, not to push it with fertilizers, not to destroy  lifewith pollution of any kind.     One  of the greatest joys any human being can have is to grow yourown  food, grow your own life! As you practice your art of growing, yourepeat the same patterns that farmers have been using for thousands  ofyears.  It  is this process of learning to care for the earth,  of  howeverything is inter changed, intertwined: your very breath is a  plantsair which it in turns breaths in and provides life to it.       It is very difficult to find the true meaning of life if all youare  doing  is  killing everything, if all you are doing  is  pollutingeverything.  It is no wonder that everywhere one looks one finds  deathand  pollution. This is because we have not remembered the old  fashionway of growing, one that connects you to the earth not separating you.     Inner  gardening  is  more  of a raising  of  consciousness  or  acultivation  of  consciousness  then  actually  growing  food  but  theactualization is important as it provides for the physical needs.     In other words you don't have to have a garden plot in order to doinner  gardening. Simply put you develop this inner garden within  yourinner being, you cultivate the inner garden within us all.     This  inner garden can have anything you want in it. You can  growinner roses, yes a rose garden within yourself, within your being, willbe  just as beautiful as the rose grown in the earth. Actually a  innerrose  will  have  an extraordinary fragrance that will  be  capable  oftouching your inner soul.       Anything  you  grow within this garden will be of that  etherealnature that is not found in any earthly garden.     As  you  go  through life, as you live from day to  day,  you  cancultivate  this  garden by developing an inner sight of  what  you  seearound you in "real life". I place quotes on real because what we thinkis real is really the medium and not the message so to speak.     What  is the message of the inner garden? That life promotes  lifeand  death  promotes death. To kill off all insects and other creaturesof  the earth in the name of life is wrong. Life is not life if  it  isnot  connected to the energy that is all. Life is not life  if  it  notconnected  to  the source. We as human beings have developed  an  anti-connection attitude. It is this very attitude that will be the  end  ofus  all. We are condemning are children, our children's children  to  alife  of  pain  and  suffering. Make hay today and  don't  worry  abouttomorrow.   Make  the  big  bucks  now  and  don't  worry   about   theconsequences. This is a very bad attitude to take. Take a look at  whatwe are doing to the trees of this planet.     Where  once  forests were all over this planet, forests  from  onecontinent  to  another, where once jungles, rain forests  out  numbereddeserts,  where the USA was covered with trees from end to  the  other,where the earth was one massive forest, shall I go on?      I will.     We  have cut them down for our immediate needs, uncaring about theeffects  it may have on our home, the earth. The effects of  this  goesbeyond  immediate  effects felt during the  same  year  they  were  cut(immediate effects to birds, insects, other trees, wind, erosion, etc.)but  the  long term effects it will have upon the billions of lives  onthis  planet, trillions of insect lives, animal lives, sea life,  plantlife.  We may have just speeded up our exhibition. What took the  earthhundreds of thousands of years to get it together, we have destroyed inless  then  a  few  thousand years! With the  majority  of  the  damageoccurring  within the last hundred years (over 85% of the earth  foresthave been cut down within the last 50 years!)!     The  effects of what this uncontrolled damage to the worlds  treesmay  never be measured. We cannot un due what has been done (replantingis  a  start but will take a min. of  100 years (mother nature actuallywould  prefer a few thousand years) before these re planted  tree  willbegin  to  have the same effect on the earth as had their predecessors,but  we  can  understand what we are doing that's wrong  and  begin  toredirect our energies in the right direction.     My  teachings provide people with a foundation from which to  workwith. By following the 5 R's..     1.....Reduce..2.....Re-use......2.......Recycle.....3.....Rethink......4.....Replant,we  will make  a  difference,  we will give hope to our children  and  to  theirchildren     What  about  what  we are doing to ourselves by  ignoring  natureslaws?     Take   Americans for example. Americans are the sickest people  inthe world!     Here  are some figures from the Post, Times and USA Today for  theyear 1996:     1 million Americans have Parkinson disease     50 million       "            "     hyper tension     12.4 million     "           "     asthma     53 million        "           "     migraine headaches     28 million        "           "     hearing loss     18  million         "                  abuse alcohol or  drugs  or both     40 million          "           "      arthritis      2 million         "            "       brain damage     25 million        "            "       osteoporosis     5 million          "            "     elevated ocular pressure     2 million to 3 million          glaucoma     10   million                             temporomandibular   joint disorders     16 million                            obesity     20 million to 25 million who annually drink pesticide contaminatedwater with another   50  million  American  who eat pesticide, fertilizer  contaminated food     3 million to 7 million  American suffer from food borne disease     4 million                               Alzheimer's disease     15 million                            type II diabetes     59 million                            heart disease     40 million                            impotence     3 million                               cancer     1 million                              chronic fatigue     20 million                            neck to knee disease     12 million                           restless leg syndrome     50 million                           hay fever     this is not counting                                                 multiple sclerosis                                                 lupus                                                  cystic fibrosis                                                  tubercul                                                 measles                                                 aids                                                 rabies                                                etc...     That comes to at least 543 million disease ridden Americans, whichmeans  that in a country with only 266 million people( many  have  morethen one disease), Americans are the sickest people in the world!    I wonder why?     We  are  polluting  ourselves through many  different  means  frompesticides to nuclear waste. In order to achieve our goal of being  theriches  nation  in the world we have become the sickest nation  in  theworld.  Americans have hit upon the perfect death sentence.  They  havedeveloped this to an art. Dam the torpedoes full steam ahead!     To  destroy  our environment while at the same time poisoning  ourfood, water and earth, air, river, lake, oceans, mountains, etc.  is  aperfect way to slowly kill off living things upon this planet. To  makematters  worse,  the rest of the world is following in  America's  footsteps(  by the way, I haven't even mentioned war , agriculture and  themedical profession!It is no wonder that we have so many illnesses in our society. Rememberthe basic law of nature which says "As above so below"? What that meanspertaining to what I have just mentioned is that as you use toxins youwill become toxic! As you destroy the external world you also destroythe internal world, that inner world that is so important. You cannothave one without the other- you cannot affect one with affecting theother.I truly believe that every illness or disease previously mentioned is adirect result of this self abuse of the inner world through the mis useof the outer world. By poisoning ourselves with one chemical oranother, by poisoning ourselves with one chemical fertilizer oranother(yes fertilizers), by poisoning ourselves with herbicides,fungicides, by poisoning ourselves with food additives, preservations,coloring, stabilizers, etc., by poisoning our water with flurried,chlorine, etc., by poisoning ourselves through improper heathpractices(drugs, alcohol, sexual abuse, mental abuse, spiritual abuse),buy starving ourselves through food grown improperly and which have nofood value, by posioning ourselves through products that are supposedto be safe for us to either intake, ingest, inject, some how apply toour bodies, we are poisoning ourselves by surrounding ourselves withelectrical fields, poisonous gases(exhaust from auto, trucks,industries, etc.), we are poisoning ourselves by living within toxicstructures that promote illness and diseases, structures that do notfollow nature laws and separate or dis connect us from the earth ( ourshoes are made to separate us from our earth connection( when was thelast time you walk on a filed bare footed?).All of these things add to one very sick society of people no longerwith goals of life and happiness but of self destruction.We are constantly producing new diseases at an alarming rate,diseases never found on this planet several years ago.Where does all this lead to? It doesn't paint a pretty picture.But don't give up! There is hope! Knowledge is a very powerful weaponagainst this. Knowledge will set you free. The simple art of readingthis makes you aware of the true problem. Your consciousness has justbeen raised a little bit enough for you no longer to be the same personyou were before you started reading this.Don't let others determine your happiness or your health.

There are many  differentgroups  of flies, from the common housefly to the hover fly. But  whenwe  think  of flies we think of filth flies. Flies which are associatedwith  human-generated garbage and animal manure. Many species of  fliesare  predators  or  parasitoids  of other  insects.  Their  larvae  eatdecomposing  animal bodies. Flies carry many different  diseases  whichcan affect humans as well. There are over 85,000 species of flies. Here are some well known varieties of Flies: Fruit Flies:      Live  in  ripe  fruits , garbage, and rotting  vegetables.  Propercleaning of the area is important here.     Keep Garbage can tightly covered and remove all rotting materials. Black Cherry Fruit Fly:        prefers sour Cherries. The Cherry Fruit Fly:        prefers Cherry, Pear, and Plum. The Currant Fruit Fly:      prefers Currents and Gooseberries. The Oriental Fruit Fly and The Mediterranean Fruit Fly:      Have a wide range of tastes including many Citrus fruits, such  asPeach, Nectarine, Plum, Grapefruit,     Orange, Apple, Pear, Coffee and many more fruits and vegetables. The  Mexican Fruit Fly:        A pest of Citrus fruits, Mangoes, and many other fruits. Carrot Rust Fly:      The  Host plants are Carrot, Celery, Parsnip, and Parsley. Maggotscan cause damage to root systems.     Soft-rot usually follows. Maggots winter in soil. The  Common House Fly:        Prefers garbage, manure rotting fruits, vegetables. Syrphid Fly:      They  hover like bees. Attracted to tree sap and fermenting fruit,are predaceous and feed on aphids, mealybugs and other insects. One  ofthe good guys! Tachinid Fly:      Beneficial. Parasitic on other insects. One of the good guys! More about the FLYHabitats:     Primary  food  sources  for filth flies is  human  waste  such  asgarbage, and pet manure.Growth Cycles:     Goes through four stages in life cycles; Egg, Larva, Pupa and  theAdult. If you interrupt any part of the cycle, you have gained control._______________________________ Last Update: 12/25/96 Web Author: Andrew Lopez Copyright �1997 by The Invisible Gardener - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WT03-B17-310IA072-000462-B037-25http://www.invisiblegardener.com:80/th22001.htm 207.158.219.161 19970121021938 text/html 4220HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 02:19:34 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 07:54:13 GMTETag: "c3ff85-f8b-32dddea5"Content-Length: 3979Accept-Ranges: bytes Natural Snail Control Basics Natural Snail Control Basics                               Snail Tales How to Control Snails Organically     Most problems with snails can be explained by the law of cause andeffect.  The snail problem that many gardeners encounter is a  reactionand  not  a cause. Snail infestation occurs when the soil is no  longeralive  because  the organisms within it have been killed with  chemicalfertilizers, pesticides or thru otherwise bad soil care. The  continueduse  of  snail killer year after year destroys the soil and upsets  thebalance.  This is the cause.  Dead soil will not support life, thereforethe delicate balance which nature maintains has been upset. It is thisbalance  that protects all living beings on our planet. Deal  with  thecause  and the effect will disappear. Here are some steps you can  taketo control snails on your property. Step 1: Dealing with Snails     Whenever there is an infestation of any one pest,  the balance  ofnature   has  been  upset.  Anything  not  naturally  found  in  naturecontributes   to   this  imbalance,  including  chemical   fertilizers,pesticides, herbicides, weed killers, snail killers or any other poisonand/or  synthetic  toxin. If you have been using any form  of  chemicalsnail  control  year after year to keep snails away from your  flowers,vegetables,  etc., the first and most important step is to  stop  usingany  form  of  chemical snail bait whatsoever. Another reason  to  stopusing snail poison is that it also kills birds and other friendly  crit-ters that you may like having around your home1. They are here for  thesnails  too.  If  you  want to deal with snails effectively,  you  willsucceed only if you understand that chemical fertilizers are as bad foryour  soil's health as pesticides are bad for your health. You must  bewilling  to commit yourself to growing without chemicals of  any  kind.Because your plants need a period of transition, start by reducing yourchemical  use  by half during the first 3 months, then completely  stopthe chemical use after that period._______________________________     1..Dogs have been known to eat this stuff and die from it!

Crop rotation, green cover crops,  traps,  barriers,   hand  picking,  biological  controls, organic  products,  and  cultural   controls   such  as  companion  planting  methods,  planting  resistant   varieties  of plants, organic fertilization, using compost  and  proper   watering   are some of the alternatives to these chemicals   Pesticides   cannot  replace  good  gardening habits  and  techniques,  despite  the   constant  advertising  to  the contrary.  Chemical's  treat   only  the   effect; good gardening practices correct the cause. Remember, eliminate   the  cause  and you eliminate  its effects. It's just not as simple  as   the ads would have it. Pesticides appear to help, but they do not, by a   long  shot. In fact, while 300 insect species were listed as  resistant   to  pesticides  in  1970,  by 1996, 880 were.   We  rely  too  much  on   agricultural chemicals and instead of good gardening practices.      All  Garden  Centers  sell  chemical products to rid  you  of  insects,   fungi,  disease, animals, or weeds. These include all forms of  organic   or  synthetically  produced pesticides.   The  term  pesticides  covers   anything  that   controls any type of pest or disease.  Pesticides  are   supposed to control these. Because pesticides work only on a short term   basis  (given time pests and diseases become immune to the  pesticide),   new     formulations,   or  slightly  different   mixtures   of   these   ingredients, are constantly being developed  just to provide some  type   of  control.   Over  the last few decades, there has been  an  enormous   increase  in  the amount of chemicals, both pesticides and fertilizers,   that people put on their gardens and lawns. This has been costly to the   environment,  & to our health. Misuse causes health problems  later  on   not to mention death or immediate injury to ourselves, our children and   our  pets.  Chemicals are very much like some prescription drugs,  they   can  appear to be helping in curing a specific  illness or aliment, but   not  only  is it not the answer to the problem (doesn't deal  with  the   cause)  but  it  can additional problems if relied upon  on  a  regular   basis. There is no such thing as a "safe" pesticide, a pesticide has to   be toxic for it to work. ABOUT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM)      Integrated Pest Management, or IPM,  uses chemicals or  pesticides   as   well  as  natural,  physical controls.    Emphasis is placed on finding   the "least toxic" method  of control.  While I understand that this  is   a  step in the right direction, this is not the answer. IPM does  teach   people  the basics of good gardening but still allows you to use "least   Toxic  chemicals".  While this method does help to reduce  the  use  of   pesticides, it is mis leading to the general public. People  think  IPM   means  Organic  and  therefore think they are  buying  totally  organic   produce,  etc.  This is not the case at all. Many people  are  just  as   allergic to these chemicals and most importantly, in my opinion,  there   are  no  safe  pesticides. You cannot mix chemicals with Organics.  You   cannot deal with the cause in this way, since the true cause is the use   of  chemicals. Also least toxic can mean using such famous chemicals as   Malathion,  Sevin,  etc. since these chemicals are considered  safe  by   some  professionals as well as the Dept. of Agriculture. Its a case  of   the fox guarding the chicken coop. Think about it people, the dept.  of   Agri  says  that Malathion is so safe that you can spray a  whole  city   with it!  Think LA!  Therefore it can be conceivably used in IPM as the   "least  toxic" ! There are many chemicals that fall into this category.   This  is  just a clever way for the pesticide companies to keep selling   their  pesticides to farmers and to professionals, and to  the  general   public. Don't fall for it!      I  understand  the problem farmers, professionals, and  gardeners  have   with pest and disease control. I understand that people have to be fed.   I   understand that the world looks to us to develop methods of  farming   that  produces enough food to feed us all. These things are obvious  to   all  of  us but what's really obvious to some of us is that the use  of   chemicals is a dead end road only making lots of money for the chemical   companies at the cost of jeopardizing our future!      Take  for example Trees. What is obvious to me is that we have  started   upon  the  path genocide. We are destroying the very system  that  life   depends  upon!   All Life on Earth depends upon massive forests  around   the  world  to regulate energy, heat, oxygen etc. Forests  are  natures   lungs as well as natures shock absorber. Look around the world or  even   better  look  outside  and what do you see? Is your  climate  acting  a   little  bit  weird? It doesn't matter where you live, the environmental   normal has changed. Where before the environment was lush full of  life   and  full  of  various animals, insects, etc.; now is  barren  lifeless   environment.  Flooding, storms of unusual magnitude,  earthquakes,  one   disaster  or  another,  starvation, deadly  viruses,  animals  becoming   extinct at an alarming rate, are all becoming the norm instead  of  the   unusual.  What  does this have to do with trees? How can  these  things   come  about  simply  by  cutting down trees? Everything  is  connected.   Everything!  What  we do to one part of the earth  effects  the  other.   Really very simple!      We  have done more damage to the environment in the last 50 years  then   in  all  of  the history of mankind! Over 80% of the worlds trees  have   been  cut!   While it is true that many lumber companies are replanting   trees, they seem to think that a newly planted tree can replace a  tree   that's  hundreds of years old! It will need at least 50 years to  begin   to  equal  what the tree did that was cut down. By cutting  down  these   trees  we  have weakened the earth's natural system of balance  and  to   make things worse we are using chemicals that cause imbalance to nature   as well as to ourselves!      With all the doom predictions these days very little hope is coming out   of this scenario. Very few people are promoting a better future for the   human  race.  Many  cultures have their own prophets,  each  describing   their  version of the future of mankind. These predications are governs   by  their ability to see the whole picture. While they do predict  doom   and disasters, they also predict hope and a alternative path for us  to   take. The Hopis have a ancient wall that describes everything that  has   happened  and where we are right now. The Hopis say that we as  a  race   have  taken the path of technology and have disconnected ourselves from   the  earth  and  her  ways.  The Hopis  also  say  that  we  are  at  a   conjunction,  that  at this moment in time, we as a  race  must  decide   which  path to take. The path of Technology will only work if we  merge   it  with  the  Spiritual path. We must choose to live a spiritual  life   first  then allow technology to provide us with the best it can provide   us.  Technology does not have to destroy, pollute or cause illness, any   more then living a spiritual life makes us monks.      What  will  save  this planet and its inhabitants from  destruction?  A   consciousness revolution! What does this mean? This is what  the  Hopis   means  by  connecting back to the earth and her ways. This is  what  is   meant by going inward to discover yourself and the true meaning of life   for  you.  This  is what is meant by living your life  to  its  fullest   extent  not by being the riches person on earth in terms of  money  but   being  rich inside yourself. Being rich in happiness and joy. Being  in   love  is  a special form of consciousness, one that allows you  to  see   things differently then before. We all have a consciousness but some of   us  have  their  consciousness in their wallets  instead  of  in  their   hearts. Notice I said Heart and not head. Consciousness does not reside   in  any part of your body but the special consciousness that comes from   the heart will not allow you to do any thing that will cause injury  to   any one else especially the earth.      What  people every where are crying out for is for something to  happen   that will cause an immediate raise in the consciousness of mankind as a   whole.  An  example would be if we were visited by beings from  another   planet!  Now  that would change the consciousness of  the  human  race!   Another example is religion. The one thing, in my opinion that religion   does  is that it raises the consciousness of those practicing it. There   are  many  ways  to raise ones consciousness, this is a separate  issue   entirely. A conscious person will not use chemicals at all! He  or  She   will  look  for ways to promote balance in their little ecosystems  and   rely on the basic laws of nature.      I practice AIPM. Advanced IPM. In this system no man made chemicals are   used. If it isn't found in nature, I don't use it!   You will find that if you are 99% Organic that 1% chemical will get you   every time!

Carpenter ants can be controlled     a lot easier by the homeowner than termites can be     controlled (see carpenter ants, in this same section, for control strategies).        Look in the yellow pages under termite    inspectors. Talk with them about termites verus carpenter ants.    See if they are willing to tell you    if your home does have termites or whether it has carpenter   ants.            Termite-detecting dogs are available, they are    called TADD dogs.    For more information call BIRC at 415-524-2567 and ask    them about TADD dogs and while you are at it,    order the book "Common Sense Pest Control".   They have a great chatper on Termites as well as much   information on other pests. a great book!  Tell 'em The Invisible   Gardener sent ya!

Never feed trees a chemical fertilizer.#2... Trees require regular watering. Use a drip system whenever possible. Avoid watering trunk of tree. Trees are just like women; they love slow deep watering.#3... Always use filtered or solarized or well water. Never use straight city water as it may contain chlorine or some other chemical that can poison the trees.  See Garden Filter page (coming soon).#4... Allow time for trees to Heal. The bigger the tree, the longer it will take to Heal.#5... Raise the energy level of the tree  thru the addition of compost rich in trace minerals and bacteria. Trees love rock Dust!#6... Know the law of cause and effect. Control the cause and you control the effects. Trees with high energy levels are not attacked by pests.#7... Don't cut down trees.#8... Learn your trees. Plant only trees that will grow in your area. Give your favorite tree a name.#9... Protect trees from dogs. Dog urine is very acidic and will injure the tree's root system.#10... Cultivate the soil regularly. The soil will get packed so that water and air may not reach the roots.#11... Mulch. Provide plenty of mulch.#12... Protect trees from people!#13... Do not poison the soil. Avoid spilling gasoline, paint, salt etc...#14... Remove any tight wire supports as this will strangle the tree as it grows.#15... Plant ground covers. They make a great living mulch which  conserves water. yours Andy Lopez The invisible Gardener Last Update: 12/25/96 Web Author: Andrew Lopez Copyright �1997 by The Invisible Gardener - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WT03-B17-324IA072-000464-B042-147http://www.invisiblegardener.com:80/th25004.htm 207.158.219.161 19970121024213 text/html 3891HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 02:42:13 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 07:55:19 GMTETag: "c3ff91-e42-32dddee7"Content-Length: 3650Accept-Ranges: bytes Immediate Help with Trees Immediate Help with Trees                        Immediate Help with Trees       For Immediate Relief:  First do the obvious,         1..... is the tree being watered properly?         2..... is it being fed properly?         3..... is it under stress?         4..... is it damaged?         5..... is a bug attacking it?         6..... is a disease attacking it?

What does that mean? They get healthy and stay healthy!  Due  to  its high mineral content, rock dust helps in all aspects  of     the plant's biological process.  All  aspects  from  absorption  of other minerals  to  production  of     enzymes is increased.  Plants and Animals are healthier.  Plants  and Animals fed rock dust have less stress and are therefore     not  going to be attacked by insects, diseases, etc. Less prone  to     attack.  Plants can handle stress better.  Plants  can absorb the minerals they need when they need it and  will     suffer   less  then  those  plants/animals  not  having  the proper     minerals their bodies need.  Plants and animals  live longer healthier lives.  Rock dust is a natural fertilizer.  One of Mother Nature's best fertilizers. No nitrogen here!  Non-polluting, biodegradable.  Mother Nature will use every bit of it!  Rock Dust is inexpensive compared to other mineral products.  This  is  of  course  provided  that you get  a  source  nearest  you     otherwise shipping can cost more then the rock dust!  Rock  Dust  increases  mineral content of the  soil  and  the  plants     growing on it.  Rock  Dust  is  high in calcium, iron, and all the other 76  minerals     needed by both plants and animals including us humans.  Mother Nature recommends it!

Making Your Own Organic Fertilizers     Growing  pest  free vegetables and fruits is in part dependent  onnot  using chemical fertilizers and, instead, to rely upon the  variousnatural resources available to us.  It is not within the scope of  thisbook to debate the difference(s) between organics and in-organics;  noris  it  my  intent  here  to  show why  you  should  not  use  chemicalfertilizers  or  if  a  plant can tell the difference  between  organicnitrogen  sources and chemical sources1. I am not here to convince  youthat you should go organic and not chemical2. These things you must have decided on your own.  I am here to passalong  to  you my knowledge of Organics. In this chapter, I will  coversome  basic ways that you can make your own organic fertilizers. Pleasenote that there are more and more organic fertilizers available on  themarket today, not all are 100% organic. Read the labels very carefully.The  physical structure of what we feed the Earth can be modified.  Forexample,  a  rock  can be crushed into powder, or garlic  made  into  aliquid. All these things are still subject to the laws of nature.  Theyare Bio degradable and non-toxic.              The Invisible Gardener says:            " High Nitrogen fertilizers contribute to  many                      insect & disease attacks."     High  nitrogen based fertilizers are like sugar to the human body.The  rush is great going in, but not the going down! Each time you  usehigh  nitrogen, it causes greater stress then before. Beyond  that  youwill  find other causes that attract pests and diseases. High  Nitrogenis like steroids for plants!                     The Invisible Gardener says:    "You can avoid many problems associated with high nitrogen usesimply by understanding the organic system of providing nitrogen as the                            plant needs it"_______________________________     1Which it can.     2Which you should Last Update: 12/28/96 Web Author: Andrew Lopez Copyright �1997 by The Invisible Gardener - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WT03-B17-337IA072-000462-B036-74http://www.invisiblegardener.com:80/th19001.htm 207.158.219.161 19970121021602 text/html 7978HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 02:16:00 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 07:52:42 GMTETag: "c794ec-1e38-32ddde4a"Content-Length: 7736Accept-Ranges: bytes About Rock Dust About Rock Dust   The Elixir of the Earth     To grow a greener lawn, have healthier trees, and cultivate biggervegetables, the soil needs to be enriched. Before reaching for that bagof  nitrates or other chemical fertilizers, the conscious homeowner  orfarmer  should stop for a moment to consider what needs to be put  backin  the  soil to enhance its life-giving properties. Like the magnifiedform  of  the  human  body, the earth has the  wondrous  capability  ofhealing  itself.  When forested areas of the world use up the  nutrientsin  the soil, the earth has a built-in remineralization system that canbe  learned  from and applied right in the back yard.  The  process  isknown as remineralization through rock dust application. John Hammaker,a  research scientist in Massachusetts, postulates that each ice age inthe  history  of the earth regenerated its topsoil.  When  the  planet'sforests  deplete  the  soils  of nutrients,  they  begin  to  die  off,releasing  their  stored carbon into the atmosphere.  All  this  carbonbuilds up in the atmosphere, creating a "greenhouse effect" and causinga the earth's temperatures to rise.    This  heat  is  most  concentrated around the  equator  where  thesunlight  is  greatest. The higher temperatures cause evaporation,  andthe  moisture rises, creating a vacuum underneath which pulls in coolerair  from the polar regions. As the air is pulled in from the North andthe  South,  another vacuum ensues, pulling the warm moist air  towardsthe  poles.  During  this time there is a lot of strong  activity  liketyphoons  and  hurricanes  that  occur  in  the  earth's  sub-tropicalregions. When the moist warm air from the tropics arrives in the  polarregions,  it hits the cooler temperatures and condensates as snow.  Thesnow  builds up, and the weight causes it to pack into the ice and pushsouthward from the north pole and northwards from Antarctica.  At  thistime  there is an increase in earthquakes and volcanoes caused  by  theextra  weight on the continents. The glaciers descend, grinding up  allrocks  and mountains in their path, remineralizing the soil.  When  theforests  again  take root, they absorb the carbon from  the  atmospherethrough photosynthesis, and the ice age diminishes.     Hammaker has extended this hypothesis to explain what is currentlyoccurring   on   earth  right  now.  According  to  Hammaker,   earth'sinhabitants have accelerated the onset of the next ice age through  theburning  of fossil fuels and the deforestation of large forested  areaslike  the Amazon. Hammaker says the only way to stop the glaciers  fromknocking  down  our back doors within this generation or the next,  is  toreduce  our  dependence on fossil fuels, reforest the  cities  and  thecountryside by replanting and remineralizing the earth through  rockdust   applications.   While   Hammaker   advocates   going   out   andremineralizing  all forests and fields, the average  homeowner  usuallydoes not have the time to take on such a large task. However, by simplytaking  care  of  one's  yard  and garden through  natural  means,  thecumulative effects will yield significant results on a global scale. About Rock Dust     The  amount of minerals and the quality rock used to produce  rockdust  depends  on  the location of the quarry, and the mining  process.Many  companies  sell rock dust, but it is best to inquire  about  whatminerals  it  contains and if there are any chemicals added.  If  theirmanufacturing  plant  is  nearby, ask to take a  tour.  Some  companiessimply  sell  the  dust  that  is left over  from  manufacturing  otherproducts.  This  may  not have the necessary minerals  for  plants  andtrees,  so it is best to buy rock dust from those companies which  makeit  specifically  for this use. They will be happy  to  provide  a  labreport for you.     Rock dust is usually high in calcium, iron, magnesium, sulfur, andmore  than  100 other trace minerals. The PH level is often  very  high(eight  or nine) and therefore must be used in small amounts,  combinedwith  compost, with peat moss if acid soil is required, or made into  aliquid form. The rock dust does not dissolve when mixed with water, butforms  a  colloid, making it instantly available to the  plants  it  issprayed  on.  Rock dust can replace many other  natural  mineralproducts which are harder to get and more expensive. The Bacteria Eat First     Not all the food that you add to your soil makes it to the plants.Initially, it must be broken down by soil microbes. The microbes livein  many  different areas of the soil, some live on the root  hairs  ofmany plants, some live only deep in the ground. The bacteria which live on theroot  hairs  of  plants convert minerals found  in  the  soil  into  adifferent  form of the same mineral which is available to  the  plants.Microbes  tear  apart or combine minerals. Also when the  microbes  diethey leave behind minerals in a changed form which is also available tothe plants as food. Mix The Dust     For  best  results mix different sources of rock dust together  toget more complete trace minerals. There are many companies now offeringrock  dust. We have listed as many of them as possible in our  ResourceDirectory. (coming soon) Making your own Rock Dust     While  this is not the easiest way, it can be done. Obtain a fiftygallon  steel drum, weld bicycle gears at both ends. Hook up a  bicyclethrough the chain gears. Set up the front wheel on a non-moveable base.Get  a  large round river stone to place inside. Make an opening  whichcan be closed and locked. Then place local rocks into drum and exercisewhile crushing the rocks! Most soft rocks will work well. You can  alsocrush  lobster  tails, clams, and other seafood materials.  Add  oystershells to increase calcium.

You can protect your roses from thrips, aphids and other pestattacks thru several different methods: Planting garlic at base of rosewill  deter pest attacks. Society garlic is also very effective.  Youcan  also make a garlic oil spray.  Purchase garlic oil from your  localgrocery store. If they don't have garlic oil, buy garlic butter.  Add  1tablespoon to a quart water sprayer. Make sure to strain before pouringinto sprayer to prevent  clogging.  Another  method you can use to control pests on your roses  is  tobury tobacco around the base of your roses. For best results take 1 cupdried  tobacco (use only organically grown tobacco if possible),  �  cupgarlic powder and mix into this 1 cup compost.  Bury at base of rose  byturning over into the soil.  A better method and one which I prefer, isto  get  a  small clay drain pipe (opened at both ends, about  3  incheswide,  12  inches long (smaller for roses, larger for trees) and  burythat at the base of the rose bush or plant, level with the ground. Intothis  place the mixture TGC+�(equal amounts of organic tobacco,  garlicpowder, compost and the + stands for trace minerals such as rock dust).Use  1 lb per unit. On top of this place either a pretty rock or a niceclay  pot to cover it, or simply mulch over, remembering where  it  is.This mixture should be replaced once per year or as often as needed.  You  can  also  use pebbles as a mulch to cover it, just  rememberwhere it is. For this rose vent to be effective, there should be a driphead  (2 gallons per hour) to allow water to pass thru it. The TGC+ willbe  absorbed  by  the  rose, Ficus etc, and it will  kill  the  thrips,aphids,  etc., as they attack the rose leaves (anything that eats  theseleaves will die!). Tobacco and garlic are both absorbed into the plant,anything that attacks the plant will also get this mixture. The tobaccowill kill any insect that attacks it. The Tobacco is very volatile  andwill biodegrade within 24 hrs if in liquid form; will last longer if itis  in a dust or in its natural leaf state.  Do not use tobacco on fruittrees. The garlic will change the taste of the plant confusing the bug. Tabasco Soap?     Another  spray formula to use to control thrips, aphids  and  mostpests:  add 1 tablespoon tabasco sauce, 1 tablespoon natural soap  suchas Dr. Bronners Peppermint Soap to a quart water spray bottle. This canbe sprayed onto the leaves and around base of plants. It will repel andkill thrips, aphids, etc. You can alternatively add 1 tablespoon gardengrade DE. DE     Diatomaceous  Earth  is a natural dust used  to  control  crawlinginsects, beetles, ants, aphids, spiders, snails, etc. DE can be used inmany  ways.  Can be added to water, strained and then sprayed.  Use  10tablespoons per gallon filtered water. DE can be made into a paste  andthen  painted  around  the base of the roses to  prevent  caterpillars,snails,  etc., from climbing up to eat the flowers. When using DE,  youmust  be  careful  to  avoid breathing  or  eye  contact,  due  to  itsabrasiveness.  Garden  grade  DE is perfectly  safe (pool  grade  DE  isdangerous)  to  use but it is a dust and should be handled  with  care.Wear a face mask when using and wash with water if it gets in your eye.Don't  rub  your  eyes,  remember DE is like thousands  of  tiny  razorblades.  Water will wash it away.For more information on DE see index. Controlling Aphids and Ants on Roses  The  other day I had a caller on my radio show.  She had  heard  myprevious  remarks  to  a caller concerning ants and  aphids  and  theirrelationship. This caller was certain that only some aphids are  herdedby  ants  and that most fly from place to place totally indifferent  towhat  the ants have to say about it.  It is just the opposite; mostaphids  are  under the control of their ant masters. I also have  foundit  to  be  true  that by controlling the ants, you  obtain  a  greatercontrol of the aphids which are attacking your roses, etc. There  is  adefinite  relationship between various insects, in  particular  aphids,which  are found on plants, and ants. The ants control most if not  allinsect activity on plants which they have 'adopted'.    Plants  under the care of the ants are protected by them  and  arealso used as a source of food either for them directly thru the sap  orpollen  of  the  plant or indirectly thru the use of aphids  and  otherinsects  which attack the plant and which in turn are `milked'  by  theants  (for their nectar). Changing the behavior of the ants is  a  veryimportant  factor in controlling many pests in the home and  garden  aswell as controlling the ants themselves.  This is developing a line  ofcommunication  between  the  ants  and  yourself.  Ants  are   uniquelypositioned  in  the  insect kingdom.  They are  intelligent  enough  toremember.  Ant memory works in a very direct way. They are  programmedby  nature to behave in a certain way.  Their actions are controlled  bycertain  factors  in their environment. Control these factors  and  youcontrol the ants.  Quiet Control is what you seek.  It is not neccessaryto  kill  them. For more information on ants see chapter  "Dances  withAnts". Getting A Hold     Raise  the energy level of the soil; in turn you will have  higherenergy  levels of the rose, vegetable or plant. The higher  the  energylevel  of the soil, the healthier the rose, the less stressed and   theless  pests  your  roses  will have attacking  them.  Ants  respond  toimbalance and stress. Give Caesar his Due     Feeding  the  ants will reduce their activity in  other  parts  oftheir kingdom (our yard and house). Ants, like most creatures except man,follow  the  path of least resistance.  Ants are good  at  this.  If  anendless food source has been found, they will use it to the benefit  oftheir colony. Ants will not have to go looking for food as long as theyget what they need. The basic idea is to provide for the ants a feedingcenter,  see Ant Cafes�chapter one. Set up at least one Ant  Cafe  nearby.  By  providing them a food source, we can begin to retrain them  tocome  for food here and to stop looking for food in the kitchen, or  onthe  roses,  etc..  This is a simple system that can become  your  mosteffective control method against the ants. Using  Natural Barriers to keep Ants/Aphids off     Tanglefoot  works  well for this. You can add  cayenne  pepper  toincrease its effectiveness. Other barriers to keep ants  and aphids offare  Tabasco sauce  and a natural soap sprayed on base and  on  leaves.Use  1  tablespoon of ea in 1 quart water. A good soap to  use  is  Dr.Bronners Peppermint soap which is available at most health food stores.Any natural soap which has a strong fragrance will work, Peppermint  isvery  effective for this purpose.    There are many natural  fungicidesthat are used to control Downey Mildew, Rust, BlackSpot, Powdery Mildewand  other exotic diseases,but by now you should get the idea that  thebasis  for  regaining the health of the roses and other  plants  is  toregain the health of the soil.  The an important word here is "Exotic".This is very important to understand. "Exotic" diseases can be directlycorrelated  to the lack of "Exotic" trace minerals. Usually  it  is  anabsence  of,  rather  than the presence of these exotic  minerals,  thattriggers  the  effect (which is the disease). This  is  also  true  forcommon diseases. To regain control of any such disease, you must regain the balanceof  the  eco-system that the plant is growing in. Check soil PH levels,Check  for  excessive salt levels such as boron, chlorine,  etc.  Checkwatering  habits and equipment. Use a garden filter to filter  out  thechlorine.  Check your composting/fertilizer habits, Switch over  slowlyto organics.  See more info on Dances with Ants chapter. Vit C?  Vit  C  is an effective way of controlling aphids on your roses.Use  a liquid vit c and spray several times per week or as needed.  Useabout 1,000 units per quart of water.
