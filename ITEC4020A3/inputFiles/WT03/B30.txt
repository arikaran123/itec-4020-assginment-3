NEW AND INTERESTING U.S. PATENTS (558 words) CopyrightTHE CHEMICAL MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1996BIGGER MAY NOT BE BETTERThe general condition of the U.S. chemical industry in 1995 showsa pattern of slight production growth, substantially increasingcorporate earnings growth and an equally consistent decline inemployment. This pattern shows certain corporate operatingprinciples that deserve critical judgement. These are as follows.     1) Profits will be higher if you pay fewer people.     2) A declining dollar can create a market without investment     in the human resource for process improvement and change.     3) It is possible to meet market demand without production and     process improvement by expanding older system and design     concepts. The steel industry is a historical precedent.     4) The investment in human capital can be forfeit now to be     recovered in the future at a lower price.The following reference expresses concern for the next year. Thedollar is gaining value and controls are being relaxed. There aremany  talented people in the marketplace. It should not be longbefore "mom and pop" operations can distribute rubbing alcohol tothe local pharmacies at half the price. Microbrewries are now acommonplace on the east coast. At a price they offer quality andchoice not available since before prohibition. Long Island now hasits own wine industry. It will soon recognize that its potato cropwould be useful for production and pipeline delivery of vodka to bedrunk in Manhattan and shipped world wide from the Port of NewYork. A right-of-way along the Long Island Railroad will do.Most of the processes operating in the chemical industry now canand will be copied and improved by the Chinese. Chemical productionis an ongoing process of growth based on improvement. There aremany aspects to improvement. Purity, safety, reliability, speed,applications of new materials and computer resources are examples.The present state of affairs is a one way ticket to obsolescence.**Storck, W.J., Chemical and Engineering News, Vol. 73, No. 50, pp.46-48, December 11, (1995)**Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CHEMICAL MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1996SILICON SENSORSFew materials can compare to silicon for its usefulness in sensordesign. The first commercial use of the material was in preparationof photosensors in 1960. In the last 35 years silicon has notchanged but there have been numerous changes in technology andmarket demand that increases its usefulness to the measurement andinstrumentation field.The following reference describes improvements and devices thatserve new demands. There are 10,000 researchers operating in 200laboratories that continue the study of silicon sensor devices.Recent improvement in technology makes controlled doping possible.It is now possible to make multiwavelength sensor that limitresponse as a function of the depth of penetration of thestimulated carriers.In addition there are demands that appear out of environmentalmonitoring needs and biosensing systems. Surface acoustic waves andmicrocalorimetric enzyme catalyst measuring systems are twoexamples of these applications.

Earlier work was limited to siliconoptical and pressure sensors. Now there are demonstrations of gaschromatography on a chip. These devices include valving, a flowchannel and a detector.There are various applications for these devices, but one of themore important is biological and biomedical sensing. Oneapplication is the monitoring of biological cells individually. Anexample is the observation in vitro of the responses of a cardiaccell under the influence of various chemicals.On the small scale of these sensors it is necessary to rethink thephysical properties of familiar materials. The surface tension ofwater can have a sealing action on a piston cylinder array.Chemical sensors based on these devices are currently in commercialdevelopment. Taguchi type sensors on micromachined silicon have anincreased level of versatility. The response time can be controlledby heaters designed into the system with a fast response andminimum power.**Leonard, M., Electronic Design, Vol. 43, No. 25, pp. 35-42,December 4, (1995)**Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CHEMICAL MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1996DIODE-BASED DETECTOR SPEEDS DNA ANALYSISAllen Northrup of Lawrence Livermore laboratories describes acompact assembly that performs the polymerase chain reaction. Thisreaction is important in cloning DNA to increase its concentrationfor more precise and more rapid detection. It is useful indetecting viruses, bacteria, mutations associated with cysticfibrosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).The unit is much smaller than the hardware presently available forthese measurements and promises to be an order of magnitudecheaper. It replaces a laser with a diode in the detectioncircuitry. It uses semiconductor fabrication techniques to preparethe thermal cycling process. This technology incorporates heatersand controllers in the silicon chambers. The small size and thermalmass permits rapid heating and cooling.The technology duplicates a process developed by Kary Mullis thatreceived the Nobel prize in 1993. Hardware available before thisdevelopment to process samples for cloning was between $7000 and$14,000, requiring hours of processing.

Mostreplacements now are the simpler, cheaper and lower voltage solidstate devices. Photomultipliers have not disappeared. They areparticularly well suited for high sensitivity at high energybecause they depend on charges transported in a vacuum. Theirapplication seems to be increasing. They are particularly usefulfor the detection of charged particles in space and on the ground.Cosmic ray detection is an example.Cosmic rays exist in showers that bombard the outer atmosphere.Some of them reach the surface. There is an active interest inmodelling these showers at various places on earth. These chargedspecies have significant influence on the chemistry of theatmosphere. An example is the loss of ozone at the poles.Photomultiplier tubes serve this need.There also is an interest in using photomultiplier tubes for thedetermination of muons and neutrinos under water. This revivedinterest by astronomers and physicists is driven by newapplications of an old detector. New designs include devices thatare about the size of a TO-5 can. They still require high voltage.**Messenger, H.W.

It uses the Internet as a sensor interfaceto measure multiple parameters such as flow and pressure. Thecomputers on line can bring generators on line when the waterlevels are high enough to drive them effectively. The systemcontains 85 fiber optic sensors embedded in the structure.Maintenance personnel monitor these sensors remotely to provideservice as required.This is a considerable economy over a system that requiresindividuals to be on site to record measurements as needed. Thesystem is useful for control functions and also informationgathering. Apart from the analog-digital boards that are part ofany instrument measuring system, the computer hardware is in everyway the same as other computer systems. It uses software that isavailable for the Apple or the PC system.There are the usual traffic delays that are part of the operationof Internet during periods of high usage.

There may be several answersto this question but one may be metallic electromigration betweenadjacent anodic and cathodic conductors on the board. Thephenomenon has been recognized since the 70s. It promises to becomea more important concern as multilayer boards find application.The electromigration phenomenon depends on voltage, humidity,contamination, distance between electrodes and temperature. Tocollect data rapidly observations are generally made at highvoltages, (typically 100 volts). The process occurs more slowly at10 volts.The following reference is part of a larger tutorial effort tofocus interest on failure processes. It provides documentedinformation on the factors that influence the processes involved inthe dendritic growth resulting from metallic electromigration.

"A number ofRepublicans like [New York Rep. Sherwood] Boehlert alreadyrecognize the depth of support for environmental controls,and they are trying to encourage the party to temper itsstand so it's not anti-environmental," said Doug MacMillan,executive director for the Environmental Technology Council."What they hear in their districts will make them recognizethe depth of public support for it." Superfund Reform '95Executive George Baker agreed that should GOP legislatorsfail to push through environmental reforms, especially toSuperfund, Republicans could "lose the political publicrelations war" and could be deemed anti-environment."They've allowed their opponents to forecast them as rollingback" environmental controls, he said.   EPA, meanwhile, must stand firm with its environmentalpolicies as Congress attempts to reduce agency staffing andbudget, MacMillan added. Since 1994, "EPA has reversedcourse on number of important environmental policies in anapparent attempt to placate some of its adversaries," hesaid. Along with making public statements supporting strictenvironmental standards, the agency must not backpeddle onits regulations. EPA cannot be "talking a good game, whilequietly surrendering to its opposition," he said.JOIN THE CLUB - EPA began preparing to shut down the federalSuperfund program Jan. 2. The agency is unable to pay nearly2,000 of its own employees in the program, and 8,000contractors who perform remediation work. Superfund was notaffected immediately by the federal shutdown because most ofthese employees are paid directly from the fund, rather thanfrom budget appropriations, said Jim Mathews, deputyassistant administrator for EPA's Office of Solid Waste andEmergency Response (HWN, Dec. 18, 1995, p. 399). ThoughCongress has not reauthorized the program nor issued itsallotment for the next fiscal year, Superfund has operatedsince October off a surplus in last year's fund, Mathewssaid. That money will run out Jan. 2, and the agency willbegin shutting down the program. Only emergency personnelwill continue working, reducing the agency's programemployees from more than 3,000 to only 80. Several largeSuperfund sites will continue cleanups during the shutdown,while many will cease operations, he said.

H.R. 2500, proposed by Rep. Michael Oxley (R-Ohio), andS. 1285, proposed by Sen. Robert Smith (R-N.H.), couldcreate an intense burden on state remediation programs, KrisHoellen, assistant deputy director for the Washington-basedAssociation of State and Territorial Solid Waste ManagementOfficials told the National Council of State Legislatures atthe council's annual meeting Dec. 14 in Washington. Underthese bills, litigation could increase from sites thatalready have selected a remedy if they find a more cost-effective method. State officials also fear the bills wouldcap the number of National Priorities List (NPL) sites,leaving states to fund many cleanups themselves.   Oxley's bill would pre-empt states from enacting cleanupstandards more stringent than federal levels, Hoellen said.Smith's bill, however, would allow states to pay thedifference for tougher standards, but it is unlikely stateswould not have the funds to enforce further site remediationbeyond federal standards, she said.   The House version of Superfund reform would cap the NPLat 125 sites over the next seven years, while 90 sites wouldbe allowed over three years on the Senate side. There noware 1,700 NPL-qualified sites EPA has yet to place on thelist, Hoellen said. Shifting these sites to state authoritycould overwhelm state agencies, she added.   Pre-enforcement litigation would greatly hinder sitecleanups, Hoellen told HWN. Both bills would allow partiesto reopen remedy cases if they show they can save at least$1 million using another method. In addition, the Senateversion of the bill would shift more program costs to thestates, compared with cost-sharing provisions in Oxley'sbill, she said.   Many states also do not want to pay for orphan shares,Hoellen said. Particularly, states do not want largepotentially responsible parties cashed out of liability,which could leave state agencies "holding the bag," shesaid.   If either bill passes in its present form, all new workon existing sites will stop, said Ed Putnam, associatedirector of remediation planning and design for the NewJersey Department of Environmental Protection. New Jerseycould only continue ongoing work, he said. Superfund wouldcontinue to fund immediate contamination removal programs,but states could not afford to take additional remedialaction, he added.   "There always has been competition for funds among stateregulatory agencies," Putnam said. "There's simply going tobe more competition" if Congress reforms Superfund.   Remediators would not be able to remove contaminated soilfrom some sites, preferring to close off the area, he said.Furthermore, states would not clean aquifers, preferring tomonitor plumes and treat contaminated wells, Putnam said.   Putnam finds no significant difference for states betweenthe bills. Both make the pursuit of funding competitivebetween states. "It's just a question of how competitive,"he said.Reauthorization Still Up in the Air   A more pressing question for states is the future ofSuperfund, which lacks a reauthorization bill and its taxingauthority, Putnam said. "Superfund is stalled; there is nonew work occurring," he said. Faced with the possibility ofsignificant changes in the law possibly months away and adwindling funding mechanism, it is difficult for states tomake any long-term plans for Superfund remediation, Putnamsaid.   Spending money and manpower to maintain retroactiveliability costs more than it would to repeal it, said acommercial consultant who deals in government affairs.   If the remedy process is not reformed, states could notafford remediation, the consultant told HWN. There are manystate agencies who are competent enough to handle cleanupsmore efficiently than EPA can, he said. "There are a numberof states embarrassed by EPA's performance" in Superfundcleanups, he added.   States do not spend nearly as much money on cleanups asEPA, the consultant said. Particularly, states historicallydo not take as long to select a remedy or to completecleanups.   Though EPA is blaming the Republican Congress forstalling the Superfund program, the consultant criticizedPresident Clinton, who vetoed the recent Veteran'sAdministration/Department of Housing and Urban Developmentbill last month that would have extended Superfund taxes. Inaddition, EPA has been dragging its feet in assisting with acompromise Superfund reauthorization bill, he added. "EPAhas been working overtime to stop the bill," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightHAZARDOUS WASTE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996SUPERFUND REFORM BILLS TOP THE LISTOF KEY CONCERNS FOR UPCOMING YEAR   Congressional action on Republican Superfund reforms thisyear could significantly alter the course of how hazardouswaste is managed, affecting many aspects ranging fromimpending rulemaking to technology, according to severalindustry analysts.   Superfund reform, a priority on the Republican agenda, isexpected to be the key issue in the industry in 1996. ManyDemocrats have criticized the reform efforts so far, but GOPmembers likely will collaborate more this year with theircolleagues across the aisle to approve a reform package,said George Baker, executive director of Superfund Reform'95. The debate should move rapidly because 1996 is anelection year, and most work will be completed by August togear up for elections in the fall, he said.   Republicans "need Democrats to be comfortable with [thereforms], and get broad support from industry, smallbusinesses and municipalities," Baker said. "These reformsare needed to effectively clean up a number of sitesfaster." Once a reform package is adopted, Superfundreauthorization should proceed smoothly, he added.   Congressional delays on Superfund reform last yearfrustrated members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association(CMA). As the debate drags on, the association is concernedthat legislators will tinker with proposed bills further,allowing more exemptions. "We're getting to the point wheredeals will be made here and there," said CMA spokesman MattWeinstock. "As long as it floats around, there are morechances for industry to make carveouts. Congress needs toget this thing done without creating a new unfair system."   CMA also urges Congress to pass H.R. 2036. The bill wouldstreamline land disposal restrictions under the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (see story, this page)."The bill will make management of waste fairer and easier tocomply," Weinstock said, praising the bipartisan effort toapprove the bill. "If we could have had that effort onSuperfund, we'd be done."   EPA's Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR),scheduled for promulgation late this year, also may impacthazardous waste management (HWN, Dec. 4, 1995, p. 384).However, Title 9 of H.R. 2500, Rep. Michael Oxley's (R-Ohio)Superfund reform bill, could render HWIR moot. Officialswith the Environmental Technology Council (ETC) oppose thisportion of the bill because it would allow states to adoptprovisions freeing the management of remediation waste fromRCRA's Subtitle C requirements or the Toxic SubstanceControl Act.   "We believe some modified national standards for hotspots makes sense for Superfund and RCRA waste," said ETCExecutive Director Doug MacMillan. "If the bill passes,there will be no purpose to go forward with the [HWIR]contaminated media rule" to be proposed soon.   Superfund reforms also could severely hamper marketinginnovative technologies for hazardous waste this year. Billsin the House and Senate largely favor closing off ahazardous site rather than seeking permanent remediation,MacMillan said. "That will be a serious disincentive forinnovative site cleanup technology," he said. "Why worryabout detoxifying waste if you can fence a site off orprovide alternatives to water supply?"   EPA anticipates proposing its hazardous waste combustionstrategy this year, which has been a bone of contention inrecent years between hazardous waste incinerators and cementkilns. The agency is slated to propose emission standardsfor cement kilns and to determine proper handling of cementkiln dust. "If EPA could get some realistic, applicablestandards for air emissions and for combustion residues, thelong-running controversies would die down," MacMillan said."That would be positive because the arguments between thevarious groups have eroded the general public's confidenceabout combustion."Back to Headline List CopyrightHAZARDOUS WASTE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996LAND DISPOSAL RESTRICTIONSH.R. 2036 APPROVED IN COMMITTEE;BILL REQUIRES REPORT ON RELEASES   EPA next year may ask particular landfills and treatmentsystems accepting treated hazardous waste to provide datafor a five-year study on the threat of the sites' wastestream to human health and the environment.   The House Commerce Committee Dec. 21 passed H.R. 2036,the Land Disposal Flexibility Act, with relatively minoramendments. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Michael Oxley (R-Ohio), passed the committee's Commerce, Trade and HazardousMaterials Subcommittee in November (HWN, Dec. 11, 1995, p.394).   The measure would allow EPA to set land disposalstandards now prohibited by a federal court decision. Theagency in 1990 exempted from Resource Conservation andRecovery Act (RCRA) standards treated hazardous waste attreatment systems regulated under the Clean Water Act andnonhazardous deep injection wells regulated under the CleanDrinking Water Act. In 1992, however, the Washington, D.C.,District Court directed EPA to apply RCRA standards to thesewastes, which some industry officials said adds up to $800million annually in compliance costs.   Democrats worked extensively with Republican committeemembers to pass the bill to the House floor, with Rep.Blanche Lambert Lincoln (D-Ark.) working with Oxley toaddress many Democratic concerns. The committee passed anamendment offered by Lincoln calling for EPA to completewithin five years a study on these sites to determine ifreleases are threatening the ground water or human health.Ranking Democrat Rep. John Dingell (Mich.) warned thatsetting a deadline on the study could lead to further courtaction, yet did not oppose Lincoln's amendment.   Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) expressed the strongestopposition to the bill, calling for an EPA study completedwithin three years, whereupon the agency must take action onthe study's findings. Wastewaters from these sites can haveconcentrations of toxins up to 99 times drinking waterstandards, thereby necessitating quick action on these riskreports, he said. "Decharacterized waste containinghazardous constituents may leak from surface impoundments atthe same levels of concerns as listed waste streams,"Pallone said.   Several members opposed the amendment, saying it wouldrequire EPA to depend on old data to meet the three-yeardeadline, and would force the agency to spend more time andresources on waste that does not cause a significant threatto the environment. Committee members sought to push thebill through Congress before Jan. 17, the court-issueddeadline for the EPA rules to take affect.

ASME analyzed more than 1,900 test results of hazardous,solid, biomass and medical waste combustors. Limiting thechlorine content of combustor feedstocks has little or noeffect on the composition or quantity of dioxin emitted,states the report, The Relationship Between Chlorine inWaste Streams and Dioxin Emissions from Waste CombustorStacks.   HMCs studied in the report include hazardous wasteincinerators (HWIs), fired boilers and cement kilns. Theconcentration of chlorine in the feed stocks for thegenerators ranges from less than 0.1 percent for manybiomass combustors up to 80 percent for some HWIs, the studysays. The tests were done at 169 facilities - including 74hazardous waste combustors - where chlorine and PCDD/Femissions were measured.   PCDD/F and chlorine were "simultaneously characterized"at 107 units in 90 facilities. The data was checked toidentify errors and statistical problems, standardized toreflect common reference conditions and analyzed todetermine if either the composition of PCDD/F concentrationsor the quantity of those composition changed, ASME states inthe report.   Tests in 72 waste facilities showed no significantrelationship between chlorine input and PCDD/F measured inthe gas streams. In many of the tests, the combustion unitswere "spiked" with larger amounts of chlorinated plastics,or polyvinyl chloride, to determine if a higher chlorinecontent in the waste fuel produced any measure of dioxin,ASME explains. Cement kilns "displayed no apparent stack gasPCDD/F concentration increase with increasing chlorine feedrate," the report states. The result "is not surprising,since chlorine is frequently added to remove natural alkalisand produce Portland cement meeting federal and stateconstruction standards," ASME says.   The study was not intended to evaluate control systemsperformance, generate new data, assess the relationshipbetween PCDD/F and chlorine in liquid effluents or solidresidues, or to evaluate the removal of particulate-boundPCDD/F in emission control devices, ASME says.   "The failure to find simultaneous increases in mostcases, and finding a few inverse relationships, indicatesthat whatever effect feed chlorine has on PCDD/Fconcentrations in flue gases, it is smaller than theinfluence of other causative factors," the society states inthe report. "Any effect chlorine has on PCDD/Fconcentrations in commercial scale systems is a factor ofair pollution control system temperature, ash chemistry,combustion conditions, imprecise measurement and localizedflow stratification."

The Occidental Chemical Corp. Dec. 21 agreed to pay $129million over four years to EPA and the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency (FEMA) to cover cleanup costs at the LoveCanal site. Under the settlement, EPA will receive $102million, and FEMA, which relocated area residents and begansite cleanup, will get $27 million.   Occidental's corporate predecessor, Hooker Chemicals &Plastics Corp., buried more than 20,000 tons of chemicalwaste from 1942 to 1953. Although a housing developmentlater was built on the site, hundreds of families wereforced to leave these homes in the late 1970s to allow crewsto remediate the site. The site's cleanup costs eventuallylead to the creation of Superfund in 1980.   In addition, New York originally sought $630 million indamages from Occidental, but the company in 1994 agreed topay the state $98 million. Occidental's suits with the cityof Niagara Falls and several former residents still arepending.   "This reaffirms the definite need to move on legislativereforms so we don't have these cases hanging around for 11or 12 years," said Chemical Manufacturers Associationspokesman Matt Weinstock, who doubts the settlement willspark other large Superfund payback agreements. "I'd like tothink things will continue on a case-by-case basis."   A key EPA official agreed the Superfund program needsgenuine reform, yet not as stringent as Republican billsproposed in Congress. "We need to speed cleanups and lowercosts so that more property can be returned to communitiesfor productive use," said EPA Region 2 Administrator JeanneFox. "The lessons learned at Love Canal have beensuccessfully applied at hundreds of abandoned waste sitesaround the country, where toxic threats to public healthhave been removed."   Claims in GOP reform bills stating 40 percent of taxpayerfunding for Superfund goes to litigation are untrue, Foxsaid. "That figure refers to the legal costs to privateparties involved in suits and countersuits, often with theirinsurance companies," she added.

EPA Nov. 15 granted S.D. Myers, an Ohio-based hazardouswaste treatment firm, a special exemption to import PCBs fortreatment at the firm's Talmadge, Ohio, plant. The next day,Sheila Copps, Canada's environment minister, issued aninterim ban on the company's exportation of the carcinogenicchemicals, said Dana Myers, president of S.D. Myers.   The Environment Ministry bowed to pressure from theCanadian hazardous waste treatment industry, particularlyChem-Security, a large Edmonton, Alberta-based firm, Myerssaid. Officials from Chem-Security could not be reached forcomment. Prior to the ban, the Canadian government grantedMyers permission to import PCBs with EPA's approval."Environment Canada asked EPA to open the borders" to PCBs,Myers said. "After EPA did, Canada slammed them shut."   After the Environment Ministry issued the interim ban,two Canadian firms, General Waste Transport Inc. and theQuebec Center for the Environment, sued the EnvironmentMinistry Dec. 19 to lift the ban. The Environment Ministryissued the ban under the Canadian Environmental ProtectionAct. Copps implemented an interim ban from one rule andapplied it to a different rule, which invalidates the ban,Myers told HWN.   The companies are bringing Copps and Canadian AttorneyGeneral Allan Rock to court on two separate grounds. First,Copps did not have the authority to enact the ban becausehuman health is not threatened with the transport of PCBsacross national borders, said Douglas Hamilton, a partner inthe Toronto firm of Osler & Hoskin, and the attorneyrepresenting General Waste Transport. The ban also wouldretain Chem-Security's monopoly of the Canadian PCBremediation market, thus invalidating the ban, Myers added.The firms are reviewing Environment Ministry procedures inimplementing the ban to determine if it had the necessarybacking of the Ministry of Health, Hamilton said.Environment Ministry officials could not be reached forcomment.

The paper, presented recently at the annual WaterEnvironment Federation conference, outlines how theconsulting firm negotiated with the Pennsylvania Departmentof Environmental Resources (DER) to set less-stringentWQBELs for a client. The new limits should be less costlythan a draft National Pollution Discharge Elimination System(NPDES) permit DER originally prepared for an electroniccomponents manufacturer, states Hall's study, NegotiatingLess Conservative Water Based Effluent Limits: A Case Study.   The draft included WQBELs for copper and lead, as well asfluoride limits based on historical performance. Afterstudying the draft limits, ERM concluded these limits weretoo conservative, and the company would struggle to complywith them, the report states.   The manufacturer discharged 330,000 gallons per day ofprocess wastewater into a large fresh water river. Theproposed fluoride limits included average monthly limits,maximum daily limits and instantaneous maximum concentrationlimits. A review of historical data of effluent dischargeshowed the facility could not comply with the state'saverage monthly limit, the study said.   The WQBELs for copper and lead affected four dischargestreams in the facility - three process wastewaterdischarges and a cooling water discharge. Studies showed theplant's wastewater treatment operations, with improvements,could easily handle the limits set for lead. However, thecompany determined the draft copper limits were three timeslower than the best treatment technology could provide, thestudy says.   The low draft limits stemmed partially frommisconceptions about mineral hardness, or concentration, inthe river. ERM recorded the river's hardness data per month.River hardness peaked during the late summer and early fall,which coincided with low effluent flow from the plant, ERMconcluded. DER, therefore, raised the WQBEL for copper inthe permit.   Moreover, ERM determined the slope of the receivingriver, or the difference in elevation between two pointsalong the river, was less steep where effluent enters thanat other sections along the river. A mild slope gives theeffluent less time to travel downstream and a greater chanceto disperse in a smaller area, the report says.   DER has since raised the WQBEL for copper from 0.18milligrams per liter (mg/l) to 0.47 mg/l. DER also raisedthe lead limit from 0.29 mg/l to 0.43 mg/l, thereby removinglead as a water quality-based parameter. DER also raised thecompany's average monthly limit for fluoride 2.5 times thenormal limit, the study says.   "What this case study clearly illustrates is that aregulatory authority is not responsible for establishingoptimum parameters value to maximize effluent limits whiletrying to protect the environment," the report says. "Thatresponsibility lies with the permittee."

A Clinton administration proposalto combine the Department of Transportation's 10 agenciesinto three modal offices apparently got lost in thelegislative shuffle last year.RSPA Clarifications     Selective testing: Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee,asked whether alternative closure methods for packages maybe used interchangeably without retesting, so long as thepackages provide an equivalent level of performance.     RSPA responded that under the agency's SelectiveTesting Variation 4 [Section 178.601(g)(ii) of the HazardousMaterials Regulations], testing is not required when thestructural design of the tested-out packaging, includingmethods of closure, "is maintained." The agency added,"Thus, any change to the originally tested closure resultsin a different packaging design type requiring designqualification testing."     Competent authority: The Glidden Co., Cleveland, askedwhether it would need a Competent Authority Permit Numberfrom the U.S. Transportation Department, and display thatnumber on all shipping papers, to export a product in RSPA-approved UN1A2 (open-head) drums. The International MaritimeDangerous Goods (IMDG) Code generally requires shipments tobe made in steel, closed-head drums unless another type ofdrum is permitted under competent authority.     RSPA responded that so long as the U.S. companycomplies with the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) ithas permission from competent authority and does not needother documentation. "The RSPA associate administrator forhazardous materials safety is the United States CompetentAuthority for purposes of the IMDG Code," RSPA said. "Theprovisions contained in the HMR constitute competentauthority approval for the United States for transportationof hazardous materials in instances where the IMDG code ...specifically permit[s] a variation based on the approval ofcompetent authority."     Reportable quantity: The Technical Group Inc.,Washington, asked whether it is better to rely on theintended formulation "batch sheet" information or on theactual laboratory analysis of the end product to determinewhether the lead content of a material meets or exceeds itsassigned reportable quantity of 10 pounds per package.     RSPA said it is the shipper's duty to classify a hazmatproperly, and the agency "does not prescribe a particularmethod a shipper must follow in determining whether amaterial is a hazardous substance." Added RSPA: "If anyconstituent equals or exceeds its listed RQ per package,then the material meets the definition of a hazardoussubstance. Therefore, if the amount of lead content in amaterial equals or exceeds 10 pounds per package, thematerial is a hazardous substance."     Unflanged heads: New Progress Inc., Arthur, Ill., askedwhether Department of Transportation (DOT) regulationspermit cargo tanks with unflanged heads to be used totransport hazmat. New Progress said if DOT rules allow, thecompany would proceed with building chassis-mounted trucktanks with unflanged heads.     RSPA had bad news for the company: DOT regulationsprohibit the use of tanks with unflanged heads. "Unflangedheads have no radius and are unacceptable," RSPA said."Flanged heads having a knuckle radius less than thatpermitted by Section 178.346-1(d)(3) [of the HazardousMaterials Regulations] also are not acceptable."     Made in the USA: Olympic IBC Corp, Kirkland, Wash.,asked whether it may apply the "USA" mark to bulk containersthe company primarily manufactures at its affiliate inMexico. Because it takes full responsibility for themarkings and the final step of manufacture is completed inthe United States, Olympic IBC said it believes thecontainers may be marked USA.     However, the company is wrong, RSPA said. Under theagency's HM-215A rule, RSPA said, "A USA marked packagingshould be manufactured and marked only in the U.S." The ruleis published in the Dec. 29, 1994, Federal Register.     Shipping, fueling: Consolidated Edison Company of NewYork Inc., New York, asked whether the Hazardous MaterialsRegulations, which apply to cylinders used as shippingcontainers, apply to cylinders used as part of a system tofuel a compressed natural gas-powered vehicle.     "Cylinders used as fuel tanks for propulsion and not totransport cargo are not subject to regulation under thefederal hazardous materials transportation law or theHazardous Materials Regulations," RSPA responded.     "In addition, as long as those cylinders are mounted onyour vehicles and used only as fuel tanks, there is no legalrequirement to reinspect or retest them under theexemption," the agency stated. "Therefore, you may make yourown determinations about what reinspections and retests arenecessary for safety purposes."Back to Headline List CopyrightHAZMAT TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996RSPA IMPROPERLY CEDES AUTHORITYUNDER TICKET PROPOSAL, NPCA SAYS     The Research and Special Programs Administration, in aproposal to ticket hazmat violations that do notsubstantially harm safety, improperly surrenders much of itshazmat oversight responsibility to the U.S. Coast Guard, agroup of paint-makers, suppliers and distributors has toldRSPA.     The National Paint and Coatings Association (NPCA) alsoderided the proposal as ambiguous and a way to discouragecompanies from paying fines, even as the group  praised RSPAfor trying to simplify hazmat enforcement procedures.Nevertheless, the focus of the association's objections isRSPA's proposal to have Coast Guard hearing officers handleshippers' appeals of these tickets.     Under the controversial proposal, RSPA inspectors wouldbe allowed to write tickets for violations that have "nosubstantial impact on safety," including: operating under anexpired exemption, neglecting to register, failing tomaintain training records and not filing incident reports.The tickets would state the facts supporting the allegedviolation and a penalty amount "substantially less than thepenalty that would be proposed under current procedures,"RSPA stated.Coast Guard Would Hear Cases     Other provisions of RSPA's proposal would give allegedviolators the choice of paying the ticket or contesting theproposed penalty within 30 days of receipt. Companiescontesting the ticket would have a hearing before a U.S.Coast Guard hearing officer, a proposal NPCA derided asunfair to industry.     "Final resolution of alleged violations by the CoastGuard, without any recourse back to RSPA, is troublingbecause the industry is not familiar with Coast Guardprocedures and the industry is unsure of the Coast Guard'sfamiliarity with RSPA regulations and the practice of themotor transportation industry," NPCA said.     "Although the Coast Guard may have some expertise withhazardous materials regulations as they relate to maritimeshipping, the Coast Guard has no history of interaction withmotor carriers," the group added. "Therefore, they are notfamiliar with the general practices of the industry and thisfact will be an obstacle to a smooth resolution of thesecases."     NPCA urged RSPA to increase its own role in theproposal by giving alleged violators a right to appeal theCoast Guard's decision to the RSPA administrator. After all,RSPA would be the agency that enforces the Coast Guard'sruling, the association added.     "RSPA's desire to offload some of the burden ofhandling 'insubstantial' violations through a ticketingprogram...to better service cases or violations that doconcern safety issues is laudable," NPCA said. "However,even in cases where there is no substantial impact onsafety, there may come a time during the resolution processthat the enforcing agency's office needs to examine thecase."     In addition to its objection regarding the CoastGuard's role, NPCA said RSPA has failed to define adequatelywhat the agency means by "no substantial impact" on safety."Although it does seem clear that the ticketing option willonly be used for the seemingly innocuous recordkeeping typeof violations, there is no built-in mechanism within theproposal that clearly establishes succinct boundaries forinclusion in the program," NPCA said.Proposal Would Discourage Payment     RSPA's proposal to permit minor violations to countagainst a shipper's safety record, and thereby increase thecompany's penalties for future violations, will discouragethe payment of fines. Companies, instead of paying the finesimmediately, would try their luck at a hearing, therebydelaying payments, the association added.     "If the ticketing proposal is meant to be a streamlinedmethod of dealing with 'insubstantial' violations and willresult in a certain percentage of cases being moved awayfrom RSPA, RSPA will want to encourage companies toparticipate in this new streamlined process," NPCA said.     "If, however, companies learn that the most innocuous'insubstantial' violations will result in escalating finesor other ramifications (like an increase in insurancepremiums because of a number of tickets, being published inthe year-end report of violations with a list of tickets),there will be no incentive to pay the ticket," NPCA added."Faced with escalating fines or other ramifications, mostcompanies will choose to contest the ticket."

Under NAFTA, Mexican and U.S. truckers were to beallowed to cross the border and operate throughout thoseU.S. and Mexican states along the border starting Dec. 18.     Mexican drivers wanting to operate past the up-to-15-mile commercial zone must file for approval from theInterstate Commerce Commission's successor agency. Thoughthat agency, the Surface Transportation Board, will takeapplications from Mexican truckers, approval will bewithheld until safety meetings occur, Pe$a said.Mexico: Move Violates NAFTA     Since the announcement, the Mexican government wrote toU.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor declaring the U.S.delay a violation of the principles of the agreement andthreatening to file a complaint under NAFTA's enforcementmechanism. U.S. officials expressed surprise about theMexican complaints, saying the Mexican government knew ofthe U.S. intent far in advance.     And, said Kantor in a return letter excerpted in TheWashington Post, despite the Mexicans' concerns, "we mustfirst and foremost ensure the safety and security of ourcitizens."     The trucking industry, cautiously concerned when Pe$afirst announced the delay, became "outraged" as the weekwent on, said Linda Bauer-Darr, vice president ofinternational relations at the American TruckingAssociations (ATA). "Obviously, there is no deadline" to endthe delay, Bauer-Darr said. "Obviously [the delay] wasbrought about because of political pressures.     "This is not a good way to be conducting business ...with our important trading partners," Bauer-Darr said.     As Dec. 18 approached, safety advocates such asCitizens for Reliable and Safe Highways (CRASH) and unionssuch as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters steppedup protests to the pending opening of the border.     The groups contend Mexican trucks do not meet state andfederal standards regarding safety, weight or insurance andthat Mexican drivers are not sufficiently trained in hazmatprocedures. They also contend state and federal officials inthe United States are not sufficiently staffed, funded orprepared to enforce U.S. safety standards on the Mexicantrucks. Officials in the four border states - Arizona,California, New Mexico and Texas - share those worries.     Giving in to pressure from those groups will hurt theU.S. trucking industry in the long run, Bauer-Darr said."This is going to play very dangerously when it comes toother pending trade issues with Mexico," she added.     U.S. and Mexican negotiators are trying to work outdisputes over such issues as small-package delivery, wheat-transportation rules and the use of 53-foot trailers inMexico.     "This delay destroys any political leverage [the UnitedStates] had at all," Bauer-Darr said. "Here we're sayingit's very important for [Mexico] to live up to its NAFTAcommitments, but then we don't live up to ours."     The labor and safety groups were "cautiouslyoptimistic" about the delay. "The delay is good news ...only if it means that Mexico will ultimately raise itstruck-safety standards to meet our own," said CRASHExecutive Director Jack Rendler. "Our government should bedoing more, not less, to address truck safety, and NAFTAshould not result in any loosening of U.S. truck-safetystandards.

Under the usual procedure, RSPA - like other federalagencies - proposes rules and invites the public to commenton the proposals. Only after the time for comments hasexpired does the agency issue its regulations.     However, in an effort to make the agency moreefficient, RSPA has proposed bypassing the notice-and-comment period by publishing "non-controversial" rules inthe Federal Register and then seeking input from parties whoobject to the rules. If RSPA does not receive a "significantadverse comment" or notice that a party intends to file anobjection by a certain date, the rule would go into effect.Agency Defines 'Non-Controversial'     In its proposed procedural change, RSPA defined non-controversial rules as those that effect minor, substantivechanges to regulations; incorporate by reference the latestedition of technical or industry standards; or extendcompliance dates.     The agency also defined significant adverse comment asa statement from an interested party that explains why therule is inappropriate, ineffective or unacceptable.     "Comments that are frivolous or insubstantial would notbe considered adverse under this procedure," RSPA said. "Acomment recommending a rule change in addition to the rulewould not be considered a significant adverse comment,unless the commenter states why the rule would beineffective without the additional change."     Parties wishing to comment on RSPA's proposed "direct-final-rule" procedure must do so by Feb. 16. For moreinformation, contact: Nancy Machado of RSPA's chief-counseloffice, (202) 366-4400.

Under the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), theDepartment of Energy (DOE) must begin accepting high-levelwaste from U.S. nuclear power plants by 1998. However, DOEis behind schedule in constructing a permanent storagefacility, slated for Yucca Mountain, Nevada.     Next month, the House may vote on legislation (H.R.1020) that would require DOE to open an interim storagefacility at Yucca Mountain. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.)introduced similar legislation (S. 167) in the Senate, butthat measure has stalled. Both bills call for the interimfacility to begin accepting waste by 1998, but severalissues must be resolved before the shipments can begin.O'Leary Cites Concerns     Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary Dec. 14 told the SenateEnergy and Natural Resources Committee the administrationcould not support proposals siting the interim facility atYucca Mountain until it finishes suitability studies on thepermanent repository. However, O'Leary said DOE couldcomplete its suitability determination by the end of 1998,and, if Yucca Mountain appears suitable, the agency mayconsider building an interim facility.     That day, Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) introduced a bill(S. 1478) to privatize interim storage, a proposal backed bynuclear-power interests in his home state. Grams' bill wouldlet a private consortium build and operate an interimstorage facility and allow DOE to contract with theconsortium for waste storage. The facility would be built ongovernment-owned land, probably in Nevada.     "For 16 years, DOE has been charged with theresponsibility of our civilian spent fuel," Grams said. "Inthat time, DOE has spent nearly $5 billion of ratepayers'money, including over $250 million from Minnesota's electriccustomers...Privatizing the interim storage program wouldimprove efficiency and lower costs to the taxpayers."     But most in the nuclear industry are pinning theirhopes on DOE building an interim facility. "It[privatization] would be a last resort," said Scott Petersof the Nuclear Energy Institute.RSPA Appeals ActionRSPA Ref. No. 90-82-SB. In the Matter of MortonInternational Inc., Respondent.Background     On Aug. 16, 1991, the Research and Special ProgramsAdministration (RSPA) fined Morton International $2,000 forhaving knowingly violated several sections of the HazardousMaterials Regulations (HMR). These provisions included 49CFR 171.2(a), 171.2(c), 172.202(a)(1), 172.202(a)(2), and173.102.     RSPA reduced to $2,000 a $3,500 fine the agencyproposed in an Aug. 23, 1990, Notice of Probable Violation.The company appealed the $2,000 fine.Discussion     Morton International conceded RSPA's finding that thecompany had violated HMR by failing to mark "DOT 12B" oneach side of the package. But the company contested RSPA'sother findings.     RSPA said the company was required to meet all mandatesof Exemption DOT E 8214 when offering hazmat for interstatetransportation pursuant to the exemption. Failing that, theshipments had to meet HMR mandates, the agency added.     RSPA charged Morton International with violating theHMR by failing to mark properly its otherwise complyingpackagings with the "12B" specification.     RSPA said Morton International knowingly offered hazmatfor transport in commerce in unauthorized, non-DOTspecification packaging, in violation of Exemption DOT E8214 and 49 CFR 171.2(a) and 173.102. The company said thehazmat was part of a shipment from Utah to California, whereit was awaiting transfer to Japan.     Morton International argued the International AirTransport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulationsgovern movement of the material to Japan and said theseregulations prohibit "double marking" of packages withUnited Nations (UN) markings and DOT markings. The companysaid this prohibition on dual UN and DOT markings barred itfrom placing the otherwise necessary "DOT 12B" markings onthe packages.     However, RSPA said the company was wrong in believingthat IATA regulations control movement of the packages andthat a prohibition exists on DOT markings on packagesoffered for international transportation. The InternationalCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructionsgovern international transport of hazmat and permit dualmarkings, RSPA added.     Even if dual markings were prohibited, MortonInternational's violations concern the offering of materialfor transportation from Utah to California; that is withinthe United States, RSPA said. If a prohibition on dualmarkings on international shipments did exist, the companywould still be required to mark the packages with therequisite DOT specification marking for interstate trans-portation within the United States and to make any necessarymodifications before offering the packages for internationaltransportation, RSPA added.     Because Morton International did not comply with theDOT exemption, it was required to comply with the HMR, andits violation lay in its failure to comply with the HMR,RSPA said. While it met the basic requirements of the "DOT12B" specification, the company failed to meet with the HMRbecause it did not mark the packages with the "12B"specification, RSPA said.Findings     "I find that a civil penalty of $1,500 is appropriatein light of the nature and circumstances of theseviolations, their extent and gravity, respondent'sculpability, respondent's lack of prior violations,respondent's ability to pay, the effect of a civil penaltyon respondent's ability to continue in business, and allother relevant factors," RSPA administrator D.K. Sharmasaid.Back to Headline List CopyrightHAZMAT TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996NTSB COUNTS HEAD SHIELDS, COUPLERSAS BEING AMONG ITS TOP ACHIEVEMENTS     The National Transportation Safety Board counts theNTSB-inspired requirement that railroad tank carstransporting hazmat be equipped with head shields and shelfcouplers as being among its greatest achievements.     In a recent report, NTSB said these safety featureshave dramatically reduced the number of tank-car explosionsand ruptures during the past 10 years. Nevertheless, NTSBwarned the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), railroadsand shippers to remain vigilant.     "The danger still exists, and accidents still occur,"NTSB wrote in its report We Are All Safer: NTSB Improvementsin Transportation Safety. The report detailed NTSB studieson freight-railroad accidents and resulting boardrecommendations the federal government or private sector hasadopted. These agency and corporate steps have enhancedtransportation safety, NTSB said.NTSB Praises Railroads     For example, NTSB praised the railroad industry forresponding to board suggestions by improving communicationwith communities near railyards and rail routes. Inaddition, FRA, the Association of American Railroads andlocomotive manufacturers have met to establish a program togather data on fuel-tank damage and fuel spills.     The board singled out CSX Transportation (CSXT) forspecial praise for its response to a 1989 derailment andbutane spill in Akron, Ohio. Based on NTSB recommendations,CSXT began training its railroad crews to assist emergencypersonnel responding to hazmat spills and to require crewsto keep up-to-date listings of where the hazmat-containingcars are on trains, the agency added.     NTSB also hailed the Chemical Manufacturers Associationfor requiring its members to have a chemical-risk managementprogram to evaluate risks of spills and implement ways toreduce the chances of hazmat leaks. CMA's actions followed a1981 NTSB study that found 2,121 railroad accidentsinvolving hazmat resulted in the evacuation of 100,000people.     In that study, the board also examined 45 railroadaccidents. "In at least 21 of the 45 cases investigated forthe study, the safety board found that local emergencyresponse incident commanders did not have a hazardous-materials emergency-response plan to follow, and in 19 ofthe cases, incident commanders and railroad personnel hadnot been in contact with each other to develop a plan ofaction in the event of a train accident involving hazardousmaterials," NTSB stated.

As director, he has overseen the design,construction, maintenance and operation of the county'sroads and its airport.

RSPA, which enforces HMR, concluded the federal rulestrump New York's after weighing the Chemical WasteTransportation Institute's (CWTI's) challenge to the stateregulation. In a petition to RSPA, CWTI said the New YorkCodes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) are not "substantivelythe same as" the federal regulations and are thereforeinvalid under the federal Hazardous Materials TransportationAct.     In its decision, RSPA agreed with CWTI's argument thatthe NYCRR goes beyond HMR by imposing an absoluteprohibition on repackaging hazardous waste. HMR, unlike theNew York rule, allows for some repackaging, such as theconsolidation of some loads from cargo tanks to tank cars,RSPA said.State Went Too Far     New York also went too far in requiring all hazardouswaste transfers to be listed on manifests, RSPA found.Federal rules require only that the transporter's companyname and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)identification number appear on the manifest.     Finally, RSPA objected to New York's requirement thathazmat be transferred between vehicles only in containerswith impervious bases and drainage and capacity limits. HMRcontains general requirements that the containers be impact-resistant for the minimum and maximum temperaturesencountered during transportation.     Before RSPA would consider its challenge to New York,CWTI had to survive a challenge from New York. The stateurged RSPA to ignore CWTI's petition, saying the grouplacked standing to oppose the state regulation because noneof its members has been hurt by the controversial rule.     New York, joined by Pennsylvania and Montana, said CWTIis primarily concerned with hazmat transportation, and thestate regulations in question concern toxins that are merelywaiting to be transported. CWTI countered that many of itsmembers have refused to engage in certain hazmat-relatedactivities in New York, lest they be fined heavily forrunning afoul of the state rules.     RSPA, ruling in favor of CWTI, said hazmat awaitingtransportation is still governed by the HMR provisionsgoverning shipments. The New York rules and HMR, therefore,affect CWTI members, allowing the group to challenge thestate regulations, RSPA said.     "Where loading, unloading or storage occurs incidentalto the movement of property in commerce, that activity iswithin the scope of federal law governing the transportationof hazardous material and the HMR," RSPA said. "Requirementsaffecting transportation facilities, and transporters'activities at those facilities, are subject to federalpreemption."

GABRIELESpurred by ongoing technical innovations, favorable cost comparisons withpaper and other resin systems, and growing end-use markets, high-densitypolyethylene blown film production will register strong annual growth ratesduring the next five years.   North America, Asia, and Latin America are identified as prime growthmarkets for HDPE film, while the more mature Western European market issteady but less robust. Many equipment suppliers say Eastern Europe isdeveloping as an especially fertile sector for HDPE film growth.Suppliers project strong growth for HDPE film   Equipment suppliers are unanimous in their bullish forecast for thegrowth of HDPE film. They say many processors, especially those in theU.S., are set to embark on significant expansion in their productioncapabilities over the next 24 months.   Processors are looking to upgrade the quality of their operations andfilm products by utilizing a host of incremental technical innovations.Many of these capital investments will involve processing lines for``high-stalk,'' coextrusion high-molecular weight HDPE.   HDPE film sales in North America are projected to grow at a healthyaverage annual rate in excess of 20% during the next five years, sourcessay. Much of this increase in business will come at the expense of LDPE andpaper, in various packaging applications.   An industry source at a major polyolefin resin producer estimates thetotal U.S. market for HDPE film in 1995 was upwards of 1.5 billion lb.,with a value in excess of $1 billion. About 150 billion HDPE film bags wereproduced last year for four major market categories: grocery ``T-shirt''sacks; thin-film industrial can liners; consumer garbage bags; and generalconsumer product merchandise bags.   Eastern Europe is cited by several equipment suppliers as a vibrantgrowth sector for the production of HDPE film. Many processors in theemerging market economies of Eastern Europe are moving aggressively toinvest in high-stalk, coextruded HMW-HDPE film lines, which typically carrya price tag in excess of $2 million.   Machinery builders point out that HDPE film's ability to be downgagedyet maintain physical properties is one factor that will continue to fuelits growth in both consumer and industrial packaging and insulatingapplications.   ``You can't downgage LDPE or LLDPE like HDPE and still maintain desiredlevels of tensile strength,'' David Nunes, president of Alpine American,Natick, MA, says. ``Also, paper prices are skyrocketing, while the demandfor T-shirt bags is growing at an extraordinary rate.''   Sources say U.S. paper prices are five times higher than HDPE film inapplications such as T-shirt bags. Recent reports quote the price of 70-lb.unbleached kraft grocery sack paper at $590 a ton, with supplies tight andprices expected to continue rising in the near term.Demand for grooved-feed extruders is picking up   Joseph Altimari, executive vice president, Black Clawson-Sano Inc.,Amelia, OH, says his firm's recent marketing alliance with Spanishmachinery builder Covex R.S. Extrusion S.A., of Barcelona, will seek tocapitalize on the growing market demand for grooved-feed extruders for HDPEblown film. Black Clawson-Sano last spring acquired the exclusive rights tomarket Covex HDPE film systems in North America.   The grooved-feed extruders provide stronger, more consistent, andpredictable extrusion rates compared with smooth-bore types. However,Altimari points out grooved-feed results in higher wear rates on machines.To remedy this, Covex has come up with a novel, proprietary groove designthat reduces back pressure and wear in the feed zone.   Covex film lines utilize an extruder design that reduces screw r.p.m. byas much as 25 to 50%, compared with existing standard machines, yetmaintains equivalent film output levels, according to Altimari. Inaddition, Covex has introduced a bi-layer die design with a singleextruder, which is said to orient HDPE film to help prevent the ``zippertear'' effect.   Paul Kiefel Extrusionstechnik GmbH, Wrentham, MA, and Reifenhauser Inc.,Peabody, MA, each offer 100-mm. grooved-feed extruders aimed at the T-shirtbag market. The machines are capable of output rates over 1000 lb./hr.Alpine is testing a 120-mm. extruder for HDPE, which has been adapted froman LDPE film system. The design will allow processors to run both HDPE andLDPE.   Reifenhauser has unveiled an internal bubble cooling (IBC) technology,which induces more ``neck-in'' for the stalk or neck of a film bubble.Matthew Bangert, vice president of sales, explains the IBC system decreasesthe neck diameter of the film bubble, just below the frost line. Thisenables processors to use larger dies to boost output rates withoutsacrificing the desired physical properties of the film.   Bangert says the technology achieves up to 30% neck-in for the bubblestalk; the typical neck-in range for most film lines is 5 to 15%.   Battenfeld Gloucester, Gloucester, MA, recently delivered an enhancedblown film ``swing'' line to an unnamed U.S. customer, which provides thecapability to change die diameters for the processing of eitherhigh-molecular-weight HDPE or LLDPE.   Bill Hellmuth, senior product manager, says the new line can switchbetween a 17-in. die diameter, for HMW-HDPE, and a 24- in. die diameter forLLDPE. The unit is equipped with a three-layer die and two extruders: 80-and 90-mm. The line has a 124-in. nip roll face and an output range of 1000to 15,000 lb./hr., depending on film thickness.   Brampton Engineering Inc., Brampton, ON, Canada, has launched its``Dial-A-Gap'' die gap adjusting system. Bill Wybenga, president, explainsthe system isn't an automatic gaging control; it adjusts the total gaparound the die's circumference.   Wybenga says the system, which can be electronically or manuallyoperated, allows processors to increase or decrease the nominal film diegap to suit the needs of the material and the output rate. The gap can beadjusted in a range of 0.5 to 3 mm. He says that operating with a morenarrow die gap increases the tear resistance and dart impact properties ofthe film.   Alpha Marathon Mfg. Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada, has introduced aspiral die with a ``flow-mixing channel'' to provide a consistenttemperature gradient at the spiral. This provides more exact film gaging,with improved optical properties and better machine-direction filmorientation.   An Alpha spokesman explains that each spiral is fed from two ports, andeach port feeds two spirals, which homogenizes the melt entering thespirals with a thermal layering effect. The screw also incorporates aspecial mixing tip.High-end applications include insulation   Most sources were guarded when asked to discuss new market areas forHDPE film. However, indications are that emerging higher-end applicationswill involve using the material as a conductive insulator or shield.   These applications include conductive bags and over-wraps, in areas suchas printed circuit boards, video and electrical cables, and otherelectronic products.   Hellmuth of Battenfeld says his firm is involved in new marketapplications, which call for the development of HDPE film lamination. HDPEfilm is laminated to a light-gage PE foam, providing conductive insulationand a protective covering for consumer products.   Gunther Neumann, a sales representative with Kiefel Inc., Wrentham, MA,says a well-established trend for new-equipment sales for HDPE film hasbeen the inclusion of coextrusion capability. He says feedback fromprocessors indicates they require the flexibility to pair the strength anddowngaging properties of HDPE with the clarity and puncture resistance ofLLDPE.   Reifenhauser has done proprietary development work with HDPE/LDPEcoextrusions, to produce higher-clarity film. The opacity typicallyassociated with HDPE is a surface phenomenon. LDPE, as an outer layer toHDPE, becomes a clarity enhancer.   Many processors and end users are evaluating the coextrusioncombination of HDPE and metallocenes, sources say. Application trends pointto using a metallocene as a skin layer over HDPE film. This combinationtakes advantage of HDPE's superior tensile strength, along with the tearresistance and enhanced surface appearance of metallocenes.New oscillating systems are among advances   Macro Engineering & Technology Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada, in Marchwill begin testing a horizontal oscillating nip on a lab-scale line. Abenefit of the design is a lower head-room requirement in processingplants, compared with a typical vertical oscillating nip system. It alsoeliminates the need to stand film on its edge, which reduces sagging.   Brendan Dorney, sales engineer, says this design is well suited for theproduction of HDPE film. He explains that the horizontal skew bars directthe film in a scissor-like manner through the 180 or 360 deg. of rotation.The fixed horizontal bars, like those in a vertical process, use an aircushion for lubrication.   Recent innovations from Egan Davis-Standard, Somerville, NJ, are a94-in. oscillating nip, and European-style surface winder. Rick L. Keller,industry director of film systems, says the new oscillating nip, introducedlast year, helps reduce gage variations in process, allowing for a moreuniform gage distribution, which results in a flatter, more consistent filmroll geometry. The nip is electrically driven and oscillates 720 deg.(+/-360).   The Egan surface winder has been rolled out to meet the demands of U.S.film processors, many of whom are showing a preference to automatic surfacewinders rather than center or turret winders.   Surface winders long have been considered the system of choice amongEuropean blown film processors. Keller says the Egan winder can handlerolls up to 50 in. in diameter, and enables processors to achieve a higherdegree of control in the film roll hardness.   Kiefel's ``light'' mono extrusion line (Compex 60 SA.L), is described asa lower-cost system for HDPE packaging films. The system includes astationary extruder with a standard 23 L/D screw length, an internal bubblestabilizer with a new high-slip, wear-resistant plastic cone, and dualirises for external bubble stabilization.Photograph(s):Photograph: Paper prices are said to outweigh HDPE film costs by afive-fold margin in most high- volume applications.

I believe that inthe past, we concentrated too heavily on the operational side. Only whenconfronted with change did we consider new strategies. The changesconfronting our industry were often politically motivated, such as takingback used products, quota regulations, or collection systems, and were notrelated to sensible economic practices. We plastics processors too oftenonly reacted rather than developed our own independent strategies. Thus,for example, we were not able to promote politically and publicly supportedwaste-to-energy recovery through incineration. Today, only a few Europeancountries favor this economic and ecologically sound method of wastemanagement.   We are confronted in all European countries with varied environmentalregulations at varied costs. The highest fees are found in Germany, tosupport the Dual System's (DSD) collection and processing activities.Recycling a kilogram of plastic costs about $2, three times the value ofthe collected material.   Last year members of the EuPC (European Plastics Converters Association)reoriented their philosophy and strategy toward the same goals proposed byEuropean politicians. The EuPC has taken the principles of ``sustainabledevelopment,'' as put forth at the 1992 Rio Conference, as tenets. We seethe fulfillment of Sustainable Development as insuring sustainableexistence for the entire plastics industry. Therefore, when the principlesof European plastics processors coincide with those of Europeanpoliticians, future conflicts between political and business goals can beavoided.PROFIT NEEDED TO WITHSTAND HARDSHIPS   European processors are mainly small to medium-sized businesses whichunderstand that entrepreneurial activities, including ecological aspects,have be economically viable. All new or additional ecological burdensplaced on our industry have to be both bearable and profitable to insurethe processor's economic survival. So far, this has not been the case. Ifwe are required to use recycled materials, then these materials should besold at rates that correspond to their actual costs.   There are a number of internal actions we as processors can take toalign ecological measures with our business principles. Resource and energyreduction, investing in modern technology to ensure better productivity andlow exhaust emissions, as well as sensible use of recyclate are just a fewof the measures we can contribute.   The products we produce have different life cycles of usefulness. Thehigher the quality and better the designs we manufacture, the longer theycan be used - therefore increasing the attractiveness for the customer whoshould be willing to pay a higher price.   By reducing raw material use and building in the collection andrecycling costs at the production stage, we can make our contribution toimproving both the environment and the cost situation.   Collection, sorting, and recycling of used plastics are today notcovered in the processor's cost calculation. They are usually paid bymunicipalities. The goal of the Rio Conference was to transfer these coststo the producer and seller. This is only possible when a realistic coststructure allows for a pragmatic cost/sales price ratio to cover therecycling process.   The EuPC is not propagating any single form of recycling. Of course,mechanical recycling, the sole technology which the processor can put intopractice, is only attractive if the costs of collection, separation, andutilization are under or at the same level as virgin raw material. If thecosts of sorting and cleaning plastics waste make mechanical reprocessinguneconomical, then other methods such as waste-to-energy recycling shouldbe considered.   By orienting our philosophy on the principles of sustainabledevelopment, we European plastic processors want to contribute our part inkeeping plastics, with its outstanding properties, a preferred material.This should stimulate growth in our industry and create jobs.   A growth rate of only 1%/yr. in the European plastics processingindustry equates to income of $214 million, which finances 6000 extra jobs.We thus see sustainable development making a meaningful contribution to allour social security.About the Author(s):Joachim Eckstein is president of the European Plastics Converters, aBrussels-based umbrella organization representing approximately 25,000predominantly medium-sized processing operations throughout Europe.

The merger would create the largest Class 1 railroad in U.S. history.SPI says that if the deal goes through, 75 to 80% of all resin producedbetween Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA, would be shipped by one company.This amounts to 39 billion lb. - or 72% - of U.S. resin production.   SPI is concerned about shipping rates. Transportation is 20% of resincost - the second-most expensive cost after raw materials. The group hasuntil March 29 to file an objection with regulators.   Union Pacific, which filed notice of the merger Nov. 30 and seeksapproval by August, doesn't believe it will lead to higher prices. ``Lowertransport prices will result over the long run,'' says regional marketingdirector Edward Trandahl. He notes 40 plastics shippers in support of themerger.   One supplier in favor is Andrew Smith, CEO of polyolefins producerRexene Corp. ``We believe the merger will provide more efficienttransportation service.''   One statistic to emerge from SPI's review is the impact of plastics onTexas and Louisiana. The industry employs 88,000 in those states, and pumps$21 billion into their economies annually.Photograph(s):Photograph: If Union Pacific acquires rival, it will ship 72% of U.S.resin.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   SABIC ADDS PET AND LDPE   Addition of these resins by Saudi Basic Industries Corp. will make thecompany, known by its acronym Sabic, one of the world's most broadly basedresin suppliers by 1996-97. Sabic already produces high-densitypolyethylene, linear low-density PE, polypropylene, polystyrene, andsuspension grades of polyvinyl chloride.   A 310-million-lb./yr. polyethylene terephthalate facility, includingcapacity for bottle grades, was due on line late last year. A770-million-lb./yr. plant for purified terephthalic acid monomer, a PETprecursor, is scheduled for startup in 1997, which would make Sabicself-sufficient in PET feedstocks (it already makes ethylene glycol).   The addition of conventional (high-pressure) low-density polyethylenecapacity is due on line in 1997. A 440-million-lb./yr. facility will makeheavy-duty bag, shrink wrap, and other film- and molding-grade resins.Abdullah Nojaidi, Sabic's president, says that local users in the MiddleEast now want their suppliers to provide them with LDPE to complement LLDPEin blending and other roles.   While LDPE has been losing share to LLDPE and HDPE for such applicationsas films in various regions, it continues to find use in many markets forthe process efficiencies it provides as a blending resin with LLDPE. Thereare also many process machines that are configured to run low-density PE,which are not likely to be replaced or upgraded soon to take LLDPE.   Sabic is also entering PVC emulsion (paste) supply, with a50-million-lb./yr. unit just brought onstream. Support facilities to makedi-octyl phthalate plasticizers (using a technology to be licensed fromJapan's Mitsubishi), as well as DOP feedstocks, are also underconstruction.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   PC SHORTAGE MAY PROMOTE RESIN ALTERNATIVES   Supply shortfalls, long lead times, and rising price continue to plaguepolycarbonate. Several suppliers of PC (and competing clear/tough resins)say lead times for delivering PC in North America, Europe, and Asia stoodat 8 to 16 weeks in late December. In October, a fourth price hike in sixmonths went into effect, bringing prices for blow molding grades to US$1.80to $1.90/lb. for volume buys, a rise of at least $0.30/lb. sincefirst-quarter 1995. Many accounts are on allocation. (See related article,p. 67.)   Users are scrambling to cope. In some markets, where compromise onclarity is feasible, a shift to lower-cost clear/tough styrenics isoccurring. Blending of PC and other polymers in opaque markets isincreasing, too. Bayer, for example, reports a shift in some markets toalternative materials in its slate like ABS/PET alloys. The result is thatclear styrenics, like Phillips 66's butadiene-modified grades and Novacor'sacrylic-modified resins, are sold out, with inquiries in medical and otherroles flooding in.   Indeed, some say a permanent change may be underway in select markets,as end-users learn to adapt to alternatives that sell for under $1/lb. ``PCshortfalls create a new mind-set - and a window for replacement,'' statesSteve Shelby, K-Resin commercial manager at Phillips 66, Houston, TX.Another approach is to send out metallized PC scrap (e.g., from compactdisks), which is usually landfilled, for cleanup by recyclers andsubsequent reuse.   ``PC today is simply precious,'' a supplier explains. Consultants pegcurrent PC capacity utilization rates at near 100%. And demand is viewed ascontinuing to outrun announced capacity increases through 1996-97,according to Bill Kuhlke, Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX. PC shortfalls andhigh costs could persist until 1998-99, observers say.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   LOSS OF GM WORK MAY FORCE SALE AT GENCORP   GM's switch from sheet molding compound to steel for body panels on theU-van platform has prompted GenCorp, the supplier of body panels, toconsider selling its Reinforced Plastics Div. Preliminary sale talks arebeing held with Cambridge Industries Inc., Madison Heights, MI.   GenCorp produced lift gates, doors, side panels, and other componentsfor the all-plastics-exterior U-van in Shelbyville, IN, since 1989.Production of U-van components will end at mid-year. Parts are also madethere for GM's Camaro, Firebird, and Corvette, Chrysler's Jeep, and Ford'sRanger.   Cambridge is a diverse automotive supplier that maintains 11 plants inthe U.S. It produces interior trim, exterior panels, and structuralcomponents.   Observers say GM switched to steel for economy. The automaker isredesigning the van for 1997 and anticipates volumes of 300,000 to 400,000,a production level that is more cost-effective for steel. In 1995, volumesreached 120,000 for the U-van, which consists of the Lumina APV,Silhouette, and TranSport models. Only 100,000 units are planned for 1996.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   PVC WINS 2, LOSES 1 IN LATEST GO-AROUND   Proponents of polyvinyl chloride gained ground in two high-profileregulatory showdowns.   In Berlin, the city legislature voted down restrictions on vinyl use inmunicipal construction, reversing a position that it took five yearsearlier. Thus, in Germany's future capital, PVC resumes a familiar role asa building material in windows, shutters, roof beams, and pipe.   In Canada, Toronto officials urged legislators to reject anactivist-proposed ban on PVC pipe. Testimony by the industry is creditedwith thwarting a citywide ban.

Gabriele   The U.S. and Europe are emerging as high-growth markets for theproduction and sale of blow molded intermediate bulk containers. Demand forthe specialized industrial containers is steaming along at an annual growthrate of at least 15%, a trend expected to continue over the next fiveyears. However, the wider use of blow molded IBCs is coming at the expenseof rotationally molded containers.   IBCs represent a class of large-volume (275 or 330 gal., and 1000 or1250 liter) industrial containers, with a blow molded tank enclosed andsupported by a tubular steel or welded wire mesh structure.   A critical boost to the growth of blow molded IBCs occurred in late1994, when the United Nations passed an international commerce regulation(HM-181E), which stated blow molded IBCs containing hazardous materialscould be reused. Prior to this ruling, only rotationally molded tanks couldbe recycled for the shipment of hazardous materials. The chemical industryand food processors represent the two major end-use markets for IBCs.Four major processors are located in U.S.   Tom Barrett, president of Scheutz Container Systems Inc., North Branch,NJ - one of four major U.S. producers of blow molded IBCs - notes thegrowth of blow molded IBCs is being pulled by solid demand from end users.``End users see the advantages in more efficient, cost-effective materialhandling, and safer overall storage of materials using IBCs, compared with55-gal. drums,'' Barrett states.   Hoover Material Handling Group Inc., with three production facilities(Mount Vernon, OH; Anniston, AL; and Beatrice, NE) is the largest U.S.producer of blow molded IBCs. John R. Redmond, president, estimates thathis company currently produces nearly half of all blow molded IBCs in theU.S.   Other U.S. processors include Sonoco Product Co., Lavonia, GA, andScheutz (production installations in North Branch; Atlanta; andPerrysburg, OH). Sonoco produces blow molded IBCs under a licensetechnology agreement with Sotralentz, a machinery builder and systemintegrator based in Drulingen, France.   A fourth company, Van Leer Containers Inc., based in Alsip, IL, isslated to begin production at a plant in Lawrenceville, GA, during thefirst half of this year. The firm is a unit of Van Leer Nederland BV,Amstelveen, the Netherlands.   Blow molding equipment suppliers for the production of IBCs includeKrupp Kautex Maschinenbau GmbH, Bonn, Germany; the Plastics Machinery Div.of Cincinnati Milacron, Batavia, OH; Battenfeld Blowmolding Machines Inc.,Boonton, NJ; Bekum America Corp., Williamston, MI; Ube Industries Ltd.,Tokyo, Japan; and Uniloy Srl, Calenzano, Italy.Two German equipment builders - Rikutec GmbH, based in Altenkirchen, andMauser-Werke GmbH, located in Bruhl - produce their own line of blowmolding machines for commercial sale, as well as process IBCs.   Hoover operates two Krupp Kautex machines - one in Mt. Vernon and one inAnniston. Last April, Hoover went on line with a new Bekum unit in Mt.Vernon.   Michael D. Hodges, Sonoco market manager, plastics, says his companyutilizes two Krupp Kautex machines at its Lavonia site.   Sources say there are as many as 15 processors in Europe producing blowmolded IBCs, with the companies concentrated mainly in Germany, France, andthe Netherlands. Scheutz Werke GmbH, Selters, Germany, (the parent firm toScheutz Container), and Van Leer are identified as the largest Europeanproducers of blow molded IBCs.   It's estimated that between 900,000 and 1.1 million blow molded IBCswere produced and sold in Europe in 1995, according to industry sources. Bycontrast, the U.S. market reached just over 400,000 units last year. Bothtotals represent a growth rate of 15% compared with the previous year, alevel of average annual increase anticipated to continue for this businesssegment through the year 2000, sources say.   Bob Zendel, Sonoco general manager, says IBCs are developing as apreferred mode of material transportation, replacing the venerable 55-gal.drum. Compared with the drums, IBCs are described as being more efficientcontainers, in terms of shipping space utilization, handling and storage,enclosure cleaning and reuse, and material dispensing, he says.Technical innovations for blow molded IBCs   The leading-edge technological trend for blow molded IBCs involves theuse of coextrusion techniques. Multilayer tanks can incorporate acombination of resin systems, or can make use of regrind material,depending on the application.   Sonoco and Van Leer this year will initiate production of coextrudedIBCs in the U.S. Sonoco will employ its existing Krupp equipment, while VanLeer will use a Rikutec machine. Hoover, with its Bekum unit, also willhave coextrusion capability.   In another development, Hoover recently unveiled its ``Tufftote'' lineof IBCs, which combines an inner HDPE blow molded vessel with a two-partouter RIM shell. The RIM material is a thermoset olefin (dicyclopentadieneor DCPD) known as Telene, supplied by BFGoodrich Co., Cleveland, OH. Theresult is a freestanding plastics IBC with no metal support frame, whichcan be stacked up to three units high.   Hoover officials say Tufftote IBCs have a 60% lower tare weightcompared with standard metal-caged containers, and eliminate the corrosionproblems commonly associated with metal frames when transporting varioushazardous liquid chemicals.Photograph(s):Photograph: Top: Hoover Materials Handling Group's Tufftote IBC combinesblow molded HDPE inner layer with 2-part outer RIM shell.Photograph: Bottom: Bekum America's BA 440 is used for blow molding IBCs.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   PEEK GETS PUMPEDBy:Joseph A. Grande   Metal is slowly taking a back seat when it comes to low-wear andlow-friction applications in the oil refinery and petrochemical industries.Polyether-etherketone (PEEK) is increasingly being used in stationary androtating wear components in centrifugal pumps which are used in oilrefineries, petrochemical plants, and pipeline installations.   A good example is a new large-scale refinery in Thailand. The builder,Caltex Corp., Dallas, TX, specified PEEK for the case rings in all therefinery's process pumps. It may be the first time that a new pumpconstruction has been specified with non-metallic wear rings, according toPEEK compounder and processor EGC Corp., Houston, TX.   In contrast to 410 stainless steel, bronze, or cast iron, PEEK isnon-galling and non-seizing when in contact with other metal-matingsurfaces. The formulation, called Xytrex 451, is a 30% chopped carbon fiberresin with tensile strength of 17,000 p.s.i. and continuous use temperatureof 350 to 400F. The material has a coefficient of friction that is sixtimes better than stainless steel, according to the supplier.

The system was introduced at K'95, and according toits developers has aroused considerable interest, not only among potentialcustomers, but also suppliers of additives as well as thermoplastics.   The Addmix system works with any type of additive in liquid form. Oneprimary application is colors, but Addmix says the unit is equallyappropriate for such additives as release agents, and even laser-sensitiveadditives used in moldings that are subsequently printed by lasers (Aug 95MP, 28).   As of January, the London-based company will supply off-the-shelfmanifolds that attach to the back of each mold. The additive is mixed intothe polymer melt between the end of the injection barrel and the mold. Byselective addition of the additive into the first part of the shot - thepart which becomes the skin layer of the molding - processors can cut downon their additives consumption by as much as 80%, depending on the geometryof the part. Users can adjust the volume of melt into which the additive ismixed, over a limited range.   Use of the manifold does not affect production cycle times. Although nodetails are available on the design and the means of mixing the additiveinto the melt, company director Simcha Kilim describes the manifold as a``form of hot-runner manifold.'' He says it does contain a non-rotatingmoving part connected to the injection head. ``It does not affect theregular behavior of the machine,'' he says. Additive is metered to themanifold using a simple peristaltic pump that delivers constant pressure.System helps molders save money, material   Kilim says that although it might appear at first that additivesuppliers would hesitate to embrace a technology that will reduce theirsales, companies supplying additives with low degradation temperatures areinterested because the Addmix manifold submits the additives to littlethermal and shear stress.   The Addmix system can be used in various ways. The company's maininterest is in skin molding, and around the middle of next year it willintroduce a version for multiple-cavity molds that enables selectivecoloring (diagram). In this system, melt is split into two streams, andeach stream can be mixed with a different color.   A manifold suitable for linking to a mold with a cavity around 200 cu.cm. costs around $8500 (5000). Addmix says that money can be recouped in afew months. It cites savings possible with a typical polymer with a basecost of $0.865/lb.   A yellow compound containing 1.5% additive priced at $10.468/lb. costs$1.009/lb. In production of a part with a 3-mm. wall thickness, the Addmixsystem can be used to give a skin layer of 0.5 mm. (1 mm. total). If thecolor in the skin layer is added at 2% for security, the total cost formaterial in a part weighing 1 lb. is $0.927, giving a saving of $0.08/lb.of processed material. The savings are even more stark when more exoticcolors, some of which cost over $70/lb., are used.Illustration(s):Illustration: Addmix manifold enables surface-active additives to beintroduced into skin layers on moldings.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   MD&M-WEST CONFERENCE TO ADDRESS DESIGN REGULATIONBy:Merle R. Snyder   Regulatory issues, technology advances, and global businessopportunities will be the focus of attention as participants from the U.S.and about 30 other countries gather for the 12th annual Medical Design &Manufacturing (MD&M) West conference and exhibition, Feb. 6 to 8, at theConvention Center in Anaheim, CA. About 800 exhibitors are expected tooccupy 112,000 sq. ft. of space.   An early session, Feb. 5, conducted by representatives of the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration (FDA), is billed: ``GMP (good manufacturingpractices) Design Controls and the New 510(k) Environment - a RegulatoryUpdate.'' Visitors may also sign up for 15 minutes of free consultationwith industry and regulatory agency experts in the ``Meet the Experts''forum.   The new GMP rule has been designed for compatibility with thequality-systems philosophy of the International Standards Organization(ISO) 9000 series of international standards. Manufacturers that properlyimplement design controls can also reduce their product liability exposureand minimize product development costs. The session will include discussionof the new 510(k) guidelines' impact on device marketing.   Specific topics to be addressed include implementation timing forspecific design controls; component, labeling, and packaging designcontrols; design input, verification, and output; biocompatibilityconsiderations; and proper preparation of a 510(k).   Also on Feb. 5, is a tour of the R&D and clean-room assembly operationsof Gish Biomedical, Irvine, CA. Gish manufactures medical devices used incardiovascular and orthopedic surgery, orthopedic and thoracic autologousblood recovery and reuse systems, and vascular access products for extendedhome-care infusion therapies. Tour participants will have the opportunityto meet with researchers, product designers, manufacturing engineers, andcorporate management in the course of the tour of the 150,000-sq.-ft.production facility.   Speakers in a Feb. 6 session on clinical trials will discuss the useof human subjects to determine a product's efficacy and marketability,while focusing on such issues as investigational device exemptions (IDEs),FDA regulations, effective clinical trial design, difficulties inconducting trials, and alternative techniques for overcoming problems.   In a partnership that is now entering its third year, the MedicalPlastics Div. of the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) is presenting aRegional Technical Conference (Retec) in an all-day session Feb. 7,concurrent with the MD&M West event. Hosted by Exxon Chemical's RobertPortnoy, and chaired by Udayan Patel of Advanced Cardiovascular Systems,the session is billed ``Application of Plastics to Medical Devices:Problems and Solutions.''Molders, designers seek global opportunities   International considerations loom ever larger in the medical devicebusiness. International standards-setting groups are creating a wide rangeof global standards regarding clean-room and aseptic processing andpackaging. A session on Feb. 8, instructed by Anne Marie Dixon, managingpartner of a clean room consulting firm, will discuss the work of ISO'sTechnical Committee 198.   Also on Feb. 8, speakers will address opportunities in Japan, greaterAsia, Taiwan, Europe, and Latin America in a session entitled ``GlobalExpansion: International Opportunities for Medical Device ManufacturingCompanies.''The market for medical devices and supplies in China is expected to surpass$1 billion this year. The country is therefore the focus of a session toinclude presentations by officials of the Ministry of Health, People'sRepublic of China, including: an ``Overview of the Chinese Health-CareSystem''; ``Hospital and Clinical Needs for Medical Devices''; and``Reimbursement Policies and Cost Containment.''   U.S.-China government initiatives will be discussed by Paul E.

According to industry observers, peroxides are still secure in suchcurrent applications as initiators for vinyl polymerization, curing agentsfor thermoset resins, and crosslinking agents for elastomers and PE. Butthey say that fast-rising competitors like metallocene catalyst technologyand electron beam processing could eventually edge out peroxides in theirpresent roles as rheology modifiers for PP and as initiators for productionof LDPE.   In the modification of PP, ``metallocenes definitely have an advantageover peroxides,'' says consultant John Murphy of The Catalyst Group, SpringHouse, PA. Right now, peroxides are often used to degrade PP in acontrolled fashion, after it emerges from the reactor. This``vis-breaking'' produces a polymer with a relatively narrow molecularweight (MW) distribution, a feature that improves its melt flow propertiesduring processing. But metallocene catalysts have the ability to produce PPright out of the reactor with the requisite narrow MW distribution. Suchpolymers in principle should need no post-reactor peroxide treatment.   There is little uncertainty in the minds of metallocene polymerproducers. Malcolm Kaus, Exxpol venture manager at Exxon Chemical, Houston,TX, declares flatly that Exxon's recently commercialized metallocene PPtechnology ``will greatly diminish, if not eliminate, peroxide use'' in thetreatment of PP. ``Of course this is only a projection,'' he adds, ``andI'm not sure in what time frame this will be realized.''   Besides Exxon, other developers of metallocene-based PP include HoechstAG, Frankfurt, Germany; BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; and Japan's MitsuiToatsu, Tokyo.Metallocene claims concern peroxide makers   Peroxide producers are taking the metallocene competition seriously.``We're definitely concerned about claims'' that metallocenes will displaceperoxides, says R. Gerald Gimbarski, business manager for organic peroxidesat Elf Atochem, Philadelphia, PA. ``I agree that metallocenes could be athreat,'' adds Ronald Pastorino, market manager for organic peroxides atWitco Corp., Greenwich, CT, although he says that any challenge is notlikely to materialize for ``several years.''   Electron beam (E-beam) processing is also presenting a frontal challengeto peroxides. E-beam processors claim that their systems have advantagesover peroxides in such applications as crosslinking rotationally molded PEstorage tanks and curing the resin in PE water tubing. For example, KarenButler, marketing director at E-Beam Services, Cranbury, NJ, points outthat peroxides, which are temperature-sensitive, are not compatible withhigh shear rates or the process temperatures required for high line speedsand thin-walled or intricately shaped products, whereas E-beam curing canbe used in these applications. She adds that E-beam allows more precisecontrol of crosslinking density than peroxides or other chemical curingagents.   One drawback of E-beam systems is that fabricators, who seldom wish toinvest in an E-beam facility on their premises, typically have to shiptheir uncured objects to a distant processor. On the other hand, the extratransportation costs are reduced by the savings from eliminating peroxidesin the formulation.   Despite stiff competition from other technologies, peroxide makers arecontinuing to innovate. At Elf Atochem, Gimbarski points to two recentintroductions under its Lupersol line of organic peroxides. These products,grades 610-M50 and 688-M50, are hexylene glycol peroxyesters that serve aslow-temperature, fast front-end initiators in the production of polyvinylchloride. They are intended to speed up polymerization cycle times.   The 610-M50 grade is also the first new peroxide additive approved inthe U.S. in 12 years not required by the Environmental Protection Agency tocarry a warning label of carcinogenic hazards. Elf avoided the label bysubmitting voluminous safety testing data to EPA.

Behind this trend are technical advancesover the past five years that have made liquid colorants more reliable andeconomical for many applications than pellet concentrates and other solidcolorants.   In particular, improved carrier vehicles have made liquid systemscompatible with just about all thermoplastic resins, and a new generationof highly accurate liquid dispensing pumps now offers consistent colorquality in fabricated products. The high concentrations of pigment in thelatest liquid systems also enhances their economic appeal for processors.   The liquid colorants industry received a big boost earlier this yearwhen Rubbermaid Inc., Wooster, OH, one of the country's largest plasticsprocessors, decided to switch from solid colorants to liquid systems inmany of its plastics fabricating operations. Details of the switch aresketchy, and Rubbermaid declines to comment on it. But according to oneindustry observer, the move will be ``very influential'' in convincingsmaller processors to adopt liquid systems.Business is booming for colorant pump suppliers   While there are few estimates of the size of the liquid colorantsmarket, suppliers of both the colorants and the dispensing pumps often soldwith them report that business is booming. ``Sales of liquid colorant pumpshave more than doubled for us this year,'' says B. Patrick Smith, vicepresident for marketing and sales at Maguire Products Inc., Media, PA, oneof the leading suppliers of dispensing equipment for liquid systems. AndMichael R. Shaughnessy, president of ColorMatrix Corp., Cleveland, OH, asupplier of liquid colorants, estimates that such products are growing``significantly faster'' in the U.S. than the plastics colorants businessas a whole.   Despite their inroads into extrusion applications, liquid systems arestill concentrated heavily in injection molded products. According to oneindustry observer, liquid colorants now account for 20 to 25% of thecolorants used for injection molded products in North America.   By most accounts, use of liquid colorants is far more widespread inNorth America than Europe. In explaining this disparity, industry sourcescite the fact that many European pigment manufacturers also make colorconcentrates, which have well-entrenched markets. Elsewhere, pigment makersare more independent and thus freer to experiment with new formulations.Nonetheless, liquid systems are catching on in Europe. In fact, newbusiness there has been so brisk that ColorMatrix recently opened amanufacturing plant near Liverpool, England, to address the market.Meanwhile, interest in liquid colorants is said to be particularly strongin Latin America.   Liquid colorants have come a long way from their first appearance in thelate 1970s, when incompatibility between their liquid carrier vehicles andmany thermoplastics caused slippage of extruder screws. Many formulationswere also slow to disperse in melted resins, and liquid dispensingequipment was often inaccurate or costly.   Today's liquid carriers - their compositions are well-guarded tradesecrets - are compatible with most polyolefin, styrenic, and engineeringresins; screw slippage is largely a thing of the past. Better millingprocedures are producing very fine pigment particles that make liquidcolorants easier to disperse than competing dry powdered colorants and eventhe liquid colorants of just a few years ago.Dispensing units are more accurate, less expensive   Perhaps the most significant factor responsible for the growingpopularity of liquid colorants is the accurate and inexpensive dispensingpumps that have recently come to the fore. These pumps are portable andgenerally cost between $1000 and $2500. Liquid colorants are oftenformulated for particular dispensing machines. In fact, such liquidcolorant suppliers as Ferro Corp., Edison, NJ, and Morton International,Chicago Heights, IL, also offer their customers dispensing machinery.   Although they differ in details, most current liquid color dispensingunits feature a peristaltic pump, in which liquid is released by periodiccompression and release of a flexible pumping tube by a series of rollers.The rollers are driven by a variable-speed, microprocessor-controlledmotor. Precise metering is achieved by automatic counting of each rotationof the motor, which is set to deliver a known amount of liquid perrotation. The liquid colorant always remains inside the feed tube and nevercomes into contact with the rollers or any other part of the pumpingmechanism. As a result, color changeovers can be rapid.   The colorant feed tube usually enters injection or extrusion machines inone of two locations: immediately below the hopper at the feed throat, orinto a groove machined into the base of the barrel. Both configurationspromote rapid mixing of colorant and resin in the barrel and an evendistribution of color in extruded or molded articles.   While liquid colorants usually cost more on a unit basis than powders orpellet concentrates, they are so concentrated (typically 75% pigmentloadings) that they are often more economical to use than competingproducts.   Despite the favorable economics, liquid colorants have been slow topenetrate some applications. Blown film is one such area, because liquidsystems are less efficient than the concentrates in achieving requiredlevels of opacity in very thin films.   Meanwhile, suppliers of liquid colorants are unveiling grades forspecial applications. For example, Riverdale Color Manufacturing, Brooklyn,NY, is developing liquid colorants for use with ABS resins.   Overall, growth of liquid colorants during the next year is expected toremain strong. Among the reasons, notes Riverdale Color president CharlesIrish, are recent price hikes for polyethylene, polypropylene, and othercarrier resins used in pellet concentrates. Because of the resulting run-upin concentrate prices, he says, ``more processors may entertain switchingto liquids.''Photograph(s):Photograph: Liquid colorant dispensing unit by Maguire Products.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   AUG 95 MP, 15   An article about machinery supplier Starlinger & Co. indicated thatthree years ago it bought, then sold, fellow Austrian company MaplanInternational (Aug 95 MP, 15). In fact, although Starlinger bought theentire Maplan International business, encompassing twin- and single-screwextruders and rubber processing equipment, it only subsequently sold thetwin-screw business (to Theysohn Extrusionstechnik, also of Austria). Itretains the remaining businesses.

This high-density process - a vacuum-coating methodwhich produces a glass-like surface - is performed at relatively lowtemperatures in a microwave bath. IKV scientists are predicting thetechnique can eventually be used to economically coat any size surface.   Its specific advantage is that properties of the polymer layersdeposited on the plastic can be modified through selective process controland aligned to a range of requirements such as crosslinking and the abilityto withstand chemical and mechanical stresses. This coating is free ofmicropores, has an amorphous layer structure, and offers good adhesion,even to nonpolar surfaces.   Previously used methods for applying coatings include painting them onthe lens surface, which carries the drawback of dust contamination and ionplating, and allows only low scratch resistance over small areas andentails long process times. Plasma-aided evaporation is another option.Here, clean-room conditions are needed, as well as resources to deal withsolvent-laden air.   Plasma polymerization's adhesive qualities are obtained through a formof process control which involves the formation of coupling agent layersduring coating. These layers are aligned to the substrate being used. Byvarying the process parameters, it is possible for the hardness of theinterface layer to be further tailored.   To obtain adequate scratch resistance as determined by the sand droptest (DIN 52348-1) on PC, a coating of 6 micron is needed. The coating rateis up to 2 micron/min., 50 times higher than plasma-aided evaporationsystems, says IVK's Harald Zell.   IKV engineers have developed a plant concept for the production oflarge-area coatings. So far they have been able to apply plasmahomogeneously over a width of 500 mm. at a deposition rate of 0.2micron/min.   Apart from transparent, scratch-resistant coatings, plasmapolymerization may find other applications. Since the surface tension ofthe coatings can be selectively varied, hydrophobic layers can be employedas anti-stick coatings. With hydrophilic coatings, good anti-mistingproperties can be obtained, since droplets of water on the substratespontaneously form a transparent film which doesn't scatter light. IKVresearchers say anti-permeation coatings for PE fuel tanks are also on thehorizon.Photograph(s):Photograph: Plasma polymerization permits glass-like, scratch-resistantcoatings (lower half) of injection molded optical parts produced with highdeposition rates.

Leaversuch   At first glance, today's fast-emerging information age looks like abonanza for some 500 companies worldwide that mold electronic connectors,and for their materials and equipment suppliers. Indeed, overall resin useshould continue to grow at about 10%/yr. Yet the breakneck speed oftechnological change in the varied end-markets that use connectors isdisconcerting.   In fact, the connector industry faces a tough, risky decade ahead as itcopes with expanding yet swift-changing demands by multinational giants whomanufacture computer, business machine, wireless, cellular phone,automotive, and other electronic systems, and which in turn depend onconnectors.   Ongoing evolution in electronics makes it difficult to understand orpredict market needs, according to a study to be issued in early 1996 byFleck Research, Santa Ana, CA. The consultant is estimating global unit andpolymer use rates for some 700 distinct connector segments through 2005.   A central dilemma is that the exploding demand for the number ofconnector units worldwide coincides with miniaturization and integration ofthe devices. Fewer, smaller connectors eventually can mean less resin usefor each application. Also, miniaturization intensifies the performancerequirements for both the connectors and resins selected to make them.   Miniaturization of connectors is driving designers to morelightweighting and precision, higher flame-retardancy ratings, and higheroperating temperatures as compared to the past, says Ken Fleck, coordinatorof the study. This opens new opportunities for resins like liquid crystalpolymer.Connectors claim 600 million lb. of resin   World connector markets attract captive and custom producers thatinclude major global technology powerhouses (table). In 1995, worldthermoplastics use in connectors hit 600 million lb., according to theFleck report. This includes about a 10 to 15% fraction of thermosets(mainly phenolic).   Thermoplastics in connectors tend to be high-performance, high-valuematerials. Most cost about $1.60 to $2.27/lb.; a fifth cost $2.27 to$9.10/lb.   Polyamides and thermoplastic polyesters are the most widely usedpolymers, followed by polyphenylene sulfide, PC, and liquid crystalpolymers.   The U.S. is the largest regional market, with a global share of 35%, or210 million lb. Its largest end-use markets are data communication, phone,wireless, computer, and automotive systems.   Western Europe and Japan each have roughly 25% of the world market forconnectors, with a dozen Pacific Rim nations supplying another 10%. Shiftsin automobile production (e.g., to the Far East, Eastern Europe, and LatinAmerica) in recent years have made automotive connectors more widely usedthere. They come in tiers used in the engine (e.g., anti-lock brakes) andpassenger compartment (seat belts), having quite different requirements.   Global demand for connector units is exploding. The report estimates 50%more connector units will be sold in the U.S. in the next five years, from20 billion to 30 billion units. But profiting from this expansion may beless than easy for molders and materials suppliers.Challenges come with changing electronics   The composition of connector markets is changing in lockstep withchanges in electronic products. For instance, 65% of the computers sold in1995 in North America were desktop models, and 9% were workstation models.But this 74% segment of computers consumed 90% of connector units and 96%of resin.   A decade from now, the market is expected to shift to notebook andhandheld computers, which tend to use fewer, smaller connector units. In1995, these categories made up 25% of computers, but used only 4% ofresin.   Another escalating design requirement is increases in the density ofpins (i.e., number per sq. in.), and increases in the pitch of pins andconnectors. Additionally, smaller connector designs generally involve lowershrinkage rates, thinner walls, and more precise processing.   The types of polymers used in connectors is in flux as a result of thesepressures. For example, Woo Young, Pyungtaek, South Korea, recentlyswitched a 300-pin connector for telephone exchanges to a nylon 46 from DSMEngineering Plastics, Sittard, The Netherlands. The Stanyl materialreplaces cross-linked PPS, and is said to offer problem-free insertion,high pin-retention, and soldering resistance to 260C.   At the same time, new versions of PPS, including linear grades made byHoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany, are replacing polyesters in some roles.A strong shift from thermosets to thermoplastics is also underway, Fleckreports.

Leaversuch   Compressible dye-tube moldings illustrate how designers can use plasticsto enhance manufacturability, consolidate parts, and reduce material waste.The cylindrical, lattice-walled, spring-like devices, injection molded inPP by Technimark Inc., Randleman, NC, compress 40% when under high-speedload, yet resist crushing.   The necessary balance of flexibility and strength, along with desiredthermal and chemical resistance, are provided by PP resins supplied byEpsilon Products, Marcus Hook, PA.   PP dye tubes are rapidly replacing stainless steel versions in the U.S.for high-speed winding of polyester and PP yarns through 270 degress F. dyebaths. The devices incorporate molded-in fins that allow the yarn to be feddirectly from the item to the subsequent weaving or knitting steps intextile-making. Moreover, a three-fold transfer of yarn to separate metaland paper tubing pickup devices (a process called ``backwinding'') isbypassed. These previously needed steps had added to labor costs, generatedconsiderable tubing waste, and degraded fiber quality.   The spring-like behavior of the PP devices in effect increases theeffective capacity of costly dye baths by 40%, and reduces chemicals andwater use. In 1995, Technimark expected to mold 30 million of thelightweight (0.25 lb.) parts for the U.S. market, where a rapid transitionto PP is underway.   Mike Pembroke, Epsilon's sales director, asserts that the application``extends the envelope of PP design capabilities.'' Technology and know-howfor processing the complex, high-tolerance part is licensed by JosephZimmerman, Aachen, Germany.   Technimark has adapted the tube design for the U.S. Two- and four-cavitymolds are used; cycle times are 10 to 14 sec. The processor has designed instop buttons to prevent overcompression of tubes. Machines used are 400-tonVan Dorn HT units. The disposable dye tubes can be reused in PPfurniture.Photograph(s):Photograph: Compressible PP dye tube design is transforming yarn dyeing.[Photo, Technimark]Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   EXPORTS AND LOW MONOMER COST KEEP SUPPLY AND PRICING STABLEBy:Robert Colvin   Subdued buying by processors and a quarter-by-quarter drop in the costof ethylene monomer helped to keep polyethylene prices last year fromrising to what many producers would have termed an acceptable rate. Badnews for the producers, no doubt, but good news for processors, especiallyafter 1994, which saw some of the steepest price run-ups for PE in recentyears.   Though manufacturers are banking on low customer inventories helping tostimulate buying in the first quarter of this year, chances are that priceswill remain pretty much where they were at the end of 1995.   In North America, for example, fourth-quarter polyethylene prices rangedfrom 37 cents/lb. for blow molding grades of high-density PE, to 40cents/lb. for low-density PE liner grades. These levels were downsubstantially from second-quarter 1995, when the average price for blowmolding grades of HDPE topped out at 50 cents/lb. and liner-grade LDPE hit48 cents/lb.   Moreover, in North America, ethylene monomer prices began the year at 31cents/lb. and finished 1995 at 21 cents/lb.North American pricing affects global resin costs   Not surprisingly then, North American LDPE prices are considered to bevery competitive vis-a-vis those of other exporting regions on the globalmarket. According to McGraw-Hill's Platt's Polymerscan, a pricing servicein London, offshore resin sources continue to exert an influence on globalpricing. In Western Europe, imports, though slowing, remain a factor in theprice structure of resin. Asian prices have weakened as a result of highavailability from a variety of sources, according to Platt's Hazel Marlow.   Among the various PE types, consultants note that HDPE inventoriesremain high and export sales show no signs of taking off. They attributethis to direct competition in film applications with linear low-density PE,which itself is hit by overcapacity.   Change might be in the offing in 1996, however. Advances in HDPE filmprocess technologies and blown film extrusion lines, coupled withprice-driven gains in large-volume markets like T-shirt bags, bode well forthe resin's use in many areas, notably, Western Europe and North America(see story, p. 44).   Compounding the situation for PE producers is market agitation inEurope. Investigators acting on European Commission orders swooped downlate last year on corporate offices of manufacturers Borealis, BASF, BP,DSM, Dow, Shell, Petrofina, Hoechst, Solvay, and Polimeri Europa, overallegations of possible illegal cartel operations in pricing. Theinvestigation, which is still underway, appears to have been prompted bycomplaints from processors and buyers stemming from limited supplies earlylast year, allegations of price fixing, and possible restrictivecompetitive practices.Formulation advances upgrade properties   Prices and politics aside, polymer technology is sparking optimism withregard to properties enhancements. DSM, Sittard, the Netherlands, has comeup with an injection molding grade of LLDPE, Stamylex, which offers highpurity and a narrow molecular weight distribution.   London-based BP Chemicals and Germany's Hoechst, Frankfurt, have comeout with a range of grades (rated as PE 100) for high-pressure water, gas,steam, and industrial pipes.   Not to be outdone, both HDPE market leader Solvay, Brussels, Belgium,and Borealis, Lyngby, Denmark, introduced at K'95 third-generation gradesfor similar applications (rated PE 80 and PE 100).   The high-pressure pipe grades are, for the most part, bimodal.   Hoechst is also eyeing future applications that will take market sharefrom other materials with its HDPE. Key among them is the hoped forswitch-over by Germany's mineral water producers from glass to polyethyleneterephthalate bottles, and the resulting demand for new bottle crates aswell as substitution of aluminum caps by HDPE caps.   Even machine manufacturers are getting into the act by upgradingextrusion lines for HDPE. Increases in competitive materials' prices andwaste-management costs have allowed HDPE film to make important inroadsinto the film market through its down-gaging properties. Reifenhauser,Troisdorf, Germany, for example, is designing better certain of its linesto fit the polymer's characteristics.   New capacity coming on stream includes production for specialty grades.One example is the new Borstar technology for manufacturingenhanced-property bimodal PE, which went into commercial operation at theend of last year in a 264-million-lb./yr. plant run by Borealis in Porvoo,Finland.   Quantum Chemical, Cincinnati, OH, has a new Unipol PE gas-phaseLLDPE/HDPE unit, with a capacity of 480 million lb./yr., set to start up atthe end of 1996 in La Porte, TX. At the same site, the company willmaintain its 85-million-lb./yr. LLDPE unit dedicated to making rotationalmolding resins. By the end of June, it will also have restarted a250-million-lb./yr. Unipol reactor at Morris, IL. Another Unipol LLDPEreactor at the site will be debottlenecked to raise capacity by 100 millionlb./yr. to a total of 400 million lb./yr.   In a final move, Quantum has plans to convert its dedicated LLDPEreactor at Port Arthur, TX, to a dedicated HDPE unit using BP technologyoffering a capacity of 300 million lb./yr. Work is slated for completion byOctober.   Other suppliers are also increasing capacity. Montell, Wilmington, DE,has started up a 440-million-lb./yr. PE plant at Lake Charles, LA, usingits Spherilene process technology.   Dow Plastics, Midland, MI, plans to debottleneck an LDPE plant inSarnia, ON, Canada, and an LLDPE train located in Fort Saskatchewan,Canada.   Polimeri Europa, the Enichem/Union Carbide joint venture, in Milan,Italy, will build a 400-million-lb./yr. Unipol swing reactor for HDPE andLLDPE in Brindisi, Italy.   Meanwhile, several companies say plants are scheduled for constructionin Brazil, India, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and parts of Southeast Asia andChina.   While few plans exist for deactivating plants, Dow Plastics recentlyannounced it is shuttering a slurry HDPE facility in Sarnia, ON, Canada,with a nameplate capacity of 160 million lb./yr.   Konrad Scheidl, former PE manager at Dow and now market analyst withMaack Business Services, in Au, Switzerland, sees one affect of all thisnew capacity on the market, especially that using swing technology toproduce either LLDPE or HDPE: loss of share by LDPE. These swing-capacityresins are making rapid penetration in the film market because of HDPE'sdowngaging qualities and alpha-olefin-comonomer LLDPE's improved tensile,heat seal, and impact strength, and high miscibility. LLDPE is calculatedby Maack to overtake HDPE this year in capacity growth, and to surpass LDPEin 1998.   Peter Toohy, manager of plastics sales for Chevron Chemical, Houston,TX, says he doesn't see LDPE rolling over and yielding market share soeasily. The resin is in big demand in countries where LLDPE is readilyavailable, but where processing equipment and expertise have not reachedthe levels of North America or Europe, he says.   Rob van Ooijen, PE manager at DSM, agrees. He adds that to compensatefor difficulties in processing LLDPE, an addition of 10 to 40% of LDPE canact as a blending agent. Thus, some plants that run LLDPE may still needlow-density grades for processability. DSM is one of the few companies tomake recent investments in LDPE facilities. Van Ooijen says production hasbeen sold out.   This year Union Carbide, Danbury, CT, is launching Ultra Tuflin, ahexane-based LLDPE aimed at replacing LDPE. It reportedly offers up to 110%more machine-direction tear strength (at 89 micron) than existinghigher-alpha-olefin LLDPE's.

On one hand, technology isexpanding the properties and applications potential of materials. On theother, burgeoning demand in developing countries is creating a huge marketfor plastics, while influencing supply and pricing around the world.   For processors, these trends signal opportunity and challenge. As thefollowing articles indicate, the capabilities of plastics design have neverbeen greater. New technologies, grades, and application concepts increasemarket penetration.   But growth can be difficult. The runup in demand for resins last year,much of it influenced by inventory buying to offset shortages, stretchedproduction to the limit. Some resins remain in tight supply. New capacityis coming on line, though, and 1996 is seen as a year of more balancedsupply and demand. Prices, moreover, should be relatively stable for mostresins.   Modest economic growth is forecast for most of the industrialized world.This should assure steady if unspectacular gains in resin consumption. Indeveloping countries, GDP growth and resin consumption will stay atdouble-digit rates.   This year will be one in which innovative technologies and expandingmarkets define plastics use. With no major economic problems on thehorizon, and supply and pricing relatively stable, processors have thefoundation in place for a successful 1996.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   STABILITY SEEMS TO BE AT HAND IN GLOBAL COMMODITY-RESINS MARKETSBy:Robert D. Leaversuch   Processors of large-volume resins have experienced an unusual degree ofchaos in buying raw materials over the past year. But industry seerspredict that 1996 holds the potential for greater stability (and sopredictability) in the cost and availability of polyolefin, styrenic, andvinyl resins.   ``Expect a reasonable equilibrium between demand and supply in 1996,''says Jim Fisher, president of consultant IBMA, Princeton, NJ. He and otherconsultants generally expect the prices of most volume resins to stabilizeat or near fourth-quarter 1995 levels early in the new year. But somesuppliers expect that a ``bounce,'' or slight upswing in prices, mightoccur. One possible harbinger of this: Dow Chemical, Midland, MI, saying PEis undervalued, announced a 5 cents/lb. across-the-board increase for Jan.1.   What disturbs processors most about an uneven pricing course is theuncertainty it entails in strategic planning. Volatility, no matter howslight, thwarts efforts to schedule production, control inventory, orfollow a business plan. An underlying concern about pricing is globaldemand. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene are maintaining growthrates, on average, at 50 to 100% higher than the typical increases in grossdomestic product for many countries, particularly developing nations.Memories of recent cost carousel linger   In 1994-95, volume-resin pricing took an erratic course worldwide(graphs). Global interconnections in resin supply are apparent in parallelpricing patterns for the U.S., Europe, and Asia.   Overcapacity and low pricing levels for the various grades of PE, PP,PS, and PVC had been widely projected for the period 1994-95. In fact,mid-1994 prices stood close to historic lows. Crystal PS in the U.S. was at45 cents/lb.; spot tags for PP homopolymer in Germany and PVC in Asia wereat $1000/metric ton.Unforeseen scenarios thwart business plans   But the unexpected intervened. A spate of natural and operationaldifficulties struck resin and monomer plants worldwide at the turn of 1995,pushing monomer costs up and disrupting resin supplies. A hoarding frenzyand six-month-long inventory buildup followed. Moreover, resin exports toChina, a burgeoning market, kept soaring. At the May-June peak, PS hadrisen by 26% in the U.S., PP by 35% in Germany, and PVC by 13% in Japan ascompared to mid-1994.   Around mid-1995, a reversal was underway. IBMA's Fisher attributes thisto effects of the continuing recession in Japan, to slowdowns in France andthe U.K., China's sudden retreat from aggressive resin buying (whichdepressed export prices), and a resultant inventory rundown. Major monomersfell in cost, but less so than resin; supplier margins were squeezed.   At presstime, all the large-volume resin prices had dropped from their1995 peaks, typically by approximately 25% in the U.S. and about 40% inEurope and Asia. Nevertheless, prices generally remain above the lows theyreached in 1994.   Ron Yocum, CEO at Quantum Chemical Co., Cincinnati, OH, a majorpolyolefins producer, says that the demand side for PE and PP remainsfavorable. He pegs underlying PE growth at about 1.5 to 1.7 times that ofGDP. National economies obviously vary by region, but in the developedcountries, this could yield growth in the low single digits - generally onthe order of 3 to 5%/yr. In countries like China, where GDP is increasingat double-digit rates, PE growth would be much greater.   But why did official PE demand in one major market, the U.S., rise by12% in 1994 and remain relatively flat in 1995? (Figures released atpresstime by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Washington, DC, show a0.9% decline in production and a 3% drop in sales and captive use for PE inthe U.S.) Inventory shifts, brought about by turmoil in 1994-95, obscured areal growth rate for 1995 of around 4 to 5%. Yocum sees continued growthbeing aided by technology (e.g., super-condensing modes that doubleLLD/HDPE capacity at 40 to 70% of cost), and improving polyolefinscost-performance.   In PP, suppliers expect underlying growth to be twice that of global GDPthrough 2000.Substantial growth seen in developing nations   Long-term, demand prospects favor other resins, too. Developingeconomies (e.g., China, India, parts of Latin America) represent a dramaticsource of growth for styrenics and PVC. For instance, PS use is booming inBrazil. Alberto Carvalheiro, commercial director of EDN, the top PSsupplier there, puts domestic growth at 25% for 1994 (a boom period) and10% for 1995. Underlying growth is 1.3 times GDP, and expanding PS use inpackaging and export products (appliances, toys, TV cabinets) is credited.   A striking example of demand strength is Mexico. Despite the collapse ofthe peso and a 10% decline in GDP, demand by packagers and export-orientedprocessors for some resins in Mexico actually grew in 1995. Monica Conde,an analyst with consultant IMPI, Mexico City, estimates that demand inMexico for polyethylene terephthalate, PP, and PS rose, respectively, by38%, 8%, and 4% last year.   By late 1995, some industry sources argue, the decline of prices forlarge-volume resins had bottomed out in the U.S., with inventories becomingmore in balance. IBMA's Fisher, however, says softness in many Europeaneconomies makes it less likely that prices there will firm up as quickly.He says that many countries in Europe have yet to fully address the highsocial cost of their social welfare policies. The seers pepper theirforecasts with caveats, most notably discounting the impact of a possiblerecession, or a new, unexpected round of plant shutdowns.   Stable monomer costs are one reason cited for expecting more resinstability in 1996. Fred Petersen of Probe Economics, Armonk, NY, who tracksmonomers, notes that ethylene, which gyrated from 16 to 28 cents/lb. in1994-95, is now at 21 cents/lb. Currently announced ethylene expansions, ifcarried out, should assure adequate ethylene supply for two years, Petersenadds. Propylene and styrene are considered likely to tighten slowly, notmoving upward before 1997-98.Planned capacity will meet demand   As for resin capacity, experts foresee two major waves of expansion overthe next several years. In PE, for instance, North American-based supplierswill add some 2.8 billion lb. (e.g., Novacor in Canada) in 1997-98, orenough to almost balance new demand. A much larger spurt in capacity is setto occur offshore, notably in the Far East. Most forecasts see world PEcapacity rising by 16% through 1998.   Bill Kuhlke of consultant Kuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX, puts today'sglobal PE operating rate at 86%. He sees growth absorbing added capacity by1998. Utilization rates by then would rise to 91%, which would put newpressure on pricing.   Super-condensing-type modes for LLD/HDPE plants developed by BPChemicals, Exxon Chemical, and Union Carbide make a second PE expansionfeasible. But the impact won't be felt before 1999.   In styrenics, consultants foresee crystal grades averaging 48 cents/lb.in 1996, a figure that is close to current levels. Added capacity in thestyrene-importing regions (Western Europe and the Far East) is seen causinga 50% drop in U.S. exports. Ed Glatzer of Chem Systems anticipates styreneaveraging 36 cents/lb. in 1996 and 33 cents/lb. in 1997, which would helpkeep PS and ABS prices low.   In vinyl, Richard Roman, Roman Assoc., Cleveland, OH, sees asupply-demand balance lasting several years. New capacity will about matchanticipated growth. The U.S. and Eastern European producers, moreover, arelikely to be export bases for meeting the PVC needs of developing nations.Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Commodity resin costs were erratic in 1995, butforecasts project less volatility: United StatesIllustration: Graph: Commodity resin costs were erratic in 1995, butforecasts project less volatility: GermanyIllustration: Graph: Commodity resin costs were erratic in 1995, butforecasts project less volatility: AsiaCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   STRONG GROWTH WILL CARRY OVER INTO DIVERSE MARKETS AND APPLICATIONSBy:Robert Colvin, with Stephen Moore in Tokyo   Polypropylene is the only olefin resin in North America, Western Europe,and Japan to have registered substantive growth last year. The materialshowed most gains in blow molded containers (North America), sheet,profile, and film extrusion, and injection molded packaging.   These results stem from end-use growth and polypropylene's continuingversatility as a resin, which is expanding its use in areas likepackaging.   The results in North America, at least, also reflect a shift that tookplace in inventory and production last year. In 1994, U.S. sales of mostcommodity resins were at double-digit levels - at times beyond theabilities of production capacity, according to Kevin Boyle of OccidentalChemical Corp., Dallas, TX, chairman of the Society of the PlasticsIndustry's Committee on Resin Statistics. This in turn led to a run onpurchasing, which shifted inventories of volume resins from producers toconverters. As buying slowed in 1995, inventories shifted back toproducers, with the result being that in the U.S., while production of allplastics rose 3.4% in 1995 over 1994, total sales and captive use increasedby only 0.3%, according to figures released by the SPI at a press briefingin its Washington, DC, headquarters on Dec. 6, 1995.Resin's strength lifted U.S. production figures   Though SPI began including Canadian sales with those of the U.S. in PPlast year, thus making year-to-year comparisons with 1994 difficult, Boylenoted during the press briefing that had PP production been deleted from1995 U.S. resin figures, thermoplastics production would have declined byhalf, to 1.7% over 1994.   In many global markets polypropylene producers are, however,anticipating a first-quarter turnaround from fourth-quarter 1995. If thishappens, processors will find plenty of material - inventories at manysuppliers are reportedly hovering at around 6 to 7 weeks' supply. Prices,moreover, should remain at or around current levels in most areas. No wildfluctuations are predicted. Nor do many experts foresee PP supplytightening before 1999.   Consultant Phillip Townsend Assoc. Inc. (PTAI), Houston, TX, projects anaverage annual growth in worldwide PP consumption of 7.2% between 1994 and1999.   Continuing advances in PP performance are strengthening itsprice/properties ratio. A number of manufacturers have come up with ways toimprove properties and thus bridge the performance gap between the resinand select engineering polymers. Examples include the Hivalloypolymerization process from Montell, Wilmington, DE; injection moldinggrades of impact copolymer from Fina Oil & Chemical Co., Dallas, and newControlled Crystallinity PP (CCPP) resins manufactured by Borealis, Lyngby,Denmark.   Some observers estimate that as much as two-thirds of PP's consumptionincrease is at the expense of other thermoplastics. Robert Woods, businessmanager for PP at Quantum Chemical, Cincinnati, OH, says that due to gainsin clarity, renewed interest has surfaced in PP as a substitute for PET insome dairy and food containers such as peanut butter jars.   Rexene Products Co., meanwhile, has a developmental PP-based flexiblepolymer, Rexflex FPO, which the Dallas-based supplier claims will pullautomotive market share from PUR and foamed PVC, by virtue of its improvedmelt strength and a 35% lower density than PVC.   Joseph T. Bonk, specialty polymers manager, says automotive applicationsare expected to include skin-covered foamed instrument panels whosestrength will be that they are made from a single resin - PP - thus facilitating recycling. Since the material contains no plasticizers, windowfogging is not a problem. To meet expected FPO demand, Rexene is building a50-million-lb./yr. facility in Odessa, TX, that is to come on stream in thethird quarter.Asia remains large growth market   Outside North America, Western Europe, and Japan, the demand equationfor PP changes radically. Consultant Andrew Stevens at PTAI, for example,sees average annual growth for Asia (excluding Japan) of 11.5% through1999.   Demand for PP in China remains high and is growing by as much as 11%annually. Present local production stands at 2.64 billion lb./yr. comparedwith demand of 4.4 billion lb./yr. By 2010, some 8.65 billion lb./yr. willbe needed. Because local producers won't be able to meet demand, observerspredict that imports will not only meet consumption needs in China, buthave a ripple effect on global supply. Assuming demand remains constant andprice is attractive, excess capacity could flow to China and create tightsupplies elsewhere.   Tianjin United Chemical, Tianjin, China, has just started up an882-million-lb./yr. PP plant based on Montell technology. Two other882-million-lb./yr. plants have also come on stream: one in Guangdong,financed by Hong Kong and Taiwanese investors, and one at the ZhongyuanPetrochemical Union, which uses Montell technology.   Other important PP markets include India with about 16% yearly growthpotential. India, despite a population of about 950 million, has one of thelowest per-capita plastics consumption rates in the world, about 1 kg. (2.2lb.) The average global consumption rate is around 16 kg. (35 lb.) TheU.S., by contrast, consumes about 60 kg. (132 lb.) of plastics/person. Thepotential for PP (as well as other resins) is thus tremendous.   Major players like Reliance Industries, Bombay, and IndianPetrochemicals, Baroda, are expanding capacities. Domestic PP capacityshould rise to 1.19 billion lb./yr. by 1996 and to 2.64 billion lb./yr. by2000. Reliance is setting up a 771-million-lb./yr. plant at Jamnagar inaddition to a 771-million-lb./yr. facility at Hazira. This capacity willmake it the sub-continent's largest PP producer.   Elsewhere in the region, Pakistan's Ravi Chemicals Group, in a jointventure with British-based Alyph Ltd., is to build a 154-million-lb./yr.plant in Karachi - the country's first. Pakistan uses 110 million lb./yr.The balance is for export.Production expansions, consolidations proceed   Capacity expansions and realignments are, of course, ongoing everywhere.In Japan last year there was the merger of Tokyo-based Showa Denko andNippon Petrochemicals, which created a polyolefins giant offering 762million lb./yr. of capacity. This was followed by further consolidation inthe Japanese market with a union between Mitsui Petrochemical Industriesand Ube Industries, in Tokyo, to offer 992 million lb./yr. of nameplatecapacity.New capacity is coming on stream   Europe has 14 PP suppliers. Among them is Dow Europe, Horgen,Switzerland, which has plans to build a 440-million-lb./yr. plant at Bunain the former East Germany.   In Africa, meanwhile, Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany, has increasedcapacity from 132 million lb./yr. to 330 million lb. at its 50:50 jointventure in Sasolburg, South Africa.   In the U.S., Solvay Polymers, Houston, TX, is building a gas-phasereactor and also debottlenecking lines to increase capacity from 440million lb./yr. to 770 million lb. at Deer Park, TX, this year.   Exxon Chemical Co., which is also based in Houston, has plans to build a527-million-lb./yr. plant in Baytown, TX.Many plants are built, few are being closed   Will all this capacity be needed? Particularly in Europe where manyobservers have complained for several years that there is already too muchcapacity in place from too many producers?   Observers point out that although a number of plants are going up, fewolder ones are being decommissioned. Among the reasons that are cited forthis, according to Quantum's Woods, is that it may be easier to keep olderplants operating than to pay the cost of shuttering them and cleaning upthe property.

[Photos, DSM]Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   VOLUME IS BEGINNING TO BUILD AS END-USERS ASSESS RESINS' BENEFITSBy:Robert D. Leaversuch   Metallocene-catalyzed polyolefins have generated much notice. But 1996may be a watershed in determining their impact.   Until now, metallocene polyethylene (mPE) and polypropylene (mPP) resinshave been circumscribed by narrow (though widening) grade slates,confidential R&D, and patent disputes. Small, dedicated resin unitsoperate, but their capacity is less than 0.5% of market potential.   Now, the catalysts are being retrofit to full-scale units for everymajor polymerization process, which puts them into the productionmainstream. The trio of current mPE suppliers (Exxon, Dow, and Mitsui)becomes a pack in 1996. Five suppliers are set to launch mPP grades.Processors can also expect mPE and perhaps mPP technology to be licensed byother producers before 1996 is over (table).   The materials could help to sustain plastics growth rates at historiclevels (i.e., double the GDP). ``Metallocenes potentially allow polyolefinsto replace [some] higher-cost performance materials,'' states Ron Yocum,CEO at Quantum Corp.   There's little doubt among processors and suppliers that mPE and mPP canoffer cost-performance gains across a swath of specialty markets.Metallocene PE is commercial, in the U.S., in niches likecontrolled-permeation films (e.g., produce bags) and low-residuals wire andcable, and, in Europe, flexible hosing.   In dispute is how fast and how far grades can go in ``pseudo-commodity''markets. Pseudo-commodity applications use volume resins like PE and PP,but require property enhancements, like clarity and toughness, whichjustify a premium and are attainable via metallocene catalysis.   Examples are some clarity films (now served by LDPE), stretch film(typically higher-alpha-olefin LLDPE), and flexibles (plasticized vinyl andrubber).   Consultants foresee 1996-98 as a time when mPE and mPP extend theirreach (most rapidly in the U.S.) to larger markets: e.g., stretch film(superior toughness and cling), molded medical parts, and polymermodifiers.Battling constraints in metallocenes' use   ``There's no doubt about mPE's specialties role; what's less clear isend-user commitment in volume markets,'' says John Murphy of CatalystConsultants Inc., Spring Hills, PA. One reason for end-user ambiguity isthe desire to keep a low profile to retain a competitive advantage. Moresubstantive reasons for questioning the growth of metallocene materials usehave been resin capacity limits, cost, and processability.   ``Capacity limits are no longer a realistic long-term constraint,''declares Bob Bauman, of consultant Chem Systems, Tarrytown, NY. He saysthat in the past year, a number of suppliers have run mPE in gas-phase,slurry, loop, and high-pressure process units (table). Retrofits involveupgrading a unit's catalyst delivery system and changing reactorconditions, both done at modest cost.   Exxon has run 30 million lb. of mPE on a 1-billion-lb./yr. gas-phaseplant in the U.S. Thus, it seems feasible to capitalize on mPE benefitswithout building specialized or dedicated capacity - a view also taken byBP, Union Carbide, and Mobil. In theory, at least, it is feasible to use anew type of swing capacity - units that shift between metallocene andconventional catalysts.   Other sources point out the practical limits to retrofitting metallocenecatalysts to units. In fact (as with current LLDPE/HDPE swing units), thiscapability is likely to be used rarely, since units are large andinflexible. Except in large volumes, shifting between grades and catalystsadds downtime, increases off-spec transition material, cuts throughput, andraises cost.   A common strategy is to convert small, often aging, reactors to mPE, anapproach taken by Union Carbide, Hoechst, BASF, and BP. David James,Carbide's R&D director, suggests that dedicated plants best optimizecomonomer use at present (metallocenes being 10-fold more efficient thanregular catalysts).   Dow favors dedicated capacity. It has announced a 300% increase inworldwide mPE (tradename Insite) capacity for 1996. This includes a second125-million-lb./yr. unit in the U.S., and a 150-million-lb. unit in Spain.Len Azzaro, PE commercial director, says LLDPEs using Insite technologywill be made at a 400-million-lb./yr. unit by late 1996.Cost is an issue: will premium stay or be cut?   Metallocene PE catalyst costs 1 to 1.5 cents/lb. more than HAO-LLDPEcatalyst. This helps make mPE 10 to 15% costlier than LLDPE. And it createsa dilemma: dedicated units cost more to run, volumes do not yet justifydedicating full-scale units, and economies of scale are adverse. BalajiSingh of consultant Phillip Townsend Assoc., Houston, TX, says suppliersmust pare mPE costs to gain share. He sees catalyst costs falling to under1 to 1.5 cents/lb. in excess of LLDPE in five years.   In theory, this should lower resin prices. But Bill Kuhlke of consultantKuhlke Assoc., Houston, TX, expects suppliers (with an estimated $3.3billion in metallocenes investment) to keep premiums up, perhaps for aslong as 15 years, to pay back costs of development and in capacity. Otherssay the market will determine price, payback notwithstanding.   Exxon and BP plan to run mPE on large-scale gas reactors. This couldentail high operating costs, but they see it as the best way to seedmarkets as demand grows. Eventually, mPE volumes would rise, and afull-scale plant could be dedicated. Estimates of when this crossover mightoccur range from five to 10 years.   Suppliers cite gains in making mPE more processable. Singh notes that ashift to metallocenes in markets like stretch film and medical moldings canbe a ``minor headache'' for processors versus shifting from LDPE to LLDPE.   Horst Maack, president of consultant Maack Business Services, Au,Switzerland, questions whether mPE can be run in Europe's (mostly LDPE)process equipment by just tweaking machinery. Maack says mPE involveshigher conversion costs for those adopting mPE in film in Europe. Changesin screws, die gaps, feed sections, and winding equipment add 5% to 30% toinvestment. And mPE also runs hotter than conventional PE, so throughputscould fall and costly controls may be needed.   ``A landslide in volume markets in Europe is likely when mPE matchesLDPE's processability,'' says Maack. He sees 200,000 tons (400 million lb.)of mPE use in Europe by 2000.   Hartz Mann, BASF's PE applications director, sees blending as one way tointroduce mPE in Europe. BASF's tubular LDPE capacity is said to be optimalfor plastomer versions (grades of 0.886 to 0.910 g./cc. density). Slurryprocess units may prove most suitable for high-density mPEs.   Penetration by mPE and mPP technologies also depends on licensing.Exxon, with a broad stake in patents, and alliances with Hoechst(catalyst), Mitsui (gas-phase process), and DSM (plastomers), may have anedge. But licensing also requires a servicing and know-how infrastructure,which may give Union Carbide and BP an inside track.   Roland Hingmann, BASF's R&D director for polypropylene, says thatrunning mPP in PP plants is feasible, if not as simple as for mPE. Theability has, in fact, been demonstrated by Hoechst, Exxon, BASF, and othersin gas and slurry reactors. BASF is promoting with its technology improvedhomopolymer, controlled-rheology grades, high-stiffness and -toughnesscopolymers, and reactor TPOs.These are the top contenders in the drive to commercialize technology forproduction of metallocene-based polymers*                                                Location of                                                dedicated       RetrofitSupplier        Material+       Process  **       capacity++     status***BP Chemicals,   mPE, `96           1             U.K.             CRLondon, U.K.BASF,            mPE              1,2,4         Germany           CRLudwigshafen,    mPPGermanyDow Chemical     mPE               3          U.S., Spain (`96)   CRMidland, MI      sPS+++DSM****          mPE,`96           3          Holland (`96)       CRSittard,NetherlandsExxon Chemical  mPE              1,2,3,4      U.S., France (`96)   CRHouston, TX     mPPFina            SPP,'96            2             ##                CRDallas, TXHoechst AG      mPP                1          Germany              CRFrankfurt       COGermanyMobil Chemical  mPE,`96            1             ##                CRNorwalk, CTMitsuiTokyo,          mPE                1          Japan                CRJapan           CONovacor         mPE,`96            3             ##                 -Calgary,CanadaPhillips 66Bartlesville, OK mPE               2             ##                 -Ube              mPE ,`96          1#            ##                 -Yamaguchi, JapanUnion Carbide    mPE, `96          1             h                  CRDanbury, CT* MODERN PLASTICS' estimates based on published sources and company data.+ Materials are polyethylene (mPE), polypropylene (mPP), syndiotacticpolystyrene (SPS), syndiotactic PP (SPP), and cyclic olefins (CO).** Process unit types used to run metallocenes: 1) gas-phase; 2) loopslurry; 3) solution; 4) high-pressure LDPE.++ Existing dedicated or semi-works commercial plants.*** CR indicates commercial runs in a full-scale, though not necessarily adedicated, plant.+++Joint venture with Japan's Idemitsu.****Joint venture with Exxon for 0.880 to 0.910-g./cc.-density-rangematerials.## No dedicated facility is running.#  50,000-ton unit using Exxon/Mitsui license.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   DEMAND MATCHES GDP GROWTH IN DEVELOPED NATIONS, SURGES IN ASIABy:Joseph A. Grande   Last year ABS demand stabilized in many areas and approached moretraditional growth rates.   Use of ABS showed a decline of about 8% in the U.S., the first drop infour years, while Europe managed a slight gain. Consumption was strong inJapan, which posted an 8% gain, the first significant increase in fiveyears. Meanwhile, the rest of the Far East had double-digit growth. Theoverall performance was a distinct contrast to 1994, which sawabove-average consumption.   ``Performance in 1994 was not real growth because we were coming out ofdeep recession,'' says Harald Laesche, ABS product manager at Bayer AG,Leverkusen, Germany. As a result, observers say 1995's weaker numbersshould be viewed within the market's overall performance of the last fiveyears. During that period, ABS has grown about 3% annually, in line withGDP growth of developed countries, says Ulf Buergel, business manager ofstyrene copolymers for Dow Europe, Horgen, Switzerland.Bayer acquisition changes global scene   The lineup of global players changed last year, as Bayer revealed plansto purchase Monsanto's ABS business. The move will more than double Bayer'scapacity and propel it into the top tier of ABS producers, alongside ChiMei and GE Plastics.   A global study of the styrenics business by consultant Chem Systems,Tarrytown, NY, predicts 5 to 6% annual growth through 2000. Mature U.S. andEuropean markets will see marginal gains.   Demand in Japan will grow at an average of 1.6% over the next threeyears, led by toys, leisure goods, and construction, according to the JapanABS Resin Industry Assn., Tokyo. Use in vehicles will decrease due to lowerproduction volumes and increased substitution of PP. Meanwhile, exports areforecast to grow at an average annual rate of 9.2%. Hot destinations areChina, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia.   The rest of the Far East will enjoy double-digit growth, says EdwardGlatzer of Chem Systems.   In inter-polymer substitution, competition with PS and PP is atequilibrium, suppliers claim. High-impact PS and PP continue to nip at ABS,however, particularly in appliances that were over-engineered in ABS. InEuropean autos, governmental requirements for impact at low temperature maybring back interiors that had been switched to PP.   One bright spot last year was continued demand for ABS and ABS/PC blendsin computers and telecommunications. Growth is spurred by miniaturizationand the ability of materials to provide thin walls, strength, and highprocessability. These blends are growing at a 15 to 20% rate inapplications such as cellular phones and notebook computers. On the otherhand, ABS has seen significant erosion in computer monitors and keyboards.PS has gained a strong foothold based on cost and lower physicalrequirements.   A key target for GE Plastics is building and construction. The firm ispushing Cycolac ABS, coextruded with a capstock ofacrylic/styrene/acrylonitrile, for window profiles, cladding, and othercomponents.   Most of the world's capacity buildup is in Asia. Chi Mei, Tainan,Taiwan, has plans to construct a 441-million to 882-million-lb./yr. plantin Singapore or Malaysia. The company also plans to boost capacity inTaiwan to 2.6 billion lb./yr. by 1998.   Toray Industries, Tokyo, will double capacity in Malaysia to 353 millionlb./yr. by summer, making it the largest ABS facility in Southeast Asia.   Improved processability remains crucial.

A shortage in fibers occurredafter a fast pick-up in demand that started in 1994 and carried throughfirst-half 1995.   Glass-fiber prices also moved up over 15% in 1995, though they are stillat sub-1980's levels. This year could see them rise again, from 5% intodouble digits, depending on market conditions, which are softening inareas.   Another issue is the decision by Owens Corning to phase out 10-micronfibers favored by many compounders (mostly European) and focus on 11- and14-micron fibers that are less costly to produce. That's reflected in theprice: OCF 14-micron fibers sell for around 15% less than 10-microngrades.   At Hoechst-Celanese in Dallas, TX, nylon 66 product manager ChuckCalhoun says the company has ``outstanding'' glass fiber-reinforcedproducts that rely on very fine fibers for much of their performance -performance that could be hard to reproduce with thicker types.   Jim Morelli, sales and marketing director at AlliedSignal, Morristown,NJ, is sanguine. Allied's Capron nylon 6 grades ``are very forgiving. Wecan use a significant number of types of fibers.''   Resin-wise, if demand stays around 7%/yr., there should be no problemsin nylon 66 supply. Nylon 6 supply is less critical, due largely to aslackening in the fibers market that enables polymer makers to divertmaterial to compounds. In Europe especially, millions of pounds of polymerfrom ex-East Bloc countries are available. Nylon 66 prices are thus firm,while nylon 6 price is under downward pressure.   While the auto market in North America is flat overall, growth in nylonswill come through increased penetration into manifolds. Japanese car makersare also switching to nylon manifolds.   Prospects, in fact, look good for nylon 6 in air-intake manifolds.Glass-reinforced compounds perform as well or better than 66 in partsassembled by vibration welding, which is replacing lost-core injectionmolding for manifolds fitted to some European cars. Allied says Capron HPN(high-productivity nylon) 6 grades, initially for packaging, may bepreferable to 66 in lost-core molding, since their high flow improves cycletimes and reduces core shift. The company claims the grades allowproductivity gains of 20 to 30% over standard nylon 6.   Bayer has programs with auto-makers for making large parts using hybridtechnology in which plastics, often nylons, are molded around large metalinserts. Parts include cross-car beams, door panels, and seat frames.   At Hoechst-Celanese, Calhoun cites good growth in niche automotiveelectronics, as well as in components for suspension systems calledspring-seat spacers. The components, each around 4 oz., replace fabricatedmetal, saving weight and cost.   Several companies are introducing nylons with improved high-temperatureproperties (Dec MP, 74). DuPont has added Zytel HTN semi-aromatic grades inEurope. Main target is automotive - fog-lamp housings, ignition parts,sensors, components for ABS brakes - but several electronics applicationsare turning up for dimensional stability and heat resistance. Grades have aglass-transition temperature 135 degrees F. higher than nylon 66;properties are marginally affected by water uptake. Creep is low.   Most activity for nylons in packaging is in films with improved barrier.EMS-Chemie, Domat/Ems, Switzerland, has introduced what it terms``multi-polyamides'' that contain over three types of nylon, and in somecases as many as five. The copolymers are for niches such as cheesepackaging, to prevent the ballooning that occurs when cheese gases can'tescape through skin packaging.   The materials replace PVdC in multilayer structures. According to EMS,they are as good as PVdC at keeping oxygen out of the pack, and better atletting carbon dioxide out. The materials are also said to be easier toprocess than PVdC. Their low melt point and crystallinity suit them forbiaxial orientation.Photograph(s):Photograph: Air intake manifolds can be molded in nylon 6 or 66.[Photo, DuPont]Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   SURGING DEMAND IN HIGH-GROWTH REGIONS BUOYS END-USE OUTLOOKBy:Martin O'Neill   Polyvinyl chloride sales were generally even in North America andWestern Europe last year, and off substantially (approximately 9.5%) inJapan. Reasons for the material's performance in these regions, apart fromthe continuing recession in Japan, include a second-half decline ineconomically sensitive end-use markets like housing starts and generalconstruction, conversion to competitive materials like PET and PP inpackaging, and, to a degree, issues of recyclability.   Exports, however, were up in many areas, notably from the U.S. (about1.4 billion lb. - a 20% jump from 1994); also, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, andEastern Europe. Factors influencing this range from the weakness of theU.S. dollar to European currencies like the German mark (though the pricedifferential is not as pronounced as it was in 1994), to overcapacity inJapan chasing developing market opportunities in Asia.   The outlook for PVC use this year varies by region. Since PVC demandtends to follow GDP growth in the developed nations, average growth isforecast for North America and Western Europe. Some economists predicteconomic growth in the 2 to 2.6% range for the Group of Seven nations - theU.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan - primarilyas a result of efforts to reduce budget deficits. Others predict that somenational economies will experience less growth - as little as 1.3% in theU.S., for example. The winner would appear to be Japan, for which growth of2.1% is forecast by some experts for 1996 - low compared to many countries,but a substantial jump from the 0.1% growth predictions for 1995 that weremade late last year.   In other areas, PVC could see sizeable growth. Infrastructure repair,for example, will continue in Eastern Europe, creating demand for windowprofiles. The growing economies of some Latin American countries and thecontinuing strength of Asia bode well for PVC use in these areas.   And while PET continues to take share away from PVC in packaging, someapplications are holding firm while others are reverting to the material.In France, Evian has switched from PVC to PET bottles for its mineralwater, and Vittel will follow suit this year. Yet due to its price, PVCcontinues to play a major role in bottled water. In film, one Europeangrocery chain is changing back to PVC from polyethylene for meat wrap, toget a shelf life of 2 to 4 days versus 24 hr. with PE.   The bright spot in the PVC market, as with other resins, is Asia, wherecapacity and demand are increasing, albeit from a relatively low startingpoint. Joint ventures among Japanese, South Korean, and Western companiesare prominent, but domestic development is also strong.   Thailand was a net exporter of PVC for the first time in 1994. It hasembarked on an ambitious expansion program that could see it become theworld's largest supplier in the next decade.   India's PVC market is expected to grow from 1.03 billion lb. to 1.76billion lb. by 2000, according to industry estimates.   Demand for PVC in Vietnam is 110 million lb./yr., but growing by 20%annually. Occidental Chemical Corp, Dallas, TX, and trading house MarubeniCorp., Osaka, Japan, are establishing a 220-million-lb./yr. suspensionplant in southern Vietnam, which is due on stream by 1998. The venture,Oxy-Vina Plastics and Chemical Co., is the first involving a U.S.corporation in that country since resumption of diplomatic relationsbetween America and Vietnam last year.   In China, PVC capacity is about 3.3 billion lb./yr. Imports amounted to1.07 billion lb. in 1994, including copolymers. The country plans tocomplete three plants before 1998, increasing capacity by 352 millionlb./yr., according to the Ministry of Chemical Industry.

[Photo,Veka AG]Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightMODERN PLASTICS via NewsNetJanuary 1996   REGIONAL GROWTH, OVERCAPACITY MAY CHANGE PATTERNS OF SUPPLYBy:Martin O'Neill   The phenomenal growth of PET in packaging over the last 20 years may beslowing in mature markets, like North America, but its potential in largelyuntapped markets assures solid growth for the foreseeable future.   G. Keith Mitchell, director of consultant PCI Ltd., in London, noted thepotential for PET in several regions at a conference late last yearsponsored by The Packaging Group Inc., Milltown, NJ. Per-capita consumptionin North America and Europe is, respectively, 3362 and 1150 g. But it'sonly 520 g./person in South America, 270 g. in the Middle East and Africa,and 220 g./person in Asia-Pacific.   Overall, observers say the outlook for 1996 is ``snug,'' with Europeprojected to import up to 363 million lb. of resin this year, a 7.8%increase over 1995. The North American supply-demand ratio should berelatively balanced in 1996, with quantities available for export to Europeand South America. Much surplus capacity exists in Asia and Asia-Pacific,where output is 20% for domestic use and 80% for export.   Meanwhile, the capacity buildup continues worldwide, and will have animpact as soon as next year. In 1997, Europe's PET imports are projected byMitchell to decline to 15 million lb. In 1998, he forecasts that Europewill be a net exporter, capable of shipping 321 million lb.   By 1997-98, if all the capacity that's under construction or plannedcomes on line, says Guido Ghisolfi, CEO of Sinco Engineering, an Italianbuilder of PET plants, there could be global overcapacity of 6.6 billionlb.   Among changes that experts like Ghisolfi see from this is a demand bythe major end-users of PET to stabilize the resin's price structureworldwide. Ghisolfi says that about 10 multinationals (e.g., Nestle,Unilever, Coca-Cola) consume 60% of PET. If such overcapacity occurs, itwould be a buyer's market, and the volumes these end-users consume willgive them much leverage in pressing for price stability - even to insistingthat prices not be tied entirely to raw materials' costs.   Such observations are speculative. Yet expansions continue.   Eastman Chemical is building in Spain and Latin America, and targets 3.4billion lb. in place globally in late 1998.   Hoechst will triple capacity to over 3 billion lb. by 2000, and maybuild in Asia.   Shell Chemicals will bring North American capacity to 1.1 billionlb./yr. In Italy, capacity will be doubled to 352 million lb./yr. by early1997, in Patrica.   ICI has a U.S. plant in precommission, which will boost North Americancapacity to 363 million lb./yr. A 264-million-lb./yr. European plant willcome on stream this year, raising the regional total to 484 millionlb./yr.   Meanwhile, Dow Europe has entered the PET business via an agreement withEnichem, whereby Dow acquires 80% of its Inca Intl. subsidiary in Italy.   In Japan, Kaneko is adding a 33-million-lb./yr. unit in Sabae tocomplement its 55-million-lb./yr. plant in Hofu.   Mitsui Petrochemical has absorbed Mitsui PET Resin Co., its bottle-grademarketing arm, to combine its PET and purified terephthalic acidactivities.   And China's Shantou Oceanic Group recently obtained approval to buildPET film and bottle-grade resin plants. Japanese sources believe China'stotal PET resin capacity will grow from 3.8 billion lb./yr. in 1994 to 5.3billion lb./yr. in 1997. Nonetheless, the country is expected to remain anet importer of the resin through the 1990s.

But relief is coming. This year there will be 135 million lb./yr. morein GE's Burkville, AL, plant, and a further expansion of undisclosed sizeat Bergen op Zoom, in The Netherlands. Bayer is debottlenecking threeplants, in Belgium, Germany, and the U.S.; and it is considering adding athird line in Antwerp, Belgium. Dow is also debottlenecking. Bayer,meanwhile, awaits approval - possibly in the first quarter - for a25-million-lb./yr. plant in China.   The net result of these expansions, says Bayer vp. Mark Witman, is thatsupply will be back in balance in 1997.   ``Demand will be strong in 1996, but not as strong as in 1995,'' saysDow Chemical's PC business director Mike Murry, in Midland, MI. GE's Lexanmanager in Europe, Robert Williams, expects a slowdown in growth to aslittle as 5%/yr.   Meanwhile, prices rose over 10% last year, with the highest jump in theFar East, where they are near twice those of mid-1994, compared to some 40%higher in Europe. Suppliers expect prices to stick in 1996.   Growth in the Far East remains strong. Production of PC in Japan waslikely to exceed 450 million lb. last year. Demand is fueled by electronicsand exports. With Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and South Korea active importersof Japanese PC, exports are again expected to account for over half ofJapanese shipments. Coupled with increases in domestic use, Japaneseshipments may rise 10% in 1995, versus 35% in 1994.   Korean demand for PC is seen surpassing 50 million lb. in 1995, owing togrowth in electronics and automotive. The market is expected to continueits dependence on imports until the only polymer maker, Samyung Kasei,completes an expansion to 66 million lb./yr. at the end of 1997.   Demand for PC in China, mainly from processors in Guangdong, will likelydouble by 2000. China imports almost all its PC. Local producers havecapacity of 5.5 million lb./yr., but production problems have seen outputdwindle to under 2.2 million lb./yr.   Production of CDs for music, computer data, and (soon) movies willprovide double-digit growth through the decade, with some putting thefigure at around 25%/yr. Bayer, GE, and Japan's Teijin are leaders in thissector; Dow has a grade in development.   Bayer is working on film insert molding for automotive and otherapplications. First commercial use of the technology has been small partson which the film provides functional markings on switches and dials. Filmswill be used for esthetics on larger parts. Films coming out of Bayer'splant in Berlin, CT, coextrusions of PC and thermoplastic polyurethane,have a soft touch.   Prospects for PC blends in bumpers don't look good. GE, however, isgetting Xenoy used in body panels (mostly fenders) on limited-edition carsas well as trucks. And it will supply material for the plastics-bodiedSmart car to be built by the Mercedes-Swatch venture in 1997 or 1998.   Packaging activity revolves around multitrip containers for milk andwater. Dairies in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland have switched to PCbottles, which can make 50 trips or more. Consumers like them because theyopen more easily than cartons and are lighter than glass. Retailers likethem because, being square, they fit better onto pallets and require 30%less space.   Three- and 5-gal. containers for mineral water are finding more use.Bayer cites double-digit growth in Europe, the Far East, and South America,and says the potential market is 10 times higher than today.Photograph(s):Photograph: Decoration and protection of automotive interior and exteriorparts are achieved by using PC film inserts.

Toensmeier   In 1996, MODERN PLASTICS will offer its own version of a ``worldwideweb.'' The ``web sites'' will be international plastics shows. Our ``webservers'' will be tabloids developed for each show and distributedon-site.   There will be at least seven shows so covered. They are, as highlightedon the map: Aseanplast, in Jakarta (Mar. 12-15); Argenplas, in Buenos Aires(Apr. 18-24); Plastexpo, Lyon, France (May 21-24); Mercoplast, Rio deJaneiro (Aug. 20-21); International Plastics Fair, Tokyo (Oct. 11-15);Ausplas, Melbourne, Australia (Oct. 22-26); and Interplas, Birmingham,England (Nov. 10-14). We may also produce a tabloid for Chinaplas, inBeijing (Mar. 26-30), and for Equiplast, in Barcelona, Spain (Oct. 20-25).   The tabloids will feature information about new products on display ateach show. They will also include overviews of local markets, businesstrends, and other issues of interest to processors.   Importantly, the news that MODERN PLASTICS acquires in developing thesetabloids, and in covering the shows, will be reported in the magazine aswell. And the contacts that our editors make in this process will help usto provide, on a continuing basis, the information and perspective onprocess technology, market issues, and business trends our readers need fortheir decision-making.   We will, of course, have a presence at more expositions this year.MODERN PLASTICS' global editorial staff will cover over 20 shows around theworld in 1996. Show coverage may seem routine. But it's an opportunity forreaders to review the latest developments in materials and machinery thatcan contribute to the capability and profitability of their operations.   In today's global economy, trade shows are not local events. Theproducts and technologies they feature have an impact on companiesworldwide. Show coverage is part of the continuing effort by MODERNPLASTICS to keep readers in step with developments that affect theirbusinesses, no matter where they do business.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill

MODULAR INJECTION MACHINES SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF REQUIREMENTSBy:EDITED BY MERLE R. SNYDER   The Allrounder S models have further extended the degree of modularityin Arburg's injection molding machines to incorporate units for all levelsof sophistication. The company has introduced two models, with platentiebar distances of 220 by 220 mm. and 270 by 270 mm. Both accept clampunits with clamp forces of either 17 or 28 ton, and injection units withEuromap designations 60 and 150.   These are all standard equipment. The 60 injection unit takes cylindermodules with diameters of 18, 22, and 25 mm., while the 150 version takes25-, 30-, and 35-mm barrels. The standard control is the Selogica, with a32-bit multiprocessor and a monochrome flat screen.   The 220S model with 17-ton clamp replaces Arburg's 170CMD, which willcease production in the second quarter (Arburg gave up production of largerCMD models two years ago). These two new machines go into series productionin February, and are part of what will eventually be a complete line.   Arburg says special attention was paid to floor-space requirements,noise emissions (maximum noise level is 72 dB) and ergonomic design. Forexample, mold-temperature control units can be fixed onto the frame of themachine and plugged into cooling water distribution channels integratedinto the machine base. Other peripherals can also be positioned in theimmediate vicinity of the machine. With high-end Selogica controls,multi-axis robots can be programmed directly from the machine controlpanel.   Electrical interfaces are integrated into the base, at front and rear.The water-cooled electrical cabinet on the front of the machine is dividedin two, with 23-v. electronics on one side and 230-v. electronics on theother.   There are four pump combinations on the hydraulics. The basic machinehas a servo valve for movements and pressure hold, a main pump, and amanual cooling water distributor. Users can opt for extended hydraulics toenable injection and clamp movements to run parallel, motor capacity can beincreased, and there are levels of regulation for the injection unit andfor cooling water distribution.   The clamp unit employs a double-piston system that is highly compact andalso provides good force distribution. The hydraulic valves are attacheddirectly to the rear face or (for core pullers) on top of the third platen,and oil is pumped straight to the pistons, without need for hoseattachments.   The central hydraulics unit at the rear of the machine isself-contained, and is easily fixed to the machine base. Replacement wherepossible of hoses by fixed metal pipes makes assembly easier and alsoincreases precision in use, since the pipes have fixed volumes. ArburgInc., P.O.

The VL2000 coinjection molding machine is thelargest of its kind ever shipped by Milacron. Two injection units feed intoa manifold that directs and meters the two different melts. Injectioncapacity of each unit is 232 oz. Either or both of the injection units canbe backed out of the manifold for independent purging. The manifold canalso be independently purged. Both the units and the entire molding processare integrally controlled by the Milacron Camac 486 Plus control system. Inoperation, a pin in the manifold moves to open path A, path B, or bothpaths together. The control system integrates simultaneous operation of thetwo injection units. In most cases conventional molds can be used with nomodification. The operation is essentially an encapsulation process.Separate core and skin layers can be molded. The skin layer of virgin,transparent, or other resin types is injected first. Next, the core resinfollows the skin resin, pushing the skin out in front of it. The core resincan consist of regrind, post-consumer reclaim, or a structural material. Asmall finishing amount of skin resin is injected after the core to seal thegate and complete the encapsulation.

The use ofmicro-processor-based systems assures reliable digital control of keyfunctions. This allows for more consistent decorating, improvedtrouble-shooting, and less downtime. Touch-button access on many units alsodisplays messages of machine functions.   20 Examples include equipment from Acromark, Berkeley Heights, NJ, thatfocuses on exterior marking of cylindrical and tapered parts, and featuresimproved marking speed, repeatability and safety. Its line of direct-actingpresses ranges from 1/2 to 20-ton force, with die areas from 4 in. by 5 in.to 24 in. by 36 in. Model 730RR variants include automatic loading andunloading, plus double-sided versions with double silicone rollers toincrease output speed to close to 60 parts/min. Applications include foilor preprinted heat transfer decoration of cosmetics containers, canisters,and bracelets.   Cassco Machines, Don Mills, ON, Canada, offers a system controller asstandard, allowing operation with turntables, slide tables, peripheralroll-on attachments, foil strip delays, and pick-and-place units. Controlextends to a dual-speed heat-transfer indexing system for multi-color imageapplication in a single operation. High-speed, automated systems range inuse from a 1/4-ton hand-fed application to an 18-ton automated factorypress.   Kensol/Franklin Hot Stamping Machines, Norwood, MA, assembleshot-stamping machines and makes foils, dies, and tooling at three U.S.facilities. The KF Model 500 1/2-ton air-operated press features auser-friendly microprocessor control system, micrometer depth-stop control,and dual-hardened steel head guides, in ball bearings, suitable forsilicone rubber dies and rugged enough to stamp with metal engraved dies.   Meanwhile, Air Hydraulics Decorating Systems, St. Louis, MO, offers astandard line of heat-transfer and foil machinery including horizontal andvertical roll-ons. The horizontal Accu-Roll is used to apply large heattransfers while eliminating air entrapment and foil wrinkling. Standardfeatures include a non-contact infrared temperature sensor, overheatingprotection circuit, and variable carriage speed up to 4 in./sec. A coaxialair/hydraulic cylinder carriage drive with left to right stroke motionsupplies stroke lengths ranging from 15 to 27 in.   Baier, Rudersberg, Germany, makes both direct-imprint hot stampingequipment and label-stamping with die-cutting machines for labelproduction. The company's Geba 1/PPP is adapted to the plastics-processingindustry, with three heads mounted at different angles to stamp variousparts in one operation.   Cosmetics containers and closures demand refined, fashionable colors,and eye-catching matte or high-gloss effects to produce an elegant imageand add value to products. Baier developed its new Geba 60 model forhot-stamping round, oval, and conical shapes. Advantages include fasttooling changeover for dies and holders, and economic small-runcapabilities. For larger quantities, the machine can be equipped with amagazine feed system. Capabilities include line or motif stamping, or bothcombined.Equipment is specialized to meet diverse needs   Because of its cost advantage and durability, hot-stamping isincreasingly used for storage boxes. Hydraulic and hydro-pneumatic machinesare most suited to this application. Baier's model Geba 4/HY has a stampingpressure of 15 tons. The movement of the plunger is dependent not ondistance, but on pressure, allowing differences in material thickness to beovercome. Throat and insertion height allow the processing of voluminousparts.   Kurz, Furth, Germany, has an in-mold decoration (IMD) technique,combining injection and hot-stamping of multi-dimensional, flat, or curvedthermoplastics parts for automotive components, cosmetics containers,electronic equipment casings, domestic appliances, watch faces, pictureframes, door blinds, and nameplates. Foils are fed through a custom-builtinjection molding tool.   During resin injection, pressure and heat from the material causerelease of lacquer layers from the polyester carrier, which bond to thepart providing good chemical and scratch resistance. The thickness of thepolyester carrier depends on decoration depth, part size, injectionposition point, and the material being processed. The spent polyester iswound off. Kurz claims this technique reduces costs by 10 to 50%.   20 Maple Roll Leaf Co. Ltd., Windsor, ON, Canada, manufacturespigmented stampings for use in automotive, appliance, cosmetic, orpharmaceutical industries. The company says bright colors can be applied todark substrates.   Stamp-Rite, Lansing, MI, manufactures steel hot-stamping dies for longruns. Dies can be surface ground several times with no measurable change inthe stroke of characters. The manufacturing process forms raised characterson the die while it is in the hardened condition, reducing distortion orshrinkage possibilities.   Transfer Print Foils, Inc., East Brunswick, NJ, claims to provide a wideselection of hot-stamping foils and laminates for decorating plastics.Customization of printed foils is available for such items as homefurnishings, profiles, and appliances.

NONNEMACHER AND DR. STEPHEN I. FOSTEREdited by William A. Kaplan   Hydrogen fluoride earns the highest hazard rating given by the U.S.Occupational Safety and Health Administration for dangerous materials inthe workplace. Even in low concentrations its effects can still causesignificant health problems. We have found that HF can be released frompolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) micropowders during compounding, and reachimpermissible levels capable of causing physical injury to workers. The useof acid scavengers has been found to be highly effective in eliminating thepresence of this hazardous substance.20 While studying the compounding of micronized PTFE (also termedmicropowders) in general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS), we encountered anacrid odor. Although ventilation was used to mitigate the odor, itpersisted, especially in the vapor space of confined packages of themicropowder and the concentrate. Our micropowder supplier thought the odororiginated from residual mineral oil used as a lubricant in its processingoperation and could be controlled by ventilation. This explanation did notsatisfy us and we discovered, surprisingly, the odor was HF. Although HFcan be liberated when PTFE decomposes at approximately 600 degrees F., thisis well above the processing temperature used in our study.20 During the next compounding run, measurements at the vent port and dieface of the extruder as well as in the vapor space of the gaylords showedHF concentrations well above 20 p.p.m. HF was also detected in the extruderhoppers, which fed the concentrate for subsequent processing. Theconcentration of HF in air was measured using a Sensidyne Model 800 pumpwith hydrogen fluoride detector tubes. The estimates of HF concentrationdepend on the degree of color change in the detector tube and the amount ofair drawn through the tube, and can be used to measure HF from 0.25 to 50p.p.m. However, no HF could be detected outside the gaylords or the plasticliner, or at a distance of greater than 4 ft. from the compoundingextruder.   Micronized PTFE is normally prepared from virgin or scrap PTFE resin ofeither the fine powder or granular variety. In producing micronized powder,the PTFE is first coarsely ground and is then subjected to either electronor gamma irradiation to reduce the molecular weight of the polymer. Inlowering the molecular weight, the PTFE becomes more crystalline; hence,friable and grindable. The particle size can then be further reduced toapproximately 1 micron by air-impact grinding.MW reduction process is a factor   This processing sequence was followed by our micropowder supplier. Fromdiscussions with PTFE industry experts, we learned that during theirradiation process, the molecular weight of the PTFE is significantlyreduced from the 2- to 5-million range to approximately 200,000. This isaccomplished by breaking the carbon-carbon bond along the PTFE chains, aprocess which creates many free radical species where the chains areterminated. These reactive free radicals can combine with oxygen and/orwater from the air to form stable organic acids and acid fluorides. Theacid fluorides can further react with water to form organic acids,liberating HF gas. Higher temperatures accelerate the liberation of HF.Thus, when the micropowder is compounded, HF is liberated and slowlydiffuses out of the concentrate.20 For example, one sample of the concentrate made during our study thatcontained 20% PTFE was analyzed to determine the amount of hydrolyziblefluoride, i.e., potentially releasable HF. The results indicate that thepellets contained 5 p.p.m. hydrolyzible fluoride, which was assumed to beavailable as HF. Assuming that a gaylord contains 1000 lb. of 20%concentrate and that HF is an ideal gas, we calculated that, if all the HFwere instantaneously released, about 3000 p.p.m. could be found in thevapor space of the gaylord. This calculation indicated that while theamount of releasable HF in the pellet was small, there is enoughhydrolyzible fluoride in the concentrate to account for the HF measured inthe vapor space of the gaylords. The difference between the calculated andactual amounts of HF in a gaylord is probably due to diffusion-limitedrelease of HF from the pellets.20 We conjectured that HF generation during compounding was aggravateddue to the high melt temperatures that were employed, which ranged from 500to 550 degrees F. Reduction of heating setpoints and throughput yielded alower melt temperature of 490 degrees F., but did not significantly impactthe generation of HF. We also hypothesized that pre-baking the PTFEmicropowder prior to compounding might reduce or remove much of the HF.Several types of baked and unbaked, high and low irradiation PTFE wereobtained from our micropowder supplier and were compounded using our normalextrusion temperatures, i.e., 500 to 550 degrees F. However, the level ofHF generated from the baked and unbaked samples was far in excess ofindustrial hygiene limits.Potential scavengers selected   Based on the chemistry involved and our calculations indicating that theconcentration of HF in the pellets was exceedingly small, the use of anacid scavenger represented a realistic approach to solving this problem.Similarly, the suspected role of free radical chemistry in the productionof HF suggested that antioxidants, which scavenge free radicals, might alsobe useful in solving this problem.20 Acid scavenger candidates were: calcium stearate powders, DHT-4A (Mgsubscript 4.5 Al sbuscript 2 (OH) subscript 13 CO subscript3 .3 .5 Hsubscript 2 O), and magnesium oxide powder. The calcium stearate andmagnesium oxide were pre-compounded into GPPS resin. Irganox B225 (fromCiba-Geigy), an anti-oxidant, was also investigated, since it might reactwith the PTFE chain ends to form a stable, non-reactive chain.20 Blends of the 20% PTFE/80% GPPS concentrate and the potentialscavengers were re-compounded using typical operating conditions. (Table 1)Potential scavengers were initially evaluated at loadings of 1% to provideexcess scavenger based on the measured level of hydrolyzible fluoride andthe reaction stoichiometry. The residual HF level was measured bycollecting a 7- to 10-lb. sample of the concentrate in a 60-liter PE bag,sealing the bag for five minutes, and then measuring the HF evolved in theair space. Upon discovery of a scavenger that resulted in a non-detectablelevel of HF, the level of scavenger was halved and the experiment wasrepeated. The lowest scavenger level investigated was 0.20%. (Table 2)   Additional evaluation of successful scavengers considered theirhydroscopic nature and the expected likelihood to agglomerate. Also, toconfirm that enough scavenger remained to prevent HF formation duringadditional processing steps, the preferred acid scavenger was initiallycompounded at a level of 0.25% into the concentrate and the resultingconcentrate was re-compounded two times.   Calcium stearate, DHT-4A, and magnesium oxide were determined to beeffective acid scavengers at 0.25 weight percent in the production of 20%PTFE in GPPS concentrate. Irganox B225 was not effective at the levelstested. Based on these results, calcium stearate was selected as the leasthydroscopic and having the smallest probability of agglomeration due to itslower melting temperature and fine particle size. Re-compounding thismaterial two times produced no detectable HF after subsequent passes. Thus,calcium stearate was incorporated into the production of the concentrate atour contract compounder. No HF could be detected in the concentrateproduced, in sealed containers of the concentrate, or in any area of thefacility. Industrial hygiene monitoring has since been routinely conductedand has failed to detect any HF.20 It is reasonable to assume that the calcium stearate reacts with theHF or HF-precursor to produce calcium fluoride (CaF2) and stearic acid.Both of these reaction products are considered innocuous materials from anindustrial hygiene and reactivity standpoint, particularly at these lowconcentrations. Stearic acid is known to act as a processing aid but atthese low levels it did not appear to impact extrusion conditions.   This information may be useful to other processors, but it is importantto verify that acid scavengers will work in a particular system bymonitoring the level of HF in various areas.Table 1: Operating conditionsScrew, r.p.m.                   400Torque, %                        80Extruder pressure, p.s.i.g.     240Extruder zone   Extruder temperature, Degrees FZone 1              331Zone 2              376Zone 3              375Zone 4              375Zone 5              375       Table 2: Scavenger experiment resultsPotential          Weight,    HF detected,    Pumpscavenger            %         p.p.m.        strokes*Control (none)     0.00          2             0.5                   0.00       less 20          1Calciumstearate 15F       1.00          0             4                   0.50          0             4                   0.25          0             4Calciumstearate           0.25          0             4Magnesiumoxide              0.25          0             4DHT-4A             0.50          0             4                   0.25          0             4Irganox B225       0.20        less 15             1* Sensidyne HF detector tubes are designed to be used with either 4 or 7pump strokes.

Grande   After a blockbuster 1994, demand for polystyrene eased to what many termrealistic levels in 1995. The market took off early in the year but fizzledby mid-summer, as inventories soared, prices rose before settling in thefourth quarter, and demand softened.   In North America, demand dropped slightly. U.S. production of PSdeclined by 0.9%, according to the Society of the Plastics Industry, whilesales and captive use were off by 2.6% over 1994.   Western Europe and Japan were relatively flat as well. A bright spot inEurope was expandable PS, which posted a 4% gain from demand for buildinginsulation in eastern Germany.   The Far East enjoyed strong growth despite tight import restrictions inChina.   Throughout the decade, PS should grow by 3 to 4% annually, says EdwardGlatzer, principal with consultant Chem Systems Inc., Tarrytown, NY, whichrecently completed a study of the styrenics business. Glatzer said themodest gains are attributed to more mature markets in North America andEurope and the loss of export business in Japan to offshore companies.Surging economies in the Far East, particularly China and India, will yielddouble-digit growth in those areas.   Suppliers see ample availability of feedstocks this year. Costs,moreover, seem to have settled. Though prices rose through the summer inNorth America and Europe, they have dropped 20 to 25%. Fewer imports intoChina forced prices in the Far East to drop during the summer, says KarlFoerster, PS market manager for BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany.   Market-wise, in the U.S., observers agree that polystyrene is under lesspressure for material substitution. ``The easy substitutions bypolypropylene have been done; it's a lot slower than 3 or 4 years ago,''said Marvin Sauers, PS business manager for Amoco Polymers, Alpharetta,GA.   In Europe, some volatility is possible, particularly in packagingapplications, because of the price gap between PP and PS (DM 0.90 to 1.20for PP versus DM 1.60 for PS), says Bruno Barbet, product manager for DowEurope, Horgen, Switzerland.   In North America and Europe, high-impact PS continues to penetrate thebusiness equipment market. As a less costly alternative to lower ABS andPC/ABS, polystyrene finds growing use in keyboards, monitors, and housingsdue to lower mechanical and thermal requirements.   In 1995, polystyrene completed its virtual replacement of ABS in 3.5-in.micro floppy disks, according to Richard Marchetti, director of marketdevelopment for Huntsman Chemical Co., Chesapeake, VA.   Oriented PS, meanwhile, is making strides in rigid food packaging.Grades with lower residual monomer don't affect the taste of packagedgoods.   BASF, Mt. Olive, NJ, will unveil this year high-impact,ultraviolet-light-stable grades that compete with PC/ABS in computerhousings. Under development are high-impact, high-gloss specialty gradeswith 20% better melt flow, equivalent gloss, and improved impact comparedto the company's workhorse grade ES 9524. The materials would compete withmedium-impact ABS in small appliances and other consumer durables.   There's not much expansion planned in the West this year, though BASF isadding capacity in Mexico and the U.S., and Novacor, Leominster, MA, isstarting up 70 million lb. in Springfield, MA.   Far East suppliers continue to build capacity, however, in response tostrong demand.   One project made Zhanjiang Zhongmei Chemical Industries Co., GuangdongProvince, China's largest PS producer, when it added a second88-million-lb./yr. line last year.

The Wall Street Journal summarized:  "Success is not at hand."  The EPA parking lot was at least half full, however, begging the question as to whether a plethora of regulations and proposals would drop into the hopper once the government reopens.  More than a handful of "non-essential" workers were sneaking into their offices anyway.  Unlike past involuntary "furloughs," questions were raised as to whether employees would get their paychecks, half a paycheck or none at all.

According to Czetzel, of 15 births in a small village in Hungary in 1989-90, 11, or 73%, were affected by congenital abnormalities.  Several of the women who gave birth had consumed fish contaminated with 100 mg per kg of dichlorvos, which is slowly released in fish treated with trichlorfon, he said.  In the study, researchers ruled out teratologic factors, familial inheritance and consanguinity.

EPA then filed a request for additional time, citing the furlough imposed by the government's budget impasse.NASSCO attorneys Lynn Bergeson and Lisa Campbell opposed the extension in a Dec. 22 briefing that traced the chronology of the proposal and argued that EPA has had plenty of time.  Among the statements by the attorneys for Weinberg, Bergeson & Neuman were:-- "EPA issued the proposed rule at issue over four years ago.  The proposed rule seeks to abate human health risks that, despite the passage of time, EPA continues to characterize as 'unreasonable.'  These human health risks are apparently not unreasonable enough for EPA to take action, however.-- "The Office of Management and Budget rejected the draft final rule and returned it to EPA on Oct. 18, 1995.  EPA informed NASSCO on Oct. 30, 1995, that it would not be withdrawing the rule by the end of October, nor would EPA commit to withdrawing the rule at any time in the future.  Within 24 hours of being so advised, NASSCO submitted the petition on Nov. 1, 1995.-- "Respondent (EPA) was served with the petition by first class mail on Nov. 1, 1995, a full seven weeks ago.  Counsel for respondent, Jon Lipschultz, called on or about Nov. 15, 1995, five weeks ago, to state that he had received the petition and would be working on it.  Indeed, NASSCO notified EPA that it intended to bring court action to compel the issuance or withdrawal of the proposed rule last summer, long before respondent was actually served with the petition on Nov. 1, 1995.  -- "Respondent's claim for the need for time beginning with the court's Dec. 14, 1995, order thus inaccurately reflects the amount of time that respondent has had to work on its response to the petition....-- "Respondent claims that the current furlough of federal workers affects it ability to prepare its response.  As stated above, respondent had ample time before the court's order was issued and before the furlough commenced to prepare its response to the petition...."NASSCO  concluded that "every day of continued delay in the issuance or withdrawal of the proposed ban harms NASSCO members."

Requiring decontamination facilities even after a crop has been harvested would be "an unjust and unduly burdensome economic expense to the producer," the Coalition for Sensible Farmworker Protection said.  EPA published proposed WPS decontamination changes in the Sept. 29 Federal Register (See Aug. 23, Page 2; Sept. 27, Page 19).  The agency proposed to shorten the amount of time in which growers must provide decontamination facilities to between one and 15 days for most pesticides.It would cost $4,400 to provide decontamination sites for 1,000 acres, the coalition said, criticizing EPA's estimate of compliance costs as "quite low."  "[T]he undersigned organizations continue to believe that it is inappropriate for the agency to require decontamination facilities at the end of the restricted entry interval," the coalition said.  The group includes state departments of agriculture, university agriculture departments and several trade associations.  Decontamination facilities should be required only when workers are present and have contact with pesticide-treated surfaces, it said.   The coalition also criticized EPA's proposal to require decontamination sites for pesticides with REIs longer than four hours.  Such determinations should be based on a risk-based, sound science standard, not solely on length of exposure, it said.The Yuma (Ariz.) Vegetable Shippers Association also said it would be expensive for growers to comply with the proposed decontamination requirements.The Society of American Florists asked EPA to apply the proposal to all pesticides, instead of only to those with REIs of four hours or longer.In its comments, the American Farm Bureau Federation proposed a zero-day decontamination period for all pesticides with REIs less than four hours.  A zero-day decontamination requirement for these pesticides would encourage the use of low-toxicity pesticides, it said.  "This makes lower-risk products more cost competitive."  Like the Coalition for Sensible Farmworker Protection, the federation called the cost of decontamination kits "significant."The federation also asked EPA to:-- "eliminate the requirement for a decontamination site after crops are harvested; -- "eliminate the decontamination requirement when the REIs expire, and-- "allow field workers to bring decontamination kits into treated areas as early entry.  EPA should allow growers to make similar arrangements for provision of decontamination kits for all types of agricultural workers."The Georgia Department of Agriculture asked EPA to simplify the proposed changes by limiting the number of exceptions to the WPS.  "[T]here are already too many 'if/then' statements or exceptions....  Regulations that are simple, easily comprehended and have few exceptions are more likely to be followed....  More exceptions usually mean more complexity and the more likely the regulated community is to be confused, which adversely affects enforcement," it said.  GDA proposed a seven-day decontamination site requirement after the REI expires.Columbia, Md., resident Louis True Jr., a former EPA official, said EPA failed to indicate why the agency plans to depart from its 1992 WPS regulations.  He asked the agency to repropose a WPS standard instead of modifying the current one.  "Absent such a step, there will have been no reasonable opportunity for public comment on a rational presentation of the basis for the proposed changes, and any conclusions drawn by EPA would be arbitrary and capricious," he said.The WPS changes EPA seeks can be achieved by a case-by-case review of labeling requirements rather than revising the 1992 regulation, he said.

EPA's problems with the later and current furlough were described in the agency's brief:-- "Judge Head's Nov. 14, 1995, order, which was filed following a feverish and pointedly irregular flurry of telephonic and letter writing attempts by counsel for petitioner/respondent to circumvent established agency procedures, clearly set forth the mechanism by which petitioner/respondent's requests for any schedule changes were to be decided.-- "In anticipation of federal shutdown which loomed and which in fact occurred on the very day that the judge issued his order, Judge Head directed that the parties consult with one another concerning the schedule and any alternative dates to be set immediately following the end of the federal shutdown.  It was clear from the judge's order that no responses to pending motions should be filed during the time period between the judge's order and the reopening of the federal government and the parties' taking the steps ordered by the judge.-- "In flagrant disregard of the judge's Nov. 19, 1995, fax-served order, on Nov. 19, 1995, petitioner/respondent dispatched its response to the Oct. 23, 1995, motion.  It did so even with the knowledge that complainant/respondent intended to file an amendment to its motion and could not do so at the time of the still-crippling federal shutdown....-- "Petitioner/respondent appears to have attempted to exploit the absence of counsel for complainant/respondent and their inability to take any actions in this litigation to its unfair advantage.  It filed a document which was affected by the judge's order and which it should have known should have only been filed following the ordered consultation with counsel for the agency and the parties' subsequent report to the judge."The brief pointed out that in addition to the controversy over use of the name "Smartel Communications," Piccozi had raised an issue as to whether the company should be called "Health Care Products" or "Health Care Products, Inc."  Accusing Piccozi of demanding changes in EPA's work schedule, agency counsel Philip Ross, Bret Williams, Carl Eichenwald, Davina Pujari and Scott Garrison complained:  "... Counsel for petitioner/respondent seems to think that the agency should 'drop everything' to meet the needs and convenience of complainant/respondent and its counsel.  Though counsel for complainant/respondent may have difficulty realizing that the agency has other matters to which it must attend other than business that pertains to his client, such is indeed the case."Back to Headline List CopyrightPESTICIDE & TOXIC CHEMICAL NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996EPA NOTICE LISTS SPECIFIC, CRISIS AND QUARANTINE EXEMPTION ACTIVITYIn a notice published Dec. 13, EPA granted specific exemptions to several states for the control of various pests.

Exemption requests were denied to:Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries; Arkansas State Plant Board; Georgia Department of Agriculture; Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry; Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, and Tennessee Department of Agriculture.Back to Headline List CopyrightPESTICIDE & TOXIC CHEMICAL NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996INDUSTRY, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS DISAGREE ON IMPACT OF TAKINGS BILLA broadly worded bill in the Senate that would compensate property owners and businesses adversely affected by federal regulation is drawing widely different reactions from environmental and business groups. The so-called takings bill could weaken pesticide regulations by making it prohibitively expensive for the government to impose usage restrictions, environmentalists said.  Business groups said the measure would give growers and landowners much-needed regulatory relief.  Either way, both agreed it could have a far-reaching impact on pesticide regulation.Both the Senate and the House are working on so-called takings bills.  But while the House bill targets wetlands, endangered species and water use, the Senate version, recently approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, contains broad language that could subject any regulatory agency to takings claims from private citizens, according to environmentalists. "Some restriction on the application of a particular pesticide that has the effect of reducing the yield of the land and therefore the short-term or long-term real estate values could be a taking under the definition of takings in this bill," said John Echeverr, general counsel for the National Audubon Society.  "As written, S 605 is extraordinarily broad and applies to any type of governmental regulation under any federal law," he said."The one exception to the bill is that if an activity constitutes a nuisance, then regulation on the activity does not constitute a taking.  But pesticide application as a nuisance generally doesn't have strong roots in common law," Echeverr said.Agricultural Groups Support Bill's ImplicationsJim Egenrieder, director of regulatory affairs for the Agricultural Retailers Association, said his group supports the broader implications of the takings bill.  "The growers are prohibited from using certain materials in certain areas without any recognition of the financial impact of some of those initiatives, and without going through any cost-benefit analysis," said Egenrieder.  "I think this takings legislation is asking 'Should a person be compensated when he or she can no longer use that land because of regulatory or legislative action?'"Floyd Gaibler, vice president of governmental affairs for the Agricultural Retailers Association, said a broad group of 15 agricultural associations and companies signed a Dec. 5 letter supporting the bill.  "We say it would clarify the takings standards that courts have not been able to clearly articulate," said Gaibler. The letter says, "The agriculture community increasingly is impacted by regulations which prohibit ordinary land uses just as effectively as if a highway were built across private land."  The letter goes on to say that farms are often collateral for operating loans, and that the accumulated value of land is often a landowner's primary source of retirement income.Sierra Club Calls Measure Anti-environmentalThe Senate takings bill "is a radical anti-environmental bill," said Roni Lieberman, media director for the Sierra Club.  "The bill distorts the meaning of American property rights.  In the case of pesticides, corporations could say they should be compensated for having to add environmental controls to their properties," he continued.Lieberman also said the bill would subject agencies to costly review to determine possible takings effects of new regulation.  "This is not about property rights, which are protected under the constitution," said Lieberman.  "It is about boosting profits," he said.Clinton Vows to Veto Senate Takings BillThe Clinton administration charged that the Senate bill would create "one of the most expensive new federal spending programs in recent history" and block new laws to protect public health and safety.  In a Dec. 14 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Clinton said he would veto S 605 or any similar legislation.  This drew a quick response from Hatch. Hatch Says Regulators Would Need to Step Lightly Around Property Rights"President Clinton astonishingly says this bill does not protect legitimate private property rights," said Hatch, who added that the bill creates a "system of incentives for agencies to reduce the number and size of the takings they commit." Hatch said a Congressional Budget Office report released in October suggests that the bill will not burden federal regulatory agencies with a lot of takings actions.  "That estimate concludes that the bill will have only minimal costs and will achieve the stated goals of the bill by encouraging agencies to change their behavior," said Hatch, adding that the provisions in the bill come out of current case law.  "So when we debate this bill, let's remember that many of the provisions of the bill are simply codifying what the Supreme Court has said the Fifth Amendment requires," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightPESTICIDE & TOXIC CHEMICAL NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996SORGHUM PRODUCERS GROUP CHALLENGES GRANULAR CARBOFURAN CANCELLATIONThe National Grain Sorghum Producers Association is preparing oral arguments in its challenge of EPA's decision to cancel sorghum uses for granular carbofuran.  Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb. 22 before the U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington D.C.The association said in its Nov. 22 pleading that EPA has no basis in the record for its conclusion that granular carbofuran poses an unreasonable risk to birds.  It also contended that EPA failed to hold a hearing on its final decision."EPA relied solely on avian mortality as the basis for its decision not to allow the continued use of granular carbofuran," the association said.  "After more than 10 years of study, there is no evidence of birds killed by granular carbofuran applied in sorghum in accordance with its label."The pleading charges that EPA "misapplied" data allegedly supporting its conclusion about avian deaths.  For instance, the agency referred to 41 incidents of alleged bird kills attributable to direct granular carbofuran poisoning, 25 of which were water fowls in rice fields in a single area in California, the pleading says, adding that this data is not relevant because new agricultural practices have eliminated water fowl deaths in rice fields.EPA also emphasized alleged raptor kills by granular carbofuran without strong evidence that reported raptor incidents were the result of exposure to the chemical, the association argued."Not only was the analysis EPA employed deeply flawed, the agency ignored studies that did not support its desired conclusions," the group said, claiming that EPA ignored Maryland and Florida field studies suggesting that granular carbofuran, when used properly, did not cause bird deaths.The association also accused EPA of denying its request for a hearing before the pesticide was canceled.  "A trial-type hearing would have allowed petitioner to more fully demonstrate the lack of evidence supporting cancellation of granular carbofuran on sorghum," it said.The association claimed that cancellation of granular carbofuran would cause hardship on farmers who would not be able to find an affordable alternative to control chinch bugs.  "An alternative to granular carbofuran for controlling chinch bugs, flowable carbofuran, is more expensive and requires different equipment for application," said the pleading, which adds that the additional expense of this application equipment is too expensive for sorghum producers farming fewer than 250 acres.

These were major recommendations this week of a committee of the National Research Council's Food and Nutrition Board.The report, "Ecologically Based Pest Management -- New Solutions for a New Century," was developed by the Food and Nutrition Board's Committee on Pest and Pathogen Control through Management of Biological Control Agents and Enhanced Cycles and Natural Processes, headed by Ralph Hardy of the Boyce Thompson Institute, Ithaca, N.Y.The committee saw an "urgent need for an alternative approach to pest management that can complement and partially replace current chemically based pest management practices."  Noting the introduction of synthetic chemical pesticides in the 1940s, the committee said:"It is now clear that their use has some unfortunate consequences.  Many consumers believe that trace residues of synthetic chemicals in food are undesirable and represent a significant food safety risk.  In some cases, undesirable environmental impacts of synthetic pesticides have caused consumers to oppose the use of these materials in agriculture and caused governments to regulate or outlaw their use."Ecologically based pest management (EBPM) as proposed by the committee would go beyond Integrated Pest Management's reliance on synthetic controls and "rely primarily on inputs of pest biological knowledge and secondarily on physical, chemical and biological supplements for pest management."  The description continued:-- "The EBPM systems will be built on an underlying knowledge of the managed ecosystem, including the natural processes that suppress pest populations.  It is based on the recognition that many standard agricultural practices disrupt natural processes that suppress pests.-- "In contrast to standard practices that disrupt and destabilize the agrosystem, agricultural practices recommended by EBPM will augment natural processes.  These practices will be supplemented by biological-control organisms and products, resistant plants and narrow-spectrum pesticides."As to EBPM's improvement over integrated pest management, the committee said:  "Early IPM innovators should be recognized for conceiving a framework for an integrated approach to arthropod, weed and pathogen pest management....  The practice of IPM, unfortunately, is not always consistent with the theory of IPM.  The focus of early IPM programs was devoted to control of insects, setting a precedent for the focus of IPM on arthropod pest management.  In many cases, this management was limited to pest scouting and precise applications of insecticides.  Consequently, this focus has been at the expense of IPM of weed and pathogen pests."The three fundamental goals of EBPM were outlined as:  "(1) safety, (2) profitability and (3) durability."The acute and chronic toxicities associated with synthetics generally have not been found with biological-control organisms, the committee said, elaborating on the second and third goals with:-- "For EBPM to be successful, it must also be profitable for the grower....  Because producers will implement only those pest control methods that lower economic risks and enhance profits, they will insist on assurances that biologically based tools are cost-effective and provide consistent responses....-- "EBPM strategies also must be long-lasting to have a positive impact on crop protection....  Decreasing the pest's rate of development of resistance to new inputs is essential for the durability of EBPM."Noting a "large annual research and development investment of more than $500 million" for the production of organic pesticides, the committee said, "... An increased investment in research of biological processes will be needed to support the development of EBPM."Monitoring, Certification Seen as NeededFollowing an extensive description of biological control programs to date, the committee outlined implementation steps for EBPM as including:Small-market support -- "Some of the most effective biological-control organisms and products in EBPM are projected to have modest uses or small markets, and will require public-sector support for regulatory approval as well as for research....  [T]he costs associated with obtaining registration can discourage commercialization of biological-control organisms, as is the case now for minor use chemical pesticides, products needed on small acreage or in such small markets that they lack commercial appeal.  In the same way that public funds help with approval processes of minor use chemical pesticides by regulatory agencies, public investment can ensure continued progress for biological technologies."Certification -- "Organized efforts to increase distribution of high-quality biological tools will facilitate grower acceptance of EBPM.  The procedure of crop seed certification by state agencies guarantees that new cultivars are genetically pure and that noxious weeds, arthropods and pathogens are below detection limits.  Each certification board tests, increases, releases and distributes new field crops according to predetermined standards....  Such a process of release benefits the individual grower with valuable information on product performance and quality, lowering the risk of adoption."Monitoring pests -- "Monitoring for the potential development of resistance by pest organisms is key to managing the long-term viability of ecologically based systems....  The importance of monitoring pest populations in individual fields is critical to the accurate assessment of tactics aimed at delaying pest resistance to biological control."Emphasizing the importance of "durability" of biological solutions, the committee said it "must be managed through collective action" and continued:-- "An effective mechanism currently used to delay pest resistance is the coordination of pest control activities among growers (National Audubon Society, 1994); sharing pest monitoring activities and collected information is useful in developing countermeasures that will limit additional crop losses.-- "Practices, comparable to the use of mixtures and multilines to conserve the durability of plant resistance genes, can be developed and put into practice in order to enhance the durability of valuable biological-control organisms and products.  Efforts to do this can be coordinated by industry, perhaps modeled on such organizations as the fungicide resistance working group, which is dedicated towards developing practices and implementation recommendations to enhance the long-term use of fungicides.  Cooperative efforts among researchers, industrial suppliers and growers can increase the durability of these biological tools."Gaps and Inconsistencies in Public Oversight ListedAfter devoting 19 small-type pages to research priorities and methods of accelerating research, including changes in institutional approaches, the committee's report delved into public oversight.  Listing "gaps and inconsistencies in current oversight" programs, the committee said in part:-- "... The complexities and anomalies of the current system may be attributed to the overlapping jurisdiction of several agencies and the diversity of organisms to be regulated, and the attempt to make the decision-making 'template' developed for registration of conventional chemical pesticides applicable to biologically based controls.-- "Current federal oversight generally evaluates the risks of biological-control macroorganisms using the procedures developed for exotic plant pests under the Federal Plant Pest Act (FFPA); microbial biological-control agents are subject to oversight procedures developed for chemical pesticides under (FIFRA).  Neither set of procedures is tailored for registration of biological-control agents; therefore, both pose unnecessary barriers to registration of biological-control organisms." 'Dual Review' at EPANoting that EPA reviews killed products under TSCA and others under FIFRA, the committee said the situation "results in a dual review process within EPA, with the manufacturing portion of the process reviewed separately from the field release of the killed microbial pesticide."  The distinctions in TSCA and FIFRA for review of "chemical intermediates" is irrelevant for microbial pesticides, the committee said.  The discussion of oversight continued:-- "The existing fragmented oversight process employs different assessment criteria to biological-control organisms that pose similar human or environmental risks, resulting in unnecessary scrutiny of some low-risk organisms and almost complete lack of regulatory review of others.-- "The most important inconsistency is the differential treatment of macroorganisms by USDA/APHIS under FFPA and of microorganisms by EPA under FIFRA.  For example, neither EPA nor APHIS regulates nonpathogenic nematodes, whereas both agencies regulate microorganisms.  In addition, microbes are exempt from oversight if vectored by a nonpathogenic, indigenous macroorganism (such as a nematode).  There is no clearly defined process for risk assessment of biological-control macroorganisms that are not plant pests, resulting in indecisiveness in granting permits for field release....-- "To provide appropriate oversight of biological-control organisms and products, USDA, EPA and other federal and state agencies with oversight authority should jointly develop criteria and protocols specifically for the testing, registration and use of living control organisms, biological-control products or plants resistant to pests or diseases.-- "No formal oversight structure exists for traditionally bred resistant plants, whereas genetically engineered resistance will, it appears, be subject to close scrutiny.  A question confronting policy makers is whether host plant resistance accomplished through genetic engineering should receive a higher degree of scrutiny than resistance achieved through traditional plant breeding.  Such a distinction embedded in regulatory practice would not necessarily reflect differences between actual human or environmental health risks posed by the two technologies."Options for Improvement OutlinedCalling for departure from current oversight practice, the committee said agencies' criteria for risk assessment must vary with the possibilities presented by each organism, product or resistant plant.  Suggesting the desirability of Technical Advisory Groups, the committee characterized these as "a consortium of representatives from government and research established to provide advice to the government on the safety of biological organisms for weed control."  The committee emphasized:"The U.S. EPA and the USDA, currently responsible for oversight of pesticide regulations, should develop and publish a guide to risk criteria, data requirements and oversight procedures that apply to importation, movement, introduction, testing and release or registration of biological-control organisms or products."The 89-page report concluded:-- "... Principles of ecology that lay the foundation of EBPM must be incorporated into implementation and oversight.  An important goal of EBPM is to restore and preserve balance to the managed ecosystem by duplicating natural processes to the maximum extent possible.  -- "Risk assessment also should reflect that principle.  Biological-control products must be developed and implemented in ways that complement managed ecosystems and facilitate the biological and natural controls already existing to suppress pests.-- "Monitoring of new products and processes is key.  The resultant information will lead to early identification of durability problems.  The knowledge gained from this monitoring of the dynamic interactions among organisms will increase the understanding needed to manage old and new pests in a safe, profitable and durable way."Back to Headline List WT03-B30-7IA059-000323-B003-84http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ch20.html 205.156.212.5 19970114210350 text/html 43502HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:01:29 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:01 GMTContent-length: 43315Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ch20.html Sample Issue Copyright PLATT'S INTERNATIONAL PETROCHEMICAL RPTS via NewsNet January 5, 1996 Vol. 15, No SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES CHINA TO CUT LPG, OLEFIN IMPORT TARIFFS TO 6% BY APRIL 1 (257 words) METHANEX TO BUILD 900,000 MT/YR METHANOL PLANT IN CHILE (138 words) NEWS UPDATE INDIAN CHEMICALS MINISTRY WANTS IMPORT DUTY CUTS (619 words) 1995 REVIEW NWE POLYMERS PRICES REACH EXTREMES IN VOLATILE 1995 MARKET (1127 words) ASIAN BENZENE PRICES SLUMP IN 1995 (775 words) US OLEFINS PRICES WEAKEN STEADILY AS DEMAND DWINDLES (2215 words) NEWS DIGEST: ASIA JAPAN'S SHIN-ETSU CHEMICAL CO LTD (81 words) ETHYLENE (136 words) KOREA ETHYLENE DEREGULATION (134 words) JAPAN'S IDEMITSU PETROCHEMICAL (82 words) NEWS DIGEST: EUROPE/MIDDLE EAST POLYETHYLENE TEREPHALATE (145 words) LPG (69 words) NEWS DIGEST: US/LATIN AMERICA SUPERFUND (142 words) UNION CARBIDE CORP (70 words) PROPYLENE OXIDE (124 words) PRICESCORE PLATT'S AVERAGE MONTHLY PRICES (29 words) CopyrightPLATT'S INTERNATIONAL PETROCHEMICAL RPTS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996   Vol. 15, NoCHINA TO CUT LPG, OLEFIN IMPORT TARIFFS TO 6% BY APRIL 1By:David Hanna, Christopher Park, Platt's TokyoChina this week announced plans to cut in half tariffs on chemical importseffective Apr 1, pledging to 'open the chemical sector wider to foreigninvestment'. Included in the change are import tariff cuts for olefins andLPG to 6% from 12%. The International Business Journal under Ministry ofForeign Trade and Economic Cooperation published two lists of new tariffrates for a total of 363 items, mostly related to petrochemical andchemical industries. Import tariffs for liquefied ethylene, propylene,butylene, butadiene will also be slashed by 50% to 6%. Rates for propaneand butane will be slashed by 3% to 6% starting April. New rates forimported benzene, toluene and xylene will be lowered to 6% from the present12% by then. China said it would cut import tariffs of over 4,000 items byan average 35% to 23% from Apr 1. No information was forthcoming on dutiesfor polymer imports. Traders in Korea and Japan peg current duty rates oncommodity polymers at 15-30%. China's Ministry of Chemical Industryforecasts that the industry's output value will grow by 8% from 1995 toYuan 245-mil ($306-mil) in 1996. Meanwhile, chemical imports grew by 8% to$5-bil, while exports rose 20.9% to $3.8-bil during the first half of 1995.Industry sources believe these figures should rise once the new tariffs gointo effect.Illustration(s):Table: China's New Import Duties (This table is not availableeletronically.

In its memorandum to the finance ministry which is preparing the 1996federal budget, the ministry has also suggested hiking duties on somecatalysts.   The chemicals recommended for duty reduction to 10% include carbon blackfeedstock which bears 30% tariff at present, napthalene which carries 30%duty, high purity limestone that is subject to 50% duty at present, andcumene that carries 20% duty now.   However, the import tariff on methanol may be set at 40% compared withthe present 50%. The ministry is seeking a cut in methanol duty from 50% to40%.   The items for which duty hikes have been recommended include fourspecific catalysts used in the manufacture of ethylene, formaldehyde,de-sulphurisation process, and methyl ethyl ketone from secondary butylalcohol (from the present 25% to 50%.   Simultaneously, the ministry has favored reduction in import tariff onspecific pesticides to 30% from the present 40% and in order to encouragecaustic soda chemical manufacturers to shift to membrane cell technologyfrom mercury cell process of manufacture, total exemption of capital goodsimports needed for this switch-over has been recommended. The present dutyis 25% on capital goods imports.   'The idea is to keep duties on basic rawmaterial low and the endchemicals onthe higher side.' 'The idea is to keep duties on basic rawmaterial low and the end chemicals on the higher side to make import offormer cheaper for export after value addition. Some sort of protection forthe indigenous industry against cheap imports and dumping has been one ofthe criteria,' explained a senior ministry official.   Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corp has selected NorskHydro and the Madras-based WS Industries as partners for a proposed 150,000mt/yr PVC resin project, expected to cost around Rupee 7.5-bil ($214-mil),TIDCO officials said this week.   Company directors have approved a proposal to offer 51% of the equity toNorsk Hydro, while WS Industries would hold 10% and TIDCO 11%. The equitysharing proposal would have to be approved by the Tamil Nadu government,which owns TIDCO.   The PVC project is likely to be located at Ennore, south of Madras,where a new port is proposed to be built by the government. The portproject includes building a chemicals import terminal.   The PVC project entails importing 124,000 mt/yr of ethylene dichlorideand 48,000 mt/yr as feed. A market survey commissioned by TIDCO showed thatthe demand for PVC was growing in the southern region, and that freshcapacity was called for.   At present, there are two major PVC producers meeting demand in southernIndia, Chemplast Sanmar with 48,000 mt/yr capacity, and DhrangadharaChemical Works with 42,000 mt/yr capacity. Both are located in Tamil Nadu.   State-owned Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd has been allotted land atBaikampady village near the New Mangalore port in southern Karnataka stateto build a chemical terminal, a company release said.   HOC will invest some Rupee 360-mil ($10-mil) in the 50,000 kl terminal,to be built in two stages. HOC, a major importer and exporter of chemicals,is currently renting storage tank facilities at the New Mangalore Port foroperations at Cochin, as well as for exporting phenol and acetone.   'In all, 10 storage tanks are expected to be constructed under phaseone. It is proposed to handle a diverse range of chemicals, includingbenzene, toluene, xylenes, cumene, phenol, acetone, and methanol. The firststage is expected to be completed during 1996-97,' the release said.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S INTERNATIONAL PETROCHEMICAL RPTS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996   Vol. 15, NoNWE POLYMERS PRICES REACH EXTREMES IN VOLATILE 1995 MARKETBy:Elinor Else, Platt's London   European polymer prices rollercoastered in 1995, peaking on high demandand tight supply but then crashing as a slower economy, high stocks andhigher prices undermined buying interest. Another major influence on Europewas the Asian market, whose demand was the main motor behind marketbalances world- wide.   All the polymers started the year at relatively high price levels, withthe polyolefins averaging around DM1.80/kg FD Germany in early January, PVCa few pfennigs lower and general purpose polystyrene a little overDM2.00/kg FD Germany.   There were some difficulties related to local currencies weakeningagainst the deutschmark in the UK and Italy which held back prices in thosemarkets. New import tariffs on polymers moving into the EU temporarilyslowed shipments from Mexico and eastern Europe. But underlying demand wasgood and supply was balanced to tight in most markets.   PVC, polystyrene and PP were all firm through the first quarter of 1995as producers pushed through targets and supply was either tight - as in thecase of PVC which suffered a series of monomer and polymer outages - or atleast balanced to supply.   But towards the end of the first quarter the first few signals of changestarted to emerge. Firstly, demand for low density polyethylene began toslip late in Q1 as consumers started to run down stocks built at the end of1994. Also, prices adjustments were made to bring countries that hadsuffered from a weak currency against the German mark back into line.   This meant a push for price adjustments in the UK, Italy and France butit also meant German prices had to be held steady while the rest of the EUcaught up.   Meanwhile, relative strength in German prices started to attract theattention of east European importers as well as sellers of other exotics.This began to undermine the German LDPE market, the market which tends tolead price levels around Europe.   During April and May PVC prices were stabilizing as demand for pipesproved slower than expected and finished pipe stocks were said to be high.Polypropylene and polystyrene were both benefiting from strongerfundamentals and prices for both of these polymers remained firm.   Two things happened: the traditional summer slowdown and a crackdown onVAT collection and smuggling of polymers into China.   The effect of the 'summer lull' is a regular seasonal effect and isfactored into most people's forecasts for supply and demand during theyear: in later July, demand will tend to slacken off as converters in muchof Europe close their factories for all or part of Aug. Demand in Sep isusually slow to start but will pickup until Oct, which is usually a 'normalmonth'.   However, the sudden halt to Chinese buying, along with the pressure onAsian prices from ample US export availabilities, was not expected. Theinitial effect was to divert a significant proportion of US and otherexports into Europe. Longer term, the effect was an overall dampening ofglobal polymer demand and a sense among consumers in Europe that there wasplenty of material available to cover their needs.   Prices for PVC, PE and PP started to erode in June as European buyerssensed a price decrease to come as the Asian problems emerged and Europeandemand was set to slow for the summer.   PS resisted as producers pushed for another increase and succeeded inboth June and July.   But by the end of July, all polymer prices were on a downtrend that wasonly to bottom out at the very end of the year. With Chinese buying onhold, exotic availabilities were plentiful and west European producersfound it more difficult to control stocks by selling excess supplyoverseas.   In addition, the summer lull lasted through Oct, adding several weeks ofvery low demand to the expected period as consumers rode down their stocksand were confident that prices would be lower in the coming weeks.   This process of destocking and buying hand-to-mouth characterised thelatter half of 1995.   The lack of forward buying kept up considerable pressure on producersand attempts to control stocks through cutting production were onlypartially successful.   There was considerable competition to maintain market shares in thevarious European markets: for example in the UK market there were severalinstances of producers undercutting each others' prices for PP and PE.Exports were moved out at discount prices to ease pressure on mountingstocks.   Through Oct and Nov, the production cutbacks did have an effect onproducers' stock levels which were better balanced by the end of the yearexcept for some cases in the PE market. The re-entry of Chinese buyers inNov lent some support to European and US markets, even if that demand wasonly a form of prebuying ahead of import license changes in 1996.   But prices in Europe had hit bottom and with or without China, many inthe industry said that with prices below available cost in many cases,there was no room for further price erosion.   PP, PE, and PVC all ended the year with the low end of the price rangefirmly below the DM1/kg FD Germany level. PS had fallen steeply but hadstabilized close to DM1.50/kg FD Germany for general purpose material andDM0.10/kg higher for high impact.   Increases were announced for Jan 1 for PP and PE, which were felt tohave reached unsustainably low levels. PS has not seen a price increaseannouncement and suppliers say they are looking to rollover prices from Decinto Jan. However, consumers say there is still room for a slight erosionin PS prices and as Chinese demand is not expected to pick up until laterin Feb, the impetus for price increases seems likely to be limited untillater in Q1.   PVC pipe grade has seen a period of poor demand, the summer too dry toallow for much construction or cable-TV pipe laying and the winter beingthe traditionally low demand season. Some are indicating price increasescould be on the cards for Mar or Apr.   In broader terms, most in the industry expect there to be someimprovement in early 1996 as demand and prices both recover to more normallevels.   Consumer stocks are more balanced now and prices are seen as eitherstable or firming, producers argue, so that when demand kicks in in lateJanuary, coverters will come into the market to top up low stocks.   Overall growth in underlying demand for polymers is expected to grow ataround 3% in 1996 and both buyers and producers are hoping for a lessvolatile year in 1996.Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Spot German Polymer Prices 1995Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S INTERNATIONAL PETROCHEMICAL RPTS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996   Vol. 15, NoASIAN BENZENE PRICES SLUMP IN 1995By:Joanna Lim, Platt's Singapore   Asian benzene prices began the year bullish, driven largely by strongstyrene demand. In response to spiralling styrene prices, Japanese andKorean producers cranked up operations at their plants, with less benzenesubsequently available in the spot market.   The strength of the US benzene market also led to less deepsea productmoving into Asia. At the same time, plant turnarounds in Japan and Korea inMar through June also heightened the region's shortage.   Benzene prices climbed $5-10/mt monthly during the first quarter, withprices peaking in April at $395-400/mt FOB Korea from $365-370/mt in Jan.   In May, styrene prices in Asia started to deteriorate, brought on byChina's sudden withdrawal from styrenic derivative imports, dueto Beijing'smeasures to crack down on smuggling and tax invasion in China's ports.   Local traders had been evading a 17% value added tax on imported resinsby negotiating private agreements with local authorities. State officialswere despatched to the ports to enforce the VAT collection, and thisbrought business to a halt.   Styrene producers throughout the region reduced their operating rates inorder to cope with high inventory. Japanese producers cut operations to by20-30%; Taiwan producers reduced production by 30-50% and in Korea, YukongOxichemical had a unscheduled shutdown of its 300,000 mt/yr styrene plantfor one week, citing bearish market conditions for the outage.   Furthermore, ethylene plants throughout Asia cut runs by 15-20% in July.Lack of Chinese demand for ethylene-derivative products had led to drasticdrop in its prices, prompting ethylene producers to run their plants justenough for their own downstream requirements, dropping their export ratioaltogether.   In Nov, benzene prices firmed in Asia, driven by a surge in Chinesedemand for styrenic derivatives. This time the Chinese government was knownto be planning to reduce the export rebate on the value added tax nextyear.   From Jan 1 1996, the current 17% VAT and 14% rebate for exports will berevised to a 9% rebate. The new rebate will apply to imported materialdelivered into China from Jan 1.   Traders also report that import licenses for 1995 are due to expire onDec 20, and that the Chinese government is expected to severely limit thenumber of new licenses issued next year.   These two factors prompted Chinese end-users - who were already low onstocks because of a clampdown on imports and speculative trading since May- to buy large quantities before the end of the year.   Last week Korea rejected bids at $240/mt FOB, holding out for $250/mtand above. The last trade into India last week was at $290/mt C+F. Thisweek sellers have brought up their offers to around $300/mt C+F, followingthe US Jan contract price nomination at 90 cts/lb, 10 cts/lb over Dec.   Meanwhile other consumers in Asia are staying sidelined amid uncertaintyover the benzene price trend. Most agree that in the short term the marketis firm. However, they refer to waning Chinese demand for styrene andethylene derivatives as the basis for a possible return to weak benzeneprices in Asia.   Toluene began the year on a bearish note in Asia, with ample deepseacargoes outpacing demand. It was only towards mid-March that the marketbegan to firm, as Korean producers began their plant turnarounds.   Between May and July, toluene prices held up relatively better thanbenzene due to its comparatively tighter supply. And, unlike benzene,toluene enjoyed relatively steady demand from China where it is used toupgrade 95 RON unleaded gasoline to 97 RON.   But toluene's decline escalated with the unplanned shutdown of two TDPunits in Korea in early Aug. In order to cope with their benzene andxylenes surpluses Korea's Yukong Ltd and HanWha Energy shut down their TDPunits indefinately from early August, and the surplus in Korean toluenewhich subsequently followed led to increasingly bearish market sentiments.Bearish benzene prices also severely softened the toluene markets.   Producers also had been quick to decrease their prices in order to tokeep arbitrage cargoes out of the region.   Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corp is known to issue monthly toluene buytenders for delivery two months out, thereby extending eligibility to US,NWE and other deepsea product.   Asian producers therefore did not rule out the possibility of thetraders shipping out additional toluene to Asia along with CPC's volumesespecially in times of weak market conditions in the US.   Currently toluene prices have firmed in line with tight supply and alsobecause of strong benzene and MTBE markets in north and southeast Asia.Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Spot Asian Benzene, Toluene 1995Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S INTERNATIONAL PETROCHEMICAL RPTS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996   Vol. 15, NoUS OLEFINS PRICES WEAKEN STEADILY AS DEMAND DWINDLESBy:Richard Capuchino, Platt's Houston; Nicholas Towasser, Platt's New York   US olefin markets experienced a downturn in prices through 1995, howevernone more drastically than ethylene and refinery grade propylene. Bothproducts lost about 10 cts/lb in contract prices from the beginning to theend of the year.   Ethylene began 1995 settling up 1 ct/lb in Jan, Feb and Mar to placemost contracts in 29-33 cts/lb range, while spot prices were at 31-34cts/lb FOB USG by the end of Mar.   The National Petroleum Refiners Association reported Q1 1995 inventoriesat 1.28-bil lbs, up from the 1.11-bil lbs in Q1 1994. Meanwhile, Q1 1995production totaled 11.64-bil lbs, down from the 11.70-bil lbs in Q1 1994.   By late Mar, demand began to fall, while spot prices also fell from thelow 30s to 28-29 cts/lb. Producers rolled over contract prices from Marchto 29-33 cts/lb in April and May.   Jun brought the first decrease in ethylene prices, when producers agreedto settle contracts down 0.50 cts/lb. Contract prices for Jul also settleddown 1 ct/lb to 27.50-31.50 cts/lb. Spot prices in Jul had also fallen to25.50-26.50 cts/lb due to consumers meeting commitments from contractmaterial.   The NPRA reported that both inventories and production increased in Q2.Inventories in Q2 totalled 1.88-bil lbs, a two-year high, while Q2 outputntotaled 11.95-bil lbs.   High Q2 inventories were due to turnarounds scheduled for Sep and Oct.High stocks and decreased demand from polyethylene producers caused severalethylene producers to cut production rates to about 80% capacity. By lateSep producers had settled Aug and Sep contracts down 1.50 cts/lb placingSep contracts at 24.50-28.50 cts/lb, with spot prices at 22-23 cts/lb FOBUSG.   By early Oct, at least one producer made a three-month nomination of Octdown 1 ct, November down 0.50 ct and a rollover for Dec. Some sourcesdoubted the nomination's chances of acceptance, and by mid-Nov it seemedmost consumers had chosen to take a month-by-month approach.   Around the same time a rumor circulated that Union Texas had offered tosettle October volumes with a formula of 75-80% at an Oct contract price of1.5 cts down from September and 20-25% at a Oct spot price of 15.5 cts/lb.Two Texas producers said they settled some accounts for Oct at a level'competitive' with the formula. One producer said the formula resulted in acontract price of 20.70 cts/lb for Oct, and settled some accounts at thatlevel.   Also complicating the Oct contract price was the question of at whatlevel exactly the Sep price had been. According to one report Exxon, in aneffort to devise a contract price that would more accurately reflect themarket price and eliminate the need for discounts, revised its Sep contractprice from 24.50 cts/lb to 23.50 cts/lb. However, another producer refusedto revise its Sep contact price, and maintained an Oct contract of 23cts/lb.   Early in Oct there was unconfirmed talk of some customers demanding anadditional 0.25 ct/lb discount on the Sep contract price, in addition tothe original 1.5 cts/lb decrease from Aug.   By late Nov, most sources reported settling Oct at 22-23 cts/lb, down1.5 cts/lb from Sep, though another producer, who had not yet settledaccounts, did report hearing an Oct contract of 21 cts/lb as a referencepoint.   By the year's end, neither Nov nor Dec had definitively settled. Someproducers reported invoicing or settling Nov down 1 ct/lb. One producerreported settling half its accounts with a two-month settlement: Nov at 20cts/lb, down 1 ct/lb, and Dec at 19.50 cts/lb, down a further 0.50 cts/lb.   Another producer reported some participants were working toward atwo-month agreement. He said a reduction of 1 ct/lb for Nov was tentativelyagreed, and that talks centered around whether Dec would settle down 0.50ct/lb or 1 ct/lb. However, one consumer reported offers to settle Nov atmore than 1 ct/lb down.   This week, one producer reported that settlements for Nov varied fromdown 1 ct to 1.50 cts/lb, and that Dec negotiations were still ongoing.   To compound the year-end confusion, in Dec several US PE producersannounced a 5 cts/lb US domestic price increase for all grades of PEeffective Jan 1. Similarly, one producer expected higher feedstock pricesas the colder weather might make producers less inclined to giveconcessions.   Fiber grade ethylene glycol began the year tight due to strong globaldemand for polyester, while weather continued to affect demand ofanti-freeze grade. Spot prices for A-F grade began the year at 30-31 cts/lbFOB USG. Industrial grade was pegged at 29-31 cts/lb at first of the year,with contract prices for fiber grade at 28.5 cts/lb.   Strong demand for PET kept the MEG market tight. Fiber grade was tight,with spot supply almost non-existent at the beginning of the year.   In Mar, producers nominated a 2 ct/lb increase for fiber grade due tostrong demand and extremely low inventories. By mid-Apr, fiber grade hadsettled at 30.5 cts/lb, while industrial and A-F grade were at 30-32 cts/lbfor spot deals.   In mid-Apr sources reported that A-F grade buyers were looking to indusgrade market for incremental volumes. Export demand for fiber grade wasdescribed as 'phenomenal' in May.   In early Jun, one producer nominated 2 ct/lb increases on all grades forboth list and off-list prices. Stocks on all three grades remainedrelatively low.   Spot prices in late Jun were seen at 30-34 cts/lb FOB USG for industrialand fiber grade.   Mid-Jul saw fiber grade contracts settle at 33.5 cts/lb FD USG, whilespot prices for A-F and industrial grades around 33-35 cts/lb FOB USG.Strong demand and low inventories forced some producers in late Jul to buymaterial in the spot market.   A traditional seasonal decrease in A-F grade demand saw a 'lull' indemand. By late Aug spot prices for industrial and A-F grades fell to 29-31cts/lb FOB USG, while demand for fiber grade continued strong. The decreasein demand also allowed for a slight buildup in inventories.   Mid-Sep saw producers cautiously building up stocks, recalling theprevious winter's mildness.   Throughout Q4 sources reported generally less-than-dynamic A-F gradesales. In mid-Oct there was talk of Mexican and Venezuelan industrial gradematerial available at 26-27 cts/lb FOB USG, but few buyers were seen. Somesources believe the A-F grade buying season will continue into 1996, asconsumers maintain low stocks.   For propylene, the year began with contract prices for all grades in thehigh teens and low 20 cts/lb range.   Jan contracts for all grades settled up 1 ct/lb from Dec, with polymergrade at 21.75 cts/lb, chemical grade at 20.25 cts/lb and refinery grade at18.50-19 cts/lb. Spot polymer grade showed a 10 ct/lb premium abovecontract, chemical grade had a 2-4 ct/lb premium, but spot refinery gradewas about 1-1.50 cts/lb below contract.   Some tightness in supply was noted in the market when several producerstook turnarounds at FCC units along the Gulf Coast early in the year.Strong demand and scheduled outages kept market snug for several months,with producers having little opportunity to build inventories.   Alkylation values for refinery grade propylene were at 7-8 cts/lb inFeb, with values depressed by low gasoline prices. Values of 6-7 cts/lb inlate Mar continued to encourage producers to sell refinery grade on thespot market where it commanded a higher value. Excess refinery gradematerial was entering the US Gulf from California, the Midwest and SouthLouisiana.   By early Mar, producers were building inventories. Contract and spotprices slipped for refinery grade propylene by early Jun to 15.75-18.25cts/lb and 15.00-15.50 cts/lb FOB USG respectively, due to overproductionand low alkylation values. However, contract prices for polymer andchemical grade had added 1 ct/lb in Feb, Mar and Apr to 24.75 cts/lb forpolymer grade and 23.25 cts/lb for chemical grade for Apr.   Although an increase was passed in Apr, discussions were drawn out dueto the levelling off in ethylene prices and the decline in the refinerygrade market. Discussions for Apr included talk of a 0.5-1 ct/lb decreasein prices. However, after the 1 ct/lb increase in Apr, consumers settledMay as a rollover.   By mid-May, outages at several Gulf Coast fluid catalytic cracking unitshelped firm the market, while alkylation values as high as 15-17 cts/lbwere attributed to the onset of the driving season.   Due to excess supply of polymer grade material, spot prices fell to25-26 cts/lb FOB USG for polymer grade and 23-24 cts/lb FOB USG forchemical grade in Jun. Demand for the higher grade propylene was softer dueto falling polypropylene demand.   By mid-Jul the weak polymer market was also affecting refinery gradepropylene producers who upgrade material via splitting, and spot prices forall grades had fallen below contract prices by late Aug. Polymer grade spotwas at 20.50- 21.50 cts/lb FOB USG, while chemical grade at 19.50- 20.50cts/lb and spot refinery grade at 14.25-15.00 cts/lb ex-tank FOB USG.   Inventories for Q2 totaled 965-mil lbs, while production totaled 6.7-billbs. By late Sep, spot prices had declined further due to ample supply andlower demand for all three grades. All spot prices had fallen considerablybelow contracts prices by the end of Q3.   Although some US sources reported settling Oct polymer and chemicalgrade propylene down 1.5 cts/lb, Nov down 1.5 cts/lb and Dec down 1 ct/lb,the Dec contract price for both grades seemed to be very much in questionby the year's end.   One source reported discussions were divided between a large number ofproducers who contended Dec should be down 1 ct/lb, and some consumers whocontended it should be down 1.5 cts/lb.   By early Dec, polymer grade was heard in the pipeline at 11 cts/lb and10 cts/lb in railcars. Chemical grade was heard at 10 cts/lb in pipelineand 9.5 cts/lb in railcar. Refinery grade propylene also dropped tosignificant lows. Its Dec contract price settled between 9.00 and 9.50cts/lb, while Dec spot was reported between 8.50 and 9.00 cts/lb.   Butadiene contracts began the year settling up 1 ct to 25 cts/lb, whilespot prices were at 25-27 cts/lb CIF USG. Jan 1 inventories totalled221-mil lbs/yr, up 39-mil lbs/yr from Dec 1994.   Feb 1 inventories totaled 229-mil lbs/yr, while spot market at 23-24cts/lb CIF USG. Producers that were seeking to build inventories inanticipation of turnarounds allowed stocks to total 235-mil lbs on Mar 1,and reported approaching capacity at storage tanks by early Mar.   After rolling over in Feb and Mar at 25 cts/lb, butadiene contractssettled down 2 cts to 23 cts/lb in Apr. Apr 1 inventories totaled 225-millbs/yr, which was the first decline in stock levels since Nov 1994. Spotprices in mid-Apr were at 22-23 cts/lb CIF USG.   May 1 inventories totaled 249-mil lbs, while spot prices were pegged at20-22 cts/lb CIF USG. However, the industry was at odds over the reportingof Jun 1 inventories at 145-mil lbs. The decrease was due to downtime atethylene and butadiene units, decreased imports and high freight rates.Contracts settled at a rollover at 23 cts/lb in both May and Jun.   Spot prices in early Jul were pegged at 23-24 cts/lb CIF USG. Jul 1inventories rebounded somewhat to 166-mil lbs/yr, but this figure waswithout the participation of one large consumer that took issue with theJun 1 figure.   Jul contract prices settled late in the month at 25 cts/lb, while Augcontracts settled unchanged. Aug 1 inventories totaled 173-mil lbs. In Sepbutadiene derivative markets reported weakness, though this was offset bythe turnaround of two major butadiene plants. Sep 1 inventories totaled200-mil lbs, which was ascribed to expected turnarounds in Oct and toseveral tanks taking on extra material for operators whose other tanks wereout of service.   Contracts rolled over in Sep at 25 cts/lb. Spot transactions wereminimal due to high inventories. By the end of Sep, spot butadiene waspegged at 23-23.5 cts/lb CIF USG.   In late Oct, Lyondell, Texas Petrochemical and Shell nominated the Novcontract price at 23 cts/lb, down 2 cts from Oct. The downward push came ata time of high stocks.   From Jul to Oct, consultants Hodson & Co reported a sustained rise in USbutadiene inventories. Oct 1 inventories were reported at 226-mil lbs, anincrease of 13% over Sep.   As consumers sought to work off butadiene bought at 25 cts/lb, the spotmarket seemed to vanish by mid-Nov. Aside from the uneconomic pricing ofimported material, sources also said storage was often an issue.   As the year closed, high inventories continued to weigh on the market,and there was unconfirmed talk of at least a large consumer demanding yetanother price decrease for Jan of 2 cts/lb, pushing the contract down to 19cts/lb.   In early Jan, one trader heard reports that three producers are indeedsettling at this level. Two producers have reportedly settled 19 cts/lb forJan, while a third has granted a 'temporary volume allowance', in thetrader's words, bringing the net contract price to 19 cts/lb, butpreserving 21 cts/lb as a basis for Feb negotiations.Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Spot US Ethylene, Propylene Prices 1995Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S INTERNATIONAL PETROCHEMICAL RPTS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996   Vol. 15, NoJAPAN'S SHIN-ETSU CHEMICAL CO LTD   Japan's Shin-Etsu Chemical Co Ltd plans to construct its second PVCplant in the US with a capacity of 400,000 mt/yr, local press reported.Shin-Etsu reportedly plans to startup the PVC plant in early 1998.

With the breathtakingrevelations of enzymes, receptors, and genes as new potentialtargets for therapeutic interventions being made, Big Pharma nowfinds it obliged to team with combinatorial chemistry firms just tokeep up with all the exploding opportunities. To be sure, not allthe potential therapeutic molecules are chiral, but the majorityare so.Stereochemical technology has applications also innonpharmaceutical areas, such as pesticides, flavors, aromas, dyes,liquid crystals, and polymers. The new year is not yet the timewhen we will see maturation in the pharmaceutical sector, however,and these other fields will likely remain minor outlets, exceptperhaps for liquid-crystal applications, which will continue to besignificant. Will chiral technology firms miss the "ground floor"opportunities to be had in these other areas, or are their platessimply too full as it is?The unfolding year will undoubtedly yield new, dazzling feats inthe synthetic duplication of natural molecules.  Most of them,however, will likely continue to be marvels of academicaccomplishment but will be commercially inviable because of pooryields, impractical complexity, or costly raw materials.  Theywill, though, point up new possibilities for asymmetric chemicalcatalysts and resolving agents.Biocatalysts -- live microbes and refined enzymes -- will probablycarve out significant new roles for themselves in 1996. Theyalready have an important place in stereochemical technology, butorganic chemists are beginning to look more favorably on them asuseful tools, in part because genetic engineering, proteinengineering, and new screening technologies are delivering up newerand better enzyme performances.Synthesis and separation will continue to be opposing strategiesfor chiral molecule manufacture this new year. But companiesincreasingly see the virtue of combining the two in a way thatmakes both economically feasible and efficient.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 19965.5 Million ChiRexShares OfferedSepracor Inc.

The company will concentrate ondevelopment of technologies for low-cost production of generic bulkactives, rather than manufacturing the materials itself.Naproxen is one of the largest selling enantiomeric drugs, havingworldwide sales in the prescription market of about $1 billion,perhaps $300 million in the U.S. alone.  Sales should go evenhigher now that the over-the-counter market is being tapped.Syntex is the major producer of naproxen and is its patent holder.Naproxen is coming off patent, however, and Syntex has collaboratedwith Procter & Gamble to market an OTC naproxen under the nameAleve.  Lederle intends to enter the market with a generic version.Chemically, naproxen is 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionic acid.  Itis, therefore, a chiral 2-substituted propionic compound, acharacteristic shared with the profens.  The substance is marketedas the single S isomer, which has 28 times the biological activityof the other isomer.Chiroscience intends to license its technologies or use contractmanufacturers for supply of bulk actives, which the company willsell to generic drug formulators.  The company will use atechnology licensed from DuPont (Wilmington, DE  19810; Tel:302/695-5234,  Fax: 302/695-5286), using a catalyst for asymmetrichydrogenation, to produce s-naproxen.  Other processes will bedeveloped using Chiroscience's own enzymatic catalyst technology.Alan Shaw, sales director for technical services, says his companybelieves it can significantly reduce process costs whilemaintaining normal margins due to its chiral technology know-how.Chiroscience currently provides chiral building blocks as well asactive ingredients for new chemical entities being developed byother pharmaceutical firms.  The other component of the company'sbusiness focuses on developing pharmaceuticals for marketing on itsown.  One category of pharmaceuticals in its development portfoliois identified as "fast-track single isomers," which are single-enantiomer versions of drugs already on the market.Chiroscience estimates that the current worldwide market for bulkS-naproxen is around 2,000 tons per year, worth $200 million.  Thiscould rise, however, to 3,000 tons, worth $300 million, by the year2000, mainly as a result of introduction of OTC naproxen in WesternEurope.Stereochemical Stock Watch(At close, Jan. 2, 1996)The big winner in our portfolio this month is Chiron, on the newsthat its beta-interferon for multiple sclerosis has received afavorable nod by an FDA committee.

Abbott reports recentresults from a clinical trial showing this protease inhibitorsignificantly reduced plasma viremia and elevated counts of CD4lymphocytes.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (40 Allston St., Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel:617/576-3111, Fax: 617/576-2109), developing its own HIV proteaseinhibitor, reports that its partner, Glaxo Wellcome (Berkeley Ave.,Greenford, Middlesex UB6 OHE, U.K.; Fax: 071/493-4809), hascommenced Phase I/II clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe. Thiseffort is being supported also by Kissei Pharmaceutical (Matsumoto,Japan).Although monotherapy with one compound or another does a reasonablejob at keeping the virus at bay, it seems probable that combinationtherapy with a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor and a proteaseinhibitor will constitute the future direction of treatment. Thevirus may develop a resistance toward one drug type, but it facesa greater obstacle to its replication when confronted with bothtypes. It seems possible that while the RTIs will rise to perhaps$500 million by 2000, for an average annual growth rate of 1.9% inthis five-year period, the PIs will rise rapidly from zero to $500million themselves, before settling down to a more normal growthrate.Numerous other drugs, appproved or experimental, also treat AIDS orAIDS-associated conditions. The short list includes gamma-globulin,alpha-interferon, ganciclovir, fluconazole, pentamidine,erythropoietin, foscarnet, itraconazole, atovaquone, rifabutin,dronabinol, megestrol acetate, trimetrexate, clarithromycin,trimethoprim, doxorubicin, and amphotericin B (see table)To these can be added target-specific antibodies, antigen-basedvaccines, immune-boosting cytokines, immunomodutar chemcals, andherbal medicines.

(33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA  01752;  Tel:508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) has been granted its eleventh andtwelfth U.S. patents for Improved Chemical Entities (ICE).U.S. Patent 5,470,868 covers the use of R-ondansetron as anantiemetic.  Marketed by Glaxo Wellcome (Lansdowne House, BerkeleySquare, London W1X 6BZ, U.K.; Tel: 1714934060) as Zofran, racemicondansetron already is a leading antiemetic used to treat nauseaand vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatments and surgery.Sepracor estimates that emesis occurs in 70% of the 3.6 millionchemotherapy episodes and 30% of the 23 million surgical proceduresperformed in the U.S. each year.  The sales of Zofran in 1994 wereapproximately $600 million.Despite its effectiveness for emesis, racemic ondansetron has showna meaningful incidence of adverse side effects such as tachycardia,angina, and electrocardiographic alterations, including second-degree heart block most prevalent in nonchemotherapy uses.Sepracor believes that the single isomer of ondansetron provides anopportunity for development of a safer, more effective antiemetic.Preclinical trials have indicated that R-ondansetron has superiorantiemetic activity compared with the racemic product.In preclinical studies, Sepracor has discovered that a purifiedversion of itraconazole retains full antifungal activity withreduced risk of drug-drug interaction.  Marketed by JanssenPharmaceuticals Inc. (1000 E. Garvey Ave. S., West Covina, CA91790; Tel: 818/918-8510, Fax: 818/918-2862) as Sporanox,itraconazole is a leading antifungal agent.  The product had 1994worldwide sales of $276 million and is protected until June 1998under its composition-of-matter patent.Sporanox is a complex molecule consisting of several isomers.Despite its effectiveness for treating fungal and yeast infections,Sporanox carries a warning label about certain drug interactionsthat cause adverse effects, such as cardiac arrhythmia, ventriculartachycardia, and torsades de pointes.  Other adverse effectsinclude liver toxicity, nausea, vomiting, and hypersensitivityreactions.  U.S. Patent 5,474,997 claims pharmaceuticalcompositions containing (2R,4S)-itraconazole is a way of treatinglocal and systemic fungal and yeast infections while avoiding theconcomitant liability of adverse effects associated with the drug.David S. Barlow, president of Sepracor Pharmaceuticals, said thatthe improvement in safety profile may ultimately help enable theswitch of itraconazole from a prescription drug to an over-the-counter product. That would help extend the franchise for the drugand expand its market.Sepracor additionally seeks to commercialize norastemizole, athird-generation antihistamine and potentially improved allergytherapy. Norastemizole is an active metabolite of astemizole, thenonsedating antihistamine marketed by Janssen under the brand nameHismanal. The astemizole product may produce cardiac arrhythmia,however.  Preclinical studies by Sepracor indicate thatnorastemizole may avoid this side effect.  The fact thatastemizole, as well as norastemizole, are nonchiral entities pointsup that Sepracor does not deal exclusively with chiral molecules.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996(R)-LomefloxacinEliminates HeadachesJames W. Young of Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA01752;  Tel: 508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) has been issued apatent for methods and compositions that treat bacterial infectionusing optically pure (R)-lomefloxacin (U. S. 5,476,854). Opticalpurity is important since certain isomers may actually bedeleterious rather than simply inert. For example, it has beensuggested that the D-enantiomer of thalidomide was a safe andeffective sedative when prescribed for the control of morningsickness during pregnancy, and the corresponding L-enantiomer wasa potent teratogen.It has been discovered that the optically pure (R)-isomer oflomefloxacin is effective in treating infection in a human whileavoiding adverse effects associated with the administration ofracemic lomefloxacin, including headache, stomach discomfort,gastrointestinal disorders, hypoglycemia, renal and hepaticdysfunction, allergic reactions and respiratory distress, andarthropathy, such as cartilage lesions and erosion andabnormalities in bone growth in immature patients.Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e. theyhave the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. Indescribing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or Rand S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the moleculeabout its chiral center(s).  A specific stereoisomer may bereferred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers isoften called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture ofenantiomers if referred to as a racemic mixture.Stereochemical purity is of importance in the field ofpharmaceuticals, where 12 of the 20 most prescribed drugs exhibitchirality. A case in point is provided by the L-form of the b-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, which is known to be 100times more potent than the D-enantiomer.Sepracor's development includes methods for treating the above-described conditions in a human while avoiding the adverse effectsthat are associated with the racemic mixture of lomefloxacin byadministering the optically pure (R)-isomer of lomefloxacin.Lomefloxacin is currently available commercially in Argentina,Japan, Mexico, and other countries in Asia and Eastern Europe asthe racemic mixture.  Racemic lomefloxacin, having the chemicalname 1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxo-3-quinolinecar-boxylic acid, belongs to the quinoline class ofantibiotics. The quinoline antibiotics, in general, exhibit a broadspectrum of antibacterial action, demonstrating effectivenessagainst both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains.Quinoline antibiotics have been shown to be effective in treatinginfections of the respiratory, genito-urinary, and gastrointestinaltracts.  Racemic lomefloxacin exhibits a broad spectrum ofantibacterial action, demonstrating effectiveness against bothgram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Lomefloxacin hasshown to be more effective against gram-negative bacteria.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Ketoprofen GainsMarket ShareThe chiral drug, ketoprofen, sold under the Orudis KT brand name bythe Whitehall-Robins Healthcare Division of American Home Products(5 Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940; Tel: 201/660-5000), hasachieved a 3.7% share of the $2.75 billion OTC pain reliever marketin the U.S., according to A.C. Nielson. The survey covers just thetwo-month period ended Dec. 16, since introduction of the producton Nov. 9. The share figure translates into sales of $102,000,which comes to $610,000 on an annualized basis, although it's tooearly to foretell the actual full-year performance.To achieve even this modest share so quickly, Whitehall-Robinsundertook the largest overnight delivery of new medication toretail stores it has ever made.  In a 24-hour, nationwidedistribution effort, more than 20,000 trucks were mobilized todeliver the Orudis KT to more than 30,000 retail outlets. Retailersapparently confirm the product's market acceptance. Says JohnSpellman, analgesic category manager of American Drug Stores,"Orudis KT has made a surprisingly strong, early impact on theover-the-counter pain-relief category at [the company's] stores."Meanwhile, the consumer Care Division of Bayer (1 Mellon BankCenter, 500 Grant St., Pittsburgh, PA 15219; Tel: 412/394-5500,Fax: 412/394-5586) has entered the arena, with its Actron brand ofketoprofen. Although the tablet has the same strength as AmericanHome Product's Orudis, Bayer's advertising campaign will emphasizeActron's smaller tablet size. Promotion of Actron will includenewspaper displays in the top 20 markets and televisionadvertising. As Gary Balkema, president of Bayer Consumer Caresays, "The powerful medicine in Actron delivers safe and effectiverelief of many types of pain.  And its unique size offers a new,tangible benefit for consumers: it's very easy to swallow."Ketoprofen chemically is in the same class as ibuprofen andnaproxen, a 2-substituted propionic acid that gives the moleculeits chiral character.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Motilin Focus ofTwo-Pronged EffortMotilin is a recently discovered peptide hormone found in thegastrointestinal tract and has a molecular weight of around 2,700daltons.  Its function is to stimulate gastric movement.  Effortsto imitate and to suppress motilin's action is the subject of drugdevelopment by several companies.In one recent development, Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho (35 Higashi,Sotobori-cho, Higashi-ku. Nagoya 461, Japan; Fax: 052/951-7650), arelatively small pharmaceutical firm, has developed an orallyabsorbable form of motilin. Instead of the natural molecule, Sanwauses a derivative, L-leucine-13-motilin-homoserine.  The agent'sformulation includes a special surfactant that includes a bilesalt, a saponin, and a polyethylene glycol/higher alcohol ether.The surfactant acts as an inhibitor of peptide cleaving enzymes.Too much gastrointestinal activity can be as bad as too little, andit commonly manifests itself as "nervous stomach" -- diarrhea andthe like. The pharmaceutical division of BOC's subsidiary, Ohmeda(110 Allen Road, Liberty Corner, NJ 07938; Tel: 908/647-9200, Fax:908/647-9245) has invented motilin analogs that antagonize thehormone's receptor and thereby inhibits gastrointestinal motoractivity.The analogs are optically active isomers of the amino acids thatmake up motilin, but some have the D instead of the natural Lconfiguration, e.g. D-arginine, D-lysine, D-ornithine, D-glutamine,D-asparagine, or D-alanine. Unnatural amino acids also may be partof the composition, e.g. D-2,4-diaminobutyric acid, ahalophenylalanine, and cyclohexylalanine.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Ergo Uses Ergotfor DiabetesErgo Science Corp. (Boston, MA; Tel: 617/241-6816) finds thatbromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid derivative having five chiralcenters, can benefit in the treatment of Type II diabetes.  Theformulated product, brand-named Ergoset, is currently in Phase IIIclinical trials.In an animal study using seasonally obese, hyperinsulinemic Syrianhamsters, a carefully timed administration of bromocriptineproduced a significant reduction in noctural lipolysis and hepaticglucose production accompanied by a 75% decrease in circulatinginsulin and improved daytime glucose tolerance.  Timedbromocriptine may improve glucose tolerance by inhibiting lipolysisand free fatty acid oxidation through a central and possiblyperipheral effect that increases the ratio of dopamine tonoradrenaline activity. An increasing body of evidence points tothe influence of circadian rhythm on human metabolism.Bromocriptine already has medical use as an anti-Parkinson'sdisease drug, e.g. Sandoz's Parlodel, where the substance acts asa dopamine receptor agonist. The substance also inhibits thesecretion of prolactin, a hormone that stimulates milk production.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Enantiomeric SertralineSynthesized by PfizerPfizer markets sertraline under the brand name Zoloft.  It is anantidepressant drug and, in fact, is one of the top-selling ones,with worldwide sales in the area of $720 million annually.The company has devised a new multistep process for synthesizingsertraline that involves first synthesizing the (4S) enantiomer of4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-1(2H)-naphthalenone in high opticalpurity. The process starts with the familiar 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-ketobutanoic acid, then proceeds through anesterification with isopropyl or tert-butyl alcohol, a reduction ofthe keto to hydroxy (creating the 4R configuration), and ultimatelyyielding the key (4S) naphthalenone intermediate.Subsequent transformations of the intermediate finally yield cis-(1S)(4S)-N-methyl-4-(3-,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3-4-tetrahydro-1-naphthaleneamine, in other words, sertraline.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SmithKline ProducesCamptothecin AnalogsCamptothecin is an alkaloid originating from the Chinese tree,Camptotheca acuminata, and chemically it is 4-ethyl-4-hydroxy-1H-pyrano-[3',4':6,7]indolizinol[1,2-b]quinoline-3,14(4H, 12H)-dione.The substance has anticancer activity by virtue of its acting as aninhibitor of topoisomerase I, also called "DNA-relaxing enzyme."This enzyme uncoils double-helix DNA, the first step in replicationof the genetic material during the process of cellularproliferation.SmithKline Beecham (1 Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, PA 19101; Tel:215/751-4000) is clinically evaluating camptothecin relatives forbreast and colon cancers, and one such compound has the designationSKF-104864. The company describes a process for the asymmetrictotal synthesis of camptothecin analogs.In the process, a cis-dioxolanone having the same desired absoluteconfiguration as the end compound is converted to a diester in away that conserves the chirality.  This substance then is convertedto one bearing either a good leaving group, a cyano, a carboxylicacid, or an N-aryl carboxylic amide.  This is converted to acompound incorporating a propargyl or substituted propargyl, whichfinally is converted to the end camptothecin analog.The chief rival to SB in this arena is Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, whichhas in clinical development a camptothecin analog, calledirinotecan and  brand-named Campto, the company licensed fromYakult Honsha.  The latter also licensed Upjohn, which uses thebrand name Camptosar for the same compound.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Oxazolidinones ShowDiabetes PotentialCelgene (7 Powder Horn Drive, Warren, NJ 07059; Tel: 908/271-1001,Fax: 908/271-4184) sees potential in oxazolidinones as therapeuticagents for diabetes and hyperglycemia. The company developed astereopreferential synthesis of the (R,R) diastereoisomers of 3-(1-phenylprop-2-yl)-5-phenyloxazolidin-2-ones as intermediates for thefinal compounds.The method starts with a reduction of the addition salt of an (R)-N-protected-N-phenylcarboxymethyl-1-phenylprop-2-ylamine to form asecondary alcohol of predominantly the desired enantiomericconfiguration at the two chiral centers. The next step is a removalof the protecting group that forms a secondary amine.  Then thesecondary amine is reacted with a carbonyl source. The overallprocess results in a chemical purity and an optical purity both inexcess of 99%.Chemical drugs other than insulin for the control of diabetes andhyperglycemia has combined worldwide sales of perhaps $3.5 billionannually, at present. The major fraction of these sales come fromsulfonylurea drugs. They are under challenge by new contendersbecause of their tendency to produce hypoglycemia, a seriousproblem of its own.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996UOP ProvidesGood YieldDavid W. House of UOP (E. Algonquin Road, Des Plaines, IL  60017;Tel: 708/391-3963,  Fax: 708/391-3804) has worked out a way toconveniently racemize benzyl alcohols having a chiral center at thebenzylic carbon by treatment with solid acids that are stronglyacidic cation-exchange materials (U.S. Patent 5,476,964).It has been known for some time that for medicinals having at leastone chiral center the pharmacological effectiveness of theenantiomers of the racemic mixture may substantially differ.Although the recognition of the desirability of using thepharmacologically and pharmaceutically more acceptable enantiomeris old, nonetheless the use of optically pure medicinals generallyis relatively new, simply because of the difficulty and cost ofresolution of the racemic mixture and/or the difficulty and cost ofasymmetric synthesis of the desired enantiomer.With modern chemical advances, especially in asymmetric synthesis,has come both an increase in the feasibility of selectivelypreparing the more acceptable enantiomer of a given chiralmedicinal, as well as increasing pressure on the pharmaceuticalindustry to make available only that enantiomer. An instructiveexample, pertinent to the subject matter of this invention, is theclass of serotonin-uptake inhibitors exemplified by fluoxetine(whose racemate is available as Prozac), tomoxetine, andnisoxetine.Enantioselective synthesis depends on chiral reagents of highenantiomeric purity that can be quite expensive. Consequently,another general approach is based on the efficient resolution of anearly precursor, used as a raw starting material in synthesis, withhigh enantiomeric purity, followed by subsequent conventionalsynthetic techniques that maintain high enantiomeric purity inintermediates through final product formation.When one enantiomer is more desirable than the other in practiceonly the more desirable enantiomer will be utilized in subsequentsynthesis. Unless one is willing to accept the economic burden ofdiscarding the less desirable (or even undesirable) enantiomer --which is half of the starting material -- it is imperative tosomehow recycle the undesired enantiomer. This application isdirected precisely to this need to afford a cost-effective solutionto the preceding problem.Racemization of benzyl alcohols may be effected generally in therange from 20-150C in aqueous or partly aqueous systems incombination with a water-miscible organic solvent to improvesolubility of the alcohol. Similar racemizations may be effectedfor benzyl ethers and esters. This process is valuable forrecycling of unwanted enantiomers obtained in the resolution ofracemic mixtures.   The purpose of this invention is to racemizedbenzylic alcohols, ethers, and esters, especially in a continuousprocess, with high specificity and good yield.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Supercritical FluidsYield Higher PurityChemists at Duke University (Durham, NC) have teamed up with LosAlamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, NM) to get highenantiomeric purities without resorting to toxic solvents.  Thescientists find that they are able to get as great or greaterenantiomeric excesses by catalytic hydrogenation in supercriticalcarbon dioxide as in organic solvents.Above its critical temperature of 31C, nonflammable, non-toxiccarbon dioxide is compressible to densities of 0.5 g/ml, meaningthat users can vary solvent properties by manipulating pressure.Organic chemistry professor Mark J. Burk and coworkers reported inthe Journal of the American Chemical Society [117, 8277, 1995] onthe hydrogenation of substituted a-acetaminoacrylic acid tosubstituted N-acetylalanines in carbon dioxide at 5,000 psig totalpressure and 40C with an asymmetric diphosphine-rhodium catalyst.The team was able to get 88.4% enantiomeric excess of a-acetamin-oisobutyric acid, the highest ever achieved from the acrylic acidprecursor.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Fredericamycin AIs Scripps FirstScientists at the Scripps Research Institute (Claremont, CA) haveachieved the first total synthesis of both enantiomers of theantitumor-anitbiotic agent fredericamycin A. While the naturalproduct exhibits potent in vitro cytotoxic activity and has shownantitumor activity in vivo, not much is known about its site ofaction or the structural features responsible for its activity.  Inan effort to identify the origin of its biological properties, DaleBoger, Ottmar Hter, Kapiamba Mbiya, and Minsheng Zhang of Scriptsaccomplished a convergent total synthesis of its two enantiomers.As reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117,11839, 1995], the scientists used a Michael addition to add the DEring system to an F ring precursor, a benzannulation reaction toconstruct the AB moiety, and then an aldol closure reaction toclose the C ring in between.This research complements earlier attempts at total syntheses ofracemic fredericamycin A by other groups.  Boger and coworkersfound that natural fredericamycin A and its enantiomer exhibitessentially equivalent cytotoxic activity.  This comparablecytotoxic potency should permit the use of the two enantiomers indistinguishing the site and potential mechanism of action offredericamycin A.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996USC CharacterizesStable TetracationChemists at the University of Southern California (Los Angeles, CA)have prepared and characterized the first stable tetrahedrallyoriented tetracation.  The synthesis was carried out bypostdoctoral associate Nicholas Head, working with chemistryprofessors G. K. Surya Prakash and George Olah.As reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117,12005, 1995], an adamantane tetrahedrally substituted with fourester groups was first converted to a tetraol.  The tetraol is thenionized to the tetracation under superacid conditions at -80C.The tetracation is stable up to -40C.Tetracations are very rare and long-lived tetracarbocations thatwere previously unknown.  According to Prakash, the researchershope to use the tetracation to catalyze the polymerization of othermolecules to yield hyper-branched polymers.  They see the potentialfor using the tetracation as a building block in the constructionof self-assembling supramolecular structures.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996PerSeptive IntroducesNew PNA ChemistryPeptide and oligonucleotide synthesis chemistry comprise a bedrockof chiral technology applications, for both research molecules andpotential therapeutics.  A new development is the emergence of"peptide nucleic acids (PNA)," a hybrid type that uses a peptide-like backbone with nucleotide pendants. Such hybrid molecules havethe complementary binding capabilities of oligonucleotides fornucleic acid sequences, but resist the degradative action ofnuclease enzymes.PerSeptive Biosystems (500 Old Connecticut Path, Framingham, MA01701; Tel: 508/383-7700, Fax: 508/383-7851) introduces a new lineof products for the synthesis of peptide nucleic acids.Applications include affinity purification, in situ  hybridization,enhanced PCR, improved Southern blots, single-point mutationanalysis, and antisense research.The chemistry employs new monomers with Fmoc (9-flurenylmethoxycarbonyl) and Bhoc (benzhydryloxycarbonyl)protecting groups. Syntheses are run on solid-phase supports usingmild conditions and automated instrumentation. PerSeptive hasapplied for a patent on its new class of PNA synthons. Says MichaelEghold, director of PNA research at PerSeptive, "PNA is now beingused in over 100 labs worldwide as a tool for molecular biology anddiagnostic research and functions in very different ways from anyprevious molecule."Having taken over the Biosearch Milligen business from Millipore inAugust 1994, PerSeptive is now the second leading supplier ofmaterials for peptide and oligonucleotide chemical synthesis.

Its production makes use of an asymmetric bioreduction, bywhich 6-bromotetralone converts to (S)-6-bromo-2tetraol.  Thereductive activity is furnished by the yeast Trichosporon captatumMY-1890 (ATCC 74312) which, along with the substrate forconversion, is cultivated in a medium incorporating glycerol, soypeptone, and yeast extract.  An optical purity greater than 98% isobtained.Arrhythmia is an irregularity of the heart beat. A cluster ofspecialized cells, located at the junction of the superior venacava and the high right atrium, called the sinoatrial (or sinus)node, forms the pacemaker of the heart. These cells produce arhythmic electrical discharge that initiates the regularcontraction of the heart muscle, which in turn forces (pumps) thecirculation of blood. The sinoatrial cells are modulated byautonomic nerves and by circulating catecholamines.Antiarrhythmic drugs to regularize the heart beat had worldwidesales in 1995 of about $900 million.

The enzymatic epoxidationprocess is advantageous in that it provides high yields of thechiral epoxides of the compounds with high optical purity.The invention is a novel process for preparing a chiral epoxideand/or a (+)-trans dihydroxy compound.  The process comprises thestep of treating a compound with an enzyme or microorganism capableof catalyzing the stereoselective epoxidation of the compounds toform the chiral epoxide or the stereoselective hydroxylation toform the chiral dihydroxy compound.It has been found that in the presence of one or more epoxidizingenzymes or microorganisms producing epoxidizing enzymes, thestereoselective epoxidation of the compounds is achieved. When thereaction is carried out at ambient temperature, for example, anoptical purity of greater than about 80% may be obtained with areaction yield of greater than about 50%. Preferably, an opticalpurity of greater than 85% with a reaction yield of greater thanabout 60% may be obtained.In addition to the chiral epoxide, the method comprises thestereoselective hydroxylation of compounds to produce the chiraltrans-dihydroxy compounds.  The chiral dihydroxy compounds may beprepared from the racemic trans diols by treatment of the racemictrans diols with lipase, esterase, or microorganism capable ofsupplying lipase or esterase.Any enzyme or microorganism having the ability to catalyze thestereoselective epoxidation or stereoselective hydroxylation of thecompounds as described may be employed in the processes. Two ormore -- as well as single -- species of microorganism may beemployed.  Various enzymes, regardless of origin or purity, aresuitable for usefor example, the enzymes may be in the form ofanimal or plant enzymes or mixtures thereof, cells ofmicroorganisms, crushed cells, extracts of cells, or of syntheticorigin.  The use of genetically engineered organisms is beingcontemplated.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Thermostable EnzymesAre EnantioselectiveA startup biotechnology company, ThermoGen (2201 W.

Oxirane alcoholsprepared according to the invention are distinguished by highenantiomeric purity.For almost 150 years, chemists have endeavored to produce chiralcompounds in the form of largely pure enantiomers, either bysynthesis of a single enantiomer or by separation of the twoenantiomers. Chiral compounds are in general optically active, i.e.they rotate the plane of polarized light by a certain amount. Thisamount is of the same magnitude for the two enantiomers but hasdifferent signs.Particularly in the field of biochemistry, it is known that onlyone of the two enantiomers usually shows a certain given activity,even when the two can have completely different activities. In manyother fields of chemistry and industry it is important to work withenantiomeric compounds that are as pure as possible. Examplesinclude plant-protection chemicals and ferroelectric liquidcrystals, i.e. those which contain chiral molecules and form tiltedsmectic phases.Clark and Lagerwall have been able to show that the use offerroelectric liquid-crystal systems in very thin cells leads tooptoelectric switching or indicating elements that, as comparedwith the conventional twisted nematic (TN) cells, have switchingtimes that are shorter by a factor of up to 1000.  The opticalswitching time of ferroelectric liquid-crystal systems depends onthe rotational viscosity of the system on the spontaneouspolarization and the electric field strength.It is also known to obtain pure enantiomers of compounds by addingseed crystals of the desired enantiomer to the solution of the twoenantiomers. This so-called spontaneous resolution of racematessucceeds only if the racemic mixture crystallizes as aconglomerate, i.e. as a mixture of crystals of one enantiomer ineach case, which is the case for only a few compounds.  It was agoal at Hoechst to provide a process to more easily obtain oxiranealcohols of an even higher purity of the enantiomers.Hoechst found, surprisingly, that oxirane alcohols withoutdetectable contamination by the other diastereomers or enantiomerscan be obtained by recrystallization in suitable solvents attemperatures that are just below the melting point of the oxiranealcohol. The interval between the melting point and the temperatureof the recrystallization can be the wider, the higher the meltingpoint of the compound.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Continuous SamplingElucidates AbsorptionsThe University of Kansas (Lawrence, KS) has developed an interfacefor use with a multiple-sample acquisition device and a capillaryelectrophoresis separation device (U.S. Patent 5,449,064). The useof continuous sampling can permit the user to better elucidate thepathways and kinetics of absorption of a particular compound ofinterest to determine how the compound is transformed within thebody and to determine the rate at which the compound is eliminatedfrom the living organism. This information is often necessary topermit the researcher to fully assess the safety of bothpharmaceutical and environmental compounds.One might desire information about the reaction of an analgesicchiral compound in a living organism. To determine this, a knownamount of the compound could be given to the organism, andcontinuous tissue samples (e.g., brain fluid) are obtained. Byanalyzing the brain fluid samples that were withdrawn at varioustime intervals after giving the analgesic to the animal, one couldobtain a great deal of information about the manner in which thespecific analgesic functioned within the living organism.By continuously obtaining samples, it is also possible to determinethe amount of time required to remove the particular analgesicsystem from the living organism. Knowing the rate of elimination ofthe analgesic can be especially important for enabling itsmanufacturer to either adjust the dosage or alter the drug (such asthrough micro encapsulation) to enable the drug to achieve a propertiter within the living organism for a proper time period.One goal when performing continuous or semi-continuous sampling isto improve the temporal resolution of the sampling and detectionprocess. Temporal resolution relates to the number of data pointsthat one can obtain over a given time span. Figures for temporalresolution are typically given in units of time span. To say thata particular experiment had a temporal resolution of 1 minute meansthat a data point was taken (or capable of being taken) eachminute. The factor limiting temporal resolution is the timerequired to accumulate and collect a sample of a size adequate forthe particular detection method being used in conjunction with thesampling.Methods for obtaining time-interval type, sequential multiple-sample chemical information from tissues of living systems haveusually involved either a postmortem analysis taken at several timepoints or the use of biosensors implanted in vivo. Postmortemanalyses typically require the use of a large number of animalswith only a single sample being taken from each animal. The "pseudocontinuity" of samples is achieved by taking the samples from thedifferent animals at different points in time.The use of postmortem analyses to construct a temporal plot ofchemical events is difficult and often provides ambiguous results.While several compounds can be determined at each time point (andhence from each sample), each animal can provide data for only asingle time point. It is therefore preferable in terms of both thequality of data obtained and the number of experimental animalsneeded that the entire time course (data set) be obtained from oneanimal by taking a large number of samples over a span of time.Although this can be accomplished through the use of a biosensor,biosensors suffer the drawback of providing less chemicalinformation since they are usually limited to monitoring only asingle chemical species.To overcome the sampling difficulties, some researchers use amicrodialysis sampling technique. Microdialysis sampling isaccomplished by implanting a microdialysis probe that consists ofa small, semi-permeable membrane fiber at the site of interest.This fiber is slowly perfused with a sampling solution. Thesemipermeable microdialysis membrane allows certain molecules ofinterest to pass from the animal into the sampling solution.Small molecules in the extra-cellular space can diffuse into themicrodialysis membrane fiber and are swept away by the samplingsolution to be collected for analysis. Microdialysis probes can beimplanted in many tissues with minimal discomfort to theexperimental animal.  A limitation of microdialysis has been thelimited temporal resolution that has been achievable to date. Whilemicrodialysis is a continuous sampling technique, it is typicallycoupled to a separation method that requires discrete samples.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Beckman's NewAnalysis MethodThe rapid analysis-time characteristic of capillary electrophoresis(CE) has allowed Beckman Instruments (2500 Harbor Blvd., Fullerton,CA  92634; Tel: 800/742-2345 or 714/871-4848,  Fax: 714/870-8083)to develop an easy-to-use, ultrafast chiral separation method forthe analysis of optically active drugscyclodextrin-array chiralanalysis.Andras Guttman, Anthony Aumatel, Sandy Brunet, and Nelson Cooke ofBeckman reported the results of separations utilizing the newmethod in American Laboratory [27, 18, 1995]. Earlier, STN(November 1995) reported on Beckman's integrated capilllaryelectrophoresis system that uses special software for computer-based analysis of the data.Cyclodextrin-mediated capillary electrophoresis of enantiomers wasfirst introduced by employing several native cyclodextrinsentrapped in polyacrylamide gels.  Later, a similar methodology inan open tubular-separation mode was applied.  Natural a-, b-, andg-cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides of 6, 7, and 8glucopyranose units, respectively.  The diameter and volume of theDC cavity are determined by the number of glucose units in the CDring.The most energetically stable form of this ring structure resemblesa truncated cone in aqueous solution with the linking glycosidicand glucopyranose oxygens pointing inward and the C-6 hydroxylsopposite to the C-2 and C-3 hydroxyls.  As a result, the chemicalcharacteristics of the cavity are determined by the hydrogensprojecting into the cavity and the nonbonding pair of electronscontributed by each of the ring-forming oxygens.To obtain chiral separation with CD, it is necessary for differentinteractions to take place between the enantiomer and the CD.These interactions are as follows:  electrostatic, dipole-dipole,inductive, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions.  If atleast one of these interactions is stereochemically dependent,chiral separation of an enantiomeric solute is possible.Recently, a rational approach to predicting the electrophoreticmobility differences for enantiomers of weak acids and bases in CEusing different natural and derivatized CDs as chiral selectors wasintroduced.  Three types of CD-based chiral CE separations wereidentified, differentiated by the selective interaction of theionic/nonionic forms of the enantiomer.In desionoselective separation, selective interaction occurs onlybetween the nondissociated form of the enantiomer and the CD.  Inionoselective separation, selective interaction occurs only withthe dissociated form of the enantiomer.  In duoselectiveseparation, selective interaction occurs with both the charged anduncharged forms of the enantiomer.CD-array chiral analysis uses an array of chiral selectors, such asb-, g-, hydroxypropyl-b-, and dimethyl-b-DCs, in variousconcentrations to accommodate different types of solutes.  Afterthe application of the CD array on CE, the appropriate CD type isusually identified in conjunction with the suitable pH.  Other,more typical CE separation parameters, such as field strength andtemperature, can be varied in order to influence the separationefficiency and, thus, resolution.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Chiroscience BlendsChemistry, EnzymesChiroscience Ltd. (Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, CambridgeCB4 4WE, U.K.; Tel: 44/01/223-420430, Fax: 44/01/223-420440) makesthe claim of being the world's leading chiral technology company.At the very least, it is one of the larger companies specializingin this field. The company was founded by Chris Evans and is headedby Nowell Stebbing.  Andrew Headland is the marketing manager, andJoe Carey runs international collaborations.The company has a willingness to employ both chemical reagents andenzymes to make chiral compounds.  Moreover, it is wedded toneither resolution nor asymmetric synthesis, accepting bothapproaches to the furnishing of enantiomers. The company, however,does regard itself as a pharmaceutical firm, excluding otherapplications of chiral technology from its portfolio of interests.Recently, Chiroscience acquired a license to phospholane asymmetrichydrogenation catalysts from Du Pont.  Hydrogenation is one of themost common reactions in preparative chemistry. The company notesthat rhodium complexes of Du Pont's DuPhos ligand family haveapplicability to obtaining single-enantiomer amino acids by anasymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral enamides.The reductions have high turnovers of catalyst, a low requirementof hydrogen pressure, stereoconvergent  transformation of Z/Emixtures, and high enantiomeric excesses. The phospholane catalystswere discovered by Mark Burk at Du Pont, and he continues to workat Duke University (North Carolina).  His latest advance is thehydrogenation of b,b-disubstituted enamides in a medium ofsupercritical carbon dioxide, giving the highest enantiomericexcesses so far attained for the reduction of such tetrasubstitutedolefins.Chiroscience also licenses ligands from Professor Barry Trost atStanford University (Palo Alto, CA), which the company uses forpalladium catalysts to promote asymmetric allylic substitutionreactions, for instance, the generation of carbovir (an antiviral)and aristeromycin. The Trost catalysts can also be used to convertallylic carbonates and acetates into useful synthons by reactionwith nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles, providingaccess to a wide range of chiral cyclic molecules. Eitherenantiomer can be produced.Unnatural amino acids are of increasing importance as components oftherapeutic peptides, by modifying the receptor selectivity of thepeptide, and by enhancing its metabolic resistance to degradationor by improving its bioavailability.  Chiroscience has developed a"one-pot" route to unnatural amino acids using an immobilizedacylase for the resolution of the BOC derivative.  The unwantedisomer recovered after the resolution is racemized and put backinto the process stream. The company now seeks to apply this methodto the production of cyclic amino acids as analogs of proline orpipecolic acid.When a D-acetyl amino acid is racemized with acetic anhydride, anazlactone is formed as an intermediate.  This intermediatespontaneously racemizes via its achiral enol tautomer, butazlactones also can be biotransformed.  For instance,  theintroduction of n-butanol into  tert-leucine azolactone  using alipase takes place only on the L isomer, but the D isomerspontaneous racemizes, channeling all the material toward the L ina process known as "dynamic resolution.  Additionally, whenazlactones are made by condensation of an N-acyl glycine (such ashippuric acid) with an aldehyde, the resulting olefins can beopened to enamides, which then serve as substrates for the DuPhoshydrogenation.The g-lactam synthon (-)-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one is anintermediate for the synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides havingthe same configuration as the natural ones they mimic.Chiroscience's chemistry has the capability of producing not onlythe lactam but also more advanced downstream intermediates.  Thecompany uses a proprietary resolution methodology based onenantiocomplementary biotransformations by lactamases selected byscreening microorganisms of the natural environment.  Applying thisprocess ultimately results in at least a 20,000- fold improvementin biocatalyst cost relative to early biocatalysts.Among the pharmaceutical compounds for which Chiroscience hasdeveloped production methods are a protein kinase C inhibitor, animmunosuppressant, a k-opioid analgesic, and a dopaminergicagonist.Therapeutic Compounds from ChiroscienceSource: Chiroscience Ltd.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTEREOCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CALENDARFebruary 5-7, 1996, PrepTech '96, East Rutherford, NJ.

Bibeau v. Pacific NorthwestResearch Foundation Inc. et al., No. 95-06410-HO (D OR).     The inmates consented to the experiments, which involved x-ray irradiation of their sex organs, but the defendants conspiredto conceal from them the true nature of the research and therisks involved, the complaint charges.     Harold Bibeau, an inmate at Oregon State Penitentiary inSalem, OR, from 1963 to 1969, and his wife Melanie Ann, filed thecomplaint on behalf of three classes of alleged victims: the 67inmates who were subjected to the experiments, their familymembers and any children who were conceived after the subjectswere irradiated.     Named as defendants are two laboratories, the PacificNorthwest Research Foundation Inc. (PNRF) and Battelle PacificNorthwest Laboratories; two medical doctors who were employed bythe Oregon Department of Corrections, Dr. Daniel E. Dilaconi andDr. Fernando Leon; a PNRF employee, Mavis Rowley, and fourofficials of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the forerunnerto the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), whichallegedly funded and oversaw the experiments.     According to the complaint, the prison experiments (calledthe Heller experiments after chief researcher Dr. Carl Heller,now deceased) were undertaken after a 1962 accident at theHanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, WA, exposed workers tosignificant amounts of ionizing radiation.     The AEC wanted to study the short- and long-term effects ofionizing radiation on spermatogenesis among the workers and alsoto investigate the effects of long-term exposure on pilots of athen-proposed nuclear-powered airplane (which was neverdeveloped), the complaint charges.     The Heller experiments involved irradiating the inmates'testes with eight to 600 rads of radiation over 10 years from1963 to 1973.  Periodically, the researchers gathered blood,urine and semen from the inmates and also performed biopsies andvasectomies on them.     The defendants knew that the experiments subjected theinmates to prolonged pain, increased their risks of developingcancer and other serious illnesses, and caused radiation sicknessand burns and chromosomal damage that may affect the health ofchildren conceived after the testing.  They conspired to concealthose risks from the test subjects, the complaint charges.     Bibeau claims he and the other inmates were thus deprived ofthe opportunity to give their informed consent and that theprison environment and the large monetary compensation theinmates were given relative to their regular prison compensationwere inherently coercive.     He alleges violations of civil and constitutional rights,intentional infliction of physical harm and emotional distress,strict liability, personal injury, absence of informed consent,loss of consortium, negligence, gross negligence, breach offiduciary duty, conspiracy, fraudulent concealment and failure toprovide ongoing medical monitoring.  The complaint also states aclaim pursuant to Bivens (Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents ofthe Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 [1971]) because italleges that government officials (the AEC defendants) andprivate parties illegally conspired to cause injuries to theplaintiffs.     Bibeau is seeking compensatory damages of $50 million andpunitive damages of $200 million, medical monitoring of theinmates and any children conceived after the experiments,interest and attorneys' fees and costs.     The plaintiffs are represented by Daniel Berger, StanleySiegel, Bernadette M. Rappold and Eric L. Cramer of Berger andMontague, Philadelphia; E. Cooper Brown and H.W.

In re Mildred Wiley, No. A9-365951 (U.S. Dept. ofLabor, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs).     The decision is believed to be the first award of benefitsfor a workplace injury attributed to environmental tobacco smoke(ETS).     The claim was brought by Philip E. Wiley of Marion, IN, whoclaimed that his wife, Mildred, died as the result of exposure toETS during the course of her employment at the VA Medical Centerin Marion, where she worked for 18 years.  Mildred Wiley died atthe age of 56, one month after being diagnosed with lung cancerin 1991.     Wiley contended that his wife's only exposure to cigarettesmoke was during her work at the hospital.     Wiley's claim was denied twice, once in 1992 and again in1993, on grounds that the causal relationship between MildredWiley's cancer and her ETS workplace exposure had not beenestablished.     The claim was resubmitted in December 1994 by Wiley'sattorneys, Joseph Young and William N. Riley of Young & Riley inIndianapolis, and was accompanied by a report from Dr. David M.Burns, a University of San Diego medical professor who hastestified in several tobacco cases.     According to the compensation order issued by Cynthia F.Bujakowski, Labor Department reconsideration claims examiner,Burns said that based on a review of the entire record, "MildredWiley's adenocarcinoma of the lung, and the carcinogenic processitself, was significantly aggravated and accelerated by herexposure to ETS at her worksite."     Burns also noted that neither Mildred Wiley, her husband,family or friends smoked cigarettes and that she avoided ETS inpublic and social situations.  Also, Burns said, Mildred Wileyregularly worked in an environment where ETS was commonly presentat levels where the tobacco smoke was easily visible orperceptible.     Burns said that "tobacco smoke is the only proven human lungcarcinogen that [Mildred Wiley] was exposed to at a substantiallevel."     The VA contested the claim, arguing that Mildred Wiley hadnever complained about cigarette smoke and that she had lived inseveral other cities where she could have been exposed to othercarcinogens before beginning work at the hospital in 1973.     Bujakowski noted in the compensation opinion that, inresponse to the earlier claims, the hospital did not dispute theextent of Wiley's exposure to cigarette smoke.  And, Bujakowskisaid, the hospital's own expert witness conceded that he couldnot rule out ETS as the cause of Mildred Wiley's cancer.     Riley, Wiley's attorney, said that Wiley will receive a$1,000 death and funeral benefit and will be entitled to paymentsof approximately $21,500, one-half his wife's annual salary, eachyear for the rest of his life.     In May 1993, Wiley filed a product liability suit againstthe major cigarette manufacturers in Delaware County, IN, statecourt (Dunn et al. v. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. et al.,No. 18D019305CT06 [IN, Delaware Cty.]).  The tobacco industrymoved to transfer the case to Grant County; that motion wasdenied.  The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed, holding that thecase should be transferred from Delaware County to Grant Countybecause Mildred Wiley resided in Grant County at the time of herdeath.  The plaintiffs appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court.     On Dec. 5, the Indiana Supreme Court reversed the Court ofAppeals and affirmed the trial court decision that the propervenue for the trial was the Delaware County, IN, court.     The VA, which is responsible for making the payments toWiley, could seek recovery by filing a claim against any judgmentWiley may win in his lawsuit, or by filing claims against thecompanies directly.Back to Headline List CopyrightTOXIC CHEMICALS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996NC CT.: OFFICIAL NOTICEOF CONTAMINATION STARTSCLAIM CLOCK RUNNING     An official government notice of well water contaminationstarts the statute of limitations running, even if a plaintiffnotices earlier that the water smells and tastes bad, the NorthCarolina Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5.  Crawford v. Boyette etal., No. COA95-37 (NC Ct. App.).     The panel reinstated a nuisance, trespass and strictliability suit against the owner and operator of a gas station bya residential neighbor.     From 1986 to 1991, John Crawford rented a house near a gasstation owned by Gary Boyette and operated by Cary Oil Co.  WhenCrawford moved in, he attributed the noticeable funny smell andtaste of his well water to the known presence of lime in thevicinity.     In 1987, he contacted the county health department, whichrecommended chlorination but did not test for petroleum products.It was not until April 6, 1989, that Crawford was notified by thestate of specific chemical compounds found in his water,including benzene and paradichlorobenzene.  In June 1989, hereceived the state's official health risk evaluation warning ofthe risks of gasoline contamination.     A nuisance and trespass complaint was filed in Wake CountySuperior Court on April 2, 1992, within three years of theApril 6, 1989, notice.  Judge George R. Greene granted summaryjudgment in favor of the defense, holding the suit barred by thethree-year limitations period.     The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded in an opinion byJudge Ralph A. Walker, saying the limitations period did notstart to run until Crawford received official notification thatchemicals from petroleum products were found in his water.Although Crawford noticed a peculiar smell and taste, heattributed those problems to lime and took reasonable steps todetermine whether his well was contaminated by contacting thecounty health department, it said.     In addition, it said Crawford received no warnings aboutpetroleum contamination until the state sent its detailedevaluation in June 1989.     Kenneth N. Barnes argued for Crawford.

Hunter et al. v. Estate of Baecher etal., No. 2:95CV878 (ED VA).     A complaint was filed in state court against the estate ofJohn Joseph Baecher, who owned the property leased to theplaintiffs.  It was amended to add as a defendant the NorfolkRedevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA), which administers thefederal section8 subsidized housing program.  As amended, thecomplaint seeks $5 million in damages under section1983 andfederal housing statutes, breach of contract, negligence, breachof warranty and violations of the state Residential Landlord andTenant Act and Virginia Consumer Protection Act.     After it was added to the suit, the NRHA petitioned toremove the case to the Eastern District of Virginia on the basisof the federal court's original jurisdiction over the civilrights and federal housing statute claims.  The plaintiffs movedto remand to state court, and arguments were heard on the motionon Nov. 17.     U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. denied the remandmotion, rejecting arguments that state claims predominate andthat construction of the two Virginia statutes in the context oflead paint poisoning present novel and complex issues that statecourts should resolve.     Although case law in Virginia is sparse on how thelandlord-tenant statute handles lead paint poisoning disputes,that statute is modeled on a uniform statute with abundant caselaw, the judge said.  In addition, he said the state law claimsare no more technically or intellectually involved than thefederal claims.     Beyond that, Judge Clarke found the interests of judicialeconomy and fairness to the litigants warrant supplementaljurisdiction over the state law claims.  The federal and stateclaims all center around the issue of what duties exist regardingthe presence of lead paint in a rental residence; the parties andoperative facts also are the same.  Nor does the statute underwhich the case was removed to federal court authorize a remand ofthe federal questions, he said.     "In this case, Plaintiffs have consolidated their claimsagainst the two defendants and have invoked federal law in theprocess.  In bringing one suit, Plaintiffs and Defendants couldexpect to be part of only one proceeding.  By bringing federalclaims, Plaintiffs could expect that proceeding would take placein federal court.  Defendants, by removing the case, showed theirpreference for federal court," Judge Clarke said.     The plaintiffs were represented by Richard James Serpe,Harold Seward Lawlor and Richard Steven Glasser of Glasser &Glasser in Norfolk; and by Oscar Lawrence Gilbert of Rabinowitz,Rafal, Swartz, Taliaferro & Gilbert in Norfolk.

People ex rel. Lungren v. American Standard et al.,No. 948017 (CA Super. Ct., San Francisco Cty.).     Judge Bea also granted the state's request for sanctions inthe amount of $950.  He ruled that Pfister's motion was notentirely frivolous, but that it showed bad faith by introducing aconfidential settlement letter from the state that it had agreedto keep out of the proceedings.     Pfister was one of 16 defendants in a suit brought by thestate and several environmental groups alleging that the faucetmakers were in violation of the Safe Drinking Water and ToxicEnforcement Act, also known as Proposition 65, a state lawenacted in 1986 that prohibits the discharge of toxic chemicalsinto sources of drinking water.     The settlement agreement with seven of the major faucetmanufacturers was approved in October in Superior Court over theobjections of Pfister and Chicago Faucet Co.  It calls for thefaucet makers to eliminate lead from their faucets by 1999 and toaffix warning labels on faucets that do not meet California'sstandard limiting the amount of lead in drinking water to0.5 micrograms of lead per day.  The seven companies " AmericanStandard, Moen, Masco, Eljer, Elkay, Whirlpool and UniversalRundle " have agreed to apply the same standards nationwide.     The settlement came about after the state lost its caseagainst the faucet manufacturers in Superior Court and lost anappeal in the California Court of Appeal.  The defendantssuccessfully argued that household drinking water is not a"source of drinking water" within the meaning of Proposition 65.However, in two consolidated cases in Alameda County againstthree water pump manufacturers, the Superior Court ruled just theopposite, i.e., that Proposition 65 does apply to tap water, thusprompting the settlement.  The three water pump manufacturersalso joined in the settlement.     In the meantime, the California Supreme Court has agreed tohear an appeal of the appellate court ruling in the San Franciscocase solely on the issue of whether Proposition 65 includesplumbing fixtures.     In its motion to vacate, Pfister argued that the court erredin presuming that the attorney general properly carried out hisduty to enforce Proposition 65 and that the court accepted animproper standard for testing the lead content in faucets thatdoes not accurately detect whether the daily lead exposureexceeds the legal limit of .5 micrograms per day.     Judge Bea ruled that Pfister misconstrued the attorneygeneral's actions and the consent judgment.     "No 'standard' has been adopted by the Attorney General orthe Court.  The testing protocol at issue is merely a means forimplementing and enforcing the .5 micrograms of lead per dayexposure standard called for in the regulations," he said.     The state had requested $2,500 in sanctions against Pfisterfor bringing a frivolous motion to vacate, but Judge Bea foundthat the motion was not wholly frivolous because the state'sRules of Civil Procedure do permit parties to contend that acourt's decision is based on legal error.  He did find, however,that Pfister showed bad faith in filing the confidentialsettlement letter under seal as part of its motion and in usingthe letter as the basis of a declaration from an expert witnessthat the testing protocol is not accurate.     Pfister had agreed not to use the letter in any form in thelitigation and it should have adhered to that agreement, he said."'An honest man's word is his bond,'" Judge Bea said quoting fromDon Quixote.  "In this court, at least, the words of Don Miguelde Cervantes are not only found true but enforced."  He ruledthat the state is entitled to recoup $950, its expenditurescaused by Pfister's use of the letter.     Pfister was represented by James L. Meeder, San Francisco.The state was represented by Deputy Attorney General Edward G.Weil.Back to Headline List CopyrightTOXIC CHEMICALS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 2, 19969TH CIRCUIT REINSTATESCOUNTY WORKER'S CLAIMSAGAINST EXTERMINATORS     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Oct. 26reinstated the claims of a former Santa Clara County, CA, planneragainst two exterminating companies that she alleges made hersick when they applied pesticides to the building where sheworked.  Jensen v. County of Santa Clara et al., Nos. 94-16063and 94-16824 (9th Cir.).     The appellate court, however, ruled that her claims againstthe county and some of its employees are barred by California'sworkers compensation and government immunity statutes.     Cheriel Jensen was an associate planner for Santa ClaraCounty from 1977 to 1993.  On June 14, 1993, she filed suit inSanta Clara Superior Court against the county, 14 countyemployees and officials, two pest control companies " Instar PestConsultants Inc. and Applied Pest Management Inc. (APM) " and anAPM official, Gregory Clark.  Instar provided pest controlservices to the county from 1983 to 1990, and APM provided pestcontrol services from 1990 to 1993.     Jensen's suit alleged that the two companies applied apesticide called Safrotin, which made her chronically ill.Acting pro se, she alleged 22 federal and state law causes ofaction including negligence, failure to warn, denial of civilrights, violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act,fraudulent concealment and breach of contract.     The suit was removed to U.S. District Court for the NorthernDistrict of California where Judge James Ware dismissed 13 of thecounty defendants and 17 of Jensen's causes of action.  He alsodismissed with leave to amend five of Jensen's claims against theremaining county defendants, and Jensen filed a first amendedcomplaint in February 1994.     In April 1994, Judge Ware granted summary judgment toInstar, finding that Jensen's personal injury claims against thecompany were time-barred by California's one-year statute oflimitations.  He later denied Jensen's motion to remand the suitto state court, dismissed her remaining claims against the countydefendant and dismissing her second amended complaint against APMand Clark.     Jensen appealed all of those judgments, and the NinthCircuit affirmed all but the personal injury claims againstInstar and her second amended complaint against APM.     According to the unpublished opinion, the circuit courtfound that the district court correctly dismissed the claimsagainst the county defendants because they are barred by theexclusivity provisions of the California Workers' CompensationAct.     The lower court also correctly dismissed the claims againstthe county employees and officials because they are immune fromliability for actions taken within the scope of their employmentunder the California Government Code section820.9, the appellatepanel said.     In addition, Judge Ware ruled correctly that Jensen couldnot file a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)because it is not retroactive.  She stopped working 25 daysbefore the ADA went into effect, the circuit court said.     On the personal injury claims against Instar, the NinthCircuit reversed and remanded Judge Ware's dismissal of thoseclaims because they were filed on time from the date shediscovered the alleged cause of her injuries.  Although Jensenhad suffered symptoms from 1977, she believed that her illnesswas caused by the state's Malathion medfly spraying.  It was notuntil June 12, 1992, that she discovered that her injuries mayhave been caused by the county's pest control actions, and shefiled her first complaint on June 14, 1993, which is within theone-year statute of limitations period, the appellate court said.     The Ninth Circuit also reinstated Jensen's second amendedcomplaint against APM, which the district court had dismissedbecause of her failure to comply with its court order to removefour claims.  The appellate panel said that Jensen did try tocomply with the order and that the district court's sanction wastoo harsh and constituted an abuse of its discretion.Back to Headline List CopyrightTOXIC CHEMICALS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 2, 19969TH CIR. DETERMINES HEALTHASSESSMENT TO CONSTITUTEREMOVAL OR RESPONSE     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 affirmed aWashington federal court's dismissal of a citizens' group's bidto compel the Agency for Toxic Research and Disease Registry(ATSDR) to initiate a health assessment program in the region ofthe Hanford Nuclear Reservation.  Hanford Downwinders Coalitionet al. v. Dowdle et al., No. 94-35100 (9th Cir.).     The panel agreed that no federal court jurisdiction existedover the claim and concluded that the ATSDR's ongoing healthassessment activity in the region constituted a removal orremedial action for the purposes of CERCLA's Timing of Reviewprovision.     The litigation stems from ongoing cleanup efforts at theHanford facility in Richland, WA, which for some 30 yearsproduced plutonium for the Department of Defense.  The facilitygenerated releases of radioactive iodine and other hazardoussubstances into the atmosphere, soil and water of the region.     In 1988, the EPA proposed adding the Hanford site to theNational Priorities List (NPL).  The following year, the EPA,Department of Energy and Washington Department of Ecologyoutlined their response.  The ATSDR was assigned specificresponsibilities under the response plan to prepare preliminaryhealth assessments, and was given the discretion to expand themto full health assessments if warranted.     The Hanford site has remained the subject of continuedresearch by the ATSDR.  In 1993, the ATSDR declared the site tobe among the Superfund sites posing the greatest threat to publichealth, and has applied the results of the Centers for DiseaseControl's 1994 study to its criteria for determining whethermedical monitoring would be appropriate.     Plaintiffs Hanford Downwinders Coalition Inc. (HDC) broughtthe instant litigation in July 1993, alleging that the ATSDR hasa mandatory duty under CERCLA section9604(i)(9) to commence ahealth surveillance program in the region, including medicaltesting and monitoring for individuals exposed to radioactiveiodine.  The Eastern District of Washington granted the defense'sdismissal motion, concluding that the ATSDR's health-relatedactivities at Hanford constituted ongoing removal or responseactivity, and that the plaintiffs' claim was therefore animpermissible challenge.     Affirming, the Ninth Circuit first rejected the plaintiffs'contentions that the language of the statute supported theirconstruction of the statute.  The HDC asserted that when Congressinstructed the ATSDR to "effectuate and implement [CERCLA's]health-related authorities" in section9604(i)(1) of the statute,it meant to distinguish these health-related authorities from"response authorities" as defined under section9604.  "There isno indication that Congress' characterization of ATSDRauthorities as 'health related' was intended to render thesection9604 'response authorities' section superfluous as toATSDR actions," the panel rejoined.     The panel found that the language of section9604(i)(1)"should be read narrowly as a means to distinguish betweendifferent types of response authorities, rather than interpretedbroadly as an effort to differentiate ATSDR health assessment andsurveillance activity from response actions protected by theTiming of Review provision."     Cautioning that not all section9604 "response authorities"are to be considered removal or remedial actions per se, theNinth Circuit engaged in an analysis of whether the ATSDR'sconduct could be shown to be removal or remedial activity.  "TheATSDR health assessment and surveillance activities challenged bythe HDC," the panel wrote, "are a necessary part of thegovernment's efforts to safeguard the public health at NPLsites....  [The ATDSR] is an integral part of Congress' effort toprotect the health of those exposed to hazardous releases fromfacilities listed on the NPL."     The court reconciled the instant case with its holdings inDurfey v. E.I. DuPont (1995) (See Toxic Chemicals LR, July 18,1995, P. 21,563) and Price v. U.S. Navy (1994) which declaredthat independent private actions for medical monitoring were notremoval or remedial actions.  "The reasoning in Durfey and Pricedoes not apply to health assessment and surveillance actionsengaged in by a governmental agency pursuant to explicit CERCLAprovisions," wrote the panel.     The plaintiffs pointed to the structure of CERCLA, notingthat section9607(a)(4)(A), which provides for the government torecover "all costs of removal or remedial action," is separatefrom section9607(a)(4)(D), which provides for the recovery of"the costs of any health assessment" made by the ATSDR.  Thepanel rejoined that section9607(a)(4)(D) was in fact part of the1986 SARA amendments, and "decline[d] to read the failure ofCongress to accomplish the seamless integration of ATSDRprovisions with the other authorities found under subsection9607(a)(4)(A) as compelling proof of Congress' intent todistinguish ATSDR activities from removal and remedial actions."     The plaintiffs also pointed to the separate treatment ofresponse costs and ATSDR costs in CERCLA sections 9611(a) and9611(c).  Noting the fact that the legislative history was silentas to why the distinction was made, the panel stated itsobligation "to choose the interpretation that is most consistentwith the remainder of the Act."     Having established that the ATSDR's conduct constitutedremoval or remedial action, the Ninth Circuit disposed of HDC'sassertions that the requirements of the Timing of Reviewprovision were otherwise unsatisfied.  The panel looked to its1995 holdings in MESS v. Perry (see Hazardous Waste LR, March 1,1995, P. 28,144) and Razore v. Tulalip Tribes (see HazardousWaste LR, Oct. 4, 1995, P. 28,238) in concluding that the HDC'ssuit was a "challenge" to the ongoing removal or remediation.     Tom H. Foulds, Seattle, represents the appellants.     Elizabeth Ann Peterson of the U.S. Department of Justice,Environment and Natural Resources Division, Washington, DC,represents the appellees.Back to Headline List CopyrightTOXIC CHEMICALS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 2, 19963RD CIR.: NEIGHBORS,VISITORS TO WASTE SITEARE NOT KNOWN CREDITORS     Neighbors of a dump site contaminated by low-level radiationwere not known creditors and, therefore, the corporate owner ofthe sites had no obligation to provide them with actual noticewhen it went into bankruptcy, the Third Circuit U.S. Court ofAppeals ruled Dec. 18.  Chemetron Corp. v. Jones et al., No. 94-3371 (3rd Cir.).     From 1965 to 1975, Chemetron Corp. owned and operated amanufacturing facility that made an antimony oxide catalystutilizing depleted plutonium, as well as a nearby landfill whereit dumped waste products from that manufacturing process inCuyahoga Heights, OH.  Chemetron sold the sites in 1975, but wasinvolved in cleanup efforts between 1980 and 1988 after it wasdiscovered that the sites were contaminated with radioactivewaste.     In 1988, Chemetron filed for Chapter 11 reorganization inU.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.The court issued a claims bar date order fixing the last day forcreditors to file claims as May 31, 1988.  Chemetron sent therequired actual notice to all of its known creditors and alsovoluntarily placed advertisements in the New York Times and WallStreet Journal in an effort to reach any unknown creditors.     In 1992, 15 individuals filed suit against Chemetron and itssuccessors in interest in the Cuyahoga County Court of CommonPleas claiming to have been injured from exposure to radioactiveand toxic chemicals at the dump site.  Eventually the list ofplaintiffs grew to 21.  Two of the plaintiffs had lived in housesnear the site and the rest were periodic visitors to the houses.     Chemetron moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that any suchclaim had been discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings thatended in 1990.  The plaintiffs then petitioned the bankruptcycourt to be allowed to file late claims.  In August 1993, thebankruptcy court granted the petition, finding that theplaintiffs were known creditors that had been entitled to actualnotice of the proceedings and the claims bar date.  Thebankruptcy court then reserved ruling on the issue of whether theplaintiffs' claims were dischargeable.     Chemetron appealed the bankruptcy court ruling to the U.S.District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, whichreversed the bankruptcy court's grant of the motion to file lateclaims.  The district court held that the plaintiffs were notknown creditors and that the notice published in the two nationalnewspapers was sufficient to alert them to the bankruptcyproceedings.  The district court also ruled, without explanation,that the plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable and weredischarged as a result of the bankruptcy action.     The plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit, which affirmedthe district court finding that the plaintiffs are unknowncreditors.  In Tulsa Professional Collection Service Inc. v.Roper, 485 U.S. 478, 490 (1988), the U.S. Supreme Courtcharacterized a known creditor as one whose identity is eitherknown or "reasonably ascertainable by the debtor," Circuit JudgeJane R. Roth wrote.  Generally, debtors are expected to identifyknown creditors through a careful search of their own books andrecords and further efforts are not required, she explained.     In this case, she said, the bankruptcy court replaced the"reasonably ascertainable" standard with a "reasonablyforeseeable" standard.  Under that test, the bankruptcy courtsaid Chemetron knew or should have known that it was reasonablyforeseeable that it would suffer claims from individuals livingnear the sites, making them known creditors.     This "reasonably foreseeable" standard is an incorrect ruleof law that imposes an impossible burden on debtors, the ThirdCircuit found.  None of the claimants currently lives near thesite and some have moved as far away as Texas.  "We are hardpressed to conceive of any way the debtor could identify, locate,and provide actual notice to these claimants," Judge Roth said.     Having affirmed the district court's ruling that theplaintiffs were unknown claimants in the bankruptcy action andthat the newspaper notices therefore were sufficient to informthem of the proceedings, the circuit court found that thedistrict court erred in failing to consider whether theplaintiffs' failure to file their claims in a timely manner wasdue to "excusable neglect."  The appellate panel remanded thatissue to the district court with instructions to consider thetotality of the circumstances and the potential prejudicialimpact on Chemetron.               It also vacated the district court's ruling that theplaintiffs' claims were dischargeable and discharged by thebankruptcy action and remanded that issue to the bankruptcycourt.  Because the bankruptcy court had postponed ruling on theissue of discharge, it was not an appealable order and thereforewas not properly before the district court, the Third Circuitsaid.     Circuit Judge H. Lee Sarokin concurred in the judgment butsaid that the Third Circuit went too far in discarding the"reasonably ascertainable" test entirely.  "These tests are notmutually exclusive, or even at odds.  They address separateissues," Judge Sarokin wrote.  One has to do with whether adebtor knew or should have known a claim would be brought whilethe other has to do with the debtor's ability to identify apotential claimant, he said.

James v. Southern CaliforniaEdison Co., No. 94-1085 (SD CA).     Howarth filed a notice of appeal on Dec. 22.  He said thathis client, Glen James, 63, who is suffering from chronicmyelogenous leukemia, is in rapidly deteriorating health and thathe wants to expedite the appeal on James' behalf "while it maystill do him some good."  James, an engineer, worked at SONGS inthe mid-1980s.     Howarth moved for a new trial after the eight-person juryreturned a verdict in favor of defendants Southern CaliforniaEdison and Combustion Engineering Inc. on Oct. 12.  He arguedthat the jury was improperly influenced by the O.J. Simpson trialand by juror misconduct.     Howarth argued that the verdict was against the weight ofthe evidence, that it was the product of improper passion andprejudice and that the jury improperly considered extraneous,prejudicial information.               According to the motion, one of the jurors, GenevieveFitzwater, told the others that she had received radiationtherapy for thyroid cancer and that "it had saved my life."  Inaddition, after the jurors were allowed to watch the verdict inthe O.J. Simpson case, Fitzwater also allegedly told the othersthat they must apply the same "reasonable doubt" standard used inthe Simpson murder case to the evidence in this case.     James also alleged that a second juror told a post-verdictgathering that he had made his mind up for the defense early inthe trial before all of the evidence had been presented and thathe had never wavered in his belief.     Southern District of California Judge Napoleon Jones Jr.rejected all of those arguments, finding that under the FederalRules of Evidence, most of juror Gregory Hafen's declarationsupporting the allegations of juror misconduct is inadmissible.     According to Rule 606(b), a juror may not testify toanything that may have influenced his decision duringdeliberations except on the question of whether extraneousprejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury'sattention.     Under that rule, only Fitzwater's statements about herradiation treatment and applying the reasonable doubt standardmay be admissible if they can be shown to be extraneousinformation and prejudicial by a preponderance of the evidence,Judge Jones said.     He ruled, however, that Fitzwater's alleged statements abouther radiation treatment are not prejudicial extraneousinformation but "are best classified as personal experienceapplied to the evidence in the case...."     Citing to Hard v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., 870 F.2d1461 (9th Cir. 1989), Judge Jones said, "The type of after-acquired information that potentially taints a jury verdictshould be carefully distinguished from the general knowledge,opinions, feelings and bias that every juror carries into thejury room."     In Hard, he said, the Ninth Circuit found that it isacceptable for a juror to use his own personal experience tointerpret the evidence in a case.  In addition, even ifFitzwater's statements did constitute impermissible extraneousinformation, the plaintiff failed to show prejudice by apreponderance of the evidence.     On the reasonable doubt issue, Judge Jones found that suchallegations are not admissible because they constitute testimonyon the mental processes of the jury.  He found no Ninth Circuitprecedence on the issue, but he cited two Fifth Circuit U.S.Court of Appeals cases that hold that once a verdict is rendered,the court may not inquire into the jury's deliberative process todetermine if the jury properly followed the court's instructions(United States v. D'Angelo, 598 F.2d 1002 [1979] and Robles v.Exxon Corp., 862 F.2d 1201 [1989]).     In addition to Howarth, the Jameses are represented bySuzelle M. Smith of Howarth & Smith in Los Angeles.

Beck v.A & D Limited Partnership et al., No. A-91-06574 (OH C.P. Ct.,Hamilton Cty.).     While Common Pleas Judge John W. O'Keefe found that theevidence overwhelmingly supported a finding of negligence, hedenied the plaintiffs' motion for j.n.o.v. with regard topunitive damages and also denied their motion for a new trial.His decision was entered into judgment on Dec. 6.     (The memorandum specifying grounds for the decision isavailable from Andrews Document Access Service.)     Judge O'Keefe granted j.n.o.v. to plaintiffs Sue Marshall,Linda Bachman, Karen M. Ringland and Joseph Schwetschenau.  Hedenied a motion for j.n.o.v. as to the loss of consortium claimsof Schwetschenau's wife, Dolores, finding that the jury's verdicton that claim was acceptable.     The four plaintiffs were sample plaintiffs for some 700class members who claim that the A & D Building where they workin Cincinnati caused headaches, fatigue, drowsiness, sore throat,sinus problems, nausea, dizziness, eye irritation, chest pains,disorientation, anguish and justifiable apprehension.     Judge O'Keefe said that the jury should have answered in theaffirmative both Interrogatory 1 (Were the defendants negligent?)and Interrogatory 2 (Do you find by a preponderance of theevidence that any defendant breached any lease agreement?).     "The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that A & D wasunsafe and unsanitary, and the defendants thus were negligent,and reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion as tosafety and sanitation," he said.               He cited the testimony of four expert witnesses thatconditions in the building caused human health problems, as wellas two exhibits from the Cincinnati Health Department thatverified the poor indoor air quality as evidence of causation.     Given his grant of j.n.o.v. on negligence, Judge O'Keefedenied the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial because, he said,there is no ground for a new trial unless the j.n.o.v. isoverturned on appeal.  By denying j.n.o.v. on the issue ofpunitive damages, Judge O'Keefe said that the jury verdictdenying punitive damages would stand for the entire class ofclaimants.     On the issue of actual damages, Judge O'Keefe ordered abench hearing for Jan. 8 to determine the amount of actualdamages.  That hearing has since been postponed pending aresolution of the appealability of the judge's j.n.o.v. order.In a footnote, Judge O'Keefe said that "probably there is nofinal appealable order until damages are determined and made partof the Court's ultimate judgment,"  but the notice of appealspecifically challenges the j.n.o.v.

Farr v. Motorola Inc.,No. 95-2530 PHX-ROS (D AZ).     The complaint alleges that Motorola has been dumpingtrichloroethylene (TCE) and 19 other toxic and hazardouschemicals into the air and ground since the 1950s and that aplume of the chemicals seeped into the groundwater that Farr andhundreds of other people used for drinking water.  It says thatFarr grew up in the vicinity of the plants.  Two of the plantshave been designated as federal Superfund sites, and the thirdhas been declared a polluted site under Arizona's state anti-pollution statute.     Farr was an All-American at Arizona State University beforeturning pro and becoming the youngest golfer to qualify for theLPGA tour in 1986.  She died in November 1993 after undergoing amastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a bone-marrowtransplant.     The complaint filed by her parents, Sharon and Gerald D.Farr, allege wrongful death, negligence, trespass, infliction ofemotional distress, fraudulent concealment/failure to warn andstrict liability.     According to the complaint, Motorola negligently disposed oflarge quantities of toxic chemicals in and around the plantsresulting in bodily harm to Farr.  The company had specialknowledge of the types, amounts, dates and methods of disposal ofthe chemicals going back the 1950s, but it failed to warn personsliving near the plants of the potential harm from the dumping andit made express and implied false representations to conceal thedangers of the chemicals from the public.     "Motorola's acts of knowingly and intentionally disposing oftoxic and hazardous substances and wastes into the environmentwithout proper treatment constitute extreme and outrageousconduct, which Motorola knew or should have known would causesevere emotional distress to persons such as the deceased oracted in reckless disregard of whether such emotional distresswould result," the complaint said.

FEMA handled the initialcleanup and relocation of Love Canal residents.     From 1942 to 1953, Oxychem's corporate predecessor, HookerChemical, dumped an estimated 22,000 tons of toxic chemicals andhazardous wastes at Love Canal from its Niagara Fallsmanufacturing plant.  The site was eventually covered over anddeeded to the City of Niagara Falls.  Homes and a school werelater built on and near it.  Chemicals began seeping into thehouses in the 1970s, sickening residents.  One resident, LoisGibbs, led a crusade to expose Hooker's actions and to clean upthe site.     In 1979, the federal government and New York state broughtsuit against Hooker.  The federal government initially soughtcompensation of more than $200 million in cleanup costs underCERCLA, and the state sought $250 million in punitive damages.Oxychem was held liable in the liability phase of the trial, butthe state's claims for punitive damages were denied.     In June 1994, Oxychem agreed to pay the state $98 million tosettle the remaining state claims.  The U.S. Army has also agreedto pay the government $8 million for its share of the costs forcleaning up hazardous waste that it dumped at the site duringWorld War II.     The consent decree, which is expected to receive finalapproval in 30 days, eliminates the need for a second trial ondamages.  Under its terms, Oxychem will pay the $129 million infour installments over three years, beginning three months afterthe court grants final approval.     While the proposed settlement closes out the federal andstate cleanup claims, it does not end the litigation over LoveCanal.  The City of Niagara Falls is seeking $4 million in costsand interest, and 900 former residents have personal injurylawsuits still pending.  In the wake of the federal and statesettlements, Niagara Falls expects that it will soon reach asettlement with the company to end its suit as well.     In announcing the settlement, U.S. Attorney General JanetReno called it "the transformation of an environmental disastercalled Love Canal into a success story.  It stands for theprinciple that when people make a mess, they should clean it up."     A spokesman for Occidental Chemical said that the companyhas never denied liability, but that the settlement represents acompromise among the parties on the amount of compensation,rather than fines or penalties.  The agreement, he said, avoidshaving to go through a protracted trial on damages.     Occidental Chemical is represented by Steven K. Yablonski ofPiper & Marbury, Washington, DC.

REVERSESCARRIER WIN ONWRONGFUL ENTRY     The California Court of Appeal, Second District, on Dec. 5overturned a Los Angeles judge's grant of summary adjudication toInsurance Co. of North America (INA) on the environmentalcoverage demands of Martin Marietta Corp.  Martin Marietta Corp.et al v. Insurance Co. of North America, No. B084709 (CACt. App., 2nd Dist.).     The panel found that the policyholder had raised the issueof potential of coverage for its environmental claims under the"wrongful entry" provisions of INA's policies.     Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) named its carriers tothe present action to determine their obligations concerning theinsured's liabilities incurred at multiple Superfund sites.  Thepolicyholder made claims against INA with respect to theStringfellow site and six others across the country.     INA issued automobile and personal injury coverage to MartinMarietta from 1968 to 1972; the insured averred that the"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right ofprivate occupancy" language provision of the personal injuryprovision created the potential of coverage for its environmentalliabilities.  The Los Angeles County Superior Court concludedthat the coverage "for certain damages because of personal injurycannot reasonably be construed as including government pollutionclean-up claims."     In its review, the state appellate panel noted INA'scontention that the "wrongful entry" language "provides coverageonly for 'classic landlord/tenant-type disputes.'  Under INA'sinterpretation, 'wrongful entry or eviction' refers only toforcible eviction claims brought by one with a possessoryinterest in the land, and 'other invasion of the right of privateoccupancy' extends that coverage to claims brought by occupants,rather than owners."     The court next looked to state precedent that interpretedthe challenged language outside of the environmental context.The panel found these cases to establish that "under Californialaw, the language 'wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasionof the right of private occupancy' is limited to tort claimsrelating to the invasion of an interest in real property....[C]ontrary to INA's argument here, personal injury coverage isnot determined by the nature of the damages sought in the actionagainst the insured, but by the nature of the claims made againstthe insured in that action."     The court then looked to the February 1994 ruling of theCalifornia Court of Appeal, Fourth District, in Titan Corp. v.Aetna Casualty, which had refused to find environmental coverageunder the personal injury provision.  "[U]nlike Martin Marietta'sINA policy, the insurance policy under review in Titan Corp.contained a pollution exclusion which 'unambiguously declared'that the policy would not pay for either bodily injury orproperty damage caused by pollution," wrote the panel.     The Titan court alternatively reasoned that it is not"objectively reasonable for an insured to expect personal injuryto mean property damage, or to expect contamination ofgroundwater to harm either a private right or an occupancyright."  The panel here found that this reasoning "seems todepart from California law."     After reviewing the federal and out-of-state precedent onthe issue cited by both sides, the panel found them to "lack aconsensus of approach and of result.  Many concern insurancepolicies which are in important ways different than the one weare called on to interpret."Back to Headline List CopyrightTOXIC CHEMICALS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996Trespass and Nuisance     In looking to the language of the policy at hand, the courtstated that it "cannot accept INA's contention that the coverageclause at issue is limited to 'classic landlord/tenant'claims....  [I]t seems manifest that 'wrongful entry,' in thecontext of torts relating to the invasion of an interest in realproperty, includes trespass and may include nuisance, and that areasonable insured would so understand the coverage."     INA averred that neither trespass nor nuisance wasspecifically enumerated in the torts listed under the policy; thepanel rejoined that "the language of the policy clearlyencompasses those causes of action, and there is no requirement,in the policy or in the law, that each covered cause of action be'specifically enumerated.'"     The panel cited to an 1885 ruling of the California SupremeCourt that stated that "every wrongful entry upon lands in theoccupation or possession of the owner constitutes a trespass."The court also noted that it is established in California "thattrespass and nuisance claims may include wrongful entry orinvasion by pollutants....  To agree with INA that 'wrongfulentry' does not include trespass and nuisance claims would fly inthe face of this long-standing law."               The panel rejected the insurer's contention that a wrongfulentry claim requires proof of forcible entry with intent toouster; it was further unmoved by the contention that theunderlying claimant (the government) cannot claim a right of"occupancy" in the contaminated groundwater.     "INA has not established that the government is seeking toenforce only a public or residual interest in groundwater," wrotethe court.  "Instead, the undisputed facts indicate that thegovernment claims include allegations that pollutants emanatingfrom Martin Marietta have contaminated the water wells andgroundwater on land owned by individuals, businesses, and,perhaps, governmental entities."     The court lastly determined that INA had not met its burdenof showing that it was entitled to summary judgment.  Theunderlying claims, wrote the panel, "are based in part ontrespass and nuisance....  [T]he actions [include] allegations ofwrongful entry and of invasions of the right of private occupancyin real property."     Kirk A. Pasich, Martin D. Katz and Linda D. Kornfeld ofTroop Meisinger Steuber & Pasich, Los Angeles, represent thepolicyholder.     W. Mark Wood, Martin S. Checov and H.

However, chemical hazards at DOE's weapons plants probably pose thegreatest threat to workers' health, notes "The Nuclear Weapons Complex:Management for Health, Safety and the Environment."  While substantialprogress has been made in controlling exposure to ionizing radiation, thereappears to be a less than adequate emphasis at DOE's plants on hazardsassociated with exposures to chemicals routinely used in industrialoperations, NRC says.  The substances of greatest concern includeberyllium, asbestos, cutting oils, organic solvents and plating solutions.     "Occupational medical programs within the complex should increase theemphasis placed on protection of workers from chemicals suspected to behazardous at the acute, subacute or chronic level of exposure," NRCrecommends.  The council suggests "removal of the worker from the hazard,as in the case of pregnant workers," as one type of "control" for handlingtoxic materials.  So-called "fetal protection policies" have come underfire in federal courts as discriminatory (TMN, Nov. 1, 1989).     The collection of health-related data concerning employees in thenuclear weapons complex is inadequate with regard to both the kinds of datacollected and how they are stored, NRC says.  To correct the situation, thereport urges DOE to improve monitoring and surveillance programs forexposure to hazardous substances through the use of standardized protocolsfor data collection and analysis.  "In particular, data collected withinthe complex should be comprehensive, accessible and comparable," the reportadvises.     NRC also cites as inadequate the fire control programs and the effortsto control inhalation of radioactive dust by workers.  At least twofacilities have plutonium in their exhaust ducts, it notes.     Blame for some of the problems lies with DOE's "complex managementstructure with ambiguous lines of responsibility and authority," the NRCsays.  The report suggests that safety and other related decisions shouldbe made "at the lowest possible management levels."  DOE has accumulated agreat deal of information on the effects of exposure to radiation and thisshould be made available for study, NRC adds.  DOE officials have promisedaction on this issue.

Researchers from the University ofNew Mexico and the Sandia National Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M., aredeveloping new chemical sensors using zeolite, a porous mineral that canact as a "molecular sieve."     Using polymers, the zeolite crystals can be arranged so that they actas highly selective chemical screens, said Thomas Bein, assistant chemistryprofes?sor at the University of New Mexico and a member of the researchteam.  These "screens" will allow only a single type of molecule to beabsorbed.  "The concept is very, very general and can be applied to almostall chemicals," he said.     Acoustic wave sensors located underneath a thin coating of thezeolites may enable detection of substances up to the parts-per-billionlevel.  This information then would be transmitted to a central controlstation without removing the sensor, Bein added.     This method of chemical monitoring has several advantages, Beinexplained.  Perhaps most importantly, it may allow for continuous and"almost instantaneous" monitoring that could provide early warnings ofpollution.  It also may eliminate the need for human involvement incollecting toxic samples.     The new technology has not yet been tested in the environment.  Butthe research team will be working on experimental testing devices aimed atmonitoring halogenated hydrocarbons leaking from waste dumps, Bein said.The research group hopes to test a number of different zeolites and developa data bank about the different sensors.  The project is sponsored by anEnergy Department program that encourages cooperation between New Mexicoacademic institutions and the two national laboratories in the state.  TheNational Science Foundation provided funding for the sensor project, whichstarted about 30 months ago, Bein added.     The research group's findings were presented Dec. 18 in a paper,"Molecular Sieve Sensors for Selective Operation at the Nanogram Level," atthe 1989 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies inHonolulu.

She cited this pact, under which member nations of the Paris-basedOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed todetermine the chemicals' adverse effects by 1994, as one of her threepriorities for administering the Toxic Substances Control Act.  (Fordetails on the OECD agreement, see TMN, Nov. 22, 1989).  The othersare pollution prevention, which is being pushed across-the-board byAdministrator William Reilly, and developing a strategic plan for theOffice of Toxic Substances.     "My [overall] priority is to take advantage of those three activitiesto target, perhaps, some new approaches to TSCA -- to build on what's goingon in the international community, to take a look at how we can use TSCA tobring about pollution prevention or better management of chemicals, and touse the strategic plans," she told TMN in a Dec. 15 interview.     EPA also is "looking at an initiative under [TSCA] Section 8(e) toidentify ... in industries' minds more clearly their responsibility underthat section to report to us adverse effect findings in their [chemical]studies," Fisher said, although she provided no timetable for a possibleproposal.Back to Headline List CopyrightTOXIC MATERIALS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 3, 1990EPA TO ASSESS PCB CONTAMINATIONIN HUDSON RIVER, AGENCY SAYS     Environmental Protection Agency officials in New York City havereleased plans to re-evaluate the pollution on the bottom of the HudsonRiver by polychlorinated biphenyl wastes from two General Electric Corp.plants.  The agency's Region 2 said there would be a "reassessment ofwhether further cleanup activities should now appropriately be taken underthe Superfund program."     The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has beenusing a demonstration program involving the dredging of the PCB sedimentsfrom the river and capping them in an aboveground landfill with a $20million federal grant under the Clean Water Act.     "EPA has decided to reassess the 1984 decision in light of additionaldata developed by New York state with respect to the movement andpersistence of the PCBs in the sediments, and in recognition of recentadvances in PCB-destruction technologies such as incineration," the agencysaid.  "EPA's reassessment will be carried out independently of the DEC[capping] plan."     But $17 million of the grant will be redirected to support New York'swastewater treatment programs due to delays in building a landfill for theriver sediment.  "The [state] project has not moved forward as plannedbecause of difficulties in siting the landfill," said EPA.     PCB wastes were released into the river in 1973 by two GE facilitiesin Fort Edward, N.Y.  In 1984, EPA signed a Superfund "record of decision"that postponed the removal of PCB-contaminated sediment from the riverbottom.

Although fields had not been treated since the previous growing year,55 percent of the streams tested in 10 farm states still had measurablelevels of herbicides such as atrazine and alachlor, both widely used oncorn and soybeans to control weeds.  A second round of sampling conductedin May and June -- after fresh applications of herbicides -- found 90percent of the streams had detect-able contamination and dozens of samplesexceeded federal health advisory standards for such residues.     Donald Goolsby, lead study author and USGS's water quality specialistfor the central United States, said his sampling team expected to find somecontamination, but not as mush as they did.  "The surprise was the largeand widespread concentrations," he explained.  "These herbicides have beendetected before in streams in agricultural states, but we do not know ofany reports of the wide-spread occurrences found in our study."     Agricultural chemicals should be at their lowest concentrations in theenvironment in the spring, Goolsby said, speculating that the springtimecontamination may be the result of streams tapping ground waterreservoirs, where herbicide residues can persist for six months or longer.Another explanation, he observed last week, might be related to the generaldrought conditions in the Midwest over the past few years.     "It's possible there has not been sufficient rainfall to flush them[herbicides] from the fields," he said.  The stream contamination "couldbe coming from the previous year's application."     The study tested streams in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.  Thosestates were chosen because they account for 60 percent of all pesticide usein the country and produce 75 percent of the nation's corn and 60 percentof its soybeans.     The second round of stream testing, conducted after springtime fieldspraying, found dozens of samples had concentrations of herbicide residuesabove federal health advisory levels.  Of the 127 samples, 71 exceeded theEnvironmental Protection Agency's health advisory level for atrazine and 44were higher than EPA's proposed drinking water standard for alachlor.  EPAhas classified alachlor as a probable human carcinogen and atrazine as apossible human carcinogen (Canada has banned alachlor).  The geologicalsurvey's study was not designed to test drinking water, Goolsby noted,although some of the sampling sites were up-stream of public water intakes.     In addition to its unprecedented scope, the study was innovativebecause it used a new enzyme-based immunoassay method for detectingherbicide residues in water, Goolsby said.  The new method is much fasterand cheaper than the traditional gas chromotography detection technique,and, if verified as accurate, could have a major impact on environmentalscience, he said.  The immunoassay method has been used primarily inmedical research.  The USGS study team currently is analyzing a thirdround of water samples collected in the late fall, when water flowgenerally is lowest and streams are being fed largely by ground water.Results from this round of testing are due this month.Back to Headline List CopyrightTOXIC MATERIALS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 3, 1990BOOK DETAILS ISSUES OFDISASTROUS AIR TOXICS RELEASES     Noyes Data Corp. of Park Ridge, New Jersey, has published a manualcalled Accidental Releases of Air Toxics that compiles "the technicalinformation that is necessary for developing approaches to preventing andcontrolling accidental releases."

RULEON POSTED PESTICIDE WARNINGS     A controversial New York regulation that would require farms, hotels,offices, residential buildings and restaurants to post notices before andafter pesticide use was rejected Dec. 21 by the Appellate Division of theNew York State Supreme Court.  Several groups representing the affectedindustries sued the state over the proposed rule.     The rule could not go into effect because the state Department ofEnvironmental Conservation had not not fully assessed the environmentalimpact of the regulation, as required by law, the court said.  The courtalso ruled that the DEC did not file the regulations on time.  Under thedecision, the department may have to repeat the public hearing process forthe regulation.     State officials have not yet decided whether to appeal the decision toNew York's highest court, said R.W. Groneman, a DEC spokesman.  DEC did notprepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the rule because stateofficials felt it would "have little or no adverse effect on theenvironment."     Agriculture groups, however, said the posting of signs might impedefarmers from using integrated pest management (IPM), which relies on thequick and judicious use of chemicals.  Since the final version of the ruleswould require only four hours' notice, instead of the 24-hour noticeoriginally proposed, DEC does not feel the law would impeded IPM, Gronemansaid.     But the court agreed with the farm groups.  "While it is true that DECmay have considered the IPM program in promulgating the regulations, theevidence in the record decisively demonstrates that the regulations wouldhave a major adverse impact on the IPM program, that DEC knew of thisevidence and that, therefore, an EIS was required to explore the entireissue thoroughly," Justice Norman Harvey wrote in his opinion for the court(his emphasis).     DEC continues to support the concept behind the regulations, whichwould require commercial establishments and farms to post notices informingthe public a few hours before pesticides are used and keep the noticesposted up to a full day after they are applied, Groneman said.  "The publichas a right to know about these dangerous chemicals that are, quitefrankly, used to kill things," he said, adding that this information canmean "life or death" to allergic individuals.  Hotel and restaurant groupshad argued the signs would discourage business, but the state maintains thepublic would quickly become acclimated to the notices, Groneman added.Back to Headline List CopyrightTOXIC MATERIALS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 3, 1990THE UNITED STATES indicted 101 corporations and individuals forTHE UNITED STATES indicted 101 corporations and individuals forenvironmental crimes in 1989, the Justice Department said last week.

Lotek Engineering has developed a digitally encoded radio system that has the design features unavailable from other manufacturers. The encoding system use a pulse coded design that allows up to 100 tags to be used simultaneously per frequency. Under this system, qualification of codes by pulse width is no longer necessary, thus enhancing the ability to accurately identify each individual fish. The power savings inherent in this design is used for: higher peak outputs (thereby increasing range) and producing a smaller size tag with longer operational life. Using the smallest tag available (with maximum range of tag life) is essential when implanting these tags in endangered fish. Another advantage of this encoding design is the use of different pulse codes under one frequency eliminates sequential scanning of different frequencies; therefore, increasing accuracy by eliminating delays in scan time. The pulse coded radio system has features critical to the application at Redlands Fish Ladder. Lotek Engineering Inc., is the only manufacturer of this type of equipment. ITEM NO. 1.

G/TBT/Notif. 95.354. 1. Member to Agreement notifying: CANADA. If applicable, name of local government involved (Articles 3.2 and 7.2): 2. Agency responsible: Department of Transport. 3. Notified under Article 2.9.2. 4. Products covered (HS or CCCN where applicable, otherwise national tariff heading. ICS numbers may be provided in addition, where applicable): Occupant protection systems. 5. Title and number of pages of the notified document: Proposed Amendment to the Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations (pages 4131-4160). 6. Description of content: Modern technology offers two types of occupant restraint system: primary and supplemental. The manual three-point seat-belt system, which consists of a combined lap and shoulder belt anchored to the vehicle in three locations, offers primary protection in that it restrains the wearer and prevents the occupant from being ejected from the vehicle. Air bags, which are usually installed at both the driver and passenger seating positions and automatically deploy in the event of an accident, are designed to offer supplemental protection to the head, neck and chest. Manual seat-belt and air-bag systems are also classified as providing either active or passive protection because seat-belts must be engaged by the occupant while air bags inflate on their own. Research indicates that if certain design refinements made to occupant protection systems over the last decade were available on all vehicles, many of the head, chest, and abdominal injuries that occur on Canadian roadways could be avoided. (1) It is now possible to prevent the driver's head from hitting the steering assembly; to significantly reduce the force of head impacts with the A-pillars, dashboard, and windshield; and to minimize the chest and abdominal injuries caused by incorrectly positioned seat-belts. (2) Many currently available occupant restraint systems already offer such protection; however, in order to ensure that all seat-belt and air-bag systems provide the highest practicable margin of safety, it is necessary that the legislation governing these systems be kept current. 7. Objective and rationale: Protection of human safety. 8. Relevant documents: Canada Gazette, Part I, 2 December 1995. 9. Proposed date of adoption and entry into force: 1 September 1997. 10.

(2) Providing that certain specific equipment in high-pressure gas manufacturing facilities need not take inspections, when manufactured by manufacturers whose manufacturing facilities and inspection facilities comply with the standards set by the Ministerial Ordinance, and attached ``specific equipment inspection qualification certificate''. 7.

Getting a requirements (446 words) CopyrightADVANCED MILITARY COMPUTING via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990Du Pont enters military graphics market     At a time when longtime defense contractors are rushing forthe Pentagon exit, one of America's biggest companies is knockingon the front door.     E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. of Wilmington, Del., isgetting into the defense computer graphics business as part ofits effort in electronic imaging. The company had sales of almost$33 billion last year, and profits of more than $2 billion.     Very little of Du Pont's total sales come from the federalmarketplace. However, the huge company could eventually make asplash in the defense computer graphics world.     "We are the biggest electronic imaging firm in the worldtoday as a result of acquisitions," says Jim Kelley, Manager ofthe Federal Systems Group of Du Pont's Electronic ImagingDivision.     Kelley and his team of eight marketeers in Reston, Va., havestudied and canvassed the federal marketplace for the last year.As yet, they have no defense contracts.     They're not worried.Management sets long-term goal     "Our management has asked us to set up an office anddetermine the possibilities," Kelley said. "They have not givenus a financial target.     "We are still assessing the market."     Du Pont's Electronic Imaging Division has 800 employees inWilmington. In addition, the division owns several othercompanies, including CAMEX, a Boston-based company with productsin the newspaper publishing market, and ImagiTex, a New Hampshirecompany that makes monochrome scanning systems.     Du Pont and Fuji Photo of Japan jointly own CrosfieldElectronics, a British company in the field of color electronicimaging.     The company also owns most of the stock of benchMarkTechnologies, a British company which supplies graphicaccelerators and other high-speed processing systems. Du Pontchanged benchMark's name to Du Pont Pixel Systems.Graphics key in spy photos     The Du Pont products form a complete product line in high-end electronic imagery. The company is not interested in desktoppublishing, which is spreading like a lava flow throughout thefederal government.     The federal government does little color printing. However,color graphics computers are very useful in satellite photowork, simulation and training.     Kelley is optimistic about the prospects for using Du PontPixel computers for processing color images as a part of largersystems that work with spy photos.     Du Pont's role in the field would be to sell the Britishcomputers to systems integration companies in the federal colorgraphics business.     Kelley is optimistic about the intelligence community as amarket in part because it is not hampered by the restrictionsimposed on the rest of the government by Title 44, the basic lawof the Government Printing Office.     Title 44 forces most federal agencies to go outside forcolor image processing and printing. However, the CentralIntelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and other bodiesin the intelligence community are free to seek the best-quality,frequently most expensive systems to manipulate color images.     The Du Pont equipment is not cheap. Many of the productscost more than $100,000 and go up to $250,000 or more.     Kelley says he is confident that Du Pont's stature as awealthy company that can afford to support a long-term effort inthe field will help him sell computers.     In a field where many companies are fast-moving,entrepreneurial and innovative developers in a rapidly-changingtechnology-driven market, Du Pont stands as a 500-lb. gorillathat can afford to wait for profits. The staying power of thecompany reassures customers who fear being abandoned by smallerfry who might go under, Kelley said.     One of the products in the Du Pont Pixel line is the GIPgraphics and image processing system. It is a series of board andsystem level products for use in very high performance graphicsand image processing applications such as command and control.     GIP offers multiple on-screen images, odd-sized and odd-shaped windows, and a very large image memory of 640 megabytes.It runs at 20 million instructions per second as a bit-sliceprocessor and uses an unusual 160 bit-microcode word.     The machine could be used by the military as part of acommand and control system that would use digital map displayswith overlays that required rapid updating and extensive storageand retrieval.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED MILITARY COMPUTING via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990More computer spending waste found     Billions of wasted dollars is all the Pentagon has to showfor many of its computer projects, according to the GeneralAccounting Office.     The congressional watchdog agency blasted the Pentagon formanagement bungling which led to design flaws, misjudgements inrequirements, and sloppy accounting.     Computer spending waste has resulted in the governmentlacking the internal control and accounting systems needed to runprograms and safeguard assets, GAO found.     "Many of the weaknesses are long-standing and have resultedin billions of dollars of losses and wasteful spending," theagency said. "Major government scandals and system breakdownsserve to reinforce the public's perception that the federalgovernment is poorly managed, with little or no control over itsactivities.     "Top level officials must provide leadership if thissituation is ever to change.     For example, the Pentagon owns $29 billion of needless spareparts because of poor inventory controls. That figure hasincreased from $10 billion in 1980.     The Pentagon has also botched its method of furnishingequipment for use by contractors.     The Army has no way of telling what happens to $2 billion ofgovernment furnished material in the hands of contractors.     "These control weaknesses offer the potential for fraud,waste and abuse of government furnished materials," the agencysaid. The Defense Dept. agreed with GAO.     U.S. taxpayers may also have to give millions of dollars toforeign governments because of foulups in the Foreign MilitarySales Trust fund. The Pentagon has known about the problem for 10years but failed to solve it.     After six years of fruitless efforts to clean up the mess inthe overseas sales program, the Pentagon took responsibility forsystem development efforts away from the Defense SecurityAssistance Agency and gave it to the Air Force.     The agency's report on computer waste was titled "FinancialIntegrity Act: Inadequate Controls Result in Ineffective FederalPrograms and Billions in Losses."Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED MILITARY COMPUTING via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990Slow memory bedevils optical computing     NEW ORLEANSOptical computing, a promising newdefense technology that has yet to bear full fruit, apparently ishampered by memory problems.     "Holograms are still slow. That is one thing that willeither make or break optical computers in general," MustafaAbushagur, with the University of Alabama - Huntsville'selectrical and computer engineering department told a laserconference here last week.     But if the speed can be increased, optical memory offersseveral advantages including higher storage density because laserprecision allows the optical bits to be much smaller. Inaddition, optical recording is less sensitive to deterioration orcontamination and less susceptible to head crashing.Japanese press technology     Substituting for well known UAH optical computer expertJohn Caulfield, who was ill, Abushagur told the LASERS' 89conference here that the Japanese are working hard on opticalcomputing and the first applications have come from Japan. "Theyare calling optics the technology of the 21st century," he said.     Abushagur said optical computing in 1989 is comparable towhere electronic computing was in 1949, just before thattechnology took off. "It's poorly developed, unreliable,unstandardized and expensive." He said optics will not replaceelectronics but rather complement it.     He said optical computer researchers' immediate goal is tomake electronic computers faster -- to push the limits ofelectronics. Other goals are to develop an optical supercomputerand exploit the physical differences between optical andelectronic computers to make hybrid systems.Hybrid computing seen     Abushagur said near-term applications of optical computingtechnology include optical data storage, local area networks, andoptical buses. The major mid-term application is development ofhybrid optical-electronic computers.     In the long-term, researchers will have to design "new anddifferent architecture because optics are different and can'thave existing electronic architectures. You have to design andthink differently."     Researchers are working on both distributed andmultiprocessor architectures.     He said optical interconnections could range frommachine-to-machine to gate-to-gate and could include theinterconnection of machines, modules, backplanes, boards, chipsand gates. The use of holographic chip connections offers thepotential of changing the computer's architecture just bychanging the hologram connections. "It can be dynamicallychanging and continue to function," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED MILITARY COMPUTING via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990Soviets seek software exports     The Soviets are looking for ways to gain hard currency andestablish themselves as producers of quality software.     The Space Research Institute of the U.S.S.R. Academy ofSciences is marketing programs for calculating the non-perturbed(Keplerian) or osculating perturbed motions of planets, moons,and stars. The software runs under the MS-DOS operating system.     Keplerian calculations of the motion of celestial bodies arebased on 17th century mathematics. Figuring the perturbed motionsof planets takes into account the complex gravitational effectsof other nearby planets and moons.     Such software should be approached carefully, however. Inthe 1988 Soviet mission to Phobos, a moon of Mars, softwareproblems cropped up. A ground controller sent the wrong commandto one of two probes; the spacecraft moved to a position fromwhich it could no longer be controlled.     The Academy has used the programs to help in design,navigation and dynamic calculation tasks for the Vega mission toHalley's Comet and an X-ray emission experiment on the Mir spacestation.     The Space Research Institute also hawks a video dataprocessing package called SVIT which requires a patented displayterminal. The processor is used for standard image processingjobs like filtering, quality control, statistical analysis,segmentation, and classification. The institute received as manyas 300 orders for the system at the Scientific and TechnologicalProgress Exhibition in Moscow in 1988.Siberians probe signal processing     The Computing Center of the Siberian Branch of the SovietAcademy of Sciences offers the LIBRA-3 library of programs foruse in solving complex problems in mathematical interpolation,and smoothing of functions of several variables on regular andrandom grids, and for signal processing.     Signal processing extremely important in military computing,for target recognition and command and control tasks.     LIBRA-3 is said to be fast because of recent mathematicaladvances, and to be suited for many applications in the basicsciences.     LIBRA-3 has been used to reconstruct surfaces fromaltimetric data, to deblur satellite imagery (smile, U.S.sunbathers!), and in meteorology. Czechoslovakian, Bulgarian, andFrench researchers already use the software package.ICL to computerize Soviet merchantmen     Despite their ability to develop some advanced softwarepackages, the Soviets still lack a broad enough hardware andsoftware base to meet their needs.     Britain's ICL and the Central Scientific Research Instituteof the (vast) Merchant Fleet agreed in Dec. 1988 to form a jointventure to computerize Soviet ships over a three-year period.     ICL spokesperson Ken Howe in London said ICL will providekits that the Soviets will assemble into PCs in Leningrad. TheLeningrad factory, established together with Leningrad localauthorities, will also house software development teams.     Service centers for the PCs and software will be establishedin Vladivostok, Odessa, and Moscow.     Shipboard computers and control technology will be installedto run the ASU-Sudno (automated control and management system)for approximately 600 vessels.Technology advances but problems remain     The Soviets have developed a new multiprocessor called thePS 2100, which reportedly operates in the one billion operationsper second range.     The new machine replaces the PS 2000, which runs at 200million operations per second.     While the new development could signal that Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev's call for a revolution in informationtechnology is finally focusing Soviet efforts on thesupercomputer field.     Mass production of computers in the country is, however,still hampered by the traditional academic approach which leadsto mismatches between the intentions of designers and the needsof computer users in the industrial sector of the Soviet plannedeconomy.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED MILITARY COMPUTING via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990     Electronic countermeasures (ECM), the complex science of     Electronic countermeasures (ECM), the complex science ofjamming enemy signals and foiling electronic attacks, has becomea multibillion-dollar contracting opportunity the past 40 years.     But when war breaks out, such expensive equipment sometimesgoes by the boards.     Panamanian fugitive Manuel Noriega tried to counter theU.S. offensive against his cocaine-financed forces by issuing arallying cry on the radio.     U.S. troops, seeking to counter Noriega's counteroffensive,decided to disable the transmission equipment after he finished.     Instead of turning on massive jammers, they simply blew upthe transmission equipment at the radio station east of PanamaCity.     The tactic squelched the former dictator's propagandawithout using complex computing equipment.     Defense Sec. Richard Cheney said the station had not beenseized early in the Just Cause operation because U.S. plannersgave it a low priority.     Generations of South American coup perpetrators have knownthat taking over the telephone exchange and radio station, aswell as the army barracks and the airport, can give attackersvirtual control of a small country.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED MILITARY COMPUTING via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990     Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistic Support (CALS)     Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistic Support (CALS)computing is taking off in Europe.

Getting a requirements     TRW dials for dollars. Getting a requirementscontract can be a mixed blessing. While the contract figures canbe big, the money doesn't roll in until customers in the militaryactually order the equipment. The people who decide whether andwhat to buy can be spread through out the Pentagon and reachingthem to urge them to buy can be a daunting task.     Joseph Aro, manager of marketing for TRW's networksdivision, has found a successful way to increase sales under theULANA contract. ULANA, which stands for Unified Local AreaNetwork Architecture, is a large Air Force contract for systemsto link computers in offices and other facilities.     "Since June we have used telemarketing into the federalgovernment," Aro said. "We have identified 109 air basesdomestically.     "We have a database of 20,000 names. Ten thousand of themare 'qualified.'" Qualified names are people in the military whomAro's telemarketing team has talked to.     Aro refers to the decision makers his telemarketing staffreaches as "breathers," as compared to non-breathing fax machinesand wrong numbers.     The telemarketing program appears to be increasing sales ofthe TRW systems. Aro's group is shipping 1500 LAN cards permonth, he said.     Aro said he expects the three-year buying window for thecontract will be extended by the government. The ULANA contractwas jointly awarded to TRW and EDS, the General Motors subsidiarythat was founded by Ross Perot, who since has left.     TRW appears to be having more success in actually shippingULANA products than EDS.     In addition to the outgoing telemarketing sales program, TRWis using ingoing telephone lines to service ULANA customers.Callers who cannot be helped by the customer service staff arereferred to an engineer.     Aro's extensive contacts with military buyers of computerslends weight to his assessment of their views of coming defensecuts. He says the military is divided in two groups.     One group fears the budget cuts. "The more skittish believeanybody can lose their job. They think they might be driving atruck (soon).     "Others are charging ahead to get the job done."     Managers of large defense computing projects, in particular,are not worried, he added.     "In hard times, the stronger companies can make it."     TRW hopes to expand its LAN sales into the commercialmarket. It is not a player in the commercial market now. Butcorporate executives believe their quality equipment andmarketing skills will lead to profits in the non-military field.     The founder and motive force behind the division is EdwardSimpson, who is the vice president and general manager of thegrowing division. He holds a doctorate from MIT and spent 15years in the Navy.Back to Headline List WT03-B30-18IA059-000323-B005-30http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/de34.html 205.156.212.5 19970114211238 text/html 14350HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:10:51 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:21 GMTContent-length: 14163Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/de34.html Sample Issue Copyright ARMED FORCES NEWSWIRE SERVICE via NewsNet January 2, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES DEFENSE HEARINGS AND EVENTS (24 words) ARMY COMPLETES BRIDGE ACROSS SAVA RIVER (280 words) DEFENSE SECRETARY TO VISIT UKRAINE FOR DISARMAMENT DEMONSTRATION (228 words) ADMIRAL ARLEIGH BURKE DIES (120 words) PRESIDENT VETOES DEFENSE BILL, OBJECTS TO ABM LANGUAGE (244 words) REJECTION OF COMMERCE SPENDING BILL PRESERVES SOME HOPE FOR ATP (236 words) RUSSIA MISSES CFE TREATY DEADLINE (120 words) NAVY METAL-SPRAY PROCESS MAKES LARGE PARTS ON DEMAND (203 words) TIME IS MONEY IN NAVY'S GBS EFFORT (246 words) CopyrightARMED FORCES NEWSWIRE SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996DEFENSE HEARINGS AND EVENTSDefense Secretary William Perry to visit American forces in Aviano,    Italy as part of a European tour that will include Bosnia,    Hungary and Ukraine.Back to Headline List CopyrightARMED FORCES NEWSWIRE SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996ARMY COMPLETES BRIDGE ACROSS SAVA RIVER     The U.S. Army completed construction of a bridge across theSava River in Bosnia Sunday, opening the gateway for armored forcesto occupy northeastern Bosnia.     Bad weather and flooding during the past week had bedeviledArmy engineers, who had initially planned to complete the bridge byChristmas Day. The setbacks in crossing the river were frustratingArmy commanders, and leading to suggestions of a U.S. deploymentinto Bosnia that was less than the swift show of force promised bythe Pentagon.     By Sunday night, 148 vehicles and more than 500 soldiers hadcrossed the river, including 12 70-ton Abrams tanks -- the first onBosnian soil -- and 41 Bradley Fighting Vehicles of the 1stSquadron of the 1st Cavalry Regiment. The armored vehicles,escorted by helicopters, rolled south into the strategic Posavinacorridor connecting the two large Serb-held portions of Bosnia.     The Sava bridge is the link between U.S. supply bases inGermany and the American headquarters of NATO in the northernBosnian town of Tuzla. Although some 1,500 soldiers and thousandsof tons of equipment had been flown into Tuzla, spanning the Savawas key to bringing most of the 400 armored vehicles needed topatrol the sector and to separate the warring factions.     According to yesterday's edition of The Washington Post,engineers will start work next week on a second bridge to permittwo-way traffic across the Sava.     "This is one step.

On Friday, he joins defense ministers Valery Shmarov ofUkraine and Pavel Grachev of Russia in blowing up an SS-19intercontinental missile silo at the former Soviet missile base atPervomaisk, Ukraine.       The three will also hold talks which could include the riftbetween Ukraine and Russia over control of the former Soviet BlackSea fleet.     It will be Perry's third trip to Pervomaisk, reports Reuters.Since becoming secretary in 1994, he has made repeated visits toUkraine and other former Soviet nuclear states to encourage theirmarch toward non-nuclear status.     "This visit is a truly historic occasion," a senior U.S.defense official told reporters of the Ukraine meeting with Shmarovand Grachev. He noted that both Russia and Ukraine--former Cold Warfoes of NATO - were Bosnia peacekeepers and that the U.S. wasproviding funds to help dismantle the missile base.     The official estimated that 70 percent of the strategicnuclear warheads in Ukraine have now been transferred to Russia andthat over two-thirds of the ICBM's in Ukraine have been removedfrom their silos.

In his veto message, Clinton said he particularly objected toan attempt in the bill by congressional Republicans to compel himto build and deploy a national system of defenses against ballisticmissile attack by 2003.     Clinton said building such a system now would violate the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia and harm arms controlefforts. The bill would have authorized $820 million in 1996 forthe national missile defense program, $450 million more than theadministration requested.     At $265 billion, the measure is only slightly larger than lastyear's defense bill. It is, however, $7 billion more than Clintonrequested.  Defense Secretary William Perry recommended the veto,primarily because of what he considers the wrongheaded missiledefense provision.     From the outset, Clinton opposed policy language in the billrequiring the military to build a system designed to defend U.S.territory against potential attack from missiles. He said it wouldjeopardize continued Russian implementation of the START I nucleardisarmament accord as well as Russian ratification of START II,which has not been ratified by the U.S. Congress either.     In announcing the veto, Clinton also issued an executive orderraising military pay by 2 percent.  The Associated Press reports healso asked Congress to quickly pass legislation bringing the totalpay raise to 2.4 percent, the amount contained in the vetoed bill.Back to Headline List CopyrightARMED FORCES NEWSWIRE SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996REJECTION OF COMMERCE SPENDING BILL PRESERVES SOME HOPE FOR ATP     President Clinton emphatically vetoed a fiscal year 1996funding bill [H.R. 2076] for the Commerce, State and JusticeDepartments December 19, cheering supporters of the CommerceDepartment programs like NIST's Advanced Technology Program (ATP)which had been singled out for elimination by Republicans onCapitol Hill.     "The bill constitutes a short-sighted assault on the CommerceDepartment's technology programs that work effectively withbusiness to expand our economy, help Americans compete in theglobal marketplace, and create high-quality jobs," Clinton scoldedthe House.  He added that he could not accept sharp cuts toprograms such as the NIST-administered Manufacturing ExtensionPartnership.     The veto of H.R. 2076 means Congress will have to reexamineits plans to cut DOC's budget by some $600 million during thefiscal year 1995.  It is unclear whether ATP will be restored aspart of the process, and if so, at what level.     Because Republicans are using the government shutdown topressure the White House to accede to their budget-cutting plans,it is unclear when NIST will receive additional funds.  If it doescontinue to receive funds under another continuing resolution,those would be at the more generous fiscal 1995 level, whichprovides $340 million annually for ATP.  Yet three months after thegovernment's current fiscal year began October 1, today's editionof Technology Transfer Week notes that NIST, like much of the restof the federal government, lack spending authority and remainsclosed.Back to Headline List CopyrightARMED FORCES NEWSWIRE SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996RUSSIA MISSES CFE TREATY DEADLINE     Russia confirmed yesterday that it had failed to comply with aNew Year's deadline for destroying thousands of tanks and othermilitary hardware beyond the Ural Mountains as part of the 1990Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.

Originating at Britain's Osprey Metals Ltd., the process hasbeen improved by NSWC and given an international pedigree,including a Swedish plant funded by the Defense Department and anOhio plant built by a German/Swedish team.     NSWC originally sought the British process to make nickelsuper alloy tubing for new submarines like the Seawolf.  But withthe Navy's traditional suppliers of large metal componentsendangered by defense cuts, NSWC realized that the process could beused rapidly to produce metal components on demand.     NSWC's spray-forming work, funded by an "exploratorydevelopment" core program, has cut pipe production costs 25 percentand boosted product yields up to 25 percent.  Material propertiesexceed those for casting processes and match those for muchcostlier forging and powder-metallurgy products.  Today's editionof Technology Transfer Week reports NSWC's work is funded by thePentagon's "foreign comparative test" program and that the centeris studying spray-formed large-diameter Inconel (iron-cobalt-nickel) piping for use in the Navy's new Seawolf submarine.Back to Headline List CopyrightARMED FORCES NEWSWIRE SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996TIME IS MONEY IN NAVY'S GBS EFFORT     Navy officials are anxious to get permission to give Hughesthe go-ahead to upgrade three military satellites to broadcastvoice, data, and video communications and warn that the longer ittakes to get the effort underway the more expensive it will become.     Hughes is currently under contract to build 10 Ultra HighFrequency Follow-On military communications satellites, but theservice recently decided to modify the last three so they havedirect broadcast satellite capability.     Work on these three satellites - which are known as F8, F9,and F10 - must be accomplished before February 1998 or the servicewill be forced to renegotiate its contract with Lockheed Martin, atan untold cost.  Lockheed Martin is currently under contract tolaunch the satellites on its Atlas Centaur launch vehicle.     "We have a window of opportunity to catch the threesatellites," Capt. Jim Loiselle, program manager for Navycommunications satellites said in a December 8 interview.     The decision to pursue a GBS capability was prompted by awarfighting need to have high bandwidth video and datacommunications capability, but also by the desire of sailors tohave access to television broadcasts and other ties to themainland, according to Navy officials.     Much of the Navy's GBS system will be based on Hughes'commercially available DirecTV system, which has teleconferencingand world-wide television broadcast capabilities.  The Navy system,reports the most recent edition of C4I News, will be encrypted sothat sensitive information can be protected from potentialadversaries.Back to Headline List WT03-B30-19IA059-000323-B005-101http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/de05.html 205.156.212.5 19970114211348 text/html 102334HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:11:09 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:09 GMTContent-length: 102146Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/de05.html Sample Issue Copyright BMD MONITOR via NewsNet MARCH 22, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES BMDO director's update BMDO focused on the road to the future (1270 words) Skipper wired backwards (1107 words) BMDO works the international BMD circuit (796 words) TMD Budget: getting programs operational (295 words) BMDO five-year plan shows restructuring (48 words) Washington Insider O'Neill: theater systems can't take NMD's role (2157 words) Ten years ago ... the more things change ...

Gen. Malcolm O'Neill to write a guest column. He graciously agreed.     Looking back a decade ago in the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, O'Neill was deputy for Programs and Systems under the first SDIO Director, Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson.      Before his appointment as BMDO director in May 1993, O'Neill also served as SDIO, deputy director, and BMDO acting director.     On behalf of the men and women of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) I would like to offer congratulations to the BMD Monitor on the occasion of its 10th anniversary. Since its inception, BMD Monitor has provided its readers -- including myself -- with a host of useful information regarding BMD programs and policies. I wish you continued success.     Ballistic missile defense programs have evolved and changed quite a bit since the first edition of BMD Monitor hit the street 10 years ago, [SDI Monitor, March 1986 -Ed.]  but the basic philosophy has never strayed off course -- the development and deployment of systems necessary to protect against ballistic missile attack.      Ten years ago, we faced the threat posed by the very large strategic missile force deployed by the Soviet Union. Now, the Soviet Union no longer exists. Unfortunately, this threat was rapidly replaced by the continued proliferation of tactical ballistic missiles to other countries, some of whom are potentially hostile to the United States. These short range missiles -- as we saw during the Gulf War -- have become a very dangerous threat to our forces deployed abroad, and also to our friends and allies.     The recently completed BMD Program Review, conducted by Paul Kaminski, the undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, established specific guidance for the BMD program over the next several years and reaffirmed the Defense Department's fundamental priorities for missile defense. The first priority remains defense against theater ballistic missiles, a threat which is here and now. The next priority is to develop the capability that can be rapidly deployed to defend against missiles with the range to threaten the U.S. homeland. Finally, we will continue to develop a technology base to support both Theater Missile Defense (TMD) and National Missile Defense (NMD) as well as other advanced capabilities to round out the BMD Program.     We are putting "rubber on the ramp" today, and will continue to do so in the future. With the continued fielding of the PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC) Guidance Enhanced Missile (GEM) system and an upgraded HAWK system to operational units this fiscal year, we will see a real improvement in our capability -- at a modest investment -- to defend against the short range ballistic missile threat exhibited by the SCUD and similar missiles.     Just as importantly, we have deployed significant improvements to our ability to provide early warning information to U.S. forces overseas in the event of hostile missile launches directed against them. Last year, the Air Force activated the Attack and Launch Early Reporting to Theater (ALERT) squadron using the BMDO-developed TALON SHIELD system at Falcon AFB, Colorado. The Joint Tactical Ground System (JTAGS), also developed by BMDO is a complementary tactical mobile Defense Support Program (DSP) ground station for theater-wide use. Two prototypical units have been deployed by the Army in Germany and South Korea to support the warfighter, and five more units will be deployed in fiscal years 1996 and 1997.     With these near-term improvements in the field, we will continue our efforts to develop and deploy lower-tier systems for TMD, the PAC-3 and Navy Area Defense Systems. These systems will be highly effective against the threat posed by short-to-medium range ballistic missiles of the type under development by North Korea and other countries.      We intend to provide this defensive capability as quickly as possible, building on existing infrastructure and prior investments in ongoing programs. This includes expanding the capabilities of the PATRIOT and AEGIS/Standard Missile systems and adding funds to deal with cost increases and development delays.      We are also working closely with our allies to develop a concept for a cooperative effort for a Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) to protect large, mobile military units in forward locations. A Memorandum of Understanding will be signed this month by the U.S., France, Germany and Italy to jointly execute a program definition and validation phase for MEADS.      A TMD priority is also the improvement of our Battle Management, Command, Control and Communications (BMC3) capability.     In order to ensure funds were available in the near-term to support rapid production and delivery of PAC-3 and Navy Area Defense, as well as to find approximately $2 billion for DoD recapitalization initiatives, the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was reduced in scope, while maintaining focus on ensuring the User Operational Evaluation System (UOES) program was kept on track.      This will provide a system based on the THAAD UOES prototype, in lieu of the previously planned full-capability objective system. This will be more than UOES, a UOES-plus system, with the upgrading of certain components, such as the infrared seeker, radar and BMC3. THAAD will achieve an initial UOES capability in fiscal year 1998, making the system available to an operational commander in a contingency.     The Navy Theater-Wide system will receive an additional $600 million over the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), resulting in a more aggressive development effort and providing the necessary funds for definition of an optimal interceptor concept and a system technology demonstration.     With regard to the future threat posed by ballistic missiles with the capability to reach the U.S. homeland, our goal is to position the U.S. to effectively respond to the threat as it emerges. The Program Review redirected our National Missile Defense (NMD) efforts from a technology readiness program to a deployment readiness program.      We are now focusing our efforts on a program referred to as "3+3," meaning a three year development and planning phase that, if necessary, could be followed by a three year system acquisition and deployment phase. During the three year development phase, BMDO and the Services will begin development and testing elements of an initial NMD system. Based on upon the ballistic missile threat, a decision will be made at the end of the three-year development and testing phase to determine if an NMD system is warranted. If so, an initial defensive capability could be deployed.      Based on this program, initial capability could be achieved in approximately six years, by the year 2003.     Our technology development will also continue in order to meet critical requirements essential to maintaining our technological edge. Since nowhere else in the Department of Defense are these technology programs funded, the strategic investment of these programs in the BMD budget is critical to continued success and viability of the BMD program.     Along with all the men and women of BMDO, the supporting Services and our contractors, I am dedicated to ensuring that we field improved missile defense systems as soon as possible to provide real protection for our forward deployed forces, friends and allies. We have made very strong progress in developing and acquiring improved systems, putting "rubber on the ramp," due to a very strong and enduring Executive-Legislative consensus on TMD.     As many of BMD Monitor's readers may know, I intend to retire from the U.S. Army this year. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as the leader of this vital DOD program. I'm sure the next Director of BMDO will read with great interest -- as I've always done -- the BMD Monitor during the future evolution of this vital national defense program. Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996Skipper wired backwards     The final Bow Shock experiment failed because scientists wired a battery charger backwards.     The joint U.S.-Russian Skipper Flight Experiment was launched Dec. 27, but the craft went dark after only a day (BMDM, 1/12).     BMDO's Innovative Science and Technology Directorate funded the mission: about $7 million for the satellite and another $1 million for operations.     Utah State University scientists had worked with Russian scientists to build the satellite, which was the last of three experiments to investigate the hock flow field in front of the satellite and collect information on ultraviolet emissions in orbit and high-velocity reentry in a 30 day mission.     USU's main engineer for the mission, James Cantrell told the Utah Herald Journal the solar panels designed to recharge the satellite's battery had been connected backward. "They were hooked up in reverse polarity and had the effect of discharging the battery instead of charging it."      "It's always the simple stuff that kills you," he said. "It should have been caught in the design stage but wasn't."     The United National Security Council demands Iraq allow "immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access" for U.N. inspectors, investigating suspected weapons sites. There has been five disputes in 10 days.     "In all of these cases access was subsequently granted only after unacceptable delays," the council said. In a statement read at a formal meeting and approved by all 15 members, the council said the delays "constitute clear violations by Iraq" of several post-Gulf War Security Council resolutions.     Under Gulf War Security Council resolutions, Iraq is obligated to disclose and destroy all stocks and facilities relating to ballistic missile, nuclear, chemical, biological programs.     Rolf Ekeus said the inspectors were searching for ballistic missile components and documents during the five inspections. Analysis continues, but Ekeus reported no dramatic discoveries.     Weapons inspectors must certify Iraq has rid itself of all forbidden weapons.       The first missile tests and show of force off Taiwan were a success, China's state news agency Xinhua said this week.     A second series of exercises, that were to run through the presidential elections on Taiwan this weekend, are on hold due to bad weather.     China is applying psychological pressure to halt any independence moves by Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. Taiwan denies it is seeking independence.     Hong Kong's Beijing-financed Wen Wei Po quoted Chinese military experts as saying it would take just five or six hours for PLA troops to cross the 130-mile strait.     U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry and other U.S. experts have said China does not have the capability to invade Taiwan.     Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said tension with India is a threat to regional peace, citing India's planned development of medium- and long-range missiles.     "Recently, the Indians test experimented a short-range missile and they are planning to develop medium- and long-range missiles. If this happens, Pakistanwould be forced into positions that it does not wish to take," she said in an interview with Reuters Television in Jakarta during a three-day visit.     The PM called on the international community to focus on the subcontinent and help the two countries sort out their disputes just as it had helped in the Middle East peace process, confronted South African apartheid and tried to easetension in Northern Ireland.     She said India and Pakistan have large arsenals, but added that Pakistan was trying to prevent a major arms race in South Asia.     Marking the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's "iron curtain" speech at Westminster College, Mo., former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported ballistic missile defenses.     Thatcher said the world faces more complex dangers than it did a decade ago even though the Cold War is over.     In her March 10 speech, titled "New Threats for Old," Thatcher said "because the risk of total nuclear annihilation has been removed, we in the West have lapsed into an alarming complacency about the risks that remain."     Thatcher called for NATO cooperation against the nuclear threat posed by "rogue" states.     "If America and its allies cannot deal with the problem directly by pre-emptive means, they must at least diminish the incentive for the Saddams, the Gadhafis and others to acquire new weapons in the first place," she said.     "That means the West must install effective ballistic missile defense, which would protect us and our armed forces, reduce or even nullify the rogue state's arsenal and enable us to retaliate."     Thatcher said NATO should implement the missile defense system, and should offer full membership to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.      "NATO provides the best available mechanism for coordinating the contribution of America's allies to global system of ballistic missile defense -- that is, one providing protection against missile attack from whatever source it comes," she said.         When the "Iron Lady" was England's prime minister she was a strong supporter of former President Ronald Reagan's SDI program.     U.N. and African officials said a treaty declaring Africa a nuclear weapons-free zone should prompt the Middle East to do the same.     Signing of the African treaty is expected to begin April 11. It had been negotiated between 1991 and 1995, and 28 states must sign before it enters into force.     Egypt's ambassador to the U.N., while in Geneva, said Israel must first sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.     Under the Treaty of Pelindaba, named after a nuclear site in South Africa, some 53 African states will pledge not to develop, stock or test any nuclear explosive device, dump imported radioactive waste or attack nuclear installations.      Foreign ministers from the five declared nuclear weapon states have been invited to the ceremony. They will be asked to sign a treaty protocol, pledging not to use or threaten to use a nuclear explosive device against any treaty party, or conduct underground test explosions in any territory situated within the African nuclear weapon-free zone.     The African treaty follows similar nuclear-free pacts in Latin America (1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco) and the South Pacific (1986 Treaty of Rarotonga).          Preparations have begun for International Atomic Energy Agency experts to conduct 18 months of investigations at the former French South Pacific nuclear test site of Mururoa on the impact of the tests on the environment.     IAEA experts from 10 countries are due to begin the work in a few months.     in the last 30 years there have been 141 explosions at the atoll, the final six concluded in January to an international outcry.     Future tests will be done by computer simulation, and the test site will be dismantled.     Environmental groups are concerned the tests may have contaminated the atolls and surrounding waters, cracking the atolls' basalt foundation to allow radioactivity to leak out.     French authorities deny the tests caused any damage.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996BMDO works the international BMD circuit     The DoD's international Ballistic Missile Defense effort aims at increasing the effectiveness and compatibility of BMD programs and cutting their costs.     BMDO is the lead agency and contributes funds to the international project, which includes U.S. allies and friends.      The international programs were discussed before Congress this month by BMDO director Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, during a separate briefing by a senior BMDO official and as contained in BMDO's 1995 Report to Congress.     Some of the details are published below.Israel pursues BMD program      Israel has been working with the United States on a BMD program centered around the Arrow missile.     The Arrow/ACES program continues, while the Arrow Deployability Program (ADP), which would integrate the missile, launcher, radar and battle management into an Arrow Weapon System has been negotiated and is ready to be signed (BMDM, 3/8).      A user operational evaluation system-like Arrow system is projected for fielding in fiscal year 1998.     The ADP involves $500 million over five years: $300 million from Israel, $200 million from the United States.     An Israeli Test Bed is also operational.     Since 1994, BMDO and Israel have been working on Boost Phase Intercept (BPI). In fiscal year 1995, BMDO was looking at the Israel concept developed in FY 1994, using simulations and analysis to determine whether coalition force and Israeli concepts had anything in common.      A senior BMDO official said, at a recent briefing for defense reporters, that the BPI project is a $15 million to $20 million program over about three years.U.K. to complete BMD requirements this summer     An 18-month "Pre-Feasibility Study," to define BMD requirements, is expected to be completed this year, probably in June, the BMDO official said. The study will be followed by a policy paper on missile defense.     The United Kingdom has been working on cooperative R&D experiments and joint trials with BMDO.     Also involved are exchanges of scientists and information.     MEADS MOU expected this month     The cooperative agreement among the United States, France, Germany and Italy on the Medium Air Defense System is expected this month, according to O'Neill's testimony before the House National Security Committee March 7.     The Memorandum of Agreement will detail how the four nations will conduct MEADS' definition/validation phase of the program.      The Statement of Intent was signed in February 1995 for a medium-to-low-altitude point and limited area defense for the protection of maneuver forces against the threat of tactical ballistic missiles and air breathing targets, including cruise missiles (BMDM, 2/24/95).Germany to buy Patriot upgrades     Germany is also involved in the acquisition of Patriot Upgrades.     An Extended Air Defense command and control compatibility agreement has been implemented, and an agreement on the Extended Air Defense Test Bed has been approved.      Germany will buy the equipment and software, all off-the-shelf, and Army Space and Strategic Defense Command will install the test bed software. The test bed can be used as a common simulation tool in the Medium Air Defense System program. NATO looks at TMD     NATO is looking at a number of TMD related issues. They include proliferation, active missile defense configurations and costs and battle management, command, control and communications requirements.     A NATO working group, of eight nations, has been set up under the Conference of National Armaments Directors to uncover other TMD cooperative opportunities.     The Netherlands is particularly interested in TMD, and is reviewing requirements to determine how Patriot, Standard Missile-2 Block IVA and Cooperative Engagement Capability might fit the country's needs.Russia works on cooperative programs     Russia is working on joint experiments with the United States, including the recent Skipper Bow Shock experimental satellite launched from Russia in December.     A nonproliferation study, which explores areas of future cooperation, is expected to be conducted.       Another cooperative program is the joint Active Geophysical Rocket Experiment. It will investigate the effects of an explosive plasma jet on the ionosphere and evaluate vehicle environmental interactions.     An experimental satellite program, the Russian-American Observation Stereo Satellites, has been in the works for some time (BMDM, 9/23/94).      French requirements include BMD     Emerging requirements for France include BMD.      France is working with the United States on EAD Simulations and plume phenomenology. Its officials are considering agreements on reentry signature phenomenology and lethality.     Army Space and Strategic Defense Command has presented the EAD Simulation to France, so its scientists can compare it with their own system. It could be used for simulated MEADS exercises and training.     Japan studies BMD     The United States and Japan are cooperating on a bilateral study of BMD, which examines options for defending Japan against regional missile threats.     The Japanese-led study is expected to be completed this year.      Japan is upgrading systems to build a TMD capability. In 1994 it started licensed production of PATRIOT PAC-2, received AEGIS destroyers.     Japan also plans to buy four Airborne Warning and Control aircraft.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996TMD Budget: getting programs operational      The BMDO fiscal year 1997 budget request reflects the recent restructuring from the BMD program review, emphasizing fielding near-term and core TMD programs.     The program review reaffirmed TMD as the top priority: to defend against the existing short-to-medium range mis-siles, followed by adding wide area defenses against the longer range missiles as the threat develops (BMDM, 2/23).     The restructuring will make changes in the previous theater schedule.      In FY 1997, BMDO funding is split 74%, $2.063 billion for theater missile defense, 18%, $508 million for national missile defense, and 8%, $226 million for support technology.     The Army will again consume 60% of the proposed FY 1997 budget. The Navy gets 16%, the Air Force 5%, and other agencies 2%. BMDO's share is 17%.     Responding to congressional questioning about his proposed budget March 7, BMDO boss Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill said moving more money into the program would allow him to conduct more testing, He noted, however, additional money won't speed up all programs.     The Patriot PAC-3 program, for instance, has "fact of life" problems, such as engineering, that money alone can't fix.     O'Neill is also looking for ways that don't necessarily involve money to move the first unit equipped with the THAAD missile system back from the restructuring program date of 2006.      The date moved from 2002 to 2006 after the program review when nearly $2 billion was cut from the program. Putting money back in the program would allow a robust program shakedown sooner.     At a background briefing for defense reporters March 11, a senior BMDO official said the Army is seeking ways to speed up the program, though there are no specifics as yet.     The official said fielding the THAAD system will give the military the first capability to match the threat.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996BMDO five-year plan shows restructuring      BMDO resources for the Future Years Defense Program, fiscal years 1997-2001, expects $10 billion for TMD, $2 billion for NMD and $1 billion for Support Technology.     The change in resource allocation, as envisioned last year for FYs 1995-2001 and this year's plans for FYs 1997-2001, is clear.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996Washington Insider O'Neill: theater systems can't take NMD's role     In his last appearance before the Senate Appropriations Defense subcommittee March 20, BMDO Director Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill said theater systems such as THAAD and Aegis can't fulfill the national missile defense role, now.     Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) asked O'Neill what could be done to protect Hawaii from the missile threat.      O'Neill said the Navy Aegis system cannot defend Alaska or Hawaii against missile attack. The incoming warhead would be travelling too fast.      He said the Aegis radar does not see far enough out, and a THAAD missile can not fly soon enough or high enough to intercept that kind of warhead.     "We do not have enough warning assets to guard against rogue nation threats," O'Neill said, "If you wish to field strategic defense, from a maritime system, you will need to field new spaceborne sensors or airborne radar."     On another subject, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he planned to demand "a complete accounting, line-by-line, or all the funds you expend." Shelby said he had heard reports that BMDO appeared to be growing its own infrastructure at the expense of the services.     This week high winds at altitude scrubbed a planned THAAD intercept test flight at White Sands Missile Range, N.M.     A mid-February attempt was also scrubbed.      It is not the winds at ground level, but higher altitude winds up to 70,000 feet.     If there are high winds at altitude, debris will stray from the range, causing safety problems.     One of the problems encountered is that a shot can't be re-scheduled quickly since White Sands has a lot of on-going activities.      The mobile tactical Defense Support Program ground station Joint Tactical Ground System (JTAGS) office signed the paperwork March 12 with Aerojet to exercise the production option.     The Milestone III meeting was held Feb. 26 and the Program Executive Officer, Missile Defense, gave approval to proceed (BMDM, 1/26).     The Army plans to buy three new JTAGS units and refurbish the two engineering and manufacturing development units. The first new unit will be delivered in October.     The system is slated for fielding in fiscal year 1997.     Two prototype units have been deployed by the Army; one in Germany and one in South Korea.       The U.S. military is on the verge of forming a "system of systems," able to see all relevant enemy assets on the battlefield, communicating this information almost instantly to combat units, and striking at these targets with unprecedented lethality.      That is one of the trends identified in "Strategic Assessment 1996: The Instruments of U.S. Power," the annual assessment done by the Institute of National Strategic Studies of the National Defense University.     The assessment also said increased reliance on military and civilian information systems will require measures to protect these systems from attack.     Another trend noted in the report is that cutting edge research is being done more by the private sector and less by the DoD. There will be an increasing need to adapt commercial developments to military systems.     The assessment was prepared by a 20-member team of civilian and military fellows. It is described by DoD as an independent analysis.     Among its main conclusions the report said DoD has a wider variety of tasks in the post-Cold War period, and is developing a broader range of instruments to manage them.     Another conclusion was public pressure to balance the federal budget could push defense and national security spending below the levels projected by either the administration or Congress. Such a situation might limit theUnited States' ability to continue to exert its influence and protect its interests around the world.     Info: Stuart Johnson, director of research, 202-287-9212.     "The Pentagon has taken a major step in reining in the run-away ballistic missile defense program that needlessly threatened future progress in strategic arms control," Spurgeon Keeny said.     Keeny, president and executive director, The Arms Control Assn., said in an editorial advisory this week the BMD restructuring improves the chances that Russia will ratify START II and further reduce strategic nuclear arsenals.     Keeny said the new TMD program is less threatening to Russia, and should help the United States get Russian agreement on a clarification of acceptable TMD parameters under the ABM Treaty.       Keeny said President Clinton must support the secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff on the restructured program.      While Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., emphasizes experience and responsibility, Keeny said Dole "should not attack a step toward sanity in the ballistic misisle defense program in an effort to create a non-existent ballistic missile defense gap as a campaign issue."     The House Appropriations Committee has added two seats, one Republican and one Democrat. That makes the partisan ratio 33-25.     The addition of a New York Democrat, Jose Serrano, comes because Rep. Mike Parker, Miss., bolted to the Republican side last November.     Serrano will be back in the seat he lost after Republican leaders reduced the Democratic seats to make the committee ratio reflect overall partisan House ratios.     The House has adopted the State Dept. Authorization bill conference report, but the bill faces an uncertain future.     The White House has said the president would veto the bill, out of strong disagreement over a provision to eliminate one of three independent foreign affairs agencies:  the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the Agency for International Development and the U.S. Information Agency.      The eliminated agency would be folded into the State Dept. But Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms,' R-N.C., has proposal dumping all three agencies.     Senate Democrats have said they might filibuster when the bill comes to the floor.          Ceremonies in Huntsville, Ala., last week marked the changeover from Brig. Gen. Richard Black to Col. (P) Dan Montgomery as Program Executive Office, Missile Defense.               Flags, bands and some 600 people attended, including BMDO Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill and Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, boss, Army Space and Strategic Defense Command.          The 1996 BMDO program briefing to industry and government has been moved to April 9-10 at the State Dept. (BMDM, 3/8).     Only those with a current Secret clearance may attend. According to the American Defense Preparedness Assn., which supports the briefing, the classification is "to allow briefer to share more details and sensitive aspects of the threat, program and future action visions."     BMDO will provide a program review with presentations and discussions on timely, relevant activities affecting BMDO, the latest TMD initiatives, the current status of the NMD program and ABM treaty impacts/updates.     Speakers include Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology Paul Kaminski, and Air Force Gen. Joe Ralston, Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.      There will also be a forecast of expected contract opportunities for the current and upcoming fiscal years.     The conference is aimed at U.S. industry and government missile defense decision makers, scientists, and program planners in R&D, contracting, and marketing.      Small and disadvantaged businesses are also encouragedto attend.      Info: ADPA Service Center, 703-522-1820, fax 703-522-1885. Request information on event #614.     Senate Republicans are raising the stakes on missile defense this election year.     Majority leader and presidential candidate Bob Dole, R-Kan., and 26 of his colleagues wrote President Clinton that "we will not hesitate to alter the budget request" to bring it in line with the Fiscal Year 1996 Defense authorization act provisions.     The Senators cited their strong support of BMD and commitment to future funding of the Space and Missile Tracking System, THAAD and Navy Upper Tier.     Their displeasure with the president's budget request comes in funding levels for THAAD and Navy Upper Tier, which they write are "insufficient."     The March 7 letter was also signed by Strom Thurmond, S.C., chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee; Jesse Helms, N.C., chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Committee; John Warner, Va.; Richard Shelby, Ala.; Ted Stevens, Alaska; Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas; Spencer Abraham, Mich.; Conrad Burns, Mont.; Rick Santorum, Penn.; Bob Smith, N.H.; Mike DeWine, Ohio; Paul Coverdell, Ga.; Connie Mack, Fla.; Don Nickles, and James Inhofe, Okla.; John McCain and Jon Kyl, Ariz.; Thad Cochran, Miss.; Larry Craig, Idaho; Charles Grassley, Iowa; Rod Grams, Minn.; John Ashcroft, Mo.; Mitch McConnell, Ky.; Orrin Hatch, Utah; Al Simpson, Wyo.; Trent Lott, Miss.      The Union of Concerned Scientists continues to push the other side of the NMD issue.     UCS said calls for the United States to get out of the ABM Treaty would shake U.S.-Russian relations, and impede arms control efforts such as strategic arms reduction.     The UCS also said Republicans such as Rep. Curt Weldon, Pa., and Sen. Strom Thurmond, S.C., are trying to make missile defenses an election year issue.     Last year UCS wrote to Congress that the push for a national missile defense is based on ideology not sound science or policy, and that efforts to resurrect NMD are "misguided and irresponsible."          Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Norman Wood has been appointed president and CEO, Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Assn. effective April 1.     Wood succeeds retired Adm. James Busey IV, who is retiring after more than three years as AFCEA president and CEO.     Wood joins AFCEA from BDM Federal Inc., where he was senior vice president and general manager, responsible for management of national security and technology applications programs, resources and marketing, focusing on the intelligence community.     A minimum sentence of 10 months in prison was imposed on two peace-activists for vandalizing Trident missile shells at a Lockheed Martin factory last August (BMDM, 8/11/95).      Federal district judge James Ware imposed sentence on Susan Crane and Steven Kelly, saying they had acted out of sincere beliefs, "but nevertheless, you violated the law."     He urged them to "work with the law or try to change it."     Crane and Kelly were convicted of conspiracy and vandalism after jumping a fence at Lockheed Missiles and Space in Sunnyvale, hammering two missile shells and splattering them with their own blood.   Because they have spent seven months in custody after refusing bail, they will serve only three months in prison, then two years on probation.   The Assistant U.S. Attorney said the sentence was lenient for the nearly $400,000 damage done to the missile shells.      About 100 supporters packed the courtroom, singing "We Shall Overcome" before the hearing and giving the defendants a standing ovation afterward.     The former KGB general who targeted U.S. rocket fuel formulas and his Cold War antagonist have gone Hollywood.     Oleg Kalugin and former CIA director William Colby play themselves in a new interactive CD-ROM game, "Spycraft: The Great Game."     In the game, a politician, vaguely resembling nationalist presidential candidate Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is shot in Red Square. Players have to figure out who did itwith help from Colby and Kalugin, who join forces to save civilization from the Russian mafia.     To solve the case, players are shown a dazzling array of gizmos, including satellite imagery, sound detection devices and weaponry that would make James Bond's armorer envious.     "We have many kinds of games used in the government for training and to stretch the minds a bit," said Colby. "Those games are normally strategic. This one is at the case officer level."     Something new is that the Spycraft player can go on the Internet and access the graphic Web pages for the real CIA, FBI and other federal agencies, using Intelink, a fictional intelligence communications network that really goes online.   Through the online feature, the game blends real world news reports with fictional scenarios in playing time that can last up to 40 hours. The game is out this month.     The McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper-Experimental Advanced (DC-XA) rolled out of the Huntington Beach, Calif., site March 15.     The next stop for the single-stage-to-orbit vehicle is White Sands Missile Range, N.M., where it will be prepped for flight tests that are to start in May.     The prototype DC-X was developed under BMDO direction, and is now being developed under a cooperative agreement between NASA and McDonnell Douglas to demonstrate new technologies needed for a reliable, affordable reusable launch vehicle that could be operated commercially by American industry with NASA as one  of its customers.      DC-XA project manager Dan Dumbacher, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala., said "this is a radically different vehicle from the DC-X that flew last year... ."      The DC-XA will be the first rocket ever to fly with a  composite hydrogen tank. The tank, built by McDonnell  Douglas, is made of graphite-epoxy and is 1,200 poundslighter than the aluminum tank used in the DC-X.      The flight tests will demonstrate the hydrogen tank's performance as well as other new advanced technology components, including a Russian-built aluminum-lithium alloy liquid oxygen tank; a composite intertank to connect the hydrogen and oxygen tanks; and an auxiliary propulsion system consisting of a composite liquid hydrogen feedline, a composite liquid hydrogen valve and a liquid-to-gas conversion system in the flight reaction control system.     Air Force Phillips Lab will manage flight test operations.      NASA's investment in the DC-XA program is $20 million for hardware and $30 million for integration.       NASA's Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va., and Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif., also support DC-XA.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996Ten years ago ... the more things change ...     Saturday, March 23 is the 13th anniversary of President Ronald Reagan's "star wars" speech, which was the impetus for the Strategic Defense Initiative.     Since then, SDIO was refocused from a strategic, space oriented organization to the BMDO, with its focus on theater missile defense. BMDO just finished refocusing the program.     Some things never change -- the tug of war over the budget.     In March 1986, SDIO was adjusting its fiscal year 1986 budget to close the gap between the Reagan administration's $3.7 billion request and the final congressional appropriation of $2.75 billion.      Half the billion in cuts came from sensor experiments, delaying or cancelling a boost surveillance and tracking system demonstration as well as a comprehensive flight experiment for the space surveillance and tracking system.     The FY 1987 budget request was $4.8 billion.     The SDIO FYs 1986-1987 program emphasized the ground-based laser;  continued Kinetic Energy Weapons such as ERIS, HEDI; sensor technology and database collection experiments (not prototypes); architectural definitions of systems; battle management, command, control and communications, its impact on architectures and the national test bed; survivability and lethality experiments and interactive discrimination.     SDIO's Innovative Science and Technology FY 1986 funding was $98.6 million. For 1987, SDIO wanted to request about $140 million, a 42% increase.     The hot topics in 1986 were advanced high-speed computing, sensing, discrimination and data processing, space science and experimentation, advanced space power experimentation, directed and kinetic energy concepts and materials structures and propellants.     Deputy IS&T Director Dwight Dustin (now Assistant Deputy for Technology) said SDIO was interested in laser satellite networking and micro-refrigeration techniques for IR sensors, and might look at starting work on a boost phase discrimination technique, spotting hard bodies rather than plumes.     Theater ballistic missile defense was one of the configurations being examined by SDIO's systems architecture study.     SDIO officials said that while tactical missiles allow less warning time than ICBMs, their slower speeds would ease some of the requirements for intercept.     Boost phase and midcourse ATBMD intercepts could be done by space-based components of an SDI-constellation.     The American Defense Preparedness Assn. and SDIO presented the Homing Overlay Experiment with the 1986 "strategic defense technical achievement."     The award came at a black-tie commemoration of the third anniversary of President Reagan's March 23, 1983, speech that called for research on ballistic missile defense.     Paul Nitze, special advisor to Reagan, cited the technical achievements of SDI as an opportunity to establish "a more stable form of deterrence for American and global security concerns."     While the SDI was an open program, in January 1986 things started to get tight - all SDIO visitors had to check in at a visitor control center to get badges if they wanted to visit SDIO officials at the downtown Washington offices.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996Missile defense gets its own 'Skunk' worker     Two-time Grammy winner Jeff "Skunk" Baxter has been tapped to lead a new Citizens Advisory Panel on Missile Defense.     At a press conference held hot on the heels of budget testimony by BMDO director Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill March 7, Curt Weldon, R-Pa., Research and Development subcommittee chairman, announced Baxter will help organize the panel.     Baxter, the former Doobie Brothers guitarist and founder of Steely Dan is a long-time friend and advisor to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif.     Weldon, flanked by (as was said, "there's Pink Floyd and the real") Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman, House National Security Committee, and missile defense supporter Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., said the panel will help educate people about America's vulnerabilities from missile attack and need for national missile defense.      The panel also will encourage members of Congress to hop on the missile bandwagon.     "We need all the help we can get," Spence added.     Baxter said his job is to bring together everyone who has anything to say about missile defense. Including those who tinker with technology in their workshops -- no just the big defense contractors.        Baxter said missile defense technology is available, and a national missile defense is affordable. The country can't afford to be without the protection, he added.      A deployed system also broadens the options for political leaders, he said.     Baxter, who has 16 gold records and eight platinum, lives in Beverly Hills, and wrote the original main theme of "Beverly Hills, 90210," said his role as entertainer is double-edged, and it attracts attention.     "First of all, you're here," he told the room full of reporters, Capitol Hill staffers and others. He also noted that the music industry is very high-tech, involving computers, data storage and digital communications -- much of which evolved from the defense industry.     He first became involved in missile defense because of his work on guitar design, through an SDIO project at Lawrence Livermore National Lab on microwave radar, now applied in guitar amplifiers. From his self-generated interest in missile defense issues, Baxter has written Op-Ed pieces and position papers on the ABM Treaty and NATO and lectured on "The Future of Ballistic Missile Defense.     The missile panel is yet to become a formal entity. But Baxter said he envisions a "website" or clearing house for missile defense information available to members of congress and the public.

But none called for the immediate dumping of the treaty by the United States.      There were former CIA director R. James Woolsey, former assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Policy Richard Perle, and the president of the Henry L. Stimson Center Michael Krepon. All said the ABM Treaty could be revisited.      The hearing was part of the committee's effort to consider treaty issues as it weighs the president's fiscal year 1997 budget request for ballistic missile defense.Woolsey has reservations about ABM Treaty     Woolsey said he would "defer" for now whether the United States should consider withdrawing from the treaty.      Woolsey said with a firm negotiating approach to the Russians and enough funding for BMD programs, "we should be able to accommodate our needs within the treaty for some time if it is appropriately interpreted and, possibly, modified."     A cooperative approach of treaty modification and cooperative programs could be one way to go, he added.     As part of this cooperative effort "we might be willing to supply the Russians, as well as other nations, with data from our space-enhanced sensors such as Brilliant Eyes," Woolsey added.Perle: ABM question is one of policy, not law     Richard Perle told the committee instead of negotiating limits on theater missile performance, the United States should simply state theater defenses are not covered under the ABM Treaty.     Perle said if the Russians said the theater defense program violates the treaty they can file a complaint with the Standing Consultative Commission, while the United States continues developing TMD.     It is a policy matter, not a legal issue, Perle said. The threat of a Soviet missile attack on the United States that the treaty is concerned with is now irrelevant, he added. Now the danger is in a theater missile acquisition or attack on deployed troops and allies.     Perle urged congress to insist on revising the ABM Treaty under its own provisions, and "under no circumstances" limit the effective deployment of theater systems.No compelling reason to dump the treaty     Krepon said "the ballistic missile threat provides no compelling reason to trash President Nixon's handiwork.     Krepon said the treaty should not be considered set in stone, but as a living document that can be amended.     The treaty is a safety net for U.S.- Russian relations, Krepon said, for without it, tensions would continue, cooperation would be difficult, and START II Treaty arms reductions would become difficult.     National Missile Defense, Krepon said, is the last line of defense. The front lines include global efforts such as counterproliferation, diplomacy and transparency, backed by conventional forces. The last line of defense is intercepting missiles and warheads in flight.     Krepon urged congress to increase spending in other missile defense areas, noting "we are spending extremely large sums for the last fifteen minutes of the problem, while short-changing the front lines of defense against weapons of mass destruction."Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996Heritage Foundation team updates missile defense report     Led by former SDIO Director Henry Cooper, the Heritage Foundation's Team B missile defense study squad has updated its 1995 report on the missile defense of the United States and its troops.     The update of "Defending America: A Near- and Long-Term Plan to Deploy Missile Defenses" (BMDM, 6/16/95) again calls for the United States to consider withdrawing from the ABM Treaty and adopting a two-tier, Theater Missile Defense (TMD)/National Missile Defense (NMD) plan by building sea- and space-based missile protections.     As BMD Monitor went to press, legislation was expected to be filed on National Missile Defense and the ABM Treaty, March 21.      The top priority should be expanding Navy Upper Tier for deployment, beginning in 2000 as the earliest, for defense of the continental United States and deployed troops, the new report said.     The differences between Team B's and the Clinton administration's views continue to be well defined. The update and the 1995 report concluded "the threat is clear, present and growing; and that it demands an urgent response."      The administration, however, does not believe the threat is imminent. Unclassified reports on the latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) suggest the threat is years away and there is sufficient time to build defenses before the threat materializes.     The difference has caused Republicans to call the NIE "politicized."Funding plan offered for FYs 1996-2001     Team B offered their own funding recommendations for missile defense systems from fiscal Years 1996 through 2001 (see chart above).     Additional funds this year could be found by shifting NMD funds from ground-based to sea- and space-based programs. Update offers recommendations     The update offers recommendations for Congress to consider as the fiscal year 1997 budget evolves on Capitol Hill:     -- Review the administration's ballistic missile threat assessment and direct a more prudent approach to accelerate the development of appropriate responses.     -- Review the ABM Treaty limits, and insist the most effective, affordable near-term defenses be developed without treaty constraints at an accelerated pace.     -- Move the United States to withdraw from the ABM Treaty after six months notice.     -- Redirect last year's consensus objective of deploying ground-based defenses for the United States by 2003 and focus on deploying of sea-based, wide-area defenses by 2000 without ABM Treaty constraints.     -- Direct the Air Force to accelerate Brilliant Eyes deployment, starting as early as 1999, develop follow-on space-based defenses for deployment early in the next decade, including kinetic energy interceptors and space-based lasers.     -- Direct the Army to focus on developing and deploying ground-based TMD to support U.S. troops and allies overseas, restore the $2 billion removed from THAAD, and make 2000 as the initial deployment date.     -- Ensure BMDO develops an open, integrated architecture for battle management, command, control and communication.

This recommendation is from The Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the United States Intelligence Community.           The commission released its report March 1 in Washington, and briefed the president and other administration officials last week after a year-long effort to define intelligence area reforms and reorganization.      Commission staff member Douglas Horner discussed the report in a March 12 briefing sponsored by Open Source Solutions, Rosslyn, Va.     The commission recommended DoD set an authority under DoD's assistant secretary of Defense, Command, Control Communications and Intelligence. The authority would cut across intelligence, surveillance and command, control and communications functions.     The panel noted intelligence is useless if it doesn't get to military commanders in a form useful form for targeting and delivering precision weapons, for example.     "It is imperative, therefore, that intelligence support to military operations be synchronized with global command, control and communications systems," the report said.      In its review, the commission found many areas of DoD are working the problems, but there is no central authority.The authority would coordinate with groups to provide the recommendations and unified effort needed for combat.DoD should snip overlaps     The commission also recommended DoD examine the intelligence analytical and production organizations within the services and the Unified Commands to eliminate overlap.     The commission expressed concern about the size of the organizations and "with what appears to be the tendency to exceed their core missions."     The commission cited other issues associated with military intel budget decisions, compatibility, dissemination, and the growing pressures on tactical and national processing resources.      Satellite collection systems and precision weapon systems still need to be integrated, the report said, noting simulations to assess the performance and cost-effectiveness of intelligence capabilities are limited.     A controversial recommendation puts DoD clandestine recruitment of human intelligence sources under the CIA.Congress works on draft legislation          Senate Intelligence Oversight Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Vice Chairman Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., are working the report's major recommendations into draft legislation (SI 593) to be marked up next month.      House Intel Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas, is drafting related legislation (IC 21).

Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996New aerostat CMD office takes off     Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology Paul Kaminski is slated April 4 to hear the plans for the new joint Aerostat Program Office for Cruise Missile Defense.      Meanwhile, the skeleton staff is working in assigned office space at the Army Space and Strategic Defense Command headquarters, Huntsville, Ala., which has operational control of the office.     The staff is examining the lessons-learned and after action report on the performance of an aerostat that passed fire control info to a Marine Corps Hawk battalion in the recent Mountain Top experiment in Hawaii.     While people tend to focus on the lighter-than-air tethered aerostat, the advanced sensors, which the aerostat will carry aloft, are the focus and more challenging part of project. The challenge includes detecting, tracking and relying accurate fire control info on land-attack cruise missiles.      The aerostat office may participate in Roving Sands '96, the annual joint air defense exercise held at Fort Bliss, Texas.BMDO involved in CMD     For more than a year, DoD has been discussing land-attack cruise missile defense. However, BMDO has no formal tasking orders, a senior BMDO official told reporters March 11.     Testifying before Congress March 7, BMDO director Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill said many TMD sensors, battle management and weapons systems have an effective capability to counter the emerging land-attack cruise missile threat.     The big picture, the system of systems command and control architecture, is being designed to be flexible so to accommodate cruise missile defense.      In particular, O'Neill said, Patriot PAC-3, Navy Area Defense and the Medium Extended Area Defense System operate in the same battlespace and will have "significant capability" against the threat.     The National Missile Defense battle management, command, control and communication architecture will also be designed to promote compatibility and evolve into a common system for ballistic and cruise missile defense.     O'Neill, before the House National Security Committee, and Kaminski, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, described other initiatives, including advanced technology sensors, upgrades to airborne platforms and the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration of the aerostat sensor platform and interceptor upgrades, being worked outside of BMD. Inexpensive ways to solve the problem     For defenders cruise missiles can cause more than headaches. The missiles fly below the coverage of surface-based systems.     But an Army official told BMD Monitor the new trick for combating cruise missiles involves elevating sensors, implementing the concept of Air-Directed Surface-to-Air Missiles. This means that an airborne sensor, hooked to an aerostat, provides sufficient fire control and update info to engage targets before ground-based systems detect them.     Elevated sensors regain the battlespace lost by below surface system coverage due to the curvature of the Earth and terrain masking.     The elevated sensors are expected to detect land-attack cruise missiles further out -- looking down over the terrain, picking up targets and relaying the information to surface-based shooters.     Sensor-carrying aerostats have advantages over Airborne Warning And Control (AWACS) and Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft (JSTARS) because the aircraft are performing other missions.     JSTARS and AWACS add assets to missions, the Army official said, but are not as cost-effective as aerostats with sensors. Other solutions are not considered affordable at this time.     In a Desert Shield environment, for instance, the official said, where there is limited activity for six months or more, an aerostat platform reduces the need for costly  fixed-wing aircraft.      Since the Army is concerned with a high operational tempo and maneuver issues, the elevated sensors can fill specific niches. Also such systems could be integrated with fixed-wing aircraft such as AWACS or JSTARS.     The mix would come about as technology matures, the official said, and the architecture becomes integrated (BMDM, 2/9).Technical sensor questions studied     The technical work of the aerostatoffice centers on sensors, the official said. There is already a lot of information available on aerostats.     The program office will determine payloads, flight requirements of up to 20,000 feet, range and visibility -- in determining the correct size of the aerostat.     The office is considering mobility of the platform. The design of mooring systems is in its infancy, the official said, adding in the past there has been no requirement to develop mobile mooring systems.     Analysis will examine the most cost-effective system.       The details on how the sensor information will be integrated must be worked out, but the Army official said it is clear the platform must support joint forces.     Other issues being examined include how the platform will fit into theater battle management, and what links will pass the information.     Also under review is whether the information can be passed from the sensor directly to the shooter.      Other mission areas that the aerostat platform could address are being examined, but the primary focus is on detecting land-attack cruise missiles. Forget 'pop' goes the aerostat     An aerostat is not as vulnerable as uspected, the official said. "While any system has vulnerabilities, people tend to believe that if they put a bullet in an aerostat it flies around like a birthday balloon and pops. But that's not so."     It is extremely difficult to bring one down with bullets, he added.      And emissions from the sensors are no more vulnerable than those of other sensors, he added.     The weather should not be a major concern since the aerostat is planned to fly at 15,000-20,000 feet altitude.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996Dwindling BMDO technology program creates concern      BMDO's technology program is the seed for upgrades, sprouting new systems, but the agency is having a hard time nurturing the technology garden.     During congressional testimony before congress this month, Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, BMDO's director, said demands on BMD resources and the number of congressional earmarks have risen. "I am concerned that because of this we have been forced to reduce our technology program."     The Advanced Technology program is the third priority for BMDO behind Theater Missile Defense and National Missile Defense. The proposed fiscal year 1997 funding allocation is $184 million, or 6% of the BMDO budget. The missile defense program review allocates $1.2 billion from FY 1997-2001.     O'Neill said past technology developments have made today's acquisition programs possible, citing the "hit-to-kill" technology used by the Patriot PAC-3 missile. It evolved from the SDIO Flexible Lightweight Agile Guidance Experiment of the mid-1980s.     BMD program restructuring has squeezed the technology program. Under SDIO, nearly 90% of the program was geared to technology research. The push to acquisition and deployment pushed the research part of the budget below the 15%-20% levels the services traditionally allocate to science and technology (BMDM, 3/10/95).      Of concern to BMDO managers is the ability to respond with new technology to fix system problems or for countermeasures.     One committee member noted that last year the technology budget was considered "bare bones." This year O'Neill said Congress should think of the Advanced Technology program as a "strategic investment," which he considers critical to the continued success of the BMD program.     O'Neill will provide a written response to the "how much do you need" questions from committee members.Evolving threat guides the program     He told the committee the pace and direction of the advanced technology program is directed at the threat. BMDO has identified the most critical technology requirements.     More needs to be done, and could be done with added funding, O'Neill said.      He ran down a short-list of work that could be accomplished with additional money -- doing more on the space based-laser program, upgrading power radar transmit/receive modules, communicating with interceptors in flight over the horizon and advancing interceptor and propulsion technology.     BMDO could also work with Australia on netting long- range sensors, a program that now lacks funds.      Unique requirements for component support to programs such as Patriot, Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, AEGIS, ground-based interceptor, ground-based radar and the Space and Missile Tracking System. They include:     ** Sensor and seeker programs to improve range and resolution in the areas of: dim objects; low-noise, low-vibration, 10-year life radiation tolerant; improvedtracking accuracy; countermeasures resistant; and solid-state radar modules.     ** Interceptor components to develop light, fast, smart, highly capable long-range missiles that can find small, cold targets.     ** Battle Management, Command, Control and Communication high-data and low-error component technologies for automated decision aids, data fusion, adaptive defense operations and secure communications.     ** Phenomenology to determine how the threat, environment and defensive systems will behave and interact during engagement, involving such things as discrimination.New options for the future     The advanced concepts work in the technology program looks to the future TMD and NMD, creating new options such as:     ** Directed-Energy Boost Phase Intercept -- high payoff leap-ahead technology vs. the evolved threat.     ** Airborne Kinetic Energy Boost Phase Interceptor -- to defend against countermeasures and avoid collateral damage.     ** Innovative Science & Technology and Small Business Innovative Research, to accelerate the application of breakthrough science.     Developing technologies to meet these critical requirements is essential to maintain the program's technology edge, O'Neill said. DoD is not funding basic or component BMD technology anywhere else, he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996Laboratory Notes Starfire Optical Range uses Comet as a target     Air Force Phillips Lab Starfire Optical Range (SOR) will use its 3.5 meter telescope, the largest in the DoD, and Laser Guide Star technology to get images of Comet Hyakutake as it passes the Earth March 25.     This is not just an astronomy exercise. SOR will use the comet as a moving target to further test the Laser Guide Star adaptive optics technology.     The Lab plans to capture computerized photos of thecomet and put them on the Internet for astronomers and the general public. Almost immediately after being taken, photos will be available through the Internet at   http://wwwsor.plk.af.mil\.     Lab officials note weather conditions might prevent them from getting images. Phillips' lasers, computers and adaptive optics were linked to a 1.5-meter telescope and used to eliminate the distorting effects of the atmosphere.     The Hyakutake Comet approaches Earth at about 36 miles per second, nearly 130,000 miles per hour, passing us within 9.3 million miles.     The Naval Research Lab's Naval Center for Space Technology has developed a mission planning and analysis tool for Earth-Orbiting Satellites.     NRL engineers Jay Middour and Alan Hope and      AlliedSignal engineer Steven McLaughlin turned the Orbit Analysis Tools Software (OATS) into a single integrated program that runs on a Mac.     OATS version 4.0 uses numerical and graphical techniques to analyze and display Earth coverage data and has the ability to generate satellite ephemerides, using one of four orbit propagators.     A copy of the user's manual for OATS and the OATS version 4.0 executable program and related files are available on internet via Internet at <>.     Los Alamos National Lab offers direct access to near real-time data from its Array of Low Energy X-Ray Imaging Telescopes (ALEXIS) satellite through a new site on the World Wide Web.     The Web site,  allows astronomers to check satellite data against observations from the ground.     ALEXIS was launched nearly three years ago to survey the sky for bursts of extreme ultraviolet photons, called EUV transients. Scientists want to identify the sources of these bursts and learn more about them (SDI Monitor, 5/7/93).     The craft scans half the sky with its three paired sets of EUV telescopes, but it cannot locate any events with high- resolution.      Ground-based astronomers, including amateurs and students - can take part by looking for visual counterparts to the EUV transients seen by ALEXIS by comparing observations made at two different times.       Large telescopes, with their small fields of view, cannot scan a large enough piece of the sky fast enough to effectively observe transients seen by ALEXIS, but amateur equipment is well suited to the task.     ALEXIS orbits about 500 miles above Earth, passing over Los Alamos four times a day, delivering its collected data to a computer at its ground station. The entire system is managed by about 10 people.    The 240-pound, $20 million satellite includes six coffee-can-sized EUV telescopes with curved multilayer coated mirrors that reflect and focus low-energy X-rays the way optical telescopes focus visible light (BMDM, 1/28/94).Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996BMDO joins with DoD for science research awards     DoD plans to award $20 million to 35 academic institutions in 19 states for research in science and engineering keyed to national defense.     Sixty-four scientists were competitively selected under the Fiscal Year 1995 Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.      The awards average $312,500. They are intended to expand research opportunities in states that have traditionally received the least funding per capita in federal support of university research.     Proposals supported by BMDO include:      ** Auburn University Physics Dept. for the development of high-intensity UV, VUV and X-ray lasers based on the novel concept of Dressed Atomic States in Plasmas.

When the deal is done Raytheon expects to have an ownership position in Whittaker just shy of 20%.     Xyplex designs, makes, markets and supports solutions for distributed client/server Local Area Networks.     Last year Xyplex's generated about $100 million in revenues.     Raytheon doesn't expect the sale to have any impact on its 1996 performance.      Lockheed Martin Chairman Dan Tellep was named California Manufacturer of the Year at a dinner sponsored by the California Manufacturers Association Monday night in Sacramento this week.     Governor Pete Wilson presented Tellep with the award before  most of the state's top officials and some 100 legislators.      Wilson called Tellep "a leader of the state's business community and a vital contributor to the regional economy."     "Under Dan's guidance, Lockheed Martin has repositioned itself  from  the Cold War to a leadership role in today's emerging new information markets," he said.      Accepting the award, Tellep said that he was proud and  appreciative in both a personal sense, having lived inCalifornia for 45 years, and because Lockheed Martin continues to maintain a solid presence in the state.     He noted that since the Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger and  the company's pending acquisition of parts of the Loral Corporation, Lockheed Martin will continue to be one of California's largest private employers.     "It will probably surprise you to know that today just half  of business is with the U.S. Department of Defense. We're doing more in a broad variety of high technology areas such as  information systems in a business that has played such a powerful role in California's economic growth.     Tellep began his career in 1955 as a principal scientist for the X-17 missile reentry flight experiments at Lockheed Missiles & Space Company.     At the end of last year, Tellep retired as an active employee of Lockheed Martin, but will remain chairman of the board through 1996.      When Tellep retired as CEO, the company announced a $1 million endowment for the Daniel M. Tellep  Distinguished Professorship in the College of Engineering at his alma mater, the University of California at Berkeley.     The House Small Business Committee has discussed the future of the Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Pilot Program.     The STTR program will end September 30, unless Congress reauthorizes it.      During a March 6 hearing, committee members questioned the need for STTR, since it is similar to the SBIR program. Witnesses urged continuation of both programs, which they said were different but complimentary.     Digital Systems Resources' president Richard Carroll said the programs have become "our best and most effective alternative in the era of a shrinking U.S. defense budget, which has had enormous negative impacts on high-tech small businesses."     In fiscal year 1996, $980 million will be awarded to small businesses: $930 million via SBIR, $50 million under STTR.     Thomas G. McInerney, a former Loral vice president and retired Air Force general, has been elected president and CEO of Business Executives for National Security.     BENS is a national, nonpartisan organization of business and professional leaders. The organization works to engage the business community in defense security issues.     McInerney plans to focus on innovative business solutions to improve defense security.      "We have too much `tail' and not enough `teeth,'" he said, adding "BENS is ideally qualified to help our military fix that."     John Capellupo, president, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, has been named this year's winner of the Navy League's Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz Award.     Capellupo will receive the award at the Navy League's Sea-Air-Space Exposition April 3 in Washington.     He is cited for outstanding contributions to the U.S. maritime force.     Honeywell has signed a letter of intent to acquire Smiths Industries' fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) technology and products business.     The acquisition will strengthen Honeywell's FOG technology and position it to extend its product offerings.     Honeywell is a leading developer and maker of optical gyro-based products for military and aerospace applications, and is developing advanced FOG technology and products for new applications.     Raytheon is negotiating with Army Missile Command for Patriot remote launch communications enhancement upgrades and long-lead parts and materials.     The work will support a limited procurement authority for the incorporation of improved technology into the Patriot Air Defense System.     Army Space and Strategic Defense Command spent $1.2 billion on procurement in fiscal year 1995.      Small disadvantaged business procurement awards accounted for $82 million, or 6.7% of the tab.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996     Rep. Sonny Montgomery, R-Miss., congratulated      Rep. Sonny Montgomery, R-Miss., congratulated Lockheed-Martin board chairman Daniel Tellep, who was honored last week with the 1996 James Forrestal Memorial Award.     Montgomery inserted Tellep's speech in the March 14 Congressional Record.      Tellep noted his frustrations about defense, but said there was room for optimism: "Optimism that we may be on the threshold of arresting, if not reversing the protracted decline in defense budgets -- and the downsizing and force reductions."     Tellep said now, with the fiscal year 1997 budget, is the time to stop the decline in defense; reverse the trend.     To make it happen, Tellep said there are some immediate steps:     ** Make a better case to the American people on the global nature of threats, emphasizing no defense exists against ballistic missile attack.     ** Make defense an issue in the fiscal year 1997 budget cycle and the 1996 federal elections.     ** Reestablish firewalls around the defense budget so it isn't a checkbook for the rest of the federal budget.     ** Spend defense dollars more efficiently, continuing acquisition reform, improving the tooth-to-tail ratio and shedding excess depot capacity.     The awards dinner was hosted by the National Security Industrial Assn. and the American Defense Preparedness Assn.      A Rutgers University study says Los Angeles can cut defense industry losses by reorienting aerospace-related manufacturing and emphasizing employee retraining.     University economists said the LA economy is still vulnerable, but ready to move on new initiatives and partnerships among private firms, public authorities and community and labor groups.     The defense industry has been shrinking due to government cuts, leading to site shutdowns and moves.     "Los Angeles is an ideal laboratory for experimenting with many of these technologies, and the delegation should push for links between new programs and conversion adjustment efforts," the study notes.     The study says many defense companies have been able to move into other areas, taking their talent and technology with them.      The study also recommends Los Angeles expand long-term retraining opportunities for laid-off workers, pooling resources, to keep engineering and skilled workers.     The study notes nearly a third of those who have left aerospace since 1989 stopped looking for jobs, left the state or are unemployed.Back to Headline List CopyrightBMD MONITOR via NewsNetMARCH 22, 1996Requests for Proposals BMDO wants multinational technical support     BMDO plans to issue an RFP for multinational technical support.

"We would like to put more commercial equipment in place in orderto withdraw some of our tactical [communications] assets," Air ForceBrig. Gen. Buford "Randy" Witt, the U.S. European Command's directorof command, control, communications, and computer systems, told C4INEWS in a Jan. 8 telephone interview from Stuttgart, Germany. "Wewould like to replace some units before the year is up."      Equipment likely to be replaced by commercial industry includessystems that offer long-haul connectivity between variouscommunications centers and computer terminals and networks, Witt said.      NATO and Pentagon approval would then be necessary to go forwardwith the effort. Funding will also have to be identified to supportcontract awards.         The concept is driven by the fact that U.S. forces, while onlymaking up one-third of the 60,000 NATO peacekeepers, are providing thebulk of the communications apparatus in Bosnia. And Witt contends thatat some point during the course of the year-long operation, thoseassets may be required to support operations elsewhere.       "We are the only armed forces with enough equipment to do this,"he said. "Only a few nations have satellite communications equipmentand assets. The U.S. is certainly the most dominant player. We havethe most infrastructure in place from a tactical standpoint."      And much of EUCOM's communications assets have been supportingoperations in Bosnia for some time. Before the introduction of U.S.ground troops in December, the U.S.'s communications infrastructurewas supporting United Nations peacekeepers in the region and was latertailored for a possible U.S. intervention to withdraw those troopsshould they be placed in jeopardy. That infrastructure is nowsupporting U.S. and NATO troops on the ground, at sea, and in the air.      "We have tied up a huge resource with this deployment," Wittadded. "I want to replace some of our military gear so that equipmentcan be used elsewhere."      Bringing in private contractors to alleviate the communicationsburden placed on U.S. forces in Bosnia is not an entirely new idea.Some commercial firms are already playing a part in supportingOperation Joint Endeavor.       For example, the U.S. is already leasing bandwidth on thecommercial satellites of some Southeastern European countries andplans to lease more as the operation progresses. Also, EUCOM plans toaward a contract in the near future for commercial telephone servicein-theater.      "There are some [from the private sector] working for [EUCOM],but they are not huge efforts," Witt said.        Before contracts would be awarded and commercial equipmentbrought in to replace some of the military assets in Bosnia, Witt andothers must first ensure all necessary communications support is inplace.        Witt estimates that roughly 60 percent of the communicationsequipment required to support the operation is Bosnia is in theaterand up and running, most notably high-frequency satellite links. "Butwe're still deploying equipment," he said. "NATO said the totaldeployment of [60,000] troops will take 60 days. The skeleton is down,but the operating forces are just getting started. The remaining 40percent will be for units in the field."Back to Headline List CopyrightC4I NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 18, 1996U.S. WANTS DBS DEMO IN BOSNIA     U.S. commanders are anxiously awaiting the introduction of theDirect Broadcast System (DBS) into Bosnia, hoping that its ability totransmit large pieces of voice and video  communications will enhancethe C4I picture of Operation Joint Endeavor.     The Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Defense InformationSystems Agency have received Pentagon approval to pursue DBS as partof an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD), with Bosnia asa potential laboratory, according to Air Force Brig. Gen. Buford"Randy" Witt, the European Command's director of command, control,communications, and computers systems.      DBS would rely on commercial communications satellites totransmit scores of information to warfighters on the ground and atsea.      The Navy is currently pursuing such a capability--called theGlobal Broadcast System--but a DBS ACTD "offers the potential offuzing [the system] into the force more rapidly," Witt said in aninterview with C4I NEWS.      The desire for DBS "is driven by the need to better manage andmove information to people in the field, rather than headquarters,"Witt said. Its application in Bosnia "is more than promising."     Before the ACTD gets going, however, DoD must identify additionalresources, Witt added. Back to Headline List CopyrightC4I NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 18, 1996IMPROVED TARGETING COULD SAVE DOD MILLIONS, ANALYSIS SUGGESTS             By improving the ability of military forces to locate andidentify enemy targets the Defense Department could drasticallyimprove attack operations while allowing it to scale back plans forexpensive buys of precision munitions and high performance aircraft,Air Force officials have learned from a recent analysis.      A cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA) recentlycompleted for the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System(Joint STARS) has led service officials to conclude the Pentagon wouldbe wise to pursue more systems like the Northrop Grumman-developedlong-range, air-to-ground surveillance and battle management system.       By investing in such advanced sensors, operations such as bombingsorties could be significantly improved and much-needed dollars savedover the long term by leveraging more information rather than morehardware, Air Force officials believe.        ...Results May Boost C2 Investment      "The results say improve target acquisition," an Air Forceofficial said of the COEA. "In other words, if [Joint STARS] gives aquantum improvement [in lethality], it's natural to assume in othersensor areas it would be the same."      "This [analysis] might have a significant affect on command andcontrol investment in the future," the official said.      Joint STARS provides commanders with real-time information on thewhereabouts of enemy ground targets. The system is currentlycompleting its operational test and evaluation while deployed insupport of the NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia (Defense Daily,Dec. 22, 1995).       Joint STARS consists of a modified Boeing E-8 aircraft andground-based terminals and is slated for full rate production in FY'96.      The COEA results suggest that improvements in DoD's command andcontrol architecture can introduce as equal an improvement inlethality as new precision munitions and aircraft, service officialssaid.      Moreover, if Air Force fighters can destroy an enemy target withtwo "shots" instead of four, for example, some aircraft can be freedup to kill additional targets, one service official observed. In otherwords, "the current [Air Force] force structure is adequate, and wedon't have to buy more [fighters]" if the right investments are made,the official said.      "We don't need 40 fighter wings, but need to invest more in ourarchitecture."   Back to Headline List CopyrightC4I NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 18, 1996PENTAGON RESTORES MOST OF ARMY'S SINCGARS FUNDING            Late last month the Pentagon's leadership heeded the Army's criesover the past few months and agreed to restore nearly all of theservice's funding request for the Single Channel Ground and AirborneRadio System (SINCGARS) in the next two fiscal years, according to DoDofficials and budget documents.        The service is now set to accelerate fielding of an improvedversion of the primary tactical radio system and believes it canretain two prime contractors and continue to keep costs down. GeneralDynamics and ITT  compete annually for SINCGARS production and areboth working on the SINCGARS System Improvement Program (SIP).        In early December, Deputy Defense Secretary John White restoredthe $92.8 million in FY '97 money DoD Comptroller John Hamrerecommended be cut last November. However, until last week, the Armywas set to lose all of its $298 million request for FY '98.        In program budget decision (PBD) 731 on Dec. 28, White restored$267.9 million in FY '98, $30 million less than the Army was lookingfor. The decision came after continued Army assertions that the FY '98cut would put the program and force readiness in jeopardy.        Although the Army won't be able to buy as many radios in FY '98as originally intended, service officials are confident the program isout of the woods.                              "We see that as a pretty fair cut," an Army budget officialsaid of the $30 million FY '98 decrement. "We made our case and gotmost of what we asked for."         Budget requests are made for two fiscal years at once, butCongress appropriates funding for only one year at a time. This yearthe Pentagon is at a disadvantage going into its final budgetdeliberations because without a federal budget for FY '96 it lacks afunding baseline for FY '97 to work against. Without a federal budgetsoon, the FY '97 request will likely be delayed beyond the statutorydeadline for being submitted to Congress.         The comptroller's original recommendation to cut FY '97 and FY'98 SINCGARS money was based on the belief that the Army planned touse the resources to outfit the National Guard with the primarycommand and control system used by infantry, armor, artillery andaviation units. But, the argument went, the National Guard has nowarfighting mission, does not require SINCGARS, and should make dowith its older VRC-12 series radios.        But the Army, in an appeal to Hamre's recommendations inNovember, said it plans to field the SINCGARS SIP radio to first-to-fight units and that the National Guard will benefit only by receivingthose SINCGARS already fielded and set to be replaced by the SIPradios. The appeal by Neil Ginnetti, principal deputy assistantsecretary of the Army, prompted White to approve the FY '97 request inDecember. But the Army's continued fight led to White's decision lastweek to approve FY '98 funding as well.        Last fall the Army decided to accelerate the SINCGARS programin an effort to field the required 225,000 radios as quickly aspossible and save nearly $500 million over the future years defenseplan by buying out the program in three years instead of eight. TheArmy plans to apply those cost savings to other areas.        The accelerated plan calls for $283 million in FY '97, $298million in FY '98, and $15 million in FY '99 and FY '00, according tointernal Army documents.Back to Headline List CopyrightC4I NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 18, 1996TRW NABS DESKTOP TELECONFERENCING CONTRACT        TRW's  attempts at applying its commercial technologies tomilitary needs is continuing to pay off, with the company announcingits receipt of a contract award last week from the Army Communicationsand Electronics Command for a desktop video teleconferencing system(DVTS).        The five-year, $11.4 million contract will allow DoD personnelthroughout the world to conduct "face to face" meetings withoutleaving their offices, the company in a statement.        Commercial off-the-shelf equipment upgrades will be installedon existing Army computers, providing state-of-the-art performance ata significant cost savings. The system also promises to save time andmoney by reducing the need for military officials to travel to meetings.        "This contract represents the largest single commitment of anyagency to make desktop video teleconferencing an integral part of theworkplace's communications backbone, said Fred Reinhardt, TRW programmanager. "The Army's vision for this system is the scaffolding to thefuture, in terms of meeting our military's challenge to do more withless."        DVTS is a spin-off from an inventory control program TRW wasasked to do for the Air Force's B-2 bomber effort, according to acompany official.         The company official said TRW is currently negotiating with theother military services for the introduction of DVTS. One inparticular is interested in the system for its telemedicinecapabilities, he said.        TRW is teamed with AT&T on the Army contract and lower tierpartners will provide other services.        Initial installation has already begun and will continuethrough 1997, with options to extend installation another year.Maintenance support will be performed during the remaining three yearsof the contract.Back to Headline List CopyrightC4I NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 18, 1996IN BATTLE FOR SCARCE DOLLARS, C4I EMERGING AS HEAVYWEIGHT     With the Soviet threat fading into memory, a quick glance at howthe United States has changed its national security posture over thepast six years leaves little doubt that domestic concerns increasinglycommand the attention of American leaders and any attempt atjustifying the bloated defense budgets of yore would be viewed as aneffort in futility.      But from a closer look at how America goes about the business ofdefending itself these days emerges the maxim that "the more you knowthe better." And despite what threats may arise, the Clinton WhiteHouse and the Republican-led Congress appear to agree at least on onething: that U.S. military forces must be equipped with the latestadvances in communications technologies to ensure they remain relevantin international security affairs.      In fact, spending on command, control, communications, computers,and intelligence (C4I) programs is one of a few areas of the defensebudget that has remained stable over the past few years and is evenexpected to grow in real terms, defense experts tell C4I News JohnPike, a defense analyst with the Federation of American Scientists,believes overall defense spending will fall victim to the budget ax asmore and more discretionary spending is identified to balance thefederal budget.       But C4I programs "will probably be less affected in the sensethat if you look around DoD and ask yourself which programs have astory to tell and are telling it well, the answer is C4I," Pike said.In other words, "it's not that hard to make the case as to why theseprograms are important."       All the military services are involved in highly visible attemptsat folding advanced communications technology into their warfightingplans. For example there are Army's battlefield digitization effort,or Force XXI, the Navy's "Copernicus Forward" plan, and the JointStaff-sponsored "C4I for the Warrior" philosophy.      "I can't think of any program that has that type of explanationgoing on," Pike said. "There are more slogans than all other DoDprograms put together."        "All things considered, C4I programs are in reasonably goodshape" as future defense budgets are formulated, Pike said.      Besides, numerous sources have pointed out, C4I programs are notpolitically controversial as funding for the Air Force's B-2 bomberand missile defense spending.                 Steve Olson of Hughes Aircraft , who heads the ElectronicsIndustries Association's annual 10-year forecast of defense spending,believes the C4I market will remain "relatively flat" in the nearfuture, "but the government will buy more C4I stuff than it ever hasbefore."      Olson believes spending in this area may not increase in realterms in large part because the military services are relying on moreand more commercial products and systems to meet their needs, thuskeeping costs down. "They will be paying less for more," he said.      Olson contends that small, rather than big ticket items will be aPentagon focus in information systems acquisition and spending on theoperation and maintenance of such systems will also increase. Systemswhich enhance the ability of the services to communicate with eachother in joint operations will also be high on the Pentagon's prioritylist, he believes.      But despite what programs budget officials and analyst believeC4I money should be spent on, it's clear that the interests of defensecompanies lies in the investment in information technologies.      "The overall budget will fall but C4I will, in proportion, remainstable because the technology revolution necessitates maintaining thatspending level," Tom Moore, a defense analyst at the HeritageFoundation, contends. "In general, C4I spending will probably remainconstant."                              "I don't know anybody that would object to" such spending, addedformer Pentagon official and Brookings Institution analyst Larry Korb.Back to Headline List CopyrightC4I NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 18, 1996C4I DRIVES BUYOUTS, ANALYST SAYS     The recent spate of defense industry consolidations demonstratesthe widespread belief that C4I spending is on firm footing in a periodof reduced defense budgets, according to a leading market analyst.     According to James Schwendenger, of Los Angeles-based Deloitte &Touche Consulting Group, the decisions by Lockheed Martin to purchaseLoral's  defense business and Northrop Grumman's  expected buyout ofWestinghouse's  defense and electronics division were driven in partby the desire to cement a position in the C4I and defense electronicsmarkets.     Both defense giants currently have limited involvement in thesegrowth areas and "have been looking for an opportunity to acquirebusinesses to allow them to get involved," Schwendenger told C4I NEWSlast week.     Schwendenger estimates that Northrop Grumman's C4I business willincrease from roughly 10-15 percent to 30 percent if its acquisitionof Westinghouse goes forward. "It put them on the [C4I] map."     Moreover, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are currentlyheavily rooted in airframe production, the future of which isuncertain. "Will Northrop Grumman make fighters in 2020?" Schwendengerasks. "That's questionable."     But the technology boom in communications and electronics, on theother hand, has a bright future, he said.

TheClinton administration asked Congress for $130.7 million for SBIRSdevelopment in FY '96, but lawmakers appropriated $230.7 million.

On Dec. 28, the president vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, which approves funding levels and provides guidance for the Defense Dept.'s cleanup programs. Clinton cited the bill's direction to "slow the pace of [DOD's] environmental cleanup efforts" among his reasons for the rejection.     H.R. 1530 would have set a spending ceiling this fiscal year for DOD's Defense Environmental Restoration Account (DERA) at $1.422 billion -- $200 million less than Clinton requested.     Also for DERA, Congress said it expected DOD's environmental security program to reduce funding for administrative, support, studies, and investigations to 20% of total funding by FY 1997.     The bill also directed DOD to report by April 1 on progress made in reducing spending on administration and studies and on actions it plans to further reduce spending.     Clinton also vetoed the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill, Dec. 18.     That bill -- which funds EPA Superfund -- returns to conference, where it probably will gather dust until the administration and congressional Republicans can compromise on a balanced budget for the next several years.**Hundreds of contract Superfund workers sent home     Clinton cited cuts to environmental programs as one of his reasons for vetoing the $80.6 billion appropriations bill, which included $1.163 billion for Superfund, almost $400 million less than he requested.     "We cut low-priority EPA items," said Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., who chaired the conference committee. "We've done as good a job as possible under the circumstances."     The VA-HUD and Independent Agencies bill would have provided $5.7 billion for EPA in FY 1996, which began Oct. 1.     Superfund had continued relatively unscathed, due to a surplus in the trust fund. But because of the government shutdown, EPA stopped work at 609 Superfund sites -- all but those of highest priority -- on Wednesday.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPS REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996Division ProfileDownsized SWD should weather div. cut well     DALLAS -- Set up in 1937 to design and build flood-control and hydropower reservoirs, the Corps' Southwestern Div. now logs mileage daily down all the Corps' major avenues: environmental stewardship, HTRW cleanup, military construction, disaster relief, and work for other federal agencies.     Southwestern Div. covers 18% of the nation's landmass (see maps on p.3) and 28% of the land the Corps regards as its own. More than 15% of the nation's waterborne commerce plies SWD's waterways, particularly along its 426 miles of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The division operates 18 hydropower projects and 98 lakes.     The division office here provides oversight to five districts: Albuquerque, Fort Worth (CR, 11/24/95), Tulsa (CR, 2/17/95), Galveston (CR, 12/8/95), and Little Rock (CR, 2/3/95).     SWD does design and construction at 10 active Army and 14 active Air Force installations. It manages HTRW cleanup at various Air Force and Army installations and for the Dept. of Energy at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas.     The Dallas office estimates SWD's military programs are worth $961 million. In fiscal year 1995, it spent $384.8 million of the $465 million made available for its civil works.     Some careful reprogramming enabled mission execution in civil works during FY 1995 came in at greater than 100% of what Dallas scheduled.*****Southwestern Div.

Penland, who spent 10 years in military-project planning with Transatlantic Programs Center, said SWD plans to get its civil carryover down to zero by FY 1998.**Division twice escaped death sentence     The division has 219 full-time equivalencies -- 184 at the Federal Building in Dallas, 28 at the SWD lab on Cass St. in Dallas, and seven more in reservoir control. The division already downsized because of anticipated restructuring in the 1991 and 1992 plans, which were rejected by Congress, and hasn't built back up. Programs Management Director Ed Cohn doesn't anticipate any layoffs, as the Corps continues to downsize.     The 1991 restructuring plan would have closed the division office in Dallas and sent most of its districts and work to a new South Central Div. in Vicksburg, Miss., with the rest going to a new Southwest Div. in San Francisco. The 1992 plan also would have closed the Dallas office.     "The flags were supposed to go up on the new divisions in February of '93," said Paul Robinson, acting director of Engineering and Technical Services. "And that didn't happen."     At the time SWD had a military program worth more than $1 billion and a civil-works program worth more than $400 million. Combined with Lower Mississippi Valley Div.'s civil-works program of more than $1 billion, and allowing for Albuquerque Dist.'s move to the West, the new South Central Div. would have had a total program worth more than $2 billion.     Now the brass in Dallas thinks the division is safe because, unlike LMVD or North Central Div. (two primarily civil-works divisions), SWD is top heavy with no major Corps mission.      Fort Worth Dist. has about a $300 million annual military program. Galveston has a vibrant civil program.      And Tulsa Dist., which would have closed under the 1991 restructuring plan, today is robust as SWD's HTRW design district. The division's HTRW program -- just $12 million in 1990 -- jumped to nearly $110 million in FY 1995. Tulsa has two Total Environmental Restoration Contracts, which together are worth more than $500 million.  **Each district has its niche     Albuquerque Dist.'s workload has held steady because of its commitment to family housing.     "That's unique to them," said Louis Carr, SWD's acting director of Construction/Operations Div. "They were able to go out and develop the relationship with the Air Force that enabled them to become the designer for Air Force family housing."     Good thing. Albuquerque does far more work for the Air Force than for the Army.     "The selling point," said Robinson, "was the design/build approach. They streamlined that process for family housing."     Tulsa Dist. is unique for combining engineering and construction in the same division. It looks as though base closings and realignments designated in this year's round will bring $220 million of work to four sites in Tulsa Dist.     "We're waiting for the [specific assignments from] BRAC '95 to get finalized," said Aldo Brazzale, chief of Military and HTRW Programs Division in Programs Management. "And there is some BRAC '95 work in Tulsa's area, based on what is in the BRAC '95 program. We don't know yet how much of that will come to pass, but there's some work at McAlester [Army Ammunition Plant, Okla.], some work at Tinker [AFB, Okla.], for instance."     Little Rock Dist. is becoming what the Corps thinks of as a mature district. Nearly all of its civil-works appropriations go toward operating and maintaining its projects. Indeed, the Corps' civil-works side as a whole seems headed in that direction, toward merely operating its projects.     Even so, Fort Chaffee, Ark., should get about $25 million of environmental-restoration work in either fiscal year 1996 or 1997. *****Installations within SWD named in 1995 BRACRealignment     ClosureKirtland AFB, N.M.

The Spokane, Wash., company beat out Humphrey Construction, Woodinville, Wash., which bid $16.85 million; Harcon Inc., also of Spokane, which bid $17.85 million; Haskell Construction, Bellingham, Wash., $19.2 million; and Abhe and Svoboda Inc., Prior Lake, Minn., which bid $24.46 million.     The government estimated the job, which is part of the Corps' Columbia River Fish Mitigation Program, at $17.04 million.     PK went right to work, starting construction late last month on the elevated, three-part, fish-passage system that will extend more than 2,400 feet. The apparatus will include adult holding and sampling areas and expand juvenile-fish monitoring capabilities at John Day. It should be ready by summer of 1997.     Once the facility comes on line, biologists from the Corps, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and other fishery agencies will monitor and sample the fish, and analyze the data on-site. Biologists will tag the fish and release them back into the Columbia, downstream of the powerhouse.     The Corps will operate the facility.     Biologists will do a variety of research "relevant to all migrating species" at John Day, said Portland Dist. Spokeswoman Dawn Edwards.      "Radio-tracking and hydro-acoustics will tell us where the fish are approaching the project," added Project Manager Stuart Stanger.     Biologists will use the survival data to assist in-season and long-term management of the river system.      The fish-passage system will have a 1,200-foot-long, five-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep chute extending along the Oregon shoreline from the powerhouse to a dewatering building, which will be 100 feet long by 40 feet wide.     A funnel effect will direct the juveniles to the dewatering building. From there, they will travel about 1,200 feet through a transport flume to the sampling and monitoring building. A computerized monitoring system then will determine survival rates and travel times by analyzing passive-integrated-transponder (PIT) tags placed in the fish at various hatchery and upriver capture locations.

Division Program Manager Debby Chenoweth and Environmental Engineer Bob Hahn discussed ways to work with the Corps at a Mine Drainage Workshop here sponsored by the Terrene Institute. The workshop drew nearly 150 people: federal officials from the Corps, EPA, the Office of Surface Mining, and the Dept. of Agriculture; state officials; activists looking for ways to restore streams; and mining-company representatives.     Chenoweth said the Corps could help environmental groups, states, and other federal agencies. However, she discouraged the idea that the Corps had limitless resources. West Virginia Dept. of Environmental Protection Director Eli McCoy had earlier described the Corps as the "Daddy Warbucks" of government agencies.     Because the areas in the eastern United States contaminated by acid-mine drainage "almost exactly parallel Ohio River Div.'s boundaries," Chenoweth noted, ORD districts -- Pittsburgh, Huntington, Louisville, and Nashville -- might be further along than others with these programs.     Many workshop speakers mentioned the Corps as a source of funding for combating acid-mine drainage. Office of Surface Mining Director Robert Uram said states could match their "abandoned mine lands" funds, which are used to reclaim old mine sites, with Corps funds. An official in charge of coordinating USDA's natural resources conservation service suggested tapping Corps funding because acid-mine drainage affects water-resource management.      Hahn outlined four Corps programs, which could be used.     * Authorized Corps projects have two key advantages: the Corps supplies half the funding and manages the program from design through operation. However, with these projects customers must lobby their congressional leaders as they have to survive the congressional budget battles.     * The Support for Others program requires less time and money, Hahn said, plus the customer can set a project's scope. However, the Corps provides no money and only limited manpower for such projects.     * If a customer wants a lot of Corps funding, Hahn added, it could show the quality of its watershed affects a Corps project as outlined in the Section 1135 environmental-restoration program. Restoration jobs have difficulty fitting the strict limitations of scope and location, but if the job falls into this category it can receive 75% of its money from the Corps.     * Finally, the Corps will provide half of the money states need for watershed-restoration planning. However, this planning assistance program has a limited budget and will not pay for the actual work of putting concrete in the ground or establishing wetlands.     "We don't have any specific amount of money set aside," Chenoweth said, but interested states and organizations need to get in line as soon as possible to get Corps feasibility studies started for their projects. Feasibility studies generally take about a year.     Hahn reminded the workshop that the Corps also provides technical assistance -- on regulations, federal and state programs, geology, hydrology, meteorology, and consultation -- at no cost. He urged people to contact a Corps office.     "We're eager to help," Hahn said.     As examples of projects using Corps funds and technical assistance, Chenoweth mentioned two in Ohio: a $400,000 project at Wills Creek, where fly ash will be used to treat acid-mine drainage, and a $4 million project at Piedmont Lake.**Problem requires long trip to recovery     Acid-mine drainage contributes to water pollution where old underground and surface coal mines were abandoned before federal regulations required mine operators to reclaim the properties.     Many streams in Appalachian coal fields suffer from acid-mine drainage. When sulphur-bearing rock meets oxygen, it can create an acid that is carried into nearby streams by surface runoff or groundwater. The acid leaches heavy metals from the earth and lowers the pH of the streams.     Correcting the problem requires expensive techniques. Physical measures include filling an underground mine with fly ash, building concrete dikes to contain groundwater, and establishing wetlands to serve as a natural filter. Restoration projects also use chemical measures, such as  administering alkaline materials to a stream through "doser" silos or piles dumped along its banks to bring the water up to a neutral pH level.     For more information on the ORD acid-mine drainage programs call Chenoweth at 513-684-6038 or Hahn at -6201.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPS REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996Small contract opportunities     Baltimore Dist. needs elevator maintenance at Fort Myer, Va., for $250,000-$500,000.

"We saved the taxpayers over $5 billion a year for the next four years, and we did it for under $13 million," said Charles Smith, the last executive director of BRAC.     Former BRAC Chairman Alan Dixon, who presided over the fourth round of BRAC last year, sometimes found himself confronted by parents holding the children they said would starve if bases near their homes closed.     Because the 20% of domestic bases closing down still leaves slack in the military infrastructure, Dixon's commission recommended a fifth round of BRAC -- but not until 2001.     Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who helped write the legislation creating the commission, said shrinking Defense budgets could mean pressure to close more bases will come sooner, and from the military services: "They don't enjoy it, either. But when it's either that or not modernize, it makes a difference."     Before Congress's Office of Technology Assessment closed in September, it observed that base closures usually occur in areas that can absorb the job loss and usually make available valuable real estate.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPS REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996Lancaster confirmation delayed     Martin Lancaster's confirmation as the new assistant secretary of the Army (Civil Works) likely will have to wait until resolution of the budget stalemate, the nominee said just before Christmas.

It finalized the conference agreement to give the Pentagon Renovation $108.02 million for FY 1996 (CR, 9/29/95) and to consolidate renovation funding in the "Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide" account.     It funded the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, which gives a lot of work to Transatlantic Programs Center, at $300 million for FY 1996 -- $71 million below the president's request. CTR aims to reduce the nuclear threat in the former Soviet Union, in part through incentives such as building housing for retired military officers.

The President tentativelyapproved an FY '91 DoD budget outlay figure of $292.15 billionlast week.  The FY '91 (050) (DoD and Department of Energy)outlays are around $301 billion, while the budget authority isaround $307 billion.

He said that in FY '91,16,000 military and civilian personnel and 42,000 personnelthrough FY '95 will be trimmed from the logistics and managementwork force of 580,000.  Cheney said these cut backs wereefficiency-related cutbacks and not a part of force structureincluded in the FY '91 budget.Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood said most of thepersonnel cutbacks will be absorbed through the DoD's normalattrition rate, which he said is much higher than the total to betrimmed.Atwood said the Pentagon is implementing major cultural changesin the way DoD is run and the way its purchasing system works.The Administration's legislative policy will be developed by thePentagon and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The DMR was issued in July 1989 after President Bush directedCheney to devise and implement the recommendations of the PackardCommission to improve defense acquisition, and better manage DoD.A legislative task force under the direction of the legislativecounsel and former Secretary of the Army, Jack Marsh, reviewedexisting statutes and recommended changes that improve DoDefficiency. The task force recommended that following areas beimproved: production, acquisition and logistics; military andcivilian personnel; environment; and department finances.    The report also calls for the overhaul of the "statutoryframework for DoD acquisition."  Strengthening of the defenseindustrial base, improved observance of ethical standards ingovernment and industry, and improving defense management wereoutlined by Atwood as essential to the successful "culturalchanges" necessary for the success of the management overhaul.To strengthen the industrial base, Under Secretary of Defense(Acquisition) John Betti said during an informal meeting with thepress, that the Pentagon must create incentives and eliminate"disincentives" for industry to invest in new facilities andequipment as well as research and development.  Betti said theprocess should be made easier for industry and the DoD.Atwood outlined the following points that would improve defensemanagement:  *  Reducing overhead while maintaining military strength;  *  enhancing weapon systems program performance;  *  reinvigorating the planning and budget process;  *  reducing micromanagement;  *  strengthening the defense industrial base;  *  and improving observance of ethical standards in government        and industry.Betti told reporters that one way to tighten the acquisitionprocess is to keep disciplined milestones.  He said many problemshave occurred as a result of concurrency.  Under the newstreamlined system programs with problems would not be allowed toproceed, or in essence postponed, until the problems are clearedup.

Ragsdale said hehas heard nothing of the Navy terminating the P-7 program.Lockheed won the contract for the P-7 as a follow-on to the P-3ASW aircraft. It said that the basic body of the aircraft wouldbe the same, according to sources. Ragsdale said that followingspecific tests during the full-scale engineering developmentstage "We found it wasn't as possible to have commonality betweenparts."

This summer, the two 707 test aircraft will be turnedover to the Air Force and Army for operational test andevaluation, which may last as long as 12 months.  An early 1991contract award is anticipated; the Air Force plans to procure 22JSTARS aircraft at a cost of $6.6 billion (including R&D);another $1.1 billion will be spent for construction of 100 groundstations.  JSTARS is slated for a 1997 deployment.Although the primary focus of JSTARS has been and remains themonitoring rear of echelon Warsaw Pact forces on the CentralEuropean battlefield, "the Air Force and we see its efficacy as awarning and verification instrument as we proceed to Open Skiesagreements and things of that sort," the officials said.Grumman is also looking at the use of JSTARS in specialoperations, low intensity conflict (SOLIC) scenarios and drugintervention, officials said.  Senior Army TRADOC officials werebriefed on these areas late last month and showed interest,although they said a great deal of analysis would have to be doneon the service's future roles prior to committing to JSTARS,Grumman noted.  In addition, representatives of Central Commandrecently made presentations at an industry forum which detailedthe potential application of JSTARS technology for supportingSOLIC.  "I think what we are seeing is that the services arelooking at additional applications of systems, due to budgetaryconstraints and the changing threat, which they did not look atbefore," one Grumman official said.                       * * * * * * * * * *Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE INDUSTRY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1990AIR FORCE PICKS NEW ECM TRAINING EQUIPMENT   The Air Force has awarded a $15 million contract to AELDefense Corp.

This mission will also be the firstcommercial launch of McDac's Delta II.The experiments are the Low-Power Atmospheric CompensationExperiment (LACE), the Ultraviolet Plume Instrument (UVPI), theArmy Background Experiment (ABE) and the Relay Mirror Experiment(RME).  Two of the experiments, LACE and UVPI were developed atthe Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) LACE will be the 79th NRLsatellite to be launched.The LACE experiment consists chiefly of the 1400 kg LACEsatellite and several ground stations that will be used todetermine how well the atmospheric distortion of laser beams canbe corrected.  The propagation of laser beams through theatmosphere and the principle of thermal blooming is one of themost difficult challenges facing directed energy weaponsresearch.  By being a target for lasers, LACE will measure thework on the problem.The satellite contains more than 200 sensors that are able tomeasure laser beam intensity.  There are three different sensorarrays to measure different types of laser emission.  They arevisible band control wave (85 sensors), infrared continuous wave(40 sensors) and pulsed lasers that emit in the near UV, visibleand shortwave IR (85 sensors).  The LACE target array is fourmeters by four meters.The satellite will be placed in an orbit 295 nautical miles abovethe Earth and, since it will pass over the Air Force Maui OpticalStation (AMOS) at least once every 24 hours, it will allow forlaser experiments to be conducted daily.                       * * * * * * * * * *Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE INDUSTRY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1990HEDI EXPECTED TO LAUNCH BEFORE END OF MONTH        The Strategic Defense Initiative's High EndoatmosphericDefense Interceptor (HEDI) is expected to have its first flighttest before the end of January, sources tell Defense IndustryReport.                       * * * * * * * * * *Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE INDUSTRY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1990     *LEP KE PROJECTILE.

In their review, the board rejected a Navy request totransfer the ASAT program from Army's Strategic Defense Commandto the Navy's Strategic Systems Program Office.     The Army is interested in developing a land-based ASAT thatcould eventually be upgraded to sea duty. But the Navy wanted tofocus exclusively on the sea-based system, a move that manysuspect weighted the DAB review in the Army's favor.     A request for proposals is expected sometime in January,although a specific date has not been established. Judging by thereturns, the Army will borrow from technology based upon theexoatmospheric re-entry interceptor system being developed underthe auspices of the Strategic Defense Initiative.

With aoperating arc of more than 60 degrees, ROTHR can detect targetsat a range of up to 1,800 miles. OTH radars operate by bouncingradio waves off the Earth's ionosphere which bounces the wavesback to Earth.

NEWS ANALYSIS     In a series of interviews conducted during the previous twoweeks, C3I Report has learned most contractors aresteering clear of window ledges and are focusing instead on areasof growth, belt-tightening and resource consolidation.     For example, TRW's Joseph Aro says the Information NetworkDiv. for which he works has four telemarketers making 1,200outbound calls a week in an attempt to solicit new customers forhis company's products.     A source with Lockheed Corp. suggests the company's decisionto integrate two of its subsidiaries -- Lockheed Electronics Co.(LEC) with Sanders Associates -- is an indication that thecompany is actively seeking the means to trim the fat and "dowhat we do best." Lockheed laid off 1,000 of LEC's employees andmoved its operations into Sanders' Nashua, N.H. complex.     Chrysler Corp. has placed its defense electronics operationson the block in order to focus exclusively on the competitiveautomobile market.     Northrop Corp. announced plans to sell its spaciousheadquarters building in Century City, Los Angeles. "In order toreduce our debt, we're actively looking at the sale of our non-operating assets," says Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio.     The prime contractor for the B-2 is not the only militaryaircraft maker to suddenly enter the real estate market. Inearly December F-14 producer Grumman Corp. announced plans toredevelop half its 500-acre Long Island property into a hotel,shopping mall and office complexes.     In each of these instances, company officers evaluated theirspecific strengths and weaknesses and acted.     "You've got to be proactive in the current environment,"says TRW's Aro. "There are a lot of companies that are sittingout there wringing their hands. That's not our approach."Creating a market     As marketing manager for TRW's networks division, Arofocuses almost exclusively on the Unified Local Area NetworkArchitecture or ULANA contract, an Air Force system designed tolink military computers with one another. Aro is convinced hisoffice's aggressive telemarketing efforts are paying off. He saidmarket conditions for TRW's ULANA products is stronger than thatof Electronic Data Systems, the other prime contractor for ULANA.     There is a lesson in all this, says Aro. "The more skittish[contractors] believe anybody can lose their job. They think theymight be driving a truck soon.     "Others," says Aro, "are charging ahead to get the jobdone."Back to Headline List CopyrightC3I REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990FAA-DOD controversy threatens GPS     Just when you thought it was safe to go back out on thewater, the system that promises to get you to your destinationand back is again embroiled in bitter controversy.     A number of aviation groups have complained to DefenseSecretary Richard Cheney and Transportation Secretary SamuelSkinner that the Defense Dept. is blocking civil use of thePentagon's much-heralded Global Positioning System (GPS).     GPS is a constellation of two dozen satellites, some ofwhich are already in orbit, intended to provide extremelyaccurate navigation information to aircraft, ships, vehicles andground forces around the world.     The Soviet Union has a similar system called GLONASS. TheFederal Aviation Administration hopes a single receiver can bebuilt to receive both GPS and GLONASS signals. If satellites areto become the sole means of navigation, then neither the U.S. norSoviet system has enough satellites to provide the requiredaccuracy. But together they can do it.     A letter sent to Skinner and Cheney Dec. 13 warns thatunnamed organizations within DOD may now be seeking to subvertthat goal. The unnamed organizations are accused of renewing theissue of whether GPS data ought to be available to the civilcommunity, and issuing concerns about technology transfer.     The on-again off-again GPS controversy is indicative of manysuch instances when military and civilian protocols clash. In onecorner stands the Pentagon, ever-wary of the Soviet Union and anytechnology transfers that might make their job more difficult. Inthe other stands the FAA and related groups interested inimproving civilian navigation. Most years such a clash would haveresulted in a Pentagon victory. But recent developments and thepervading atmosphere of glasnost may result in a darkhorsevictory.Increased accuracy for DOD users     Original plans were to offer a degraded, less accurate levelof GPS navigation for the civil community, while DOD userswould get the more accurate signals. Thus, an enemy couldnavigate accurately enough for civil transportation, but couldnot use GPS data to guide weapons.     The current controversy over GPS access stems from an FAAinitiative to coordinate U.S. and Soviet tests of a jointGPS/GLONASS receiver. FAA officials say the satellite navigationprogram follows the terms of a bilateral transportationcooperation agreement signed at the 1988 Moscow summit.     The test program was proposed last spring in a joint U.S.-Soviet working paper presented in Paris at the InternationalCivil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) future air navigation systemcommittee.  An agency of the United Nations, ICAO would use testresults to certify a GPS/GLONASS system as a reliable means ofnavigation for international air travel.     The U.S. and Soviet navigation systems could be augmentedand would form the foundation for a global navigation satellitesystem (GNSS). This global system also could employgeosynchronous calibration transmitters launched by othernations.     The multi-national GNSS would be less dependent on the whimsof either superpower. A U.S. aviation expert says this redundancyis especially important for non-aligned countries who don't wanta navigation system that relies on the whims of a singlesuperpower.     Under the plan proposed to ICAO, the U.S. and USSRseparately would build and test civil GPS/GLONASS receivers. FAAofficials say the programs would be done in parallel. Sincesales of civil GPS receivers are permitted under existing exportcontrol regulations, FAA officials say there wouldn't be any needto transfer hardware or technology. "We've had no difficultywith the [DOD] tech transfer folks," one said.     To aid the U.S. test program, FAA would like the Soviets toprovide a civil GLONASS receiver for study. This shouldn't be toodifficult, since Glavkosmos, the Soviet space marketing agency,has already printed glossy brochures for its "Shkiper" receiver.     The U.S. dual receiver would be built by M.I.T. LincolnLaboratories. The system, which could be modeled on one alreadytested by Magnavox, would use orbital elements and time messagestransmitted by GPS and GLONASS satellites to calculate theposition and velocity of an aircraft.     FAA officials say the two sides would only collaborate atthe end of the test program, sharing results of their navigationtests. If each side's dual receiver is sufficiently accurate, thetwo superpowers could propose ICAO adoption of GNSS.Divergent views emerge -- again     Although GPS and GLONASS travel in similar, semisynchronousorbits, the two systems are not identical. A total of 21 primaryGPS and three spare satellites orbit in six planes, while 24GLONASS spacecraft occupy three planes. The constellations alsouse different formats to transmit position and time information.     Several FAA officials have indicated they have no intentionof promoting a merger of GPS and GLONASS technology."`Commonality' is a trigger word that sets off alarms in thePentagon," one said. FAA officials say they won't sign anyagreement that would require DOD to change the way it operatesGPS satellites or its military receivers.     Until recently, FAA's civil navigation initiative didn'tface any DOD opposition. An agency official said the GNSS jointworking paper was cleared with the Pentagon's C3I office.     But FAA plans to proceed with the bilateral test programwere stalled when DOD's space operations policy office raisedobjections to the effort. This opposition prevented FAA fromstarting detailed discussions with their Soviet counterparts lastfall.     The FAA is hoping to get back on track once the dust clearsfrom the DOD infighting. One FAA official says the problem maystem from the space policy office's unfamiliarity with civilaviation.     Said one exasperated FAA official, "We are looking forwardto the day when we can work directly with [DOD's] C3I officeagain. There's a real misunderstanding of what we're trying todo [with space ops]."     FAA's frustration is compounded by DOD's vagueness overoperating policies for GPS. In addition to encrypting the morehighly accurate navigation data for DOD users and providingcivilians with the less reliable data, DOD also reserves theright to scramble GPS's second channel to frustrate enemyattempts to spoof military receivers. While civil users couldstill navigate with one channel, it would further degradenavigational accuracy.     The opening paragraph of the letter to Cheney and Skinnerstates: "In 1983 President Reagan made the momentous decision tomake the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite navigationsystem, developed by the U.S. Defense Department, available tothe world and to offer an accuracy of navigation which would notcompromise U.S. defense needs."     Pentagon space ops officials, however, offer a differentinterpretation, arguing that the "momentous decision" actuallyalluded to a remark made by Reagan spokesman Larry Speakes at apress conference.     "If the Soviets are going to use our data for militarypurposes, we are stupid. And if they are going to use it tocompete against us in the commercial market, we are stillstupid," a Pentagon officer said.     He further accused the FAA of violating a written agreementwith the Pentagon barring even the discussion of sensitivetechnology in the GPS system, let alone suggesting thepossibility of sharing it with the Soviets.     "They agreed not to approach that topic, and have abandonedit," he said.Is GPS a navigational Everyman?     The letter was sent to Cheney and Skinner by former FAAchiefs Donald Engen, Najeeb Halaby, and Lynn Helms. It is alsosigned by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the AirLine Pilots Association, the Airport Operators CouncilInternational, the Air Transport Association, and the NationalBusiness Aircraft Association. It was sent to the media by theAirport Operators Council International. Questions to that groupwere referred to the FAA.     Another bone of contention within the Pentagon is whethergeoid data should be shared with the Soviets. Geoidal datadescribes the absolute shape of world in computer language wherethe potential for gravity is considered a constant at any point.This is the manner in which satellites view the Earth. Manybelieve the United States boasts a much more accurate geoidal mapof the world and are reluctant to share this information with theSoviets. (C3I Report 9/18/89).     The DOD official said the root issue is whether GPS willserve as the only navigational system for both military andcivilian users. The military, he noted, won't stand for it. TheFAA is seen at the Pentagon as wanting GPS to replace everythingelse: VOR navigation (which makes up the current airway system),NDB navigation (used in the middle of the century) and LORAN Cnavigation.     There is also mistrust over whether the FAA would simplyhand actual components to the Soviets, rather than data theSoviets could use to develop their own components for GPSreceivers. The United States has built a GLONASS receiver usingSoviet data.     Civil aviation experts point to the voluntary submission ofGLONASS information to the U.S. as a testament to the Soviet'scommitment to a joint program. This reversal, which occurred inearly 1988, followed years of Soviet stonewalling on discussingany details of its system.     If DOD blocks civil use of GPS, it will be a blow to workalready in progress for use of the system on airplanes and ships.Officials of the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics saidthey were informed of the controversy by AOCI, but will continuetheir work. RTCA is a federal advisory group charged with settingtechnical standards for receivers that can use both the U.S. andSoviet satellite navigation systems. Work is already completed onsystems standards for GPS use by the civil sector.     Work is also in progress on operations performance standardsfor aircraft systems, and should be completed by the end of 1990.There is also work in progress on integrating the Soviet systemwith GPS, enabling aircraft to navigate solely with GPS, GLONASSor both.     If the Pentagon can be convinced to allow civil use of GPSfor aircraft, separation standards could be reduced safely,allowing more aircraft to use trans-Atlantic routes at one time.     An RTCA official said a receiver for the Soviet system hasbeen built under an FAA contract to Mitre, Bedford, Mass.     And the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime has a groupformed to advise the federal government on standards for GPSsystems aboard ships.TAKE OUT QUOTE: "We are looking forward to the day when we canwork directly with [DOD's] C3I office again.

Located in Air Force Space Command's Consolidated SpaceOperations Center (CSOC), the Milstar control room is now in thefinal stages of installation at Falcon AFB, Colo.     Formally known as Mission Control Center 3, the Milstarcontrol room will be able to handle an operational constellationof 10 extremely high frequency communications satellites. Duringa crisis or war, the Falcon center could control satellitesthrough fixed and mobile ground stations.     Although MCC-3's IBM 3090 computers are nearly hooked up andready to run, the control center won't do much satellitecontrolling for the next two or three years. A continuing seriesof technical problems and funding cuts will delay the launch ofthe first Milstar satellite until at least 1992.     Until the first Milstar flies, SSD plans to use the centerfor software development and training. This debugging period willbe an unaccustomed luxury for SSD, which is three years behindschedule on three other Falcon control centers.     SSD plans to turn over its first CSOC center to SpaceCommand this month. The MCC-1A center controls Navstarnavigational satellites. MCC-1B, which controls meteorologicaland missile warning satellites, will be turned over in January.An MCC-2 control room for four communications satellite systemswill be operational late next year.Back to Headline List WT03-B30-24IA059-000323-B005-305http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/de27.html 205.156.212.5 19970114211636 text/html 46259HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:14:47 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:18 GMTContent-length: 46072Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/de27.html Sample Issue Copyright DEFENSE CLEANUP via NewsNet JANUARY 19, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Cash-strapped Navy seeking softer deals (413 words) Corps to incinerate Weldon Springs soil (533 words) Tooele locals press for emergency equipment (421 words) Group blasts Army over depleted uranium (483 words) Hanford solicitation modified (537 words) DRMS offers cheap way to dispose of waste (446 words) Remedial action contracts capacity remains (597 words) Rust wins Hanford work (92 words) Alaska forts seek lab (72 words) Soil cleanup offered (151 words) Battelle awards work (67 words) General Atomics to buy MODAR (63 words) Navy needs documentation (71 words) N.Y.

However, the Navy is discovering it's too late to back out of agreements already made.     In a recent guidance for active-base cleanups, the Navy's assistant secretary for installations and environment said, "enforceable milestones in negotiated legal agreements must fit within budget and FYDP [five-year defense plan] controls."     The assistant secretary, Robert Pirie, added all new agreements must provide for "'rolling milestones' established in the light of relative risk and budget considerations." Under this approach cleanup deadlines only will become enforceable in the year Congress funds the cleanup work.     Pirie also urged the Navy to revisit existing legal agreements with environmental regulators. The agreements should be, "if legally possible, amended to reflect funding controls and risk management factors."     However, the Navy will have to buck environmental regulators to avoid busting its budget plan, contended a briefing at a recent Navy environmental meeting.     The plan calls for the Navy to spend $1.5 billion over the next five years, with 53% going to the Naval Facilities Engineering Command's West Coast organizations, 28% to NAVFAC's Atlantic Div., 12% to the Southern Div. and 7% to the Pacific Div.     Last year NAVFAC field divisions arranged meetings with eight Environmental Protection Agency regions, 14 states and Guam. In the meetings, the NAVFAC officials sought to reach a consensus on renegotiating cleanup agreements so the Navy can win regulatory approval without overspending.     But the regulators declined to renegotiate, saying the Navy must start asking Congress for all the money it needs to protect human health and the environment. Typically, the Defense Dept.'s comptroller cuts service cleanup requests before they get to Congress.     On the East Coast, EPA officials stressed the need for the Navy to tell Congress how much it really needs. They also questioned why so much of the spending is planned for the West Coast.     On the West Coast, EPA officials flatly declined to negotiate extensions, and said the plan lacked enough money even for the priority projects.     California and Washington refused to renegotiate. So did Florida, though other southern states said they might be willing to talk about it.     "There will be ramifications" if the Navy adheres to its spending plan without renegotiating agreements, the briefing stated. The Navy is likely to attract heavy enforcement activity, including stipulated penalties, hazardous-waste orders, fines and penalties, lawsuits against the commanding officers of installations and citizen suits against the Navy and the environmental regulators.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE CLEANUP via NewsNetJANUARY 19, 1996Corps to incinerate Weldon Springs soil     The head of the Environmental Protection Agency has allowed an Army incineration job in Missouri to proceed by freeing it from tough state permitting requirements.     The Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City Dist. is closer to burning explosives-laced soil at the Army's Weldon Springs Ordnance Works, Mo., now that EPA Administrator Carol Browner has overruled state environmental regulators.     The corps proposed to excavate approximately 30,000 cubic yards of TNT and DNT contaminated soil and materials for incineration in a mobile on-site rotary kiln incinerator at a cost of $22 million to $27 million.     Before the design contractor, IT Corp. of Irvine, Calif., could finish the 95% design phase of the Weldon Springs cleanup project, the Missouri Dept. of Natural Resources demanded the corps get a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) permit. The corps wanted to proceed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which doesn't require permits.     Browner, who is the final arbiter of disputes among parties to the site's cleanup agreement, ruled that CERCLA should trump RCRA because the treatment will take place on a listed Superfund site. In such cases, the Superfund law requires projects to meet the substantive requirements of permits without actually getting the permits.     The Weldon Springs Ordnance Works is divided into two main sites -- the ordnance works and the chemical plant area used by the Energy Dept. during the Cold War. DOE will cleanup its area separately.     The Army is left to cleanup an area of soil contaminated with TNT and DNT covering more than 100 isolated locations. There is also a 16 mile-long contaminated wooden pipeline to be excavated and cleaned up.     Under the corps' proposed plan, the Army will excavate and incinerate contaminated soil. The resulting ash, after sampling and testing, will be backfilled on site.     Ash with high lead levels and soils contaminated with lead will be stabilized and placed in a hazardous waste landfill.     Through an agreement between the Army and DOE, the Army will dispose of its waste in a DOE planned landfill which is expected to be built in 1998. In the meantime, the Army waste will be stored on-site.     Although it would be easier to build the incinerator near the entrance to the ordnance works property, the Army, after receiving comments on its proposal, agreed to site the incinerator in a remote area away from residences and schools.     The Army expects that the incinerator will be dismantled and removed as soon as the contaminated soil and wooden pipeline have been treated, the plan said.     The corps is waiting to retrieve the money for the cleanup project from a general fund in its Formerly Used Defense Sites program before issuing a solicitation for the incinerator and soil excavation project.      Work at the site will include excavation, demolition, upgrading infrastructure and wood shredding.     Tom Lorenz, the EPA project manager for the site, said a final decision to clean up the site will be signed in the next few months. After that, the corps has 15 months to begin remediation.     For more information, call Tom Lorenz of the EPA at 913-551-7292; Steve Iverson, project manager with the corps at 816-426-2671; or Chris Davidson with the state at 314-751-3176.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE CLEANUP via NewsNetJANUARY 19, 1996Tooele locals press for emergency equipment     Local officials are trying to prevent startup of the chemical weapons incinerator at Tooele Army Depot in Utah until they get enough money to deal with any accidental release of chemical agents.     All three county commissioners and the heads of other agencies are asking the state to hold off on permitting trial burns to force the Army to come up with at least another $5 million to complete their emergency response preparations.     Officials say funding so far has been piecemeal, leaving the county with only a third of a communications system and no equipped and trained response team.     "Our concern is that they're going to start incinerating weapons before we are ready," explains Tooele County Commissioner Lois McArthur.     But the state solid and hazardous waste division says the trial burns are allowed under the original permit issued in 1989, even though the Army still needs to submit modifications for division approval. The division considers emergency response a political issue outside its realm.     Raymond Duda, a division staff engineer, says he can't understand why it's so important to have the emergency equipment now when the county has been living with the chemical arms for years. The depot has 42% of the nation's chemical weapons stockpile, much of it in 80-year-old containers that are getting leaky.     County officials say national policy requires the community to be prepared and that the Army has not come forth to pay for it.     "As I understand it, the county has an obligation to be prepared for anything that comes off base," says Commissioner McArthur. "If it's on base, the Army takes care of it."     According to Kari Sagers, county emergency management director, the Army has provided about $8 million since 1989, "a little bit at a time." In 1993, she says, the Army proposed spreading funding for the communications system over three years because of a tight budget, but the county got only the first year.     "Now we have only a third of a communications system with sites but no generators," says Sagers.  "If we need to use a station we have to send somebody up with a portable unit."     She estimates that between $5 million and $8 million is needed just for the rest of the critical items.     Tooele County in western Utah is a sparsely populated area with about 18,000 residents in the town of Tooele 10 miles from the incinerator site and about 8,000 in Grantsville 20 miles away. Another 800 live in Rush Valley which is only a few miles from the site.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE CLEANUP via NewsNetJANUARY 19, 1996Group blasts Army over depleted uranium     An environmental group this week urged the Army to stop using depleted uranium bullets and armor, and clean up what it has used, citing the Army's own environment, safety and health study.     The Military Toxics Project based in Norway, Maine, obtained a copy of the study, a technical report by the Army Environmental Policy Institute in Atlanta, even though it said the Army refused to release it.     The study analyzed the potential dangers of depleted uranium in the production, testing and fielding of weapon systems, focusing on the Operation Desert Storm battlefield.     Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the nuclear weapons program's efforts to extract the fissile isotope U-235 from uranium ore for use in weapons.      The Army uses depleted uranium for tank destroying bullets because it's plentiful, it's twice as dense as lead, it catches fire when it hits, and it tends to fragment and ricochet or turn to dust after entering enemy tanks.     The depleted uranium produces 0.4 microCuries/gram of radiation, about 60% of the 0.7 uC/g that emanates from uranium ore. Inhaled, it can lodge in the lungs, where its alpha radiation can slowly cause damage. Ingested, it concentrates in the kidneys, where it is toxic at low concentrations, as well as in the liver and bones.     Uranium oxides are very water soluble and mobile in soil, although anaerobic conditions or decayed plant matter can stall them. Soil cleanup standards are 35 picoCuries/gram  averaged over 100 square meters, and 100 pCi/gram per square meter.     The Army reported some remediation of depleted uranium bullets at domestic firing ranges. However, typically only half of the rounds fired are recovered at Yuma Proving Grounds, Ariz., and just 21% at more densely vegetated Jefferson Proving Grounds, Ind., and Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Md.     Generally, the bullets, contaminated soil and other materials are handled as low-level radioactive waste and sent to Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensed sites for disposal.     The report said the Army faces no requirement to remove the estimated 14,000 rounds of depleted uranium that litter Operation Desert Shield practice ranges in Saudi Arabia and the Desert Storm battlefield. "Remediation of battlefields is not historically the responsibility of the victor," the report said. "This task typically belongs to the indigenous population." Even so, the United States and its allies spent hundreds of millions of dollars removing unexploded ordnance and mines from the Desert Storm battlefield.     The report appraised several cleanup technologies. It also urged the Army to pursue plans to recycle used depleted uranium bullets and related waste, as well as to promote the use of catch boxes on firing ranges. It also urged the Army to provide more funding for depleted uranium waste disposal. And it suggested the Army prepare a programmatic "life-cycle environmental document" or environmental impact statement to serve as an umbrella environmental planning document.     The study's lead author was Stephen Shelton, a civil engineering professor with the University of New Mexico.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE CLEANUP via NewsNetJANUARY 19, 1996Hanford solicitation modified     The Energy Dept.'s Richland (Wash.) Operations Office has modified its request for proposals for the Project Hanford Management Contract based on some 2,000 comments to last year's draft RFP.     The department took extra steps, it said, to make sure all offerors "have an equal opportunity to be selected even if they have no past DOE experience." For example, the technical and management criteria stress that it doesn't matter whether the contractor has worked at Hanford or any DOE site.     DOE said it added a section on outcomes and success criteria after several commenters asked what DOE wants that's different from the "old way" of doing business.     DOE said the statement of work was strengthened to define the site cleanup effort as a project, just as "in commercial project management." Other changes include more detail on the tank waste cleanup, on the relationships with other prime contractors, and on the transition period work scope.     DOE reduced the infrastructure scope of work and recommended bidding it out on a fixed or fixed-unit price basis.     The final RFP emphasizes cost reduction, including aggressive make-or-buy analysis.     DOE plans to "privatize" treatment of high-level tank waste by paying a fee for treatment service to a contractor that raises its own capital to build the treatment facilities. However, the department is reserving the right, if it decides against privatizing, to ask the Hanford management contractor to handle the job instead.Contractor roles detailed     The Project Hanford Management Contractor is to assume its full duties by Oct. 1, 1996 -- six months before the March 31, 1997, expiration of the recently extended contract with incumbent Westinghouse Hanford Co.     DOE said it plans to terminate the Westinghouse contract early, as well as direct Westinghouse to terminate its subcontracts with ICF Kaiser and Boeing Computer Services.     Bechtel's cleanup contract will remain separate. It runs through 1999, with an option for three more years.     DOE said MACTEC, its general support service contractor for the site, might face a conflict of interest if it's on a team that wins the contract.     Every year, starting this Dec. 1, the contractor is to give DOE an "Advanced Acquisition Plan" that details the next two years of subcontracting plans.     To keep major subcontracts on their toes, they are limited to two years with three option years.     The standard industrial classification code is 8744, facilities support management services, with a small business size standard of $5 million average annual revenues or 500 employees.Written proposals stressed     Richland decided against the strictly oral proposal process used for the recent Savannah River re-compete, although oral presentations will have a role.     A pre-proposal conference is set for Jan. 23, with site tours on Jan. 24 and 25.     Written proposals are due March 15. Oral presentations will follow within a week. Selection will be based mainly on the written proposals, with the orals used to evaluate the technical knowledge, understanding, leadership, appropriateness and ability to work together of the offeror's key personnel.     Offerors will propose three fee arrangements, assuming: they draw money as needed from the federal treasury via a letter-of-credit; they use their own money, then file invoices to get reimbursed every seven days; or they get reimbursed every 14 days.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE CLEANUP via NewsNetJANUARY 19, 1996DRMS offers cheap way to dispose of waste     The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service wants your hazardous waste -- and is willing to accept the liabilities that go with it.     DRMS, a defense agency headquartered in Battle Creek, Mich., wants the military services to come to it for disposal of hazardous waste from their installations.

He said DRMS assumes liability for all actions under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) -- even though CERCLA liability reaches waste generators, such as the installations that give DRMS their waste.     "We spent $25 million on CERCLA cleanup costs alone in the late 1980s," Mank said, adding that DRMS takes care of all fines also.     DRMS offers several basic services as well as some extras, Mank said.     Basic services include: offering regional DOD contracts; waste-code pricing system; tracking/payment at disposal; Milsbills accounting; industry knowledge and contacts; and pricing for accelerated removals.     Other work, such as tank and oil waste separator cleanups, waste characterization and recycling/reclamation, are extra services DRMS is doing on a more regular basis, Mank said.DRMS contracts for disposal     DRMS has long-term and short-term contracts with hazardous-waste companies to remove hazardous waste frequently enough so that installations don't have to get storage permits, said Thomas Wallenfang of DRMS' hazardous contracts division.     DRMS has about 90 long-term RCRA contracts, including five for polychlorinated biphenyl waste and another five for compressed gas cylinders, as well as emergency contracts as needed.     Long-term contracts are usually for 12 months to 18 months with one- to three-year options, Wallenfang said. Each contract is tailored to each specific Defense Dept. customer, he added.     Key DRMS contracting contacts for pre-award information are:     ** DRMS (East) -- Ron Bayes, 616-961-7132     ** DRMS (West) -- Barbara Heffner, 616-961-7136     ** DRMS Chief - Tom Wallenfang, 616-961-7129     Contacts for post-award information are:     ** DRMS (East) - Ethel Carter, 614-962-6501     ** DRMS (West) -- Ernie Bertagnolli, 801-399-7821     ** DRMS Chief - Steve Sprague, 616-961-7107.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE CLEANUP via NewsNetJANUARY 19, 1996Remedial action contracts capacity remains     The Naval Facilities Engineering Command still has plenty of contracting capacity -- more than $1.7 billion -- left in its remedial action contracts (RACs).     The NAVFAC divisions and field activities awarded nine RACs worth more than $75 million. None of the bigger RACs have even come close to reaching contracting capacity. Only one has surpassed the $100 million mark.     Eight other RACs were awarded in the early 1990s worth between $10 million and $40 million. NAVFAC officials in Port Hueneme, Calif., awarded these contracts in 1991 and 1992 for specific contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyl and petroleum, oil and lubricant waste. These contracts have been fully obligated.     Here is a list of the various RAC contracts by division or field activity.

Lt. Col. Robert Wallett, director of environment for the Air Force's civil engineer, told the American Defense Preparedness Assn. Hazardous Material and Waste Management conference in Alexandria, Va., this week that the Air Force needs alternatives to ethylene glycol and propylene glycol for deicing.     The Air Force is prohibited from using ethylene glycol for deicing because of its toxicity, Wallett said. He added that propylene glycol, although widely used, isn't very effective.     The Defense Dept. is required by executive order to reduce its toxic releases by 50% by 1999.      The Air Force is already making strides in that area, Wallett said.     The Air Force has reduced its ozone depleting substances purchases by 78.1% over the past three years, Wallett told the conference. Its hazardous waste disposal numbers have also dropped by 33%, he added.      Wallett said the Air Force is looking into alternatives to other toxic substances the services uses for daily activities. The major thrust areas include: cleaning and degreasing; plating and surface finishing; nonchrome conversion coating; paint stripping; painting and coating materials; painting and coating processes; fire suppression; elimination of toxic materials; hazardous and toxic wastes; and volatile organic compounds.     The Wright Laboratory in Ohio is performing research in these and other areas, Wallett said, adding that industry support is needed.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE CLEANUP via NewsNetJANUARY 19, 1996IG describes recent findings     The Energy Dept.'s inspector general has issued a summary of its audits, inspections and investigations completed in the six months ending Sept. 30, 1995. Here are highlights of reports not previously digested in Defense Cleanup.     ** An M&O contractor used only $1.6 million of the $8.4 million DOE Dept. had approved for merit pay increases. DOE gives this contractor incentives for reducing costs, but shouldn't for withholding pay, the IG said (No. S93IS046).     ** DOE suspended a small, disadvantaged business from its vendor list after an IG investigation. The investigation followed a complaint that a procurement official with an M&O contractor was steering business to the company employing his wife.     The IG found the contractor had given the company $594,000 of work, and the M&O contracting officer had requested 226 orders for additional purchases to be awarded the company. The official said he and his wife had been friends with the company's owner for 10 years (No. I92OR002).     ** IG investigators found invoices showing a DOE subcontractor employee had sold 10.5 tons of DOE's copper pipe to a scrap dealer for more than $25,000 in cash.     In subsequent investigations, the IG found the employee and two others had been removing truckloads of copper pipe and fittings from a salvage area.     The subcontractor, which was demolishing the K-25 cooling tower at DOE's Oak Ridge, Tenn., site, suspended the workers.      DOE agreed with IG recommendations to: add procedures to prevent such thefts; survey all recovered metals for radiation; recoup $19,000 from the subcontractor; and hold the prime contractor more accountable (No. I95OR029).     The IG also issued a number of audit reports during the six months ending Sept. 30, 1995. Here are two highlights:     ** The IG questioned $1.59 million of costs incurred by Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Corp. during cleanup of DOE's Fernald, Ohio, site from Sept. 1, 1992, to Sept. 30, 1993 (No. ER-C-95-03).     ** On June 16, 1995, the IG reviewed the status of efforts to improve management information systems for environmental compliance activities (No. CR-L-95-21).

The announcement will appear in the Commerce Business Daily.     Contractors have grown increasingly interested in this procurement. One source said the major players include ICF Kaiser, Teledyne Brown, Morrison Knudsen, Jacobs Engineering Group, OHM, Parsons, Fluor and Babcock & Wilcox.     EG&G Mound Applied Technologies told DOE last May it would not pursue a planned two-year extension of its contract to run the site, which expires this Sept. 30.     DOE officials realized they needed to act quickly to hire a successor, but first they had to develop a contracting strategy and address stakeholder concerns. The department is considering exercising a contract clause allowing it to unilaterally extend EG&G's contract by a year while it proceeds with the procurement (Defense Cleanup, 6/2/95, 10/20/95, 11/17/95).     DOE has developed a plan to accelerate the site's cleanup by spending less money faster. DOE plans to close out the site in 13 years for just $1.1 billion instead of taking 30 years and $2.2 billion (Defense Cleanup, 6/2/95).

The Army gathered the Denver site's Basin F sludge into a waste pile and capped it. Later, the Environmental Protection Agency urged the Army to thermally desorb contamination from the piled sludge and incinerate the off-gas.

Last year, the Navy transferred the island to the state. However, the Navy, which used the island as a bombing range for 50 years, must now restore it.

The division has since cut costs by nearly $20 million, while beating deadlines and safety goals.     Meanwhile, long-range, cost-cutting efforts have reduced disposal costs from $80/cubic foot of low-level waste in 1992 to $20.

To do that, the service is considering appointing aconversion czar or creating a new office, said Rear Adm.Mark Peleaz, who has just begun working in his newposition as chief of naval research. He heads the Office ofNaval Research (ONR). The person placed in charge ofdefense conversion should have real decision-makingauthority, he said. "Defense conversion needs a clearleadership position."     A central office could help the Navy bettercommunicate technology transfer opportunities, Peleaztold Defense Conversion. "Our job is to communicatewhat we have," he said. "We need to understand wherethings are available commercially and how to maketechnology transfer easier."     The Navy could have a better idea on how toproceed later this week when it receives recommendationsfrom the Naval Research Advisory Committee Panel onDefense Conversion. The panel met late last month atONR in Arlington, Va., to hear industry recommendationsand find out about technology programs in civilianagencies. The panel is made up of industry, university andNavy executives.     Interestingly, there were no presentations of AirForce technology transfer programs, even through oneNavy presenter praised the Air Force for its centralizedapproach.     A central focus of the meeting was preserving theshipbuilding industrial base. Rear Adm. John Shipway,the Navy's program executive officer for submarines, saidthe Navy has two options for preserving the industrial base-- continued low-rate production, or letting the industry gocold and rebuilding it later when it is needed.     Shipway said many of the 200 companies the Navyrecently surveyed are getting out of the ship business.     But a program designed to save some of thosecompanies lacks broad-based support. The AdvancedResearch Projects Agency's (ARPA) shipbuildinginitiative was expected to help American shipyards carveout a few percentage points in the world market. Theprogram focuses on methods of increasing productivity inAmerican shipyards.     The initiative's director Charles Stuart complainedthere is little support for the program in the Clintonadministration. "We need leadership. Someone has tobelieve that it is important," he said.     Stuart added industry support also is needed. "Wehave to do the initiative in a way that gets industryinterested," he said. The program wants to get shipbuildersinvolved in making tankers and container ships in thecommercial market but that might not be so easy. Aftervisiting ARPA this spring, the chairman of the MarineMachinery Assn., Jack Janetatos said he doubted theinitiative would benefit his members. "It came throughquite clearly at the meeting that the only projects to befunded will be those proposed by shipyards," Janetatoswrote in a letter to the association's members.     Nevertheless, Stuart expects $15 million of the $500million TRP program to be set aside for the shipbuildinginitiative.

"The greatest enemy of the businessman is hope,"he told a group of defense contractors at an Association ofUnmanned Vehicle Systems convention last week.     "Hope sustains your belief that next year will bebetter, that today's slump is a temporary downturn, that themarket will recover and you can avoid making the harddecisions with which you are confronted," Perry added."That false hope, which encouraged you to delay thesehard decisions, can be the downfall of your business," hesaid.     It has been difficult for companies to makedecisions because they have not known what the Pentagonis going to do from one year to the next. He said in thepast the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) has beenbased more on fantasy than fact. The Bottom-Up Review,due to be released this month, will provide a more realisticbasis for future year planning, he added.     At a hearing before the House Armed Servicesmilitary acquisition subcommittee late last month, Perryfielded specific questions on DOD's defense conversionplans. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., complained thatfunding for the dual-use Technology Reinvestment Project(TRP) will drop 30% in FY 1994. "I want it maintained atthe highest level possible," he said.     Perry responded that the rationale for reducing thefunding was that several TRP projects awarded in FY1993 will be on-going in FY 1994. However, Perry said,"if we get several thousand proposals we will want torevaluate the resources."     DOD might have to do that in light of all the interestthe program is generating. Dr. John Gudas, a member ofthe government council which oversees the TRP, toldDefense Conversion he expects to see thousands ofproposals come pouring in by the July 23 deadline. Hesaid the council still believes it can process all theproposals in time for contract awards in the fall. Gudas isalso an official at the National Institute of Standards andTechnology.     At the hearing, Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,complained that major defense companies feel left out ofthe TRP. Perry acknowledged that the TRP is directed tosubsystems developers, which are often medium-sizedcompanies. The TRP "is not directed at large systemsintegrators," he said.     Perry noted a portion of TRP funding will godirectly to the Commerce and Labor Depts. This year, themoney was placed in the DOD budget and transferred tothe other agencies.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE CONVERSION via NewsNetJULY 5, 1993Milspec under attack from all sides     Military specifications are under increasing attackfrom industry and the Defense Dept. and odds are therewill be substantial changes to DOD's acquisition rules inthe coming months.     At least that's what Deputy Defense SecretaryWilliam Perry told the House Armed Services militaryacquisition subcommittee late last month.     Perry wants Congress to allow DOD to buycommercial products without all the Pentagon paperworknow required. "We spend billions of dollars on purelycommercial products," he said. "We will need legislation"to change the system "and will ask for it in a month or so."     Perry said DOD is proposing three to five pilotprograms to streamline acquisition. The Pentagon willpropose the acquisition changes later this month, he said.     The pilot programs will allow contractors to bypassmilspecs and other regulations for contracts valued under$100,000. The purpose of the pilot program is two-fold."It gives us psychological momentum and gets us movingon real programs using commercial acquisition procedureswhile Congress is making the legislative changes," he said.     "We will seek a waiver from Congress on thelegislative procedures we find most onerous," Perry said ata separate meeting of industry executives in Washingtonlast week. "We have legislative authority already to specifythe programs and particular laws which we must waive,"he added.     For years DOD has promised to revise acquisitionrules, but Perry said it's different this time. For one, thereis a greater necessity to change. The dramatic decline in thebudget encourages reform, he said.     "I have leadership from the top urging me to do thisand I have a team underneath me who believe in reformand are dedicated and committed to pursuing it," he said.     Frustration over milspec has reached the boilingpoint for Willis Willoughby, the Navy's director ofproduct integrity. "Milspec is a piece of trash, but you can'tkill it," he said, speaking at an industry meeting at theOffice of Naval Research in Arlington, Va., recently.     Willoughby stressed something has to be done withmilspec procurement requirements because there isnothing in them that deals with design or manufacturingissues.     Willoughby said he tried to get around milspecregulations recently, but was shot down by higherauthority. In March, he sent a memo to 200 contractorstelling them they could start using ISO 9000 standards orthe equivalent American National Standards. Shortlythereafter, the Office of the Secretary of Defense told allcontractors to stop using ISO 9000.     "DOD immediately sent out a letter saying we didn'thave the authority to do it." Willoughby described DOD'sattitude as, "you have to come to the great Guru and seewhat we tell you to do.     "People don't want to upset their fiefdoms bychanging milspec. If you try to bring about any changethey will circle your wagon every time. I tried to do thesame thing years ago," he added.     Martin Bollinger, a vice president of Booz Allen &Hamilton, said DOD could cut its $30 billion inacquisition overhead costs by adopting commercialpractices.     Bollinger agreed with Willoughby saying "the TQMmentality makes the situations worse. TQM calls forcontinuous incremental change. What's needed is a one-step function."Some changes in place now     While milspec reform is going on, DOD hasalready loosened some requirements for developing dual-use technologies under independent research anddevelopment (IR&D) money. DOD sent a letter to theCouncil of Defense and Space Industry Associations thisspring, explaining the changes.     Specifically, section 802 of the National DefenseAuthorization Act for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 madesignificant changes. The legislation eliminated most of thedetailed administrative procedures DOD had in place tolimit IR&D costs. Under section 802, IR&D costs areallowable as indirect expenses on contracts. Costlimitations apply to major contractors during a three-yeartransition from FY 1993 to FY 1995.     Allowable IR&D costs are limited to projects thatare of potential interest to DOD, including activities toincrease the development and promotion of efficient andeffective application of dual-use technologies.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE CONVERSION via NewsNetJULY 5, 1993Hard bargains found at air show     PARIS -- The Paris Air Show was the site of hardtrading between western companies and the Former SovietUnion (FSU).

Pentagon acquisition chief Paul Kaminski formally approved theconcept in a Dec. 21 memo that calls for the demonstration of atactical UAV system within 18 months, as well as a pre-planned productimprovement (P3I) to build upon air vehicle capabilities.        Kaminski's approval came on the heels of an agreement brokeredby the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in mid-December betweenthe Army and Navy over divergent system requirements (Defense Daily,Dec. 18, 1995).       The original suggestion to scrap the traditional acquisitionprocess in lieu of an accelerated plan came last July after a year-long delay in releasing a request for proposals (RFP).       Formerly known as the Maneuver variant, the Tactical UAV(TUAV) ACTD will include the procurement of six complete systems, twoMobile Maintenance Facilities (MMFs), and eight attrition air vehiclesand Modular Mission Payloads (MMPs), according to Kaminski's memo.       Moreover, the TUAV "should have a maximum projected cost of$350,000 for the 33rd air vehicle and sensor," Kaminski stipulates."The TUAV selected for award should also have a maximum projected costof $300,000 for the 100th air vehicle and sensor."        The system is envisioned to have a range of 200 kilometers, beable to fly for three to four hours, and be launched from land or sea.       Officials in the Navy-led UAV Joint Program Office are anxiousto release a draft RFP for the TUAV ACTD as early as next week. Afinal RFP is expected by the end of the month. Proposals are duearound March 11 and a final contract award should be made on"reasonably quick order," JPO spokesman Ray Colemon said yesterday.       But the final RFP, and subsequent contract award, may not comeso soon, despite the level of importance the Army and Navy haveascribed to the tactical UAV mission, military and industry officialscontend.        For example, Kaminski has directed several things be completedfirst to ensure a successful ACTD is pursued. The TUAV program managerhas been directed to develop an ACTD management plan which willinclude TUAV life cycle costs, logistics support, manpower, training,and transition to production. The program manager has yet to beselected, Colemon said.       The question of how best to transition from an ACTD to fullproduction--if such a decision is made--has plagued ACTDs in the pastand in this case has been a concern of Kaminski's.        Pentagon officials are grappling with the production issuewith another UAV program that was developed and built as an ACTD, theTier II Predator. The Predator ACTD, which ends in June, has beenhailed as a success for its quick development and its deployment lastyear in support of NATO forces in Bosnia.       An Integrated Product Team, which will evaluate the TUAV'smilitary utility, supportability, and producibility, is also beingestablished under Kaminski's orders.       And lastly, the director of the Defense AirborneReconnaissance Office has been tasked to "develop a ground reception,processing, and control system architecture and a schedule forachieving interoperability with other UAVs, collection systems, andcommand, control, communications, computers, intelligence,surveillance, and reconnaissance systems," Kaminski's memo states.        One industry official also foresees industry competitorshaving difficulty meeting the requirements of the forthcoming RFPquickly. He points out that the ACTD requirements are significantlydifferent than the original Maneuver UAV program. In particular, therange now called for is almost four times greater than in the originalprogram, which called for between 30 and 50 kilometers. "[Industry]can't add weight or fuel [to go that distance] without re-engineeringthe whole thing," the industry official said.        According to military and industry UAV officials, thepotential competitors for the TUAV ACTD contract include Westinghouse,Textron, Alliant Techsystems, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon , a Boeing-General Atomics team, and interested Canadian and German firms.        Kaminski is expected to decide soon on the fate of another UAVprogram, the Hunter short-range UAV. The Joint Staff recommendedterminating the TRW -developed system late last year after numerousair vehicle crashes and programmatic blunders.        According to officials familiar with the discussions, some ofthe seven Hunter systems resulting from the existing productioncontract, including 56 air vehicles, will divvied up among operationalArmy units--and perhaps even the Marine Corps--over the next fewmonths. But no additional vehicles will be built.       Some of the vehicles are likely to be put in storage, as theJoint Staff recommended, an Army official said.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996AMERICAN PUBLIC SUPPORTS DEFENSE BUT FAVORS CUTS, POLL FINDS       Most Americans support a strong national defense, but favor abudget much lower than the present level of defense spending,according to a Dec. 19 study conducted by the Program on InternationalPolicy Attitudes (PIPA).       A modest majority of Americans support significant cuts in thedefense budget and want defense spending to be "on the table" in theeffort to balance the budget, PIPA says.       In addition, PIPA says that Americans overwhelmingly opposethe $7 billion addition to the defense budget and that most Americanswant to see more emphasis on multi-lateral approaches to dealing withproblems of security to relieve the U.S. of its "world policeman"role.       The study was based on a nationwide poll of 1,207 adultsconducted last Nov. 18-25, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3percent to 4 percent. PIPA is a joint program of the Center forInternational Security Studies at the University of Maryland and theCenter for Study of Policy Attitudes.        Asked whether U.S. defense spending is more or less than itneeds to be, 53 percent said it is more, 32 percent said it is less,and 10 percent said it's about right.       If the government were to make deep cuts in defense spending,it appears that the public would support them, the study concludes.When asked to "imagine that the president and Congress decided to cutdefense spending by 20 percent," 56 percent said they would supportthis move, while 39 percent said they would not.       When it was specified that the money would be directed toimproving education, fighting crime and cutting the deficit, supportfor defense cuts was even higher--72 percent supported a cut of 20percent, with only 23 percent opposed.       Also, 63 percent of those polled agreed with the argument thatU.S. defense spending "has weakened the U.S. economy and given someallies an economic edge." They agree with the statement, "it is timefor the U.S. to cut back its defense spending and make its economymore competitive."       This feeling, PIPA says, is not offset by concern forpreserving jobs, a familiar argument used by lawmakers and defenseleaders. Only 43 percent agreed with the argument that defensespending should not be cut because "many people will lose their jobswhen bases are closed and factories are shut down." Furthermore, 67percent agreed that "it does not make sense to keep spending money ondefense to keep jobs."Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996DoD AWARDS $137 MILLION IN TRP CONTRACTS       The Pentagon last month awarded 34 contracts totalling $137.4million for the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP), an Clintonadministration initiative aimed to nurture dual-use technologies.

Developed at the Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB,Mass., the Multi-mission Advanced Tactical Terminal (MATT) can deliverover-the-horizon threat data by using national intelligence satellitesas early warning sensors, says John Kasianowicz, program manager inESC's Intelligence and Information Warfare Systems program office.        "Our pilots can now go virtually anywhere in the world andknow exactly where a threat is before on-board sensors are engaged,"he said. The fighter aircraft equipped with MATT receive encrypteddigital information from national intelligence sources. Theinformation is relayed by satellite and distributed through variousmilitary correlation centers.       During recent field tests, the system demonstrated its abilityto deliver updated situational awareness and allow aircrews to avoidthreats that may not have been known during mission planning, the AirForce says.       The MATT system is a seven by nine-inch unit about two feetdeep, and is designed to fit in the avionics compartment of tacticalfighter aircraft.        The Air Force has entered in to a Cooperative Research andDevelopment Agreement with production contractor AlliedSignalCommunications Systems, Inc., for engineering support for futureimprovements to the MATT system.       Each MATT unit is expected to cost $150,000 and the initialproduction run calls for 120 systems.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996ARMY IMPLEMENTS CHANGES IN CIVILIAN ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT       The Army Acquisition Corps is implementing changes in themanagement of senior civilians to improve the quality andprofessionalism of its acquisition work force, the Army says in a newsrelease.       The initiative was undertaken at the recommendation of aninternal study. Under the new policy, "top level acquisition corpsmanagers can expect change-of-assignment moves and board selectionsfor promotions, much like their military counterparts," according tothe Army's Dec. 22 statement.        The Army is setting up a support structure to help guidecivilians in their careers. Functional assignment officers will guideemployees in their careers and facilitate assignments that aid intraining and career development.       Civilians who want to advance will be required to begeneralists instead of specialists. To this end, the Army plans torequire these civilians to rotate assignments every five years.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996STUDY SEES 50 PERCENT GROWTH IN U.S. EW MARKET BY 2001       The U.S. electronic warfare (EW) market projects U.S. saleswill grow from $1 billion last year to $1.45 billion by 2001,according to a new study by the market research firm Frost & Sullivan.       The study says the market will decline slightly to $946million in 1997  but rebound later in the decade when programscompleting development move into production.

Overall, U.S. R&D spending will increase to about $174billion, 1.7 percent more than the $171 billion the National ScienceFoundation estimates was spent last year, Battelle said yesterday.Battelle says that the period of stagnating U.S. R&D spending in theearly 1990s is ending and that the near future should see increasedspending.       "Despite the fact that industry and the federal government aredoing battle with their respective budgets and changes are beingforced by major trends in the global economy, the commitment totoday's research, is critical to tomorrow's economic strength," JulesDuga, Battelle research scientist and the forecasts principal author,said.       Battelle, based in Columbus, Ohio, is a non-profit researchfirm which works for government and industry clients.       Among the study's predictions for 1996 are: federal R&Dspending will drop to $60.6 billion, about a half-percent less than1995; industry will increase R&D spending 3 percent to $104.6 billion;the remaining $8.8 billion in spending will be made up by universitiesand non-profit groups; private industry will increasingly look foropportunities to outsource internal R&D functions; an increasing shareof U.S. industry's R&D will be performed off-shore, primarily infacilities owned by the same industry; and the government's efforts atbudget cutting combined with changes in the national science policywill affect federal R&D support and the federal laboratories.[Contact: Jules Duga, 614/424-6512]Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996DEFENSE BRIEFSThe Air Force and Navy's Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) programwon the Air Force Association's 1995 Outstanding Achievement Award forAcquisition Reform for 1995, the Air Force said late last month.

A spokesman for Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), one of the mostoutspoken opponents of this deal and the recent FSX agreementwith Japan, added that the deal will probably be finalized withinthree to four months, after which Dixon will seek a GeneralAccounting Office review of the program before Congress considersany alterations to the arrangement.     The talks--which will focus mainly on offsets, acongressional source told DEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL lastweek--come three weeks after Korea chose to purchase 120McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighters to serve as its air force'sfrontline aircraft to counter North Korea's newest aircraft, theSoviet MiG-29 Fulcrum.  General Dynamics' cheaper F-16 was thealternative, but was rejected in favor of the F/A-18's moreadvanced avionics and "superior...two-engine safety and maritimecapability."     A Korean aerospace industry source said recently that thedecision may have also hinged on the fact that beyond-visual-range missiles are not standard items on the F-16's combat suite.The Korean air force currently has 36 F-16s in its inventory.Deal To Hinge On Quality, Not Percentage Of Offsets     Congress, meanwhile, has already stated it will not allowthe deal to go through unless Korea and McDonnell Douglas canprove that America's industrial base is not harmed and that U.S.offsets negotiated are no more than 30 percent of the deal'stotal cost.  Opponents are also worried over the possibletransfer of sensitive technology to Korea, which will alsoreceive guidance from McDonnell Douglas on creating an indigenousaerospace industry.     American industry officials in Korea, however, say that thecountry will not receive any technology that it does not have.Additionally, they add that while Korea will learn to buildadvanced aircraft, the nation's aerospace industry is barely inits infancy and is years away from being able to design and builda simple aircraft, and decades away from be able to design, buildand produce an indigenous fighter.     Even so, congressional sources told us that 30 percentoffsets may not be allowed depending on what specifically theywill involve.  The Dixon spokesman said, "We have to see whatexactly is entailed in that 30 percent requirement."  The stafferadded "we have to see the notification from the White House thatthe deal was signed and the details of the agreement."     He noted that in 1988, Congress passed a resolution thatallows U.S. subcontractors on international projects to addressthe administration if company officials see the agreement or itsoffsets as harmful. "If we're giving up technical data that oneof the U.S. subcontractors either owns or has rights to, or whichwould adversely affect that company, they can bring this toCommerce or DoD...," the aid said.Special Supplement On European Integration IncludedWith This Issue For Regular Subscribers     An industry source recently confirmed for DEFENSE MARKETINGINTERNATIONAL that the deal may not come down to the percentageof offsets, but the "quality of those offsets."  The officialsaid that high offsets involving the purchase of low or mediumtechnology items, or non-technology items, such as agricultureequipment, would be seen as more favorable by Congress than adeal requiring the purchase or sale of advanced and high-techaerospace systems.     A Korean government official said the aircraft will costabout $35 million a copy, putting the total cost of the programsomewhere between $3.4 and $4 billion, not including additionalsupport equipment and spares.  The first is slated for deliveryto Korea in 1993.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990GERMAN/U.K. DEFENSE MINISTERS TO MEET ON EFA RADAR     British Defense Minister Tom King and West German DefenseMinister Dr. Gerhard Stoltenberg have scheduled a meeting duringthe next three weeks in which they will discuss ongoing politicalproblems with the radar system for the European Fighter Aircraft(EFA), the director for EFA marketing at British Aerospaceheadquarters said in an interview with DEFENSE MARKETINGINTERNATIONAL.     Ned Frith added that the problem has been dramaticallyoverstated by industry and the press, and that the program willcome down to either utilizing a common radar, or having eachprogram nation independently install a system it prefers.  "Itwould be nice if there were a common radar," he said.  "But itmay very well be that there will not be a common system."     The competing systems are GEC Avionics (U.K.) teamed withAEG (Germany) on the MSD-200--favored by Germany, and Ferranti'sECR-90--favored by Britain, Spain and Italy.  [EFA fly-away costis currently put between $17 and $20 million per copy.]     As far as program milestones go, he said that the radarsituation has not affected the development schedule of thefighter.  "You don't need a radar to develop carbon compositewings or body panels, or engines, or landing gear."  Eight EFAprototypes are slated to be constructed by the mid-1990s, ofwhich three fuselages are nearly complete (see below).     The defense ministers are also expected to address problemsrelated to workshare.  Work distribution for the fighter is 33percent each for Germany (MBB) and Britain (BAe), 21 percent forItaly (Aeritalia), and 13 percent for Spain (Casa).  Frith saidthat although the development phase of the program is fullyfunded by all governments, the levels are unequal.  However,according to the original MOU (signed in 1988), all countriesinvolved are to aid in development in all of the aircraft'ssystems--the cost of which may prevent the smaller nations frombeing fully involved.  "But that is pretty close to beingsolved," Frith said.Fuselages To Be Tested This Spring     The forward fuselages for the first two European FighterAircraft (EFA) prototypes are under construction at BritishAerospace's Warton Airfield, England, in preparation for groundand flight tests to be conducted later this spring, Frith said.     The first body section, designated P.01, will be completedthis spring and fitted with electronic and hydraulic systemsbefore being shipped to Messerschmidt Boelkow Blohm (MBB) in WestGermany for final aircraft assembly.  The second fuselage,designated P.02 and being developed strictly for ground testing,is now being fitted with a cockpit for pilot simulations andtesting of cockpit controls and systems.  It is also being fittedwith the Crew Escape Unit (CEU), which will also undergo groundsystems tests.  BAe said that 12 more fuselages are planned inthe next few years to support EFA's ground and flight testprograms.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990THOMSON-CSF TAKES FORMAL CONTROL OF PHILIPS DIVISIONS     Thomson-CSF (France)--having signed a formal agreement totransfer controlling interest in Philips' (the Netherlands)defense electronics businesses over to the French giant--plans toincorporate the new division, and two other recently purchasedEuropean interests, into a new holding company called Thomson-TRTDefense.     Company officials said last week the sale, agreed to inprinciple last August, entails to transfer of 80 percent interestin the Philips subsidiary Hollandse Signaalapparaten B.V. toThomson.  That company currently develops and produces aircraftradar fire control systems, military telecommunicationsequipment, and command and control systems for the Netherlandsnavy, air force and army.  The world's leading command andcontrol systems exporter, Signaalapparaten's 1988 sales (mostrecent data) totaled over $469.974 million. Company officialsreiterated that "the increasing costs of developing and producingdefense equipment and the pressure on defense budgets,particularly in Europe, make cooperation necessaryfor...governments and companies.Plans To Create New French Electronics Firm     Also under the deal, Thomson acquired 49 percent of Philips'Belgium subsidiary, MBLE, which has activities in militarytelecommunications, airborne radar systems, and munitionelectronics.  MBLE's sales in 1988 totaled over $26.110 million.Having already acquired 99 percent of the defense operations ofFrance's TRT corp., Thomson plans to bring the three separatebusinesses together as Thomson-TRT Defense--a deal that wasfinalized on Jan. 8, company representatives said.     TRT, a company with annual sales of more than $208.877million in 1988, develops and manufactures opto-electronicsystems, munition electronics, and radio navigation andcommunication equipment.

However, the budget is still abill and is under parliamentary review.     Under the new figures, procurement funding for the country'sservices is as follows: Army, $4.031 billion (23 percent); Navy,$4.117 billion (23.5 percent); Air Force, $4.305 billion (24.5percent); and $5.060 billion for the Gendarmerie and commonforces (29 percent).     General funding for total French defense expenditures breaksdown as follows: Research and Development, $5.266 billion (30.13percent); equipment and ammunition, $8.370 billion (47.75percent); Infrastructure, $1.561 billion (8.89 percent);personnel, $360.206 million (2.04 percent); maintenance, $1.955billion (11.20 percent).     The main programs each service is working on includes:Continued procurement of 46 advanced AMX Leclerc tanks, 284armored vehicles, and 17 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS);Continued refits to the navy's fleet of nuclear ballistic missilesubmarines, a refit of the Crusader to fill the sea air defenserole until the Rafale comes on line in the mid-1990s andcontinued work on the Rafale; and continued procurement of Mirage2000s and development of the Rafale advanced fighter for the airforce.U.K. SEEKS NEARLY 5 PERCENT INCREASE IN DEFENSE FOR 1990     Britain is seeking a 4.8 percent increase in its defensebudget for 1990, up from $32.666 current billions in 1989, to$34.243 billion this fiscal year.  A top Ministry of Defenseofficial tells DEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL that the 1990figure is only an MoD projection and that the exact figure (whichis classified) will not be released until the bill reachesParliament this spring.     Broken down by force structure, funding for general programsis as follows: strategic nuclear force, $1.794 billion; generalnavy combat forces, $3.746 billion; European theatre groundforces, $5.351 billion; army combat forces, $283.266 million; airforce general forces, $5.477 billion.  Research and Developmentfor current programs, $3.683 billion; training, $2.109 billion;general equipment support, $1.637 billion; other support, $6.704billion.     The MoD has also projected (in current billions) anapproximate 5 percent increase for the 1990-91 budget, or $36.023billion, and just over a four percent increase for the 1991-92budget, or $37.57 billion.     For 1990, continuing navy procurements include anotherTrafalgar class nuclear submarine.  That order was initiated inMay 1979.  Since then, the MoD has placed "three in service; thelatest, HMS Trenchant, entered service in February (1989).  Thefourth, HMS Talent, is planned to enter service this year."  Fourconventionally-powered submarines also came into servicethroughout 1989.  Additionally, the Navy is currently holdingcompetitions for another batch of Type 23 frigates for serviceinto the next century and adds that further orders for the newestHarrier, the Sea Harrier, will be placed with British Aerospace,the prime contractor.     The army brought a sixth Challenger battle tank regimentinto service in 1989, and plans to bring a seventh this year.Additionally, the Army says, "The Chieftain tank must be replacedas soon as practicable, and Vickers defense systems have beengiven the opportunity to show that they can deliver Challenger 2Mk 2 to specifications, time and cost."  The Army is currentlyfunding the demonstration phase, which ends this September.Future plans include development of the high-velocity Rapier 2000tactical surface-to-air missile, which will form the bases of athird air defense regiment.  New systems slated to come on linein the early 1990s include: the Multiple Launch Rocket System(MLRS); the Phoenix remotely piloted vehicle, and the Challengerarmored repair and recovery vehicle.     The air force brought its first squadron of Harrier GR5sinto service last year, and have an order in place for deliveryof 26 Tornado GR1s to offset peacetime cuts.  The service alsobrought its first Tristar air tanker into service.

WOULD REPLACE COMMERCE DEPT.     A new piece of legislation facing Congress when it returnsJan. 23 would abolish the U.S. Department of Commerce and replaceit with a new Department of Industry and Technology.  The statedaim of the bill, sponsored by Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), "will beto enhance American competitiveness and marry commercialpromotion activities--both domestic and international--withtechnology development activities," Glenn said.Creates New Civilian Technology Agency     The legislation would also create a new agency modeled onthe Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).The Advanced Civilian Technology Agency (ACTA) is envisioned asproviding seed money for specific high-risk, long-term, high-impact areas of generic technology development not being pursuedby the private sector.     According to Glenn, the ACTA would provide funding on acost-sharing basis with industry and be able to recover its costshare from profitable projects.  He said the current Sematechprogram is a good example of the type of project ACTA would fund.Other technologies mentioned by Glenn include high-definitionimaging systems, biotechnology and superconductivity.Elevates Technology And Economics To NSC Level     In an effort to increase the influence of economic and tradeissues in national security matters, the Glenn bill (S 1978),known as the Trade and Technology Promotion Act, would place thesecretaries of Industry and Technology and the Treasury as wellas the U.S. Trade Representative on the National Security Council(NSC).     The senator cites three years of negotiations between theUnited States and Japan on the FSX coproduction agreement"without significant input" from the Secretary of Commerce or theU.S. Trade Representative as a reason for adding these officialsto the membership of the NSC.     Glenn introduced the bill the last day Congress was insession before the holiday break.  It has thus far not beenassigned to a committee and there is no set timetable for action.This is at least the second time he has introduced suchlegislation.  The new bill, he said, has significant changes overprevious bills.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1990U.S. LIKELY TO EASE HIGH-TECH TRADE WITH EASTERN EUROPE     Export barriers between the United States and the EasternEuropean nations of Poland and Hungary will be dismantled "to thedegree that it does not affect our national security," accordingto Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.  "We're willing to doit with them because they have told us they will protect us andgive us the opportunity to review what they're doing with thehigh-tech items."  Observers say the first such exports wouldmost likely be advanced computer and telecommunications systems.     Mosbacher was not so free with the Soviet Union.  Mosbachersaid more caution will be demonstrated before making it easer totrade high-technology items with the Soviets.  He noted theSoviets are still a threat and that it will take awhile beforethe United States is willing to give it similar permission."Eventually they may be included," he said, "but not yet."     Relaxation of export restrictions could open up a multi-million dollar export market for U.S. companies that arecurrently restricted from exporting much of what they do best.     Such a change will depend not just on the United Statesreworking its regulations but an agreement by the 17 membernations that make up the Coordinating Committee on MultilateralExport Controls (COCOM) that governs what technologies arepermitted to be sold to Eastern Bloc nations.  However, reachingan agreement is expected to be easy since the United Statestraditionally seeks the most stringent controls.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1990SDI FY 91 REQUEST TO BE LESS SUBSTANTIAL THAN PLANNED     The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) will expect to getless funding in FY 1991 for its research effort to defend againstballistic missiles than was planned even a year ago.  However, ithas not yet been worked out in Pentagon budget meetings exactlyhow much to request when the budget goes to Congress later thismonth.     SDI Organization Director, Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan, saidthere is no direct answer to the question of how much he'llrequest in FY 1991.  "We were planning a substantial increase,"Monahan told DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS, but noted that DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney has given word out for cuts everywhere sothat an increase in SDI funding for FY 1991 "may not be thatmuch."  When pushed for a range, Monahan said, "We don't know ifwe're going for $4.6 billion or $5.1 billion."  He said it isstill being worked out.     Any of those figures would be a decline.  The last Reaganbudget anticipated seeking $6.7 billion in SDI funding for thenext fiscal year.Phase One Deployment Still Possible     Nevertheless, Monahan said a Phase I Strategic DefenseSystem (SDS) could still be deployed "in the late 1990s."  "Wehave the technology," he said.  However, to do so would requirebudget increases on the order of 25 percent per year after thedecision is made.  President Bush said over the summer that hewanted to make such a decision in four years.  However, Monahansaid with the current budget trend "you're talking about someextension of that time."FY 1990 Cuts To Slip Near & Far Term Projects     Of more immediate importance, Monahan said the cuts to theSDI program made necessary by the magnitude of the congressionalreductions to the FY 1990 budget request were "balanced."  Thatbalancing act means that there has been "a slip in near-term anda slip in far-term systems," Monahan said.  He would not be morespecific regarding the FY '90 restructurings.  Plans within theorganization call for making the changes public in early January.Maintains Need For SDI And A Version Of An LPS     Despite the changes taking place in Eastern Europe and theSoviet Union, Monahan stressed that the mission SDI is to fulfillstill exists.  With its move to more mobile missiles and otherenhancements of its strategic nuclear offensive forces, Monahannoted, "the ability of the Soviet Union has actually increased"in recent years.  In fact, he pointed out, some people argue thatstrategic defenses make even more sense in the event of massivereductions--such as a 50 percent reduction in warheads by boththe United States and the Soviet Union--because such reductionswould place a limit on how much has to be defended against.     Monahan came down in favor of a Limited Protection System(LPS) to defend against Third World or accidental launches, butstressed the need for any LPS to be part of the Phase I StrategicDefense System now in the Demonstration/ Validation phase.  Withthe possibility of 20 nations having ballistic missiles by theturn of the century, Monahan said defense against such missilesis probably one of the best arguments to date for an SDS.     But he also made it clear that he favors a space-basedsystem because it can defend against any warhead launched atanybody from anywhere in the world.  The ground-basedinterceptors currently being pushed by others in the defensecommunity for a more near-term LPS, he said, are limited toprotecting the continental United States, would protect against amuch more limited threat, and may worry U.S. allies if it lookslike the United States and the Soviet Union are going to decideto defend only themselves.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1990U.S. SEEKS FUNDS FOR ATOM SMASHER PROJECT     The United States, because of recent budget constraints, hasinquired about Japanese financial support for the construction ofthe Superconducting Supercollider (SSC) which is due to becompleted at an underground site in Texas by 1996.  The SSC,which will be the largest Particle Accelerator in the world whenit is completed, will be 26 kilometers in circumference.  It isbeing developed to further understand the origins of matter,which it accomplishes by accelerating subatomic particles totremendous speeds and then smashing these particles together toexamine the residue that is produced.  The United States isasking Japan to fund $1 billion of the proposed $4.4 billionproject.  The United States also asked Canada, Italy, South Koreaand India to help fund the project.  India has offered $5million.  Japanese participation seems unlikely since the mood inCongress does not support such cooperation at this time.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1990HONEYWELL DEMONSTRATES OPTICAL INTERCONNECTS     Honeywell and Thinking Machines Corp. have successfullydemonstrated the world's first optical interconnects inside acommercial parallel processor.  The demonstration was conductedby the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and wasmonitored by Naval Air Systems Command.     The test was conducted on a processor known as theConnection Machine. This computer was modified by Honeywell toreplace the existing backplane wiring with the new opticalinterconnects.  Where in the past the old wiring consisted of1,000 wires, the new interconnects require only two.  Sources atHoneywell state that the new interconnects will make it possibleto have larger, more powerful machines.  They also said this typeof configuration will enhance the abilities of machines toperform simulation faster than before. The interconnect consistsof two 400 Mbps (megabits/second) optical fibers withtransmitter/receiver modules.  The total package is a 16,000-processor demonstration system.  Sources at Honeywell said thatthey will develop an enhanced version of the optical interconnectboard.  The new version will operate at 1.1 Gbps(gigabits/second) with a sixfold reduction in size and aneightfold reduction in power dissipation.  Honeywell believesthat this is possible by using custom gallium arsenide andsilicon integrated circuits and multichip packaging.     The new optical interconnects have tremendous potential inthe area of defense.  They will make it possible to incorporatenew types of technologies that will lead to increases inperformance capabilities while at the same time enhancingsurvivability.  These enhanced modules are scheduled fordemonstration in the first quarter of 1990.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1990U.S. R&D SPENDING SEEN RISING 4.8% TO $138.7 BILLION IN '90     Expenditures in the United States for research anddevelopment totaled $132.4 billion in 1989 and will increase 4.8percent to $138.7 billion in 1990, according to the annual R&Dforecast of Battelle.  U.S. R&D spending totaled $125 billion in1988.  The real increase in 1990 is estimated at 2.1%, versus the10-year average of 3.1%, Battelle said.     The forecast points out that increases in defense spendingare directed at tactical programs and advanced technologydevelopment, as well as manufacturing technology, while the R&Dbudget for strategic programs and the expansion of the technologybase show small decreases.

This part of the program, nowscheduled to end in July, is to evaluate prototypes that haveonly minimum capability. Then, the Air Force will choose onecontractor team to enter the full-scale development phase.Air Force officials are under pressure to produce a new fighterthat is a significant improvement over current planes because theATF likely will be in service well into the next century, theformer official said. Diminished tensions in Europe also couldallow the U.S. to take its time with the ATF, he said."Is that extra six months or a year going to give us a lot moreconfidence, or even help us fix some things up front that shouldbe redesigned? It would be hard to argue against it," the formerofficial said. "There is a legitimate reality that a lot ofthings can be changed without a great degree of immediate risk."At press time, the Air Force had not responded to inquiries byDefense Week on possible extensions of the ATF dem/val phase.The $64-billion ATF program pits a team of Northrop Corp. andMcDonnell Douglas Corp. against a team of Lockheed Corp., GeneralDynamics Corp. and Boeing Co., each producing two prototypes tobe evaluated by the Air Force and the Navy. The Navy is a juniorpartner in the Air Force-led program, but might drop out in orderto divert funds to other programs, according to Navy andcongressional sources.The Northrop team already has one prototype completed, while theLockheed team is still assembling its first ATF entrant,according to officials of the company.Even if the two teams deliver approximately equal amounts of testdata to the Air Force during the ATF competition, there would belittle prototype flying time, "and you'd be betting a lot onwhose paper you believe," the congressional source said.But little would be gained from extending the dem/val phase ifadditional money isn't provided, according to the former AirForce official. After the Air Force extended the program inOctober, Northrop and McDonnell Douglas officials wrote to AirForce Secretary Donald Rice saying they were cutting back companyspending on the program to the minimum required by the contractbecause their resources were already stretched too thin."It's not only unfair, but also unrealistic to expect thecompanies to increase what they're spending on the program," theformer Air Force official said.Changes to the ATF program also could lead to severe controversywhen the Air Force selects the winning team, the former Air Forceofficial said.  Selecting Lockheed's plane over Northrop's wouldlead to charges that the Air Force broke its own rules byextending the contest and unfairly favored Lockheed, according tothe former Air Force official."[The Northrop team] will be very upset if they don't win thecompetition because they felt they were ready to go and were onschedule. The extension will provide an advantage to the otherteam, because eventually they'll catch up," said the former AirForce official.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990PARIS WILL SHY AWAY FROM MULTI-NATION ARMS PROJECTSby Timothy McCunePARIS--Stung by the recent failure of two high-profiletransatlantic arms programs, French officials have redrawn plansfor future joint weapons ventures. Officials said France willshun large, multinational development efforts in favor ofbilateral agreements.France will seek bilateral agreements, primarily with the U.S.and Great Britain, and limit other efforts to "three or fourpartners," according to Philippe Roger, the second-rankingDefense Ministry official on western alliance arms cooperation.Large scale codevelopment failures with the Modular Stand-OffWeapon (MSOW) and the Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile(ASRAAM) mean that France should "draw lessons for the future"and avoid similar efforts, Roger said."There should be no bitterness about that, but...in anycooperation where there are more than three or four equalpartners in the development, it's an illusion to think that itwill work," Roger said.The MSOW program began in 1987 and was to be a family of air-to-ground weapons using common components. The program included theU.S., France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada and Spain. The U.S.and Great Britain withdrew in September from the program citingbudget shortfalls and differing national strategies.ASRAAM, which was to replace the Sidewinder missile, was startedin 1982 with the U.S., France, West Germany and Norway. Franceand the U.S. pulled out of the program, and when West Germanywithdrew from ASRAAM in late July, the program was considered tobe defunct."We can have a nucleus of three, or at the most four, equalpartners to do the development and other nations to participatelater in the production. Statistically, [large efforts] don'twork, so we have to concentrate on more efficient ways," Rogersaid.The importance of the shift in French plans is heightened by aneasing of tensions in Europe. Shrinking defense budgets in Europemean cooperative agreements will become even more important forofficials in allied capitals, Roger said. There will be "a kindof quality escalation, since disarmament is only concerningnumbers," he said."I think the recent upheavals should encourage prudent militaryplanners [in France] to get even closer to the United States thanwe were before," Roger said. He said his government will meet"early this year" with U.S. acquisition representatives todiscuss joint ventures."What we are not satisfied with is that there are no bilateralcodevelopment agreements with the U.S. It is nonsense, becausefor many, many years France has had the second biggest [researchand development] military budget in the alliance. It's going tobe even more so in the future," Roger said.Roger said government officials will be less willing to OK largedevelopment expenditures for programs that will produce fewerweapons. "For us that means more R and D cooperation and morebuying systems off the shelf, which is the ultimate way to notspend too much on R and D," Roger said.Franco-American attempts to sell off-the-shelf weapons to eachother also have had their high-profile failures. The Frenchnavy's desire to buy McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighters wasthwarted recently when French Defense Minister Jean-PierreChevenement opted to modernize existing aircraft while awaitingthe French Rafale.The decision came two years after a French-designed candidate forthe U.S. Army's forward area air defense system (FAADS) wasrejected by the Pentagon.Roger said these decisions showed that buying large foreign-builtsystems "flies in the face of established powers of eachcountry," and a more practical approach to cooperation is tocross-market subsystems rather than big-ticket items.The French official said there "has been some mixing ofcommercial interests with military interests" by the U.S. toavoid competition with French companies. "We find it difficult tounderstand sometimes why the United States uses technologyrestrictions against us and not the Warsaw Pact," he said.There are significant obstacles to overcome in promoting greaterweapons trade between the U.S. and France, Roger said. Currently,the U.S. only spends 1 percent of its defense budget abroad, withFrance only spending 4 percent outside the country. "We areslightly better than you are, but there's room for improvement inboth countries.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990U.S. `BACK TO THE FUTURE' IN PANAMAby Tony CapaccioAlthough resistance was stiffer than expected, Operation "JustCause"--the U.S. invasion of Panama--was a less difficultmilitary operation than it might have been. Sound planning andtactics honed by repeated dry runs apparently paid off in atleast two vital areas: communications and urban armor warfare,according to officials.The Panama operation made use of knowledge gained from a seriesof little known Joint Chiefs of Staff-run surprise exercisesdesigned to test the communication links between Washington andcommanders in the field.Analysts have said the U.S. invasion in Panama represents a peakat the military's future "low-intensity conflict" role in an eralargely devoid of East-West tension. But in an unnoticed irony,the U.S. carried out the Panamanian intervention with World WarII-era urban warfare techniques.Concerning communications, the task was made a little easierbecause Panama Defense Force (PDF) troops failed to useelectronic jamming devices to disrupt the extensive U.S. UHF, VHFand satellite communications (SATCOM) network, said a Pentagonofficial involved in the planning.But even if the PDF had the capability to shoot down satellites"we still could have communicated," the official said. He labeledSATCOM devices as the workhorse of Just Cause.And while at least 23 U.S. soldiers and several hundred PDFsoldiers and civilians were killed in fighting, the toll wouldhave been much higher had not light infantry and their armorcounterparts worked effectively in tandem, said Lt. Col. JamesGrazioplene, the commander of the invasion's main armor unit.The lessons of Panama are destined to be pored over and cited byArmy officials as a model of how the service will fight in futureThird World conflicts.The unit, the 3rd Battalion, 73rd Armor Regiment, is the nation'sonly readily deployable light armor unit. It is equipped with 54Vietnam-era Sheridan tanks, 12 of which were deployed in Panama.The unit since 1988 has been refining the arcane art of mobileurban warfare, said Grazioplene in an interview. But the traininghad a unique twist: "We had to go back and dust off field manualsfrom the Korean War," for tactical advice on how to fight withinfantry, he said.The unit also relied in part on a 1949 armor study conducted oncombined infantry-armor tactics used in the 1944 battle of theHuertgen Forest. The dearth of contemporary doctrine prompted theunit to begin crafting a new joint light armor/light infantrydoctrine, he said.By the time U.S. troops descended on Panama, they had a networkof SATCOM channels at their disposal, said the Pentagon official.The network allowed troops to communicate with their U.S. baseheadquarters, the Southern Command in Panama, and if need be, theNational Military Command Center at the Pentagon.Virtually every unit ranging from the Navy SEALS who landed earlyto snatch Gen. Manuel Noriega to the 7th Light Infantry Divisionsoldiers were equipped with SATCOM units.The channels were available because Pentagon communicationsexperts, including the Defense Communications Agency, were given"sufficient time" to do the technical work necessary to openthem, the official said."Just Cause" planners allowed for enough time to open adequateSATCOM channels because they had uncovered glitches during aseries of so-called "no-notice" communications exercisesconducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff since 1984, the officialsaid."What we the operations community did was look at the objective,which was to take out the PDF in the main, i.e. in Panama City,and then take out all places we said were nerve centers of thewhole thing," the official said.Although the PDF had electronic jammers, "we just didn't feelthey had the kind of sophisticated equipment," that could causegreat problems, the official said. "They could have interferedwith us but not for long," because U.S. troops were poised todestroy the sites if necessary, he said."The whole damn thing was pretty orderly," said the official ofthe communications procedures implemented for "Just Cause."Likewise, based at least on early field reports, Army armor andlight infantry appeared to work well together, Grazioplene said.The tactics employed on the streets of Panama City were standarddoctrine practiced in World War II and Korea, he said.There was no way last week to independently verify the Army'saccount. Attempts to interview soldiers who fought in Rangerunits in Panama were unsuccessful. The soldiers said the Army hadinstructed them not to talk to reporters.The tactics, glimpsed by millions of television viewers, weredesigned to use infantry to protect the lightly armored Sheridansfrom hand-held anti-tank weapons, such as the RPG-18, which thePDF was known to have. Unlike most tanks, the Sheridan, has verylight armor protection and shields itself through a combinationof speed and infantry tactics."We've being doing that for the past year," Grazioplene said ofthe tactics. "We've been revising ways to use tanks in tandemwith dismounted instruments (infantry) in small formations."Another concern was that the Sheridans might have had to battlePDF armored vehicles such as the V-150 and V-300. For thoseencounters, the Sheridans were armed with two Shillelagh antitankmissiles, he said. But the tanks did not engage any enemyvehicles in fire fights.Ironically for the 3rd Battalion, the Panama invasion took placein the middle of a debate within the Army over what vehicleshould replace the Sheridan. Among the candidates the Army iseyeing for the role is a version of the Marine Corps LightArmored Vehicle that was also deployed to Panama.In fact, one major meeting of general officers had been scheduledto discuss the issue in the Pentagon on Dec. 21 but it meetingwas abruptly canceled.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990HILL PANEL IRKED BY TIGHT-LIPPED FOUR-STARby David J. LynchMembers of a key congressional subcommittee last year blisteredthe commander of the U.S. Space Command for refusing to respondto detailed questions about a troubled $1.3 billion modernizationprogram in the nation's early warning command post, according toa recently declassified transcript of the hearing.Gen. John Piotrowski, the head of the Space Command, toldlawmakers they should ask Air Force procurement officials aboutthe programs, aimed at upgrading Cheyenne Mountain's antiquatedcomputer and communication gear. The mountain houses themilitary's main command post for receiving warning of a nuclearattack.Piotrowski's stance annoyed members of the House defenseappropriations subcommittee already upset over reports that theupgrade would be several years late and millions of dollars overbudget. The clash occured at a Feb. 9, 1989 hearing. Thecommittee recently released an excised transcript.At issue were the Communications System Segment Replacement(CSSR) and the Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC)modernization. According to the committee, SPADOC is $147 millionover budget and may be up to seven years late once installed.Officials have been unable to hook up the CSSR, parts of whichhave been delivered, because of incompatible wiring. It isexpected to be four years late.After Piotrowski, who will operate the new systems onceinstalled, repeatedly parried questions on their status, Rep.John Murtha (D-Pa.), the subcommittee chairman, exploded:"General, this is unacceptable...You just say everything is fine.You won't answer a question unless we absolutely identify what iswrong because you don't want to take a chance on telling ussomething that maybe we should know.""...I don't know what to say other than acquisition is not aCINC's responsibility," Piotrowski said. "Unified commanders arenot involved in the acquisition process. The services are."Earlier, Piotrowski had noted it could be illegal for him, as anoperational commander, to work directly with contractors.One month later, when top Air Force officials testified beforethe panel, the lawmakers' irritation was clear. "We did not getsatisfactory answers from Gen. Pietrowski," Murtha told the AirForce witnesses."We did not get what we considered to be informative answers whenwe made an effort to talk to the CINC," added McDade. "...Youcannot expect us to invest taxpayers' dollars in what appears tobe a tangled web. We need to find out what is going on."After responding to questions, John Welch, the assistantsecretary of the Air Force for acquisition, suggested thecommittee hold a separate four- to eight-hour session to discussthe Cheyenne Mountain programs.On May 16, Piotrowski reappeared before the committee,accompanied by Lt. Gen. Donald Kutyna, the comander of the AirForce Space Command, which oversees development of the newcomputer and communication gear.Kutyna said the Air Force had cracked down on the contractorsinvolved, GTE Corp. and Ford Aerospace Corp. "I have goneindividually to the contractors and told them they are introuble. I have leverage with those contractors becaue we havemany, many other contracts they are competing for," Kutyna said.Kutyna also said top Ford Aerospace officials had met with himand Piotrowski to discuss the SPADOC program. Ford also droppedTRW Inc. as its major subcontractor on the effort, a move the AirForce applauded. "Ford did not put their best people on thisproject. They have gotten rid of TRW--so I think we will havethese things in hand, but there will be problems that pop up,"Kutyna said."I appreciate what has happened since we met with Gen. Piotrowskilast time," Murtha said.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990MARINES WORK HILL ON OSPREY'S BEHALFby Eric RosenbergMarine Corps officials and their congressional allies have agreedupon a strategy to save the V-22 tiltrotor in the face of anexpected recommendation to kill the program by an independentstudy group, according to industry and  congressional sources.Under the plan, Congress would divert fiscal 1991 money earmarkedfor CH-53E and H-60 helicopter buys to the V-22, said sources. Infiscal 1992, when the Osprey will move from development to themore expensive production phase, the strategy calls for Congressto divert money from a service life extension program on the CH-46 helicopter to the V-22.More than $1 billion would be shifted to the Osprey, which hasconsiderable support on all four defense panels, particularly theHouse and Senate defense appropriations panels. The links betweenMarine officials and key lawmakers are close and extensive.Marine aviation chief Lt. Gen. Charles Pittman frequentlyconsults by telephone with Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), an ex-Marineand chairman of the defense appropriations panel, on Ospreystrategy, congressional sources said.The unusual plan, which circumvents a Pentagon edict to await theoutcome of the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) study, hasits roots in other than parochial congressional concerns. Theplan was hatched by lawmakers incensed by what they considered adouble-cross by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last month when hewithdrew unspent V-22 procurement money, said sources.For the Marines, the V-22 is the number one weapon priority inwhich they have already invested billions of dollars. Officialsare reluctant to concede the Osprey's demise, said sources.When members of the four congressional defense panels and top-level Pentagon officials sat down last fall to hammer out acompromise on controversial program terminations in the fiscal1990 budget, they agreed the think tank study would determine theOsprey's fate.IDA's cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA), isbeing conducted by the independent Institute for Defense Analysisin Alexandria, Va., and is due this spring. Congress asked for astudy examining all V-22 alternatives, including a variety ofexisting helicopters.The compromise agreement turned out to be the calm before thestorm. Citing fiscal responsibility, Deputy Defense SecretaryDonald Atwood last month withheld all unobligated fiscal 1989 V-22 long lead procurement funds--about $260 million--with theeffect of terminating all production contracts between Ospreyproducer Bell Helicopter Textron Inc./Boeing Co. and itssubcontractors."...[T]he Administration reached a firm decision not to procurethe V-22 Osprey aircraft. Given that decision, it seems fiscallyprudent to terminate the V-22 procurement contracts," accordingto an internal Pentagon memo written by Cheney assistant DavidAddington. His Nov. 30 memo served as the basis for Atwood'sDec. 1 decision, said congressional and industry sources."Cheney has lost a lot of friends on the Hill," said one staffer,echoing the sentiments of several others. "It'll be tough totrust him in the future."Osprey proponents on Capitol Hill cried foul. Without the long-lead money and without the subcontractors in place, the V-22'scost would jump nearly $1 billion, almost certainly ensuring thatthe IDA study will side with a helicopter to perform the mediumlift, troop-carrying missions, they claimed.Pentagon officials tried to ease tensions with congressionalOsprey supporters by asserting the Atwood move didn't forecloseIDA's options.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), whosupported Cheney's decision to terminate the program, concurred."Your decision to hold unobligated FY89 V-22 procurement funds inabeyance until further legislative action is taken will maintaincongressional options to make a V-22 production decision nextyear," Aspin wrote Atwood on Dec. 22.But an internal Pentagon memo suggests the Pentagon has nointention of procuring the V-22 even if the IDA study recommendsthe Osprey to perform the medium-lift and troop carryingmissions.In an internal Dec. 15 Pentagon memo from the director of landwarfare to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition JohnBetti: "The V-22 COEA requested by Congress will have `emergingresults' by April 90 with a final report out by the end of June.This effort, however, will not affect the SECDEF's decision sincethe affordability and priority issues for a new production startwill probably again prevail."The IDA study has become somewhat of a joke to V-22 supporters,who now believe backroom deal-making and bulldozing theopposition are the only ways to save their pet project. "We'reready for a fight, and it will mean a fist fight," said onePentagon V-22 proponent.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990ARMY, AIR FORCE MAP OUT NEW BATTLE PLANSby Tony CapaccioThe Army and Air Force last month agreed to a new blueprint onhow to fight in so-called Third World low intensity conflicts(LIC) that makes clear military options should be subordinate topolitical operations.But the document also stresses that should force be employed itis "vital" it be minimal to reduce casualties and propertylosses.The blueprint, approved Dec. 4 by respective service chiefs ofstaff Army Gen. Carl Vuono and Air Force Gen. Larry Welch,"explains the subtle yet critical differences between LIC andother conventional operations.""Military leaders have two distinct yet related sets ofresponsibilities in the LIC environment," said the document,formally called Field Manual 100-20. "First is their traditionalresponsibility to their military mission and their troops. But inaddition to simply capturing ground or destroying the enemy, theymust also exercise a constructive influence to achieve largerpolitical and psychological objectives," it said.Although many of the manual's arcane principles were played outby U.S. forces in Panama, one official stressed last week thatfew if any troops would have been familiar with its maxims. Theblueprint will not be formally printed until June. Defense Weekobtained a bootleg copy after Army and Air Force officialsrefused to release it.At least one principle critical to using troops in Third Worldbattles--exercising restraint in the use of force in urbansettings--was repeatedly practiced, said Army sources.According to the field manual: "Use of the minimum essentialforce to minimize the loss of life and destruction to property isvital. This requires detailed planning, coordination andcontrol."How closely that tenet was applied in Panama remains in question.Hundreds of Panamanian civilians were killed in the U.S. invasionand some neighborhoods were heavily damaged in the initialfighting.But Army officials last week also pointed to what they said wereexamples of restraint. Among them were the use of Air Force AC-130 gunships and Army AH-64 Apaches to attack targets thattraditionally would have required more indiscriminate artilleryfire.Army officials also highlighted three examples in which U.S.troops opted for minimal force to take out enemy troops."When you're trying to win hearts and minds its the thing youwant to do," said one official.An official pointed out that an 82nd Airborne Division sniperkilled with a single shot a Pamana Defense Forces (PDF) sniper inan adjacent building hundreds of yards away. An official pointedout that instead of the surgical shot, the sniper's lare couldhave been riddled with M-60 machine gun fire.In a second example, troops of the 193rd Infantry Brigade whoassaulted a nearby PDF building refrained from firing at onePanamanian monument--the large granite mausoleum of formerstrongman Gen. Omar Torrijos, which was situated directly in theline of attack on a golf course fairway. In dry runs of theassault, conducted in the days before the invasion, troops weredrilled to avoid an obstacle representing the mausoleum.And finally, although it was also situated in a location whereheavy fighting took place, a nativity scene in the courtyard ofManuel Noriega's Commandancia was unscratched even though thesurrounding area was pockmarked with bullet holes.The field manual also contained a marked departure from the ColdWar years when virtually every Third World conflict was cast byU.S. policymakers as Soviet-instigated. "The Soviets are notresponsible for all conflicts in the world," the document said.But, it reminded readers, "they can and do exploit otherwiseinternal conflicts to implement their global strategy." In fact,according to the document, "the threat to the United States inLIC is the exploitation of instability by groups opposed to U.S.goals."In addition, the field manual also highlighted the role ofspecial operations forces. Besides planning and conductinginsurgency and counterinsurgency, direct action, reconnaissanceand counterterrorism, commando troops "provide senior decisionmakers with options for discriminate engagement, precluding theneed to employ large, conventional combat formations."Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990MARINE AIR BOSS EYES OSPREY STUDYLt. Gen. Charles Pittman is the Marine Corps deputy chief ofstaff for aviation. After taking over as the service's topaviation planner in 1988, Pittman is presiding over what manyconsider the most dynamic period in Marine aviation history.Pittman was responsible for shepherding the controversial V-22Osprey through the Pentagon and Congress when Defense SecretaryDick Cheney tried to terminate the multi-billion dollar programlast year. Officials credit Pittman with helping convinceCongress to put the program back into the budget and withformulating internal Pentagon strategy to reinstate the tilt-rotor in the five-year plan.Much of Pittman's time is spent developing long-range plans tohelp make the Marines lighter and better equipped. As Marineaviation chief, he is responsible for ensuring the Marines haveplenty of modern aircraft into the next century--a high wire actat best given tight budgets and the relative low priority Marineprograms get with the Navy.Pittman was recently interviewed by Defense Week reporter EricRosenberg.DEFENSE WEEK: First, can you describe the Marine Corps air wingof the next century, what it will look like, what sorts ofaircraft and missiles you are looking toward?PITTMAN:  With peace breaking out all over the world, which weapplaud, assuming that continues, we would see a significantlydifferent requirement for most of the armed forces. However, forthe Marine Corps which has been involved in expeditionary forceswhich can handle a full spectrum of conflict, from low intensityconflict to general war, we won't see any major changes in ourphilosophy or where we want to go. We believe that we need aforce projection capability for the United States and that's whatwe try to be.As a Navy force we can be sea-based, we can be land-based, we goby air to get where we want to go. We can pre-position equipmenton MPSs [maritime prepositioning ships] that can be moved aroundthe world. The mission of the Marine Corps we don't see changingsignificantly. However, our equipment must be modernized as weenter the 21st century.So we would see such things as more VSTOL [vertical short takeoffand landing] aircraft. We're looking at an advanced short takeoffand vertical landing aircraft, an ASTOVL we call it, which willreplace all of our fighter and attack aircraft...If we have anASTOVL we'll be able to go anywhere. But we do need thesupersonic capability, if we want to have a fighter aircraft.This will also have the best characteristics for the attack role,which the AV-8B Harrier now performs. Early in the 21st century,let's say 2010 or shortly thereafter, we hope to have an ASTOVLfor these missions...This may or not be feasible given the budgetsituation of today...We just have to see how the budgets comeout and how much priority that has...DW:      You testified last spring on Capitol Hill...about thenext-generation aircraft the Marines are interested in. The A-12came up in the discussion. You said the Marines don't want it andwere not committed to it. It sounded as if the F/A-18 willperform that attack role in the near-term instead of the A-12.PITTMAN: Yes, that's what I said, and that's the way we see it atthis point in time. The A-12, of course, has not flown yet,although it's under development and is going very well. Webelieve that the A-12 for our particular mission wasn't quitesuitable. First of all, it is designed to be a stealthy aircraft,which we appreciate and would like. It's designed to handle long-range missions. We may not need to go that far, not that wecouldn't be assigned a mission like that. But basically, we buyour aircraft primarily to support our ground forces. Our groundforces hopefully will not be deployed that far away from ouraviation element. Certainly, if we have our ASTOVL aircraft wewon't have to worry about that.So the price to get that kind of range from the A-12 may be morethan you want to pay. We believe that the A-12 will beconsiderably more expensive than the F/A-18. Now, the F/A-18 thatI described in that testimony was the two-seat model, the "D"model. There are several concepts of that, one would be astraight "D" model which we are procuring at this time which hasnight attack, under the weather capability, nowhere near thecapability of the A-12 for long-range penetration or attack.However, what the F/A-18 does give us is the ability to operatejust as well under the weather and with much more speed andsurvivability in a close air support environment...DW:      Are you interested in the so-called Hornet 2000 concept, anadvanced F/A-18 with extended range? Do you need the extendedrange if you're fighting close in?PITTMAN: We're really interested in that. We would like to have alittle more range on the F/A-18. The Navy is particularlyinterested in extending the Hornet's range. One of theshortcomings of the F/A-18 is that it doesn't have the time-on-station or the ability to stay up with the rest of the forces.They've got to be refueled in the air or come back early...So wesupport the requirement for additional range because you canconvert range into time-on-station which is important to us inthe close air support or air patrol roles.DW:      Getting back to the Marine air wing of the future, what otheraircraft do you want in addition to ASTOVL?PITTMAN: It depends where you lay down in the 21st century. Rightnow given the current events, it looks like the Marine Corpswould have a mix of some kinds of helicopters. We're not surewhich. We're looking very carefully at what that might be. One ofthem, of course, would be the CH-53E which currently is inproduction, and we hope to continue that for the next severalyears as we fill out our heavy-lift forces. We may be buying morethan we anticipated to replace the V-22 capability, which now isout of the picture as far as we're concerned officially.The alternative that would be in that helicopter mix is somethingbeing reviewed by the secretary of defense and his study groupover at the Institute for Defense Analysis. We are doing our ownanalysis now, trying to get ahead of the game because we believewe have to get started right away if we're going to reduce forcelevels out in 1994-1995 timeframe. And if we're going to have anairframe by then, we must start development immediately andprocurement within a year or two. So we are looking at severalalternatives very hard.First is the Sikorsky Blackhawk, either the current model or thestretch model which will allow us to carry more Marinesinternally which is what we really need. That's the onlyshortcoming we've seen so far in the Blackhawk...We're alsolooking at we call the "Son of the CH-46," either aremanufactured CH-46 or some new aircraft as well, kind of likethe F-14D program...DW:      What's the timeframe for the Marine helicopter study?PITTMAN: We need to know where we want to go by early spring, andwe're getting a lot of cost estimates in right now. We're workingin conjunction with the IDA study group to make sure they aren'tstudying one thing and we're studying something else and we getsome divergent answer and present the secretary of defense withanother dilemma.I'm not trying to preempt them either. We've got to make sure ournumbers are in agreement or we know why we disagree.DW:      The IDA study you're talking about is the tiltrotoralternatives study Congress mandated this year.PITTMAN: It's the one that studies the V-22. And of course we'revery interested in that. There are groups within the Marine Corpsthat still believe the V-22 provided the least cost alternativeover time. Now, if you look at it per year in the near-term,obviously it will cost more because you're buying a brand newaircraft with a lot of capability. On the other hand, if you lookover the life cycle cost of things, it varies. That's what we'retrying to get a handle on for the secretary of defense. It mayturn out that we can't afford that kind of investment up fronteven if it saves us money.DW:      Secretary Cheney recently decided to reprogram unspentfiscal 1989 long lead V-22 funds. If cost is a majorconsideration in the IDA study, and you take away the long leadprocurement money, doesn't that have the effect of pushing costsup, effectively ruling out the possibility that IDA will concludethat the V-22 is the cheaper medium-lift alternative?PITTMAN: Of course, it's a concern. But then you have tounderstand the Department of Defense position. Secretary Cheneyhas said he's decided not to procure the V-22. It would be poorbusiness to hold on to the procurement money that would buy theaircraft he said he wasn't going to buy. He has said he willcontinue the R&D program, which he is doing. So I think he'sbetween a rock and a hard place at this particular point in time.On the other hand, the Congress was very specific in that theywanted to look at this again in the future and kind of hold thatmoney for that purpose. So you could say, yes, it worries me,certainly. If for some reason the secretary were to have enoughinformation to convince him to change his mind, then, yes it willcost more money [to procure Ospreys]. I think the $1.3 billionfigure in the papers is high...DW:      Cheney took away about $200 million in fiscal 1989advance procurement money. Can't Bell-Boeing put that toward theprogram themselves?PITTMAN: Well, I think the companies already have a lot atrisk...Putting that $200 million or $100 million for that matterof the corporations' money into the program with the hopes thatsomeone will change their mind is a hell of a gamble.DW:      Since the V-22 flight program has progressed, has therebeen interest from other nations to get on board the effort?PITTMAN: Yes, more from the commercial aspects than from thecombat aspects. They're all watching it. Nobody wants to help uspay the bill, so they are all waiting until we do the expensivepart...Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL PITTMAN, ContinuedDW:      Can you describe some of the goals in the Marine Air/GroundTask Force Master Plan?PITTMAN: The master plan is designed to look out to the 21stcentury and see what kind of force we want to have. There areseveral goals that we have in mind. We must lighten up. That'snot to be confused with the light Army divisions...We're lookingat lighter, more effective weapons, longer range weapons...We wantto lighten up the load of things that we have to bring with us.In addition to lightening up, we've got to be able to fight underall conditions, we've go to be able to fight in the night better.We're talking about night vision sighting, night targetingequipment. We've got to have laser range finders...We need afaster helicopter-type force, a tiltrotor force. I believe thetiltrotor will come if the V-22 is canceled. But we still needthe speed, range, the capability of a tiltrotor force if we'regoing to survive against modern weapons...DW:      So you are indeed looking post-V-22. Tiltrotor still isin your consciousness.PITTMAN: It's within the reach of mankind, and if it is we'regoing to go for it. Now, maybe not the United States first, maybesomebody else will lead. Someone will hire these engineers to putall this together and they'll build if for the Japanese or theGermans or somebody...It's got to go sooner or later...Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990PLANS TO ARM BASE WORKERS FLAWEDby Timothy McCuneAir Force plans to arm personnel at military bases in response toterrorist attacks or other emergencies are inadequate despite afour-year long effort to correct security problems, according toan internal audit.The Air Force Audit Agency report, completed in July, evaluatedthe U.S. Air Force War and Mobilization Plan, which includes ablueprint for base protection during emergencies. The report wasobtained under the Freedom of Information Act.The report found the service hadn't established policies orprocedures to arm base police personnel who normally don't carryguns. The service hadn't identified base personnel who could bearmed if there were an emergency, the report said. The reviewincluded installations in Germany, Spain, the Philippines, Koreaand the U.S."...[T]he Air Force had not established a standard overall policyfor training, equipping, and arming non-security police personnelwho are deployable or assigned to installations in potentiallyhostile areas," the report said."As a result, commanders may not have adequate numbers ofweapons-qualified personnel or weapons to protect and defendtheir installations," the report said.In addition, the contingency plans for the Air Force bases didn'tinclude how critical areas, such as communications centers, wouldbe protected by base personnel, the report said. The problem wasexacerbated because authority for arming base personnel is "fragmentedthroughout several regulations with no single authoritativesource to guide commanders in developing...programs," the reportsaid.These problems exist despite an announcement in August 1985 thatthe service's plans and operations office would develop thenecessary plans, the report said. A proposed policy was issued in1988, but has not been approved, the report said.The report warned that putting the proposed plan into effectmight take several years because of funding shortages.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990NAVY SHRPLY REJECTS DINGELL'S BAIL-OUT CHARGEby Eric RosenbergThe Navy late last month sharply rejected congressional chargesthe service paid up to a $90 million bail out to falteringshipbuilder Bath Iron Works Corp. to ensure the first DDG-51Arleigh Burke class destroyer would be built."To characterize the settlement of a justifiable contract changeas a `bailout' is at best misleading," Navy Secretary LawrenceGarrett said in a Dec. 22 letter to Rep. Charles Bennett(D-Fla.), the chairman of the House Armed Services seapowersubcommittee. Bennett released the letter four days later.The charges were leveled against the Navy in early December byRep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy andCommerce investigations subcommittee. Dingell said the first DDG-51-class ship under construction at Bath was at least 18 monthsbehind schedule because of significant changes to the design theNavy requested.Due to the cost-sharing arrangement between Bath and the service,which required the company to pay for much of the development,Bath was in serious financial trouble and threatened to shut downthe yard, Dingell said. As a result, the Navy paid the yardbetween $75 million and $90 million to continue work. Dingelllabeled the additional government money a "bailout.""We do not know the basis of the $75 million to $90 millionfigures quoted by Congressman Dingell," Garrett wrote."The Navy paid the shipyard an additional $34.7 million becausethe service requested changes to the design beyond the intent ofthe original contract," Garrett wrote. However, "the contractmodification did not turn a $41.4 million loss into a $11.4million profit," as Dingell alleged, the Navy secretary wrote.The Navy negotiated further contract adjustments with Bathbecause of the added requirement to reduce the radar crosssection of the 8,315 ton, all-steel ship, Garrett wrote. "Thisrisk sharing is consistent with current Navy policy for reducingcost risk to contractor for combatant lead ship construction," hewrote.The Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers will rely onthe complex Aegis anti-air warfare system to track and shoot downenemy targets. The destroyer program is valued at $33 billion.Bath is producing the first ship and Litton Industries/IngallsShipbuilding the second.Garrett's response was met with a rebuke from congressionalcritics. "It's a fact-free analysis," said one staffer. "It's allplatitudes about the ship and not much beyond that."A key point of contention between the Navy and Dingell is whetherthe ship's design can be manipulated to elude enemy radar. In aDecember letter to Bennett, Dingell said, "According to the radarexperts we have consulted, nothing can be done to reduce thisship's radar signature enough to make any practical difference inthe range at which it could be detected by an airborne radar."Said Garrett: "Congressman Dingell's radar experts areincorrect." Garrett didn't explain how the massive ship can beconstructed to avoid enemy radar. Much of the informationrelative to radar cross section is classified, he wrote.Though the delivery date has been rescheduled twice because of"unforseen design, engineering and production issues," Bath willdeliver the lead ship within the $1.2 billion cost goal and byFebruary 1991, Garrett wrote."The Navy is confident that these issues are behind us, and thatthe DDG-51 will deliver to its present schedule," he wrote.Meanwhile, Bennett, a longtime DDG-51 proponent, plans hearingson the issue Jan. 24.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990DIA COMPLAINED AFTER KRINGS LET PRESS SEE SOVIET PLANESBy David J. LynchA 1988 public display of Soviet aircraft acquired by the Pentagonfor U.S. weapons tests later drew vigorous complaints fromintelligence officials worried the publicity would scare offpotential sources of East Bloc arms.In September 1988, several Soviet fighters and helicopters alongwith some Chinese radar gear were exercised as the MobileIntegrated Threat Test (MITT) at Kirtland air base in New Mexico.In a novel approach, the Pentagon obtained the Soviet equipmentthrough a private company called C3P Inc., which had purchasedthem on the open market.U.S. intelligence agencies acquire similar gear throughclandestine sources. But MITT's organizer, Jack Krings, thendirector of operational testing for the Pentagon, said thatequipment is kept under wraps and is unavailable for weaponstests.After the 1988 demonstration, Defense Intelligence Agencyofficials complained to officials in Krings' office and thePentagon public affairs shop that press reports had violatedsecurity rules and spooked potential sources, according torecently declassified congressional testimony."There was controversy...The DIA people went through theoverhead," said a former Pentagon official.In an April 26, 1989 closed door appearance, Krings was grilledby the House defense appropriations subcommittee on whether thepress coverage had been OK'd by top Pentagon officials. Thecommittee recently released an edited transcript of the hearing.Krings defended the program, saying it had been approved by thesecretary of defense.Lawmakers cited the DIA objections to an `Aviation Week' articleabout the program to acquire on the open market outdated Sovietfighters and choppers.According to several internal memos cited by Rep. Bob Livingston(R-La.), Pentagon officials felt Krings had endangered futureclandestine acquisitions. "The public commentary concerningForeign Commercial Purchasing serves to cause disruption andtermination of intelligence sources...The publicity has alsocaused claimed diminished availability with corresponding priceincreases," the memo said.One Defense Intelligence Agency official called Carl Pflock, anaide to Krings, to complain. "I informed Mr. Pflock that it wasone of the most irresponsible articles I had seen...I calledeveryone who could remotely have cleared the article. There wereno admissions," said a second memo. And a Pentagon public affairsofficial noted receipt of "an absolutely irate call from DIA inthe wake of the Aviation Week piece."But documents Krings provided for the hearing record, includingan official Pentagon "blue-top" press release, indicated theevent had been coordinated through official channels.In fact, MITT had been cleared at the highest levels of thePentagon, according to Krings. In a telephone interview lastweek, he said he had personally discussed the project with then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and his deputy William TaftIV. "There's no question it was all totally approved," Kringssaid.The publicity did prompt a change in the status of the Pentagon'scontracts with C3P. An April 3, 1989 Pentagon inspector generalreport found the security classification of the firm's contractshad been downgraded after the MITT unveiling. "The rationale forthe action was the extensive press coverage authorized by[Krings]. The government had not disclosed nor exposed thesources of its purchases, so there was no reason for keep thecontracts classified," the report said. The report also notedthat Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a frequent Krings critic,wrote the IG expressing concern about the publicity.Krings said some intelligence officials objected to MITT becausethe commercial purchasing program threatened their monopoly onSoviet equipment. "What we were finding out was you could go outand buy commercially what they were getting using clandestinemeans," Krings said. The commercial buys also were cheaper, headded.Some subcommittee members criticized the purchase of outdatedSoviet fighters, including MiG-15s. But Krings said evenantiquated Soviet equipment was valuable to the test program.First, such gear was relatively cheap compared to the cost ofmodifying old U.S. planes to serve as test targets. (A MiG-21could be bought for $500,000. Modifying an F-4 cost $2 million,Krings said.)And some older Soviet systems, particularly communicationssystems, have a "unique resistance to sophisticated" U.S. systemsthat should be tested before turning up in combat, he added.Krings also said there is a profit motive behind some of theopposition to the open market purchases. On some classified testprograms, especially involving simulators, he said there islittle competition and relatively high profits for a few firms.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990WHISTLEBLOWER'S SUB CHARGES `WITHOUT BASIS'by Tony CapaccioThe Pentagon inspector general has concluded allegations from aformer Navy electronics technician who charged serious safetyproblems with several SSN 688-class submarines "are withoutbasis."The investigation focused on allegations by former Navytechnician Joseph Richards of Lyme, Conn., that sonar andelectronic warfare equipment towed behind one of the Los Angeles-class subs could foul the ship's propeller.Richards also contended he was fired from his Navy job at theSupervisor of Shipbuilding (SUPSHIP), Groton, Conn., afterpointing out the potential problems.Richards fingered twin towed array cables of passive sonarequipment that are reeled out by a submarine from its stern, muchlike a fishing line, and retrieved through an intricate system ofcurved stowage tubes.Richards claimed the internal diameter of the stowage tubes on atleast 11 SSN-688s made by the Electric Boat Division of theGeneral Dynamics Corp. was too narrow and could jam the arrayduring retrieval operations, possibly fouling the cable in thesubmarine's propeller.But the investigation, requested by Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), failed to substantiate either claim. "We concluded thatMr. Richards' allegation of serious technical and safety problemsin SSN-688 class submarine towed array handling systems installedon board submarines built by Electric Boat are without basis,"the Dec. 15 report said.A Boxer aide said the report "spoke for itself."Neither could the inspector general prove Richards' firing couldbe linked to his complaints. Richards was fired forinsubordination at about the same time he registered the safetycomplaints.But the IG concluded, "Mr. Richards did not suffer reprisal. Wefound no genuine nexus between Mr. Richards' disclosures and hisreprimand and subsequent removal from the federal service."Richards, who has not found full-time work since his 1988 firing,last week called the report a "complete whitewash." Although hehad not yet read the entire report by press time, Richards said:"Based on my knowledge of the IG, it's a white wash. The Navy hasnot taken safety seriously. They'll lose a 688 submarine."Richards said the Navy lieutenant commander in charge ofinvestigating his safety allegations only met with him onceduring the five-month probe. "The lieutenant commander wants tobe a commander," Richards said. "He didn't want to take on theNavy."But the IG's conclusion about the alleged safety problems werebased on a review of ten years of incident, or casualty, reportsand seven years worth of submarine maintenance records.Navy records indicated that although Electric Boat didmanufacture some stowage tubes that had narrower diameters thanrequired, "all delivered submarines have met the acceptancecriteria in use," the report said.While noting that over the last decade one SSN-688 submarineexperienced a "serious jamming" of a towed array, the report said"no serious systemic problem with jammed arrays exists." Threeother minor problems reported "do not constitute a trend," thereport said,Richards alleged that a deployed array could tangle in asubmarine's propeller if it jammed while being retrieved during arisky emergency maneuver called a "crashback."The IG report, however, dismissed that notion: "Were an array orcable to come into contact with a turning propeller, it would beeasily severed. Submarine propellers are turned with a powerequivalent to several tens of thousands of horsepower. Incomparison with this power, the breaking strength of towed arraysand cables is negligible."Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990WAIVER FIX SEEN NEEDEDby Timothy McCuneAir Force officials who sign off on changes to contracts whenweapons systems fail to meet specifications often don't requirecompanies to compensate the service for the deficiencies,according to a service investigation.Service officials often failed to arrange for compensation forthese waivers and deviations even though "equitable pricereduction or other consideration," is required by federalregulation, according to an Air Force Audit Agency reviewcompleted in April. The report of the investigation was recentlyreleased to Defense Week under the Freedom of Information Act.The Air Force Systems Command each year approves more than 1,000major waivers and deviations on major weapons systems, the reportsaid. The terms refer to variations from contract specificationsthat must be approved by government program officers. Waivers areapprovals after items are manufactured, and deviations areapprovals before items are built.The investigation also found that Air Force procedures did notensure contractors completed corrective actions included inwaiver and deviation agreements.In 54 cases of waivers or deviations included in the review theagency found that in 17 cases--35 percent of the sample--the AirForce didn't receive money contractors should have paid becauseof substandard performance.This happened because program offices didn't perform anassessment of the contracts, or only did a "minimal review" in 12of the cases included in the investigation, the report said.In one example, a contracting office withheld $5.6 million afterapproving two waivers. The audit agency criticized the programoffice for releasing all of the money after the contractor tookcorrective action even though the government had spent $3.1million to deal with the deficiencies."...[P]rocedures for reviewing, determining, and obtainingequitable consideration for major waivers and deviations were notadequately and consistently applied," the report said.The Air Force often has to approve waivers and deviations toweapons systems to avoid disrupting the program schedules.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990TROUBLES MAKE CUTS LIKELY FOR SQQ-89Iby Eric RosenbergNavy officials are considering significant reductions in a majorantisubmarine warfare program because of its high cost andtechnical problems, according to congressional and Pentagonsources.One of the Navy's planned front-line defenses against enemy subs,the SQQ-89I, is in for deep cuts when the Pentagon's top-levelprogram review panel, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB),assesses the program in April, said congressional and Pentagonsources.The SQQ-89I is a derivative of the SQQ-89 currently in service.The systems process data from towed sonar arrays, hull-mountedsonars and aircraft sensors. Two contractor teams--one led byGeneral Electric Co. and another led by Westinghouse Corp.--aredeveloping competing SQQ-89I designs. The SQQ-89I is one of theNavy's most secret programs.The full-scale development review was set for this past fall, butDAB members delayed it until Navy planners could put together amore realistic plan that took into account technology setbacksand cuts in Navy force structure, according to Pentagonofficials.The program's survival is threatened by ever-shrinking Navy budgetsas well as technology snags that could lead to a possible three-to five-year slip in the delivery of the first system to Navyships, according to a congressional staffer.Originally, the Navy wanted to put the SQQ-89I on several typesof Navy warships, including Aegis ships, Perry-class frigates,and other vessels carrying the basic SQQ-89 system. Now itappears that the Navy will drop the frigates and others fromtheir ambitious procurement plans, said sources."We want to make sure we have the right program to execute," saidone Pentagon official. "We're looking at several different waysof doing things...we're in the process of restructuring," thesource said.GE had no comment by press time. Westinghouse spokesman JamesReinhard said he was not aware of any problems with the program.In a written response to queries, the Navy said "everything is onschedule" with the SQQ-89I.If the effort is scaled back, the entire program may be injeopardy, said Pentagon and industry sources. It could be morecost-effective to upgrade the existing GE manufactured SQQ-89sthan to sink money into the improved version, said sources."It's always an option to cancel the program, but it isn'tlikely," said one Pentagon official familiar with the program.The Navy needs the program to help combat the new generation ofquiet Soviet attack submarines, said sources.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990ARMY SUFFERS TRIM IN FINAL BUDGETby Tony CapaccioPentagon officials have approved a $75.8 billion budget for theArmy in fiscal year 1991 which represents about a $7 billion cutfrom the service's original request, according to Pentagonsources.The Pentagon won't formally release the budget for several weeksand Army spokesmen have repeatedly declined to discuss budgetfigures.About $4 billion was cut from individual programs. Army budgetwriters also assumed savings of an additional $2.6 billion fromreforms associated with the Defense Management Review, accordingto service sources. The budget as approved December 15th cuts10,000 civilians and 40,000 active duty soldiers.Only one major system was killed in the 1991 budget, the NATOcooperative program to produce a 155mm anti-armor, fire-and-forget artillery shell called the autonomous precision guidedmunition (APGM). The United States led an eight-nation effort todevelop the weapon, which was in the midst of a three-yearfeasibility phase.A similar NATO cooperative program to build a terminally guidedwarhead for the Multiple Launch Rocket System escaped the fiscal1991 budget axe when Pentagon officials reversed a decision todelete the program's fiscal 1990-1992 money.The 1991 budget reduced the Army's tank program request by $522.3million and eliminated a Marine Corps purchase of 255 M1A1 tanks.But the Army will receive $256 million to build 163 M1A1 and 62second generation M1A2 tanks before closing down its two tankproduction plants.Among the smaller programs trimmed in the budget was the MK-19grenade launcher, a weapon once described as a cornerstone of21st century Army small arms but which instead has been plaguedby quality control problems at the SACO Defense Inc. plant whereit is produced.The Army offered to kill the MK-19 program and save $39 million,but was overruled by Pentagon officials who decided to bankroll4,500 of the weapons instead of the 5,001 the Army once said itrequired.One of the few winners in the Army budget was the Pentagon'santi-satellite weapon.

Sawyer Air Force Base's V.I.P. quarters. Among theamenities: 24-karat gold-plated bathroom fixtures and custom-carved oak and brass doors.Those aren't the usual digs at U.S. military bases. As a result,the expense--particularly the $3,000 tab for the toilet trinkets--caught the eye of congressional watchdogs. In a recentlyreleased House Armed Services Committee hearing transcript, theAir Force was asked to justify the lavish 1988 rehab at Sawyer inlight of cuts in flying hours for service pilots."While we cannot justify some of the expenditures, we view thisas an isolated incident and not indicative of the Air Force wayof conducting business," the Air Force wrote the committee."...The project could have been more effectively and economicallymanaged."Capt. Paul Bicking, a base spokesman, said officials wanted gold-or brass-colored fixtures to replace green chrome accoutrements.The official who approved the purchase of the gold fixturesselected them from a catalog without consulting a price list, hesaid. "They found one that looked right. It turned out to be 24-karat gold," Bicking said.Base officials have instituted new policies to prevent arecurrence of the "administrative error" that led to the mini-scandal, Bicking said.No word on whether the V.I.P. bathroom was equipped with one ofthose $6,000 toilet seats.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990GAG ME:The Navy can't take just a little dissension. It seems quite afew service officials haven't been toeing the Navy party linewhen it comes to dealing with Congress. And what with the 1991budget about to be unveiled, and all the expected cuts andcontroversy contained therein, top-level Navy swabbies are hopingto ensure that the monolith is well in place.Head swabbie and Chief of Naval Operations, Carlisle Trostrecently dispatched an "Administrative Message," a.k.a. gagorder, to Navy flag officers and unit commanders."As available funding among programs becomes more intense, it isabsolutely critical that the department speak with a single voicewhen communicating with Congress," the December order said. "Inthis time of austere budgets, it is more important than ever thatwe preserve our credibility with Congress. This can only beaccomplished if our representations of Navy policy are accurateand consistent," the CNO wrote.From now on, if a Navy official is contacted directly by astaffer or lawmaker, the service official can respond only if thequestion is of "a nonpolicy nature." Otherwise, all congressionalrequests for info must be routed through the Navy comptroller oroffice of legislative affairs, Trost tells his underlings.But the CNO wants everyone to know the order isn't meant torestrict the flow of information to the legislative branch. AsNixon said, we could do that, but it would be wrong."This guidance should not be construed to interfere with, orlimit, the right of department personnel to communicate in theirindividual capacity with members of Congress to the extent suchcommunication is protected by law or regulation," Trost wrote.Where is George Orwell when you need him?Back to Headline List CopyrightDEFENSE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990MOVIN' ON:After four years, the Arms Control Association is losing JamesRubin, its assistant director.

Troops fanned out to search localvillages and recovered 231 Russian AK-47 assault rifles (andChinese AK-56 copies), 17,000 rounds of ammunition, tenrocket launchers, 80 anti-tank rockets, eight 9mm pistolswith holsters, manuals, and hundreds of rifle cleaning kits.There are radical guerrilla groups in several surroundingareas, but none are known to operate in Purulia.

Thecrates were addressed to the commander of a Bangladeshimilitary base across the border, but this was thought to bea deception effort. Curiously, India's air defense radarsystem was not operating on the night of the air drop, andthe Indian government ordered a review of air security.     Indian fighters forced an An-26 air transportregistered in Hong Kong with a crew of five Latvians and oneBriton to land in Bombay on 23 Dec (after Indianintelligence identified it).

Undertakeevery mission with enthusiasm.  *  Communicate with soldiers. This includes developing theskills to tell soldiers what is expected of them andlearning to listen to what soldiers are telling you. Readingbody language to determine if the soldier actuallyunderstands and will perform the task he says he understandsand will perform is a key tool.  *  Build cohesive teams. It is easier to control a groupof teams trained to work together than to control a horde ofindividuals. Teams must be built horizontally so that teammembers can take care of each other and solve many smallproblems without bothering their commanders. But teams mustalso be built vertically so that they trust their commandersand believe they will take care of and support them.  *  Provide purpose and direction by first creating avision of what the unit is to be, then by establishing goalsthat will bring about that vision. A series of objectivesmust be established leading the unit to each goal.Back to Headline List CopyrightFOR YOUR EYES ONLY via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996O'GRADY RESCUE WAS ONE MISSILE AWAY FROM DISASTERIF "JOINTNESS" IS GOING TO WORK,IT NEEDS TRAINING NOT LIP SERVICE     According to an analysis in Armed Forces JournalInternational, the Marine effort to rescue downed pilotScott O'Grady was not performed with the best equipment forthe mission and the personnel did not have the best trainingavailable. Some key points:  *  The CH-53E helicopters used for over-water rescue wereinadequate to the mission over Bosnia because their flaresystems could only distract the oldest versions of the SA-7.(Fortunately, the two missiles fired at the rescue aircraftwere of this ancient type.) The Air Force MH-60K Pave Hawkrescue helicopters have more extensive jamming and decoysystems and could have evaded shots by SA-16s or Stingers.If there had been one modern shoulder-fired missile alongthe flight path, the US would have been dealing with thedeath or capture of 30 Marines. The MH-60K is fitted withjungle-penetrating rescue gear that the CH-53E (expected tooperate over the ocean) does not have.  *  The rescue force could have been fitted with RangerBody Armor able to stop 7.62mm AK47 rounds. Instead, theywore flak jackets able to stop only grenade fragments. Oneconcealed Serbian rifleman willing to take his chances withthe Cobras could have caused many casualties with one burst.  *  The Marines had night vision devices in case the rescuelasted into the hours of darkness, but did not have nightweapons sights. This equipment is in the US inventory but isnot issued to rescue teams.  *  The Marines on the rescue team could have been issuedTactical Load-Bearing Vests which double as a rescueharness, allowing a few soldiers left behind to be quicklyrescued by dropping them a rope. Instead, they relied onbeing dropped rescue harnesses they would have had to taketime to put on before they could be lifted out.  *  The Army insists on training at least one man in ten(and strives to do better than that) in emergency medicalprocedures that could save the life of a gravely-woundedman. The Marines do not have a parallel training program andrely on the one medic in every 40-man platoon, although allMarines (indeed all US service personnel) get at leastrudimentary first aid training.  *  The Marine rescue team relied on stretchers to carrywounded men (these were not actually needed) instead of moreefficient collapsible litters used by the Army SpecialForces.  *  Few if any Marines (other than pilots) take theSurvival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape class taught atFort Bragg, NC. Army and Air Force rescue teams are giventhis training. (The Marines assume that their Force Recontraining adequately covers this specialized subject, andcould be partly right.)     [The O'Grady rescue might be regarded as the finalendorsement -- or condemnation -- of the concept of"jointness". The Marine unit was given pilot rescue as anadditional duty because there were not enough specializedAir Force rescue units in the theater, clearly what"jointness" is all about. The Marines had never beenprovided the specialized equipment, aircraft, and trainingfor the rescue mission, and the fact that it worked was dueas much to their attempts to make up this training on theirown as it was to their good fortune in the actual event.Jointness is going to require dollars for tools andtraining, not just lip service, if it is going to work.]Back to Headline List CopyrightFOR YOUR EYES ONLY via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996MILITARY SPACE: TITAN-4, ISRAELI ASTRONAUTS, SKIPPER     A TITAN-4 booster carried a spy satellite fromVandenburg into a polar orbit on 5 Dec.

TheArmy needs to train for gunnery to 3,000m and to train oneor two "sniper tanks" per company to shoot accurately to4,000m.     IRAN has refitted some Iraqi T-55s captured during the1980-88 war as Safir-74 (Messenger of God 74) tanks with"major improvements in engine power, transmission system,firepower, and an internal fire extinguisher".     LAV-105: The US Marines have finally given up trying tobuy 150 LAV-105 tank destroyer/assault guns, but didcomplete the development objectives of the program.

The government said thatthe stronger communist delegation would not cause changes inpolicy. (No major parties would ally with the communists.)Thirty-nine parties (which won a total of 50.3% of the vote)had failed to meet the threshold of 5% to win seats on the"party list" half of parliament, but many of them won a fewseats in local constituencies. [The parliamentary electionswere, in the final analysis, of little real importance.Everyone was maneuvering for the decisive presidentialelections in June.] NATO said the Russian elections wouldnot affect its expansion plans.     Chechnya: Russian heavy artillery and Grad missilelaunchers pounded Gudermes, the second-largest city inChechnya, which had been seized by rebels a week earlier.[Russian troops had repeatedly announced that the city hadbeen cleared, but apparently managed to discover more rebelseach time.]  *  20 Dec: Rutskoi and Lebed charged that the electioncommission had conspired to keep their parties from scoring5% of the vote.     Chechnya: Refugees from Gudermes said the town had beensubjected to the worst shelling in a year of war. There washand-to-hand fighting in the streets. Rebel commander AkhmedZakayev told Russian television that the Russian guns androckets had destroyed half of the town but he planned tohold the city.     Ukraine and the G7 nations signed a $2.3 billion dealto close the Chernobyl reactor by the year 2000.     Belarussian President Lukashenko named Valentin Agoletsto head the Interior (police) Ministry and VladimirMatskevich to head the National Security Service(intelligence).  *  21 Dec: Shipyard workers in Polyarny would not allow anuclear submarine they had just repaired leave because thegovernment had not paid them since August.     Aslan Maskhadov, overall military commander of theChechen rebel forces, ordered his troops out of Gudermes tospare further civilian casualties and damage to thebuildings. About 150 soldiers had been killed and 150 morewounded in a week of fighting. Other rebels capturedAchkhoi-Martin.  *  22 Dec: Chechen rebels still held key buildings inGudermes. Russian troops moved in to besiege the town,holding off on a full-scale assault to avoid causing massivecivilian casualties.  *  23 Dec: Chechnya: Russian troops recaptured theGudermes train station, where 70 Russian security troops hadbeen under siege.  *  24 Dec:  Russian troops secured Gudermes.     Moldova: The rebellious ethnic-Russian Dnestr regionheld its own parliamentary elections in defiance of theMoldovan government. In a referendum, 82% voted to declarethe Dnestr Republic a sovereign and independent state andapply for CIS membership separately from Moldova.     Tadjikhistan: Russian border guards killed 65 Tajikrebels trying to infiltrate the border from Afghanistan.     Kirghizstan held the first multi-party presidentialelections in its history. President Akayev won easily (71%)over two rival candidates. International observers said thevote had been fair but questioned the exclusion of threestronger opposition candidates on technicalities.  *  25 Dec: Civilians began moving back into Gudermes.  *  26 Dec: Yeltsin left the sanatorium for his countryhome. His first act was to create a new Council on ForeignPolicy which will report directly and only to him and not toparliament.     Doku Zavgayev, the puppet Russian governor of Chechnya,said the election had given him a mandate to make peace.Russia denied that General Shkirko had said that 267civilians had been killed in Gudermes.  *  27 Dec: Border guards commander Andrei Nikolayev saidhe needed more money to seal the borders against drugsmugglers, arms merchants, and trespassers. He received lessthan half of the $2.6 million he asked for.  *  28 Dec: There was furious maneuvering by presidentialcandidates. None of the top candidates can hope for 50% ofthe first ballot, forcing a run-off. [The problem is thatthree factions -- communist, nationalist, andreformist -- will be fighting for the two places on therun-off ballot.]     Chechnya: Rebel and Russian troops clashed atAchkhoi-Martin.  *  29 Dec: Zhirinovsky demanded three cabinet posts andthe speakership of the Duma as his price to support theYeltsin government.

Due to a new radarsystem, the airport was fully operational despite snow andfog. Troops of the 3/325 Parachute Battalion were deployedaround the airfield. [The 1st US Brigade is to be deployedin Posavina-Brcko-Gradacac. The 2nd US Brigade will deployin Zvornik-Olovo-Tuzla. The Russians will cover east ofBrcko and Zvornik. Most troops will arrive by Route Arizona,Orasje-Loncari-Cerik-Tuzla. US supplies will come in byRoute Michigan from Samac and Gradacac to Tuzla.] The USArmy pontoon bridge over the Sava was still not complete,and seven trainloads of US Army equipment were clustered atthe crossing area. British LtGen Sir Michael Walker arrivedin Sarajevo to command the NATO Rapid Reaction Corps, theground component of IFOR. British LtGen Rupert Smith,commander of the UN forces, left Sarajevo the next day. TheUS sharply rebuked Belgrade for suggesting that the Moslemsslaughtered at Srebrenica had been murdered by other Moslemfactions and said it would block Belgrade's attempts torejoin the UN until it cooperated with the investigation.Belgrade authorized NATO to cross its territory to supportthe peacekeeping operation. A spokesman for UNSG Ghali saidthat the UN troops in Bosnia were not sent there to stop awar but were now being blamed for a lack of peace. The OSCEselected US diplomat Robert Frowick to head the civilianaspects of the Dayton Accords. [This appointment was forcedthrough by the US over the opposition of France, whichdemanded that the job go to a European.] US envoy Holbookeacknowledged that US troops might have to disarm BosnianSerb units by force.     Montenegro said it would not recognize Croatia until itgave up the Prevlaka Peninsula. [Montenegro expects toeventually absorb the southeastern Bosnian Serbs, and wantsPrevlaka.]  *  20 Dec: NATO took control of the Bosnian peacekeepingmission from the UN. Many troops that had been on duty withthe UN transferred to NATO command, repainting theirvehicles and exchanging white or blue UN headgear for greencaps and helmets. To enforce its status, NATO begandismantling roadblocks and moving troops into areas thewarring factions had prohibited the UN from entering. USMajor General Nash (commander, 1st Armored Division) droveto meet Brigadier General O'Neal (head of his supply lines)on a road that the Serbs had blocked for years. (Nash wasescorted by a Danish tank platoon.) Nash met with BosnianSerb General Simic and Bosnian (Moslem) 2nd Corps CommanderBrigadier General Sead Delic at different times. An armoredBritish patrol (30 vehicles of the Light Dragoons) bulldozedaside a Serbian roadblock near Krupa and headed for BanjaLuka. US helicopter pilots were warned the Islamic and otherspies in Hungary would be watching their operations. Serbsin Sarajevo declared the NATO troops to be an army ofoccupation.     The UN Security Council told UNSG Ghali to assemble apeacekeeping force "able to defense itself" for EasternSlavonia and named US diplomat Jacques Klein (a MajorGeneral in the Air Force Reserve) to head it.  *  21 Dec: The UN Security Council demanded that the Serbsallow international investigators access to all grave sitesand prisoners in their territory. The Security Council alsoapproved a 1,700-man international police force for Bosniawhich will be used to recruit and train a new local policeforce. The US held talks with Turkey on setting up atraining program for the Bosnian (Moslem) Army. A Brigade ofthe Russian 98th Parachute Division under General AlexanderBespalov was in final training at Kostroma. Theinternational donors conference came up with $500 million tostart the rebuilding process in Bosnia. IFOR leased a hotelin Ilidza from the Serbs to use as the ground forceheadquarters. The Moslem government complained that IFORshould have leased the building from it rather than theSerbs, but IFOR said that as the Serbs presently controlledIlidza there was no real option but to lease it from them.NATO shut down Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia. The OSCEnamed Swiss diplomat Gret Haller as human rights envoy.Russian General Staskov met with Bosnian Serb General Mladicin Pale. [This was disturbing. Staskov is technically partof IFOR, which is technically not supposed to meet withindicted war criminals.]  *  22 Dec: The Moslem government formally ended the stateof war. The Moslem government issued a statement promisingsafety for the Sarajevan Serbs, but they remained skepticalof coming under Moslem control. Many continued digging upgraveyards to move the remains to Serbian-held areas to theeast. Sarajevan Serb leaders were actually blocking roadsand stalling permits to keep people from leaving the city.President Clinton and Senator Dole maneuvered over who wouldvisit the troops in Bosnia and when. (Both wanted to go assoon as possible, but the Army wants to delay this forweeks.) US troops went on alert when no one told them it wasthe day for the Danish tank unit's target practice. Unknowngunmen fired at two NATO aircraft involved in aidoperations.     UNSG Ghali criticized Croatia for doing too little tostop the killing of Krajina Serb civilians and the arson oftheir homes after the Croats overran the area last fall.Ghali particularly noted that Croat troops did not burySerbian dead reported by UN inspection teams and had notturned over registrations for 750 new graves. The SecurityCouncil demanded that Croatia drop its 27 Dec deadline forKrajina Serbs to return to the area to reclaim theirproperty.  *  23 Dec: British Light Dragoons were manning an outpostnear Banja Luka and said they had been welcomed by theSerbs.  *  24 Dec: Unable to get the pontoon bridge built acrossthe Sava (which was in full flood and wider than expected),US Army engineers used some of the pontoons to set up aferry to move a few vehicles across the river each day. TwoBritish soldiers were slightly wounded by a land mine.Moslem and Serb troops gave up their most exposed positionsin Sarajevo. Celebratory firing by Bosnians greeted peaceand the Christmas holidays. Serb and Moslem units exchanged200 prisoners. The first US combat helicopters (threeApaches and five Blackhawks) flew from Hungary into Tuzla.  *  25 Dec: Sarajevo held the first peaceful Christmassince 1992 as the Serbs and Moslems continued moving out offrontline positions. US Navy SEAL frogmen checked thebridging site on the Sava River for obstacles. A Britishsoldier committed suicide in Sarajevo. Bosnian Croat gunnersfired on a British helicopter near Jajce; it was not hit.This was the fifth such incident, and NATO said that suchfire was "undisciplined and unacceptable". A US helicoptermade an emergency landing in Serb territory due totransmission problems; it was recovered without incident.  *  26 Dec: NATO reported no armed resistance to itsmission or its "go anywhere" mandate. The ferry carried sixBradley scout vehicles of the 1/1 Cavalry into Bosnia, thefirst armor to cross the Sava. Admiral Smith met BosnianSerb parliamentary president Momcilo Krajisnik in Pale. TheSerbs said they wanted to delay the handover of Sarajevosuburbs to the Moslems; Admiral Smith (allowed by theaccords to grant such a delay) said a polite "no" butindicated he might review the situation later if there wasgood reason to. (The Moslems quickly expressed "deepdisappointment" with this answer.) US helicopters noted thatthey were being "painted" by Hungarian air defense (not firecontrol) radars when flying over Hungary and Croatia; thiswas not regarded as a problem.  *  27 Dec: The Serbs and Moslems had pulled back fromtheir front line position in Sarajevo. A platoon of Bradleyfighting vehicles was manning "Checkpoint Assassin" fivemiles south of the Sava. General Nash held a meeting withlocal Serb, Croat, and Moslem commanders at Porebrice toestablish rules and convince them to start removing mines.The US agreed to send two artillery-locating radar sets intoSarajevo to replace five Dutch and British radars beingmoved west. In a month, French radars will replace theAmericans (two French radars are there now). Helicopters hadto rescue French troops at Mostar after a dam collapsed andflooded their camp. Spanish troops completed a patrolthrough Croat, Serb, and Moslem territory around Mostar,entering areas previously banned to UN forces.  *  28 Dec: The rising Sava River flooded out the US Armycamp north of the bridging site. The Army took over thelocal ferry, shutting down civilian traffic across theriver. A detachment of US troops landed in Belgrade anddrove (in trucks and humvees) to Tuzla across the DrinaRiver bridge without incident. [These were the first NATOtroops to ever enter Serbia.] The Serbs complained thatmost of the reconstruction aid was going into Moslem andCroat areas. Bad weather stopped Italian troops fromdeploying to Bosnia. The US suspended its sanctions onSerbia and Montenegro.  *  29 Dec: The Army sent heavy Chinook helicopters tocarry pontoons into the middle of the Sava River, speedingup the bridge-building process. President Clinton arrangedto visit Bosnia in early January. A French plane landed inMostar, the first plane to land there since 1992.     Despite UN warnings, NATO commander Joulwan ruled outsending US troops into Eastern Slavonia, saying his forceswere totally committed with the Bosnia mission and he hadnone to spare for Croatia.  *  30 Dec: US Army Specialist Martin John Begosh becamethe first US casualty when his humvee drove over a mine; hesurvived with minor injuries. [The patrol thought it wasmoving up a main road, but quickly found the road overgrownwith brush, indicating no one had used it in years. The menon the patrol admitted that this should have been enough towarn them to turn back.] Ukraine made a last-minute decisionto keep its 550 troops in Bosnia at its own expense in orderto enhance its international prestige. Several of Karadzic'sclose political allies resigned from the Bosnian Serbparliament as he steadily lost his grip on power. US Navytechnicians began operating an entertainment radio stationin Tuzla.  *  31 Dec: US engineers finally completed the floatingribbon bridge over the Sava River, and a column of US tanksand armored vehicles from the 1/1 Cavalry began pouringsouth. (The center section of the bridge is removed each dayto allow barges to move along the river. The bridge includes85 floating segments, each 22 feet or 7m long. The totalspan of 600m is longer than the 400m pontoon bridge atRemagen in 1945. It actually includes a 373m span over theriver and a 225m span over a lagoon on the north bank.)Bosnian Serbs in Banja Luka were increasingly unhappy withtheir government  in Pale, which appeared to have no timefor anyone but the Serbs in the Sarajevo suburbs. The firstGerman military cargo ship arrived in Sibenik. Nervous NATOtroops watched as Bosnians of all factions celebrated thenew year with a fusillade of gunfire.Back to Headline List CopyrightFOR YOUR EYES ONLY via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996PEACE SCHEDULE FOR BOSNIA IN 1996  *  4 Jan: Lists of prisoners held by all sides exchanged.  *  13 Jan: All prisoners released.

Five former IRA members, all linked in some way to thedrug trade, were murdered in Ulster during December. Thepreviously unknown group Direct Action Against Drugs claimedcredit, but the British insisted it was the IRA. [TheBritish also did not regard these killings, as a violationof the ceasefire.] The murders cast a shadow over the peaceprocess, and the British cancelled plans to give 10 IRAprisoners early release. PM Majors said it was laughable forSinn Fein to continue claiming that it and the IRA weretotally separate organizations.     On 20 Dec, senior British and Irish officials met forthe first time with a leader of an Ulster political party(the moderate Alliance Party).Back to Headline List CopyrightFOR YOUR EYES ONLY via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996PERSIAN GULF: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95  *  18 Dec: Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmadal-Sabah (who had held the post for 30 years) offered toresign after foreign policy differences with Emir Jaberal-Ahmad al-Sabah, who then convinced him to stay on thejob.

The IAEA said that these items might have to befound and destroyed to meet the requirements of the UNsanctions. Iraq pledged to cooperate and said it was stillconsidering a UN resolution allowing limited oil sales tofund relief programs. President Clinton said he was ready totalk to Iran but that relations could not be normalizeduntil Iran stops supporting terrorist and subversive groups.  *  21 Dec: UN arms inspector Ekeus displayed a gyroscoperecovered from the Tigris River which showed Iraq was stilltrying to secretly build large ballistic missiles. KingHussein of Jordan warned that Iraq was close to the point ofcollapse. Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad al-Thani, deposed as emirof Qatar by his own son while on a trip to Europe, visitedthe neighboring UAE in a move widely thought to start acampaign to return to power.  *  22 Dec: The Iranian opposition group Mujahideen Khalqaccused Iranians of attacking one of their bases nearBaghdad with an 81mm mortar. Iran dismissed new USsanctions, saying the world would ignore them.  *  23 Dec: Iran began a three-day naval exercise in theGulf.  *  24 Dec: Iraqi Air Force Captain Asaad Rahdi Shadwan (arecent defector) told Kuwaiti authorities that Iraq hadmoved "eight batteries of Scud missiles" to a secretunderground storage facility 23km north of Basra last May.(Under the UN resolutions, Iraq is prohibited from owningScuds or deploying any missiles south of the 32nd parallel.)An Iraqi Air Force Major flew an Allouette helicopter (tailnumber 1037) to Arbil and defected. Iran said the allocationby the US Congress of funds for covert operations was"outright terrorism". The Iranians complained about this fora week, protesting in the UN and threatening to match thefunds with their own campaign against the US.  *  26 Dec: Jordan seized a shipment of "highly dangerousacids and chemicals" which had been hidden inside a shipmentof medicine being sent into Iraq. The Kuwaiti parliamentratified the UN Convention Against Torture. France pledgedto send 70,000 troops and 320 combat aircraft to the UAE ifit was threatened. [A similar deal with the British isstalled because the British refuse to put their troops underUAE law when deployed in that country as the French did. Thedefense pacts are intended to promote chances of arms salesto the UAE and other Gulf states.]  *  28 Dec: Iraq tightened its border with Jordan aftermoves by the Jordanian government against Saddam.

Turkey said his offer could not be takenseriously and continued its campaign of counter-insurgencyoperations. The EU approved the long-delayed customs unionwith Turkey on 13 Dec, but it did PM Ciller little good inthe elections.     Turkey held its new elections on 24 Dec. The IslamistWelfare Party won the most seats (21.13% and 159 seats) butnot enough to take power as no major parties would ally withthem. The opposition-conservative Motherland Party won19.66% (134 seats) while Prime Minister Ciller's True PathParty won 19.37% (133 seats). The conservatives ruled outany alliance with the Welfare Party, but negotiations tofind a working coalition could take weeks.

Syrian President Assad said on 19 Dec that hewanted the fighting to end, but only as part of an overallsettlement. Hezbollah fired a series of Katyusha rocketsinto northern Israel on 29-30 Dec specifically to disruptthe peace talks; one struck a house, but no one was injured.Israel said it knew that not everything Hezbollah did waswith Syrian permission, but that it also knew the Syrianscould stop the Hezbollah attacks if it chose to do so.     During a firefight on 29 Dec, Israeli tanks fired "beehive" flechette rounds (each loaded with thousands of steeldarts) into the village of Qabrikha, killing one man.

Syria said it was premature tohold a summit between President Assad and PM Peres.  *  20 Dec: Arafat gave his personal support to theIsraeli-Syrian peace talks to be held in Washington on 27Dec. Israel announced that in order to reduce tensions,Israeli Jews would not be allowed into thePalestinian-controlled town of Bethlehem starting the nextday. [This was intended to allow the locals, 40% of whom arePalestinian Christians, to celebrate Christmas withoutconflict.] The Palestinian police said the five Abu Nidalcommandoes captured while trying to assassinate Arafat hadbeen linked to Iran. [Iran denied any involvement.] Israelipolice said they had arrested 15 members of a Hamas cell inTulkarm that had planned a series of suicide bomb attacks onIsraelis. Israel banned seven US Jewish radicals fromentering the country or claiming citizenship.  *  21 Dec: Israeli troops left Bethlehem. Four days ofPLO-Hamas talks in Cairo had deadlocked. Hamas said it wouldnot take part in the elections but would do nothing to stopthem. It refused, however, to abandon violent attacks onIsraelis. Ariel Sharon decided not to challenge BenjaminNetanyahu for leadership of the Likud Party. The 13 banks inthe self-rule area were transferred to control of thePalestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority (PISGA).  *  22 Dec: Peres said Israel would "give up the atom"[i.e., its nuclear weapons] once regional peace wasestablished. Jewish militant groups were reportedly hatchingnew plots to kill Peres since the assassination of Rabin hadaccelerated, rather than stopped, the peace process. [Theymight have done "better" by killing Arafat or Hussein, asthat would have provoked war.]  *  23 Dec: Syrian President Assad, visiting Egypt forone-day talks, said he wanted to speed up the peace process.Samiha Khalil, a 72-year-old Palestinian rights activist,became the only opponent for Arafat in the presidentialrace. Deodorus I, the Greek Orthodox patriarch of the HolyLand, signed over custody of the Christian churches inBethlehem to Arafat. [Moslem Caliph Omar had signed thosesame churches, or at least churches on the same sites, overto Patriarch Sophronius in 638AD. The symbolic return ofcontrol supposedly strengthens Arafat's position indemanding control over East Jerusalem, as it shows he can betrusted to protect the shrines of another faith.]  *  24 Dec: The Israeli High Court of Justice banned theShin Bet security service from using physical force duringinterrogations. Arafat condemned Hamas for boycotting theelections. Israeli officials were surprised at the optimismshown by Assad but said the extent of its withdrawal fromGolan and remaining security provisions was dependent on theextent of the peace Syria offered. Israeli Foreign MinisterBarak said it was time for Gulf and Maghreb Arab states tomake peace with Israel. [Those states have always insistedthat Israel must make peace with all of its neighbors first.Barak was hoping for more pressure on Syria.] Palestiniangunmen wounded an Israeli soldier on the Gaza border. Agroup of radical Israeli settlers "just happened" to decideto visit the tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem to pray, knowingthat the Israeli troops guarding the "border" of theself-rule zone would not allow them into the city. They thenflooded the Internet with stories about how Israeli soldiershad enforced anti-Jewish racism.     An Israeli court-martial sentenced 31 paratroopers to56 days in jail for abandoning their post on the northernborder for less than an hour on 21 Dec. The men felt thattheir new commander was not competent and said he did nottake the advice they had offered. When the dispute reachedan impasse after four months of arguing, some members of thecompany walked out of their post, then returned when theyhad cooled down. They could have been sentenced to 15 yearsin prison.

Opposition parties demanded the removal of theSindh provincial government (made up by Bhutto's party)because it could not end violence in Karachi.     TAIWAN is interested in buying two used Dutchsubmarines. Taiwan denied a report that it would develop itsown medium-range ballistic missile. President Lee said on 31Dec that he wanted reunification with China but Taiwan must"walk tall" and seek its own diplomatic status until thattime comes.     TIMOR: After another wave of Timorese youth stormedinto foreign embassies in Jakarta demanding asylum,Indonesia increased security around the diplomatic quarter.Indonesia said on 25 Dec that it would take steps to crushthe rebellion on Timor but would not send more troops.Simbolan said on 28 Dec that the Fretilin rebels on Timornumbered 202 people with 94 weapons and had split intoseveral rival factions. Indonesia said it had spent $832million on development projects in Timor over the last 20years and the people had nothing to revolt about.

However, because of blizzard conditions on the East Coast, Pena'sspeech was delayed until after our deadline.  Look for full coveragein the next issue of GLOBAL POSITIONING & NAVIGATION NEWS.     The ITS industry received a financial boost late last year byCongress in the form of $223 million in 1996 funding (GPNN, Nov. 30,1995, p. 1).  Of the $223 million, nearly $110 million in new ITSfunding was set aside by Congress.  Approximately $113 million wastargeted for ITS through the "1991 Intermodal Surface TransportationAct."     Last year, there were concerns, because of budget constraints,that ITS funding would be "zeroed" out by the Republican majority.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL POSITIONING & NAVIGATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996ROCKWELL NAMES PATHMASTER MARKETING PARTNERS     To extinguish persisting rumors that it may not be committing tovehicle navigation markets, Rockwell Automotive Electronics recentlysigned multi-year contracts with Directional Technologies and EntronixInternational Inc. for nationwide distribution and service forRockwell's GPS-based PathMaster vehicle navigation unit.     "We feel we have the best vehicle navigation system in theindustry.  Now we believe we have the best distribution and service,"said Roger Stevens, Rockwell Automotive Electronics general manager. The announcement came at the recent trade show that many vehiclenavigation units are now being showcased: the 1996 InternationalWinter Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.     Troy, Mich.-based Directional Technologies, which is experiencedin aftermarket products for corporate fleet accounts, will begin itsportion of the contract by establishing a nationwide dealer network,the company said.     George Derderian, Directional Technologies president, said thedeal with Rockwell gives his company a competitive edge in driverinformation systems and traffic telematics.  He also said thatDirectional Technologies wanted to enter the wireless integrationproduct field to include GPS, cellular and wireless data integration.     In addition, Directional Technologies will provide nationaldistribution and marketing support that will include commercial andcorporate accounts.     The company will establish offices in large metropolitan areas toprovide installation, sales, customer service and marketing supportfor PathMaster.Minneapolis-based Entronix International will provide repair andremanufacture services and establish a nationwide installation networkfor PathMaster.     Entronix plans to distribute PathMaster to new car dealers. Distribution initially is planned for the San Francisco Bay area.     The company will establish a chain of installation, repair andremanufacturing outlets nationwide, the company said.  Entronix willuse its experience, which includes distribution of car stereos andrelated products, for PathMaster's service and installationactivities, the company said.     Currently, map data bases are available for the PathMaster systemin Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orlando,San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.  In 1996, Rockwell hopes to expandthe system to Austin, Texas; Albuquerque, N.M.; Boston; Denver;Dallas; Houston; Minneapolis; Philadelphia; Phoenix; San Antonio,Texas; and Seattle.     The Rockwell-based vehicle navigation system is featured inHertz, Avis and National Car Rental vehicles.

However, a saturation point may be realized in about five yearsas trucking fleets, taxi cab companies and service fleets realize thebenefits of GPS-based fleet management.     In a contract worth more than $3.3 million, GMSI, Canadiansubsidiary of Montvale, N.J.-based Geotek Communications Inc. and CEITechnologies sold 4,400 GPS-based units to Comfort Transportation inSingapore.  The units will go into the nation's largest taxi fleet.     First deliveries are scheduled for later this month, with theremaining units to be shipped by June.  With options, the deal couldcall for as many as 9,500 more units sold to Comfort Transportation.     Although its survey and mapping sales continue to see high salesto lead the company, Trimble Navigation recently sold GPS/AVL systemsto public safety fleets in Aurora, Colo.; Monterrey, Calif.; and aparatransit agency in San Jose, Calif.  A total of 122 units were soldto the three companies.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL POSITIONING & NAVIGATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996GPS COMPANIES NOT HAPPY WITH SECURITIES LAWSUITS     Although there are not many publicly traded GPS companies,several are defending themselves against securities lawsuits that areplaguing high-technology firms.  Dallas-based HighwayMasterCommunications Inc. recently was named in a securities class-actionlawsuit in a Texas federal court.     The lawsuit alleges that the company's registration statement,prospectus and other information contained in its June 1995 initialpublic offering (IPO) contained "false and misleading" statements.     The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, named the company,its board of directors and lead underwriters from the IPO.  Anattorney for HighwayMaster declined to be interviewed.     Another company also fed up with the plethora of lawsuits is Trimble Navigation Ltd., which has seen its stock go from about $8 tomore than $30, then drop to less than $20.     Trimble recently was named in a securities class-action lawsuitthat was aimed at companies that experience a wide swing in stockvalue.  The same San Diego-based law firm that is suing HighwayMasteris suing Trimble and other companies.     "I cannot understand the justification for permitting theprosecution of these [lawsuits], primarily benefitting lawyers underthe guise of protecting shareholders.  A clever niche market [has]been discovered to drain the energy out of the entrepreneurialprocess," said Trimble President and CEO Charles Trimble.     He said that the lawsuits will hurt high-technology companies'ability to compete in international markets.     Trimble also said it only takes one disgruntled shareholder toextract millions of dollars from companies.  The cost is then passedback to the shareholder in terms of insurance premiums, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL POSITIONING & NAVIGATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996BATTELLE USING SIEMENS ROUTE GUIDANCE SYSTEM     As part of a $14 million Federal Highway Administration project,Battelle's Transportation Division is using an in-vehicle devicemanufactured by Siemens for a Traveler Information Showcase in Atlantathis summer.

More and more GPS companies and software vendors looked topartner with the big cellular, personal communication services, landmobile radio and mobile satellite players to gain a foothold inlucrative consumer markets.             The market segment that always has been growing has been surveyand mapping, with three to four companies always at the top of theheap in sales.      One company even had a top-drawing survey showthat solidified its lead in that market.  However, even that companyhas been making inroads into other areas such as automatic vehiclelocation, vehicle navigation and even for the sparse defensecontracts.  Other companies have been dominant in defense marketrealms, original equipment manufacturer products and consumer GPS.     In 1991, the GPS industry was looked upon as a defense offshoot. Companies looked for growth as the constellation was developed by theU.S. Air Force.     Some concentrated in handheld receiver markets, others left aftera year or two because consumer interest was low.  Now, as theconstellation and industry mature, companies are finding more ways tointegrate GPS and other technology for consumer market entry.     As we begin 1996, several GPS industry executives took the timeto reflect on the status of the industry and how their companies faredin 1995.  Each company has found its niche in a particular navigationand positioning market--and now are looking to expand into other areasin 1996.       Here's what the executives had to say:Charles TrimblePresident and CEO, Trimble Navigation:     "1995 has been another great year for the industry.  [Geographicinformation systems] and tracking have been really strong and we arealso seeing the emergency of a strong avionics market.       "For 1996, land survey should experience continued growth in unitvolume, although the average selling price is dropping.  Carnavigation opportunities will continue to expand with unit volumesanticipated to double again."Robert DenaroDirector, Motorola Positioning and Navigation Systems Business:     "I think our strategy includes [going after] the biggest volumemarket opportunities, not niche markets.  In our core GPS business, weare starting to see volume increases in automatic vehicle location andtiming markets.     "Simultaneously, we are seeing technology advancesin GPS that are bringing the cost down.  So the prospects for 1996look very good.  A lot of press attention went to autonomousnavigation markets, but the late bloomer is wireless integration [ofGPS].     "The great thing about wireless integration is that it willenable a lot of people to get involved in GPS--to add value to[existing products], and fuel the growth of the industry.  In thepast, it was one thing for a company to sell a handheld GPS to ahiker.  Now, with wireless integrator, that's a huge enabler. Ford isseeing a tremendous response to the Motorola Rescu system--and we arehearing from people in the industry who are replicating [wirelessintegration efforts]."Chuck BoesenbergPresident, Ashtech Inc.:     "1995 has been an evolutionary year for Ashtech.  Late in 1994,majority control of the company was assumed by Patricof and Co.Ventures Inc., a New York-based venture capital firm.  Bill Bottomswas named chairman of the board and I was named president and CEO.     "We added two new board members, Rocky Pimentel of LSI Logic andChet Silvestri of Sun Microsystems.  We reorganized the executivestaff to include Todd Townsend as vice president of productdevelopment, Sergei Gourevitch as chief scientist and Len Kruczynskias director of strategic relationships.     "We acquired Springhill Engineering, a company which develops andmarkets precision farming equipment using GPS technology.  Ashtechalso entered into significant strategic partnerships in 1995.  Inaddition to our ongoing relationship with Topcon, we added PhilipsSemiconductor, Geotronics AB, and Sokkia Corp.      "These partnerships have expanded our area of expertise andmarketshare. Additionally, because Ashtech values the dedicationdemonstrated by its employees we have added programs internally toreward that dedication.     "We feel the key to GPS realizing its full potential will beadding applications that provide value for all people.  To this end,we will continue to acquire companies, enter new vertical markets andcreate strategic relationships.  Ashtech will continue to explore andenter partnerships and develop products that will allow us to pursueand achieve excellence in precision positioning."W.H. PomijeDirector of Guidance and NavigationRockwell International's Collins Avionics & Communications Division:         "In 1995, Rockwell's Collins Avionics & Communications Division,as the largest supplier of full military accuracy GPS receiver systemsto the [Defense Department], witnessed several major events.  One wasa ceremony marking the delivery of the 50,000th PLGR (PrecisionLightweight GPS Receiver) to the DoD.  The honored guest and recipientwas Lt. Gen. Otto Guenther, director of Information Systems forCommand, Control, Communications and Computers.     "Another important milestone was the selection of Collinsembedded GPS by McDonnell Douglas for the Joint Direct Attack Munition(JDAM).  Major implications in the growth of GPS technology havepermitted Collins receivers to a) decrease in cost, b) improve inperformance and capability, and c) the growth in the number ofapplications, including the PLGR+Gun Laying System to swiftly surveyin mortars, artillery and mechanized howitzers, PLGR+ 96 receiver withmajor enhancements, VPLGR+96 (Vehicular Precision Lightweight GPSReceiver), development of miniature PLGR P-code engines, anddeployment of the lightweight, wearable plug-and-play Y-code Hunterreceiver.  Several countries, including Denmark, Norway, New Zealand,and Germany, have chosen the PLGR as the standard GPS for theirarmies.     "For 1996, Collins Avionics & Communications Division foreseesmore of the same, with further price decreases, continued performanceenhancements, and a steady growth in applications.  At least a halfdozen new surface mobility GPS receiver systems will be introducedduring 1996, aimed directly at helping digitize the battlefield.  Andmore countries will join the those where PLGR receivers already are indaily use by armed forces and approved government agencies.     "[In addition to our defense products,] our GPS/geographicinformation system-based precision farming product, VISION SYSTEM, isexpected to have a major impact in the agricultural marketplace interms of cost savings and reducing environmental issues associatedwith farming.

Manufacturerswill continue to gain publicity for new systems and consumer educationand awareness to vehicle navigation systems' benefits.      At the recent 1996 International Winter Consumer Electronics Show(CES) in Las Vegas, GPS-based vehicle navigation products wereshowcased in front of an estimated 100,000 attendees.  Companiesparticipating in an ITS America pavilion included Etak Inc.,Navigation Technologies, Rockwell Automotive Electronics, Siemens ITSNorth America, Sony Corp. and Delco Electronics Corp.     Other vendors at CES, such as Sanyo Fisher Corp. and ClarionSales Corp., displayed vehicle navigation units for consumer awareness--notnecessarily to showcase for future U.S. sales.     However, the consumer electronics manufacturers seem to becoupling the navigation systems with entertainment systems withseveral features.  The current train of thought for marketing managersis to integrate vehicle navigation capability into radios, CD playersand other entertainment electronics to spur the industry.      Sanyo's unit at CES, its new NV-P1, is the first portablenavigation system with a built-in GPS antenna, color LCD monitor witha TV tuner, CD-ROM and a CD player.  NV-P1 can locate the best travela route for a consumer and features Etak digitized maps, the companysaid.  The NV-P1 has Naviken format navigation map software.     The unit is selling in Japan for nearly $1,500, but there is noscheduled date for its introduction to the U.S. market, Sanyo said. Sources said that only time will tell if vehicle navigation marketswill do half as well in the United States as those in Japan. Currently, more than 500,000 vehicle navigation units are being soldin Japan for a variety of reasons.     The unit constitutes the first U.S. unit to have a video port sodrivers can view videos and even TV while driving with a built-in TVantenna.  A number of states have loosen laws that preclude atelevision screen in a vehicle.  However, it may take a few yearsbefore drivers may watch TV in vehicles--even if the LCD screen alsoserves as a vehicle navigation screen.     The unit can be taken out of a vehicle for portable use--afeature that may be important in the U.S. market.     Clarion also is integrated navigation systems with car multimediaproducts.  In addition to a VRN1100 voice navigation system, thecompany offers a in-dash, hands-free cellular telephone, CD player,cassette player and TV monitor.    The VRN1100, which costs about$650, does not use GPS as its navigation engine.  It uses a voice-activated system that uses a car's wheel bearings for control.     To activate the system, a person say "navigator," and the systemspells out the starting point and destination, which can be a street address, cross streets or landmark such as an airport.  If morethan one location exists, the VRN1100 tells the user what the betterroute would be, the company said.      The VRN1100 maps cover Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Detroit;Chicago; Indianapolis; New York/New Jersey; Northern and SouthernCalifornia; and Las Vegas.     Clarion said the company may introduce GPS-based units in theUnited States, but that move depends on market acceptance of similarunits made by other companies.  In Japan, the company's vehiclenavigation units equipped with GPS, like competitor's versions, havebeen a huge success.  Trying to replicate that success in the U.S. maytake two to three more years, sources said.    ...Trimble-Delco Sign Vehicle Navigation Deal      To grab part of a vehicle navigation market it expects to grow tomore than $3 billion by the end of the century, Trimble Navigation andDelco recently signed a memorandum of understanding to developconsumer automobile GPS products.     Although Delco has been using Trimble GPS board in its Telepath100 series vehicle navigation units, the memorandum makes Trimble itsexclusive provider of GPS receivers.  Last year, Delco droppedRockwell as its GPS vendor.     Trimble, always considered a market leader in the survey andmapping, has acknowledged that vehicle navigation constitutes thecompany's largest growth opportunity.       At CES, Delco and Chatsworth, Calif.-based ORA Electronicsdisplayed a Telepath 100 unit to provide vehicle navigation and hands-free cellular interface capability.  Gershon Cooper, ORA's presidentsaid the cars of the future "are going to be like giant computers withwheels."     The ORA cellular system, called Telecar, is compatible with mostcellular phones and is designed to integrate into most Delco radios. The company is marketing the system at Circuit City and Tandy'sIncredible Universe.  The company plans to ship the units in 1996'sfirst four months.     In addition to cellular capability, Delco is enhancing itsTelepath 100 with its EyeCue head-up display.  EyeCue projects animage of navigational information on a vehicle's windshield to allowusers to keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel,Delco said.     Delco's Telepath 200 series include GPS, the cellular system andan AM/FM entertainment system.  Both the Telepath 100 and Telepath 200systems have a PCMCIA memory card that features a single displayindicating a user's navigational menu choices and directional buttons. The distance to a user's destination also is displayed.         Overall, vehicle navigation companies are relying on early rentalcar consumer acceptance of the vehicle navigation units to boost theindustry's market.  Avis Inc.'s Satellite Guidance vehicle navigationunits will be available at Denver International Airport, the companysaid.  The Rockwell-built unit currently is available in California;Florida; Nevada; Georgia; New York; Washington, D.C.; and in theMidwest in Chicago; Detroit; and Indianapolis.     A large advertising campaign for the units has boosted brand namerecognition not only for vehicle navigation, but for GPS, because manyconsumers still do not know how the system works.P.S.

The settlement, approved Nov. 17 by the U.S. District Courtfor the Western District of Texas, is the first qui tam suit to bemade public in the San Antonio division.     Relator M.W. Reed's company, Med National Inc., often competedwith Sterling Medical Associates in the late 1980s for contracts tosupply radiologists for military health care operations.  Sterlingconsistently underbid Med National, and Reed, suspecting Sterlingof gaining an unfair advantage, investigated the company'spractices.     Reed filed his qui tam action in U.S. District Court for theWestern District of Texas, alleging that Sterling falsely certifiedthat it was a small business in bids for 11 government contractswith the Army, Navy and Air Force totalling $5.5 million.  Reedalleged that from 1986 to 1989, Sterling's revenues were higherthan the $3.5 million limit entitling companies to bid as a smallbusiness.  Government regulations give small business priority incontract procurement.     The defendants denied liability for the allegations, statingthat it would have cost them more to litigate the case.

GRANTS HUGHESSTAY OF ISSUANCE INQUI TAM ACTION     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals Nov. 29 granted HughesAircraft Co.'s motion to stay issuance of mandate pending itspetition to the U.S. Supreme Court that challenges the panel'sdenial of its motion for summary judgment regarding qui tamallegations that Hughes misappropriated the technology costs offighter jet contracts to various subcontractors.  Schumer v. HughesAircraft Co., Nos. 92-55759 and 92-55857 (9th Cir.);  seeGovernment Contract LR, Dec. 21, 1995.     The panel granted the stay after denying Hughes' petition forrehearing on Nov. 17.     Relator William J. Schumer, a former Hughes manager, filed aqui tam complaint in U.S. District Court for the Central Districtof California, alleging that Hughes mischarged expenditures to theB-2 bomber program that should have been charged to the F-15fighter jet program.  After finding that the government and theprograms' subcontractors were previously made aware of theallocations by an audit, the district court granted Hughes' motionfor summary judgment.     The Ninth Circuit on Aug. 22 upheld the lower court'sdetermination that Hughes did not defraud the government.  However,it reversed the grant of summary judgment, finding a genuine issueof material fact regarding the allegations that Hughes entered intounauthorized commonality agreements.     In its petition for rehearing, Hughes asserted that the NinthCircuit erred in holding that government audits do not constitutepublic disclosure and that Schumer's suit is valid under the FalseClaims Act.  Hughes argued that government contractor employees arenot included in a "closed loop of secrecy," because there "is noaspect of secrecy in defense procurement that would require keepingillegal conduct secret."

United States ex rel. Seckler v. Healthy BuildingsInternational.     Ruling from the bench, Judge William B. Bryant of the U.S.District Court for the District of Columbia lifted a stay ondiscovery and allowed relator Jeffrey Seckler, a former employee ofHBI, to file an amended complaint.     Seckler alleged in his qui tam complaint that between 1986 and1992, HBI fraudulently conducted inspections of federal buildingsand submitted inspection reports that were fraudulent and false.Seckler charged that HBI has a secret contractual relationship withThe Tobacco Institute (TI), a trade association funded by leadingtobacco companies, "to provide inspection reports that would notfocus on the harms caused by cigarettes, to reduce and adjust thedata from tests, ...to show reduced levels of and less harmfuleffects from smoking, and to testify against smoking bans."     In return, Seckler said, TI and the tobacco interests paid HBIa fee for each inspection, provided HBI other fees and subsidies,and "under the guise of grants [from Philip Morris, through TI],"provided "hundreds of thousand of dollars to publish HealthyBuildings International Magazine, which TI and Philip Morrisused...to combat the anti-smoking movement."     The complaint also alleges that TI told HBI employees to lieabout their motivation for testifying and that HBI employees werepaid to spy on anti-smoking individuals and groups.  Additionally,the complaint asserts, TI secretly reviewed many of HBI's speechesand releases and conspired with tobacco companies to funnel moneyto HBI in return for favorable inspections or testimony.     "Despite the fact that by the mid-to-late 1980s HBI wasvirtually a front for the tobacco interests, defendant HBI neverdisclosed its relationship and agreements...to the United Stateswhen it contracted to do the inspections..., leading the UnitedStates to believe HBI's inspections would be impartial, fair,honest and unbiased, which HBI knew in advance they would not andcould not be," the complaint states.     According to the complaint, HBI routinely altered inspectiontests to reduce the impact of smoking but never disclosed thispractice to the United States.  Meanwhile, the complaint said, HBIboasted of its contract with the government in promotionalmaterials and used the existing government contracts to obtainfurther business with other federal and state agencies.     Seckler said that HBI employees were told that any airpollution problems could be alleviated by installing betterventilation and that the employees were never to suggest thatsmoking be banned or restricted.  Seckler also maintained that hewas instructed to lie about his identity when testifying againstsmoking bans.     Seckler said he was dismissed by HBI in September 1991,allegedly because of poor productivity and expense accountirregularities.     The plaintiff contends that the contracts signed by the UnitedStates and HBI were false and fraudulent and seek relief under theFalse Claims Act.  The lawsuit seeks restitution, treble damagesand costs.     Seckler is represented by Alexander J.

REFUSES TOHEAR WRONGFUL DISCHARGESUIT AGAINST HUGHES     The California Supreme Court Dec. 4 refused to review apetition filed by a former in-house attorney of Hughes Aircraft Co.challenging a Superior Court determination that the attorney wasnot constructively discharged after refusing to accept a demotion,because he failed to prove that Hughes created intolerable workingconditions.  Karambelas v. Hughes Aircraft Co., No. S050046 (CASup. Ct.).     The demotion stemmed from the attorney's supervision of a $45million patent infringement settlement between Hughes and FordMotor Co., which later caused Hughes to release its claims againstthe government in a separate suit worth $270 million.     Petitioner Anthony W. Karambelas was employed by Hughes as theassistant general counsel in charge of patents and licensing.  Heoversaw the company's patent litigation and was the main contactwith outside counsel representing Hughes in various suits.     Hughes was the plaintiff in two 1987 patent infringement suitsinvolving the "Williams patent," named for the Hughes employee whoinvented a satellite orbiting device.  One defendant, Ford MotorCo., was accused of infringing upon Hughes' rights in the Williamspatent.  The U.S. government was sued in the other action for itspurchase and use of satellites infringing the Williams patent,which included 13 Ford satellites.  Latham & Watkins representedHughes in the Ford case, and other outside lawyers representedHughes in the government case.  Ford settled the case in August1987 for $45 million.     Several drafts of the settlement documents prepared by Latham& Watkins and reviewed by Karambelas contained a release of allpatent infringement claims against Ford.  Karambelas testified thatalthough he thought the release's language was "very broad," henever imagined that it would "operate as a release of Hughes'claims against the government."  The documents were signed inSeptember 1987.     The government learned of the Ford settlement, and moved forpartial summary judgment on the ground that Hughes relinquished itsWilliams patent infringement claims.  The U.S. Court of FederalClaims granted the motion.  Hughes retained counsel to investigatethe handling of the settlement, which concluded that Karambelas andLatham & Watkins negligently released Hughes' claims against thegovernment.  Upon its counsel's advice, Hughes did not sue Latham& Watkins for legal malpractice.     In May 1989, Hughes' general counsel notified Karambelas thathe was being demoted from assistant general counsel to patentcounsel due to his handling of the Ford settlement, his"administrative failings," and his inability to work with fellowlawyers.     Karambelas did not accept the demotion, and was told by Hughesthat his only other choice was to resign.  Karambelas did notreturn to Hughes after May 22.  He refused to sign a release andheld out for a "more appropriate" severance package.  Hughesrefused to increase the package, and notified Karambelas that hehad been "terminated for cause."     Karambelas filed suit against the company in Los AngelesCounty Superior Court, alleging wrongful termination, defamation,invasion of privacy and blacklisting based on newspaper articlesdescribing the Ford settlement as a "major legal blunder" andKarambelas as a "macho style" manager who left behindadministrative problems.  Hughes moved for summary judgment, orsummary adjudication of issues, asserting that Karambelas quit andwas not fired, that his demotion was not a constructive discharge,"and that Hughes did not provide the newspaper article information.     Hughes was granted summary judgment on the ground thatKarambelas quit and that Hughes did not provide information to thepress regarding the settlement or his performance at Hughes.     Karambelas appealed to the California Court of Appeal,contending that there were disputed facts regarding his terminationand that the trial court "seriously misapprehended its function inruling on a summary judgment motion."  The state high court paneldisagreed and denied review.     The panel noted that the facts regarding Karambelas' departurefrom Hughes are "irrelevant."  "What matters is his conduct(expressly refusing to accept the demotion and telling hiscoworkers he was leaving) and his own admissions at hisdeposition," the panel held.  "It follows that the facts wereundisputed and that the trial court properly found that Karambelasquit."     The panel also rejected Karambelas' assertions that, if hequit, it was a constructive discharge and triable issues ofmaterial fact existed regarding that issue.  Citing to Turner v.Anheuser-Busch, Inc., (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1251, the panel foundKarambelas failed to prove that Hughes "intentionally created orknowingly permitted" intolerable working conditions compelling himto resign.     "Demotion, even if unfair or outrageous, does not by itselfcreate the sort of 'intolerable' working condition that is requiredto establish constructive discharge, and a claim based upon ademotion must be supported by evidence of something more, such asharassment," the panel held.     In addition, the panel rejected Karambelas' claim that therewere triable issues of fact regarding his defamation, invasion ofprivacy and blacklisting claims.  The panel found Hughes met itsburden of showing that it did not furnish the press withinformation and, thus, showed that Karambelas' claims weremeritless.     Arguing for Karambelas was solo practitioner Gary D. Stabileof Manhattan Beach, CA.  Arguing for Hughes were Paul Grossman, J.Al Latham Jr. and George W. Abele of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &Walker in Los Angeles.Back to Headline List CopyrightGOVERNMENT CONTRACT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 4, 19968TH CIRCUIT UPHOLDSED MI DISMISSAL OFENGINEER'S BIVENS CLAIM     A Missouri federal district court properly dismissed a formercivilian Army engineer's Bivens claim that the Army fired himbecause he publicly disclosed allegations that the Army wascovering up reliability problems and providing second-rateequipment to soldiers during the Gulf War, the Eighth Circuit U.S.Court of Appeals held Dec. 21.  Weber v. Buhrkuhl et al., No. 95-2554 (8th Cir.).     The circuit court held that the plaintiff's allegations werebarred by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and theWhistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA).     During the Gulf War, civilian Army engineer Calvin J. Webertold various news organizations and U.S. legislators that the Armywas covering up reliability problems and not providing the bestequipment available to soldiers.  The Army terminated Weber inJune 1993.     Weber filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the EasternDistrict of Missouri, alleging a violation of his First Amendmentright to free speech and seeking compensation under Bivens v. SixUnknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388(1971), in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that the plaintiffswere entitled to monetary damages because their Fourth Amendmentright against unreasonable search and seizure was violated byfederal agents acting under color of authority.     Weber maintained that his free speech and due process rightswere violated when federal officials allegedly made falsestatements and perjured themselves when Weber appealed therevocation of his security clearance and his termination.  Thedistrict court granted the Army's motion to dismiss for failure tostate a claim, holding that Weber's allegations were conclusory andthat his due process rights were not violated when his securityclearance was taken away, because he had no right to clearance inthe first place.     Weber appealed, and in a three-page opinion, the EighthCircuit upheld the lower court's findings, noting that even ifWeber's allegations amounted to a constitutional violation, theCSRA and the WPA bar such claims.  The CSRA prevents the creationof new judicial remedies for federal employees whose FirstAmendment rights are violated by superiors.     "We disagree with Weber that the defendants' actions falloutside the scope of CSRA 'prohibited personnel practices,'" thepanel held.     The panel added that the district court properly found thatWeber's due process claim based on revocation of his securityclearance was not a constitutional violation.Back to Headline List CopyrightGOVERNMENT CONTRACT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 4, 19966TH CIR. REINSTATES SUITDESPITE FAILURE TO PRODUCEOFFICER FOR DISCOVERY     The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 reinstateda breach of contract complaint although the plaintiff repeatedlyfailed to produce an officer for depositions.  Roots Contractingand Trading Co. v. Creighton Ltd. et al., No. 94-5752 (6th Cir.).     The panel said if the suit is again dismissed, the trial courtmust provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other reasonsto support the inference that Roots engaged in a course of conductto evade deposition and it must explain why lesser sanctions wererejected.     Roots Contracting and Trading, a Qatari limited liabilitycompany, contracted for a joint venture with Creighton Ltd., aCayman Islands corporation headquartered in Nashville, to build agovernment-sponsored hospital in Qatar.  The Qatari governmentterminated the construction contract due to Creighton's workdeficiencies and delays.     Roots sued Creighton and other defendants in the MiddleDistrict of Tennessee for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,dissolution of the joint venture, breach of contract and anaccounting.     During the Persian Gulf War, two codefendants noticed theNashville deposition of Abdullah Hamad Al-Attiyah, who chairedRoots' board of directors and served as managing agent.  At thetime, Al-Attiyah was chief of the cabinet of the Qatari InteriorMinistry.     Roots opposed the deposition, contending Al-Attiyah was merelya passive minority shareholder who performed no managerial duties,received no salary and knew nothing about the company's businessoperations; Roots also said its general manager, who was deposed,had the same knowledge as Al-Attiyah about the hospital project.However, the defendants offered evidence Al-Attiyah was a policymaker and an operational factor in Roots.     Al-Attiyah failed repeatedly to appear.  Roots argued that theQatari interior minister had refused to allow him to leave thecountry; meanwhile, he rose to become minister of energy andindustry and president of OPEC.  Ultimately, Chief Judge John T.Nixon granted a defense motion to dismiss the complaint as adiscovery sanction.     The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded in a per curiamopinion.  Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizedismissal as a sanction for the refusal of an officer, director ormanaging agent to provide discovery, this particular dismissal wasan abuse of discretion, the panel held.  Judge Nixon failed toarticulate sufficient findings of fact to justify the sanction, itsaid.     If Judge Nixon again dismisses the complaint on remand, hemust provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other reasonsfor Roots' failure to produce Al-Attiyah to support the inferencethat Roots engaged in a course of conduct to evade deposition.Those findings also should explain why lesser sanctions wererejected, it said.  In addition, it said there should be findingsas to how the defendants would be prejudiced if they cannot deposeAl-Attiyah in Nashville.Back to Headline List CopyrightGOVERNMENT CONTRACT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996CFC CAN HEAR CLAIMSLATER FILED IN FED.DIST. CT., CAFC RULES     The U.S. Court of Federal Claims may retain jurisdiction overa claim that is subsequently filed in federal district court, theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) ruled Dec. 26,reversing and remanding a suit filed by a government contractorseeking equitable adjustment for a flood control project contract.Hardwick Brothers Co. II v. United States, No. 93-5050 (CAFC).     In its determination, the panel reviewed the language of 28U.S.C. Section 1500 and concluded that as long as the claim isfiled first in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), the court mayretain jurisdiction.     In 1980, Hardwick Brothers Co. II contracted with the ArmyCorps of Engineers (COE) to build a levee for a flood controlproject in Missouri.  Six years later, Hardwick submitted a claimto the contracting officer under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA)for adjustments to the contract price.               The COE denied the claim, and Hardwick filed suit in the CFC,seeking damages based on defective specifications, differing siteconditions, rescission of a changed proposal, contract reformationand failure to disclose superior knowledge.  After waiting 18months for an opinion, Hardwick filed a Federal Tort Claims Actsuit in March 1992 in the U.S. District Court for the WesternDistrict of Missouri to avoid a time bar based on spoliation ofevidence.     Meanwhile, in April 1992, the CAFC issued an opinion in UNRIndustries, Inc. v. United States, 962 F.2d 1013 (Fed. Cir. 1992),which upheld the CFC's dismissal of asbestos manufacturers' claimsfor indemnification for several personal injury suits.  Theseclaims were filed against the government in various districtcourts, which were pending when the manufacturers filed the samesuits in the CFC.     In UNR, the CAFC noted that under 28 U.S.C. Section 1500, it"shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect towhich the plaintiff...has pending in any other court any suit orprocess against the United States."     After the issuance of the UNR decision, Hardwick dismissed itsdistrict court action before the government responded.  Then, thegovernment moved to dismiss Hardwick's CFC action, maintaining thatjurisdiction was not restored by Hardwick's dismissal of itsdistrict court action.     The court dismissed the claim without prejudice, holding thatthere was "no material difference in the operative facts in the twoactions" and that, because the UNR decision is retroactive,dismissal was required.  The trial court denied Hardwick's motionfor reconsideration and denied the contractor's pending motions tofile an amended and supplemental complaint as moot.     Hardwick appealed to the CAFC, which reversed the decision ofthe trial court.     The CAFC panel referred to Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. UnitedStates, 170 Ct.Cl. 389, 343 F.2d 943 (1965), in which the CFCexamined Section 1500 and determined that the CFC can retainjurisdiction if a claim was filed there before being filed in afederal district court.  The CAFC noted that the Supreme Court didnot overturn Tecon, and it "acknowledged the continuing vitality ofTecon as an established precedent."     The CAFC rejected the government's argument that Tecon shouldbe limited to the "unusual" facts of that case.  "Nothing in Tecon,UNR, or our recent cases citing Tecon supports such a limitation,"held the panel. "[T]he trial court indicated that its decision onthe merits of Hardwick's claim was ready to issue, then thiscourt's decision in UNR prompted dismissal of the claim."  Thepanel remanded the case for judgment in accordance with the trialcourt's decision on the merits.               Arguing for Hardwick were Michael J. Blake of Sandler, Balkin,Hellman & Weinstein of Kansas City, with Lawrence Lerner on brief.Arguing for the government was Margaret L. Baskette of theCommercial Litigation Branch of the Department of Justice,Washington, DC.  On brief were Assistant Attorney General Frank W.Hunger, Director David M. Cohen and E.

Fairchild Industries, Inc.v. United States, No. 94-5116 (CAFC).     In its Nov. 29 opinion, the panel found that the U.S. Court ofFederal Claims incorrectly held that because the contractorexpected to be paid for the research by the government, it "did notitself incur" the expenses.     In July 1982, Fairchild Industries, Inc. entered into a fixed-price incentive contract to produce the T-46A training aircraft forthe U.S. Air Force.  The contract included a full-scale development(FSD) phase in which Fairchild was to develop two prototypeaircraft.  Under the contract, the Air Force was to pay forresearch only if Fairchild met the contract specifications.     Under the contract, the Air Force paid bimonthly progresspayments, which were a percentage of the expenditures Fairchildincurred.  After formal acceptance of a line item, the payment wasliquidated by being credited against the total fixed price.  If theAir Force terminated the contract for default, all payments wererepayable to the Air Force under the contract.     The ceiling price for the FSD phase was $133 million.  WhenCongress cancelled the T-46A program in late 1986, the Air Forcepaid Fairchild $53 million for the completed work, and $60.8million in unliquidated progress payments.  The two parties agreedto termination for convenience.     An Air Force audit showed Fairchild completed 90% of the FSDwork and was entitled to payment of $120.6 million.  The $53million in liquidated progress payments and the $60.8 million inunliquidated payments were applied, and the remaining $6.8 millionwas paid.     Fairchild reported $109.4 million in research expenses on its1982-1985 federal income tax returns.  The Internal Revenue Servicedisallowed $50.3 million, maintaining that it was "funded" by theAir Force.  As a consequence of this decision, the IRS disallowed$5.8 million in research tax credits claimed by Fairchild for 1983and 1984.     The research tax credit was created by the Economic RecoveryTax Act of 1981, which provides a tax credit of 25% of increasedresearch expenditures, which are compared with a baseline measuredby the previous three years' research expenditures.  Under the act,a contract customer can claim a research tax credit only if thecontract requires the customer to pay for the research even if itis unsuccessful.  However, the customer cannot claim a tax creditif the contract provides that the customer does not have to pay ifthe research is successful.     Fairchild filed a claim for the tax credit in the U.S. Courtof Federal Claims, which held that because Fairchild expected thatit would be paid for the research by the Air Force, it "did notitself incur" the expenses because they were "funded" by thegovernment.  The court determined that although the contractprovided for return of the progress payments if the project werenot successful, this was not controlling because, through thepayments, Fairchild "was spending the government's money to conductthe research, not its own."     Fairchild appealed, contending the Air Force did not, in fact,fund the research because its right to payment hinged on thesuccess of the research.  Moreover, Fairchild argued that accordingto the Treasury Regulation, research cannot be considered "funded"if (1) payment to the researcher rests upon the success of theresearch, and (2) the researcher keeps "substantial rights in theresearch."  Both parties agreed that Fairchild met the secondprovision.     Regarding the first provision, the government contended thatwhether research is "funded" does not depend on whether, under thecontract, the government has the right not to pay for unsuccessfulresearch.  Rather, the government argued, payment of the researchmust be "unexpected or surprising" in order for the contractor toreceive a tax credit.     The CAFC panel found that the trial court properly determinedthat the availability of the tax credit does not depend on whetherthe researcher is paid; rather, it depends on whether the contractrequires payment upon success of the research.  However, the panelheld that the trial court erred in determining that Fairchild "didnot itself incur" the research expenditures, because Fairchild"received payments under the contract as its research progressed."     Because Fairchild received the progress payments, and itexpected to eventually be paid for the research, the trial courtmistakenly determined that Fairchild's right to payment did nothinge on success as that term is used in the regulation, held thepanel.                    The panel found that the progress payments did not, in fact, ,alter the contract provision that Fairchild was not entitled tokeep any payments if it did not successfully produce the productfor which the payment was sent.  "A progress payment does notcommit the agency to accept unsuccessful performance, or to makefull or partial payment if the product is not successfullyproduced," the panel found.     The government contended that only under "risky and uncertainfixed-price incentive contracts" would the researcher be entitledto the tax credit, and that the availability of the tax creditcannot be determined until the project is over and the degree ofthe researcher's risk of nonpayment is known.     The panel disagreed, holding that Congress designed the tax asan incentive to divert additional resources to research by reducingthe cost of that additional research.  "In harmony with thispurpose, the regulations state that the research agreement must be'entered into prior to the performance of the qualified research,'"noted the panel.     The panel concluded that this "wait and see" view cannot beapplied to Fairchild's contract, because it expressly provides thatthe government may decline payment if the research is notsuccessful; therefore, the research is not "funded."     Arguing for Fairchild was Albert G. Lauber Jr. of Caplin &Drysdale in Washington, DC, with Ralph A. Muoio and Julie W. Davison brief.  Arguing for the government was Steven I. Frahm of theDepartment of Justice, Washington, DC, with Assistant AttorneyGeneral Loretta C. Argrett, Gary R. Allen and Jonathan S.

Continental Insurance Co. v. City of VirginiaBeach, No. 2:95cv212 (ED VA).     The city of Virginia Beach contracted with Utility BuildersInc. to construct water and sewer lines for $1.33 million.Continental Insurance Co. executed a $1.33 million performance andpayment bond in favor of the city.  Utility received periodicpayments totaling $1 million before the city learned the companyhad filed for bankruptcy; the city then declared Utility in defaultand withheld additional progress payments. Before doing so, thecity had not made the inspections and tests called for in thecontract.               The city demanded Continental complete the original contractas the performance bond surety.  Continental hired a consultant toprepare rebid documents, selected a bidder and signed a tri-partyagreement with that contractor and the city.  Numerous defects inUtility's work were found; Continental and the city agreed to sharethe remediation costs. The parties spent $321,563 beyond the $1.33million original contract price.     Continental sued the city to collect $234,828 it paid the newcontractor to correct or complete Utility's work.  Thediversity-based complaint in U.S. District Court for the EasternDistrict of Virginia also sought prejudgment interest, consultingfees and a declaratory judgment absolving Continental of furtherliability under the contract.  The city counterclaimed for $86,736it paid the new contractor for repairs; it also asked forliquidated damages under the contract for late completion of theproject.     After a bench trial, Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. awardedContinental $234,828 plus consulting fees, offset by the city's$86,736 counterclaim.  He denied prejudgment interest and adeclaratory judgment to Continental.  He also denied the city'srequest for liquidated damages.     Under the original contract, the city was required toreasonably test and inspect Utility's work before making payments,but failed to do so, he said, rejecting the city's argument thatthe city had no such duty.  As a result, the city made monthlyprogress payments prematurely to Utility in violation of the city'scontractual obligations, he said.     That material deviation from the contract dischargesContinental from its obligations to the extent it was prejudiced bythe city's failure to test and inspect, he held, adding that thecity's policy encouraged contractors to take the money and run.The premature payments also hurt the surety by significantlydecreasing the money available for the project.     The judge also found inadmissible the city's attempt to offerextrinsic evidence as to custom and usage pertaining toinspections.     He allowed $23,573 in engineering consulting fees asforeseeable expenses after the city's material deviation but deniedprejudgment interest as a matter of discretion, saying both partiesacted in good faith in a bona fide legal dispute.  A declaratoryjudgment was deemed unnecessary.     Continental was represented by Timothy G. Clancy of Cumming,Hatchett, Moschel, Patrick & Clancy in Hampton and by Wendy AnnHartmann and Robert F. Carney of Whiteford, Taylor & Preston inBaltimore.  Charles Bernard Miller and Richard Jay Beaver of thecity attorney's office appeared for Virginia Beach.Back to Headline List CopyrightGOVERNMENT CONTRACT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996ED MI FINDS COUNTYCONTRACTOR NOT LIABLEFOR INDEMNIFICATION     As a matter of public policy and Michigan law, a countycontractor is not obligated to indemnify the county for grossnegligence by county employees, the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court ofAppeals held Dec. 8, overturning summary judgment against acontractor that provided medical services to jail inmates. Caldwellv. Enyeart, No. 94-1406 (ED MI).     Washtenaw County contracted with Correctional Medical ServicesInc. (CMS) to provide medical care to county jail inmates.  Thecontract included a broadly worded indemnification provision.  In1988, Willie Caldwell's mother, an asthmatic inmate, asked CMSemployees and a jail employee to hospitalize her; they failed to doso, and she died the same night.     Caldwell filed a Section 1983 complaint against the county inU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Thecomplaint also alleged gross negligence by county employees andgross negligence and malpractice against CMS and CMS employees.The county cross-claimed against CMS for indemnification.  Thecounty settled with Caldwell, but CMS won at trial on theunderlying claims.     Judge Patrick J. Duggan granted summary judgment in favor ofthe county on the cross-claim, ordering CMS to indemnify the countyfor the settlement and its attorney fees.     The Sixth Circuit reversed in a majority opinion by Judge H.Ted Milburn and remanded the case to determine the nature of thesettlement between the county and Caldwell.     If the settlement included damages for gross negligence bycounty employees, CMS would not be obligated to indemnify thecounty, according to the court.  Caldwell's claims against thecounty included allegations of gross negligence, and both Michiganpublic policy and statutes prohibit preinjury contracts toindemnify a party for its own gross negligence.  On remand, thetrial judge must determine whether the settlement agreementincluded any admission of liability or guilt by the county andcounty employees.     Dissenting, Judge David A. Nelson said the contract languagedoes not provide indemnification for the county's gross negligenceand, therefore, is enforceable under state law.  However, he said,the case should be remanded to determine what proportion of thesettlement and fees were attributable to the conduct of CMSemployees; only that portion is subject to indemnification becauseliability based on the county employees' conduct did not arise fromthe underlying contract.Back to Headline List WT03-B30-33IA059-000323-B007-128http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/de33.html 205.156.212.5 19970114212336 text/html 29377HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 21:21:06 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:21 GMTContent-length: 29190Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/de33.html Sample Issue Copyright MARINE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNet December 15, 1993 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FRONT PAGE NEWS GATT COULD CHILL GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY MARINE R&D COST SHARING (414 words) NAVY SUB CHIEF TOUTS MULTIPLE MISSIONS FOR NEW ATTACK SUB (743 words) RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT ARPA PLANS INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION SIMULATION (125 words) CASE STUDY ROYAL CARIBBEAN INCREASES EFFICIENCY, POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS WITH VMS (481 words) BRIEFS JAPANESE FIRM SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH NEWPORT NEWS SHIPBUILDING (69 words) SIRE PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING (69 words) U.K. BUDGET CUTS SPARE MINEHUNTER ACQUISITION (69 words) U.S., CHINESE FIRMS JOIN TO FORM NEW COMPANY (73 words) TRIMBLE RECEIVES INTERPHASE MARINE PILOT GPS CONTRACT (62 words) FERRANTI-THOMSON TO PROVIDE SONAR ON NEW U.K. SUBMARINE (58 words) ITALIAN-BUILT TAIWANESE RESEARCH VESSEL TO GET NORWEGIAN EQUIPMENT (66 words) COMMUNICATIONS IDB MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS TO OFFER INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO INMARSAT (449 words) FEDERAL PAGE NRL DEVELOPS FIBER-OPTIC MAGNETIC ARRAY SYSTEM (112 words) NSWC ISSUES RFP FOR LOW SIGNATURE MAST (79 words) ENGINEERING SERVICES SOUGHT FOR TORPEDO PROGRAMS (47 words) SHIPPING COORDINATING COMMITTEE TO HOLD PUBLIC MEETING (69 words) CONGRESS DIRECTS DOD TO EQUIP PLATFORMS, WEAPONS WITH GPS (34 words) NUWC ISSUES REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (70 words) CONTRACTS (86 words) NAVAL SYSTEMS ROYAL NORWEGIAN NAVY TESTING NEW MINE COUNTERMEASURE SHIP (193 words) EDITOR'S NOTE (29 words) CopyrightMARINE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetDecember 15, 1993GATT COULD CHILL GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY MARINE R&DCOST SHARING     As international trade negotiations move toward a Dec. 15deadline, lawmakers have told President Clinton that one of theagreement's provisions could endanger between $2 and $3 billiondollars of government assistance each year to industrial researchand development projects.     In a Nov. 19 letter to Clinton, 21 lawmakers--representingboth parties and houses of Congress--noted that the language onresearch subsidies being discussed during the current round ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would "outlaw"technologies resulting from certain types of government-industryR&D partnerships. The letter was released by a bipartisan groupof senators and representatives led by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee technologypanel, and Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.), chairman of the HouseScience, Space and Technology Committee.     As a signatory to the agreement, the U.S. accepts GATT asthe controlling law for international trade.     The GATT language would likely affect the TechnologyReinvestment Program (TRP) for defense conversion and dual-useapplications functioning through the Advanced Research ProjectsAgency and ARPA's new MARITECH program for shipbuildingmodernization.     An aide to Brown said the GATT provision would also captureCooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), throughwhich government and industry have collaborated since the late1980s, affecting "dozens, if not hundreds" of programs.     Specifically, GATT would make illegal technologies fromprojects where a government pays 50 percent of the costs of"basic industrial research" or 25 percent of the costs of"applied industrial research," the letter says.     As it stands, the measure would allow such assistance onlyif companies submitted their plans to a GATT committee foradministrative review, a requirement that might have a "deterrenteffect" on some government-industry partnerships, the lettersays. Also, while the language contains a "defense exception" tothe provision, the Bingaman aide says that its most likelyreading protects weapons systems, not technology programs.     The letter states that ironically, the U.S. government madethe first moves to include research subsidies in the GATT,"apparently aiming at [the European] Airbus and Ariane" consortiafor commercial aircraft and space launches, respectively.     In addition, the openness of the U.S. budget process and thepublic disclosure required of U.S. corporations allows easyaccess to information about government assistance. Other nations,however, "provide the bulk of their assistance to industryindirectly through tax holidays, favorable bank loans, [and]subsidized land...which would not be captured by the [GATT]language," the members' letter says.Back to Headline List CopyrightMARINE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetDecember 15, 1993NAVY SUB CHIEF TOUTS MULTIPLE MISSIONS FOR NEW ATTACK SUB     The Navy's submarine warfare director, highlighting themulti-mission capabilities of the New Attack Submarine (NAS),said the service plans to begin NAS production in 1998 at a costof $1.5 billion per boat.     Rear Adm. Thomas Ryan said Nov. 30 that he held out $1.3billion as a personal objective for the unit cost of NAS, andsaid that program officers are working to reduce construction andlife-cycle costs to meet that figure.     A recent cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA)validated the requirement for "the Navy's submarine for the next40 years," Ryan said at a Naval Submarine League luncheon held inArlington, Va. The Defense Acquisition Board has not yet approveddevelopment of a design for NAS.     Ryan said that he expected to see an NAS about the size of aLos Angeles-class attack sub, displacing between 6,800-7,000tons. The program would build a series of NAS variants, eachvarying somewhat depending on its intended mission. The part ofeach submarine that would be different is the section of the hullin front of the submarine's forward reactor-compartment bulkhead.     Ryan said the COEA for NAS indicated that the Navy wouldhave to procure three of its own diesel-electric subs at a costof almost $2 billion to counter the threat a $1.5-billion NAScould address.     He also said that the Navy would optimize NAS's quieting,speed, and shiphandling, and would modify the advanced-capabilitytorpedo to operate in littoral waters. Also, Ryan said that theQE2, TB-29 towed array, and wide-aperture array sonars, some ofwhich may appear on NAS, will "significantly improve our abilityto detect and quickly target vessels in coastal waters."     Ryan also discussed the role of NAS as a strike platform.     With ballistic missile defense and ship self-defenseincreasingly occupying space on surface combatants, Ryan saidthat he has decided to include 12 vertical-launch systems in theNAS while studying the addition of eight more launchers. Inaddition, Ryan said that an NAS variant might provide the follow-on to current Navy ballistic-missile submarines.Optimizing the NAS Design For Specific Missions     Turning to the future of the entire submarine fleet, Ryannoted that DoD's Bottom-up Review identified submarines as themost effective platform for four specific missions, "for whichthe design of [NAS] will be optimized."     The four missions are:     * Intelligence Collection and Surveillance:  Whilethe Navy has developed super-high-frequency (SHF) and extremely-high-frequency (EHF) antennae for use on subs, Ryan said that theNavy will develop a stealthy sail for the NAS with SHFtransmission capability that supports imagery. This would allow asubmarine to broach the waterline and transmit collected datawithout risking detection.     * Mine Detection: Ryan noted that commanders would feeluneasy committing a large amphibious ship or aircraft carrier toan area not cleared of mines, and that countermine shipsoperating in the littoral could face enemy coastal defenses.     The Submarine Offboard Mine Search System (SOMS), the Navy's"most significant new system for mine detection," will join thefleet by 2003, roughly at the same time as NAS, Ryan said.Deployable from a torpedo tube and tethered by several miles offiber optic cable, SOMS would allow complete coverage of bottomand water-column spaces, he said.     On other technologies facilitating this mission for Navysubs, Ryan cited the minehunting capabilities of the AN/BSY-1sonar deployed on Los Angeles-class boats, the Advanced MineDetection System under development for NAS, and the EXUS sonarbackfit for Los Angeles-class submarines without the BSY-1 sonar.     * Special Operations: "The [NAS] will be designed fromthe start to maximize SOF [special operations force]capabilities," Ryan said, noting plans for a sub  capable ofshallow-water operations and bottoming "in many littoral areas."In addition to providing a dry-deck shelter for delivery of NavySEALs, NAS will have a lock-in/lock-out capability and areconfigurable torpedo room to allow for delivery of swimmers orsupplies through torpedo tubes.     * New Antisubmarine (ASW) Warfare Threats: "Moreand more Third World nations are acquiring diesel submarinessince they are a high threat-to-cost platform against surfaceforces," Ryan said. However, he added that unlike the formerSoviet navy, "most Third World submarines train almostexclusively in [antisurface warfare]. Many don't have an ASWweapon and have little or no training against other dieselsubmarines, much less modern nuclear attack subs."Back to Headline List CopyrightMARINE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetDecember 15, 1993ARPA PLANS INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION SIMULATION     The Advanced Research Projects Agency's Maritime SystemsTechnology Office is seeking information on an IntermodalTransportation Simulation Initiative.

But despite tough economic times, companies like RoyalCaribbean Cruise Lines, which currently uses Sperry Marine Inc.'sVMS on three of its cruise ships and has plans to integrate thesystem on two new constructions, are willing to invest in suchsystems because of the increased safety and efficiency that canbe derived from them.     Designed to be used on virtually any vessel, from 80 footluxury yachts to aircraft carriers, Royal Caribbean uses VMSbecause, "it makes it easier to get hold of information in onelocation. You don't have to look at a lot of screens orinstruments to find vital information," Roar Molvig, MarineSuperintendent of Royal Caribbean, told MARINE TECHNOLOGY NEWS.     But that's not the only reason Royal Caribbean purchasedSperry's VMS.     "Based on their technology and very much the price -- theywere very competitive in the market -- [Royal Caribbean decided]they seemed to have what we needed," Molvig said.     As well as providing the watch officer with specificinformation on where the ship is and where it's going, VMS uses aGlobal Positioning System to provide information on where theship is relative to such potential hazards as channel boundariesin a harbor.     VMS also assimilates input from ships' radar and is able tosuperimpose on electronic charts the positions of "other shipsout there that [the watch officer] may have a concern with,"according to Frank Soccoli, Commercial Marketing Manager forSperry Marine.More Effective Conning Time     The VMS also increases the efficient use of the watchofficer's time. "The centralized information certainly canenhance the operation of the bridge and also the safety, therebymaking it more efficient," Molvig noted.     "To some degree we get a financial return by having theinformation about the ship's position," Molvig added. Knowingthis information makes a ship "open to savings" because it allowsthe watch officer to more effectively determine appropriaterouting. He can also calculate the speed the engines need to workat to meet the requirements of the voyage plan most efficiently,Molvig explained.     There are two main reasons a shipowner would want to use aVMS system, Soccoli said. The first is safety: the watch officerat all times is aware of the ship's surroundings and any objectswhich may get in its path.     In addition to making the crews more safe, however, Soccolinoted that "a lot of owners are looking at trying to maximizeefficiency through effective manning." Depending on the company,a bridge crew may consist of two or three people. Sperry's VMSsatisfies all international classification group "One Man Bridge"guidelines for navigation equipment, meaning ships using Sperry'sVMS in international waters only require a one man watch.Back to Headline List CopyrightMARINE TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetDecember 15, 1993JAPANESE FIRM SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH NEWPORT NEWS SHIPBUILDING     Inshikawajima Harima Heavy Industries and Newport NewsShipbuilding in late November signed a technical cooperationagreement which presumably will increase Newport News'competitiveness in commercial shipbuilding.

The coststructure is at least $4 cheaper than the lowest rates charged bythe International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), a70-country consortium based in London that now provides phoneservice to ships.  Inmarsat's costs range from $5.50 to $10 perminute.     The new service, called Oceancell, will use the AmericanMobile Satellite Corp. (AMSC) satellite, scheduled for launch inlate 1994.     IDB Mobile's vice president of sales, John Marra, saidvessels trading in the inland waters and the Gulf of Mexico willbe able to "utilize high quality satellite communications, usinga mobile phone number and [will] receive a single bill." Thecompany estimates that ships calling on U.S. ports will spendmore than 25 percent of their voyage within Oceancell's coveragearea. The new service, the company said, will meet "substantialpent-up demand" for cost-competitive satellite service.     The satellite to be used by Oceancell is scheduled to belaunched in about a year by American Mobile Satellite Corp.(AMSC), a privately held company based in Reston, Va. AMSC is thefederally licensed provider of mobile satellite services to theU.S. market. IDB Mobile and AMSC have signed a value-addedservice provider agreement under which IDB will service to themaritime industry.     The AMSC bird will cover nearly all of North America.Service will generally be available within 200 miles of thecoast.  The Hawaiian Islands will be similarly served, thecompany said. Users will be able to place calls anywhere in theworld. IDB Mobile said most tugs, barges, fishing and offshoresupply vessels will be in range of the Oceancell service at alltimes. The service also will provide fax, data and GPScapabilities.Equipment Price To Range From $3,000 To $4,000     To use the new service, vessels will need a smalltransceiver and an antenna unit. The satellite's power will allowsmaller antennas to be used at reduced costs. The system willcome with its own handset, with prices ranging from $3,000 to$4,000 depending on features and antenna type. Westinghouse andMitsubishi both are licensed to build phones for the Oceancellservice.     IDB said it will use Oceancell to complete its secondgeneration of mobile services.  This summer, customers will beable to use the company's Inmarsat M service in all four oceanregions at a cost of $5 per hour or less.

The vessel is the first of four "Oskoy" class minecountermeasure vessels being constructed for the RNoN byNorwegian shipbuilder Kvaerner Mandal, which also has an RNoNcontract for a further five "Alta" class mine sweepers.     The design of the new vessel, known as a "75 percent aircushion borne surface effect ship," requires strict weightdiscipline by the builder, according to Kvaerner. Application ofthe surface effect configuration offers several key advantages,according to Bore Norland, an official with Kvaerner, includingshock protection offered by the air cushion, and the placement ofall vibration-sensitive equipment above the waterline.     The design means both crew and hardware are less exposed tounderwater explosions.     The vessel was constructed at Kvaerner's purpose-builtfacilities, which have been specifically designed to build bothcivilian and military high-performance vessels.

An Army source tells MFON that advanced procurement fundingfor the NLOS FOG-M program was deleted for FY '91 and added thatit will suffer budget decrements in fiscal 1992 and 1993.  Fiscal1991 procurement of the NLOS system is currently set at $131.2million.     The source also disclosed that the advanced procurement cutscould result in an NLOS FOG-M procurement slip of six months toone year.     A spokesman at the Army Missile Command in Huntsville, Ala.,could not confirm whether NLOS FOG-M advanced procurement fundingfor FY '91 had been nixed but said that if this happens theprogram schedule will slip.     The FY '90 defense budget provides $129.4 million inengineering development for the FOG-M program and $32.5 millionin advanced procurement.     The reason for the advanced procurement funding cut,according to one Army source, is that the Army's Air DefenseSchool in Fort Bliss, Texas, "felt it was more important that themoney go for other air defense programs.  They could live withbudget decrements in the early years of the program and theprogram would still go ahead; it would just inconvenience them."     The Air Defense School is the prime proponent for the NLOSair defense application and has responsibility for establishingthe Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) requirementsfor the system.     According to the industry sources, the Army has determinedfor the moment that it is going to emphasize the Martin Marietta-developed Air Defense Anti-Tank System (ADATS) over the NLOS forthe anti-helicopter role in the Army's Forward Area Air DefenseSystem (FAADS).  They said that the Army will develop and testthe fiber optic guided-missile technology but that the servicedoes not intend to procure or field this particular weaponsystem.     Last December an industry team consisting of Boeing MilitaryAirplanes and Hughes Aircraft Co. won a 43-month $125 millioncontract for full-scale engineering development of the NLOSsystem.  Current Army plans call for the eventual deployment of18 systems per air defense battalion.NLOS Associate Proponency Undecided     A decision made in late August by Lt. Gen. Leonard Wishartof TRADOC to establish associate proponency for the NLOS FOG-Mcombined arms system at the Army's Field Artillery School at FortSill, Okla., (MFON, Sept. 8, 1989), was revisited by TRADOCCommander Gen. John W. Foss, according to an Army source, whosaid Foss has put off a final decision on associate proponency.He noted that the final decision will at the least "await theresults of the NLOS Concept Evaluation Program (CEP)" of which adraft is due on Jan. 15.  He added that the outcome on proponencyis unclear due to "all the budget cuts and turmoil" associatedwith projected defense spending reductions.     For the past year the Army's Combined Arms Center, FortLeavenworth, Kan., has been conducting the CEP which is aimed atstudying ways to integrate the air defense and groundapplications of FOG-M, including feasibility of its combined armsmission.     If associate proponency is established, this could doublethe size of the NLOS FOG-M program," Army sources told MFON inSeptember (MFON, Sept. 8, 1989).  If FOG-M is procured for fieldartillery battalions, up to 36 systems could be deployed witheach of these units.  There are 16 divisions in the Army and eachhas a field artillery and air defense battalion.Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY FIBER OPTICS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1990MOSBACHER BACKS TRANS-SOVIET FIBER LINK     Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has endorsed U.S.participation in a proposed international effort to lay a fiberoptic communications line across the Soviet Union if thetechnology involved is not the most sophisticated available.  Hesaid recently that technology that is five to 10 years old couldbe approved for transfer.     Mosbacher's comments follow a recent warning by FrankGaffney, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclearforces and arms control, that the proposed fiber line linkingJapan, the Soviet Union and Europe would greatly improve theSoviet telephone network and consequently enhance militarycommand, control and communications (MFON, Dec. 15, 1989).Gaffney also said the fiber link would make it more difficult forU.S. intelligence agencies to monitor Soviet strategic militarycommunications.     Talk within the Executive Branch about relaxing exportcontrols for Eastern Europe has reached the highest levels.President Bush said just before Christmas that "it's timely totake a new look at some of the commercial constraints."  AndLawrence S. Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, said inNovember that "we and our COCOM partners want to signal our clearwillingness to respond constructively to the democratizationunder way in Eastern Europe."     The Defense Department, a key player in any decision onrelaxing high-technology export controls to Eastern Europe, hasnot publicly made a stand on the Soviet fiber optic link issue oron any recent comments by government officials expressing awillingness to relax technology export control to East Europeancountries.  A Pentagon spokesman tells MFON that DoD does notpublicly comment on interagency issues and is not likely to onthese.     Transfer of the fiber optic technology to the Soviet Unionis currently prohibited by the Coordinating Committee onMultilateral Export Controls (COCOM) and would need U.S.government approval to take place.  COCOM approval is seen asless difficult than U.S. approval because Western Europe, Japanand Australia have historically been less resistant to technologytransfer than the United States.     U S West International, the U.S. participant in the plannedinternational effort, is expected to make a formal applicationfor the project this month.U.S. Planning To Ease Technology Export Controls     In response to the rapidly changing political landscape inEastern Europe, the Bush administration is examining plans toease export controls on advanced computers and telecommunicationsequipment to East European countries, Mosbacher said recently.He added that special exceptions for Poland and Hungary mightalso be worked out because these two have formed non-communistgovernments.     The Commerce secretary said that Polish and Hungarianofficials have said they would carefully manage the transfer ofWestern high-technology exports to their countries to prevent theretransfer of that technology and to safeguard any technologies.Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY FIBER OPTICS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1990DCA BEGINS USING COAX AND FIBER-BASED LAN     The Headquarters of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA,Arlington, Va.) has begun using an IEEE 802.3 standard ethernetlocal area network (LAN) based on thick and thin coax Ethernetcable and fiber optic cable for connectivity between servers andthe customer base, the Agency has announced.     According to the DCA, the "fiber optic cable provides intra-building connectivity, and thick Ethernet cable provides inter-building connectivity.  Thin Ethernet currently providesconnectivity from workstations to the media access controllers."     The announcement also said that the LAN provides E-Mail,calendaring, user-shared text processing and access to the DCAWang hosts.  "With this robust mail capability LAN users cancontact approximately 1,500 DEA personnel in the National CapitalRegion and the Acquisition Management Directorate at Scott, AFB,Ill."     A DCA official told MFON last week that the Agency plans tohave implemntation of the LAN at the DCA Headquarters completedthis month and will install a LAN at a DCA complex in Reston,Va., this summer.  He added that DCA is looking into installingthe same LAN at its office complex in Europe.     The LAN was designed and installed by the Army's InformationSystems Engineering Command, Fort Ritchie, Md.  And according tothe DCA, the LAN is "part of an overall networking project thatincludes the installation of a broadband cable plant."     Eventually, video distribution at the DCA Headquarters willbe carried over this broadband cable.  (DCA, 8th & SouthCourthouse Road, Arlington, VA  22204.  Bev Sampson, 202/692-2006.)Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY FIBER OPTICS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1990IDA ANALYST SEES JAPAN DOMINATING FUTURE FOG MARKET     Japanese firms are spending a lot of money on theirproduction base to build fiber optic material and component partsfor use in fiber optic gyroscopes (FOGs) in order to positionthemselves to capture a large share of the eventual marketplacefor this technology, John P. McHale, an analyst with theInstitute of Defense Analyses (IDA), said recently.     Speaking to the Washington (D.C.) Section of The Instituteof Navigation last month, the former Navy official said that "theJapanese are spending out the door" for research and development(R&D) on FOGs.  In an interview with MFON last month, McHalesaid, "In my opinion, unless we control the market and obtainadequate funding and have a U.S. capability, what's going tohappen is other nations are going to come in and invest money inthe technology, and Japan is doing it already, to become thedominant supplier for high-quality, relatively low-cost fiberoptic material."     McHale said that the United States cannot afford to have anational R&D capability in fiber optics unless "we have aproduction and manufacturing base.  And we cannot have aproduction base unless we have a national economic base on whichit is built."  He described the economic base as being the"demands, requirements, funding and long-term tax advantages forcompanies to invest money into the product."     McHale's views are not without foundation.  He retired fromthe Naval Air Systems Command in February 1988 where he was incharge of the Gyro and Inertial Systems Section for 20 years.  Inaddition to his work at IDA, he is also a consultant to severalfirms and chairman of the Critical Technologies Technical WorkingGroup (TWG) for Inertial Systems (4B) and of the Magnetometersand Magnetic Gradiometers TWG (4E).  McHale has also beensupporting the Pentagon in the drafting of technical proposalsfor U.S. negotiating positions for COCOM.What Must The U.S. Do?     Why are the Japanese showing such promise in the area ofFOGS and high-technology in general and what must the UnitedStates do to make sure its firms capture at least a significantshare of the FOG market?  According to McHale, in Japancentralized leadership for applying new technologies is providedby the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) whichhelps Japanese firms plan long term, find product applicationsand market overseas.     He pointed out that there is no parallel in the UnitedStates to MITI.     "The long-term plan of any U.S. fiber optic company is zeroto five years," McHale said.  On the other hand, "MITI's long-term plan is 250 years," McHale said, "and they have veryadvanced planning in terms of technological and manufacturingproduction capability and a masterplan for it at a nationwidelevel."     While the U.S. government does not necessarily have toinvest money into FOG R&D, McHale said, it must at least showleadership in determining standards for the technology "so thatnot all our companies are going off in 13 different directionswithout a national plan.  U.S. companies are each going their ownway; They can't compete by themselves."     In his speech McHale also pointed to the need for adifferent tax structure for the U.S. industrial base thatprovides incentives for investing.     Concerning the current state of Japanese FOG technology, theanalyst said that he is not aware of any working fiber gyroscopesin Japan today.  He said that the Japanese are concentratingtheir efforts on the production base to build the material forFOG and added that "devices will come next."     Industry officials in the United States whose firms aredeveloping fiber gyros have told MFON in the past that themilitary currently represents the most likely near term marketfor the FOG technology.  However, these sources say the militaryhas not expressed any commitment toward buying this technologyand express concern that any applications for it may be years offif the military does not move to procure FOGs soon.     Asked about U.S. industry's concerns here, McHale pointedout that Japanese firms, through the help of MITI, will find thenecessary economic base for fiber gyros by applying them in asmany product lines as possible.  He said the Japanese will buildsmall and inexpensive FOGs for automobiles, trucks, police andemergency vehicles as well as for other vehicles and vessels.For such applications, he said, the gyros would serve stabilityand control and navigation functions.     The problem, McHale said, is not in the U.S. labs, it is howto get the technology out of the laboratory.  "The Japanese labwork has duplicated a lot of what we do.  So when we drop outbecause there is no short-term profit, the Japanese will pick upwhere we leave off.  They are in it for the long-term," heconcluded.Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY FIBER OPTICS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1990DOD `TREMENDOUS NEED' FOR TACTICAL DEVELOPMENT OF FIBER, NEWSTUDY SAYS     Companies involved with the development and manufacture offiber optic technology that do not anticipate entering thetelecommunications market will find a significant military marketfor the tactical development of fiber optic technology, arecently released study entitled "Fiber Optics in the Militaryand Communications Markets" says.     Prepared by S&W Associates of Bethesda, Md., the studyforecasts sea-based fiber optic applications increasing from $10million last year to about $72 million in 1994.     And S&W predicts a six-fold increase in the growth rate forfiber optic avionics applications between 1989 and 1994.Specifically, the study sees these applications, such as fiberoptic flight controls and high-speed data buses, either in newweapons systems or as upgrades to existing platforms in each offour military services.     Electronic Warfare, command, control, communication andintelligence (C3I) and navigation are areas seen in the studythat will be receiving funding emphasis within the mililtary.     Taking into account that the Defense Department facesbudgets with "very little, if any, real growth," S&W notesseveral other economic considerations impacting future marketgrowth for fiber in the military.  Because a lot of DoD money istied up in existing contracts, the study says opportunities toemploy fiber optics and related components either in new weaponssystems or to modernize existing ones, "will require demonstratedcapabilities and/or greater investment with a higher degree ofrisk in regard to an adequate return on the investment."     Concerning spending trends within DoD on fiber optictechnologies that are already being used, "priority interest" isprojected for the following:  "Wide bandwidth distributedinformation and image processing; secure, TEMPEST certified LANsand related processing systems; and, modernization of basetelecommunications systems."     The Bethesda-based analysts see even more intensecompetition ahead within the military fiber optic market due to aslowdown in the commercial market and because "defensecontractors will be compelled to exploit future fiber optictechnology by finding not only the highest quality systemcomponents at a reasonable cost but also by foreseeing andsatisfying requirements arising from ongoing military efforts."And the study foresees the cost of replacing copper cable withfiber cable on existing systems as potentially prohibitive.

At the time, Bell officials said the agreementsrepresent the "first known commitment of FOG technology to theproduction floor."     The official noted that "the Air Force may have left us outof the workshop because they were not aware that we are a newplayer in the [FOG] game."

The defense authorization budget vetoed by President Clintoncontained $23 million for the short range system; $26.8 millionfor the tactical drone, a $10 million cut; $45.3 million forPredator a $25.3 million boost; the $117 million request for theTier Two Plus system; and $66 million for the Tier ThreeMinus, an $18 million hike.     For the TRW Inc.-Israel Aircraft Industries Inc. Huntershort range drone, acquisition czar Paul Kaminski is expected tosign at any time a order terminating further Hunter production,maintain eight aircraft and ground equipment at Ft. Hood and lessthan a full system at Ft. Huachuca for training and doctrine. Therest will be put in storage for attrition.     According to a Jan. 5 Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office(DARO) document titled "UAV Information Update," some details arestill being worked out. "Joint Staff has taken issue with thedeployment of Hunter beyond the one system and the use ofadditional attrition vehicles out of storage," it said."DARO continues to work the funding color of money issue with theArmy and the Navy."     And the Army has stopped recruiting soldiers and told Ft.Huachuca,  Ariz., to shutter scheduled training classes,according to the Sierra Vista Herald. Tactical UAV     After years of delay, the release of a draft request forproposals for the tactical drone program was expected to bereleased Jan. 10 (solicitation No. N00019-93-R-0010). A notice inthe Dec. 28 Commerce Business Daily said a final RFP will bereleased Jan. 24.     According to the notice, the system should cost $350,000 forthe 33rd air vehicle and sensor. The 100th air vehicle and sensorshould cost $300,000. The program has also been attributedAdvanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) status. ACTDsare reasonably mature systems that will be put into soldiershandsand will be made available for contingency operations.     The ACTD plan is to buy six tactical systems, two mobilemaintenance facilities and eight attrition air vehicles andmodular mission payloads (MMP video and infrared sensors). Therewill also be a low-rate initial production option for six moresystems, two MMPs and eight attrition vehicles and MMPs.     The requirements call for 200 kilometer range, three hourbasic operation, to be upgraded to four, less than 100 metertarget location error and launch and recovery from unpreparedsurfaces and large deck amphibious ships. Upgrades would addautomatic takeoff and landing and a heavy fuel engine. Payloadupgrades would include a synthetic aperture radar. Thesystems will be carried aboard a single C-130 (four air vehiclesand ground equipment) and be transported on the ground by twoHumvees with a trailer.      Oklahoma Republican lawmakers are concerned about thisprogram's future. A Dec. 4 letter from Sens. James Inhofe and DonNickles and Rep. J.C. Watts expressed concern that the systemshould carry a heavy fuel engine. They also advised the prototypesystem be already demonstrated and available. Regarding the navyrequirement, they suggested a vertical takeoff and landingsystem. They also advised that the target location error be lessthan 100 meters.     Endurance UAVs     The Predator medium-altitude UAV has had some success in theBosnia theater and war games. A new sensor, a synthetic apertureradar, has now been added. Integration of a vehicle has beencompleted and a second system is being flight checked, accordingto the aforementioned DARO document. Training on the radar willbegin at Ft. Huachuca, Ariz., on Jan. 16.     Predator has also been used in conjunction with a aircraftcarrier battle group for the first tie in late November to earlyDecember, according to a December Navy memo.     For the Tier Three Minus system, a first flight is scheduledfor Jan. 27, according to the DARO document. And regarding theTier Two Plus, a major design review is slated for Jan. 29 toFeb. 1.     As endurance drones become more important to Pentagon plans,UAV Joint Projects Office officials are concerned that their roleas developer and procurement center may be usurped by the AirForce. After years of treating UAVs like poor relatives, it hasset up a drone squadron to handle endurance vehicles and a systemprogram office to manage them.     Air Force officials are also interested in the AdvancedResearch Projects Agency s Unmanned Tactical Aircraft programexamining robot jet fighters and bombers.Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY ROBOTICS via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996MILITARY ROBOTS EXPECTED IN BOSNIA BY APRIL     Of all the Pentagon s robot vehicle programs, unmannedground vehicles (UGV) have always been the runt of the litter.But its status may be changing due to increased interest inanti-mine operations for which the systems are seen by many as agodsend.     For a case in point, the UGV Joint Joint Program Office, theArmy and contractors are preparing to send in April fourdifferent types of robotic strap-on kits to Bosnia to turn mannedvehicles into remote control systems, said a knowledgeablesource.     The engineer vehicles will perform a variety of tasks, butthe most important is mine clearing. The area holds an estimatedthree million mines.     The systems to be sent include the Panther, an M-60 tankminus turret; Badger, based on a five-ton truck and Humvee;Miniflail, a skid-steer loader with a chain flail; and Pointman,currently based on the Westinghouse  Hazard Avoidance andReconnaissance Extender (HARE) II six-wheeled robotchassis. The number of systems being sent is classified, thesource said.      Contractors involved include Omnitech Robotics (Panther andBadger), Lockheed Martin Corp. (Miniflail) and Westinghouse(Pointman).     "There s a big push to get them over there in time for thespring thaw," said the source.     The Ft. Leonard Wood, Mo.-based Army Engineer School RoboticTechnology Insertion Activity is helping to construct new systemsand planning mobile training and logistics for the systems.     The UGV master plan released in October calls for spending about$260 million on the robots through fiscal 2001. Besides theengineering vehicles the plan also funds the Tactical UnmannedGround Vehicle, Remote Excavation Vehicle System and the RemoteOrdnance Neutralization System.     And along with mine warfare an increasingly importantapplication is security, and the Mobile Detection AssessmentResponse System for interior and exterior applications enjoyssupport in the services and Congress.     In addition, the Army is prepared to approve an OperationalRequirements Document for the remote control strap-on systemsafter the service formally accepts the Vehicle TeleoperationMission Needs Statement later this month, said a service source. Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY ROBOTICS via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996NAVY MOVING OUT ON UNDERWATER ROBOTICS PROJECTS     In fiscal 1996 the Navy is preparing to move out on advancedunmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) projects. Such systems could beworth billions of dollars over the next ten to twenty years, saidindustry sources. According to a just-unclassified version of theUUV master plan, "Clandestine mine reconnaissance is the Navy stop UUV priority."     The other applications include surveillance, intelligencecollection, tactical oceanography, special warfare,counter-narcotics and counter terrorism.     Special Operations forces are also keen on such systems andhave requested an Advanced Technology Demonstration toinvestigate the performance of miniature UUVs such as thosemeasuring six inches in diameter and 52 inches long for shallowwater operations, said the plan.     At the center of Navy UUV activities is the Near-term MineReconnaissance System (NMRS). Last year a Westinghouse ElectricCo.-Lockheed Martin Corp. team won a contract to design, build,test and support the system, based on a classified Westinghouserobot.     It will detect, classify and accurately locate mines. Therobot will be launched and recovered from a 688-class nuclearsubmarine. Deployment is pegged for fiscal 1997.     The so-called "interim operational requirement" calls forone system, consisting of two UUVs, launch and recovery equipmentand shipboard command and control and support equipment. Itsoperational life will be six years.     Not only is the vehicle to use existing Westinghousehardware, the sensors will also be built from existing designsused on the classified demonstration system, said the plan. Inaddition, "The command and control consoles and the launch andrecovery subsystem built for the demonstration system will berefurbished for the operational prototype system," the plan said.     Now the Navy is pushing the next stage, the Long-term MineReconnaissance System (LMRS). The request for proposals for thesystem is expected to be released in the Spring, said the Navy.Milestone I, concept definition, is expected to be achieved thisfiscal year. Deployment would begin in 2003.     The service is offering data on the system over the Internetand will hold a classified biddersconference on the robot Jan. 31at Johns Hopkins University in Laurel, Md.      The Navy late last month released new information on LMRSrequirements. "LMRS will capitalize and build on the conceptexploration and definition efforts supported by Congress andexecuted for the Submarine Offboard Mine Search System...which iscanceled," said the plan.     A Cost and Operational Effectiveness Analysis (COEA) hasbeen launched and will investigate three vehicle diameters, 21inches, 36 inches and 54 inches. Also to be studied are threelaunch and recovery options including torpedo tube, dry deckshelter and wet dock. LMRS will be launched and recovered fromSSN688, 688I and NSSN submarines.     Overall, the COEA will identify various task areas. Theseinclude scenarios involving attack submarines; measures ofeffectiveness and performance; threat mine types; offboardvehicle alternatives organic to the submarine and available after2005; and models and simulations. Leading the COEA is JohnsHopkinsJohn Bennedict, COEA director for the Submarine OffboardMine Search System. Among the LMRS operations to be consideredinclude scenarios in the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula, theFar East and Korean Peninsula and Russia. Operators would includeNaval Expeditionary Forces conducting naval or amphibiousoperations and submarines performing singular missions.Missions would include finding safe passages without compromisingsubmarine stealth. Mine threats would include moored and bottommines. LMRS Requirements     The Navy has also revealed a number of broad requirementconsiderations depending on applications. They include:     o Clandestine operations: LMRS should be stealthy and usestandard SSN communications links in accepted anti-mine warfarereporting formats.     o Exploratory mine reconnaissance: the robot would becapable of detecting bottom and other objects and classifyingthem. The system should be able to find safe routes or operatingareas for naval forces.     o Support multiple ship operations: LMRS should be able tosupport a wide array of naval force operations, not just its hostship.     o Single ship operational support: UUV installation,operation and performance should not hinder SSN operations andmissions.     o Early reconnaissance: the robot should be capable ofdeployment to forward sites prior to hostilities and naval forcebuild-up. "Under normal conditions, the system will be routinelydeployed aboard CONUS [continental United States] SSNs beingforward deployed," said the Navy s just-released June 7, 1995,LMRS Top-Level Requirements document. The UUV should be rapidlydeployed at forward sites in an emergency.     o Required functions: the LMRS should be self-powered andself-propelled and capable of operating at variable depths.Reverse propulsion may be necessary for launch and recoveryoperations. For the sensors at a minimum they should detectobjects and provide enough information for characterization ordiscrimination without further sensing.     The navigation suite should allow the UUV to locate theposition of detected objects in a geodetic reference frame,relocate and rendezvous with the SSN mother ship after a sortieand conduct maneuvers in real-time along reconnaissance plans,including reacquisition of previously detected targets.     The Top-Level Requirements document also said LMRS shouldinclude automated launch and recovery. Both autonomous andsemi-autonomous operations will be considered.     Some specific design parameters include for deep water depthof 600 feet, temperature 11.5 degrees Celsius, salinity of 35ppt, density of 1.027 gallons per centimeters squared, sandybottoms, sound velocity of 1,500 meters per second and sea statetwo. The nominal UUV search altitude would be 100 feet above thebottom. The nominal altitude for object identification is 30 feetto 50 feet above the bottom.     For shallow water, the parameters include water depth of 100feet, temperature of 22 degrees Celsius, salinity of 36 ppt,density of 1.025 gallons per cubic centimeter, sandy bottom,sound velocity of 1,522 meters per second, sea state two, 30 feetabove the bottom for nominal search altitude and 30 feet to 50feet above the bottom for identification altitude.     The mine threats the UUV will be used to detect includebottom-type, close-tethered and deep volume. There is norequirement for LMRS to detect or classify tethered near-surfacemines, floating or buried mines.     Installation of LMRS aboard a submarine will be temporaryand not excessively impact boat operations and missions. Butaccording to the Navy requirements document, "some offload ofweapons will be necessary to accommodate the command, control andreplenishment elements of the system."     In addition, there is no requirement for LMRS operations tobe compatible with SSN towed array operations. But speed, headingand depth considerations on the mother ship will be necessary forselected LMRS operation periods, said the document. At a minimumsuch periods will include UUV launch and recovery and homing anddocking.     The Navy has established two design cost goals for a six toseven years of $143 million and $214 million in then-yeardollars. A single system would include two UUVs.

Perry and Director of Central Intelligence John M. Deutch agreed late last month to the shape and scope of the long awaited but oft-delayed Joint Space Management Board (JSMB).      In an agreement signed Dec. 13th, Perry and Deutch established the JSMB as a "board of directors" for defense and intelligence-related U.S. space programs. The board will provide executive management for the various military and civilian-controlled space programs with intel functions, as well as direct oversight of the newly created National Space Architect post.      The board's first task is to integrate policy, requirements, architectures, acquisition strategies and funding needs.**DoD, CIA to share leadership roles      The Pentagon announced direction of the board will be provided by a co-chairmanship of Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology Paul G. Kaminski and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet.      This management team will be backed by an executive committee empowered to act by the secretary of Defense and the director of Central Intelligence, giving it broad executive powers within the charter of the JSMB. That committee will be comprised of the two co-chairs, plus the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the executive director, Intelligence Community Affairs.**Part of a three-phase reorganization      The DoD had previously placed the formation of the JSMB as the third element of a reorganization plan for defense space programs.     In the first phase, an undersecretary of Defense for Space was created Dec. 10, 1994. Consolidations of space requirements and acquisition plans began last year under that new office, now held by former Capitol Hill staffer Bob Davis.      Next Kaminski's office created a Space Architect post to be responsible for acquisitions for military space programs, from satellites and ground elements to launchers. Last fall that post was filled by Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Dickman.     While Dickman and Davis report to Kaminski, Davis remains in overall charge of U.S. military space policy. With the JSMB in place, a new defense space use directive and a National Security Policy for Space are expected to emerge this year.      Space chief Davis told Military Space last fall that new policy documents were in preparation and constituted his first priorities, along with program consolidations. **Details of JSMB membership      Other JSMB members include the Pentagon's controller; Vice Chief of Staff of the Army; Vice Chief of Naval Operations; Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force; Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps; the acquisition executives of the Army, Navy and Air Force; Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control Communications and Intelligence; Director, Program Analysis and Evaluation; Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Space; Commander-in-Chief U.S. Space Command.     Also Executive Director Central Intelligence Agency; and the directors, National Security Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, Defense Intelligence Agency, National Imagery and Mapping Agency (ex-officio until agency is formally established by act of Congress), and director, Bureau of Intelligence and Research Dept. of State.**Charter lays out specifics      Other details of the JSMB charter as agreed to by Perry and Deutch include:     * Overall policy and program guidance for defense and intelligence space programs, including review function and approval of all trade-offs among requirements, programs and resources.     * Review and approval of all defense and intelligence space policies, architectures and program plans for consistency with current JSMB policy and program guidance.      * Develop and make recommendations regarding defense and intelligence space program budget matters to the Expanded Defense Resources Board.     * Establishment the integration of defense and intelligence space architectures under a single National Security Space Architect, with authority to design implementation of programs and architectures.     * Provide recommendations to the secretary of Defense and the director of Central Intelligence on any issue with impact upon defense and intelligence space programs or other such matters as referred to it by either the secretary of Defense or the director of Central Intelligence.     * Provides authority to establish Integrated Product Teams as deemed necessary to accomplish its functions.     * Authority via the co-chairs or at the request of any member to call meetings, but at least quarterly.Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY SPACE via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996A Milspace Policy BriefDefining Missile Defense: What missile, which defense?     President Clinton's veto of the fiscal year 1996 Defense Authorization bill, which the Congress failed to override last week, was focused on accelerated funding for a National Missile Defense (NMD).      The White House said that, in addition to being unnecessary, NMD was a potential violation to START agreements.**Bill increases funding     Under the bill, funding for ballistic missile defense research, development and testing would soar to more than $3 billion, a massive $598.9 million increase over the Clinton administration's requested $2.44 billion. That high- point in missile defense history would mark the first time the Ballistic Missile Defense Office budget request was either fully funded or increased.      Of the $3 billion, some $820 million -- a $450 million increase -- will go for acceleration of NMD "at the earliest possible date," in about four to six years, the bill said. Clinton objected to this provision.**Senate boosts SMTS schedule     While the House increased missile defense funding, the Senate poured more funds into missile tracking. The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $249 million in FY 1996 monies for the Space and Missile Tracking System program, formerly Brilliant Eyes.      The SMTS is the low-Earth orbit segment of the Space-based Infrared Sensor System. The programs are part of the NMD. The Senate committee also boosted funding for cruise missile programs, and called for the establishment of a Cruise Missile Defense (CMD) Initiative.      The bill called on Defense Secretary William Perry to ensure existing air defense systems "are upgraded to improve capabilities" against cruise missiles. Perry was also directed by the Senate to make CMD a priority to support deployment of future systems that are effective against advanced and stealth cruise missiles.      The initiative must lay out a comprehensive plan of organizational changes within DoD that could strengthen CMD activities. But within the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies, and the Washington policy establishment, the issue of what type of missile threat -- what ballistic missile system with what attributes and coming from what geographic threat arena -- has come to the forefront of the missile defense debate: What missile? Which defense? And if the United States faces near-term ICBM threats, is the technology available to provide protection?**Core of the debate     At the center of the debate are two issues: what is the nature of the threat(s) facing the United States, and what kind of defensive system could or should, if any, be deployed as counter measures?      On the issue of the existence or emergence of a new strategic threat, two wholly different views are held by many who frame the issue.      One view holds that the threat of ballistic missiles is a real and growing one, with a cast of rogue nations racing toward early deployments and searching the world's arms markets for the most advanced technology available. The other, sees a minimal threat from any Third World missile deployments, which such a view finds is not the most likely delivery system for nuclear weapons in any case. And, where such weapons already exist or are likely to be developed, this view finds development and deployment of a strategic defense system facing unsolved technical risk and uncertain countermeasures -- and cost.     To put the issue of missile threats and defenses in focus, Military Space here details the work of two groups that have exhaustively researched the subject, the Missile Defense Study Team of the Heritage Foundation and the scientist members of the Union of Concerned Scientists.      In this part, we will look at the missile threat; in part II the types of defenses proposed and how space elements are factored in each scenario.**I. What Missile?     The Heritage study looked at the existing documentation from unclassified and grey-literature sources. The team concluded that ballistic missiles "represent a major threat to civilian populations and military forces."      To back up that claim, the team reviewed the CIA's 1995 report of its Nonproliferation Center. That report stated 20 nations, by conservative estimate, currently have or are developing weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems.      Half of these nations, the CIA reported, were in the Middle East and South Asia. Five countries, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria, posed the greatest danger to the West based on what the agency described as "the aggressive nature of their weapons programs."      All five nations either had ballistic missiles or were in the process of developing them.     This program of missile deployment was proceeding so briskly, the Heritage team said, through a combination of indigenous technology development as well as the purchase of space launch vehicles for reportedly civil uses. Much of the technology of payload launchers has applications to carry weapons such as warhead reentry vehicles. In addition, the flight hardware of space boosters and ballistic missiles were common to each other. **A viable missile threat?      The Union of Concerned Scientists also looked at the emergence of the rogue missile threat. But as summarized in a July 7, 1995 letter to the members of the Senate, the Union's scientists said that the threat of foreign missiles "do not justify deployment of national missile defenses." The group said that it found no nation currently hostile to the United States "possesses ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States."      The Union listed four types of potential ballistic missile attacks that should be addressed. They consisted of accidental launch of Russian or Chinese ICBMs, a deliberate nuclear attack by Russia or China, deliberate attack by another country or a deliberate missile attack by a terrorist organization. In all cases, the Union determined a deployed NMD system as "not an appropriate or effective response" to counter such threats.      The Heritage group did not agree. It found the evidence of missile development abundant. First, it cited the purchase by Saudi Arabia of Chinese CSS-2 missiles, each with a 2,000- mile range. This was proof enough, it claimed, that missile technology was proliferating. Next the group cited Iraqi tests of ICBM configurations, and the United Nations' belief that prior to the Gulf War Iraq was 18-months away from having atomic weapons.      Most troubling, and contentious, was the issue of the viability of the North Korean Taepo Dong 2 ICBM, the most advanced system being developed by a Third World nation.     Heritage quoted then-Deputy Defense Secretary John  Deutch as telling Congress in August 1994 that the TD2 "may be able to strike U.S. territory by the end of the decade." Such a capability, it was noted, would come less than five years after its discovery by U.S. intelligence.**Scud or no Scud?      The Union's scientists were also mindful that actual deployment of the TD2 was speculative at best, and even under the most optimistic timetable would not actually threaten U.S. soil for years. The CIA confirmed such estimates last summer.      The Defense Intelligence Agency reported last fall that the TD2 would have a range only of 4650 miles, using a nuclear warhead sized for its lifting power. But the DIA also said a smaller yield warhead mounted on the missile would extend its range to more than 6,000 miles. It was just this modified configuration that Arizona Republican Sen. John Kyl quoted South Korean intelligence as detecting.      The intel sources, Kyl said, have discovered North Korea was furiously making technical improvements to both missile and warhead designs in configurations that could reach all major U.S. cities on the west coast plus those of Europe.      Others in the U.S. intelligence community dismissed both the TD2 and any accelerated program. The missile was still "basically a glorified Scud," one analyst said, and without a guidance system or upper stage can't threaten any specific site.      The CIA and the DoD considered the accuracy of the TD2 so poor many within the agencies wondered what the fuss was about.      But other pointed out that if proliferation was as prevalent as feared, missile programs like the TD2 would not stay static. "Even the V-2 became a launch vehicle", one industry source told Military Space.     Part II Which Defense?

That successful space exchange ranks as an important a space milestone as the first use of an orbiting ECHO satellite to transmit greetings to Earth by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the afternoon of Aug. 13, 1960.**Satellite-to-satellite crosslinks      The military space "handshake" took place when the written message, signed by Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, was uplinked to Milstar 1 from the National Military Command Center, Fort Belvoir, Va., at 10:52 p.m. EST Dec. 15.      Milstar 1's crosslink dish antenna was used to process and relay the message signal to Milstar 2 orbiting in the same plane. Milstar 2 then downlinked the message to the U.S. Pacific Command, Camp Smith, Hawaii, and to the U.S. Atlantic Command, Norfolk, Va.      Each Milstar spacecraft incorporates two crosslink dish antennas located at opposite ends of the rectangular satellite bus. These will eventually be used to connect the four operational Milstar satellites to form a self-contained, secure space constellation that can be controlled from a single fixed- or mobile-site.**Unique Milstar technologies      The Milstar system remains unique to military space communications technology. The signals processing system operates in the extremely high-frequency (EHF) and super high -frequency (SHF) bands. Technologies in on-board signal processing, on-board signal routing, on-board resource control, crossbanding and crosslinking are space-born capabilities unique in the Milstar series.      The satellites are designed to display immunity to jamming and signal interception, possible in part by the satellite's ability to move transmissions from frequency to frequency across the full 2 GHz bandwidth.**Block II satellites planned      The first in the series was launched Feb. 7, 1994 with the second orbited Nov. 6, 1995, both aboard Titan IV boosters. Air Force launch plans call for full operational use of the Block I units now in space, with the second satellite completing testing and becoming fully operational later this year.      But in 1999 a Titan IVB is scheduled to launch four additional Block II satellites that will feature both the low data rate system now on the first generation as well as a medium data rate, tactical communications payload package. The four Block II vehicles will eventually replace the pair of Block Is now in service.      Each Milstar spacecraft, the largest military satellites ever launched, has an on-orbit life of 10 years.  Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY SPACE via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996AIA's Fuqua: Aerospace recovery under way     Despite falling sales in 1995, the Aerospace Industries Assn. sees the industry riding toward growth in 1996.      If this forecast is correct, it would mark the first year of positive numbers for the aerospace industry since 1991. "The light we see at the end of the tunnel is not an oncoming train," AIA president Don Fuqua said last month at the group's annual year-end review in Washington. "It is the light of a new dawn for the aerospace industry, the herald of an era of stability and exceptional promise," he said. **1996 sales to rise-but DoD dollars will drop      AIA anticipates industry sales will rise 3.2% to a total $111 billion this year. The jump will come from a surge in airline sales, projected to be about $7 billion.      Sales to the DoD will continue to decline, however, with a $3 billion drop in 1966. Also sales to other federal agencies will drop by $213 million.      The turnaround overall will be led by a rise in civil aircraft, engines and parts, with a 24% growth expected in 1996 to $5.6 billion.      Civil helicopter sales will also grow, AIA said, some 18% to $268 million. But the biggest increase expected in this year will be in space-sector sales, with a whopping $1 billion rise, to annual sales projected of $28 billion.      American space launchers and satellites are driving that growth, Fuqua said. **Declines continue in military weaponry      As in years past, cuts in defense acquisitions will cause weapons procurements to drop. Missiles sales will fall 23% to $5.7 billion, military aircraft will drop $1.4 billion to annual sales of $30 billion, and overall aerospace/defense employment will decline 2%, from its 1995 totals, to 763,000 workers.      Production workers will number 243,000, a loss of 6,000 job. Scientist and engineer slots fell in 1995 by 6%; technician slots declined by 7%.      Overall industry net profit after taxes fell 20% to $4.5 billion following a 1994 record high. Despite these reductions, Fuqua said aerospace profits are expected to surpass the margins generated by all manufacturing industries combined.     Since 1989, total aerospace industry employment has dropped a staggering 42%. The pattern of these declines was cited by outgoing Lockheed Martin CEO Daniel Tellup. He told a Washington press briefing, prior to the release of the AIA numbers, he expected the decline of the aerospace/defense industry to slow in 1996, but a full upswing was still waiting in the wings.      Tellup, as did Fuqua, said the best areas for profits in defenses were in servicing existing systems and weapons programs, with tailor-made upgrade programs and small, system-by-system enhancements. Production of replacement systems won't involve major operations.      For 1996, the Clinton administration had plans to buy no new tanks, only four new warships and only 127 military aircraft, including helicopters and transport planes.     Military space dollars were concentrated in the final phases of large programs like DSCS and Titan IV and the beginnings of SBIR, EELV and SMTS.      Jointness as a policy element, and widening awareness of the need for using space assets fully in the battlefield environment, also were strong drivers for space in the defense sector -- although not in the size of dollar numbers as say military aircraft or missiles.      But total R&D proposed as a part of the DoD new budget authority in fiscal year 1996 shrank to 14%, dropping more to 11% by 1999.      The Congressional Budget Office reports the administration remains about $101 billion short of the amounts needed for a fully modernized Bottom-Up Review force, a fact not addressed by either Clinton or the Republican Congress.      From FYs 1996 through 2002, defense budgets projected by both side decline an average of 20% from FY 1995 spending.  Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY SPACE via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996The Editor's Notebook: Issues and answers in defense & space ...Remembering a warrior's legacy      When all has been written about the defense policies of the late 20th century, what will be the issues that will linger to stir America?     One that will likely remain is the question of a Revolution in Military Affairs, and the exact form that such an RMA might take. A second is likely to be the endless debate over ballistic missile threats, defenses, and the costs and timetables for each, real or imagined, needed or not.      A third issue likely to remain to haunt some future defense secretary is the cost of space launch, and the many ways to make space transportation affordable and accessible to military spacecraft and public researchers.      If it is true that the resolution of these latter issues will shape the security and viability of America's industrial base and its future as a great power, then history will surely remember the life and legacy of Daniel O. Graham, who died New Year's Eve at 70.**He saw the 'High Frontier'      Graham will most likely be remembered as the founder of High Frontier, the association of scientists, scholars and strategists determined to craft a comprehensive ballistic missile defense against the Soviet Union at the Cold War's climax.      In his role as High Frontier's director, Graham became a familiar figure in Washington meetings, hearings and press conferences, urging American policymakers to marshall the technological will to banish forever the dread of nuclear attack. **The legacy of 'Team B'      But much less known to the public - and more important to history - was the reason behind much of Graham's determined support for what became later the Strategic Defense Initiative.      Some 20 years ago a great debate raged within the defense establishment over the strength and purposes of Soviet military intentions. To forge what was considered by some to be a more realistic picture of the Russian bear's embrace, the CIA chartered a team of government and industry experts and thinkers to see what the USSR might do with military superiority.      Graham, who was then the director, the Defense Intelligence Agency, was a member of that "Team B" group. He gathered what he would call later "exhaustive" documentation of the depths of the unmatched threat from Soviet weapons programs flourishing under "detente." He knew then what the risks were to an unprotected America, exposed in the late 1970s and early 1980s to the threat of Soviet missiles.     Graham's later concept of a "defense that defends" was an effort to repel that threat.      A quarter century after the Team B report, the fall of the Soviet state, the rise of Russian Communism and missile proliferation, there is still no consensus on how to defend the nation against missile attack. And Graham's idea of a space-born shield of protection remains, for the time, only on paper.     So, too, does languish the idea of truly affordable space transportation, with more studies than spaceships the product of America's labs. Here, too, Graham played a key role in defining the issue. In 1990 he founded the Space Transportation Association to push the military and NASA to look anew at a bold concept for a single stage launcher, a true spaceship.      He haunted the halls of the Pentagon and Congress, calling for a rational review of America's launch capabilities. His work finally paid off in the unique Delta Clipper, single-stage prototype vehicle, started first by the Strategic Defense Initiative Program, and later by NASA, that awarded Graham its Distinguished Service Award last year for his work on space launch.      But the Clipper remains only a test program, and the follow-on X rockets mired in budget woes and acrimony. Like the issue of strategic defense, promising beginnings, made possible in part by Graham's advocacy, have not been followed by a matching vision of policymakers -- at least not yet.     But when the moment finally comes, early in the 21st century, when a single-stage spaceship returns to a free port from orbit, it will have been powered, in part, by the ideas of that retired Army General who would not take "no" for an answer.      And there will also come a time when missiles no longer threaten American skies. When ballistic missiles will have but one purpose: to launch small satellites, not warheads. When that age comes to America, her children will owe the peace that comes with stability to Graham's vision of SDI, an idea for which time might finally have come.      A stampede to orbit, and quiet in the heavens: fitting legacies to Daniel Graham, who gave testament to relentless truth. It took, not an admiral of the seas or an aviator of the skies but an Army General to, not unquietly, find security by sailing against the wind.      He will be remembered ... and missed.Back to Headline List CopyrightMILITARY SPACE via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996Research and Reading     Subscribers interested in learning more about the role of Gen.

In retaliation for an additional $7 billion in unrequested spending contained both in the earlier-signed FY 1996 Defense Appropriations Bill and the vetoed FY 1996 Defense Authorization Bill, Defense Secretary Perry has ordered cuts of nearly $2 billion to approved programs as partial offsets.      Some rescission cuts have already been imposed on such projects as military satellites (SBIR, SMTS and Milstar), launchers (Titan IV), and weapons (ASAT studies and other BMD work).      Although not significant reductions, the rescissions will, nonetheless, play havoc with program schedules planned for the New Year.***     Remembering a legend ... In the aftermath of the passing of Adm. Arleigh Burke, many in Washington remember the "sailor's sailor" as a major, driving force behind the Navy's Polaris missile program -- but in a measured way typical of the crafty old salt.      Burke supported Polaris, but remained determined that the Navy never become totally dependent on sub-launched missiles. His Naval Warfare Analysis Group also moved to use Polaris to put the Navy at the heart of strategic issues, a firefight at the time with the Air Force.      He was adroit at using his political power carefully, cementing a "place in the strategic sun," as one author described him, for the newly nuclear Navy.

Also recommended wasestablishing adequate chemical and biological survivability, improving thereliability test program, using more efficient spares and replenishmentconcepts and using contractor Raytheon Co.  resources more smartly.The Army concurred with almost all the audit findings.  But the service didnot agree to add additional development test reporting dates saying reportingrequirements were adequate.  And the Army requested the Pentagon direct testand evaluation master plan revision recommendations to the Army MaterielSystems Analysis Activity.A June 28 letter from Michael Hartwell, deputy director of the MissileCommand's Integrated Materiel Management Center Air Defense Directorate,included in the report takes issue with the finding that the inventory planwastes money.  At issue are so-called "just-in-time" and "direct vendordelivery" strategies.  The former refers to delivering parts as needed and notstoring them, and the latter to sending parts right to the user and not to awarehouse."Once a system has been deployed and the sustainment concepts initiated forseveral years [like Patriot]...it requires a major overhaul of all facets ofthe support structure" to use the two strategies, said the letter.In addition, Patriot parts are such that they require intense managementattention, making it unfeasible to store them at the contractor, said thenote.  "In fact, the prime contractor [Raytheon] is currently requesting theremoval of all GFM [government-furnished material] that is...stored at thefacility."George Schneiter, undersecretary of defense for strategic and tacticalsystems, disagreed with the audit recommendation that PAC-3 s so-called "exitcriteria" needed to move into production require that components meetreliability levels established in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD).He said that action was not necessary."What must be demonstrated for such decision points is that the program is ontrack or at the proper point on its reliability growth curve to achieve ORDstandards" by the time of deployment, he wrote.The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization agreed with all the conclusions andrecommendations.The audit s purpose was to determine if PAC-3 management is cost-effective andsufficient to lead to a low-rate initial production decision in early fiscal1998 at an estimated cost of $252.4 million.The report listed a number of management actions or plans to respond to therecommendations.  For the low-rate initial production strategy risk, thePentagon issued a Program Budget Decision (No.  224) last February whichdeferred deployment until the first quarter of fiscal 1999.In addition, the Army instituted a risk-reduction program ("final scope andlevel of effort will depend on contractor response to non-to-exceed package")and inserted extra time between flight test for analyses and potential fixes.For the chemical and biological survivability issue, the Patriot office tookseveral steps.  First, it established and applied exit criteria involvingchemical and biological survivability in the critical design review process;and second, established a five-step general approach to address chemical andbiological survivability issues.  The steps included:o defining quantitative and measurable chemical and biological survivabilityhardness requirements in the Operational Requirements Document in compliancewith Army policy;o completing a system survivability assessment and report to determine thecurrent status of the Patriot s vulnerability;o performing trade-off analysis and studies to determine what survivabilityenhancements that can becan be cost-effectively achieved;o briefing the Nuclear and Chemical Survivability Committee Secretariat onsystem assessment and trade-off analysis results; and,o incorporating chemical and biological survivability into the Patriot systemin the most cost-effective manner.On the issue of better use of contractor resources, on Oct.  26, 1995, thePatriot office established a Memorandum of Agreement with Loral Corp.  (nowpart of Lockheed Martin Corp.)  to provide program manager real-timeassessment through participation in Integrated Product Teams, participate inplanning, executing and following risk reduction plans to determine missileproduction readiness; and, strengthen engineering, surveillance and contractcompliance activities.Back to Headline List CopyrightMISSILE DEFENSE REPORT via NewsNetNovember 22, 1996SBIRS CONTRACT AWARDED TO LOCKHEED MARTINThe Air Force has awarded a $1.8 billion contract to a Lockheed MartinCorp.-led team to build the potential $17 billion Space Based Infrared Systemearly warning satellite follow-on to the Defense Support Program.The team, including Northrop Grumman Corp., Honeywell and Aerojet beat aHughes Aircraft Co.-TRW Inc.  team.The contract is for the SBIRS so-called "high element."

The weapon to be applied to themission is the $100 million Tactical High Energy Laser being developed at theArmy Space and Strategic Defense Command (SSDC).EELS is specifically interested in survivability and situational awareness toprotect forces at the point when troops first enter a battlefield area.  Thatmeans the system must be tactically deployable (a trailer towed by a Humvee),be highly reliable, need little sustainment and be able to operate in anaustere environment with no depot or logistics readily available.To this end EELS is performing a small-scale study to create a data base thatnext year can be plugged into EELS battlefield simulation system.  Last JulyTRW Inc.  won an $89 million contract to develop and field the system inconjunction with Israeli firms Rafael, Israel Aircraft Industries and Tadiran.U.S.  subcontractors include McDonnell Douglas Corp.  and W.J.  SchaeferAssociates.  The system is to be completed next November.According to the Army SSDC, THEL will be able to rapidly fire for close-inengagements and cost "only a few thousand dollars per kill or less with a deepmagazine to counter saturation attacks."The price tag is an important consideration, given that THEL is a chemicallaser powered by deuterium fluoride.  Deuterium is extremely expensive,costing about $1 per gas liter.  The Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser(MIRACL) upon which THEL is based used 6,000 liters a second for two to threesecond bursts, said a knowledgeable industry source.  Safety is also an issuebecause fluoride is a deadly gas.A high energy laser against short-range rockets was tested and demonstrated inthe "Nautilus" program, an outgrowth of Project Strong Safety, incollaboration with Israel.  The program was conducted primarily at SSDC s HighEnergy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range, N.M., andutilized a fraction of the MIRACL s megawatt power to emulate the THEL weaponconcept performance, according to SSDC.  The program successfully destroyed ashort range rocket in flight on Feb.  9, 1996.The Army Air Defense Artillery School in Fort Bliss, Texas, has beendesignated as the THEL proponent by the Training and Doctrine Command andplans to develop a mission need statement and operational concept that couldlead to an operational requirement.Back to Headline List CopyrightMISSILE DEFENSE REPORT via NewsNetNovember 22, 1996MISSILE DIGEST tmo Air Force Wright Laboratory is interested in receiving proposals forcountermeasures for missile infrared seekers.  The purpose of this ImagingSeeker Countermeasure program is to address both surface-to-air and air-to-airimaging seeker threats and define and develop innovative countermeasure (CM)solutions, methods and techniques to defeat them.  Existing CM techniques havebeen optimized against reticle scan missile seekers.  New systems will need toaddress current and advanced (imaging) missile threats.  A Program Researchand Development Announcement (PRDA) is being used for this solicitation toencourage new and innovative concepts for both near-term and far-termapplications.This program consists of three technical efforts to accomplish this goal.They include Imaging Threat Investigations (ITIV), Imaging SensorCountermeasure Follow-On (ISCF) and the Imaging Countermeasures ConceptDevelopment (ICCD) program.  Alternative approaches will also be considered.The objective of the ITIV effort is to determine possible imaging threatseeker configurations and key technologies.Of particular interest are surface-to-air and air-to-air configurations whichshall be directed against aircraft.  This effort shall investigate components,subsystems and technologies used in imaging seeker development.  This programshall begin with a survey of key technologies and existing data describingsystem functions of potential imaging threats.  This shall include optics,sensors, processors and architectures, as well as, image processing techniquesand tracking algorithms.  During this investigation, the offeror shall combineR&D with available intelligence information to predict one or more imagingseeker configurations.  This effort shall postulate hardware configurations,and define and create software flowcharts and/or block diagrams for eachimaging seeker threat defined.  Components shall be identified along withequations, transfer functions, or any other necessary information to model thethreat system and subsystems.The objective of the ISCF effort is to evaluate the performance of signaturemanagement based countermeasures (CM) against imaging seekers through fieldtesting.  This program shall continue the development of candidatetechnologies and techniques for imaging sensor countermeasures.  The needexists to explore concepts which are robust against an expected difficultthreat.  This effort shall take advantage of, and then advance the results ofcontract No.  F33615-93-C-1224 (Imaging Sensors CM (ISCM) Program) whichperformed countermeasure and signature analysis against imaging sensors.Information on the ISCM is available from a classified annex.  The ISCM FinalReport shall be made available to the contractor after contract award.  Thisnew ISCF effort shall concentrate on testing the CM concepts in the field.  Adetermination shall be made if signature management based CM concepts are aviable means to defeat imaging sensors.The approach for this effort is to first review the Final Report and auxiliarydata from the ISCM program, then evaluate the progress that was made.  Next,explore new and past paint and coatings technology and its application tocountermeasure concepts.  This technology may be either new or resulting fromthe ISCM contract.  This effort shall also update the CM concept priority listdeveloped on the ISCM program.  Field testing is expected to make use of radiocontrolled models and appropriate sensor devices to evaluate performance.  Itis important that lessons learned from the first program combine with thecontractors expertise to define and execute a field test that adequatelyevaluates CM concept performance.  The contractor shall develop a methodology(test plan) that tests the concepts to clearly determine if the CM techniquesmerit transition to full scale.Some critical areas to be considered are the problems associated with fieldtesting and the unique problems of scaled testing.  Unique, imaginative use ofavailable scale model technology and resources are encouraged.  Conceptstested shall not enhance current seeker performance, but may allow improvedconventional CM performance against imaging seekers.  This effort shallimplement these Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) concepts (from both theprevious ISCM and this contract) by obtaining the material, coatings, etc.,that exhibit the desired effects, and test for effectiveness.Effects may have to be simulated where technology is unavailable or tooexpensive for this effort.  If possible, this effort shall take advantage ofother programs or contractors own IR&D to supply technology.  If informationis available in a timely manner, this effort may take advantage of findingsfrom the ITIV effort to help predict potential vulnerabilities of imagingseekers and use the predicted threat configurations for the advanced sensorsrequired during field testing.  An Associate Contractor Agreement may berequired to coordinate the ITIV with this effort.  The first effort (ISCM)used one scale model, tested at one geographical location, using limitedflight profiles, and did not attempt cooperative concepts.  The goal of thiseffort is to demonstrate the performance of the best concepts under a widerrange of environmental conditions, more small-scale aircraft, additionalscenarios and combinations with traditional CM s, if possible.Testing should include flightworthy (full scale) materials when possible andshall use advanced sensor platforms which allow determination of effectivenessand robustness.  The test results will be analyzed in order to determine ifintegration of the ideas and concepts into an aircraft countermeasure systemis possible.The objective of the ICCD effort is to develop innovative CM solutions,implementation techniques, and methods to defeat the anti-aircraft imagingseeker threats.  This program shall research and evaluate past and existingimaging seeker CM work to focus on solutions to defeat the threat.  As itbecomes available, this effort shall utilize any findings from the parallelITIV effort described above.  From this review and the contractors ownexpertise, the contractor shall theorize a potential set of CM solutions andoutline methods to implement them.  Potential countermeasures should considerthe overall systems approach as well as address operational issues.The results shall be tested using a missile simulation (and environment) torank and evaluate the countermeasure effectiveness.  The environment used fortesting shall include missile models that includes all necessary components,preferably industry recognized.  Selection and use of a model shall bediscussed at the design review prior to testing.  It shall be a goal of thiseffort to breadboard at least one concept and demonstrate performance.The total length of the technical effort is estimated to be 24 months for theITIV and 30 months each for the ISCF and ICCD.  An additional 5 months shallbe added to the technical period of performance to provide for processing andcompletion of the final report.The expected award date is May 1, 1997.  The Government funding is expected tobe $1,475,000, allocated as follows:  a total of $350,000 for ITIV including$35,000 (fiscal 1997) $200,000 in 1998 and $115,000 in 1999; a total of$525,000 for ISCF including $100,000 in fiscal 1997, $250,000 in 1998 and$175,000 in 1999; and a total of $600K for ICCD including $20,000 in fiscal1997, $300,000 in 1998 and $280,000 in 1999.A classified annex for the Imaging Sensor Countermeasure Follow-On isavailable upon request to qualified offerors.

Rear Adm. Daniel J. Murphy Jr., commander, Eisenhower Battle Group, and commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8, said the experiment was but a gleam in the eye of Vice Chairman, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. William Owens three years ago.     The Mountain Top experiment will demonstrate the "forward pass" concept, which will use elevated sensors and illuminators, set up on a Hawaiian cliff, to pass information via the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC).      Hopefully, this will allow an Aegis cruiser to launch a Standard Missile toward a low-flying threat the ship's sensors can't see, because it is over the ship's horizon. The threat will be illuminated from the cliff, and the cliff-based sensor will provide a guidance update for the ship's missile, to score an intercept.       CEC is the Navy's program that combines all the combat systems and major sensors on ships into a single networked battle force system. It is an automatic, jam-resistant network, which takes radar measurement information from all ships, blending it into a composite picture. The same information -- a common air picture -- is available on each CEC-equipped ship.     Murphy said Patriot and Hawk systems, two CEC cruisers, a cruiser without CEC, an E2-C aircraft and an Air Force Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft will participate in the experiment.      The test will also look at discriminating through the clutter and backscatter radars experience near shore, and how to deal with more simultaneous threats.      Initial operational capability for CEC is anticipated in July. After a rigorous 18 months of demonstrations and at-sea tests, which include what Murphy called, "getting a glimpse of what it [CEC] will offer when it is integrated with other systems ...."     Murphy said "the vision is that the [NATO common communications] Link 16 will become the universal command and control network, where force orders will be sent [and] data exchanged. But like any other system, it's only as good as the information being put into it."     CEC, as the principal underpinning of Link 16, would standardize all of the information that rides on it as the common data link of the future.     The Air Force is anxious to participate in CEC, and is looking at the AWACS platform in particular. The Army is still studying what CEC could add to its capabilities.     Murphy said while there's still skepticism about CEC, he's "absolutely convinced that 10 years from now, there will be no naysayers."      CEC buys time, Murphy said, with the opportunity to make the right decision. It also expands the protected battlespace, and protection is essential to project power, he added. "Broadly, CEC will ultimately help revolutionize the way all joint forces are structured."     By mid-January, Murphy will be in his new job, N86, director, Surface Warfare Div., at the Pentagon.     While nothing is set in stone as yet, Murphy told Navy News he has some ideas about what he wants to accomplish in the new job:     * Emphasize improvements to the warfighting architecture to maximize the capabilities of existing weapons systems through improved combat identification capability.     * Through technology, including electronic controls, move the surface Navy closer to what is done in the commercial world -- to trust computers to do what people do today.      For instance, he said, today ships can have as many as 15 people on the bridge when entering port. "We have not integrated sensors with alarms and controls. My vision is to get to a pilot, copilot concept in a ship, like a plane. We've not yet made the jump commercial aviation made 40 years ago."Back to Headline List CopyrightNAVY NEWS & UNDERSEA TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996Carderock's minisub race won by Tennessee team     To take advantage of the holiday season, an illustrious group of college students met at the Carderock Naval  Surface Warfare Center, Bethesda, Md., Dec. 27-30, jumped in the David Taylor model basin and raced against the clock -- in muscle-powered mini submarines.      Thirteen teams participated in the race, sponsored by the Foundation for Underwater Research and Education, the fourth of the biannual events held since 1989. This year's meeting was the first under the controlled conditions of a basin.      The first three races were held in the ocean off the coast of Florida. But for the designers, eliminating unpredictable side effects such as ocean currents and weather makes it easier to concentrate on the main job: creating a fast man-powered minisub.     There was a mind-boggling amount of high-tech designed into submarines built by small community colleges and even high schools students. Most contestants used advanced composite materials, and one entry even had an onboard computer to adjust the propeller blades to speed and water drag. This boat, the OMER from the Ecole de Technologie Superieure, Montreal, Canada, won the innovation category, but it could not challenge Tennessee Technological University's Torpedo III, which reached 5.36 knots.      Water-lubricated bearings, highly efficient transmissions (most often in the style of bicycle pedals) and sophisticated shapes to reduce drag are standard. So are highly trained athletes who "bike" the boats to stunning speeds along the 3,200 foot-long basin.      One boat, the Mermaid of the Annapolis Human-Powered Submarine Club, composed of engineers at the Annapolis facility of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, even had to face enemy fire.      A metal structure as tall as the boat itself fell on the Mermaid before the crew could put it into the water for even a single run. The tail fin shattered, but it was replaced to log a good run time. Maybe for this proof of survivability and maintainability, the jury awarded the Mermaid the first prize for the best use of composites. **The Navy seeks talent     Carderock's spokesman Tom Warring said the numerous inventions had been made coincidentally, and the Navy had engineers at the race to look at the 13 entries from the United States, Canada and Mexico.      But, as Joel Spencer, the head of the Cape Fear Community College, Wilmington, N.C., said, these raceboats involve different aspects of submarine design than the Navy may want to explore. Noise, for example, the quintessential measure of a warship, is no factor at all for the race boats. Cape Fear won the overall design category.     But Warring said the Navy was currently doing work on manpowered Seal delivery vehicles, and there is a chance something new could emerge from the studies of the 13 teams.     John Hussey, one of the volunteers who organized the event, said the real advantage for the Navy is to get a pool of talented young people, who are thinking of making naval engineering a career, and show them there is interest in their ideas.      "The goal is to form a relationship between bright young minds and those who want to tap into those minds in the future," Hussey said.      Hussey said he knew of the head of the first winning team, in 1989, who went on to a remarkable career in the Navy.      And then there is the public relations coup the Navy got as a mentor during the slow news days of the Christmas season.      The four major Washington local television stations had reports on the event, and the Associated Press and the New York Times help spread the word.     For information on the sub race series, call Nancy Hussey at 410-326-6896.Back to Headline List CopyrightNAVY NEWS & UNDERSEA TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996DoD reduces impact of 'rule of two' decision     The DoD has proposed expanding contracting opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) after it suspended the SDB set-aside program.      In October the DoD suspended its "rule of two" set-aside program for SDBs, as part of the government's on-going review of all federal race-based programs. DoD acted in response to the Supreme Court's June decision in Adarand v. Pena (NN, 10/30/95).     Proposed new DoD contracting procedures include:      * expanding the mandatory use of the 10% price preference for SDBs to include competitive awards based on other than price or price related factors;      * considering small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business subcontracting as a factor in the evaluation of past performance;     * requiring prime contractors to notify the contracting officer of any substitutions of firms that are not small, small disadvantaged or women-owned small businesses for the firms listed in the subcontracting plan; and      * establishing a test program of an SDB evaluation preference that would remove bond cost differentials between SDBs and other businesses as a factor in most source selections for construction acquisitions.     The DoD said the new proposals will significantly enhance the opportunities for SDBs to participate as key elements of the defense industrial base.     The Justice Dept. continues to coordinate efforts to review programs to ensure they are in compliancewith Adarand and the president's July policy directive.       Also Justice is continuing efforts to reform federal government procurement to meet these standards while ensuring that "individuals traditionally excluded from businessopportunities have a chance to compete meaningfully for government contracts," the DoD said.

Paul Kaminski, DoD's undersecretary for Acquisition and Technology, directed an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) acquisition approach for the vehicle.       Kaminski made his decision last month after digesting final staff recommendations for satisfying the tactical need for reconnaissance, surveillance and targeting at sea or on land.      He agreed with the recommendation to procure six TUAV systems, each consisting of four air vehicles and sensors, plus eight attrition vehicles.      The TUAV performance and cost requirements were outlined by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC), Dec. 15, in JROC Memorandum 150-95.      The DoD has designated the Joint Program Office for UAVs, within the Program Executive Office for Cruise Missiles and UAVs, as the lead for the TUAV acquisition.     Contracting support will be provided by Naval Air Systems Command.**Hauls mixed payload     The air vehicle will have the capacity to carry a variety of payloads, including electro-optical and infrared imagery sensors, and, if practical, a synthetic aperture radar.      The vehicle will have a minimum of three hours on station at up to 200 kilometers for field and shipboard use.  The TUAV requirements also include electromagnetic interference shielding and anti-corrosion features.       If offerors do not provide automatic takeoff and landing and a heavy fuel engine, or HFE, as part of the basic system, options for development and integration of those capabilities into the TUAV will be requested by the government, the DoD said.      Development of a common ground reception, processing, and control system, providing for or leading to compatibility with other UAVs, collection systems, and command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems, is also a program requirement.       Another UAV system, the Hunter has been blasted by some admirals and the General Accounting Office. They agree the Hunter does not satisfy shipboard and naval operational requirements (NN, 12/11/95). Back to Headline List CopyrightNAVY NEWS & UNDERSEA TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996GAO: Navy clipped AF's wings through faulty stats     The Navy used statistics at its own pleasure and advantage when it cut the Air Force out of an F-18 maintenance deal, the General Accounting Office says.     In an effort to minimize maintenance costs for its F-18 fleet, the Navy subjected the depot work to a competition. Four contenders emerged; two private firms, the Ogden (Utah) Air Logistics Center and the Naval Aviation Depot, North Island, San Diego.      In a first competition, Ogden won on cost and began to perform the Modification, Corrosion and Paint Program (MCAPP) in 1993, the year of the competition. But the Navy immediately informed the Air Force the sea service intended to maintain a core capability in-house, and Ogden would only get the minimum number of aircraft specified in the competition documents.      Core capability requirements are a common argument in the privatization debate between the Defense Dept. and private contractors. The issues involve the availability of private workers in war areas and their reliability due to labor conflicts that cannot rock the military. Such arguments seemed not to play a role in interservice competition.     Core capability generally goes beyond service requirements. "However," GAO admits, "in practice it appears each service will be allowed to define a core capability requirement for its own essential systems and equipment ... ."     In September 1994, a year after the initial competition, the Navy determined in a bid for additional work that North Station could perform the MCAPP faster and cheaper than Ogden. Thus the Navy decided not to exercise an option for an additional year of work at Ogden, and consolidated the work in California.     Consolidation, the GAO says, is more cost-effective than splitting the work between two contractors. But , if the Navy knew it wanted an in-house capability and could therefore not consolidate at any other place, why launch  a competition in the first place?     According to the Navy, quality of work was comparable at Navy and Air Force depots. The reason for the award to North Station was the faster turn-around time. If an aircraft takes less time in the maintenance pipeline, fewer planes are needed to meet the readiness requirements.     But the Air Force contends that the delays experienced in the period used by the Navy to make its decision were caused by the Navy itself. Late funding delayed start-up and replacement parts (which under the contract the Navy was to provide) arrived behind schedule. Additionally approval of work wasn't on time.**The ghost of the A-12 lawsuit     Such Navy activity is reminiscent of why a federal judge ruled last year that the Navy had to reimburse contractors for the terminated A-12 bomber development contract (NN, 12/25/95).     The Navy, the GAO furthermore concludes, compared apples and oranges when it used data for ground-based F-18 and compared them to carrier-based ones, and looked at different stages on the learning curve in comparing cost at North Station and Ogden. Accounting for these methodological flaws, Ogden would have come out the slightly cheaper place for the MCAPP, the GAO says.**DoD guidance required     The GAO conclusion can be read as an absolution of the Navy as well as an indictment. "We recommend that the secretary of Defense develop and implement guidance on using merit-based selection procedures when moving depot workload," the GAO says, thus putting the onus of change on the secretary.     On the other hand, in an era where "fewer regulation" has become the dominant buzzword, requesting more DoD regulations also implies that the Navy is not capable of finding reasonable and cost-saving ways to handle its maintenance work, the GAO adds.     The F-18 maintenance work continues today at North Station.

The Corps ordered 17 of the vehicles designed to defend against air attacks, but also capable of fighting ground threats. The cost is $70 million, including the operational support tab.      The LAV-AD (for air defense) features eight Stinger missiles distributed over two launch sets and a 25 mm gun.**System has added fire power      Including the eight extra missiles stored onboard and the large amount of ammunition for the gun (385 rounds in the gun magazine plus 605 extra), the vehicle has enough firepower for 44 engagements, its manufacturer Lockheed Martin says.      The Navy's "Forward ... From the Sea" strategy calls for rapid deployment and sustainment of ground forces from the sea. The LAV family meets these requirements, the Marines contend.      The craft features self-protection technology against  nuclear, biological and chemical attack and laser-protected windows. Its data links allow instant communication with other units or other services through satellite hook-ups.      For rapid deployment, the 29,000-pound vehicle can be airlifted by C-130 transports or CH-53 helicopters. Tests, which began in 1991, show its good surface mobility and the ability to fire on the move.      Since the beginning of the test and evaluation phase, 54,000 rounds of ammunition and 26 live Stingers have been fired, and tests in extreme heat and cold conducted, Ron Gagne, a Lockheed Martin executive in the Burlington, Vt., facility told Navy News.      The order of 17 represents four groups of four, plus an extra vehicle. Gagne said the initial requirement was higher, but the changes in force structure impacted the Marine Corps LAV fleet.Back to Headline List CopyrightNAVY NEWS & UNDERSEA TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996Northrop Grumman grows via Westinghouse     Defense giant Northrop Grumman bought Westinghouse's Defense Electronics Div. offered for sale last year.     Northrop Grumman, itself created through a merger in May 1994, managed to obtain sufficient credit from different banks to close the $3 billion deal, the Los Angeles-based company announced Jan. 3.     Northrop Grumman is involved in fighter and surveillance aircraft, electronics and systems integration, precision weapon systems and information technology.     Westinghouse has a strong naval business, making radars, surveillance technology, anti-submarine gear, torpedoes and anti-torpedo systems and other electronics for underwater applications.      One major naval program will stay with Westinghouse for the time being: the submarine auxiliary propulsion, developed and produced in the Pittsburgh Science and Technology Center. A part of the center is moving to NG, but the sub engines are not, an official said.      The new company's sales could top $10 billion by the end of the decade, said NG's CEO Kent Kresa. Northrop Grumman's sales in 1995 reached $6.8 billion; Westinghouse's $2.6 billion.     Northrop Grumman was not a top pick when analysts and defense experts put their heads together after the announcement that Westinghouse would go on the block.      Despite synergies in the electronics between Westinghouse's and NG's business, the acquisition broadens NG's business. Particularly in the underwater area, Westinghouse will add considerably to NG's current product line. That is a deviation from the industry trend to consolidate around a narrowly defined core business and drop other areas.     Some expect that Northrop Grumman will soon look for buyers of these areas outside its own core business.      By contrast, NG raised bank commitments of $4.8 billion, in excess of the purchase price and the financial commitments the buyer assumed for employee benefits. These are estimated at $600 million.      In addition, Kresa noted NG had succeeded in reducing its overall debt by $200 million more than expected in 1995, to $1.6 billion.     All the financial data indicate NG may as well try to break out of the trend and enlarge its defense business base.Back to Headline List CopyrightNAVY NEWS & UNDERSEA TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996Admiral Burke rests at Annapolis     World War II hero Adm.
