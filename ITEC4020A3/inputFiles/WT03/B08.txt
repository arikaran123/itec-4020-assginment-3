The 4-4 tie in the Lotus v.  Borland casewill likely encourage parties to look to other forums,particularly legislative bodies, for guidance and relief.Most lawyers interviewed for this story say that there aren'tmany cases percolating down below that are likely bait forSupreme Court justices to nibble on.  "The age of the big casesis over," said Jonathan Band, a partner in Morrison & Foerster'sD.C. office and coauthor of Interfaces on Trial, a book thatrelives the great court fights involving software in the 1980sand 1990s, Computer Associates v.  Altai, Apple v.  Microsoft,Sega v.  Accolade, among many others.  "I don't see a case thatwill capture the imagination of the Supreme Court and theindustry."The Supreme Court's tie vote affirmed the First Circuit'sdecision that Borland's copying the menu tree from Lotus's 1-2-3spreadsheet program was not a copyright violation.  But theunwritten decision has no precedential value and will give scantguidance on what aspects of software are copyrightableexpression and what are uncopyrightable methods of operation.                          HOPES DASHEDMost observers were surprised the court took the case in thefirst place.  Once it did, there was widespread hope that thejustices would finally clear the air between the protectionists,represented by Lotus and its new parent, IBM, and theinteroperable folks who brought the world Borland's Quattro Proand other products that have had depended upon their ability towork with their competitors' products.With the court so divided, it may be a long time before thejustices step into software waters anytime soon.  Justice JohnPaul Stevens did not participate.Even before the Supreme Court's ruling, there was already plentyof action out of court to take care of what that might otherwisetake place inside the courtroom.There is a multiyear effort, for example, to revise the UniformCommercial Code in an effort to give more muscle to shrink-wraplicenses.  Companies have had limited success in court enforcingsoftware licenses because the buyer is unable to bargain overterms and because some courts have found that the contracts arean impermissible endrun of the copyright act (See related storyin this issue.)Many companies are putting greater emphasis on protecting theirproducts through patents rather than or as a complement tocopyright.  This shift recognizes that courts have beenloosening restrictions over patents, while tightening therequirements for copyright, and that patents have a greatercertainty than copyright.  (It's generally easier to interpret apatent claim than to agree on copyright's coverage in software.)Finally, Congress may be getting into the act.  There's nothinglike lawmakers on the loose today to divert attention from courtdecisions tomorrow.  The Administration has proposed a series ofcopyright changes in response to the threat and opportunitypresented by digital technology.While parts of the legislative package are benign, it containsproposals that have already divided the computer and softwareindustry.  In some respects, the Administration attempts toaccomplish in Congress what the software industry'sprotectionist forces failed to do in court in issues involvinginteroperability, reverse engineering, and fair use.Over the next year, the time, energy, and money spent onlobbying Congress on these issues will likely dwarf whatever isdevoted to similar court fights.                             STASISPerhaps there isn't a blockbuster software case around thecorner because of a general comfort with the state of flux inthe law.  The sky has not fallen on the ultraprotectionists,despite rulings such as the 9th Circuit's Sega v.  Accoladedecision that allows reverse engineering under limitedcircumstances.  And neither has software become a giant visiblegrab bag, into which competitors can dip and choose the best andbrightest features of their competitors' products.  The 2ndCircuit's Computer Associates v.  Altai case lays out a broadmethodology other circuits are adopting to discover what is andis not protected.  It's a confusing murkiness that the industryseems to be learning to live with.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION LAW ALERT: A VOORHEES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 26, 1996Change In PlansCOMPUSERVE TO OFFER PARENTAL/USER CONTROLIN LIEU OF GERMAN BLOCK OUT OF NEWSGROUPSOnline provider does not want to face country-by-countrycensorship decisionsCompuServe is close to lifting its global ban on about 200Usenet groups that a German prosecutor said may violateantipornography laws and will put in place controls that willallow all its users--not just those in Germany--to block accesstoobjectionable material.CompuServe originally planned to block access to those groups toonly German subscribers but has backed away from that approachin favor of so-called parental controls."We're really hesitant to become the Baskin & Robins of onlineservice providers, providing a different flavor [of content] indifferent countries and cities," said Kent Stuckey, CompuServe'sbusiness development manager and former general counsel.At the end of 1995, CompuServe blocked all its customers fromaccessing the newsgroups, many dealing with sexually explicittopics and containing digital images of nasty stuff.  Thecompany said that it faced potential prosecution in Munich forcarrying the newsgroup.  Because CompuServe could nottechnically block access to those groups to German customers atthat time, it put a global ban in place.Earlier this month, CompuServe announced that it was developingthe technical ability to institute a ban limited only toGermany.  But Stuckey says that, upon reflection, that approachwon't work either technically or administratively.German users, for example, could access the system from a nodeoutside of Germany.  Moreover, it could force CompuServe toconfigure the content that flows through its system to thenational, regional, and local standards wherever it doesbusiness.Stuckey says it makes more sense to put controls in the hands ofthe end-user.  The controls will allow users to block materialthat comes from within the CompuServe system and also fromoutside the service, such as the Internet's multimediacomponent, the World Wide Web, and the Usenet discussion groupnetwork.  The blocking feature will be the digital equivalent ofbrown paper wrappers that cover the "adult" magazines atnewsstands.Stuckey says "we have reason to believe" that the controls willsatisfy the Munich prosecutor who was investigating the onlinepornography.  CompuServe has about 250,000 customers in Germany.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION LAW ALERT: A VOORHEES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 26, 1996Don't Post That CryptoTHE ZIMMERMANN IRONYGov't may be more likely to prosecute future casesin wake of its decision to leave PGP author aloneNearly five years after his popular encryption program PrettyGood Privacy was posted on the Internet, Phil Zimmermann hasdiscovered he won't be prosecuted for conspiring to export amunition.Ironically, the three-year investigation into Zimmermann mayactually increase the odds of a prosecution if strongcryptography is posted to an Internet site.  The internationalpublicity that has attended the Zimmermann investigation wouldmake it far harder for someone else to claim he or she wasunfamiliar with the government's concerns about the export ofcryptography.  "I think it would be easier to bring a case" ifthe posting occurred in 1996, said Ken Bass, a partner in theD.C. office of Venable, Baetjer.Moreover, in 1991, when PGP was posted to computer sites, therewas not nearly the awareness of the global reach of theInternet.Today, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology distributes anoncommercial version of PGP under a screening system thatlimits access to U.S. citizens.On January 11, William Keane, the federal prosecutor overseeingthe investigation, told Zimmermann's lead lawyer, Phil Dubois,that his client would not be prosecuted.Many individuals and computer companies believed the exportlaws under which Zimmermann might have been prosecuted should berelaxed to permit the free flow of strong cryptography.  Theybelieve cryptography enables free speech and that therestrictions hurt the U.S. software companies that must dumbdown their products for export.Like Bass, Dubois cautions that the decision not to prosecuteZimmermann, a folk here for many in the online and computerfields, should not be interpreted as a license to uploadtamper-proof crypto."Every year that goes by it strangely becomes more likely thatthere could be a prosecution" because of the growing awarenessof the issues of cryptography, national security, and export, hesaid.If the government prosecuted Zimmermann, it would have beenforced to argue that the mere posting of PGP on a domesticcomputer site qualifies as an export because it wasavailable--and found its way--overseas.  Prosecutors would alsohave to show that Zimmermann, a security consultant who lives inBoulder, Colorado, was acting in concert with the person whoposted the program.  Zimmermann himself says he did not post thesoftware.                         UNKNOWN CLIENTA California resident has taken credit for postingthe software in 1991 as a way to thwart legislation in Congressthat could have limited the availability of strong cryptography.In various postings and articles, Jim Warren, a Californiacomputer activist, journalist, and entrepreneur, has describedthis person's activities in uploading the software.Upon hearing that he would not be prosecuted, Zimmermann posteda note to an Internet mailing list for cryptographers.  Hethanked his legal team and also "Joe Burton, counsel for thecodefendant."Burton presumably represented this person during theinvestigation, apresumption Burton and Zimmermann's lawyers won't confirm.In a later message, Dubois also cited the help Burton, who isbased in San Francisco, provided.  "He represented anotherperson who was under investigation.  To have made this otherperson publicly known would have been an invasion of hisprivacy, so we didn't.  We still won't, but we can finallyacknowledge Mr. Burton's enormous contribution.  .  .  .  Mr.Burton labored quietly on behalf of his client.  He took thecase pro bono and did an extraordinary job."                              NEXTThe government isn't commenting on why it declined to prosecuteZimmermann.  One theory is that the government did not want atrial to serve as a springboard for a public debate on exportcontrols and cryptography.  Another is that officials did notwant to put the export control regime at risk in litigation.Zimmermann's lawyers would have argued that the lawunconstitutionally restricts speech.These issues are not going away.  Bass, one of Zimmermann'slawyers, is also representing Phil Karn, a engineer fromSouthern California, who has waged a challenge to exportcontrols on free-speech grounds.  The case involves Karn'sdesire to export a diskette that contains cryptographic sourcecode.  Although the government has permitted the export of abook containing the same code, it won't permit the disk to leavethese shores.  Judge Charles Richey of D.C. Circuit Court islikely to issue a ruling on the government's motion to dismissthe case or for summary judgment in the next few months.Separately, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is financing achallenge of the export control laws on behalf of a Universityof Chicago mathematics professor.  The suit challenges a sectionof the Arms Export Control Act and its implementing regulation.Daniel Bernstein filed suit after the State Departmentdetermined that he would have to register as an arms dealer andobtain a license in order to publish a scientific paper aboutand the source code for a cryptographic program, which isconsidered a munition.  The parties are awaiting the judge'sruling on dismissal.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION LAW ALERT: A VOORHEES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 26, 1996Lemon Into LemonadePHONE HOME, PROCDWisconsin judge rules that university student did not violateshrinkwrap license by placing phone directory on the InternetThere's already a front runner for the 1996 award for, dependingupon your mood, either turning lemons into lemonade or uncannytiming.ProCD of Danvers, Massachusetts, is almost a lock to win theaward for either its quick response to a court loss or itsprescient timing.The company last week announced that it would place 95 millionphone listings, which it sells as a CD-ROM product, on AmericaOnLine for customers to access.  "The main motivation for goingonline is to expose the product to more people," a ProCDspokesman.  "It's a brand-building project for us."What ProCD neglected to mention was that two weeks earlierfederal judge Barbara Crabb of Madison, Wisconsin, had ruledthat the company could not stop a university student fromplacing those listings on the Internet.  ProCD had sued MatthewZeidenberg, a University of Wisconsin computer science Ph.D.candidate, who had placed listings from ProCD's SelectPhoneCD-ROM program on his Internet site.The company sued Zeidenberg for copyright infringement.  In thecomplaint, ProCD briefly claimed that he had violated ProCD'scopyright in the listings themselves (a claim clearly at oddswith the Supreme Court's 1991 Feist decision), but devoted mostof its effort trying to show infringement of the softwareallowing users to access the listings.ProCD also claimed Zeidenberg violated the terms of theshrinkwrap license.Despite having issued a preliminary injunction againstZeidenberg late last year, judge Crabb concluded that copyrightlaw actually protected Zeidenberg's actions.ProCD will appeal the ruling and has asked that the dissolutionof the injunction be stayed.  Zeidenberg, meanwhile, ispreparing to resume his online phone directory.  His site wasgetting 20,000 "hits" a day before the court-ordered shutdown.Coming so closely on the heels of the court decision, ProCD'salignment with America OnLine looks like a way to manage theadverse decision.Not so, says Rob Levinson, the ProCD spokesman.  He says thatthe America OnLine deal was in the works long before the courtruling and that the two events are wholly unrelated.  Indeed,many companies have found that the Internet and online servicesprovide an opportunity for potential users to sampleslimmed-down versions of their product for free.                           SLAM DUNKFor example, America OnLine users can search the ProCD databaseonly by name, while licensed holders of the software can conductmuch more robust, granular searches.Users can identify, for example, neighbors of a particularperson, or search the entire database by street name, a usefulfeature if a voice-mail message is garbled.Nonetheless, Crabb's ruling is hardly welcome, if unsurprising,news for ProCD, for it permits licensed users of ProCD's productto extract all the names and addresses in the database, despitethe shrinkwrap license, which forbids such a practice.On each key point, she ruled in favor of Zeidenberg.She dispensed with ProCD's copyright claim in the underlyingdata in short order by citing the Feist decision, a caseinformed by "a nearly identical context."Nonetheless, Crabb displayed some ambivalence about thisoutcome.  She said there was "substantial equitable appeal" toProCD's argument that "it is unfair and commercially destructiveto allow defendants to take the information plaintiff hadassembled with a significant investment of time, effort andmoney."ProCD argued that Zeidenberg should not have copied the softwareonto his hard drive since that was not an "essential" step.  Thejudge disagreed:  "This conclusion conflicts with both basicpatterns of computer use in the 1990s" and copyright law, whichallows copies if they are an "essential step" in the use of theprogram.ProCD also argued that Zeidenberg should be bound by theshrinkwrap license, which says "you will not make the Softwareor the Listings in whole or in part available to any other userin any networked or time-shared environment, or transfer theListings in whole or in part to any computer other than thecomputer used to access the Listings."Crabb rejected that argument because Zeidenberg "did not receivethe opportunity to inspect or consider those terms" at the timeof the sale.  It didn't matter, the judge ruled, that Zeidenbergeventually bought a second and third copy of the program since"software companies are free to change the terms of theirshrinkwrap licenses between initial and later versions of theirproducts."Even if Zeidenberg had assented to the contract, it is preemptedby copyright law, Crabb ruled.The contract's "prohibition on the distribution of publicinformation cannot be squared with the purposes of copyright lawor with plaintiff's own compilation of data," she wrote, makinga special point of saying that ProCD is trying to close offopportunities to others that it once took advantage of.                             IRONY"Had each of the compilers of the 3,000 directories thatplaintiff used to put together its database attached a set ofterms prohibiting further distribution of the informationincluded in its directories, plaintiff would not have been ableto create SelectPhone without negotiating with and compensatingeach compiler for use of its data.  The Supreme Court's decisionin Feist allowed plaintiff to avoid these problems and createits database without any fear of copyright infringement.  It isironic that after plaintiff has attained the benefits ofcopyright law, it wants to prevent others from receiving thatsame protection."Coda:  The case was a maiden court voyage for David Austin,Zeidenberg's lawyer.  He had been admitted to the bar the day tooriginal complaint was filed.For the appeal, Zeidenberg will be relying on Austin andanother lawyer, Keith Napolitano, who is now in business school.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION LAW ALERT: A VOORHEES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 26, 1996Photo WarsCOPYRIGHT REGS ON PHOTO REGISTRATIONHAS PHOTOGRAPHERS, FINISHERS AT ODDSDeposit-less registration proposal is running into oppositionA proposed Copyright Office regulation allowing photographersto register photographs depositing copies of them.  The proposalis intended to encourage the registration of photographs but iscausing anxiety among photofinishers, who fear that they willsuddenly be liable for statutory damages and attorney's fees ifthey reproduce a registered photo."I believe in the principle of copyright law.  No one shouldtake the work of an artist, in this case, a photographic artist,an make an income from it without compensating the maker.  But,if grandma wants to have a copy made of a photograph she has ofher grandchild for her own personal use, should this be aprosecutable offense?  I don't think so," wrote Henry Oles,president of EPS Photographic of San Marcos, Texas, in commentsto the office.Representatives of the photo industry say that photofinishersare blowing the proposal out of proportion.  They say theproposed regulations, which they urged upon the office, are arealistic way to give photographers the advantages ofregistration without undue burden.  Few photographs arecurrently registered, often because the photographer does notknow which of thousands of images may eventually be published.It would also be expensive to register the photos individually.Even though the proposed regulations would make it easier forphotographers to win statutory damages and attorneys' fees,those awards are unlikely except in case of misconduct, arguesCharles Ossola of Lowe Price LeBlanc & Becker, counsel for theAmerican Society of Media Photographers.  "There is no basis foranyone who acts in good faith to worry about statutory damages,"Ossola said.Ossola notes that the photo industry had strongly supportedefforts in the last Congress to relax registration requirements.Under the proposal, a photographer can register a group ofphotos taken within a year under a single title, provided he orshe provides basic identifying information about the photos.The Library of Congress may request to view 50 to 100 of theregistered photos and select five to ten images from each groupregistration.  The photos comprising the group don't necessarilyhave to be of the same subject material.Photofinishers feel they have been double-crossed.  This summer,the industry published voluntary guidelines on copyrightprotection that were meant to discourage litigation and protectinnocent infringers from damages.  The proposed regs, they say,undercuts the guidelines.  "Many in the industry felt this was alandmark agreement we could work with.  Now before thisagreement has been tried, the Copyright Office is proposing togive photographers new incentives to sue," wrote John Heafield,president of Photofast One Hour Photo in Birmingham, Michigan.Comments on the proposal are due at the Copyright OfficeFebruary 9.  The deadline was pushed back twice.  At press time,most of the nearly two dozen comments received opposed thechange, but Ossola's group and the other trade associationsrepresenting photographers had yet to weigh in.Ossola played down the possibility that photographers would tryto abuse the relaxed registration requirements.  "If you go tocourt and commit perjury, you get in trouble," he said.In the Federal Register, the Copyright Office said photographers"need relief now."  An official at the Copyright Office declinedto speculate on when a decision on whether to issue theregulation may be made.  The proposed regs originally weresupposed to be issued as "interim" regs, meaning they would takeeffect immediately, but photofinishers were able to change thatat the last minute.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION LAW ALERT: A VOORHEES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 26, 1996Learning To Live TogetherPRETTY GOOD GUIDELINESThe photo industry's copyright guidelines provide usefulinsights for online communityEditor's note:  Over the summer, after protracted negotiation,the photo industry released voluntary guidelines on theprotection of copyright.  They set out responsibilities thatphotographers and photo finishers agreed to assume in order toprotect the livelihood of photographers and minimize the risk oflitigation for photo finishers.The guidelines are remarkably adaptable to the online industry,which is struggling with similar issues.  The roles of onlineservice providers and photo finishers, for example, are closelyjoined.  Thousands of copyrighted works pass through the portalsof providers and finishers each day.  There often is little orno opportunity to check that the customers are the rightfulowners of the works.A useful exercise is to replace the phrase "photo finisher" and"photo processor" with "online service provider" and"photograph" with the more general "content" in the guidelines,reprinted below.The Board of Directors of the American Society of MediaPhotographers, the Professional Photographers of America, PhotoMarketing Association International, the Association ofProfessional Color Laboratories, the Professional SchoolPhotographers Association International, and the Coalition forConsumers' Picture Rights, adopt the following guidelinesconcerning copyright practice for members of the photo industry.All members of the Photo Industry should:1.  Recognize the photographer or studio as the owner ofcopyright in his or her photographs in most circumstances,particularly in the case of professional portraits.2.  Encourage greater enjoyment of photography through the useof photographs, made in compliance with applicable laws.3.  Encourage all members of the photo industry to educate andinform their customers and employees of the requirements of thecopyright laws and the need for adherence to and support ofthose laws.  This should include working to educate the publicthat the purchaser of a photograph does not automatically obtainthe right to make copies.4.  Provide reasonable notice to customers that the permissionof the photographer is necessary under federal copyright law inmost circumstances for copying or other manipulation of aphotograph.5.  Support and work together to obtain amendment of theCopyright Act to eliminate copyright registration as aprecondition for statutory damages and attorneys' fees in casesinvolving photographs, provided, however, that the amendmentsalso bar any award of statutory damages or attorneys' fees forinnocent infringement.  The parties will work together and withCongress to make clear the meaning of "innocent infringement."6.  Recognize that when infringement occurs that's not innocent,statutory damages and attorneys' fees may be awarded.Substantial awards should be made in cases of willfulinfringement, or repeat infringement after notice.  Whereinfringement is innocent, no statutory damages or attorneys'fees should be awarded.7.  Endorse the development of a voluntary identification systemfor copyrighted photos so that labs and other users may properlylocate, seek permission from, and compensate copyright ownersfor their copyrighted work.8.  Work together to promote the growth of the industry andensure that new imaging technologies are used in responsibleways consistent with the rights of all concerned.In addition, photographers should:1.  Prior to completion of the sales process, provide notice tocustomers of the photographer's ownership of copyright, in aneffort to avoid confusion about the rights of the photographer.2.  Provide customers with the information necessary to obtainadditional copies of the photographs.3.  Where reasonably possible, identify and mark theirphotographs sufficiently to permit others to know whom tocontact to obtain permission to copy, electronically orotherwise manipulate, or prepare other derivative uses of thephoto.4.  Respond promptly to requests for permission to copy,electronically or otherwise manipulate, or prepare otherderivative uses of the photo, although there is no obligation togrant such permission.5.  Give written notice to the photo processor when aphotographer believes his or her copyright has been infringed,in an effort to prevent further infringement, to determine thecause of the alleged infringement, and to permit possibleresolution of the matter without the need for litigation.In addition, photo processors should:1.  Notify customers that the photo processor does not copy ormanipulate photos bearing a copyright notice without thepermission of the copyright owner named in the notice.2.  Provide notice to customers, where practicable, thatcopyrighted photographs will not be accepted without thepermission of the photographer (e.g., "No Copyrighted Photos"),when photo processors use promotional techniques, such as mailorder and drop boxes that are within their control.  Where thepromotional techniques are not within the control of the photoprocessor, the person in control should be requested to providesuch notice.3.  Educate and inform responsible employees about theirresponsibilities under copyright law and established policiesand practices.4.  Inspect the front and back of photographs submitted forcopying to determine if a copyright notice or other notice thatthe work is professional (such as a studio name or logo) ispresent or appears to have been removed.  In either event, thephoto processor should decline to copy or manipulate thephotograph unless the customer reasonably establishes thatcopying is permissible.5.  Inspect the front and back of an unmarked image submittedfor copying to determine if it is reasonably recognizable as aprofessional photograph.  Questionable cases should be separatedfrom routine orders and brought to management's attention.Reasonable efforts should be made to determine whether the imageis a professional image.6.  Utilize the following guidelines in evaluating a request tocopy photographs which the photo processor has reason to believemay be professional.a.  It is generally reasonable for a photo processor to rely ona written consent to copying or other manipulation from thephotographer or studio named in a copyright notice or othermarking.b.  Where the image is identified as a professional photographby a mark, or it reasonably appears that a mark has been alteredor removed, it generally is not reasonable to rely solely onstatements by customers claiming a right to copy the photograph.c.  Where there is no marking identifying a photograph as aprofessional photograph, but there is a question about whetherthe photograph is professional, it is generally reasonable for aphoto processor to rely on a written statement by the customerthat the customer understands that copies must be authorized bythe photographer and that he or she is the photographer, or hasreceived such authorization.d.  Circumstances such as prior written warnings from aphotographer or prior dealings with a customer may indicate thatfurther confirmation is necessary.e.  Copying or restoring a photograph for the personal use of acustomer may be reasonable in cases where the age of thephotograph or the circumstances are such that the photographeror studio is unlikely to object to copying and all reasonableefforts have been made to obtain permission from thephotographer.  The industry will work together to developfurther guidelines for such copying.7.  Document a claim of "fair use" in writing by an identifiedcustomer, with a description of a legitimate fair use, and thecopy or manipulation should be appropriate and limited to thefair use purpose which is claimed.  The industry will worktogether to develop further guidelines for such copying.  Theseguidelines are not intended to strengthen or weaken the doctrineof fair use as incorporated in the Copyright Act and asdeveloped by the courts.General:These guidelines only deal with activities by industry membersand are not intended to excuse or mitigate customer infringementliability under current copyright law.  While the customers'knowledge and application of copyright law and practices mayhave a significant impact on the industry, guidelines for thecustomers' behavior are not provided.  An industry member'sefforts to follow these guidelines should be viewed on their ownmerits.The Photo Industry agrees to work together to develop furtherguidelines and practices relating to:1.  Practical and effective means of identifying photographs asprofessional photographs.2.  Standardized copyright warnings.3.  "Fair use" copying.4.  Restoration and copying of photographs where the age of thephotograph or the circumstances are such that the photographeror studio is unlikely to object to copying.5.  Processing of undeveloped customer film on automatedequipment, where determination of the content of the latentimages and the detection of infringement may not be possible.THESE GUIDELINES ARE PREMISED ON THE BELIEF THAT LITIGATION ISDETRIMENTAL TO THE PHOTO INDUSTRY, AND FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINESWILL HELP AVOID IT.  THE GUIDELINES RECOMMEND TO THE COURTS THATIN CASES WHERE AN INFRINGEMENT HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE OCCURRED,THE EXTENT OF THE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS BY THE PARTIES TO FOLLOWTHESE GUIDELINES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER THEINFRINGEMENT IS INNOCENT, NEGLIGENT OR WILLFUL.Photo WarsBack to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION LAW ALERT: A VOORHEES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 26, 1996No SecretsUNDAUNTED BY CRYPTO LITIGATION, CYLINK PLANS IPODespite a 1 1/2-year-old court battle with onetime partner RSAData Security that gets topsier and turvier by the month, CylinkCorp. is planning to go public.The Sunnyvale, California, company bares all about its fightwith RSA in documents now on file with the Securities andExchange Commission.  RSA and Cylink are fighting over thebreakup of their patent pool that once controlled all the keypatents teaching public key cryptography, a bedrock upon whichelectronic commerce will be built, if it is to be built at all. They are at odds in four suits and an arbitration, allinvolving the validity of licensing of patents.  Cylink playsdown a negative outcome in any of the disputes, except oneinvolving the so-called Schnorr patent that RSA, a sublicensee,claims covers the U.S. government's digital signature standard.Cylink is seeking a ruling that a license for the patent is notneeded to build DSS equipment but acknowledges that its businesscould be "materially and adversely affected" by a loss in thatcase.Cylink, which reported sales of $26 million during the firstnine months of 1995, hopes to raise nearly $50 million throughthe sale of 5 million shares, or about 18 percent of thecompany.  RSA has also reportedly considered a public offering.It's no wonder.

on a popular method ofcompressing data was causing anxiety and anger in those sectionsof the online community unaccustomed to concerning themselveswith patents.  (Unisys has quietly been signing licensees,including America OnLine, Prodigy, Software Publishing Corp.,Symantec, Sierra Semiconductor, Goldstar, and 3Com Corp.)The International Trademark Association formed a task force toidentify and examine the difficulties in protecting corporateidentities on the Internet.  Several recent cases had exposedthe conflicts between trademark law, which is based on afirst-to-use basis, and the registration of Internet addresses,which occurs on a first-applied, first-registered basis withoutregard to trademark rights.  (InterNIC, the government-fundedentity registry of Internet addresses, has revised its policy ofassigning names, but the changes provided cold comfort totrademark owners.)Lawyers for Phil Zimmermann, the inventor of PGP, met with theU.S. Attorney's office in San Jose in an attempt to ward off anindictment.

But if you must use fax totransfer long, confidential documents, 3D Fax provides aninteresting way to do it better.                    ==========================     We're certain that e (for "electronic") mail will be themost important mode of non-verbal law office communications someday soon. It might have happened much sooner had inexpensive andeasy to use "fax" machines not arisen to take e-mail's rightfulplace in the communications pantheon.  But fax is only as secureas the sending and receiving machines and all you get is a papercopy of whatever message or document was sent; if you want torevise the document, you still have to get it into your computer.     This week we'll look at 3D Fax Professional, a program thatconverts computer files of all sorts to easily faxable graphics,then reads the graphics and converts them back to computer files.The program is not particularly easy to work with, but maypresent a solution, of sorts, to some of the inherent weaknessesof the fax communication process.[3D Fax]     3D Fax Professional converts any computer file, including aword processor or spreadsheet document or even a program, toblocks of gray looking graphics, and eventually converts thosegraphics blocks back to its original form.  The program'sstandard format divides the 8-1/2 by 11 inch page into quarters,with one  block occupying each quarter. A "fast" mode, usableonly in computer to computer setups, sends one large block oneach page.     The user can send a graphics file from a computer fax cardto the recipient's computer fax board, or to the recipient's faxmachine.  If the latter, the recipient must scan the fax printoutto her computer, using a minimum of a 300 dots per inch (dpi)scanner; the manual suggests a Hewlett Packard Scanner orcompatible, or any scanner conforming to the Twain standard.[Installation / Documentation / Support]      An automatic installation program run under Windows 95placed about 1.25 Megabytes of programs and sample data on ourhard disk.  For some reason, 3D Fax wouldn't work with TSFax fromCommworks, fax support program we had been using.   Customersupport suggested we re-install the fax software; instead, weinstalled Delrina's WinFax Pro 4, which worked withoutdifficulty.     Toll free telephone support is available Monday throughSaturday from 7:00 AM to Midnight, Eastern time, however themanual notes that the service is free only for two calls, at amaximum of 10 minutes each.  In fact, we called several timeswithout difficulty.  The first time we called, the support personcould not answer our questions, took our telephone number andcalled back with the answers a couple of hours later.     A 150 page manual and good Windows help system providedreasonable documentation.[Using 3D Fax]     3D Fax comes with a "macro installer" which provides macrosto use the program with Ami Pro, WordPerfect, or Microsoft Word 2or 6.  (The installed doesn't really install a macro forWordPerfect, but does tell the user how to do it.) We didn'tbother with these frills, but proceeded to work with files we hadpreviously saved.     We loaded the 3D Fax "Send" module and selected the file wewished to send.  3D Fax converted the file and "sent" it to thepreviously selected WinFax Pro, launching that program.  We gavethe fax program the phone number of the intended recipient andthe graphics file was sent to the recipient fax machine.  We thenattempted to fax the pages back to the computer, but the 3D Fax"Receive" module was unable to deal with those files.  We triedprinting the original graphics file to our laser printer andfaxing that back to the computer, but that didn't work either.     The publisher told us a 300 dpi scanner was required.  Wehooked one up and after some image adjustment were able to dealboth with the laser printed and  faxed version.  We're not surewhy a 300 dpi scanner is needed to scan what is basically no morethan a 200 dpi fax paper printout, but that appears to be thecase.  We were not able to achieve 100 percent results, andsometimes had to rescan the faxed printout to obtain the resultswe wanted.     Reading the scanned file required firing up the 3D FaxReceive module, selecting the scanned file, then saving thereconverted files back to our hard disk.[Computer to Computer]     Fax card to fax card operation worked without fail.  Weachieved the same result by converting a computer file to the 3DFax format and simply sending the file as a binary file, thenreconverting with the Read module.     The vendor claims advantages of compression in conversionfrom computer file to graphics.  To test this we created a 50page ASCII text file, approximately 149,300 bytes long.  We ranthis file through 3D Fax Send and WinFax Pro 4, ending up with a52 kilobyte graphics file which faxed to 3 pages of four blockseach, and a last page consisting of one block. The full pagestook about 70 seconds, each, to fax from computer to a faxmachine, or less than five minutes for the entire package.Faxing the 50 pages of text would have taken the better part ofan hour; of course, sending the uncompressed text file betweentwo 14,400 kilobit per second modems would have taken less thanthree minutes. With standard compression, we might have reducedtransmission time to less than a minute.     3D Fax Pro also boasts a password security feature. Thepublisher is quick to note that the program does not use the 8character password to encrypt the file as it converts it tographics, but merely sets the header to require the passwordbefore 3D Fax will reconvert the file to its original computerformat.  We assume that one out of three high school studentscould easily bypass the password requirement, but it should besufficient to prevent most secretaries and mail room attendantsfrom viewing the text until the password is supplied.     3D Fax comes in three flavors: a free version has a limitedSend module, but can receive from all versions of the product.  Aone hundred dollar "standard" version is not limited in the sizeof the file that may be sent, but does not have the password,compression, redundancy and other advanced features of the twohundred dollar "professional" version.     3D Fax adds security, cuts transmission time, permitstransfer of computer programs and complex data, as well asletters and contracts, over common phone lines to unattended faxmachines maintained by clients and other attorneys who are notyet equipped for e-mail.  Of course, a scanner will be needed atthe other end to actually read the text.  We still prefer e-mail,but if your correspondents don't, we suggest you play with a copyof the free version of 3D Fax and see whether it meets yourneeds, and theirs.[Details]     3D Fax Professional, Version 1.5.

According to the preface, Computer Crime, the book,began life as an FBI training manual. The book is authoritativeand reads well, and  includes listings of state and federalcomputer crime laws, a sample search warrant, instructions on howto execute the warrant, how to obtain computer evidence(including evidence on how and why to gather than computer itselfas evidence).  We don't agree with all of the advice, but suspectthat the book will be getting wide circulation in law enforcementcircles, making it particularly important for lawyers on "theother side".[Details]     Computer Crime, a Crimefighter's Handbook, by David Icove,Karl Seger and William VonStorch. 437 pages, paper.

Following the collapse of merger talks withShutts & Bowen, one of Florida's best-known firms, the firm decided toclose its doors permanently at the end of 1995.The 75-year-old practice, which had three offices in its home state aswell as an office in London, employed over 100 lawyers at its heightbut this number has dwindled in recent years. At the time of theannouncement, it is estimated that there were about 50 lawyers employedin the firm.According to marketing director Angela Spall, the firm suffered frominvoluntary downsizing in recent years from several rounds ofdefections to rival firms including Shutts & Bowen. The defections mayhave been the result of a lack of direction within the firm."It was a very democratic firm and it was hard for one group to managewell." said Spall. "It was like herding cats. There was no strongvisionary leader and too many agendas."The final blowThe final blow came in September when the entire trust and statedepartment, which was regarded as the firm's flagship, left to set up anew firm, Dunwody White & Landen."After that, the firm did not have the right mix of practice group,"Spall commented. Other key practice areas within the practice werelitigation, tax and health care.Before winding up operations, Mershon Sawyer approached several firmsin the city about the possibility of a merger, including litigationpractice Tew & Beasely and Shutts & Bowen. It was the final blow whenthe Shutts & Bowen talks broke down and management responded by votingto dissolve. The chairman of the executive committee at Shutts & Bowen,Bowman Brown, reported that a lawyer who had moved to Shutts & Bowenfrom Mershon Sawyer approached the management committee concerning amerger. The proposal was considered because Mershon Sawyer was a wellrespected firm.However, Bowman said that discussions never went beyond thepreliminaries. "We reviewed the situation with a consultant and decidedthat we already provided the services that they provide and saw nosignificant advantage in a merger," said Bowman.Strong financial positionThe perception in some quarters was that the talks fell through becauseMershon Sawyer had made too many demands. However, Spall noted that thefirm was negotiating from a strong financial position:"The firm'sproblems were not financial. We were very stable financially and heldon to our institutional clients." Clients included Citibank, FirstUnion National Bank, Mercedez-Benz, Chrysler and Miami University.The fate of the lawyers working in Mershon Sawyer's offices outsideMiami is secure. The London operations were acquired by another Miami-based firm Steel Hector & Davis, and the 11-lawyer West Palm Beachoffice was bought out by Orlando firm Akerman Senterfit. The Naplesoffice has opted to go on its own and the Key West office is a one-person operation.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Their arrivalstrengthens the German contingent in Beijing where Punder Volhard Weber& Axster, among the first batch of foreign law firms to enter thecountry, had been the sole representative for several years.According to Juergen Burkhardt, who will be heading Beiten Burkhardt'soperations in Beijing, German industry is very aware of theopportunities to be gleaned in China, an awareness which was furtherheightened by Chancellor Kohl's recent visit.Along with Burkhardt, there will be a Chinese-qualified lawyer and aGerman-qualified lawyer on board. The office will mainly be involvedwith negotiating joint ventures for German companies and has gainedsome work through one of Germany's leading banks Bayerische-Vereinsbank. The China venture will be complemented by a new Hong Kongoffice which opened at the same time.Strategically, Burkhardt sees the move as beneficial for his firm withChina's economy set to explode over the next few decades. "Europeanindustry has to benefit from the low labour costs and huge markets."But there is a learning curve. Burkhardt believes that the ChineseGovernment has become more restrictive in an effort to channelinvestment with the result that growth may be limited. "We will have tobe patient," he said."Chinese are not used to the accounting system,they are not used to working in a strict and orderly fashion - we allhave to adjust."Schulz Noack Barwinkel is a small Hamburg firm whose arrival shows thatinterest in China is high among law firms of every size.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Butinternational lawyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude."The parliamentary elections are unlikely to have a substantial effecton foreign investment," noted Jacky Baudon, managing partner at theMoscow office of UK firm Freshfields. "The presidential elections inJune and the election of the regional governors over 1996 should bemore telling."LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae's resident partner Brian Zimbler iskeeping a close eye on the situation: "We are continuing to see a largeflow of investment and we understand that there will be political upsand downs. The results are the sign of the difficulties of conversionto a market economy."Glenn Faass of Canadian firm Macleod Dixon said it is unlikely that acommunist president will be elected in June, but if it should arise,the situation would be more difficult. But how much more difficult isnot easy to determine. "It is not clear what the communists arestanding for," said Fass. "They seem to sell a message to the audiencethat the audience wants to hear."LeBoeuf's Zimbler recently attended a meeting with Gennady Zyuganov,the head of the Communist Party, and found him to be conciliatory toforeign investment: "So if you take him at his word, there should benothing to worry about."This is good news, but Faass warned:"The next six months will be aperiod of uncertainty, and foreign investors who do not have to spendmoney will not. This may turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy,because if foreign investors do not continue to show support forreform, then the voters may look the other way."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightLAWYER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EUROPE:  COURT RULES ON ESTABLISHMENTWith the European Commission about to report to the European Parliamenton the draft directive on the rights of establishment of lawyers, theEuropean Court of Justice has confirmed that lawyers may, in somecircumstances, set up in another member state under home title withoutever having to register with the local bar association.The court ruled in favour of a German lawyer who had been preventedfrom operating in Italy by the Milan Bar Association.Reinhard Gebhard, who is registered as a German rechtsanwalt inStuttgart, had operated in Italy since 1978. However, the Milan BarAssociation initiated disciplinary proceedings against him. Itreproached him for using the term "avvocato" and designating his officeas "Studio Legale Gebhard".The Italian authorities sought an interpretation of the 1977 Directiveon Lawyers' Services and Article 52 of the Treaty of Rome, particularlyfocusing on when a member state could intervene to regulate activities.The court determined that this could not be done unless a number ofconditions were met to justify that the restrictions were in the publicinterest.The judgment is being hailed as a victory for the liberalinterpretation of establishment rights which won the overwhelmingsupport of European lawyers at the November meeting of the CCBE inDresden. At that meeting, lawyers voted in favour of a permanent rightof establishment under home title against opposition from the French,Spanish and Luxembourg bar delegations.Patrick Oliver, the Brussels representative of the Law Society ofEngland and Wales, said bar associations will now have to look at whatactivities are being performed by foreign lawyers to determine whichconditions are reasonable or not. It is likely the French will put up avigorous defence to show that restrictions in French law are compatiblewith the public interest.The judgment strongly suggests, however, that it would be unreasonablefor a bar association to seek registration for a lawyer who ispractising his own or EC law in another member state. But, Olivercautioned, the judgment is "fairly general and only gives pointers withregard to the establishment debate". It does not, for example, givespecific details on when a local bar can seek registration.But he added that the legal position"is becoming clearer and clearer",something that has eluded European lawyers for the last decade.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"The situation is that the licence entitles you to advise onlaw in which your lawyers are licensed," Zimbler said. "Nevertheless,the situation is not really that clear, it is clear that the governmentis recognising us officially. Yet it is not clear how the licence worksand the scope of the licence is also unclear."Another lawyer, however, whose firm has also applied for the licence,looks on the confusion in a different light and believes the lack ofclarity is just an excuse made up by some firms which did not want tocomply."Public policy requires that one must impose guidelines on the legalprofession and Russia has been one of the last countries to do so," hesaid."Indeed, the restrictions are less onerous than in thejurisdictions that the people who are complaining about the rules comefrom."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Previously, solicitors were only allowed to beappointed district judges, the lowest ranking judge in Ireland.The decision comes after a heated debate between the rival professionalbodies governing solicitors and barristers with the donning bysolicitor-judges of the judge's wig forming a major stumbling block.In the event, the original government proposal - that solicitors beeligible for direct appointment to the higher court benches - was watered down to the general satisfaction of the barristers.James Nugent, chairman of the Irish Bar which represents barristers, ishappy with the decision. However, the law society's attorney general,Ken Murphy, merely looks on the decision "as a small step in the rightdirection".With countries such as the UK, Australia and New Zealand allowing thedirect appointment of solicitors to the upper reaches of the bench, thesolicitors are likely to continue pressing for change."To excludesolicitors from judicial positions is a relic of history and worksagainst the public interest," Murphy said.With both sides lobbing well-worn arguments back and forth, a workinggroup is to be set up by the government to monitor the progress andsuggest changes. Representatives from both professional groups andthird party observers will sit on it.Nugent does not foresee that there will be further change in the nextfew years.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightLAWYER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDSBob Gordon of Hanover Park Legal Services discusses important areas ofrisk to partners and partnerships that are rarely considered until itis too lateALL PARTNERSHIPS are potentially exposed to a reduction in cashflow bythe temporary absence of a partner. And while the absentee's workloadmight be spread among his or her colleagues in the short term, longer-term cashflow inevitably suffers.The following four examples highlight the risks and the importance forlaw firms to secure appropriate insurance cover.Example: A partner is expected to generate fees of about #300,000($500,000) during the next 12 months. None of the individual colleagueseither possesses the skill or has the confidence of clients that wouldallow the practice to generate this income in the partner's absence. Ifthe lawyer is ill, he or she will receive an income of #100,000 perannum during the first 12 months of absence.The exposure of the practice is therefore the lost fees of #300,000,plus the #100,000 that the partner will receive at a time when they aregenerating no income - a total of #400,000. This is bound to have animpact on the income of the other partners, who must shoulder theresulting financial burden. If spread among ten partners, the costwould be #40,000 each.The partnership also risks having to buy out colleagues who retire dueto ill-health. The sources of credit available to partnerships are lessextensive than those to which incorporated companies can turn and,unlike companies, partnerships do not have large amounts of liquidassets on the balance sheet which can be used to pay a "golden good-bye".Example: A partner suffers a stroke and can no longer perform demandingduties. The fellow partners must buy him out, each paying #300,000.There are two sources of finance available: personal assets or borrowedmoney. The former eats into personal hard-won wealth, while the lattercreates a debt to be serviced and repaid.The above problems also affect individual partners, especially where adisabled partner has skills not possessed by his or her colleagues orwhose personal contacts generate income.The major partner risk, however, relates to permanent incapacity.Senior lawyers will normally be taxed under Schedule D. Being self-employed, they cannot participate in an occupational pension scheme,but will instead have personal pensions to provide income afterretiring.Two factors create a considerable risk:* Contributions payable under a personal pension are restricted by theInland Revenue. One would have to contribute the maximum possibleamount for many years before a large fund would have accrued.* Such a fund would be used to purchase an annuity, the "cash forpension exchange rate", which will be principally determined by theindividual's age. The younger the person, the worse the annuity rate,and thus the lower the pension.The younger one is, therefore, the smaller the pension fund and theworse the annuity rate. Solicitors are in a precarious position when itcomes to early retirement enforced by ill-health.Example: A 50-year-old partner has to retire due to ill-health. He haspaid maximum contributions allowed by the Inland Revenue and hasamassed a pension of #300,000. The annuity rate for a 50-year-oldprovides a"cash for pension exchange rate" of 30:1. A fund of #300,000therefore provides a pension of only #10,000 per annum. This is 10percent of his pre-disability income of #100,000.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightLAWYER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EC ISSUES DRAFT ON BANKING DIRECTIVEThe European Commission has just published a draft communication on twokey aspects of the Second Banking Directive (89/646/EEC). Chris Ffinchof Cameron Markby Hewitt, Brussels, explains its implicationsTHE DRAFT communication on the Second Banking Directive defines whatamounts to providing cross-border services, and also provides guidanceabout what restrictions host states may impose on banks as being in the"general good".The Second Banking Directive came into force on January 1 1993. Itprovides for a single EU-wide banking authorisation (or "passport").This allows for a streamlined notification procedure when creditinstitutions - and in some cases their banking subsidiaries - wish toconduct banking activities across borders (right to provide services)or to establish a branch in another member state (right ofestablishment).All a credit institution's banking activities throughout the EU aresubject to supervision by the authorities in the member state where itshead office is located. This is known as "Home State Control"."Host States" - member states where a bank exercises its right ofestablishment or its right to provide services - have very limitedsupervisory functions. They can only insist that a "foreign" creditinstitution operating there complies with certain rules - rules whichthey have to justify as being "in the general good".The draft begins by reminding readers that all credit institutions mustcomply with the notification procedure laid down in the directivebefore they start to provide cross-border services. It then commentsthat, since the obligation is to notify only when cross-border servicesare carried on for the first time, some credit institutions may notneed to go through this procedure.These exemptions are for credit institutions which had carried on cross-border services before the directive came into force, even if bankingservices were only provided on one occasion. The only condition thecommission would impose is that the provision of such cross-borderservices must have been lawful.What is cross-border banking?The draft then examines exactly what amounts to providing cross-borderbanking services. It considers that this can be done in three ways.The first is where there is "movement on the part of the serviceprovider", that is, the credit institution itself. This would, forexample, include where deposits are accepted in a different memberstate other than through a subsidiary or branch. Deposits - or morelikely perhaps withdrawals - might be made from an electronic machine.Alternatively, the credit institution might send its ownrepresentatives for a short period to another member state, or it mighttemporarily appoint a local agent there.The second possibility is where it is the customer who "moves". Thedraft considers that, where a customer leaves his state of residenceand obtains banking services from a credit institution in anothermember state, there may be provision of cross-border services - butonly if he has been subject to "commercial canvassing".In effect, where the customer acts on his own initiative, nonotification is necessary. On the other hand, if there has beencommercial canvassing by the credit institution in the member state ofthe customer's residence, it has conducted cross-border servicesbusiness there. This way of providing services is likely to come as anunwelcome surprise to some banks. Many have been under the impressionthat, as long as they do not move any of their operations abroad, theyhave not conducted cross-border business.The third way in which cross-border services can be provided is whereit is the service itself which moves. This covers what the draft calls"modern" means of communication, such as the telephone, fax, telex andelectronic mail.Again, the draft distinguishes between whether the service is providedon the customer's initiative, or whether it follows commercialcanvassing by the credit institution in the state where the customerresides.Advertising or canvassing?The draft states clearly that canvassing amounts to providing cross-border banking services. It reasons that canvassing amounts to anintention to carry on cross-border services, therefore a notificationis necessary. This must be questionable. Effectively, a mere offer toprovide services is treated identically to actually providing thoseservices.The draft then attempts to explain what canvassing is. It comments thatadvertising is not necessarily canvassing, although making thedistinction is not always easy. The starting point is that advertisingis "simple promotion". Canvassing, on the other hand, can be one of twoactivities.First, it is where an advertisement is placed and is followed by ajourney to the member state concerned by the credit institution inorder to conclude a contract. So, where a credit institution places anadvertisement and intends to follow this up with a visit to theconsumer's state of residence, it provides cross-border services. Itmust go through the notification procedure before contacting theconsumer.The other way of canvassing is to issue an "actual invitation", at adistance, to enter into a contract. According to the draft, an actualinvitation is an advertisement which contains sufficient information(e.g. as to interest rate, duration and cost) for the consumer to beable to make up his mind, or one in which, thanks to the methods used,it is possible to conclude the contract at a distance (e.g. by replyslip or telephone).So, if an advertisement does not contain sufficient information for thecontract to be concluded without the consumer needing physically tovisit the credit institution, it cannot be an "actual invitation". Theadvertisement does not amount to canvassing.This is not an easy test to apply. What amounts to sufficientinformation for one customer is not necessarily sufficient for another.The test also seems unnecessarily strict; there is a danger that, byincluding what it considers to be no more than minimal details and acontact telephone number in an advert published in another memberstate, a credit institution may be considered to be carrying onservices business there.What credit institutions see as no more than a routine advertisingcampaign may amount to canvassing and necessitate a notification.Provision of services and establishmentDifferent notifications are necessary, depending on whether the creditinstitution wishes to set up a branch in the host state, or to conductcross-border services there. Again, distinguishing these two is notalways easy.The main conceptual difference is that providing service is moretemporary in nature, whereas establishing a physical presence in theform of a branch has more of an air of permanence, But there is noreason why cross-border services should not be provided permanently.The draft focuses on a number of problem areas. One is independentintermediaries. The key issues are how much authority theintermediaries have to bind the credit institution, and how muchfreedom they have. This freedom relates both to the extent to whichthey are subject to the control of the credit institution (the more,the more likely it is to be a branch) and the extent to which they arefree to bind the credit institution in relation to third parties(again, the more, the more likely it is to be a branch).In order to be a branch, there must also be an element of permanence.The draft provides a cursory review of the case law and concludes that,in order to be considered a branch, an independent intermediary mustact exclusively for a single credit institution, must be able tonegotiate on behalf of the credit institution and commit the latter,and must operate on a permanent basis.This conclusion is open to question. Certainly, case law does notreally support the exclusivity point; in fact, it seems rather tocontradict it.Where an office is staffed by the credit institution's own staff, thedraft communication states that a distinction must be made. Where thestaff carry on banking activities, it is likely to be a branch. On theother hand, where they are simply part of a contact (representative)office, it is probably not a branch.Finally, the draft discusses the consequences of a failure by thecredit institutions to notify, and the consequences of the wrong typeof notification. It considers that notification is an administrativeprocedure and cannot have an impact on the validity of any bankingcontracts.The general goodThe Second Banking Directive states that credit institutions operatingeither a branch or by way of cross-border services must obey the rulesof the host state adopted in the interest of the general good.The first main difficulty is that the draft confirms that, under EClaw, member states do not have to provide details of exactly what theserules are. Clearly, this does not make complying with them any easier.A more robust approach from the commission would be welcome.The draft communication reviews the case-law relating to the generalgood and confirms that any such measure must:* protect the general good;* be non-discriminatory and apply to the host state's "own" creditinstitutions as well as to"foreign institutions"; and* be proportionate to the objective pursued. It should be noted thatprovisions in the general good cannot be applied to areas which havealready been harmonised, such as in relation to the solvency ratio orlarge exposures. This would amount to duplication.Examples of rules protecting the general good include consumerprotection, the prevention of fraud, the cohesion of the taxationsystem and protection of the reputation of the national financialservices industry.The draft also highlights what is often overlooked. In assessing theproportionality (a sort of reasonableness test) of a host state'srestrictions, a different measure applies, depending on whether therestriction is applied to a branch or to the provision of services. Ingeneral, less onerous measures should be applied to services business.Regrettably, the draft does little more than review the case law. Itdoes not comment on actual banking restrictions imposed by some memberstates.The commission's decision to consult on its draft communication is tobe welcomed. It should lead to a better text. Certainty is desired bythose credit institutions wishing to exercise their passport rights.Nevertheless, a number of difficulties do exist with the text as itstands. Interested parties have until the end of February 1996 to sendtheir comments on the draft to the commission.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Michael Fitz-James reportsIn the domestic legal services market, Canada's 45,000 practisinglawyers are facing tough times as a flat economy means fewer clients togo around. But on the international scene, things are getting brighterand brighter, as firms large and small share in a bonanza from agrowing global legal services market.Gordon Proudfoot, president of the Canadian Bar Association (CBA), is alawyer with the Boyne Clarke firm in Halifax, Nova Scotia and lamentsthe number of law students being "churned out by Canada's 22 lawschools".This has, he said, created a dramatic oversupply of legal labour andwhen students can't land jobs, they go into business as solepractitioners. There are now 9,000 of them - 20 percent of the lawyersin Canada - many working "out of their homes with a cellular phone anda laptop and low overheads", Proudfoot said.They effectively compete with small to medium-sized law firms and haveresulted in a net drop in legal fees across the country.The only way for firms to survive, according to Proudfoot, is tospecialise, and that's led to the "boutique" law firm - six or sevenlawyers who practise in a highly-specialised area, like intellectualproperty, taxation or labour law.Other medium-sized firms have been broken up by poor market conditions,with some members forming into boutiques and others being swallowed upby the big firms, which increasingly consolidate into larger entities.But there is growth in selling legal services beyond Canada's borders,and that's being driven both by the increasing globalisation of alleconomic activity and rapid technological change.Wynton Semple, a partner in the medium-sized Toronto firm Zammit Dashand Semple, has client relationships and business being developed injurisdictions as far away as Australia, and the firm keeps in touchthrough e-mail and other communications technology.The firm specialises in computer technology law and it increasinglyfinds clients' problems arise outside Canada, mostly in the US, wheremany opportunities exist because of the North American Free TradeAgreement.For the giant "national" firm McCarthy Tetrault, which has 560 lawyersin seven Canadian cities and in London, growth is unquestionably beingdriven by the firm's international work."If we were limiting our activities to the Canadian domestic market,there would clearly be a limit on our growth," said James McCartney,Q.C., a senior McCarthy partner."The phenomenon of globalisation is affecting other high Canadiancorporations. With the rapid development of technology and thereduction of trade barriers around the world, you can go anywhere andessentially provide your services - hook up with your base in Canada,produce documents and deal with specialists in the same way as ifthey're down the hall at the office," McCarthy said.For large firms, McCartney said, there are three "building blocks" forthe development of an international legal business strategy:* working with foreign investors who want to set up deals in Canada;* working with Canadian companies seeking deals abroad; and* foreign "project work" which doesn't involve Canada, but which relieson Canadian legal expertise.It's project work where McCarthy Tetrault and other Canadian firms seebig opportunities for growth, particularly when their specialisationpositions them to offer foreign clients a particular expertise.Canada's resource-based economy has contributed to McCarthy Tetrault'sextensive experience in the highly-regulated electrical energy, oil-gasand mining sectors. As well, Canada is a telecommunications leader, andthe firm also has considerable experience there as well.The firm has been able to market that expertise in a number of dealsaround the globe including the privatisation of a gold mine inKazakhstan and setting up a telecommunications regulatoryinfrastructure for the Indonesian Government."Internationally," said the CBA's Gordon Proudfoot, "Canadian lawyersare nicely positioned for international work, because of the politicsof our country and the reputation we have internationally. We are notas aggressive as the Americans are perceived to be, yet we do have allthose interesting nuances that come from the English law - plus Quebechas a civilian legal tradition. We're seeing Canadian lawyers doingvery well abroad - that's a real trend that will continue to grow. Theinternational Canadian lawyer has a very prosperous future ahead."While technological change may assist the globalisation phenomenon,others see a worrisome trend in its efficiencies actually reducing theneed for legal labour."The understanding of legal problems and the search for their solutionsis increasingly being viewed as a branch of software development,"pointed out Toronto's Wynton Semple."The client who used to pay $150 for a will can find a similar level ofservice provided for $29.95 on the shelves of the local software store.This `canned intelligence' presents a challenge to the practice of lawin Canada and lawyers are making a serious mistake if they believethese packages are only purchased by low-level consumers," Semplesaid.Indeed, McCartney said, in larger firms, much corporate finance workhas been replaced by a multiple-jurisdiction software which clientspurchase themselves and use to generate prospectuses and disclosuredocuments formerly prepared by lawyers.In other technology trends, firms large and small are leaping on theInternet bandwagon."The Internet phenomenon is amazing," Proudfoot said. "Canada is asparsely populated country and we love communications gizmos. Lawyersare falling in love with the Internet - the concerns about its securityare falling away rapidly."Governments both federal and provincial in Canada have finally decidedto reduce their staggering public debt load and that too is having amajor impact on the legal services marketplace.It's an opportunity for larger firms, McCartney said, as "debtreduction is driving a need to finance infrastructure in new ways - theprivate sector is increasingly involved in financing roads, sewers andwaterworks. We're even acting for the province of New Brunswick inbuilding a new provincial jail that will be operated by the privatesector."As well, in Canada's largest province, a newly-elected ConservativeGovernment is vowing to privatise many public undertakings - includingthe giant Ontario Hydro, North America's largest electrical utility.That will have a "major impact" on the legal services market, McCartneypredicted.But for smaller firms and sole practitioners, major cutbacks on legalaid are having a less-than-salutary impact on lawyers, who see theirincomes declining and a longer wait for their bills to be paid.Many are looking for other areas of practice said legal marketingconsultant Mary Ann Freedman of Toronto, who predicted a dramatic risein professional negligence suits, particularly since provincialgovernments are expected to allow American-style contingency fees,where a winning lawyer is paid from the lawsuit proceeds.Finally, there has been a significant rise in the number of in-housecorporate counsel in Canada, as companies seek to minimise the cost oflegal services. The number, according to Michael Crawford, editor ofCanadian Lawyer magazine is now around 5,000 and the trend of the late1980s for companies to"outsource" all legal work to law firms hasreversed itself.McCarthy Tterault's James McCartney said it is true the number of in-house lawyers is on the rise but these handle mostly routine corporatework which is fast disappearing from the larger firms' workload.Now the work outside firms get tends to be in more specialised areas -like taxation, labour and intellectual property.The large firms, he said, have the people and resources to develop thiskind of specialisation and offer it competitively to larger companies,which appear to be eager takers.LEADING CANADIAN LAW FIRMS: RANKED BY NUMBER OF LAWYERS                     Total      Total                     number of  number of   Number of                     lawyers(1) partners(2) partners                     as of      as of       as of                     September  September   September Total   Lever-Firm name            30 1995    30 1995     30 1995   staff   age(3)McCarthy Tetrault    565        325         327       1,503   0.7Blake Cassels & Graydon             322        155         164         867   1.1Gowling Strathy & Henderson           260(4)     n/a         904         n/a   n/aOsler Hoskin & Harcourt            257(5)     134         134         747   0.9Stikeman Elliott     249        124         124         770   1.0Fraser & Beatty      206         86          86         528   1.4Tory Tory DesLauriers & Binnington        202         91         106         620   1.2Fasken Campbell Godrey              200        115         120         350   0.7Goodman Phillips & Vineberg            200         82          80         457   1.4Borden & Elliot      194        115         155         566   0.7Lang Michener        185(4)     113(4)      113(4)      275(4)0.6(4)Smith Lyons Torrance Stevenson & Mayer   180(4)     n/a         804         450(4)n/aBennett Jones Verchere            179         92          92         454   0.9Ogilvy Renault       169        109         109         461   0.6Milner Fenerty       155        n/a          86         344   n/aLavery de Billy      144         85          85         222   0.7Desjardins Ducharme Stein Monast        125         63          77         312   1.0McMillan Binch       125         69          69         386   0.8Russell & DuMoulin   110        n/a          66         173   n/aDavis & Company      107         54          54         251   1.0Davies Ward & Beck   104        n/a          80         350   n/aLadner Downs         103         57          57         314   0.8Bull Housser & Tupper 96         62          62         262   0.5Lawson Lundell Lawson & McIntosh           76         45          45         200   0.7Byers Casgrain        68         31          31         175   1.2Lafleur Brown         60         35          43         147   0.7Hudon Gendron Harris Thomas               52         18          21         122   1.9Mackenzie Gervais     47         23          23         122   1.0Baker & McKenzie      42         18          18         101   1.3Meighen Demers        31         22          23          92   0.4(1) Includes partners and associates but excludes paralegals, patentagents, trainees and other(2) Equity partners participate in profits and losses at the firm(3) Number of lawyers less number of equity partners divided bynumber of equity partners(4) Estimated by LI(5) Figures for Jan 95n/a = not availableNOTE:  This list is not intended to be exhaustive.

(134 words) CopyrightLEGAL INFORMATION ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 1996WHAT'S IN THIS ISSUEI can't believe that this is the start of our 15th year! Little did I thinkthat U.S. Law Library Alert, as it was first design-ed, would evolve intothe LEGAL INFORMATION ALERT of today. When we started, law librarians hadonly the AALL newsletter, chapter newsletters, and us. Then Bob Berringstarted Legal Reference Services Quarterly, and others followed. Some arestill with us . . . and some have fallen along the wayside.We are glad to still be here. We love this business--there is alwayssomething new to learn! Do you realize how different legal publishing andlegal research are today from 15 years age? Throughout this coming year weplan to keep you informed about the coming publishing and researchchanges--and we expect lots of them!Bonnie Fox Schwartz, who writes for both this newsletter and its sisterpublication, BUSINESS INFORMATION ALERT, tells us all about EDGAR's currentcommercial variations. The choice is yours, but she helps guide you throughthe maze.We hope you read all the reviews in each issue. Sometimes there are onesworth noting here. Be sure to read Sex Discrimination in the LegalProfession. Then buy it for your managing partner/administrator/dean.Finally, a big thank you to our readers, reviewers, authors, publishers,and advertisers. We couldn't have done it without you! Happy New Year!--Donna Tuke HeroyEditor & PublisherBack to Headline List CopyrightLEGAL INFORMATION ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 1996EDGAR Update: The Proliferation of Commercial ProductsBy Bonnie Fox SchwartzOn October 1, 1995, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiledits home page, with access to the EDGAR database as its centerpiece. Thisevent occurred after the demise of the Town Hall EDGAR site and the offerby commercial vendors--notably Disclosure and Global SecuritiesInformation--to provide EDGAR access through their Internet home pages topublicize their value-added products. EDGAR users are now blessed withseveral Net sites, as well as a proliferation of related on-line and CD-ROMproducts from database producers and document delivery services.EDGAR, the acronym for Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval, symbolizesthe vast collection of corporate filings made directly and electronicallyto the SEC. With more than 15,000 public companies required by law toreport on such activities as quarterly and annual financials, stockownership changes, and securities offerings; the SEC, by the 1980s, wasliterally flooded with documents. Therefore, in a move toward a paperlessworld, an effort was launched to automate the process of filing, reviewing,and disseminating SEC information.Voluntary participants engaged in a pilot project in 1984; and after eightyears, the fully operational system was launched in 1992. By August 1995,when two additional groups were phased in, approximately 6,500 registrantswere EDGAR filers. All companies will be required to file electronically byMay 1996. Without EDGAR, the SEC would stagger under 10 million pages ayear.With the full functioning of EDGAR almost accomplished, debate now centerson how to make this electronic data accessible to the public. Even thoughall the information is supposed to be available without cost, the dataexists on the SEC database only in the form of gigabytes, raw numbers, andASCII text.The SEC initially chose Mead Data Central (now Lexis-Nexis since itsacquisition by Reed-Elsevier) to handle the dissemination of EDGARinformation to interested parties on a wholesale basis. (Mead also enjoyedthe contract to develop the initial EDGAR database.) Under this agreement,the SEC would receive only microfiche copies of the filings, with Meadretaining the electronic records and providing terminals for the public inSEC reading rooms in Washington, New York, Chicago, and other regionaloffices.While Mead constructed the "back end" of this system, Compu-Serve won thecommunications contract, which includes the receipt and notification ofEDGAR filings to companies. With EDGAR Link, registrants can file onlinethrough CompuServe's network or via a direct connection to the SEC.The EDGAR database has proven a daily necessity to a variety ofprofessionals, including attorneys, investment analysts, managementconsultants, accountants, librarians, and information brokers. Since eachof these groups has specific needs, retailers of SEC filings compete toprovide products that access and search EDGAR filings easily andefficiently. Each commercial vendor repackages and formats the electronicdata, in the process adding different software interfaces and searchengines to ease the retrieval process and make the information usable. Inaddition, these competitors offer other products, integrated with EDGARdata, to enhance the information and its presentation.In the past, EDGAR "updates" consisted of endless recitals of statisticalcharts detailing how many companies were electronic filers, how manyrecords were in the database, and phasing in schedules with futureprojections. Now that three out of four companies file electronically, withall expected to be computerized this year, an appropriate EDGAR update isan overview of commercial EDGAR products as well as EDGAR on the Internet.In addition, while law librarians, paralegals, and attorneys who use EDGARdata share many priorities with accountants, investment analysts, and otherprofessionals, information needs peculiar to the legal environment will bethe focus here in evaluating EDGAR products.Everyone insists on timeliness and accuracy: How quickly are the filingsposted? Are the companies listed correctly and in a standardized format?Are tender offers and other ownership-related filings listed by target orbidder/owner? Beyond these basics, users must always remember that theEDGAR universe is not the complete world of SEC filings. Foreign issuers,sovereigns, initial public offerings, and certain forms (like 20Fs,Schedule Bs, 6Ks, ADVs, TAs) are not yet electronically filed. Likewise,EDGAR documents cannot always include graphs and other visual materials.Historical filings also are not on EDGAR. When a complete list of documentsis required, such limitations must be considered.Searching capabilities are also crucial, whether the question involves aparticular corporation or precedent research. How easily can a company'sstock purchase agreements be located or can examples of specific types ofcontracts with particular language be easily found? Can sections and pagesbe quickly located, saved to disk, and printed out in customized reports?This review will address such issues.====================Moody's Company DataMoody's Investors Service, owned by Dun & Brad-street, offers EDGAR inconjunction with its Company Data database. This product combines detailed,descriptive information on companies (from the Manuals) with SEC filings onEDGAR. One can search Moody's Company Data for more than 10,000 publiccorporations and simultaneously access EDGAR filings on CD-ROMs. Moody'sEDGAR discs contain the full ASCII text of all mandated filings sinceAugust 1993. Multi-font, multi-column printouts can be customized, and thedata can be directly downloaded to spreadsheet programs.Features that enhance the accessibility of Moody's EDGAR files include:searching by word or phrase with an EDGAR document; reviewing the index bycompany name, filing, or file date; section and exhibit jumping; cuttingand pasting; and integrating document printouts with the Company Datadatabase. Moody's proprietary MoodEASE software allows searching by 160variables including word, phrase, and financials. The program also enablessorting by variables as well as peer group analysis. Printing optionsreduce the number of pages as well as save on cost, volume, and time, withan optional dual-column compressed print function.Moody's also is filling the gaps both for pre-EDGAR historical filings andfor the most recent documents electronically filed after the last CD-ROMwas pressed. For old paper documents, Moody's promises to add the WorkloadIndex, a compendium of all filings with a computerized-link order form forhard copies (those not available electronically) from Docutronics, Moody'srecently purchased subsidiary specializing in document delivery. For thelatest EDGAR filings, Moody's offers EDGAR Edge, a real-time dedicatedserver with unlimited access, monitors for watches, word search capabilityacross all EDGAR documents, and additional indexes and tags.Moody's presents a handsome, comprehensive package, especially for thosewho have not previously invested in a large CD-ROM collection. Its CompanyData database, combined with EDGAR filings, covers a broad range ofbusiness and financial information needs; and Moody's also offers otherdiscs on foreign companies--an attractive supplement. When anticipatedproducts are in place and all SEC filings are EDGARized, Moody's will be aformidable competitor in the EDGAR arena.===========================Global Securities' LIVEDGARLIVEDGAR, produced by GSI Online, a division of Global SecuritiesInformation, Inc., provides real-time, dial-up access to EDGAR filings,with documents available as soon as they are filed. Although GSI Onlineconnects to the database via a dedicated line, its on-demand dial-upservice is a cost-effective means of obtaining EDGAR filings from anypersonal computer with a modem.LIVEDGAR is a Windows-based, menu-driven system, that enables searching offilings in the entire EDGAR universe, since April 10, 1993. LIVEDGAR isalso the only commercial source at present to research the text of unusualfilings like S6s (unit investment trusts), mutual fund documents on N2 orN1A, and other unfamiliar forms.One can access the database by company name, SEC file number, or byexample. After a company name or file number is entered, a list ofdocuments appears. Once a particular document is selected, the user has theoption to search for a word or string of terms within the document. Thesplit screen--a convenient search feature--provides the filings list alongwith a glimpse of the full-text with the term(s) highlighted.Searching by example offers a choice of fields, including form, dateranges, state of incorporation, stock exchange, SIC code, and free-textterms. This capability over the entire EDGAR database makes LIVEDGAR anexcellent resource for precedents. When the search is completed, a list ofdocuments is generated, again with a split screen that gives a partial viewof the full-text with the search term(s) highlighted.LIVEDGAR's printing capabilities have pluses and minuses. Exhibits arealways separated for easy access and printing of specific items. But if anentire document is desired, a worksheet must be called up on a separatemenu, and a cover page is generated for each exhibit.While LIVEDGAR is cost-effective, easy to use, and opens doors to filingsheretofore unsearchable, Global Securities does not fill the non-EDGAR gapswith additional products. They must be supplemented by a competitor'sofferings for the complete documents picture.==========================================================Disclosure's Access Disclosure, Laser D II, and EDGAR PLUSDisclosure Inc.--historically a supplier of SEC paper filings on microficheand CD-ROM--has now integrated EDGAR into its product offerings, withAccess Disclosure, EDGAR PLUS, and Laser D II.Access Disclosure (formerly known as Electronic Company Filing Index orECFI) lists all documents available via Disclosure. While its major purposeis to facilitate ordering, Access Disclosure also can serve as a researchtool because it integrates the EDGAR filings with the paper documents aswell as a range of non-SEC materials (like stock exchange listingapplications, annual reports of foreign companies, Euro prospectuses, andCanadian filings) all into a single list by company, which dates back to1968. EDGAR filings are clearly noted and can be viewed and printed fromthe same computer terminal. Documents are not textually searchable onAccess Disclosure, however, although sections and exhibits are broken outfor selective printing. The first page of EDGAR documents is supposed to beavailable for viewing free of charge, as a check for accuracy, but thisscreen is frequently blank.For specific document and precedent research Disclosure has introducedEDGAR PLUS for word searching EDGAR filings. This CD-ROM product is updatedmonthly. EDGAR PLUS is a full-text, value-added database of EDGAR filingsthat includes extracts of non-electronic SEC documents. The composite ofinformation allows menu searching on Disclosure's 300 fields and formattags, keyword searching, and displays of specific categories without wadingthrough entire documents. EDGAR PLUS features also are integrated intoDisclosure's Laser D II, which supports its formatting and navigationaltags for electronic filings on its laser discs.Because of Disclosure's long prominence in SEC document delivery,subscribers are familiar with its products and coverage and can adapteasily to the new EDGAR product offerings. No other service, at present,can match the retrospective coverage in the filing index, combined withforeign company and sovereign filings, as well as non-SEC documents. Thosefamiliar with Compact D SEC and Compact D New Issues, will have no problemusing EDGAR PLUS, but may hesitate to rely on yet another disc, whenalternative online competitive products are available.===============================EDGAR PLUS on Lexis and WestlawBoth the Lexis and Westlaw databases have contracts with Disclosure tooffer EDGAR PLUS. Since law firms subscribe to these providers and legalinformation searchers are familiar with these systems, this convenientaccess to electronic SEC filings provides a comfortable alternative.However, users need to be aware of the currency of the filings as well asthe extent of the coverage. At present, periodic EDGAR filings (10Ks,proxies, 8Ks) are searchable full-text, but the Williams Act filings(tender offers) will be phased in.Again, searchers must realize that not all companies are EDGAR filers, andcertain registration statements (like initial public offerings) are not yetfiled electronically. In the EDGAR PLUS files, all exhibits included withthe document are available online separately. Those documents filed priorto September 1994, however, include only selected exhibits. While theseproducts have the advantage of familiar search commands, they do not coverthe complete EDGAR picture.=============================Federal Filings' EDGAR DirectProduced by Federal Filings, Inc., a Dow Jones company, EDGAR Directprovides real-time online access to SEC electronic filings the instant theyare available. EDGAR Direct is received through a dedicated line, asopposed to a dial-up service. Windows-based software uses the "find"command to search for particular documents and cut-and-clip sections;converts to word processing or spreadsheet programs; downloads directly toa network or e-mailbox; and manipulates fonts and text sizes. Searching canbe done by company name and file form, with the ability to create profilesto filter out desired documents. Generated lists of filings can be groupedby all, mergers and deals, high yield, or convertibles; and they can beviewed simultaneously with specific filings sorted into appropriatewindows.EDGAR Direct promises additional search capabilities in the future, such asby ticker symbol, SIC code, and other fields. Most customers run the systemall day long so users are aware as soon as documents are filed. Such real-time access is especially useful for investment analysts who need EDGARinformation instantaneously.=====================EDGAR on the InternetThe availability of the EDGAR database on the Internet marks the finalrealization of Progressive Era and New Deal securities legislationsponsors, who envisioned that public disclosure of company informationwould enable investors to make prudent decisions. When the SEC awarded Meadthe contract to develop EDGAR and disseminate the data on a wholesalebasis, public-interest groups demanded free access to this information.Jamie Love, of Ralph Nader's Taxpayer Assets Project (TAP), who has lobbiedfor years to make publicly funded government data available, considers theSEC EDGAR database one of the "crown jewels."Ed. note: For background information, see the January 1995 issue of LEGALINFORMATION ALERT, a special guide featuring "Assault on the Citadel:Romancing the Crown Jewels of West Publishing."At the same time, Carl Malamud, who formed the Internet MulticastingService (IMS), in October 1993 teamed up with New York University on a two-year National Science Foundation grant, to make EDGAR available on theInternet. With additional support from corporations like Sun Microsystems,HarperCollins, Persoft, and UUNET Technologies, the project was supervisedby NYU's Stern School of Business, while the database management wassubcontracted to IMS, who made EDGAR available on its Town Hall Internetsite (http://www.town.hall.org).The Town Hall project provided a variety of mechanisms to access the EDGARdatabase, from low-end and e-mail interfaces to high-end Mosaicconnections. This Internet EDGAR Dissemination Project allowed users toobtain electronic filings made since 1994 on a "day-delayed" basis. Searchcapabilities as well as printing options were not as sophisticated ascommercial products, but for the individual user or small informationcenter, the cost only amounted to basic Internet provisions.With the end of the grant and the Town Hall project on October 1st, the SECinaugurated its home page on the Internet (http://www.sec.gov) with accessto the EDGAR database. Since this server is "under construction" at thetime of this writing and is expected to undergo changes over the next fewmonths, I will describe the menus offered.The SEC Internet site enables retrieval of 1994 and 1995 electronic filingsavailable to the public. The service has two types of access: via Webbrowsers or via anonymous file transfer protocol (ftp). You can log on asuser "anonymous" with a password consisting of your electronic mailaddress. Searchers can use OR, AND, and ADJ, when entering terms, andresults are generated in a list of filings posted by form and in reversechronological order. Other retrieval tools include a quick forms lookup,current events analysis, mutual funds retrieval/prospectus search, Schedule13D ownership report, and executive compensation test extracted from proxy(DEF 14A) filings. The prospectus report, for example, gives all "485"filings pertaining to mutual funds of choice.While the SEC Internet site appears to offer an equivalent replacement forTown Hall (including a trade off between limited search capabilities andlow cost) two commercial vendors also offer access to EDGAR through theirhome pages. Disclosure entered into an agreement with New York Universityto continue providing full access to EDGAR by allowing NYU to maintain itsWeb site without interruption. NYU can be accessed directly(http://EDGAR.stern .nyu.edu) or through a link from Disclosure's home page(http://www.disclosure.com). Its search menus seem almost identical to theSEC's home page EDGAR site. At the same time, Global Securities offers freereal-time access to LIVEDGAR via its home page (http://www.gsionline.com),although this service is a scaled-down version of the commercial productand must be downloaded to a disk and added to the program manager through a"special client program".With EDGAR a reality, SEC information specialists must determine the bestmeans to access the database, search it, and present the data. Prioritieslike currency, coverage, search capabilities, and value-added featuresshould be considered when choosing EDGAR products to meet your specificinformation needs.--Bonnie Fox Schwartz is a reference librarian in New York City.Back to Headline List CopyrightLEGAL INFORMATION ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Items on Legal Tech, IAC, Matthew Bender & Folio, Lawyers Coop & Shepard'sPersonnel, CCH Sold, Thomson Acquisitions, RIA Group, Legal InfoManagement, Marquis Who's Who Lawsuit, Where to Get SEC Documents, AND MOREBy Donna Tuke Heroy==========Legal TechIn November of 1995, I attended the Legal Tech show, which is sponsored byPrice Waterhouse. Held three times a year, it is clearly a marketingvehicle for Price Waterhouse's legal technology consulting department.Legal Tech differs from other technology-related shows in that it targetslarge law firms as its primary market.There were more research-oriented presentations than at previous PriceWaterhouse Legal Tech shows, and the sessions I attended were uneven inquality. Sabrini I. Pacifici from Sidley & Austin's Washington, D.C. officegave an excellent presentation on the use of technology in law libraries.In "New Legal Research Tools," Professor J.C. Smith, a Canadian legaltheorist, attempted to explain FlexLaw, a product whose object is toautomate the management of legal information based on linguisticconnections between words. I'm at a loss to explain what this system addsto the online landscape.Another presentation by a partner at Baker & McKenzie, titled "GoingOnline: Electronic Research by Trial Lawyers," was a thinly veiled overviewof what's new on Lexis.More electronic legal research products were exhibited than at previousshows. Lexis-Nexis is focusing on its Office product (which we will bereviewing) in many of its trade show appearances. West Publishing Companydemonstrated its West Legal Network, which is still in beta testing andalso will be reviewed in LEGAL INFORMATION ALERT.The Microsoft Network (MSN), a new commercial online service available as afee-based option to Windows 95 users, introduced its new Law Officeproduct. In the coming months MSN will be looking for partners to helpbuild its online venture. One of the first services to be offered isPlatinum Pages, a global collection of online directories of attorneys,legal experts, and vendors.The exhibits at this show are always worthwhile, but given the lack ofquality I witnessed in many of the presentations, I cannot recommend payingthe high fee to attend the seminar portion. Pre-registrants may view theexhibits for free; otherwise, there is a fee ($20) at the door. Forinformation about future Legal Tech dates, contact PW CorporatePresentations, 212-877-5619.==========IAC UpdateMany readers have asked when our newsletters will be available onInformation Access Company's Newsletter Database. As you may know, theALERT signed the agreement to do so over a year ago. One issue of BUSINESSINFORMATION ALERT was formatted and sent electronically. However, it wasnot completely loaded by IAC onto its database, nor was it loaded in amanner acceptable to the ALERT.I felt that this was unethical. We have asked IAC representatives to reloadthat issue in its entirety and as originally formatted. As soon as we areable to independently confirm that our newsletter is electronicallyrepresented on Information Access' Newsletter Database as we originallyintended it to be, we will commence formatting and sending future ALERTnewsletters.In the meantime, both LEGAL INFORMATION and BUSINESS INFORMATION ALERT arestill available on NewsNet and can be retrieved for an extremely fairprice: $5 for an article (usually an entire article or review) and $20 forthe whole issue. The ALERT is seriously looking for additional onlineoutlets for our publications. If you have suggestions about where you wouldlike to see our publications, please let us know.================================Matthew Bender Converts to FolioAbandoning its proprietary CD-ROM search-and-retrieval software, MatthewBender is converting its CD-ROM Practice Libraries to Folio, the industrystandard. By the time you read this 18 Practice Libraries should beconverted. This was one of the first things that MB's new CEO, KatherineDowning, ordered when she joined the company in September 1995.For more information on Matthew Bender products call 800-223-1940. For moreinformation on Folio, see our September 1995 article, "Folio Corporation IsImproving Your Future," written by Kevin Miles of Haynes & Boone.=================Personnel ChangesErik J. Heels has joined American Lawyer Media as Director of InternetProduct Development. He came from Lawyers Cooperative where he served asInternet Systems architect. Heels is well known for The Legal List,published for several years on the Internet and, most recently, in printformat as The Legal List, Internet Desk Reference, Law-Related Resources onthe Internet and Elsewhere from Lawyers Cooperative.Gary Spivey has been promoted to Vice-President, Electronic ProductDevelopment at Shepard's/McGraw-Hill. He was previously in charge ofcitations development.============Merger ManiaCCH has been acquired by Wolters Kluwer for the sum of $1.9 billion. Thiswas a surprise to many law librarians. We hope that the incredibly highprice paid in the merger will not result in higher prices for CCH products.Thomson Corporation is on a buying spree. Thomson Legal Publishing (TLP)has acquired the topical products and other non-citation legal informationproducts from Shepard's/McGraw Hill. This includes some 270 print titles,23 desktop codes, and 30 software products.Librarians will be hearing from Thomson in a letter introducing the newpublisher. However, during the first quarter of 1996, servicing will bedone by a Shepard's transition team. Products will be divided as follows:specialty titles to Clark Boardman Callaghan, state-specific titles toLawyers Cooperative Publishing or Bancroft-Whitney, and tax titles to a newRIA Group (see below). Interestingly, Brian Hall, current president ofThomson Legal Publishing used to be with Shepard's/McGraw Hill.Thomson, through its Bancroft-Whitney division, has acquired LegalSolutions Inc., a publisher of California-specific computer generated legalforms. Recently Thomson also agreed to work with the Association of TrialLawyers of America to develop legal research products for trial lawyers.These products will include national and state-specific print andelectronic products.=======================Thomson Forms Tax GroupThomson Corporation has formed the Research Institute of America Group (RIAGroup), which is comprised of the former Research Institute of America,Practitioners Publishing Company, and Warren Gorham & Lamont. Euan Menzieswho has been president of RIA for the past two years was appointedpresident and CEO of this new group, which will focus on the tax andaccounting information markets. RIA Group parallels Thomson LegalPublishing, and both groups report to the Thomson Financial andProfessional Publishing Group.Visit RIAWeb at http://www.riatax.com for weekly tax news.==================================Legal Info Management Reports SoldLegal Information Management Reports has been sold to Library Specialists,Inc., of Marietta, Ga., which will continue the title starting with Volume8, 1996.

Don't worry. A federal court for the Second Circuit Courtof Appeals in New York has affirmed an award of money damages of more than$1.6 million to the real McCoy, Marquis Who's Who. Ironically, Who's WhoWorldwide Registry, from Lake Success, N.Y., has declared bankruptcy.===================Need SEC Documents?After you've read this month's lead article on the variety of EDGARproducts springing up, note this additional source for SEC products: FDRInfoCenters. In the past, researchers had to go to Disclosure, FDR's parentcompany. The change was made to convenience FDR customers.Look for other new products from FDR, including a biweekly fax newsletter(free to clients) called FDR Facts.

Theproblem arises when actually trying to locate relevant material when youneed it. For example, if it takes you an hour to find something "for free"on the Internet, but it was available for a minimal price on one of theindexed commercial providers, it was not a bargain.If you know exactly where something is located on the Internet and havedownloaded or printed such material from that site previously, it may beworth your while to explore the Internet option before turning tocommercial providers. If it is unfamiliar information you need, now isprobably not the time to go exploring new territory--especially if you'rebilling your time to the client. Later, after the information has beenpassed along to the appropriate party, try looking on the Internet for it.If you find it, you will know in the future where it is located. Also, whenyou have questions about the source or doubts about accuracy, commercialproviders are always your best bet.===============Stay Up to DateTo find out what your users are most interested in, glance over magazinessuch as ABA Journal, National Law Journal, or local bar associationjournals. Since few of us have time to read these periodicals cover-to-cover, nor do we want to, just scan them to see what topics are importantto your users. This can help alert you to upcoming trends and prepare youfor related questions. It also may help you when a patron asks, "I rememberreading something somewhere about . . ."=======================Keep Two Sets in MotionCan't afford two completely up-to-date sets of a looseleaf treatise? If youhave two sets but stagger under the cost of keeping a second "convenience"set current, try keeping the superseded pages of one set to interfile inthe older set. The older set then will be only one release behind incurrency, but may still be relied upon for quick reference. Caveat: Markthe convenience copy prominently, and remind users of the importance ofchecking the current set before relying on the information.======================Watch for Time WastersOne of the biggest obstacles to working efficiently can be those subtletime wasters. Here are some time wasters and ways to deal with them:1) Being placed on hold. Use the speakerphone while you are on hold so thatyou can work on other projects. Once the person on the other end picks upthe receiver, though, you should do the same. Most people feel that usingthe speakerphone during one-on-one conversations is pretentious.2) Friendly interruptions. It is difficult at times to find the properbalance between being friendly and getting your work done, especially forreference librarians who want to be available and approachable for work-related inquiries, but not distracted or interrupted for chatting. If youare working at your desk, try standing up when it becomes obvious that thepatron does not have a real question but just wants to talk. This oftensignals to the individual that the conversation is drawing to a close. Ifyou are already standing, pick up a file or a book, or even the telephonereceiver. If none of these work, try simply saying, "Well, I guess I shouldget back to work."3) Meetings. Most meetings suffer from a lack of focus, thereby lastinglonger than they need to. Begin with an agenda. Gently bring people back tothe agenda when the conversation begins to wander. Set a clearly definedtime limit and stick to it. Such restrictions can help keep the focus onthe business at hand.===========Recycle CDsIf you feel guilty throwing away those superseded CDs, now you have anoption.

Finkin. 1995. BNA Books.Hardcover. 477p. ISBN: 0-87179-883-2. $110.Rapid advances in technology have made electronic eavesdropping apossibility for an ever-increasing number of companies. Global competitionhas only intensified long-standing employer interest in hiring the bestpossible employees, monitoring their productivity, and ensuring that costsare kept as low as possible (especially healthcare costs). Thesedevelopments have wrought conflict over privacy in the workplace.For an emerging area of law governed by a tangle of state and federalstatutes, regulations, nonbinding administrative guidance, constitutionalprovisions, and common law principles, a fully developed treatise would bea welcome addition to any labor and employment lawyer's bookshelf.Unfortunately, this is not the objective of Finkin's Privacy in EmploymentLaw, nor may it be a realistic ambition given the immaturity of this areaof law. The goal of his work is to offer a set of guideposts through themaze of privacy rights in the workplace.Privacy in Employment Law is a three-part work consisting of a primer,state statutes, and sample business forms. The intended scope of the primeris ambitious given its brevity. It covers medical, genetic, drug, alcohol,tobacco and psychological screening; disclosure and access to records;background and credit checks; monitoring employee performance throughsurveillance, electronic interception, and eavesdropping; and employercontrol of employee political, religious, and sexual conduct andexpression. Finkin does not seek to develop legal theories for testing thelaw in the private employment sector. Nevertheless, because it is such anunsettled area of the law, an author cannot help but indulge in speculationon the shape of the law yet to be written.Part 2 reprints state statutes on polygraph and lie detection, drugtesting, use of tobacco and alcohol, and access to personnel records fromBNA's Individual Employee Rights Manual. Part 3 comprises sample businessforms reprinted from BNA's Policy and Practice Series.For individual attorneys and small firms with very limited labor andemployment practices, Finkin's Privacy in Employment Law will serve as ahandy and convenient finding tool. However, in these times of tightbudgets, it is not a best buy for libraries that support significantemployment practices and already subscribe to BNA's Policy and Practiceseries and Labor Relations Reporter. The cost of this one-volume work iscompetitive with the companion volumes published by Wiley, which consistsof Decker's Employee Privacy Law and Practice and Employee Privacy: Formsand Procedure, but it also is largely duplicative.--Linda Hauck, Schnader HarrisonSegal & Lewis, PhiladelphiaBack to Headline List CopyrightLEGAL INFORMATION ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 1996EMPLOYMENT LAW --Sex Discrimination in the Legal ProfessionBernard F. Lentz & David N. Laband. 1995. Quorum Books.Hardcover. 256p. ISBN: 0-89930-928-3. $49.95.Using the 1984 and 1990 National Surveys of Career Satisfaction/Dissatis-faction administered by the Young Lawyers Division of the ABA, economistsBernard Lentz and David Laband explore the complex dynamics of sexualdiscrimination as experienced by women lawyers. This book is the result oftheir effort to reconcile their 1991 study--which showed no significantdifferences in salary and promotion between women lawyers and their malecounterparts--with those of two other earlier studies that came to contraryconclusions.The authors conclude that the earlier raw numbers showed an income gapbetween male and female lawyers that can be explained by reasons other thandiscrimination: primarily by the fact that women entered the profession inlarge numbers relatively recently and were, therefore, less experienced andless likely to be partners than men as a group. Because the experience gaphad narrowed by 1990, when Lentz and Laband undertook their study, thatfactor had become statistically insignificant.This book is an extended quantitative analysis of the data produced by theABA surveys; therefore, it may be heavy-going for attorneys without theappropriate background. If nothing else, the book explores the complexnature of sexual discrimination and demonstrates how little of the picturecan be seen through the simplest, usually evaluated, indicators, namelyearnings and promotions. Although there seems to be no significantdifferences between the two groups based on these measures, the ABA surveysshowed a significant difference in the perceptions of the female attorneys.How can we explain the discrepancy between the hard numbers and theperceptions of the individuals within the profession? The authors postulatethat because attorneys are familiar with the law on sex discrimination,they now make sure that there is no disparity on these measures. However,the authors could not discount the convictions of the women surveyed thatsuch discrimination is still prevalent. This caused them to move beyond thedata in the surveys and discuss the multitude of ways that sexdiscrimination can occur--whether by superiors, coworkers, clients, judges,or juries.Covert discrimination breeds intimidation and lack of trust, which causeswomen to alter their behavior and thereby give employers the justificationthey need to discriminate on performance grounds. The higher percentage ofwomen in the corporate, public sector, or small firm settings may be theresult of women choosing these settings due to the discrimination theyexperience in other areas. Or, a client may complain to a woman'ssupervisor that she didn't perform adequately when, in reality, the clientsimply dislikes working with women.Similarly, a jury may not reach a verdict for a woman's client due tosexual bias on the part of some jury members. That adverse result mayconsequently affect her standing in the firm, because that underlying biasis not apparent to those judging her performance. It is because this third-party bias is not always apparent to employers that the authors concludethat the Title VII imposition of liability on employers for third-partybias is probably inefficient.Ironically, the authors ultimately conclude that the data's "objectivefactors," such as earnings and promotion, don't tell the real story.Therefore, they use the survey figures on individuals' perceptions ofdiscrimination to conclude that these feelings of discrimination cannot bedismissed. For this reason, it may be unconvincing to those searching forhard evidence. However, Sex Discrimination in the Legal Profession isinvaluable in showing the gap between individuals' perceptions of men andwomen lawyers, and in developing arguments of how the complex dynamics ofsex discrimination may belie the figures.--Charlotte L.

Clark Boardman Callaghan.CD-ROM service, monthly & ELR Update supplements, 36 per year. $2,295.The Environmental Law Reporter, already one of the finest environmentalreporters on the market in its looseleaf format, will probably become oneof the finest environmental reporters in CD-ROM format. I say "probably"because with each release, Clark Boardman Callaghan (CBC) improves theproduct, even though they are three to four weeks late each month. Wesubscribe to both the print and CD-ROM, and our preference is moving towardthe CD-ROM for its ease of use and accessibility on the Wide Area Network.Using the popular Folio software, this product makes research easy toaccomplish. Printing documents, however, is another matter. Rather thaninputting each document as a record, CBC has made each sentence a record,which necessitates blocking the text to be printed. CBC developers need tocorrect this and I am sure they will. It also would help if documents couldbe printed as they appear in the print product: in dual-column format.Product features include providing access through 10 formal informationcategories. The categories, which follow the printed materials closely,include Administrative Materials, Cases, Code of Federal Regulations, Newsand Analysis, Statutes, State Regulations, Federal Register, LitigationDocuments, International Treaties, and Index. Each category may be openedand searched, and there are plenty of jump-links to other documents.How mature is this product? Well, each release is a tighter, better-linkedproduct than the previous one. If one Folio CD-ROM product could be held asa standard for its ease of use and maturity, in my opinion it would beLawyers Cooperative's United States Code Service. ELR: The EnvironmentalLaw Reporter is not far behind.I recommend this product for high-volume researchers trying to reduceonline costs. It also would be ideal for organizations moving into theelectronic library concept.--Kevin Miles, Manager of Library Services,Haynes & Boone, DallasBack to Headline List CopyrightLEGAL INFORMATION ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 1996HEALTH LAW --When Life Ends: Legal Overviews, Medicolegal Forms, and Hospital PoliciesArthur S. Berger. 1995. Praeger Publishers.Hardcover. 208p. ISBN: 0-275-94620-7. $59.95.The Patient Self-Determination Act was enacted in 1990 to promote citizenawareness of and participation in advance directives for health care.Although its aim was to encourage individuals and families to thoughtfullydiscuss and make healthcare decisions in advance; for most patients, theintroduction to options regarding treatment and advance directives comesupon admission to a healthcare facility. At that time, patients are oftentoo sick, confused, or panicky to make thoughtful decisions; and familymembers face, in addition to fear and stress, a bewildering paper blizzard.One hospital study showed that less that one percent of the patientssurveyed later understood or were aware of the materials on advancedirectives that they had received upon admission.Obviously, better methods of communications are needed. Medical personnel,healthcare administrators, social workers, and attorneys should all be morefamiliar with advance directives in order to inform individuals of theirrights. These professionals also should encourage their clients to preparefor these situations and work to ensure that the healthcare institutionswith the appropriate policies in place are prepared to honor the advancedirectives of their patients.In the first part of the book, author Berger discusses in plain languagesix areas of concern: refusal of life-sustaining treatment, advancedirectives, surrogate decision making, withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, DNR orders, and PSDA. Berger clearly and succinctlyanalyzes the legal, ethical, and medical questions involved--alwaysemphasizing the individual's rights. He ties in the landmark legal cases,and points out the essential elements of institutional policies andmedicolegal forms for each topic.In the second half, sample policies and forms--including optional clausesfor pregnant or minor patients and other exceptional situations--arenumerically keyed to the text. Berger suggests that using such forms andpolicies--first, to ensure that patients' wishes are expressed and honored,and second, to protect the medical personnel and institutions fromliability--also will promote patient-centered health care. A detailedindex, a table of cases, a bibliography, and a list of legal citationsprovide access to both the contents and to other related materials.Specific state statutes are not included.Although written primarily for physicians and hospital administrators, WhenLife Ends is certainly appropriate, and perhaps even essential reading forattorneys (and their clients) working in health fields, estate planning,and elder law, as well as for social workers, clergy, and private citizens.End-of-life decisions will surely touch many of us either as caregivers,relatives, or patients. When Life Ends provides an objective framework forthis often difficult, emotional subject. It is unreservedly recommended forlaw libraries, medical libraries, and social services collections inuniversities.--Kelly Browne, Reference Librarian,University of Tennessee Law Library, KnoxvilleBack to Headline List CopyrightLEGAL INFORMATION ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 1996INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY --BNA's Intellectual Property Library on CD-ROM1995. The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.CD-ROM. 2 discs. $1,750. Monthly updates.BNA's Intellectual Property Library on CD-ROM contains the full-text ofBNA's U.S. Patents Quarterly (USPQ), 1st and 2nd Series, which comprisesall intellectual property decisions of the federal and state courts andadministrative agencies, as well as U.S. Court of Appeals for the FederalCircuit decisions.The archival disc covers volumes 68 to 231 of the USPQ, 1st Series (1946 to1986 cases). The subscription disc, which is updated monthly, covers theSecond Series of USPQ and the Federal Circuit cases. Each disc alsocontains Finding Aids, Topical Index, Classification Outline, ConversionTable, and Parallel Citations.This is a Folio Views product that runs in the Windows environment. Thereare hypertext links, easy-to-use pull-down menus, and the capacity tomanipulate and customize text, store the executed searches, download, andprint. BNA provides numerous helpful resources to facilitate use of thisCD-ROM. There is a "Quick Start Guide," a "Quick Reference Card," and acomplete looseleaf user guide. The user guide is updated each month byonline and print versions of CD News, which includes "User Hints" and "Listof New Cases." Online help, an online tutorial, and a 22-minute video,"Getting the Most Out of BNA's Intellectual Property Library on CD-ROM,"round out a useful introduction to the product's features. BNA alsoprovides excellent telephone support and search assistance.There are three customized query templates for conducting searches.Template 1 searches by "Words of Phrases," template 2 by "Any FieldCombination," and template 3 by "Case Citation." Any Field Combination ismost useful because it allows searching by all of the following: attorneyname, case name, citation number, cited cases, classification number,decision date, docket number, headnotes, judge, jurisdiction, particularpatents (by patent number or description), and words in the text of thecase. Intellectual Property Library also has the ability to expand or limityour searches, for example, to include or exclude unpublished cases.The Words or Phrases template is quite limited because the search logicused in proximity searching is so unconventional. For example, to search"trademark within 3 words of infringement," you enter "trademarkinfringement"@3. Complex queries are very difficult because truncated termscannot be used within the proximity search.It would be helpful if BNA added a time-tracker for accurate time-keeping;as well as an opening-screen notice indicating the disc date and the latestUSPQ included therein. This information is provided in the print and onlineversions of CD News.Except for the phrase-searching limitations mentioned above, BNA'sIntellectual Property Library on CD-ROM is a very useful product.

Floyd. 1995. William S. Hein & Co.Hardcover. 95p. ISBN: 0-89941-906-2. $37.This volume, the "culmination" of a student research project, is one ofmany research guides published by Hein. According to the author, itattempts to provide novice patent attorneys with methods and tips forresearching patent litigation. However, the guide is so well written, italso is suitable for law students and the general public. New attorneyswill find the guide helpful, and those with experience in the area may wantto consult it as a refresher.It is divided into three main sections: best, secondary, and primarysources. The author also includes a people sources section, withinformation on locating attorneys, judges, and associations that haveknowledge of mechanical patent law and litigation. This volume has a tableof contents (but no index), a table of abbreviations, and charts of patentand patent-related databases on Westlaw and Lexis. The subsection onlocating books includes a brief discussion of Internet searching.The research guide provides only cursory coverage of computer patent andbio-technical litigation, pre-constitutional sources of patent protection,and patent statutes before the Patent Act of 1952. Additionally, patentprosecution sources and transactional aspects of patents are not included.This research guide to mechanical patent litigation is appropriate for lawfirms specializing in patent litigation, law school libraries, anddepository libraries that house patent information.--Deanne Morgan, Legal Research Services,Bloomington, Ill.Back to Headline List CopyrightLEGAL INFORMATION ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 1996INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY --Software and Intellectual Property Protection:Copyright and Patent Issues for Computer and Legal ProfessionalsBernard A. Galler. 1995. Quorum Books.Hardcover. 224p. ISBN: 0-89930-974-7. $55.Author Bernard A. Galler is not an attorney, but an expert witness oncomputers who has participated extensively in some of the most influentialtrials involving software disputes. In this book, Galler aims to informreaders about copyright and patent issues that affect computer and legalprofessionals.Almost everyone uses computers in their homes or in their workplaces tosome extent, so almost everyone uses software and hardware. Having becomesuch an integral part of life in the 1990s, computers seem to have beenaround much longer, but in fact have only come of age in the last 45 years.Therefore, the body of law that developed to protect intellectual propertyearlier in the century is inadequate to address the legal issues of today'scomputer age. With the rise in importance of computers there likewise comesa pressing need for laws that govern the intellectual property rights ofcomputer hardware and software inventors.Galler has made every effort to make the current state of computer softwareand intellectual property laws accessible to his varied intended audienceof business executives, legal professionals, and the general public. Forreaders with little computer background, Galler has included an extensiveappendix, which details the basic fundamentals of computer technology.The book begins with an overview of the laws governing computerintellectual property, and the remainder of the book focuses on the commonlaw and judicial interpretation of the related statutes. Chapters 1 and 2discuss the basic copyright issues; chapter 3, software-related patents;and chapters thereafter involve the copyright issues and litigation thathave been influential in the software copyright arena.In many respects Galler realizes his goal of writing a book that isaccessible to his wide audience. He does not use complex sentencestructures nor overuse technical terminology. He emphasizes understandingthe fundamentals of copyright law and goes forward from that establishedfoundation. A good example is his discussion of the difference between anexpression and an idea. "An idea that leads to a particular kind ofinvention can be patented, while the expression of an idea must becopyrighted to be protected."A separate outline of the cases discussed allows interested readers tograsp the courts' actions and roles in making the laws. In addition, heincludes an example of a patent and an excerpt from a court opinion. Theseall help readers to visualize what the court is examining in trials andwhat the lawyers are examining to determine that law. Numerous hypotheticalsituations also convey the information in an understandable way. Gallerdoes not include many endnotes (which sometimes tend to discourage layreaders)--unnecessary since most of his discussions are based on the cases.Sometimes Galler's work becomes laborious--not the fault of his writingstyle or technique, but of the subject matter. Often the decisions inintellectual property cases involving computer hardware or software turn onvery technical details. Without an understanding or a basic explanation ofthe technical issues at stake, the gravity of the decision and thedistinctions that the court draws will make no sense to readers.This book is excellent for an academic collection, because it will helpthose considering a career in intellectual property. It also is helpful forlay readers who foresee becoming entangled in an intellectual propertydispute. Finally, for attorneys who do not typically practice in this area,Software and Intellectual Property Protection provides a broad overview ofthe current status of the copyright laws impacting software.--Melinda Elder, Librarian,Winstead Sechrest & Minick, HoustonBack to Headline List CopyrightLEGAL INFORMATION ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 1996INTERNATIONAL & FOREIGN LAW --European Union Law GuidePhilip Raworth, ed. 1995. Oceana Publications, Inc.Looseleaf. 3v. ISBN: 0-379-10175-0. $495. Quarterly supplements.The continuing process of European integration, including the discussionsleading to a common European monetary system, has furthered an interest inthe documentation and legislative process of the European Union in bothacademic and private sectors. A major component of this interest involvesthe acquisition and use of the documentation generated by the Union. Whilethe Union generates voluminous amounts of material, researching Union lawhas never been an easy process. The Union itself provides no subjectcompilation of its law, and the indexes provided by private publishersusually do not provide the actual documents. European Union Law Guide,aimed at law firms and academic libraries, attempts to fill this breach.The guide is essentially a collection of documents with little or nonarration or analysis. It is a worthwhile addition to experiencedresearchers' libraries, especially if they do not have access to acollection of the Union's Official Journal, since the majority of thedocuments in the collection are from this source. The table of contentschecklist includes references to "all legislation of any importance," themost important documents are reproduced.Currently, the guide offers access to the commercial and constitutionaldocuments of the Union. Arranged in subject areas familiar to Americanlawyers, the goal is to provide access to all applicable Union legislation.Among the subject areas included are public procurement law; banking law;and the law of gender equality. When completed, the series will consist offive binders that will include materials on social as well as agriculturalpolicies. A binder on the history, politics, and institutions of the Unionis also planned.The guide strives to provide "comprehensive legal and political coverage ofthe Union." While this is a worthy objective, it does come at a heftyprice: $495. Four to five updates per years are planned at $150 to $170each. As with many looseleaf products, the cost of maintenance will soonexceed the cost of the basic subscription.While this work does provide access to many important documents, it doesnot provide the analysis and narrative needed to place them in context. Incomparison, Ralph Folsom's European Union Business Law, published by West,includes both a volume of narrative analysis and a volume of sourcematerial. Although not completely duplicating the European Union Law Guide,the West product provides a similar breadth of source material along withan index of authorities and subject index at a cheaper price.This guide is useful for firm or academic institutions that need acollection of Union documentation but do not have access to a collection ofthe Union's Official Journal. For those with access to the OfficialJournal, this is an expensive compilation of material already available.--William T.

CD-ROM. $400.A question that recently appeared on the Internet is worth repeating here.If vendors cancel their print products, forcing subscribers to purchase theCD-ROMs, was the paper product of any value in the first place? During thepast 24 months I can recall this happening with the BNA EnvironmentalReporter, the CCH Health Care Facilities Manual, and the RIA All States TaxGuide. I have no answer to the question.In either format, the RIA State and Local Taxes is a valuable resourceinvestment. In its CD-ROM format, OnPoint System: All States Tax Guide iseasy to use because of the Folio software. A one-year subscription can bepurchased as an option within the State and Local Tax Service of OnPointSystem for $375.I reviewed this CD-ROM in the DOS format, which requires the use of the tabkey to navigate between the link tokens. The opening screen is divided into51 states (including the District of Columbia), the Spidell California TaxLetter, State and Local Taxes Weekly, What's New, User Support, and aCatalog. For currency in state and local tax information, the What's Newsection does a superb job. This screen is divided into three columns: thelink token to get to the full-text; the state and date; and a one-linedescription.The heart of the information, state and local taxes, is further dividedinto 12 areas: corporate income, property, estate-gift, fuel and mineral,general provisions, initial, sales use, licenses and other taxes, publicutilities, special local, chart-calendar, and search all. I found each ofthese sections to be informative and easy to navigate.While I found this product extremely useful and easy to use, I was somewhatdisappointed by the amount of information provided. Specifically--and thisis offered as a suggestion for improvement--I wanted to see stateDepartment of Revenue rulings in full-text.Back to the Internet question: I wonder if products like this will have afuture if states begin to offer full-text documents on the Internet. Aswith any CD-ROM product, librarians need to do a full cost-benefit analysisto determine whether online or CD-ROM formats would provide maximum benefitfor the least cost. We determined that CD-ROM meets our needs and willstretch our budget.I recommend OnPoint System: All States Tax Guide to those firms whosepractices warrant having this information in this format.

(Dallas, TX), a gas distributor,from cover-to-cover copying and facsimile transmission of"Gas Daily", a newsletter published by Pasha Publications(Arlington, VA).The ruling is the first to clearly prohibit the completephotocopying and in-house distribution of a subsriptionnewsletter. Although there have been similar suits in thepast, they have all been settled out of court, beforejudicial rulings were given. Terms of the settlement werenot revealed, prohibiting disclosure of whether Enmark willpay damages to Pasha.The federal court said that the photocopying of the letter,and its subsequent distribution to other Enmark employeeswithout the publisher's permission, blatantly infringed onPasha's copyright. The ruling came despite the fact thatthe judge found that Enmark was unaware that its actionswere improper or illegal. In explaining the ruling, thecourt said that the copying of the letter "had an obviousdetrimental effect on the potential (subscription) market"for the newsletter.Under the federal copyright law's fair use doctrine,photocopying of publications is legal for research andnon-commercial use. Newsletter publishers have argued forsome time that some subscribers have taken advantage ofthat doctrine to distribute full text copies of newslettersto their employees, thereby reducing the number ofpotential subscribers. Some newsletter publishers offerrewards to subscribers who identify illegal copiers.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE LEGAL PUBLISHER via NewsNetMarch, 1992PRICE COMM. SELLS INTEREST IN N.Y.

The issue: the limitsof money laundering prosecutions based on "willful blindness." The U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has given a major boostto federal money laundering prosecutions in a case prosecuted byCharlotte U.S. Attorney Thomas J. Ashcraft. It has fortified the legal notion that willful blindness, underthe right circumstances, can serve as a substitute for provableactual knowledge on the part of the accused in a money launderingcase. According to the court, the case against Ellen Campbell, a youngNorth Carolina realtor, had the right stuff. In March 1991, shebecame the first realtor in the country to be convicted of moneylaundering. The jury found her guilty under the two federal moneylaundering criminal laws (Title 18, USC Secs. 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and1957). Later that year, federal district Judge Graham C. Mullenoverturned the jury's guilty verdict and acquitted Campbell basedon a post-trial motion by the defense (Money Laundering Alert,November 1991). The evidence showed that she included unreported cash in the saleof a home to a drug dealer, Mark Lawing. He drove flashy cars,lived a carefree life and had expensive tastes. The governmentpresented no evidence that Campbell knew he was a drug dealer(Money Laundering Alert, April 1991). Lawing bought the home at a price of $182,500. He signed acontract to purchase, but his poor credit rating prevented him fromobtaining a mortgage. His parents secured a mortgage for $122,500,and he told Campbell he would pay the sellers the balance "underthe table." She consented. That is the way the deal was done. At the closing Lawing arrivedat Campbell's real estate office carrying a paper bag containing$60,000, which he turned over to the sellers. Campbell did notinclude that sum in the closing statement. Afterwards, she accepteda $200 gratuity from Lawing in addition to her portion of thecommission on the sale. Lawing had earlier pleaded guilty to federal money laundering anddrug charges. He helped the government by testifying againstCampbell. She took the witness stand at trial and testified that Lawing hadtold her he owned a lucrative body shop. The jury concluded thatshe knew the cash involved in the closing was "the proceeds of someform of unlawful activity" and that she was "willfully blind" tothe facts surrounding Lawing and his money. In his instructions to the jury, Judge Mullen said:- "(K)nowledge may be satisfied by inference drawn from proof that(Campbell) deliberately closed her eyes to what would otherwisehave been obvious to her. A finding beyond a reasonable doubt of aconscious purpose to avoid enlightenment would permit an inferenceof knowledge...."- "(That) does not authorize you to find that (Campbell) actedknowingly because she should have known what was occurring ..., orthat (with) hindsight she should have known ... or because she wasnegligent in failing to recognize what was occurring or evenbecause she was reckless or foolish in failing to recognize whatwas occurring....(T)he government must prove ... that (Campbell)...deliberately contrived to avoid learning all of the facts." In his post-trial ruling, the trial judge said that "in order fora party other than the drug dealer to have an intent to conceal theillegal source of the dealer's money, the party must first know thedealer's occupation." The evidence was not enough for conviction, he added. What itshowed was that Lawing was "a spendthrift playboy" who testified henever told Campbell his true occupation, the court said. "More thanjust image must be shown," he wrote. The Fourth Circuit disagreed in an opinion dated September 28,written by Chief Judge Sam Ervin III, son of his famous latefather, Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina. "The central issue ... is whether there was sufficient evidencefor the jury to find that Campbell possessed the knowledge that (1)Lawing's funds were the proceeds of illegal activity, and (2) thetransaction was designed to disguise the nature of those proceeds,"said the court. The court honed in on what it found to be the fatal trial courterror. The trial judge had told the jury that the government'sburden was to show "a purpose of concealment" and "knowledge of thedrug dealers activities" on the part of the accused. That misstates the government's burden, said the Fourth CircuitCourt of Appeals. "The government must only show that the defendantpossesses the knowledge that the transaction was designed toconceal illegal proceeds," said the court. It is a critical decision where the "defendant is a person otherthan the individual who is the source of the tainted money," itsaid. What really matters in cases like Campbell's is not hermotivation. That is "irrelevant," said the court. Her motive "without question," the court said, was to close thedeal and collect her commission "without regard to the source ofthe money" or the sale's effect "in concealing a portion of thepurchase price." The money laundering law only requires the U.S. to show thatCampbell knew "the property involved in a financial transactionrepresents the proceeds of some form of illegal activity," thecourt said. The money laundering law requires that the transaction to be"designed in whole or in part ... to conceal or disguise thenature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control ofthe proceeds of specified unlawful activity" (Title 18, USC Sec.1956(a)(1)(B)). "The omission of $60,000 from all documentation regarding thesales price ... clearly satisfies this standard -- concealing boththe nature and the location of Lawing's illegally derived funds,"the court asserted in a footnote. The "knowledge component" of the money laundering law boils downto a single inquiry, said the court: "Did Campbell know thatLawing's funds were derived from an illegal source?" The trial court should have left that question to the jury todecide, said the appellate panel. It was correct for the trial court to exclude evidence that Lawingwas a "known" drug dealer, but it incorrectly underrated theimportance of Campbell's realtor colleague who testified thatCampbell had told her the cash "may have been drug money." By discounting that testimony because it conflicted with thecolleague's prior grand jury statements, the trial court improperlyinvaded the exclusive province of the jury. "It should have beenleft to the jury to decide," said the court. Lawing's lifestyle wasnot irrelevant, either, the court pointed out. All those factors were "sufficient to create a question for thedeliberately closed her eyes towhat would otherwise have been obvious to her,'" the courtreasoned. A "reasonable jury" could have easily found Campbell guilty onthose facts, concluded the court. It reversed the judgment ofacquittal entered by the trial judge. Under the rules by which theissues were heard, Campbell will now get a new trial (U.S. v.Campbell, Case No. 91-5695, 4th Cir. Ct. App).Back to Headline List CopyrightMONEY LAUNDERING ALERT via NewsNetDecember 1992JUSTICE ISSUES LAUNDERING GUIDELINES For the first time in the six-year history of the federal moneylaundering law, which carries some of the heaviest penalties in theU.S. Code, the nation's 94 U.S. Attorneys will have centralguidelines to follow when they seek to prosecute certain defendantsfor laundering. The Justice Department, saying it wanted "to ensure consistency incertain type of prosecutions" in an area of the law that "isdeveloping very fast," issued new rules of the game for moneylaundering prosecutions. They cover prosecutions under theforfeiture laws (Title 18, USC Secs. 1956 and 1957 and Title 18,USC Secs. 981 and 982). "We must use these powerful tools carefully," say the Department'snew guidelines. In addition to receiving central clearance oncertain money laundering prosecutions, the nation's federalprosecutors will now also be required to report key statistics ontheir use of the laundering laws to Justice. The guidelines require the prior approval of the Department infour categories of cases:- where a case is based "solely" on the extraterritorial reach ofthe money laundering laws- where the sole purpose of the subject financial transaction wasto evade taxes- where the financial transaction involves attorney's fees and anattorney is sought to be prosecuted- where a financial institution, as defined in the BSA regulations,is to be named as a defendant or as an unindicted co-conspirator(31 CFR 103.11). The money laundering section of the Criminal Division will serveas the focal point for the approval process. Federal prosecutorsare required to send copies of the proposed indictment along witha "prosecutive memorandum." The definition of "financial institution" used in the guidelinesdoes not include many businesses defined as such by the BSA, suchcar dealers, jewelers, real estate agents, and insurance companies. The guidelines explicitly state they do not apply to non-bankfinancial institutions, such as check cashers or currency exchangehouses which are not branches of a larger institution. The new rules apply only to prosecutions under the moneylaundering laws. They do not apply to those for failure to file orthe fraudulent filing of currency transaction reports under theBank Secrecy Act. And, they have no effect on BSA prosecutions and forfeitures forstructuring (Title 31, USC Secs. 5324) or on civil forfeitureslinked to money laundering cases (Title 18, USC Sec. 981). In addition to the cases requiring Washington approval before theycan be filed, the guidelines also require federal prosecutors toseek "consultation" with the money laundering section in thesecases:- where they seek forfeiture of a business on the theory that itfacilitated money laundering- where a civil penalty is sought to be imposed under the moneylaundering laws as part of a criminal prosecution for laundering(Title 18, USC Sec. 1956(b))- where the "specified unlawful activity" alleged in a launderingcharge is a financial or fraud crime "so closely connected" thatthere is "no clear delineation" between that crime and the moneylaundering offense. The Department warns prosecutors that where the same financialtransaction is the basis for the specified unlawful activity andthe laundering charge, no money laundering charge should bebrought. The guidelines were issued by Assistant Attorney for the CriminalDivision Robert S. Mueller. They are called "bluesheets" and willbe contained in the U.S. Attorneys' Manual (USAM 9-105.000). Hardly any area of federal jurisprudence is presently as dynamicand volatile as the money laundering field. The new prosecutionguidelines were long in coming. They are not binding. If aprosecutor does not comply with them, the defendant cannotcomplain. The major criticism of the guidelines will focus on the topicsthey do not address. But, they are a beginning toward bringinguniformity to an important area of the law previously molded by 94distinct points of view.--Sarah N.

At its annual meeting in London last month, theInternational Organization of Securities Commissions revealed theresults of the work of a working committee on money laundering. That is a unit formed by IOSCO to analyze the impact of moneylaundering on the securities and futures industries and torecommend ways to deal with it. Recognizing that other financial sectors, notably banking, haveincreased their defenses against money laundering, IOSCO said it isimportant to "ensure that securities and futures markets do notbecome a comparatively more attractive alternative for moneylaunderers." The difficulty in dealing with laundering in the securities fieldis that, usually, little currency is involved in the transactionswhich are commonplace in the industry. It is an industry that runsby computer blips and paper. Its exposure to money laundering comesafter the launderers have disposed of their cash through othermeans. The IOSCO report is the first treatment of the money launderingproblem by the world's securities commissioners. IOSCO was formedin 1986. It is the only global association of governmental bodieswhich regulate the securities and futures markets. The Montreal-based organization has 101 members from 63 countries. In its year-long study, the IOSCO committee worked closely withthe Financial Action Task Force, an organization formed in 1989 bythe Group of Seven major industrialized nations which now has 28member countries. In 1990, the FATF issued 40 recommendations representing a globalblueprint for dealing with money laundering. They have become theguideposts for action by countries and regional bodies around theworld (Money Laundering Alert, May 1990). The IOSCO working group said its objectives are to act as aclearinghouse for information for securities and futures regulatorson money laundering and to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens onlegitimate businesses while preventing illicit proceeds fromentering the markets. The IOSCO report said money laundering can occur in the securitiesindustry in customer accounts which are used only to hold funds andnot for trading. In those cases, banking channels with morestringent money laundering controls are skirted. Other indications of money laundering are what are known as "washtrading" transactions. Those involve the entry of matching buys andsells in particular securities which create the illusion oftrading. Wash trading through multiple accounts generatingoffsetting profits and losses and transfers of positions betweenaccounts that do not appear to be commonly controlled are otherindicators of money laundering. The report makes seven recommendations to the securities industry:- Customer identification procedures should prohibit anonymousaccounts or those in names that clearly appear fictitious andshould require that the identity of new customers be verified.- Recordkeeping requirements should aim to verify the movement offunds in securities transactions and document them fully. Recordsshould be kept for least five years.- Detection and reporting of suspicious transactions, particularlywhere complex and unusual transactions and strange trading patternsexist, should be an industry standard.- To prevent control of securities firms by criminal elements, duediligence procedures should be used to examine the principals oftrading firms. There should be a free exchange of public and non-public information through international sharing agreements.- Model compliance and audit programs to guard against moneylaundering should be established in all securities and futuresfirms.- The use of cash and its equivalents should be discouraged. Thatincludes transferrable bearer shares or debt instruments.- Securities regulators should cooperate with law enforcementagencies resulting in the free and prompt exchange of information. If recognition of a problem is the first step toward its cure,IOSCO has begun the process of confronting the money launderingproblem that no one denies exists in the gigantic securities andfutures industries. Now begins the task of implemention.--Richard M.

Ask Chester L. Walsh. He is nowricher by $13.4 million for having blown the whistle on his formeremployer, the General Electric Company, which earlier this year wasfound guilty of a multi-million dollar corruption scheme. Walsh, a GE employee for 25 years, smuggled documents out ofIsrael which helped prove that Rami Dotan, an Israeli Air ForceGeneral, received about $11 million in payoffs from GE for his helpin assuring that GE kept lucrative F-16 aircraft sales contractswith Israel. The contracts were financed largely with U.S. funds(Money Laundering Alert, August 1992). Walsh was manager of the company's Israel aircraft salesoperations for four years. In 1987, certain events made himsuspicious. He began noting and recording conversations with GEemployees who were involved in the corrupt scheme. He also hired aCalifornia lawyer. Walsh received the largest sum ever paid to a whistleblower. Hefiled what is known as a qui tam proceeding. He, with the aid of aCalifornia group called Taxpayers Against Fraud, sued thegovernment in November 1990 under the False Claims Act, the so-called "whistleblower statute." That law dates back to 1863 and permits individuals to file suitin federal court alleging fraud against the government. It alsopermits a whistleblower to receive up to 25% of the amountrecovered by the government in civil damages. Walsh received 22.5%(Title 31, USC Sec. 3730(b)(1)). Walsh's attorney, John Phillips, says the case is a "total slap inthe face to GE and the Justice Department." They had argued thatWalsh did not deserve payment because he had purposely delayedreporting the wrongdoing in order to increase his potential award. GE says that if Walsh had "dealt honestly" with the company, thefraud could have been detected and reported much earlier and couldhave saved the government millions of dollars. In his ruling, Cincinnati federal Judge Carl B. Rubin said theopposite was true and that the government would in fact make a"profit" of at least $4 million. Phillips described GE's claims as "absurd." He said his client hadto maintain silence in order to protect himself and that thetreatment of whistleblowers by GE gave Walsh reason to fear for hisjob and personal safety. "This is not the type of suit you file lightly," Phillips said."You must have full evidence." While working in Israel, Walsh had gone to another GE employeewith his concerns. When too many questions were raised, thatemployee was transferred out of the country. Judge Rubin concluded that without Walsh it would have been"difficult, if not impossible" to sustain a case against GE. Healso said that Walsh's actions as an individual were not importantand that the important issue is the concept of whistleblowers. "No one likes snitches, but they can be valuable," Rubin said."This is not the first case where this Court has noted theantagonism of the Justice Department to a whistleblower. The reasoncontinues to be unknown, but the attitude is clear." Walsh recently described the court ruling as "the end of a longand stressful five years."  Now retired in Florida, he plans togive half the award to Taxpayers Against Fraud which assistsclaimants under the whistleblower statute (Case Nos. CR 1-92-87 andCiv. C-1-90-792, So. Dis. Oh.).Back to Headline List CopyrightMONEY LAUNDERING ALERT via NewsNetDecember 1992BUSH TAX VETO WEAKENS CID MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORT The day after the November 3rd election, President Bush vetoed a$27 billion tax bill partly in deference to his campaign promise of"no new taxes." While his action spared some U.S. taxpayers of alarger tax bite, it also grievously hurt the capabilities of theIRS's Criminal Investigation Division in the money launderingeffort. The CID is a key player in that effort. Its ability to developcases through artful undercover investigations gains the admirationof most. Undercover investigations usually require start-up money.With any luck, profits from doing business with the bad guys,undercover, pay or defray the government's costs. It is a bonanza for the taxpayer: the bad guys supply the cashwhich fuels the mechanism designed to cause their demise. They payfor their own indictment. Sometimes they supply enough cash, incommissions charged by the federal agents posing as moneylaunderers, to support the next undercover job. All major federal investigative agencies, except the CID, havestanding authority to "churn" those profits. That means they canplow the profits back into the operation or use them for anotherundercover job without having to dip into their agency's budget. In the case of the CID, the budget is controlled at the locallevel by the IRS District Directors who are not attached to the CIDand who usually have no law enforcement experience. If the CID cannot churn the profits, they have to be put into thegeneral treasury of the U.S., probably never to be seen again forlaw enforcement purposes. Instead, the CID must seek funds from thebudget allocated annually to each of the 63 IRS districts. Churning undercover profits, federal agents say, is a goodinvestment because it spares the taxpayer of having to fund much ofthe effort against the criminals in society. Moreover, they say,undercover operations that don't have to beg, borrow, and steal, inorder to function, will reap much greater rewards for the taxpayer. Why? Because a more credible undercover facade lands bigger fishand locates more assets the government can later seize. The veto by President Bush terminated the CID's ability to churnits undercover profits. They are not insignificant, ranging to 2,4, or 6 percent of the dirty money which the undercover agents"launder" for the criminals. The result of the veto: CID undercover operations will be scaledback, and the profits which criminals unwittingly pay to governmentagents go into the "black hole" of the general treasury. The other CID tool which was emasculated by the veto was the IRSability to freely disseminate data from IRS Form 8300 to otherfederal agencies. That form reports cash receipts of more than$10,000 received by trades and businesses, such as car and boatdealers, realtors, lawyers and other businesses. It can providemissing pieces to a financial jigsaw puzzle agents are grapplingwith. Because it is authorized by the tax code and thus considered a taxreturn, Form 8300 is treated differently than IRS Form 4789, whichis authorized by the Bank Secrecy Act (Title 26, USC Sec. 6050I andTitle 31, USC Sec. 5313). The inability to share freely the data from Form 8300 creates anuneven playing field for the government and strips away the logicof the federal cash reporting regimen. Ideally, cash paid to atrade or business is reported on Form 8300 and subsequentlyreported on Form 4789 which is filed by the financial institutionwhere the business banks. That provides a paper trail for cashwhich is otherwise untraceable. It helps agencies, such as the FBI,the Customs Service, and the DEA, follow that cash flow. Presentlythey can't. Until the new Congress, which convenes next month, acts to remedythose problems, the CID will operate with one hand tied behind itsback.Back to Headline List CopyrightMONEY LAUNDERING ALERT via NewsNetDecember 1992MISSING CTRS COST BANK $65,000 PENALTY The Treasury Department announced this month that it imposed a$65,000 civil penalty under the Bank Secrecy Act against a smallArizona bank for failure to file IRS Form 4789, the CurrencyTransaction Report, on several occasions. It is the fifth, andpossibly final, BSA penalty in 1992. Caliber Bank, based in Phoenix, committed the violations duringthe period from November 1989 to February 1992. They werediscovered when BankAmerica Corporation, which owns Caliber,performed an internal compliance audit of the bank. Neither Treasury nor Caliber Bank officials responded to questionsabout the number of CTR violations that were discovered. Treasurysaid it took into account the bank's voluntary disclosure of theinfractions in assessing the penalty. Treasury said another factor that mitigated the penalty was theimprovement in the bank's compliance programs instituted by the newmanagement. The BSA requires financial institutions to file Form 4789 when acash transaction of more than $10,000 is conducted by a customer.The forms assist the government in tracking money laundering, taxevasion and other criminal activities (Title 31, USC Sec. 5313). Treasury's Office of Financial Enforcement has been criticizedseverely this year by the House Ways and Means OversightSubcommittee and the General Accounting Office for its slow penaltyprocess (Money Laundering Alert, April and July 1992). Of the fivecivil penalties this year, two have been levied in the past threemonths. Founded in April 1985, Caliber Bank has gone through many changesin its short history. It was created by Valley Capital Corporation,which is Nevada-based. Last spring, Caliber was acquired byBankAmerica Corporation. Since then, Caliber has grown from ninebranches to 40. BankAmerica has agreed to sell the forty Caliber branches to aCalifornia investment group named Independent Bancorp in whichPeter Ueberroth, the former major league baseball commissioner, andAnthony M. Frank, former Postmaster General, are principals. Theapplication for the merger is pending with the Federal ReserveBoard. The Caliber BSA violations occurred under prior management. Nocriminal charges were brought against the bank or its employees.Back to Headline List CopyrightMONEY LAUNDERING ALERT via NewsNetDecember 1992FED IMPOSES $200,000 CIVIL PENALTY ON PAKISTANI BANK Last February, large advertisements in several major newspapers,placed by the State Bank of Pakistan, offered "bearer certificatesin foreign currency" under conditions of total secrecy. The ad saidthere would be "no questions asked about source of funds!" and noidentity would be disclosed. The Pakistani offering was short-lived. Five days after the adsappeared, the bank, which is the country's central bank, canceledthe sale of the bonds in the U.S. and postponed sales elsewhereafter several U.S. officials expressed shock at the brazen moneylaundering solicitation. In March, by letter responding to questions from Senator JohnKerry (D. Mass.), Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspansaid the Fed had sent examiners to three Pakistani-owned banksoperating in the U.S., the National Bank of Pakistan, Habib Bankand United Bank. Greenspan said the U.S. had received assurances from the banksthat the bearer certificates would not be issued in the U.S. Hesaid the Fed had consulted with the Securities and ExchangeCommission to determine compliance with U.S. securities laws. Hesaid the Fed was continuing to "evaluate the implications of theadvertisement and the information it contains." The results of the Federal Reserve's examination of the threePakistani banks are now known. On September 28, the Fed announceda comprehensive cease and desist order directed at the Chicagobranch of the National Bank of Pakistan. The Fed also imposed a $200,000 civil penalty against the bank forits failure to comply with various recordkeeping and reportingprovisions of the Bank Secrecy Act. Details of those violationswere not disclosed. The cease and desist order requires the bank to undertake a numberof "affirmative actions" to assure compliance with the BSA. Priorto the order, the bank was required to submit to the Fed, the FDIC,and the Illinois banking commissioner a detailed BSA complianceprogram designed to ensure that the Chicago branch of the bankcomplies with "all the provisions of the BSA." The Chicago branch was put on notice that it must exercise specialcare to control and monitor "the flow of funds to and from the(branch) to persons and entities" in and out of the U.S. Aninnovative aspect of the order mandates the creation by the branchof a "know your customer" policy with the ability to:- identify and confirm the identity of each customer- "predict with relative certainty the types of transactions thateach of the customers ... is likely to transact"- monitor customer transactions to see if they are "inconsistentwith the customer's regular and ordinary practices"- investigate and, where necessary, prohibit transactions wherecustomer identity cannot be confirmed or where a transaction isinconsistent with the customer's "normal practices and nosatisfactory explanation exists." The Fed's order also prohibits two unnamed employees of theChicago branch from any duties involving cash transactions or BSAcompliance and requires the employment of an individual, acceptableto federal authorities, to supervise BSA compliance. The bank will be obligated to furnish quarterly reports to the Fedand the FDIC detailing compliance with the terms of the cease anddesist order. The Pakistani-owned bank may not be finished with all of itsregulatory problems.

On the theory that tongues are loosened with incentives of cashrewards, Congress authorized the Justice Department to pay "awardsfor information or assistance directly relating to violation" ofthe money laundering, cash reporting, and structuring laws. Under the new law, Justice is permitted to pay such awards fromits bulging Asset Forfeiture Fund. Previously, it was permitted topay awards from the fund only in matters that pertain to violationsof the "criminal drug laws of the U.S." (Title 28, USC Sec.524(c)(1)(B)). The new award for public assistance is not the first in the moneylaundering field. The Bank Secrecy Act contains a provision givingthe Treasury Department authority to "pay a reward to an individualwho provides original information" leading to a criminal fine,civil penalty, or forfeiture of more than $50,000, connected to aBSA violation. That reward cannot exceed 25 percent of the government's recovery,or $150,000, "whichever is less."  Since the enactment of thatprovision, no reward is believed to have been paid. It is not knownwho, if anyone, has applied (Title 31, USC Secs. 5323).Back to Headline List CopyrightMONEY LAUNDERING ALERT via NewsNetDecember 1992TREASURY NOW HAS ITS OWN FORFEITURE FUND There has always been a rivalry between the law enforcementagencies of the Treasury Department (IRS, Customs Service andSecret Service) and those in the Justice Department (FBI and DEA).The turf and resources battles are often fought behind closed doorsin Washington, but sometimes they spill out and affect theperformance of the agencies in the field. Neither side likes to be outgunned by the other. If one gets a newwidget, the other says it cannot function without it. The result,in some cases, is duplication of resources often running into thetens of millions of dollars. The latest example may be the recent creation by Congress of aTreasury Department Forfeiture Fund which will mirror theforfeiture fund already operating in the Justice Department. Eachfund will contain the property, including cash, forfeited byconstituent agencies of each department. The Justice ForfeitureFund, now about six years old, administers more than $1 billion inforfeited property at any given time. The Treasury Forfeiture Fund was created as part of the recentlyenacted Treasury Department appropriations bill (H.R.5488). The lawpermits Treasury to utilize the fund for a variety of purposesincluding the hiring of outside contractors to administer forfeitedproperties, payment of mortgages and liens on the property,"equitable sharing" payments to state and local enforcementagencies and foreign governments which assist in Treasury cases,payment of awards for assistance in Treasury forfeitures, andpurchase of evidence used in money laundering cases and forfeitureactions.

How wisely theyare administered will be on the agenda of the new administration.Back to Headline List CopyrightMONEY LAUNDERING ALERT via NewsNetDecember 1992U.S. DOLLARS MOTIVATE STATES TO JOIN LAUNDERING EFFORT Recognizing that money laundering can be fought by federal andstate combatants shoulder-to-shoulder compatibly, the federalgovernment is offering $600,000 in grants to state AttorneysGeneral and local prosecutors to beef up their effort. The available grants were announced on November 9 in the FederalRegister, the official repository of all federal offerings andnotices (57 Fed. Reg. 217, p. 53352). A "statewide prosecutorial authority" to deal with moneylaundering and other financial crimes is what the grants seek tofoment. There are some strings attached. They will be issued by theBureau of Justice Assistance, an element of the Justice Department. The announcement says an eligible grantee must be in a state thathas:- a money laundering statute- a "financial reporting statute" similar to the Bank Secrecy Act(Title 31, USC Secs. 5311-5328)- a reporting statute for "non-bank financial institutions,"especially where "currency exchange businesses" border on Mexico orCanada. To further cement ties to the federal effort, the grant says theprevailing parties must be in a state that has signed a "memorandumof understanding" with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.All but ne of the states have already done so. FinCEN, which is housed in the Treasury Department, receives andanalyzes millions of pieces of data contained in the various formsthe public at large is required to file with the government. If a state does not quite have the indicated laws and agreements,the grant announcement says a saving grace will be the presentconsideration of such reforms by the state legislature. Eligible state legal offices will improve their chances for thefederal grants if they reside in states which:- have statewide grand jury laws- use "post-seizure analysis teams" in their offices- are the "designated FinCEN coordinator for the state." A vow to cooperate with the FinCEN coordinator is required ofthose who do not hold that title. Several states are preparing their constituent agencies to applyfor the grants. Some, such as Texas, are considering legislationthat would meet the grant conditions. Others, such as Illinois,have recently met the standards in large measure. Spawning a flock of states to do effective battle in the moneylaundering war may create innovations and will increase the numberof public officials making requests for the books and records offinancial institutions. The formal grant announcement of the Bureau of Justice Assistancewill be available, it is expected, in the middle of January. Therewill be 120 days to file grant requests. The winners will probablybe selected 30 days later. As many as 20 applications are expected.Back to Headline List CopyrightMONEY LAUNDERING ALERT via NewsNetDecember 1992CARRIBBEAN STATES MEET, ISSUE LAUNDERING DECLARATION In many nations the pace of legislative and regulatory activity onmoney laundering has quickened. One reason: the imminent deadlinewithin the European Community for implementing the EC's moneylaundering directive. Legislative bodies throughout the continent are exploring laws tocomply with the terms of the directive (Money Laundering Alert, May1991). The Cortes in Spain and Germany's Bundestag are twoexamples. Here are some important developments.With prodding from big nations, Caribbean nations say they willstep up effort No global solution to the world's money laundering problem ispossible without the active participation of the Caribbean nations.Everyone knows that. Many of them are premier laundering centers. Their proximity to the world's largest cocaine producers andexporters, in South America's Andean region, and the largestgenerator of drug dollars, the U.S., makes the region a convenientbank for many international criminals, including drug dealers. That is why five large nations, who are involved in their ownmoney laundering control efforts, spearheaded a gathering lastmonth in Jamaica of 17 Caribbean nations. The U.S., U.K., France,Canada, and the Netherlands were the catalysts. The two-day meeting started November 5 in Kingston some 29 monthsafter an initial Caribbean meeting in Aruba June 1990. At the conclusion, the nations issued a "Kingston Declaration onMoney Laundering." The Declaration expressed solidarity with the1988 United Nations Convention on Illicit Trafficking on NarcoticDrugs which has money laundering provisions. Not all Caribbeannations have yet ratified it. The declaration also agreed to implement the 40 recommendationsissued by the G-7 FATF in 1990 and the 19 additional ones issued atthe 1990 Aruba meeting (Money Laundering Alert, August 1990). The declaration also accepted the offer of Trinidad and Tobago tohost next year's meeting and to provide facilities for asecretariat of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force. The secretariat will be led by a steering group comprised of CFATFmembers and the larger nations. The steering group will haverepresentatives from each group of Caribbean nations such as theDutch and Spanish language member nations. The secretariat will coordinate self-assessment procedures, helpevaluate members' progress, act as a clearing house for trainingand technical assistance, and serve as liaison with non-membercountries and international organizations. It will report annually. The declaration recommended laws:- defining money laundering based on the model laws issued by theOrganization of American States last May (Money Laundering Alert,June 1992)- concerning the seizure and forfeiture of drug proceeds and linkedassets. They should enable the identification, tracing andevaluation of property subject to seizure, and permit freezingorders.- allowing judicial challenges to seizure orders by anadministrative body- permitting forfeiture in all cases following conviction- permitting courts to decide that "all property obtained during aprescribed period of time by a person convicted of drug traffickinghas been derived from such criminal activity." The Caribbean nations also agreed to enter into mutual assistanceagreements with each other to assist in money laundering cases. They also agreed that money laundering should be an extraditableoffense subject to simplified procedures and that forfeited assetsshould be shared among cooperating nations. The declaration's terms would:- permit continuation of numbered accounts at financialinstitutions with the understanding that account information wouldbe made available to "competent authorities" upon request andinsist on strong legal requirements on customer identification- insist that in large currency transactions, customeridentification procedures and recordkeeping are "mandatory"- amend bank secrecy laws to allow the reporting of suspicioustransactions by financial institutions, but make it optionalwhether a statute is required The Caribbean money laundering effort seems to react only to theprodding of the larger nations. If the gathering in Kingston doesnot produce results, the money laundering control efforts of thelarger nations will be for naught.Bank of England expresses worry of use of wire transfers aslaundering tools A very active player in the world money laundering control effort,the Bank of England last month voiced concern about thesusceptibility of international funds payments systems to moneylaundering. "The increasing efficiency and integration of the world'sfinancial system creates an environment that organized criminalsare only too ready to exploit," said the British central bank inits Quarterly Bulletin. U.K. bankers are taking their suspicious transaction reportingduties seriously. About 12,000 such reports will be filed this yearcompared to 4,087 last year. Yet, only two financial institutionemployees have been prosecuted under the nation's money launderinglaw. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telcommunications,a major clearing system known as SWIFT, has told its users toinclude the names and addresses of senders and recipients ofelectronic funds transfers. In London in late October, the government proposed legislationthat would greatly expand the reach of the nation's present moneylaundering law. If the proposed law is enacted, money launderingfrom all offenses, not just drug trafficking, will be subject tocriminal charges. The proposed law will also facilitate forfeiture of a drugtrafficker's assets. A greater danger awaits those in financialinstitutions who do not report suspicious transactions. Suspicioustransaction reporting is the heart of the British money launderingcontrol system.

The other is expected to deal with the treatmentof multiple transactions on IRS Form 4789, the Currency TransactionReport. The form asks in Line 3(d) to indicate whether a "multipletransaction" was the reason the identification details about theperson "who conducted this transaction" are not stated on the form. Treasury's Administrative Rulings are a means by which affectedfinancial institutions are guided on BSA compliance questions. Theyhave been nonexistent in the last few years. From the date of thefirst one on June 22, 1988 to the eighth one on December 21, 1989,less than 18 months passed. In the intervening 36 months, Treasuryhas issued none. In addition to Administrative Rulings, Treasury also providesguidance to inquiring institutions through "private rulings," whichare written responses by the Office of Financial Enforcement. The letters explain appropriate conduct under the BSA or construeits provisions. The private rulings flow from Treasury in a steady,albeit slow, stream to institutions across the country. Inquiriescan be directed to: Office of Financial Enforcement, U.S. TreasuryDepartment, 1500 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, DC 20202.(CHECK) Its telephone number is (202) 622-0400.Santa Claus robber can help himself by proving his money laundering The money laundering issue appears to be one for all seasons.Jeffrey Stenner, a Connecticut restauranteur, dressed up as SantaClaus on December 20, 1988 and robbed an armored truck of more than$695,000 while it was making its rounds at a bank. He pleadedguilty to that charge and the government agreed to drop anotherarmored truck robbery charge involving the theft of $1.1 million. Federal district Judge Alan H. Nevas does not believe Stenner'sstory that all the money was spent and that no cash hoard awaitshim after he completes the sentence the judge is about to impose. The U.S. Probation Office has suggested to the judge that thesentence be increased from the term indicated by the federalsentencing guidelines (78 to 97 months) if Stenner has hidden partof his loot. "I am convinced that there is a cash hoard out there that awaitsMr. Stenner when he is released from jail....He'd be out in sevenyears....That's a nice tidy sum to support him for the rest of hislife," said the judge at the sentencing hearing last month. The solution: See if Stenner can prove how he laundered and spentthe $1.7 million he stole. IRS agents working the case cannotaccount for nearly a million dollars of the total. Judge Nevas rescheduled the sentencing until later this month tosee if Stenner was an artful money launderer. If so, his sentencemay be less than what the judge is inclined to impose.Back to Headline List CopyrightMONEY LAUNDERING ALERT via NewsNetDecember 1992ADMINISTRATIVE RULINGS BY THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT UNDER THE BANKSECRECY ACT             Administrative Rulings by the Treasury             Department under the Bank Secrecy Act-Column 1Ruling Number88-188-288-388-488-589-189-289-5--Column 2Date IssuedJune 22, 1988June 22, 1988June 22, 1988August 2, 1988August 2, 1988January 12, 1989June 21, 1989December 21, 1989Column 3SubjectReporting structured or suspicious transactionsFiling of Customs Service Form 4790 by banks when they know moneywas transported into the U.S. by its customer.Duty to report on IRS Form 4789 "cash-back" transactions of exemptcustomers exceeding $10,000.Bank's duty to note on its exemption list the identities ofmultiple establishments which coondust transactions in exemptaccount.Duty of bank to report on Form 4789 cash received indirectly froma customer through an armored car service hired by the bank.Exemptions from currency transaction reporting to banks for groupsof existing accounts of the same customer.Aggregating currency transactions of exempt customers who haveestablished separate accounts for multiple establishments they own.Meeting the requirement of Form 4789 that information be furnishedabout the person "on whose behalf" a transaction is beingconducted.-  Source: 31 CFR, Part 103, Appendix-- Administrative Ruling numbers 89-3 and 89-4 were not used.

Vinson & Elkins, HarrisCty., TX, Dist. Ct., No. 90-24849).     The award consisted of $17.7 million in actual damages,$1 million in punitive damages and $3 million in special damages.The jury concluded that the firm had engaged in gross negligence;breach of fiduciary duty for its own gain; civil conspiracy;"false, misleading or deceptive acts"; and knowingly"unconscionable action" in handling the estate.     According to the complaint, William Moran died in November1983, leaving an estate estimated to be worth $80 million, andVinson & Elkins (V&E) undertook representation of the estateafter another firm was forced to withdraw.  In addition torepresenting the estate itself, V&E also represented the variousMoran companies, which were primarily in the oil and gasbusiness.     The plaintiffs say that, from the beginning of V&E'srepresentation of the estate, the firm concealed a number ofconflicts of interest, including the fact that its managingpartner was a director and trust committee member of First CityBancorporation of Texas, and that many V&E attorneys owned stockin the bank.  In addition, the firm concealed negative financialinformation about the bank and conspired to prolong theadministration of the estate so that the bank and V&E could"continue to exploit the estate for excessive executor's andattorneys' fees and expenses," said the plaintiffs.     Other examples of V&E's negligence, the plaintiffs said,included improper tax advice; business ventures which cost theestate substantial amounts of money because V&E had "numerousfinancial, professional and personal ties" with the companiesinvolved in the deals; and failure to reveal that First City was"engaging in self-dealing by manipulating the maintenance ofshort-term, low interest investment of estate assets."               In its answer, V&E responded that (1) the plaintiffs lackstanding to sue because they lacked privity of contract with V&E;and (2) the causes of action included in the complaint are notassignable.  The firm counterclaimed that the suit was broughtfor the purpose of harassment.     The plaintiffs were represented by Brodus Spivey and ThomasPrehoditch of Spivey, Grigg, Kelly & Knisely in Austin.  Counselfor V&E were Richard Caldwell and Laura Ware of Mayor, Day,Caldwell & Keeton in Houston.Back to Headline List CopyrightPROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 1994CH. 11 EXAMINER CRITICAL OF LAW FIRM'S LACK OF DISCLOSURE     In a report unsealed at the end of August, bankruptcy court-appointed examiner Charles Stillman criticized Leslie FayCompanies counsel Weil Gotshal & Manges for not beingdisinterested while representing the estate and for not makingproper disclosure of conflicts of interest as mandated by theBankruptcy Code (In re: The Leslie Fay Companies, Inc., et al.;SD NY Bank., No. 93 B 41724 (TLB)).     Stillman concluded that, because the conflict in this casearose from the appearance of impropriety rather than from actualconduct harming the estates, the bankruptcy court should consideras a sanction a limited disallowance of the legal fees incurredby the firm, based on the cost of the investigation.     According to the report, which was originally filed underseal on May 27, Weil Gotshal was retained by Leslie Fay inFebruary 1993 to assist with an investigation of certainaccounting irregularities in the company's general ledger.  Aftersubstantial losses in income were revealed as a result of theinvestigation, Leslie Fay was no longer able to obtain financingarrangements to operate its businesses, and filed for Chapter 11protection in April 1993.  The bankruptcy court authorized WeilGotshal's employment as counsel to the Leslie Fay debtors.     The issue of Weil Gotshal's disinterestedness was firstraised when the firm filed its application for fees.  Thecreditors' committee and the trustee objected to the fee request,saying that there were questions about the firm's disclosure ofits relationships with various parties related to Leslie Fay.Stillman was appointed in December 1993.     Stillman said that the pre-petition audit committee-relatedrelationships of Weil Gotshal included representation of BearStearns and Odyssey Partners, several of whose employees weremembers of the Leslie Fay audit committee.  He describes WeilGotshal's professional relationships with Bear Stearns andOdyssey as "significant."  The examiner also stated that, at thetime Weil Gotshal was appointed as bankruptcy counsel, itsregular computerized conflicts-check was not performed, as thecompany had already been representing the company for severalmonths.     With respect to Weil Gotshal's post-petitionrepresentations, Stillman said that the firm represented a numberof Leslie Fay directors in a securities class-action lawsuit andgovernment investigations which followed revelation of theaccounting problems at the company.  He investigated assertionsthat Weil Gotshal's "insistence" on resolving the securitiesfraud claims against officers and directors, which, in turn,implicated officers' and directors' indemnification claimsagainst Leslie Fay, inhibited a prompt reorganization plan.  Heconcluded that there was no documentary evidence to supportclaims that Weil Gotshal's position was designed to further theindividual officers' and directors' interests to the detriment ofthe estate.     In preparing his reports, Stillman relied upon thebankruptcy code 327 standard for the employment of professionals,which requires that such professionals hold no interest adverseto the estate and be disinterested persons, not just at thebeginning of their employ, but throughout the period ofemployment.  He noted the difficulty of interpreting whatconstitutes "adverse interest," as the code does not define thephrase.  In considering the code's underlying policies, theexaminer said that counsel for the debtor need not always be"perfectly disinterested": the test is one of materiality --whether the firm had a material adverse interest.     Turning to the judicial definition of "adverse interest" inthe context of multiple representations, Stillman reviewedrulings of the First, Third and 10th Circuit Courts of Appeal, aswell as a number of bankruptcy courts.  He also consideredattorney codes of ethics with respect to the issues of exerciseof independent professional judgment, impaired judgment ordivided loyalties, and "avoiding even the appearance ofimpropriety."     Stillman concluded that Weil Gotshal's multiplerepresentations and relationships with respect to the Leslie Faydebtors and the audit committee members and their related firmsconstituted holding and representing materially adverse interestsin violation of Section 327(a).  In addition, he rejected thefirm's argument that it did not have to disclose thoseconnections because it did not consider them adverse to theestate.     Stillman said, "The firm's failure to disclose led tosignificant burden and cost to the estates and put a cloud overits representation....  [Its] failure to disclose frustrated animportant component of the bankruptcy system -- that aprofessional's qualifications be evaluated at the outset so thatbankruptcy cases can proceed without any taint of partiality orthe appearance of partiality, of the professionals involved."               Stillman is a partner in the New York City firm of Stillman,Friedman & Shaw.Back to Headline List CopyrightPROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 1994ZALE: AKIN GUMP LIABLE FOR MALPRACTICE FOR LBO-RELATED ACTIONS     Jewel Recovery, L.P., Zale Corp.'s litigation entity, filedsuit on May 16 against its former law firm, Akin Gump StraussHauer & Feld, and partner Alan Feld, charging the firm and Feldwith professional and gross negligence, aiding and abettingbreaches of fiduciary duty, fraud, fraudulent conveyance andimproper distribution of corporate dividends (In re ZaleCorporation, ND TX Bank., No. 392-30001-SAF-11; Jewel Recovery,LP v. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld et al., No. 394-3335).     According to the complaint, the defendants participated withPeoples Jewelers Limited's directors Irving Gerstein, CharlesGill and James Gillies in undertaking a number of post-LBOtransactions which resulted in severely reducing Zale's assets,paying dividends to a shell entity and denuding a Zale affiliate.Defendant Feld, who was a Zale Credit Corporation (ZCC) director,is charged with conflicts of interest in his overlapping roles asZCC director and name partner of Akin Gump.     The plaintiff characterizes Zale's 1989 $438 million LBO ofGordon Jewelry Corporation as "the beginning of the end for theDebtors," as the price was two to three times the value of thecompany and the debt assumed by Gordon to finance the transactionleft Gordon insolvent.  Because Akin Gump acted as specialcounsel to Zale in the acquisition, the firm knew or should haveknown that the LBO would ruin Gordon financially, says Jewel.     After the LBO was consummated, Akin Gump also representedGordon in connection with an offering of public debt,representing that the company's projected earnings would growexponentially after the acquisition, says Jewel.  In addition,although Zale was its client, Akin Gump allowed the company torelease People and Swarovski International Holding fromguarantees on notes which had been secured prior to the GordonLBO.  Toronto-based Peoples and Swarovski of Switzerland boughtZale in 1986 for $640 million.     With respect to the "denuding" of ZCC, Jewel claims that aseries of transactions at a time when Feld had the "ultimateauthority" to approve or disapprove ZCC's investments led, amongother blunders, to a disastrous investment in Gordon'sReceivables Trust, which was represented by Akin Gump, and ZCC'spayment in early 1991 of a $50 million "alleged dividend" to itssole shareholder, Zale.     Jewel claims that the defendants engaged in fraud in a stocktransaction in connection with the Gordon LBO, arguing that theseries of transactions which constituted the LBO involved stockin a corporation, and, therefore, was a stock transaction as theterm is used in the Texas Business and Commerce Code.  "Theprospectus governing the issuance of the Gordon Senior Notespresented unrealistic and fraudulent projections as truthful andrealistic...," and Akin failed to disclose the falsity of therepresentations, says Jewel.     The complaint also states that the legal fees paid to AkinGump for its representation of Gordon in the LBO were madepursuant to and were an integral part of the LBO.  Jewel isseeking recovery of the fees as fraudulent conveyances under theTexas Business and Commerce Code because Gordon allegedly did notreceive reasonable equivalent value for Akin Gump's services, andwas insolvent at the time the fees were paid.     Feld's breach of fiduciary duty as director of ZCC allegedlyresulted in $150 million in damages to Zale, says the complaint,and his role in the improper distribution resulted in $50 millionin damages.  The damages proximately caused by the grossnegligence of the ZCC directors, including Feld's grossnegligence, is not less than $150 million, says Jewel.     The complaint was filed by James McCarthy, David Kent andDavid Roberts of Hughes & Luce in Dallas.Back to Headline List CopyrightPROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 1994AR JUDGE DISMISSES ATTEMPT TO BLOCK SUBPOENA OF FIRM DOCUMENTS     A federal judge in Little Rock, AR, on Aug. 10 dismissed aspremature a suit filed by the Rose Law Firm against theResolution Trust Corp. seeking to block a subpoena for documentsconcerning all the firm's clients going back to 1985 (Rose LawFirm v. Resolution Trust Corp. et al., ED AR, Western Div., Civ.No. LR-C-94-21; see Andrews' Professional Liability LR, July1994, P. 17).     In making the decision, U.S. District Judge Henry Woods"confess[ed] serious misgivings about the scope of thissubpoena...[which] demands the production of a broad range ofdocuments covering more than ten years."  He also said that theRose firm "was understandably disturbed by the scope of thesubpoena," with which it was expected to comply within 10 days.     Nevertheless, the judge said that he was persuaded by theposition advanced by RTC and its Office of Inspector General(OIG).     The judge cited the following excerpt from OIG's brief:"One of the most firmly established principles of administrativelaw is that courts cannot exercise jurisdiction over attempts bysubpoena recipients to secure judicial review of administrativeagency subpoenas....  [T]he courts uniformly hold that suchchallenges are not ripe for judicial review.  Sinceadministrative subpoenas are not self-executing, recipients ofsuch subpoenas can raise their procedural and substantiveobjections, including objections to the validity of theunderlying investigation, only if and when the government seeksto enforce its subpoena in court."     Rose's managing partner, Ronald Clark, said the firm "willnot comply with the subpoena absent a court order."  He said thatthe firm had not decided whether to appeal Judge Woods' ruling.     RTC/OIG issued the subpoena in connection with aninvestigation into possible "conflicts of interest" at the Rosefirm, where First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was once a partner.The probe resulted from controversy over investments made byPresident and Mrs. Clinton in the "Whitewater" planned resortdevelopment when the president was governor of Arkansas.  TheClintons' co-investor was the owner of the now-defunct MadisonGuaranty Savings & Loan Association of Little Rock.  Thedevelopment never got off the ground, and the Clintonspurportedly lost money on the deal.  Rose has acknowledged thatit represented the thrift in a few isolated matters but insistedit was never the thrift's primary counsel.     On April 26 of this year, Rose sued for a declaratoryjudgment that the subpoena is void because it seeks informationprotected by the attorney-client privilege, work productdoctrine, and the Arkansas Rules of Professional Responsibility.RTC argued that the Rose action was premature because the courthas not been asked by either RTC or OIG to enforce the subpoena.     RTC is represented by Robert E. Craddock Jr. and LeslieGattas Coleman of Dyer, James and Taylor in Memphis, TN, and byRTC staff counsel Jonathan B. Taylor in Washington, DC.  Inaddition to Clark, Rose is represented by staff attorneys JerryC. Jones and David L. Williams, and by Walter B. Stuart andAndrew J.

Boston Consulting Group,Inc., ND OH, No. 1:94 CV 1763).     Figgie said, in addition, that Boston Consulting (BCG)engaged in negligence, negligent misrepresentation and breach offiduciary duty.  Figgie is seeking "no less than" $2 million indamages.     According to the complaint, Figgie engaged BCG to develop aseries of management projects to generate business and marketinformation and time-based capability (TBC) programs for Figgie.BCG allegedly promised that Figgie would realize "above-averagegrowth and maximum profitability within a three-year period oftime."  Under the engagement letter between the two parties, BCGwas supposed to establish a budget for each project and promisedthat fees charged would not exceed the budget amount.  In spiteof BCG's assertions, says Figgie, there were no fixed fee billingarrangements with BCG.     The company says BCG breached its contract with Figgie by(1) failing to deliver the accurate market studies and businessreports and the TBC programs and TBC results; and (2) byconsistently overbilling Figgie for services and expenses.  BCG'snegligence is evidenced by its (1) failure to use qualified andappropriately supervised personnel; (2) failure to properly planand schedule the various consulting projects; and (3) failure toexecute the projects in a timely manner, the complaint contends.     The complaint was filed by Richard Cusick, William Coughlinand Anthony LaCerva of Calfee, Halter & Griswold in Cleveland.Back to Headline List CopyrightPROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 1994HHC, OTHERS CLAIM FORMER FINANCIERS BETRAYED THEIR FIDUCIARYOBLIGATIONS     Hillsborough Holdings Corp., Walter Industries Inc.,Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) and others on Sept. 8 filedsuit against financiers Leon Black and Marc J. Rowan, claimingthe two betrayed their fiduciary obligations by profiting frominformation about Walter Industries gathered while representingKKR (In re Hillsborough Holdings Corp., MD FL Bankr., Nos. 89-9715-8P1 through 89-9746-8P1 and 90-11997-8P1; HillsboroughHoldings Corp. et al. v. Black et al., Adv. No. 94-562).     In their suit, the plaintiffs allege that Black and Rowan,who served as investment bankers for KKR while at Drexel BurnhamLambert, Inc., gleaned information collected during KKR'sacquisition of Jim Walter Corp., the predecessor to WalterIndustries.  The complaint further alleges that the two used thatinformation to gain a competitive advantage in bids on debtsecurities issued by their former clients.     "As a result," the complaint alleges, "defendants were ableto purchase at a steep discount more than $160 million faceamount of debt securities of the Debtors.  Consistent withBlack's pattern of behavior, defendants have now attempted to usethe position they have acquired in Walter Industries to takecontrol of the organization, by stepping in as controllingshareholders."     Black and Rowan acted as fiduciaries of Walters until itfiled for Chapter 11 in December 1989, and as fiduciaries of KKRinterests until Drexel collapsed in February 1990.  According tothe complaint, during that time, the two allegedly had access toinformation not available to the public, such as hidden values inWalter's $1.1 billion mortgage portfolio and projections aboutWalter's future performance.  The complaint further alleges thatBlack used this information when making his purchase of Walterbonds under the guise of his new firm, Apollo Advisors.     One of those acquisitions, completed in March 1992, was amajor portion of Walter's outstanding debt, $120,445,719 in faceamount of senior subordinated extendible reset notes, $25 millionin face amount of subordinated notes due 1996, $12.375 million inface amount of pre-leveraged buyout debt of Walter and$2.25 million in face amount of series B & C senior extendiblereset notes.     Black has filed one of two plans of reorganization forWalter, his competing with one filed by the debtor.  Both plansprovide for payment in full of all secured claims and allowedamounts of unsecured claims, including unsecured debt and tradecreditor claims.  Both are pending approval by the bankruptcycourt.     "The Apollo Plan constitutes the final step in enabling theApollo Fiduciaries to consummate Black's original strategy toutilize the confidential and proprietary valuable informationobtained from Walter Industries and the KKR Interests to obtaincontrol of Walter Industries and squeeze out the equity interestsof the KKR Interests and management," the complaint alleges.     In this adversary proceeding, the plaintiffs are seekingaffirmative relief for breach of fiduciary duty, misappropriationof confidential business information and conversion.     The complaint was filed by Michael Armstrong of Kirkpatrick& Lockhart in New York City; by Don Stichter of Stichter, Riedel,Blain & Prosser in Tampa; by Leonard Gilbert of Carlton, Fields,Ward, Emmanuel, Smith & Cutler in Tampa; and by Philip Howard ofHoward, Darby, & Levin in New York City.Back to Headline List CopyrightPROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 1994RELIANCE-ON-COUNSEL DEFENSE WAIVES PRIVILEGE, JUDGE RULES     Even if defendant officers and directors do not always waivean attorney-client privilege by generally asserting reliance oncounsel's advice as a general defense against reckless conductcharges, they must produce communications relating to narrowareas where the substance of the documents was injected into thecase through their specific statements of reliance, said afederal judge in Wilmington Aug. 5  (In re ML-Lee AcquisitionFund II, L.P. et al., D DE, No. 92-60).     The suit claimed that ML-Lee Acquisition Fund II L.P. andML-Lee Acquisition Fund (Retirement Accounts) used false andmisleading claims to deceive those who bought limited partnershipinterests in the funds between Nov. 10, 1989, and Jan. 5, 1990.In addition to the federal securities law claims, the suitasserted three causes of action that arise under Delaware law --breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and fraud anddeceit.     In an April 1 opinion, U.S. District Judge Joseph F. Farnanallowed plaintiffs to proceed with a private right of actionunder the Investment Company Act but barred them from bringingaider and abettor charges against the advisors and allies of thecorporate and individual defendants under that statute.     At the same time, the judge denied plaintiffs' motion tocompel the production of certain evidence withheld on the basisof attorney-client privilege.  The court declined to decide thatdefendants waived the privilege simply by stating duringdepositions that they failed to take certain actions based onadvice of counsel, but it cautioned that if it found thatdefendants were using the privilege as a shield to liability orsubsequently raised a reliance-on-counsel defense, the motion tocompel would be granted.     Subsequently, plaintiffs contended that in answering anamended complaint, defendants specifically relied on advice ofcounsel in claiming that they believed in good faith that certaintransactions were well founded.     "A client may waive the privilege by disclosure of someprivileged communication...or by asserting reliance upon theadvice of counsel as an essential element of his defense," thecourt wrote.  Even if defendants are correct that simply denyingallegations of reckless conduct or generally asserting relianceon counsel is not sufficient to waive the attorney-clientprivilege, the court said, "In order for plaintiffs to have afair and adequate opportunity to test and rebut defendants'allegations that they sought advice from counsel, plaintiffs areentitled to know, for example whether the Lee defendantsdisclosed all material facts to counsel, whether counsel gave anotherwise well-informed opinion, [and whether] the Lee defendantsfollow[ed] the advice from counsel."     "Even if the Lee defendants intended only to rely on the actof seeking advice from counsel to show they behaved in goodfaith, plaintiffs are entitled to test the validity and sincerityof that action," the court concluded.     The court noted that the officers and directors specificallystated that they relied on the advice of counsel as to certainlegal definitions, compliance with laws and fulfillment offiduciary duties -- responses which reach beyond simply denyingreckless conduct.     As to the scope of the waiver, Judge Farnan noted thatdefendants' assertions as to their reliance on counsel were veryspecific and very narrow:  "Therefore, the defendants arecompelled to produce only those communications relating to thespecific areas in which defendants have asserted reliance on theadvice of counsel."     Plaintiffs are represented by Pamela Tikellis, Carolyn D.Mack and Cynthia Calder of Chimicles, Burt, Jacobsen & McNew inWilmington; Michael Freed and Carol Gilden of Much, Shelist,Freed, Denenberg & Ament in Chicago; and William French, RobertGegios and Glen Lavy of Gibbs, Roper, Loots & Williams inMilwaukee.

TheGloucester Corporation, et al., D MA, No. 92-11812-REK).     Based on its reading of the Restatement of Torts, the courtconcluded that a jury could find that the accounting firm, "inthe course of its profession, supplied information in the form ofaudit reports to [the borrower], with substantial certainty thatthose reports would be supplied by [the borrower] to and reliedupon by the banks in deciding whether to extend credit to [theborrower]."     Plaintiff banks, Fleet National Bank and CooperatieveCentrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank (collectively, banks) filedsuit against Tonneson & Co. (Tonneson) to recover loan balancesoutstanding when The Gloucester Corporation (TGC) defaulted onmulti-million dollar loans made in reliance on the "faulty"audits and misstatements made by Tonneson.  Prior to the filingof the suit, Tonneson had audited the financial statements of thenow-defunct TGC in 1989 and 1990.     Tonneson argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matterof law because under the tests most frequently applied by courtsboth in and out of Massachusetts for determining whetheraccounting firms owe a duty of care to persons with whom they arenot in privity, Tonneson owed no such duty to the banks.Tonneson contends that the firm itself did not send the auditedfinancial statements to the banks; that the banks neverquestioned Tonneson about the audited statements; and no one evenactually confirmed to Tonneson that the audited financialstatements had in fact been furnished to the banks.     The court first noted that, although neither theMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) nor the MassachusettsAppeals Court has decided the question of whether a CPA owes aduty of care to persons with whom the CPA is not in privity, theSJC had issued a series of opinions involving liability of otherprofessionals to persons with whom they were not in privity.  Thecourt distinguished the roles of professionals such as lawyersand doctors who are retained to provide services solely to thepersons who retained them, and CPAs who are "often engaged toconduct an audit for the purpose of providing information --indeed assurances -- to third parties."     After a review of appropriate Massachusetts cases, the courtoutlined four "guiding principles" for dealing with the issue ofpotential unlimited liability under that state's law:  (1) thedefendant must have been hired to perform a particular task;(2) performance of the task must have been for the benefit of aparticular person known to the defendant; (3) the plaintiff musthave had a reasonable expectation that the defendant wouldperform the task in a manner such that the plaintiff should haveescaped the harm that befell him or her; and (4) the defendantsshould have foreseen that the plaintiff or someone in his or herposition would be harmed in a manner and to the extent that theplaintiff was harmed as a result of the defendant's negligence.     Turning to non-Massachusetts precedent, the court determinedthat three tests were applicable to the instant case:  theforeseeability test, the near-privity test and the Restatementtest.  The court concluded that the SJS would probably not adoptthe foreseeability test, because so few other jurisdictions haveadopted it.   The court reached the same conclusion with respectto the privity or near-privity test, on grounds of policy anduncertainty of application, although the parties informed thecourt that 14 jurisdictions have adopted that test.     Finally, the court observed that the Restatement (Second) ofTorts test, which holds accountants and other professionalsliable for providing false information, justifiably relied uponby others, when substantial harmful consequences are likely toresult, has been accepted by "at least" 19 jurisdictions, and"seems to comport best with the Massachusetts cases that haveaddressed the subject of professional liability in the absence ofprivity."  That is, the Restatement test "limits the ambit ofaccountant liability to an individual or a narrow class andincludes in the definition of 'intent' any consequence that theaccountant is 'substantially certain' will result from his or hernegligent misrepresentation," and thus "approaches the actualknowledge standard of several Massachusetts cases, without addinga linkage requirement that appears wholly foreign toMassachusetts case law," it said.     From a policy perspective, the Restatement test alsoprovides for proportionality, predictability, uniformity andflexibility, said the court.Back to Headline List CopyrightPROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 1994ND GA ENTERS PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR LBO ADVISOR     U.S. District Court Judge G. Ernest Tidwell has enteredpartial summary judgment orders on some of the claims brought byMunford, Inc. against its LBO financial advisor in a 1991$68 million adversary proceeding filed by the company to recovercorporate assets allegedly lost as a result of the 1988 leveragedbuyout of the company (In re Munford, Inc., ND GA Bankr., No. 90-00078SWC; Munford v. Munford, No. 91-6417).     Judge Tidwell adopted the bankruptcy court's findings anddismissed breach of contract/negligence, fraudulent conveyanceand aiding and abetting claims against Shearson Lehman Brothers.     The dispute arose from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Munford,Inc, and the 1989 LBO which preceded it.  The 1991 adversarycomplaint includes claims against a variety of participants inthe LBO, including Shearson, who was retained by Munford, Inc. in1987 to evaluate the company's future.  Shearson concluded that asale of 100% of Munford's common stock would maximize shareholdervalue, and that a leveraged buyout or leveraged recap would notsuccessfully maximize shareholder value.  Shearson also preparedan offering memorandum to solicit potential purchasers for thecompany and, later, an opinion indicating that the price offeredfor Munford stock in the LBO was fair to the company'sshareholders.     Shearson was charged with malpractice, negligence, breach ofcontract and breach of fiduciary duty because the "firm failed tocounsel Munford carefully and completely concerning the financialcondition" of pre-LBO Munford, the value of its assets, thefinancial effects of the LBO on Munford and the anticipatedinsolvency of the company as a consequence of the LBO, thecompany said.     Munford also claimed that the $250,000 in fees paid toShearson were fraudulent conveyances and should be setaside, and that the firm is also guilty of aiding and abetting abreach of fiduciary duty by the company's board of directors.The complaint alleges that Shearson learned of the "continuingdecline of Munford's operations" and that the company would berendered insolvent as a result of the LBO, but assisted thedirectors in consummating the LBO anyway.     In two April 4 opinions, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Cottonrecommended that the separate motions for summary judgment filedby the DFA Entities and certain former Munford officer/directorsbe denied, and that Shearson's motion be granted as to threecounts in the complaint.  Judge Tidwell modified in an Aug. 4order.     First, Judge Tidwell agreed with Judge Cotton that Munford'sclaims of professional negligence, breach of contract, fraudulentconveyance and aiding and abetting against Shearson should bedismissed.  He said that Munford's failure to come forward withexpert testimony on the issue of the standard of care to beexercised by a professional warranted dismissal of the negligenceallegation.  He noted that, while simple negligence claims do notrequire expert testimony, assertions of professional negligencecan be established "only by professional or expert testimony."     The court rejected Munford's contention that it was entitledto rely on testimony by Shearson representatives to establish therelevant standard of care, concluding that the testimony at issuerelated to Shearson's contractual duty to Munford, and did notestablish an opinion about a general standard of care.     With respect to Munford's claim that Shearson aided andabetted the officer/director defendants' alleged breach of dutyto Munford, Judge Tidwell concluded that the bankruptcy courtcorrectly determined that Georgia law does not recognize thattort, and that a Georgia court faced with the issue would not belikely to create such a cause of action.  He observed that, inview of the fact that fiduciary duties "are based on the specialrelationship existing between two or more parties," theimposition of aider and abettor liability for breaches offiduciary duty essentially extends fiduciary obligations beyondthe scope of the confidential or special relationship.Back to Headline List CopyrightPROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 19942ND CIR. REJECTS CHALLENGE TO MERRILL LYNCH FINANCING OFFER     A suit claiming that Merrill Lynch, in connection with itsorchestration of the 1988 LBO of Texas-based Insilco Corporation,participated in the distribution of securities through amaterially misleading prospectus and registration statement isbarred by the statute of limitations, said the Second CircuitU.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 12 (Jackson National Life InsuranceCompany v. Merrill Lynch & Co. Ins. et al., 2nd Cir., No. 93-9287).     The panel concluded that, even if the initial prospectus wasmisleading, the warnings in the prospectus and the subsequentoffering memorandum put the plaintiff on inquiry notice of thefraud more than one year before the tolling date.     Insilco Corporation underwent an LBO in August 1988 and, asa result, took on debt that included approximately $405 millionin "bridge financing" provided by Merrill Lynch to ensure thedeal's success.  The terms of the bridge loan required Insilco toengage in a public offering of high-yield "junk" bonds andwarrants and to use the proceeds to repay the bridge financingprovided by Merrill Lynch.  Plaintiff Jackson National LifeInsurance Company (Jackson) responded to Merrill Lynch'ssolicitation by purchasing nearly $8 million in principal amountof Insilco securities in January 1989.     In May 1990, Insilco embarked upon a recapitalization andfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission an offeringmemorandum which updated the company's financial condition.  Therecap plan failed and Insilco filed for Chapter 11 protection inJanuary 1991.     Jackson filed suit against Merrill Lynch under 11 and 12(2)of the Securities Act of 1933 and 20A of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, alleging three material misstatements or omissions:(1) the prospectus falsely indicated that the January 1989offering was being conducted on an "all or none" basis whenMerrill Lynch knew all the securities could not be sold to thepublic; (2) the prospectus failed to disclose that the "qualifiedindependent underwriter" was not informed that the offering wouldnot be conducted on an "all or none" basis because there was nopublic market for the entire offering; and (3) the prospectusfailed to warn that the LBO had rendered Insilco insolvent beforethe offering took place.     In addition to declaring the suit barred by the statute oflimitations, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District ofNew York also held that Jackson did not state a claim under 20Aof the 1934 Act because it did not plead a predicate violation ofthe 1934 Act as that section requires.     The Second Circuit panel affirmed in an opinion by JudgeJohn Walker.     First, said Judge Walker, the statute of limitationsapplicable to Jackson's 1933 Act claims is one year "after thediscovery of the untrue statement of omission, or after suchdiscovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonablediligence.... [emphasis in the original]."  He concluded thatJackson had at its disposal the facts from which it could havediscovered the misstatement it alleges more than one year beforethe tolling date.     Beginning with Jackson's "all or none" claims, Judge Walkersaid that, among the "early storm warnings" available to alertJackson that the Merrill Lynch offering was not an "all or none"offering was the fact that (1) the prospectus contained noprovisions for escrow accounts and refund arrangements; (2) the1989 Insilco offering was conducted by Merrill Lynch on a "firmcommitment" basis; and (3) the May 1990 offering memorandumcirculated in connection with the recap revealed that MerrillLynch "currently" owned about 50% of the securities offered in1989 and that only a "limited" market for the securities haddeveloped.     The court said that, even if it assumed that the ambiguouslanguage in the prospectus "unmistakably gave the misleadingimpression that the offering was being conducted on an all ornone basis, the aggregate of circumstances in the case wassufficient to put a reasonable investor on notice that theunderwriting was not to be conducted on an all or none basis."     Turning to Jackson's insolvency claim, Judge Walker observedthat the reasonableness of Jackson's reliance on statements ofInsilco's solvency in the prospectus to support its claim that itcould not have known of an imminent bankruptcy "must be assessedagainst the actual language of the prospectus."  The solvencyopinion in the prospectus was contingent on future events,primarily the ability to generate increased operating income,over which Insilco had only limited control, said the court, andwas followed by the statement "no assurance could be given that acourt would confirm the company's position with respect to thesolvency issues."     Judge Walker said additional evidence of potentialinsolvency can be found in the prospectus' financial information,which showed the impact of the LBO on the company's finances anddisclosed that the company's high debt-to-equity ratio resultingfrom the LBO might adversely affect the company's ability to meetprincipal and interest payments as they came due.  In addition,the offering memorandum 16 months later revealed that Insilco wasexperiencing severe cash flow problems which might render itunable to meet its current liabilities, the court said.     Finally, Judge Walker addressed Jackson's claim under 20A,which has a five-year statute of limitations, and rejectedJackson's contention that it should be allowed to proceed under20A for violations of 11 and 12(2) of the 1933 Act becauseremedies of the 1933 and 1934 Acts were "meant to be cumulative,not exclusive."  The court said that the language of Section 20Amakes it clear that "Congress sought to alter the remediesavailable in insider trading cases and only in insider tradingcases [emphasis in the original]."     Jackson was represented by Raymond Levites, Richard Cashmanand Diane Britton of Pavelic & Levites.  Counsel for MerrillLynch were Jack Auspitz, Debra Freeman and Claire Silberman ofMorrison & Foerster.

HOLDS CLAIMS AGAINST CONSULTANT NOT RELATED TO ERISA     A panel of the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals heldJune 30 that the state law claims of trustees of an ERISA-governed plan against a negligent outside consultant were notpreempted because none of the claims related closely enough tothe plan  (Airparts Company, Inc. et al. v. Custom BenefitServices of Austin, Inc., 10th Cir., No. 93-3268).     The decision reversed and remanded a ruling by the U.S.District Court for the District of Kansas which dismissed thecomplaint brought by Airparts Company, Inc. against defendantCustom Benefit Services of Austin, Inc., d/b/a First ActuarialCorp. (FAC), on the grounds that their state law claims werepreempted by ERISA.     The plaintiffs, co-trustees of an ERISA-governed plan,brought state law claims of negligence, implied indemnity andcommon law fraud against FAC, a firm hired by the plaintiffs toprovide expert benefit plan consultation.  Specifically, theplaintiffs alleged that FAC failed to give timely advice toAirparts on the effects of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1987, improperly calculated pension benefits, proposed anddrafted a useless plan amendment and deliberately concealed thecost of the amendment and its eventual uselessness from theplaintiffs.     In an opinion delivered by Judge Oliver Seth, the panel heldthat the state law claims put forth by Airparts did not relate toan ERISA plan and therefore were not preempted.  The state lawsinvolved in the case, the panel said, did not regulate the typeof benefits or terms of the plan; they did not create reporting,disclosure, funding or vesting requirements for the plan; theydid not affect the calculation of benefits; and they were notcommon law rules designed to rectify faulty plan administration.     "Plaintiffs' state law claims against FAC do not have andwill not have any effect whatsoever on the relations among thetraditional plan entities," the panel said.  "Those principals,the employer, the plan, the plan fiduciaries, and thebeneficiaries, are united in their efforts to secure redress fromdefendants.  A recovery from defendants will increase the coffersof the plan; a defeat will mean that the plan has expended moneyin fruitless litigation.  Such a tangential effect, however, isnot enough to relate these state law claims to the plan itself."     Continuing, the panel held that Airparts' claims would notaffect the structure, administration or the type of benefitsprovided by the ERISA-governed plan.  In addition, the panelnoted that the plaintiffs made no claim based on any rights underthe plan and there was no allegation that any of the plan's termshad been breached.  Also, there was no effort to enforce ormodify the terms of the plan and there was no threat that, byallowing the suit to go forward, conflicting regulations wouldemerge which would destroy the structural unity of the ERISAscheme.     Moreover, the panel said that the plan administrator in thiscase was Airparts, not FAC.  FAC was simply an outside consultantwhich did not directly perform any administrative act vis-a-visthe plan, it said.  Addressing congressional purpose in enactingERISA, the panel said that it saw "no congressional purpose to befurthered by denying an ERISA plan a state cause of actionagainst allegedly negligent third-party service providers."

Western Airlines Inc., DE Sup. Ct., No. 94-94).     Frederick Rand, seeking to represent other shareholders ofWestern Airlines, challenged the price at which the airline wasacquired by Delta.  The suit alleged that due to their corporatepositions, the individual defendants had information -- whichthey allegedly withheld from the class -- that would indicatethat Western was worth substantially more than the preshare priceoffered, especially considering its synergy value.     Rand charged that the Western board breached its duty ofcare by allegedly agreeing to a stock option pact with Delta aswell as a no-shop and no-talk pact as part of the mergeragreement.  He claimed that in return for lucrative goldenparachutes, Western's board violated its Revlon duty to seek thebest value for shareholders once it became apparent that thecompany would change hands.  The suit alleged that the board didnot even seek an opinion from an independent adviser on thefairness of the Delta offer.     In a Sept. 11, 1989, opinion, Vice Chancellor Carolyn Bergerdismissed Delta but found that two claims against Western'sdirectors and officers could not be resolved on a motion todismiss:  (1) the Revlon claim that the board failed to auctionthe company; and (2) a disclosure claim that the directorsviolated their duty of complete candor by withholding informationon the true value of the company.               On defendants' motion for summary judgment, the vicechancellor, in a Feb. 25 opinion, found reason to dismiss thoseclaims.  Although an "enhanced scrutiny" standard must be appliedhere, "the essential question remains whether a disinterestedboard has satisfied its duty to act on a fully informed basis,"the court stated.  Nor was the existence of golden parachuteprovisions for three of Western's chief negotiators enough toquestion their independence, the court said.     In their opening brief, Rand said that, contrary to the law,the lower court had, on a motion for summary judgment, "refusedto draw a single inference in plaintiffs' favor."  For instance,as to duty of loyalty, appellants argued:  "A director is notindependent if he can reasonably anticipate special benefitsflowing from the transaction submitted to the board for itsapproval,...[but the chancery court] improperly overlaid anadditional element in determining the existence of dividedloyalty."     In reply, Western contended that the chancery court hadproperly held that the Western board satisfied its Revlon dutiesin approving the merger agreement by (1) canvassing the marketand contacting virtually every airline about the possibility of amerger, acquisition, or joint marketing agreement;(2) considering the severe disadvantages it faced in a newly regulatedmarket; and (3) considering the extensive work performed by fincancialadvisor Dillon Reed.    Since Delta was the only offer to come forward after a 15-monthsearch, Western contended, the court properly concluded that the priceWestern's board obtained was only not fair but the highest pricepossible.    In their reply brief, plaintiffs argued that at the very least,they have shown that there is a question of material fact that wouldpreclude summary judgment as to both duty of care and loyalty charges.Both the chancery court and defendants miss the pointpoint in pointing to the fact that Dillon Reed did not have toback the disputed merger to get its bonus, they said.  "Dillonwas highly motivated to recommend a transaction rather thansuggest that Western continue as an ongoing enterprise,"plaintiffs said, and, since time was running out, the contesteddeal was the only practical way to get that money.     Defendants' contention that a previous higher offer wassubject to conditions and thus not material is unsupported byauthority and flies in the face of common knowledge that mostsuch offers are at the outset subject to numerous conditions,appellants argued in support of their assertion that the boarddid not pursue alternatives.  Nor can it be concluded summarilythat Western gained a substantial benefit that justified thelock-up and no-shop provisions, appellants said.     "Defendants do not deny the financial interest of Western'snegotiators," appellants asserted.  "Rather they seem to say thatsuch a conflict is permissible so long as the financiallyconflicted party did not initiate the set of circumstancesleading to the conflict.  To the contrary, it is cut and driedthat a director who receives a substantial benefit fromsupporting a transaction cannot be objectively viewed asdisinterested or independent.  The Chancery Court recognized thatconflict but disregarded its importance."     Even if none of these elements are a litmus test for breachof duty, they create, at the very least, a question that can onlybe decided at trial, appellants said.     Plaintiffs are represented by Joseph Rosenthal and KevinGross of Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess in Wilmington, DE;and by Roger Kirby of Kaufman, Malchman, Kirby & Squire in NewYork City.

Investors Associates, Inc., et al., 11th Cir.,No. 93-5049).     The panel said that the defendants did not qualify as third-party beneficiaries because an intent to benefit them was notapparent from the construction of the arbitration agreement "inlight of all surrounding circumstances."     According to court documents, co-defendant MitchellGoldberg, as agent for co-defendant Investors Associates, Inc.(IAI), solicited plaintiff Don Taylor to buy and sell stock fromIAI.  On Jan. 6, 1992, Taylor purchased stock through IAI and,the next day, signed a client's agreement with Prudential-BacheSecurities, which was to serve as clearing broker in the tradingarrangement.     Taylor subsequently filed suit against IAI and Goldberg,alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934; Rule 10(b)(5); Section 12(2) of the Securities Actof 1933; Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO); Texas Blue Sky Law; Texas Business and Commerce Code andthe Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act.  The defendantsmoved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration or dismiss theaction.     The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texasconcluded that the defendants could not compel arbitration, andthe appeals court panel affirmed in a per curiam opinion, whichadopted the trial court's decision.     In his opinion below, U.S. District Judge William Justicefirst noted that the arbitration clause did not mention IAI orGoldberg by name or function, nor did those parties sign thedocument.  Judge Justice rejected the defendants' contention thatthey were included as parties to the pact through the use of"you" (referring to Prudential) in the client's agreement,because IAI allegedly supplied Taylor with the agreement.     Second, Judge Justice said that the intent of the parties tothe arbitration agreement was manifest -- to arbitrate claims byor against the clearing house concerning its handling of Taylor'saccount.  In addition, a letter from Prudential, explaining thatit was not Taylor's broker, but his broker's clearing firm, makesit clear that the defendants were independent from Prudential,said the judge.     Third, the defendants cannot rely on agency principles tosupport their argument that they are entitled to enforce thearbitration agreement, said the court.  Unlike the factsituations in the cases cited by the defendants, here, thedisputed transaction did not involve the liquidation of stockwhereby the clearing house's services were employed, which mightmake the clearing house a party to the suit, Judge Justice noted.No claims in the suit pertain to Prudential's or Taylor'saccounts there, he said, and, hence, there was no contingentright for the introducing broker to invoke the arbitrationagreement.     Finally, with respect to the defendants' third-partybeneficiary argument, the defendants are not mentioned in thearbitration agreement, and no consent to arbitration withGoldberg or IAI may be implied based solely on the relationshipbetween the introducing broker and the clearing house, said thecourt.Back to Headline List CopyrightPROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 19942ND CIR. REVERSES FINDING FOR CARRIER ON PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY     The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 8 by a 2-1margin overturned a summary judgment for an insurer on thecoverage demands of a lawyer policyholder, finding that thepolicy language of the professional liability policy in issuethat disclaims coverage "for the return of or restitution oflegal fees, costs and expenses" is ambiguous with respect toclaims involving fees paid to third parties (McCostis v. HomeInsurance Co. of Indiana, 2nd Cir., No. 93-9283).               The insured, Richard M. McCostis, was a partner in the firmof McCostis & Lind and also served as director, secretary andoutside general counsel of Barr Laboratories.  In September 1990,Barr became a client of the law firm of Winston & Strawn.     Winston & Strawn subsequently named McCostis and ex-W&Spartner Lawrence Fox to a lawsuit that alleged that the twoattorneys conspired to overbill Barr for upwards of $756,000.  Ofthis amount, McCostis allegedly pocketed $335,000 and Foxreceived the balance.  W&S' suit against the lawyers was groundedin RICO, common law fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.  W&Sreimbursed Barr for its loss and received an assignment of rightsas against McCostis and Fox.     McCostis tendered the claim to his professional liabilitycarrier, Home Insurance Co. of Indiana.  Home initially assumedthe defense, but disclaimed coverage based on the policydefinition of damages which specifically excluded claims "for thereturn of or restitution of legal fees, costs and expenses."     McCostis lodged a declaratory judgment suit in the SouthernDistrict of New York.  The trial court granted summary judgmentto the carrier, determining that the suit against McCostis wasessentially for the return of legal fees and expenses.     McCostis argued on appeal that since the complaint allegedthat he only received $335,000, but seeks to recover the fullamount embezzled, Winston & Strawn are seeking some element ofdamages as well as the return of the funds.  The insured alsoargued that the policy also specifically covers claims fornegligent breach of fiduciary duty.     In reversing, the Second Circuit found that the policylanguage did "not provide a clear answer to the question ofwhether the return or restitution of legal fees exclusion wouldbe applicable for disputes concerning fees paid to thirdparties."  The panel wrote that "the use of the words 'return'and 'restitution' seems to indicate that the exclusion wouldpertain only to situations where the insured received thedisputed funds and is forced to repay the monies to the client."     The panel vacated and remanded with instructions to theSouthern District to consider extrinsic evidence (if any) thatwould demonstrate the actual intent of the parties.     U.S. Circuit Judge George C. Pratt authored the majorityopinion, in which U.S. Circuit Judge John M. Walker Jr. joined.Senior U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley of the SouthernDistrict of New York, sitting by designation, issued a one-linedissent.     Michael F.

Hoiby etal., No. 93-CV-71397-DT).     Allstate Car Leasing Corporation was sued in state courtautomobile negligence litigation after a 1979 accident.  Allstatewas insured under a $250,000 liability policy issued by plaintiffPreferred.  Preferred retained the defendant lawyers, EugeneHoiby and Robert Kanter, to represent the Allstate.  After twotrials, the case was settled when Preferred paid $1.3 million.     Before the settlement, Allstate had sued Preferred and thelawyers, alleging bad faith by the insurer and professionalnegligence by the lawyers, including failure of the lawyers tokeep it fully informed, failure to solicit a settlement andnegligently directing the defense of the underlying tortlitigation.  After the $1.3 million settlement was reached, theowner stipulated to dismissal of its malpractice and bad faithcomplaint with prejudice.     However, Preferred then filed a diversity-based legalmalpractice complaint in the Eastern District of Michigan.  Thelawyers moved for summary judgment.     Judge George E. Woods granted the defense motion.     In general, an insurer may use the doctrine of equitablesubrogation -- rather than rely on a direct attorney-clientrelationship -- to pursue a malpractice claim against lawyers itretained for its policyholder, he said.  Because subrogationgives the insurer only rights owed to the policyholder, defensecounsel's loyalties are not compromised by the equitablesubrogation approach, he said.     In this case, however, the policyholder already had agreedto dismiss its own malpractice claim with prejudice, andPreferred had consented to that dismissal with a purportedreservation of its own rights.  Woods found that purportedreservation of rights to be ineffective, though; Preferred, as asubrogee, cannot maintain the malpractice claim that itspolicyholder already had relinquished.Back to Headline List CopyrightPROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetSeptember 1994WD MI: MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS VOID MALPRACTICE POLICY     Whether a psychologist's purportedly materialmisrepresentations in an application and renewal application fora professional liability policy void the policies ab initio canbe resolved in a federal declaratory judgment action, a judge inGrand Rapids, MI, has ruled.  A single decision on whether thereis an insurance contract under which the psychologist can demanddefense and indemnification for sexual assault and related claimswill resolve the issue for a number of active and prospectivestate tort suits, according to the July 15 decision  (ChicagoInsurance Co. v. Regt et al., WD MI, No. :93-CV-764).     Chicago Insurance Co. issued malpractice policies to John M.Regt, Ph.D., for 1991 and 1992.  In 1993, the interveningcodefendants filed state court complaints alleging sexual abuse,negligence and breach of the policyholder's professional standardof care.  The policyholder filed for bankruptcy.     The insurer then filed a diversity-based declaratoryjudgment complaint in the Western District of Michigan, allegingthat the misrepresentations made the policies invalid andunenforceable.  The intervening codefendants in turn filed statecourt declaratory judgment complaints against the plaintiff andanother insurer that is not a party to the federal action.     The intervening codefendants moved for summary judgment ordismissal of the federal action on the pleadings, citing thepending state court litigation.     U.S. Judge Robert Holmes Bell denied the motion, ruling thata federal judgment would clarify and settle the legal relationsbetween the insurer and its policyholder and would afford relieffrom the uncertainty, insecurity and controversy giving rise tothe proceeding.     A declaratory judgment would settle the controversy withoutrequiring any evidence about the policyholder's allegedprofessional misconduct and negligence that are at the core ofthe state litigation, Bell ruled.  It would apply both to thepending suits and any future tort actions against thepolicyholder, he said.  The judgment also would clarify theinsurer's obligations, the court wrote.     Judge Bell found no evidence that the insurer had initiatedthe declaratory judgment action for procedural fencing or toprovide an arena for res judicata.  Nor would a declaratoryjudgment increase friction between state and federal courtsbecause a decision on coverage would not depend on a factualrecord in the underlying tort litigation, he said.     Although the state court could decide the issue, the issuesin the tort actions are different, he said, and a resolution ofinsurance coverage does not depend on or have any legal affect ona state court declaratory action against another insurer.Because there is no duplication of factual or legal issues, astate court would not necessarily present a better or moreeffective remedy, he said.Back to Headline List WT03-B08-8IA087-000634-B047-160http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/mt23.html 205.156.212.5 19970122033449 text/html 13374HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:32:57 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:36 GMTContent-length: 13187Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/mt23.html Sample Issue Copyright ADA UPDATE via NewsNet January 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES HEALTH INSURANCE - AIDS COVERAGE EEOC Settlement: Mason Tenders District Council Welfare Fund (265 words) APPLYING FOR EMPLOYMENT Kemer v Johnson, USDC SDNY, 93-Civ, 6965 (245 words) PARKING FOR DISABLED WORKERS Lyons v Legal Aid Society, CA2, 95-7030 (294 words) HEALTH INSURANCE GUIDELINES Federal Register, 60 FR 60720 (66 words) ADA IN DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS Mohamed v Marriott International, DC SDNY, 94 Civ 2336 (588 words) MODIFYING JOB DUTIES Kuehl v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., DC Colo 95-S-393 (237 words) CopyrightADA UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996HEALTH INSURANCE - AIDS COVERAGEEEOC Settlement: Mason Tenders District Council Welfare FundEEOC has announced that it has negotiated a $1 million settlementof its complaint against the Mason Tenders District CouncilWelfare Fund, a union-administered health insurance plan.The Fund's plan, which covered more than 10,000 workers and theirfamilies, specifically excluded health insurance coverage forillnesses related to AIDS and HIV infections.EEOC had filed claims contending that the exclusion violated theAmericans With Disabilities Act on behalf of a number of unionmembers who were denied health insurance coverage for AIDS andHIV-related medical problems.Mason Tenders had argued that as a self-administered, self-fundedhealth insurance plan, it was not subject to ADA. Its claims wererejected by a federal district court, which held that ADAapplied. Rather than litigate the issue further, Mason Tenderselected to settle the case with EEOC.In response to Mason Tenders claim that "it had to limit AIDSbenefits because of losses from huge health care bills," EEOCsaid that limitations on benefits are permitted where theemployer demonstrates that there were actuarial reasons fortreating classes of employees differently. Here, however, EEOCattorney James Lee said that Mason Tenders was "paying for everyother high-priced condition" but was excluding AIDS and HIV-related medical expenses.EDITOR'S NOTE: In McGann v H&H Music Company, 946 F2d 401, theU.S. Supreme Court ruled that an employer's self-insured healthplan that limited benefits paid for AIDS and HIV-related medicalexpenses did not violate the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

Not if the applicant fails to inform the employer ofhis or her disability, according to the federal district courtdecision in Kemer v Johnson.The Court decided that Eric N. Kemer, an applicant foremployment with the General Services Administration (GSA), didnot make a prima facie case that he was "otherwise qualified" forthe position because he failed to complete his application form.The Court held that "filing an application is an essentialprerequisite for any position [with GSA]."GSA had told Kemer that his application was incomplete. It hadsent him another employment application form, inviting him toproperly complete it and resubmit it to the agency. The Courtsaid this constituted a reasonable accommodation.Kemer represented himself as having a "depressive neurosis and aschizotypical personality disorder." He contended that GSA shouldhave accommodated his disability by providing him with assistancein completing the application form.The Court noted that people with such mental conditions areentitled to protection under the Rehabilitation Act. But, theCourt said, "employers are only required to make reasonableaccommodation to the known mental and physical limitations of aqualified applicant." Kemer never notified GSA of his disability.Also, Kemer offered no evidence that his disability interferedwith his ability to successfully complete the employmentapplication form.Back to Headline List CopyrightADA UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996PARKING FOR DISABLED WORKERSLyons v Legal Aid Society, CA2, 95-7030An employer may be required to provide a disabled employee with aparking space as a reasonable accommodation or be in violation ofthe Americans With Disabilities Act, according to a ruling by theU.S. Circuit Court of Appeal, Second Circuit [NY].Legal Aid Society attorney Beth Lyons charged the Society withviolating ADA when it rejected her request for a paid parkingspace. Lyons said that she needed a parking space near her officebecause her ability to walk had been seriously impaired by a caraccident. Paying for parking, according to Lyons, cost her about20% of her salary - approximately $400 a month.Although a federal district court judge dismissed her claim asbeing outside the scope of ADA, the Second Circuit Court ofAppeals reinstated it.The Court said that "an essential aspect of many jobs is theability to appear at work regularly and on time." Accordingly,providing a parking space may constitute a "reasonableaccommodation" required by ADA under certain circumstances.In the Circuit Court's view, "there is nothing unreasonable [interms of legislative intent] in requiring an employer to furnishan otherwise qualified disabled employee with assistance relatedto her ability to get to work."In response to the Society's argument that parking and otherforms of "commuting assistance" were not provided to otheremployees, the Circuit said that "Congress envisioned thatemployer assistance with transportation to get the employee toand from the job might be covered" and EEOC guidelinesspecifically mention "reserved parking spaces" as a reasonableaccommodation.The Circuit Court remanded the matter to the district court withthe observation that "Legal Aid may be able to develop evidenceprior to trial showing that [Lyons'] request is unreasonable."Back to Headline List CopyrightADA UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996HEALTH INSURANCE GUIDELINESFederal Register, 60 FR 60720The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has announced that itwill publish proposed guidelines concerning the Americans WithDisabilities Act's impact on health insurance.

In addition,  the decision stronglyimplies that ADA's reasonable accommodation mandates requires theemployer to provide a sign interpreter at other meetings that adeaf worker attends, including meetings involving an evaluationof his or her work performance.Ahmed Mohamed, a deaf person, performed maintenance work forMarriott Marquis Hotel's engineering department. A native ofEgypt, Mohamed  communicated in American Sign Language althoughhe had a limited ability to read and write English.Mohamed found a coworkers handbag containing $480. AlthoughMarriott policy required employees who found money to turn itover to a guard, Mohamed put the money in his locker.The loss was discovered and Mohamed was immediately interviewedby three members of Marriott management concerning the money. Onemanager had some minimal training in sign language, but it provedinsufficient for the occasion. After more than an hour themeeting was terminated. Mohamed was advised that a second meetingat which an sign interpreter would be present would be scheduled.At the second meeting, at which the interpreter was present,Mohamed related the same story that he had earlier attempted tocommunicate -- he could not find his supervisor and therefore heplaced the money in his locker. Marriott terminated Mohamedbecause he failed to follow Marriott's policy of turning moneyfound in the hotel to a guard.Mohamed sued, claiming (1) the absence of an interpreter at thefirst meeting violated ADA's requirement that employer's providedisabled workers with a reasonable accommodation and (2)disparate treatment in that he was terminated because of hisdeafness.Marriott, on the other hand, argued that regardless of anydisability, Mohamed would have been dismissed because he violatedhotel policy.The Court rejected Marriott's claim that providing an interpreterat the second meeting met ADA's reasonable accommodationrequirement on the grounds that the lack of an interpreter at thefirst meeting "set a tone of mistrust of Mohamed that inalterablyled to his discharge." This, said the Court, warranted a trial todetermine whether providing an interpreter at the second meetingwas sufficient to satisfy ADA's reasonable accommodationrequirements.According to the ruling, the need for the accommodation arose notin the course of the termination per se, but "in the course of ameeting with an employee to review the disappearance of somethingof value."As to ADA's requirement that employer provide workers with areasonable accommodation, the Court said that "the fact that themeeting eventually led to termination makes it no less an elementof Mohamed's job performance than a staff meeting, a performanceevaluation or a salary review," indicating that a signinterpreter would be required at those meetings as well.Nevertheless, the Court, dismissed Mohamed's claim based ondisparate treatment, finding that Marriott's decision to fire him"did not result from his deafness." On this point the decisionstates:Although Mohamed's discharge may have ... resulted from hisdeafness, Marriott's decision to discharge him was not motivatedby his deafness. It is true that a hearing person would not havefound himself in the same predicament as Mohamed. It is not true,however, that Marriott's decision to fire Mohamed was based onhis deafness. In other words, Marriott's firing Mohamed based onhis actions [handling the money] were not a pretext fordischarging him because he was deaf.Back to Headline List CopyrightADA UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996MODIFYING JOB DUTIESKuehl v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., DC Colo 95-S-393Vicke Kuehl was employed as a "greeter" by Sam's Wholesale Club,a Wal-Mart store.

Whileshe was being treated for the condition Wal-Mart reduced her workhours and allowed her breaks every two hours. When she returnedto work, Kuehl asked to be allowed to sit on a stool while onduty as a greeter. Wal-Mart refused to allow Kuehl to use astool, but offered her the opportunity to work a split-shift orworking as a cashier.Kuehl sued, contending that Wal-Mart violated ADA by refusing toaccommodate her request to use a stool while working as agreeter.A federal district court judge granted Wal-Mart's motion forsummary judgment. The Court ruled that Kuehl's impairment was notsevere enough to constitute a disability since it limited onlyher ability to perform one particular job -- door greeter.However, even if Kuehl was disabled within the meaning of ADA shewould have lost. The Court said that Wal-Mart had shown thatstanding was an essential part of a greeter's job and that it hadreasonably accommodated Kuehl by offering her alternativeemployment.

These powers allow the agency to awardretroactive seniority to persons found to have been victims ofunlawful discrimination, notwithstanding provisions in theState's Civil Service Law to the contrary.The case involved the treatment of women in the New York CityPolice Department. The New York City Human Rights Commission hadfound that the Department had "engaged in a pattern of unlawfuldiscrimination against women."Unlawful acts by the Department included (1) establishingemployment quotas that limited the number of women who could beappointed to less than 2 percent of the police force; (2)discriminatory layoff policies that resulted in more than halfthe women being laid off during a financial crisis in 1976 whileonly 10 percent of the male police officers were laid off; (3)mandatory assignment of women police officers as matrons; and (4)restricting the number of precincts to which women could beassigned.The Human Rights Commission awarded 43 complainants retroactiveseniority for pension and other purposes, together with $533,000collectively in compensatory damages for mental anguish.Complaints filed by an additional 38 active and formerpolicewomen are pending before the Commission.The Court said that the Legislature had granted broad remedialpowers to state and municipal human rights agencies to counteractthe impact of past discrimination in employment. According, theCourt ruled that "under these circumstances [there is] no doubtthat a resolution which may somewhat subordinate the discretionof the appointing authority to the complainants' rights toremediation for the discriminatory practices of that authority ismore consistent with legislative intent."Upholding the authority of the Division to award retroactiveseniority as redress for unlawful discrimination, the Courtdistinguished this remedy from the limitations place on theDivision's directing the appointment of an individual.  The Courtof Appeals referred to its decision in City of Schenectady vState Div. of Human Rights, 37 NY2d 42l.In the Schenectady case the Court ruled that allowing theDivision to order the appointment of an otherwise qualifiedindividual would impinge on the discretion of the statutoryauthority appointing authority to make an appointment, citing Section 61of the Civil Service Law.

According to sponsors, TheEmployment Non-Discrimination Act of 1995 (ENDA)  is intended toensure fair employment practices -- not special rights -- forlesbians, gay men and bisexuals. According to Sen. Ted Kennedy(D-Mass.), one of 150 co-sponsors, it is now legal in 42 statesto fire someone based on sexual orientation.Under ENDA, covered entities cannot subject an individual todifferent standards or treatment based on that individual'ssexual orientation, or discriminate against an individual basedon the sexual orientation of those with whom the individualassociates.EDITOR'S NOTE: The `disparate impact' claim available under TitleVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) is not availableunder ENDA. Therefore, an employer is not required to justify aneutral practice that may have a statistically disparate impactbased on sexual orientation.ENDA does not apply to employers with fewer than fifteenemployees. It also exempts religious organizations, educationalinstitutions substantially controlled or supported by religiousorganizations, and the military.ENDA prohibits preferential treatment, including quotas, based onsexual orientation. It does not require an employer to providebenefits for the same-sex partner of an employee.EDITOR'S NOTE: ENDA provides for the same remedies (injunctiverelief and damages) as are permitted under TitleVII and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).The act applies to Congress, with the same remedies as providedby the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. ENDA would notbe retroactive.For full text of the bill and comments that have appeared in theCongressional Record, see the affirmative action page on NYPER'shome page.

Tiffany offered Quarantino a lowerlevel position, which she accepted. By accepting the lower levelposition, however, Quarantino lost salary, stock options andretirement credits.After filing a complaint with EEOC, Quarantino learned thatTiffany had hired a "non-pregnant, unmarried woman" to performwhat she claims were essentially the same duties that she hadperformed in her former position. She sued, claiming thatTiffany's action constituted unlawful pregnancy discriminationunder Title VII.Quarantino also alleged that although a superior, Michael Eiring,advised that "her job would be waiting for her" when she wasready to return to work, he also told her that "a mother shouldstay home with her child." In addition, Quarantino said that shelearned that Tiffany commenced recruiting for the new positionbefore she left on maternity leave. She also contended that twoother women had experience work problems when they returned fromtheir maternity leaves.A District Court judge ruled that Quarantino had not establisheda prima facie case of unlawful discrimination and dismissed herclaim. The Circuit Court of Appeals [Second Circuit] reverse. Inreinstating her complaint, the Circuit Court said that a trialwas required because Quarantino raised a number of disputedissues, such as the question of the "new position" created beingthe equivalent of her former position and the selection of asingle woman to fill it.The Court suggested that if Quarantino could prove such to be thecase, it might constitute evidence of Tiffany's alleged"discriminatory animus" towards pregnant employees.

Rourke, a Mohawk Indian, was fired from his positionas a correction officer because he refused to cut his hair toconform to department rules concerning hair length which requiredhair to be not more than one-half inch below the top of theirshirt collar.Rourke, who was initially appointed as a prison guard in 1989,stopped cutting his hair in 1991 when he joined the Mohawk'straditional Longhouse faith. He said that he discontinued thepractice of haircuts as a sign of his spirituality and religiouscommitment.Initially allowed to wear his uncut hair in a ponytail, a newsuperior officer directed Rourke to confirm to the Department'shair length policy. Although women corrections personnel may havehair of any length and are allowed to "pin it up" during workinghours, Rourke's offer to do this was rejected. Ultimately he wasdismissed for refusing to obey an order to comply with the hairlength policy.Rourke sued in State Court and won reinstatement. Unemployed fortwo years before being reinstated, Rourke sued in federal courtto obtain punitive or compensatory damages for emotional trauma,a remedy not available in his State action. The federal districtCourt, noting that New York State's Appellate Division hadearlier decided that the State failed to demonstrate any"legitimate state interest that would be advanced" byaccommodating Rourke's request to be exempted from theDepartment's hair length policy, found the Department's actionviolated Title VII and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of1993.The district court's ruling specifically notes that the AppellateDivision already concluded that "the State had no legitimateinterest ... since the very language of the [policy] provides foran alternative to wearing hair beyond one-half inch below thecollar for female correction officers...."Back to Headline List CopyrightAFFIRMATIVE ACTION/EEO PERSONNEL UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996FORMER EMPLOYEES AND TITLE VIIRobinson v Shell Oil Co., CA4, 93-1562The term "employee" in Section 704(a) of Title VII has been held toinclude a former employee who files Title VII allegations that heor she was subjected to unlawful discrimination while anemployee. Section 704(a) also makes it unlawful for an employer toretaliate against an employee because he or she filed chargesalleging unlawful discrimination or assisted others in filing acomplaint claiming Title VII violations. A former employee,however, may not be able to bring a Title VII action based onallegations of retaliatory actions by his or her former employerin some circumstances.In Robinson v Shell Oil Co., a U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsaffirmed a district court's dismissal of a Title VII actioncharging that Shell Oil had given a former employee a "badreference" in retaliation for his filing a Title VII complaintagainst Shell. Robinson, claiming that Shell had fired himbecause of his race, filed a Title VII complaint. Robinson thenapplied for a job with another company while his charges againstShell were still pending.Robinson's prospective employer contacted Shell for a reference.When Robinson didn't get the job he applied for, he filed acomplaint contending that Shell had given him a negativereference in retaliation for his having filed Title VII chargesagainst the company.The Court decided that Title VII's definition of "employee"  doesnot include former employees where the charges of allegeddiscriminatory actions, including alleged retaliation, involvedevents that occurred after the individual stopped working for theformer employer.Back to Headline List CopyrightAFFIRMATIVE ACTION/EEO PERSONNEL UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996AGE DISCRIMINATIONFitzpatrick v Town of Huntington, USDC, EDNY, Civ 93-2670Joseph Fitzpatrick sued the Town of Huntington, N.Y. contendingthat it had unlawfully discriminated against him because of hisage.

Nearly allemployer-directed cases of violence begin with a verbal orphysical threat--threats that a well-structured "threat-management" policy should be able to avert.Start by putting together a multidisciplinary threat-managementteam, says Dennis Johnson, president of Behavior Analysts &Consultants, Inc., of Stuart, Fla., which conducts corporatetraining on managing workplace violence. "Include people whoare trained in workplace violence issues and know the dynamicsof threat management and intervention." A representative teamcould include professionals from the security, safety, humanresources, legal, labor relations and medical functions.The team may also include outside psychologists, consultants,facilities specialists, or public relations and employee assistanceprofessionals. This group is responsible for assessing andmanaging workplace threats and developing general policy andprocedures.Most threat-management teams will want to appoint a groupleader, preferably someone with a history of dealing with threatsand security vulnerability. Often the group leader is the securitymanager or a human resource expert, says Johnson, coauthor ofBreaking Point: The Workplace Violence Epidemic and What toDo About It (National Safe Workplace Institute).Threat management involves two types of assessments--a needsassessment and a behavioral assessment. The team must beprepared to evaluate and manage security threats for both. Theneeds assessment includes a survey of all physical facilities,security systems, access authorization programs and any existingpolicies relating to security issues."You want to assess security vulnerability in terms of thecorporate assets you're looking to protect, past security incidentsand the prevailing environment and social conditions in yourparticular industry and community," says Johnson.For example, "an industry in a high-crime area with lots ofneighborhood violence will affect the attitudes of your workers,"Johnson says. "Given your labor pool, some employees maybelieve that violence is a legitimate form of expressing workplacefrustration."Significant downsizing also increases your vulnerability. In astudy of 125 workplace homicides, Johnson's firm found that halfof the perpetrators had recently been laid off or terminated in adownsizing effort."Because the lives of so many people--especially men--aregrounded in their jobs, the possibility of losing that anchor in aneconomy in which replacement jobs are scarce createsunbearable stress. That stress may manifest itself in violentbehavior," Johnson says.Once the critical risk factors are identified, the team shouldestablish links with outside support functions, such as hospitals,law enforcement and EAP counselors.Basically, the needs assessment helps you determine thereadiness of key players to react effectively to specific situations.For example, asks Johnson "If your beeper goes off, and youlearn that there's a single male perpetrator with multiplehandguns holding your office manager hostage, are you preparedto handle it? Do you have a plan in place?"BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENTThe behavioral assessment looks at actual incidents or scenariosof threatening behavior and at the perpetrators themselves. Itevaluates the potential "triggers" that could turn a manageablethreat into violent aggression.At this stage, the threat-management team  should determinethe circumstances of an incident; whether previous incidentshave occurred; whether the action reflects a pattern; andwhether the person has incurred particular stresses recently(such as a divorce, a layoff, a death in the family)."Whenever a person engages in violent behavior, he or she haschosen aggression over other alternatives," Johnson notes. Tounderstand what led to that choice, the violence should beconsidered in terms of the contributing factors.In framing the specific threat-management policy, the groupmust determine the extent to which supervisors and employeeswill receive training in such areas as conflict resolution, stressmanagement, employee counseling, dealing with difficult people,etc."Many companies believe that controlling workplace violence iseveryone's responsibility and thus choose to extend awarenesstraining to all employees," Johnson says.Johnson suggests combining threat management with otherpolicies, such as Fitness for Duty or Drug-Free Workplacestatements. Johnson favors a catchall "Fair Treatment forOthers" policy, because it can address the importance ofrespecting differences in religious, philosophical or personalbeliefs--any of which may trigger aggression.Without exception, every policy must clearly establish a zerotolerance for threatening behaviors, and Johnson emphasizesthat it be conveyed in both writing and in practice. "It doesn'tmatter if it's a verbalized threat, an emotional outburst,unwanted romantic overtures or physical intimidation. Anyconduct that has the potential to harm or interfere with theactions of others should be investigated."Why? Because beyond an actual threat is the perception of whatthe company considers threatening. If employees witness andreport threatening behavior, but management takes no action tostop it, "people may start to think that grabbing or harassing is alegitimate form of conflict resolution."Many times there is no real danger--men often slap each otheron the back, for example, but if a male employee who's had ahard day shoves a female co-worker, or blows up at her in theparking lot, it may be another story. Perhaps the two know eachother and the particular situation is harmless.Still, Johnson encourages talking to all individuals involved in areported incident, including any third-party witnesses, "so thatemployees realize what is and is not appropriate workplacebehavior."The threat-management plan should spell out who  receivesreports of threatening behavior (often this is the directsupervisor or the security manager) and how those reports aredelivered--in person, in writing, via a phone call to a outsidehotline, etc. "The method for handling complaints varies amongcompanies, depending on the corporate culture," says Johnson.The plan should also outline procedures for recognizingpotentially threatening behavior. Red flags include chronicabsenteeism, erratic work patterns, difficulty meeting deadlines,notable changes in personal appearance or conduct, unwarrantedanger or irritability and difficulty accepting criticism. Thefrequency, duration and effect of the behavioral change may allaffect the perception of its seriousness. Nonetheless, allquestionable behaviors warrant close monitoring.If, upon evaluation, you decide that action is required, manycompanies will bring in an independent, unbiased consultant toconduct a "dangerousness assessment," says Johnson. Thatprocess monitors warning signs and can pinpoint whether thereis a clear and immediate threat to identifiable targets.ATTITUDE SURVEYSAttitude surveys are a relatively benign way to gauge employees'perceptions of the organization. "They're a kind of 'early-warningsystem' that reveals trends and changes in the mood andbehavior of employees," Johnson says. Surveys involve one-on-one, confidential interviews ("usually 20- to 40-minutes") withrandomly selected employees. Some employees are also asked tofill out confidential questionnaires."Attitude surveys help us tap into attitudes and show whatbarriers or constraints exist in the workplace. They help identifystrengths and weaknesses, and we often can find out if there areany illegal or unprofessional practices, as well as general securityvulnerabilities."Johnson claims that in more than a decade of working withthreat-management programs, his firm has never yet conductedan attitude survey that did not lead to substantive change. Heencourages companies to share feedback from the surveys withemployees, who often can help solve internal problems andanalyze what might be done to achieve a safer workenvironment.

For men, homicide ranked just behind motor vehicleaccidents in the number of work-related fatalities. For women,homicide was the leading cause of death.  *  Most homicides resulted from gunshot wounds during arobbery attempt between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. Robberies oftenoccurred while  employees were locking up at night or makingmoney drops or pickups.  *  Business disputes accounted for 261 deaths, 45 of whichinvolved a current or former co-worker, and 35 of whichinvolved a customer or client.  *  Workplace homicide is primarily an urban problem, withnearly half of the incidents occurring in the retail trade.Convenience stores, restaurants, bars and gas stations werehardest hit. One-sixth of the homicides occurred in serviceindustries, including guard and armored-car services, hotels andmotels, and health and educational services. Taxicab companiesand police protection also were  affected.  *  Occupations incurring 50 or more homicides in 1992included supervisors and sales proprietors, taxicab drivers andchauffeurs, cashiers, managers of food and lodgingestablishments, food preparation and service occupations, policeand detectives, and private guards.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE SECURITY via NewsNetApril 15, 1994RISK FACTORS AND WARNING SIGNSA person who is at risk for workplace violence will often displaysome of these characteristic behaviors:  *  Accepts authority and criticism with difficulty;  *  Holds grudges, especially against supervisors;  *  Sabotages company property and/or equipment;  *  States desire to harm co-workers or managers;  *  Makes unwanted romantic/sexual overtures;  *  Engages in physical/verbal intimidation (e.g.,stalking, anonymous phone calls);  *  Displays progressively worsening conduct;  *  Is argumentative or uncooperative;  *  Has a history of interpersonal conflict;  *  Has been fired or laid off--or expects to be soon;  *  Comes from an unstable or dysfunctional family;  *  Displays decreased social connectedness;  *  Expresses extremist opinions or attitudes (e.g.,     religious or political);  *  Seems intrigued by previous acts of workplace violence;  *  Asked for help in past but did not receive it;  *  Exhibits paranoid behavior;  *  Has difficulty controlling temper;  *  Bears a sense of entitlement;  *  Seems emotionally injured;  *  Has a preoccupation with weapons;  *  Brings weapon(s) to work and may display  for effect.Source: Behavior Analysts & Consultants, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE SECURITY via NewsNetApril 15, 1994INFORMATION NETWORKS FACE MOUNTING HACKERINTRUSIONFew corporate communications networks are safe fromelectronic intrusion. Hackers who once engaged in mere high-tech mischief are now probing new digital communicationstechnologies for flaws that may yield big financial gains.However, private network operators and telecommunicationscompanies can take steps to close security loopholes, accordingto network security experts speaking  at the International VirusPrevention and Information Security Conference, sponsored bythe National Computer Security Association in Arlington, Va.,March 31.Ted S. Phillips, a telecommunications security associate at Booz,Allen & Hamilton Inc., believes domestic and internationaltelecommunications companies and long-distance carriernetworks are increasingly at risk for computer crimes. Open-systems architecture such as Signalling System 7 and advancedintelligent network technology are also vulnerable. In the newsystems, carriers and users share responsibility foradministration, network elements interconnect, and customer-premises equipment ties more closely to the public switchednetwork, all of which heighten network vulnerability.To an intruder, multiple points of entry into telecommunicationsnetworks "raises the number of attack vectors," Phillips says."Hackers can easily enter a company's system via an X.25network or a dial-in modem."Once inside the system, hackers can disrupt network service andobtain or modify data. In extreme cases, they have been knownto steal communications equipment and software manuals fromcompany premises and use confidential data for extortion orfraud. However they compromise a system, hackers causecompanies to lose revenue and investor confidence, and mayeven threaten public security by tampering with emergencyservices communications. Yet hackers rarely destroy the systemsthey have entered. They "want to keep systems up and running,"Phillips says, so they can continue to grab information andremain inconspicuous.SMOOTH OPERATORS GLEAN VALUABLE PASSWORDSPhillips notes that hackers often obtain their best information by"social engineering"--basically, smooth talking office personnelinto releasing passwords and access codes. "This is a real threat"to security systems, he says, but there are ways of protectingsystems."Keep control of internal 'phone books' that list passwords,"Phillips advises. "Shred documents that contain access codes.Train secretaries to question people who walk in the door askingfor information. And put locks on your dumpsters." Believe it ornot, trash bins are prime targets for hackers seeking manualsand documents that contain sensitive information.Also speaking at the conference, Hank M. Kluepfel, managingdirector for government accounts at Bellcore, encouraged systemusers to discard easily discernible passwords based on commonnames and to use combinations of alpha and numeric charactersinstead.For example, a user named Mary Elizabeth could use thecorresponding numbers on touch-tone telephone keys for thename "Beth," plus the letter J for the month of her birthdate--2384J--or the corresponding letters for her house address, plusthe number 2 for her two children, for example.Companies can further minimize the risk of intrusion by creatingsecurity guidelines and responsible safeguards for staff. "Let youremployees know what is expected of them and how the systemworks," Kluepfel says. He adds that many companies keep theiremployees in the dark about security for fear that a disgruntledbut knowledgeable employee will wreak havoc on the system. Or,they fail to penalize employees who ignore simple guidelines.Kluepfel also urged companies and telecommunicationsproviders to exchange information on hackers and their tactics.Companies should also demand better security from equipmentvendors. "Let vendors know what you expect," Kluepfel says.Customer input will force equipment vendors to put securityconcerns into the product development stage, and will helpcompanies avoid the time and often damaging expense ofimplementing such mechanisms retroactively.When operating a network, Kluepfel advises companies to "thinklike a hacker" by noting the most secure and the most vulnerablelocations in a system, as well as the most valuable information,which is most likely to be stolen if not protected.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE SECURITY via NewsNetApril 15, 1994TACO BELL IN HOT SALSA OVER HOLD-UPAfter Claudia Piagentini was fired for refusing to report for hernight shift after a robber held a gun to her head at a NorthernCalifornia franchise, she sued Taco Bell for failing to provide asafe workplace.The woman's suit contends that her boss agreed she could comeoff the night shift and work days for one month after themidnight robbery in March of 1993.

Jobduties may include hovering nearby through interminablemeetings, elbowing paths through bustling airports, attendinghigh-profile parties, stoically keeping watch through long nightswithout sleeping, chauffering protectees around town, evenrunning errands that ought to fall under someone else's jobdescription, but don't. It's a job that offers some excitement--anda lot of boredom.Large cities naturally have the greatest call for bodyguards--NewYork City, Los Angeles and Washington, followed by Chicago,tend to require the most, says Richard Ward, a former NewYork City detective, now a chancellor at the University ofIllinois at Chicago. "You've got sports figures, entertainmentpeople, organized crime figures who require [protection], andbusiness people with money who feel they need someone aroundthem."Ed Scheu of Thompson Professional Services in Chicago,recently guarded an executive whose company had laid offseveral hundred employees. "He was the No. 2 man with thecompany. He had gotten multiple threats, letters, phone calls tohis house," recalls Scheu. "One of them said to his wife, 'We'regoing to get that [expletive] you're married to.'"With workplace violence rising, so will the perceived need forbodyguards, predicts Scheu. Where does one go to find abodyguard? Word of mouth, the Yellow Pages and newspapersare good places to start. Many companies that sell ormanufacture security alarms, such as ADT or Honeywell, canalso recommend protection services. However, "most CEOs andcorporate presidents have a known network they can call on forprotection," says Scheu. "A lot of paranoia prevails in theseupper echelons; once one has been threatened, he lets the othersknow and it heightens the paranoia."Bodyguards come from all walks of life: former FBI or SecretService agents, ex-Marines, retired or moonlighting policeofficers, private investigators, corporate security guards, etc.Most are men, but increasing numbers of women are getting intothe field.Fortunately, you need not look like Shawn Eckardt to be abodyguard. In fact, brains are far more desirable than brawn(testimony to Eckardt's flub-up in "protecting" Tonya Harding)."The most effective bodyguard is someone who's low-key,unobstrusive and meshes with the environment," says BranchWalton, a 21-year veteran of the Secret Service in Springfield,Ill.And pay? "A mug off the street will probably make from $20,000to $30,000 a year," says Ward. "Generally, a professional is goingto make between $50,000 and $100,000."Becoming a bodyguard requires no formal training, but would-beprotectors can pick up training tips--such as how to placateaggressive autograph seekers or fend off would-be kneeknockers--at police departments or schools like the ExecutiveProtection Institute, headquartered in Berryville, Va. EPI hasbranches nationwide and offers a variety of classes, includingcriminal education and law enforcement litigation.Some universities, such as the University of Illinois at Chicago,are starting to offer short courses on personal protection andphysical security. Ward recently asked Scheu to conduct a two-day course on security issues for Chicago-area law enforcementpersonnel."Basically," however, Ward notes, "anyone can hang out theirshingle and say they're a bodyguard."Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE SECURITY via NewsNetApril 15, 1994CHECKLIST FOR EXECUTIVE TRAVELERSFor executives working or traveling abroad, heeding practicalsafety hints could help you avoid injury, or even save your life.Kimberly Heine, security officer for York College ofPennsylvania and a certified protection officer, offers these tips.CAR TRAVEL  *  Avoid dangerous areas of the city.  *  Never travel on abandoned roads.  *  Keep the gas level above half a tank.  *  Check the back seat and floor of the car for anythingsuspicious before getting into it.  *  Lock car doors and keep windows rolled up at all times.  *  Familiarize yourself with routes to and from work.  * Trade vehicles with friends or associates occasionally.  *  Equip a car with a cellular phone or other form ofcommunications system.  *  Don't drive  flashy cars that may attract attention.  *  Try not to park on the street overnight.  *  Be aware of anyone driving closely behind you or following thesame route.PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION  *  Travel in pairs when taking taxis.  *  Vary your method of transportation.  *  Always have correct change with you; don't carry big bills orcredit cards.  *  Avoid wearing expensive-looking clothes or jewelry.  * Observe the goings on around you, yet keep a low profile.HOTELS  *  Lock and chain the door at all times.  *  Use  the "Do Not Disturb" sign while you're in the room.  *  Tell the hotel management not to release any informationabout you.  *  Be suspicious of unusual calls.  *  Leave the radio or TV on when you're out in the evenings.  *  Never leave valuable  information in the room.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE SECURITY via NewsNetApril 15, 1994CS READERSHIP PROFILE:PROFESSIONAL, INVOLVED, SAVVYResponses to our recent survey of Corporate Security subscribersconfirmed our longstanding impressions: Our readers are highlymotivated professionals with a strong interest both in stayingabreast of the latest developments affecting the security function,as well learning how their colleagues are meeting the challengeof delivering security services in a time of tight budgets andheavy workloads.

Are we required to letinvestigators search our computer disks and backup tapes?A:  Yes, if you are sued or formally charged with criminalviolations, a court order can force you to open your electronicfiles. Your former employee has a tough case to prove, but"attorneys are starting to aggressively target electronic data," saysJohn Jessen, of Electronic Evidence Discovery, a Seattleinvestigation firm.Electronic mail should not be considered a secure medium forsharing sensitive data about company plans and actions. Jessenhas worked on cases in which investigators recovered supposedlydeleted e-mail messages that used descriptive expletives to attackemployees' personalities instead of their work performance. Inone instance, the plaintiff settled out of court for $250,000.In 1993, a San Francisco federal district court ruled thatcompanies under criminal investigation should readily provide allcompany-related electronic files to prosecutors. Not turning overfiles at once could be an offense itself.Advice:  Tell employees what communications can be usedagainst them in court. Back up and label data carefully. And,don't send anything via e-mail that you wouldn't broadcast overa loudspeaker.Q:  One of our employees has received anonymous e-mailmessages that are racist and hostile. His boss also has receivedmessages that criticize his managerial skills and question hiscompetency. Trouble is, we don't know who's sending themessages. What can we do?A:  Most electronic messaging software requires senderidentification, but a few products do allow anonymity. Onerationale for the new software is that unidentified messages maypromote interoffice discussion of formerly taboo topics. Anaerospace manufacturer claims it's done wonders for getting hisemployees to brainstorm ideas. But the flip side is the problemyou describe.One solution is to pull the plug on your global e-mail system andrewrite your network software to enable tracking of allcommunications. Further, at least one Fortune 1,000 companynow has a policy forbidding unidentified harassment and hostilecriticism.Another solution is to follow the lead of Internet, the world'smost popular network for sharing electronic intimacies andwhistle-blower communiques. Internet requires a "returnaddress" on all messages. However, it also allows users to sendmessages to a "remailer"-- a message "launderer" that strips outthe original headers and inserts its own. Perhaps an electronicmiddleman is the answer.Q:  Must offensive conduct seriously affect an employee'spsychological well-being or cause actual injury in order to beunlawfully discriminatory? And, if so, how do we measure suchinjuries?A:  A unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruled late last year inHarris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. that Title VII provisions comeinto play long before offensive conduct leads a person to anervous breakdown or other serious malady. But determining thescope of injury is less than clear. An obnoxious or insensitivecomment may give one person an annoying headache, whilesending another running to a psychiatrist for Valium. Whichvictim has the stronger case?The Court ruled that if a "reasonable person" could perceive awork environment to be hostile or abusive, that person does notalso have to prove the conduct was psychologically harmful."Injurious" conduct may include attacks based on gender, race,color, religion or national origin and, most likely, disability andage.Other factors that may be considered are the frequency of theconduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening orhumiliating, whether it unreasonably interferes with the victim'swork, and whether it affects the victim's psychological well-being.In light of the ruling, employers should investigate all complaintsof inappropriate conduct and may want to broaden theirharassment policies.Q:  Our top car salesman sexually assaulted a customer while ona test drive. He was recently convicted on criminal charges, butthe company has now been sued for negligence in hiring. Thecustomer claims we failed to do a pre-employment criminalinvestigation, which would have shown the salesman was anoffender. Are we liable?A:  Some courts have ruled that employers can be held liable foran employee's actions if the company had any indication "byreason of past conduct, bad temper or otherwise" that the personwas potentially dangerous.However, while "a presumption exists that an employer has useddue care in hiring," most courts say that unless compellingevidence indicates a criminal investigation is appropriate,employers have no legal obligation to conduct such backgroundchecks.A North Carolina Court of Appeals dismissed a similar case,ruling that companies cannot be held responsible for anemployee's actions that occur beyond the scope of employmentor are "designed to carry out an independent purpose." In yourcase, the salesman's conducted clearly violated the bounds of hisduties and the company's expectations.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE SECURITY via NewsNetApril 15, 1994CLIPPER CHIP BATTLES STORMY SEASThe Clinton administration's decision to approve thecontroversial Clipper encryption device continues to make waves.Clipper is a computer chip that makes telephone trafficindecipherable to eavesdroppers, but allows the government a"trap door" so that investigators can access decrypted Clippercalls.During a public comment period, the administration received331 letters and comments; all but two criticized the technology.Last month a poll conducted for Time Inc. and CNN found that80 percent of the 1,000 respondents oppose Clipper and wouldrather protect the privacy of phone calls than allow police to tapwires.The FBI insists that the optional system grants authorities access"only when there's probable cause that there's criminal activity"taking place on scrambled lines.Yet at least 45,000 opponents have signed an electronic petitionagainst the new policy, saying they worry more aboutunscrupulous public servants than they do about "bad guys"trying to eavesdrop and/or steal data.At one point during the recent Computers, Freedom and PrivacyConference in Chicago, keynote speaker David A. Lytel, a WhiteHouse technology expert, looked around in exasperation andasked, "How many people here fear they are at greater risk fromgovernment abuses of power than criminal activity?"

ONDCPDirector Bob Martinez is not involved in the CLIA issueat this point but could enter the fray once ONDCPreceives an answer from HHS, the official said.Mr. Martinez' involvement would not be necessary if HHSdecides not to apply CLIA to private sector drug testing,but HHS officials maintain that, as of now, such testingis covered by the rule. CLIA requires that all labsconducting clinical tests "for the assessment of health"be certified by HHS. Based on a number of comments so farmade public, there is a widespread belief thatapplication of CLIA to private sector drug testing couldinhibit on-site testing and result in higher costs toemployers.The ONDCP letter was written by Bruce M. Carnes, ONDCP'sdirector of planning, budget, and administration, to MarkBarnes, Sullivan's special counsel on drug abuse policy.Through a spokesman, Mr. Carnes declined to release thetext of the letter or to comment on its contents. Mr.Barnes also declined to comment directly on the letter,but acknowledged that ONDCP had "communicated to uswithin the normal process of interagency communications"about CLIA.However, Barnes indicated that HHS is unlikely toexpedite a resolution of the drug testing question,saying that the department will publish a "final finalrule" by Sept. 1, the date CLIA is to take effect.Another HHS official confirmed the Sept. 1 target datefor resolution of the drug testing issue and indicatedthat officials and agencies within HHS are not inagreement on whether and to what extent CLIA shouldregulate drug testing.One potential resolution under consideration, accordingto officials within HHS, would be to redefine privatesector drug testing as "forensic" in nature. As publishedFeb. 28, the CLIA rule exempts from coverage forensictesting, defined as tests conducted to determine thesubject's legal status rather than health condition.However, drug testing advocates and regulators, includingthe National Institute on Drug Abuse, routinely refer toall drug testing as forensic. Adopting the broaderdefinition could be a relatively easy way to settle thequestion.Any change in the department's current interpretation ofCLIA will most likely be published in the FederalRegister, HHS officials said. However, one officialrefused to rule out the possibility that the rule couldbe reinterpreted without a formal published notice.In addition to the letter from Carnes, ONDCP submittedformal comments on CLIA to the Health Care FinancingAdministration (HCFA), the HHS agency implementing therule. In the comments, Frank M. Kalder, director of thebudget and legislative review staff, chided HHS for notconsulting ONDCP about CLIA's potential application todrug testing and warned that the rule could adverselyaffect drug treatment programs and small employers."It appears that under the CLIA interpretation ofpermissible drug testing, alcohol and drug treatmentfacilities would be prohibited from conducting routineon-site drug testing to monitor patient drug use," Mr.Kalder wrote. "In addition, we also are concerned thatthese rules will make the process very complex andexpensive, and thus, may cause many employers todiscontinue their drug testing programs."Kalder asked HCFA to explain why an exemption ofemployment and insurance screening contained in aNovember 1991 draft of the rule was dropped in thepublished document, and said "ONDCP believes theexemptions should be reinstated."He also asked for a "legal interpretation" of CLIA'sapplicability to drug testing and its definition of"forensic testing," and asked for an assessment of thecost to businesses that would need certification shouldHHS continue to apply CLIA to drug testing.In other comments, Byron Lee Jr., president and chiefexecutive officer of the Nuclear Management and ResourcesCouncil (NUMARC), a group of nuclear power companies,expressed concern that CLIA might cover on-site testingunder the Nuclear Regulatory Commission'sfitness-for-duty program. He said the tests should fallunder CLIA's definition of forensic because they areconducted to detect violations of law."During the past two years, over one-half million urinesamples have been collected by the nation's nuclearutilities for these testing purposes only, not forclinical treatment, medical diagnosis, health assessment,or disease prevention," Lee wrote. "Nuclear powerindustry drug testing should be considered forensictesting since it is performed to determine if a federalregulation has been violated."Dr. Brock Wisenberger, director of corporate employeehealth for Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park, Ill.,agreed. "The assessment of abused and/or illegalsubstances as part of a Corporate Drug-Free Workplaceprogram is identical in purpose to drug testing performedby law enforcement agencies to determine whether therehas been a violation of the law," he said.Rep. Bill Lowery (R-Calif.) requested that all privatesector drug testing be exempted from CLIA. "It is mybelief that the purpose of drug testing for employmentpurposes is not to provide results for diagnosis ortreatment of an individual, but to comply with corporatedrug abuse policies," he wrote. Regulating drug testingthrough CLIA would "seriously impede" the BushAdministration's drug control strategy, he said.Not every comment on drug testing was opposed to itsregulation by CLIA. The American Hospital Association'ssenior vice president for policy, Dr. James D. Bentley,said employment and insurance screening should be coveredby CLIA because they are for "assessment of health."And the American Clinical Laboratory Associationrecommended that enzyme immunoassays (EIA) bereclassified from moderately complex to highly complex.Such a change would impose more stringent standards andpersonnel requirements on EIA tests.-- Dave McIntyreBack to Headline List CopyrightDRUG DETECTION REPORT via NewsNetMay 20, 1992TWO GROUPS REACH PACT FORSTANDARD MRO CERTIFICATIONSTwo medical professional organizations have reached atentative agreement to create a standardizedaccreditation process for medical review officers,according to officials of both organizations.Once carried out, the agreement would avoid a potentiallyconfusing situation in which competing organizationswould be promoting their own ethical standards andcertifying processes for MROs, who review test results infederally mandated drug testing programs.The agreement was reached May 4 by representatives of theAmerican College of Occupational and EnvironmentalMedicine, a physicians' group established in 1916, andthe American Association of Medical Review Officers,established last year to promote MRO standards. AAMRObegan conducting certifying examinations for MROs inMarch, and ACOEM was scheduled to begin its own testingprogram this fall.Under the agreement, a new organization (yet to be named)will be formed to administer the MRO certifying process.The two organizations still need to negotiate a "commondocument" of MRO standards, but have agreed to poolquestions from their own certifying exams to create a newtest, according to Dr. Kent Peterson, treasurer of ACOEMand chairman of its MRO training course. "It's going tobe a tough exam," he said.Initially, the organization will be governed byrepresentatives of both ACOEM and AAMRO, but othermedical groups will be invited to participate, Dr.Peterson said. The new organization will be located atACOEM's headquarters in Arlington Heights, Ill., andshould begin operating by July 1, he added.The agreement firmly establishes the fledgling AAMRO inthe ranks of professional medical organizations. Dr.Peterson said AAMRO "showed leadership" on the issue ofestablishing MRO standards and certification procedures.He denied reports that ACOEM had been reluctant to workwith AAMRO, saying only that "ACOEM's position has alwaysbeen that the credentialing of physicians should be inthe hands of a professional organization."Dr. Steven St. Clair, AAMRO's executive director, saidthe negotiations "were not tense, though there was a lotof misunderstanding about what each other was doing"about MRO certification. "Once we sat down at the table,the misconceptions were dealt with pretty easily," hesaid.Dr. St. Clair said federal drug testing officials, manyof whom sit on AAMRO's federal advisory board, "haveexpressed uniform enthusiasm" about the agreement. "Thiseffort was largely created because of concerns expressedby federal regulators and individual MROs about thepossibility of having more than one standard that mighthave developed had the two organizations continuedseparately."Dr. Peterson echoed that point. "We felt the benefits ofa common procedure far outweighed the tendency of bothgroups to pursue their own programs," he said.Dr. St. Clair said MROs already certified by AAMRO willautomatically receive certification by the neworganization.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG DETECTION REPORT via NewsNetMay 20, 1992DOT WEIGHS ZERO TOLERANCEPOLICY ON ALCOHOL TESTINGFederal officials are debating what cutoff levels theDepartment of Transportation should use for its alcoholtesting regulation, with some pushing for "zerotolerance" and others arguing that a hard-line approachcould be perceived as a "witch hunt," according to asenior DOT official.Some officials favor penalizing transportation workerswho are found to have any traces of alcohol in theirsystems, while others propose pegging the department'sregulation with standard drunk driving cutoffs, which areusually 0.08 percent or 0.1 percent blood-alcoholcontent, according to Dr. Donna R. Smith, senior programanalyst in DOT's drug enforcement and program complianceoffice.The department is developing the alcohol testing rule toimplement the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Actof 1991, signed by President Bush last October.Dr. Smith discussed DOT's rulemaking deliberations at aMay 16 meeting of the Substance Abuse ProgramAdministrators Association in Crystal City, Va., and inan interview with DRUG DETECTION REPORT.She said some DOT officials--supported by the NationalTransportation Safety Board, an agency independent ofDOT, and the National Institute on Alcoholism, part ofthe Department of Health and Human Services--favor a"zero tolerance" approach. Other officials fear theAmerican public might see such a tough line as a "witchhunt" or "a new Prohibition" and advocate adopting themore tolerant drunk driving standard to minimize the riskof legal challenges, she said.The department is sensitive to the political issuesbecause "alcohol is America's favorite legal drug," andbelieves that because alcohol consumption is legal, thecutoff levels should be tied as closely as possible toimpairment, Dr. Smith said. "We can't necessarily provethat mere presence of alcohol causes risks," she said,explaining potential drawbacks to a zero cutoff."We cannot say that a person who consumes alcohol by thatvery consumption is a risk in a safety-sensitiveposition," Dr. Smith said. "We can say a person whodrinks while or just before performing safety-sensitiveduties is a risk. We need to establish a nexus ofimpairment."Because of the perceived need to link alcohol testing toimpairment, cutoff levels of 0.04 percent or 0.02 percentare also under consideration because of researchindicating measurable impairment at those levels, shesaid.The Bush Administration has not taken a position in thedebate, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy isnot advocating a particular cutoff level, she said.The decision on which cutoff level to use will affectmore than the public's perception of the alcohol testingprogram--it will also influence the department's choiceof testing methodology, Dr. Smith said. That choice hasbeen a tough one for department officials because eachpotential method--saliva, blood, breath, and urine--hasits own advantages and drawbacks, she said.For example, a zero cutoff would effectively rule outsaliva testing, which is potentially effective at 0.04percent but not sensitive enough at zero, she said. Atthe higher cutoff, saliva tests could be an easy andcost-efficient screening device, but they have noforensic track record, have not withstood courtchallenges, and the connection between alcohol content ina person's saliva and a person's blood remains"theoretical," she said.Blood is "the gold standard" in forensic testing, able todetect trace amounts of alcohol, "but in workplace randomtesting, blood is unattractive" because it is invasiveand expensive, Dr. Smith said. Breath testing meetsforensic standards but "is by no means cheap," she said.In addition, breath testing combines in one device andone operator the specimen collection, laboratoryanalysis, and medical review functions the departmentpurposely separates in its drug testing program tomaintain objectivity.Finally, urine testing for alcohol has the same potentialdrawback as the zero cutoff level--it cannot demonstratethat the person is impaired at the time of the test.The decisions on cutoff levels and testing methods mustbe made soon, for Transportation Secretary Andrew Cardplans to have a final rule in effect before the Oct. 28deadline, Dr. Smith said. The department still hopes topublish its proposed rule before the end of June, sheadded.-- Dave McIntyreBack to Headline List CopyrightDRUG DETECTION REPORT via NewsNetMay 20, 1992ROADSIDE TESTING PROJECTCOULD BE AHEAD OF SCHEDULEThe Department of Transportation's pilot project onroadside drug and alcohol testing could begin as early aslate August, more than three months ahead of schedule,according to Dr. Donna R. Smith, senior analyst withDOT's drug enforcement and program compliance office.The department recently chose four states--Utah,Minnesota, Nebraska, and New Jersey--to implement theprogram, which is meant to discover if random testingthat is not employer-based can be conducted in aneffective and cost-efficient manner, Dr. Smith told DRUGDETECTION REPORT. Congress mandated the one-year, $5million project as part of the Omnibus TransportationEmployee Testing Act of 1991, but the project isproceeding independently of the department's rulemakingon that legislation.According to the legislation, implementation of the pilotprograms is to begin no later than January 1993. However,Dr. Smith said, some of the states have indicated theycould begin testing as early as August.Dr. Smith said each of the four states will develop itsown testing plan, including locations and methodology oftesting, so the department will have four separateexperiences to evaluate. She said the programs couldinclude on-site drug and alcohol screening or traditionalspecimen collection, depending on what the statespropose. DOT is considering whether to have the statescontract individually with laboratories to perform thetests or to have all four programs use one laboratoryselected by the department, she said.Employers could save a lot of money if the responsibilityfor drug testing is taken over by states, and Dr. Smithindicated that one important objective of the pilotprogram is to calculate the expense of roadside testing.However, interest in roadside testing is not great amongstate governments--only six submitted applications forthe pilot program, Dr. Smith said.The department is particularly concerned that truckersmight easily be able to avoid the tests, she said. Stateimplementation plans will have to address means ofpreventing truckers from informing each other about testtimes and locations, taking alternate routes to avoidtesting sites, or "congregating at previous truck stops"to avoid areas where tests are being conducted, she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG DETECTION REPORT via NewsNetMay 20, 1992OMB APPROVES STANDARDCHAIN-OF-CUSTODY FORMFederal agencies conducting urine drug testing programswill soon be required to use a standardizedchain-of-custody form, according to Dr. Joseph H. AutryIII, director of applied research at the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse.NIDA and the Department of Transportation developed thestandardized form to simplify the specimen collectionprocess and reduce the number of errors that cause teststo be canceled. Currently, the government specifies whatinformation is to be contained on chain-of-custody formsbut allows labs and agencies to develop their owndocuments. That has led to confusion amongcollection-site personnel, who frequently must useseveral different forms depending on which agency or labwas doing the testing.The standard form received approval from the Office ofManagement and Budget early this month, Dr. Autry toldDRUG DETECTION REPORT. Agencies will be notified of thenew requirement in a Federal Register notice, and anyagency wishing to use a different form will need OMBapproval, he said.The form will also be required in all DOT-regulated drugtesting, according to Dr. Donna R. Smith, senior analystwith the department's drug enforcement and programcompliance office. The form includes a notice that thetest is conducted according to federal guidelines andregulations, as well as a Privacy Act statement forfederal employees, she said. The Privacy Act statementwill not apply to DOT testing.Dr. Smith said OMB so far has approved the form only forfederal employee testing, but that the department willsubmit the requirement as part of its proposed rule onthe Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991.Since OMB has already approved the form once, thedepartment expects no problems getting it through OMBagain, she said.Companies will not be authorized to use the form fortesting not conducted under DOT regulations because theform certifies that the test was conducted "in accordancewith applicable Federal regulations." However, companiescould adapt the form as a model for their own programs,Dr. Autry said."I'd like to see the private sector take that form andstrip off the Privacy Act part and the federal identifierand use that as a uniform document for all drug testing.That would make life a lot easier for the labs."Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG DETECTION REPORT via NewsNetMay 20, 1992NIDA ALLOWS MRO'S TO REQUESTCODEINE LEVEL BELOW CUTOFFMedical review officers may request from labs thequantitative levels for codeine on specimens reportedpositive for morphine only, the National Institute onDrug Abuse informed laboratories in April. The additionalinformation could help MROs determine whether positivemorphine tests received from labs should be reported toemployers as positives.NIDA's instructions on MRO's receiving the codeineinformation were contained in an April 9 advisory sent todirectors of NIDA-certified laboratories and allinspectors within the National Laboratory CertificationProgram.MROs are normally not allowed to request quantitativedata below the cutoffs, but information on the presenceof codeine could help the MRO determine whether the testsubject was perhaps using codeine legitimately, accordingto Dr. Donna Bush, chief of NIDA's drug testing section.This is because codeine metabolizes to morphine in thebody, but some codeine is often found in the urine aswell, she said."What the MRO is looking for is any evidence of codeineto try to support use of codeine as opposed to morphineby itself," she explained.Laboratories are authorized to release quantitativecodeine levels below cutoffs only in writing afterreceiving a written request from the MRO, and only whenthe codeine level is above the lab's limit of detectionand limit of quantification criteria, the advisory said.In the advisory, NIDA also urged inspectors to "avoidconfrontation" and "maintain objectivity" in theirdealings with laboratory officials.This was at least the second attempt by NIDA to defusetensions within its certification program. An Oct. 18,1991, advisory referred to "an occasional emotionalmoment" caused by "over-aggressive inspector behavior"and reminded inspectors to "practice the higheststandards of professionalism and objectivity."Tensions arise because inspectors--many of whom arethemselves laboratory officials--often have very definiteviews about how best to fulfill NIDA's mandatorylaboratory guidelines, Dr. Bush said. These views willdiffer, she said, because the guidelines establishminimum standards without specifying how they are to bemet.The latest advisory reminds inspectors that they are"fact finders" who should "focus on adequacy, notexcellence; maintain objectivity; gather information;inspect, do not suggest; ask questions when clarificationis needed; respect proprietary rights; handle conflicts;[and] avoid confrontation."One contentious issue during inspections has been whichlab personnel should have access to the area where thelab receives and processes urine specimens, the advisoryindicated. NIDA said there is "no definitive answer" tothat question because laboratory size, staffing, andworkloads differ."It appears that this will be a dynamic and arguablearea," the advisory said. "Inspectors must continue tomake objective observations and assessments...and clearlyexpress their evaluation in the report. This is one areawhere preconceived opinions are not desirable. This isalso an area where [inspection] team discussion andexplanation by the laboratory staff is usuallybeneficial."The advisory also contained several points regardingchain-of-custody documentation for NIDA-regulated drugtesting. Improperly completed forms are the leading causeof drug tests being canceled, according to federalofficials.* Copy 3 of the chain-of-custody form, which goes fromthe collection site to the MRO, must not pass through thelaboratory, even in sealed envelopes.* Laboratories must document the condition of specimenbottle seals on Copy 2 of the chain-of-custody document(from lab to the MRO). If the lab reports to the MROelectronically via computer, it may not use defaultsettings indicating the seal was intact, since anoversight could improperly inform the MRO that the sealwas acceptable. A separate entry must be made for eachseal.* Although "brevity and simplicity are desirable" inchain-of-custody documentation, the record must "presenta clear picture of the location of the specimen/aliquotat all times to third parties. Only then does a[chain-of-custody] document fulfill the definition andserve its purpose for review, scrutiny, or challenge."-- Dave McIntyreBack to Headline List CopyrightDRUG DETECTION REPORT via NewsNetMay 20, 1992ONE IN FOUR LAW AGENCIESTESTED APPLICANTS IN 1990One-quarter of the nation's police and sheriffs'departments required drug tests of all applicants forsworn officer positions in 1990, but only 2 percentrequired tests of all regular field officers, accordingto a new report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.The report, which included 1990 data from 11,800 locallaw enforcement agencies, found that drug testing wasmore common in police departments than sheriffs'departments, and in departments serving large populationsthan smaller ones. For example, 79 percent of policedepartments serving populations of 1 million or morepeople required drug tests of all applicants, while only14 percent of police departments serving 2,500 or fewerdid so.Random testing of regular field officers was required by4 percent of all local agencies, but by 21 percent ofpolice departments serving 1 million or more people. Thesurvey said 17 percent of all sworn police officers and12 percent of sworn sheriffs' officers were subject torandom testing. Random testing was most common forofficers in drug-related positions employed by policedepartments serving a population of 1 million or more (36percent).Reasonable suspicion tests were more common. One in every10 agencies conducted such tests, covering 50 percent ofsworn police officers and 31 percent of sheriffs'officers. Of civilian personnel, 45 percent in policedepartments and 30 percent in sheriffs' departments weresubject to reasonable suspicion testing.Sixty-three percent of the local agencies listeddismissal as the most serious discipline for a firstpositive drug test, with 14 percent listing suspension.After two positives, 94 percent listed dismissal as theirmost serious sanction, and only 2 percent said they stopat suspension.Nearly half (47 percent) of the agencies said they offernonprobationary officers treatment after a positive drugtest. However, the larger police departments (1 millionor more population) were least likely to offer treatment(20 percent).Nearly 40 percent of the local police and sheriffs'departments reported that at least some of theirarrestees were tested for illegal drugs. Such testing wasmost common in police departments serving populations of500,000 or more (56 percent) and in sheriffs' departmentsserving 1 million or more (60 percent)."Drug Enforcement by Police and Sheriffs' Departments,1990," (NCJ-134505), a 10-page report, is availablethrough the National Criminal Justice Reference Service,Box 6000, Rockville MD 20850.

(Crain v. EmploymentSecurity Department, Washington Court of Appeals,Division One, No. 27826-6-I, April 13, 1992.)Although the drug test alone was insufficient evidence toprove misconduct, it could be considered along with theworker's job performance and his agreement with theemployer, the court said.Larry B. Crain tested positive for cocaine and marijuanain April 1987 and was suspended from his job as aproduction worker. The company agreed to reinstate himprovided he complete a drug treatment program and agreeto follow-up drug tests. Under the agreement, a secondpositive test would result in Crain's firing.Soon after returning to work, Crain received verbalwarnings from his supervisors for following improperprocedures. In October 1987, Crain's failure to properlyclamp part of a 200-ton machine caused "considerabledamage" to the equipment. Crain denied he was again usingdrugs, but the company ordered him to submit to a testbecause of the series of warnings he had been issuedsince returning to work. He tested positive for marijuanaand was discharged.The state Employment Security Department denied Crain'sapplication for unemployment benefits, but anadministrative law judge overturned that decision, rulingthat the department's policy prohibited using drug testresults to show that an employee was "under theinfluence."According to the department's Unemployment Procedures &Methods Handbook, revised Oct. 30, 1986, "The results ofdrug testing may not establish impairment or indicate(with precision) when an illegal drug was used; suchresults can only demonstrate the likelihood of prior druguse. Therefore, discharging an employee based solely onthe employee's refusing to take or failing a drug test,absent adverse job performance, is not misconduct."The department commissioner, however, reversed the ALJ'sdecision, finding instead that Crain's violation of thelast-chance agreement qualified as misconduct.The appeals court agreed. Although drug test results are"hearsay" evidence, and Washington employment law doesnot allow misconduct to be proved exclusively by hearsay,the court said the company relied on other evidence indischarging Crain. Specifically, the court cited theseries of incidents involving Crain's work."Because this other evidence of drug impairment supportedthe Commissioner's finding that Crain had violated hisre-entry agreement to remain drug-free, the Commissionerdid not err by also considering the test results to finddisqualifying misconduct," the court ruled.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG DETECTION REPORT via NewsNetMay 20, 1992COURT UPHOLDS DRUG TESTOF GUARD WITHOUT POLICYLouisiana corrections officials properly ordered a guardto take a drug test based on allegations that the guardhad used drugs at a crack house, even though theCorrections Department had no drug testing policy inplace at the time, a state court has ruled. (Banks v.Department of Public Safety and Corrections, LouisianaCourt of Appeals, First Circuit, No. CA 91 0136, April10, 1992.)Department officials received a tip from the Baton Rougesheriff's department that one of their correctionsofficers, Simmie Banks, had allegedly been observedsmoking crack in a crack house that was undersurveillance. Department officials contacted the juveniledetention facility where Banks worked and ordered thesupervisor to send Banks to a laboratory for a drug test.Banks refused to take the test without first consultingan attorney, and was fired.At the time (September 1989), the department did not havea drug testing policy in place. The court ruled, however,that the department was within its rights to order a drugtest because it had reasonable suspicion to believe Bankshad used drugs and because corrections officers aresubject to bodily searches as conditions of employment.Banks was therefore properly disciplined for refusing alegitimate order, the court ruled.The court relied on the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings inSkinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Association andNational Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, which itsaid implied that "a governmental employer's order to anemployee to submit to a drug test on the basis ofindividualized suspicion of drug use is constitutionallyvalid in certain circumstances." The circumstances inthis case included the government's interest inmaintaining order at detention centers and in keepingdrugs away from prisoners. Guards who use drugs "may bemuch more likely to be involved in the introduction ofcontraband into a correctional facility," the court said.The lack of a written, announced drug testing policy didnot invalidate the order to Banks, the court said."Although Mr. Banks stated that at no time during hisemployment at the [facility] was he informed that hewould be subject to drug testing, he did admit that heknew as a condition of his employment he was subject to:a bodily search or `shake-down' on a random basis,vehicle shake-down, and possibly a strip search. Mr.Banks admitted that he knew the Corrections ServicesRulebook prohibited employees from violating state orfederal law and that to do so could result intermination."In addition, "an employee's refusal to obey a directorder is conduct which, by its very nature, impairs theefficient operation of the public service for which hewas employed."Back to Headline List WT03-B08-12IA087-000634-B047-254http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/mt15.html 205.156.212.5 19970122033620 text/html 34241HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:34:25 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:45 GMTContent-length: 34054Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/mt15.html Sample Issue Copyright DRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE via NewsNet May 1, 1994 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES LABS AND TESTING: MANDATED EMPLOYERS HAVE RULES, NON-MANDATED EMPLOYERS DON'T (1199 words) DRUG TESTING OF NON-SAFETY- SENSITIVE WORKERS UPHELD (416 words) SURVEY: OVER ONE THIRD OF EMPLOYERS FIRE AT FIRST POSITIVE (337 words) EAPS NEED TQM (803 words) COMING UP-- (109 words) HOW TESTING CAN REDUCE WORKERS' COMPENSATION COSTS (738 words) PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION OFFERS MODEL DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE LAWS (258 words) BORG-WARNER GUARDS TESTED AS APPLICANTS (135 words) LAB CERTIFICATION: HEADED FOR FDA?

You may even be told expresslynot to fire someone who tests positive, but tosend him to treatment or an EAP first.But unless you are mandated by the governmentto conduct testing this way, you don't have todo any of these things. So, why do lawyers,consultants, and other purveyors of advice toemployers insist on using the guidelines thatare mandatory mainly for federal employees andsafety-sensitive employees in DOT-licensedcompanies?'NOT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT'"The HHS guidelines are not a legalrequirement," explains David Evans, a lawyer inLawrenceville, New Jersey who is an expert ondrug testing. "But the reason lawyers like touse them is because they're written down."Lawyers, says Evans, "love it when somebodygives them some complex regulation and they canhit somebody over the head with it." Evans saysemployers who follow HHS/SAMHSA/DOT protocolsunnecessarily are "putting on too much goldplate."Not everyone agrees. "It's worth going throughwhat compliance programs go through," says MacAllen, executive director of the SubstanceAbuse Program Administrators Association(SAPAA), a Nashville-based group of corporateand third-party drug-testing programs. "I don'tthink the lab is the key as much as the MRO isthe key," says Allen. "If an employee testspositive for opiates, for example, and he'susing a bona-fide prescription drug, he wouldbe protected."But most SAPAA members are DOT-mandatedemployers, or third-party administrators whowant work from DOT-mandated employers. For asmall business, on-site hand-held tests mightbe the way to go."Some of the on-site tests are pretty good,"says J. Michael Walsh, who wrote the federalguidelines before he left government last yearto run a private consulting business. As longas the test is an FDA-approved immunoassay, theemployer should feel confident using it, hesays. If the employer plans to take actionagainst an employee, however, Walsh recommendsthat any on-site test which is positive beconfirmed by sending the sample to a lab.One reason it is important to confirm anon-site test in a lab, especially in the caseof opiates or amphetamines, is a phenomenonknown as cross-reactivity, says Walsh. But ifyou use the on-site tests just for marijuanaand cocaine, there is nothing thatcross-reacts, he adds.The HHS system was set up because of search andseizure concerns. The first people to be testedunder it were federal employees, and the systemhad to pass constitutional muster because itwas government action. "There's a two-prongedtest for search and seizure," explains Evans."The search must be justified in its inception,which means there must be proper reason for thesearch. And it must be justified in its scope,which means you shouldn't search for anythingexcept what you're searching for." This meansthat a drug test shouldn't look forprescription medication, for example, or poppyseeds on a bagel. The federal government triedto deal with both prongs of thesearch-and-seizure issue in developing the HHSguidelines.Private employers don't need to worry aboutsearch and seizure at all, however.The federal guidelines initially avoidedon-site testing "because we knew we'd havecourt challenges," says Walsh, and officialswanted the system to withstand legal scrutiny.But technology has changed, and so has thesophistication level of people involved inon-site testing. "Now people know how to usehand-held systems," says Walsh. In 1985, whenthe certification system was set up, there wereonly two on-site systems, and they weretabletop, not hand-held. They requiredtechnicians who were skilled and sophisticated."We were concerned about some constructionsupervisor running around with one of these inthe back of a pickup truck testing people," hesays.Interestingly, it is the unions who really likethe federal guidelines, Walsh notes. "Theunions feel very comfortable with mystandards," he says with a wry laugh.But Evans notes that many employers can'tcomply with the HHS guidelines. "They're tooexpensive and complicated," he says. "On-siteis cheaper, it's more convenient, it's easier."If the employer is planning to take action, thetest should be confirmed in a licensed lab,says Evans. "Most states have got some lawregulating labs."COSTS OF TESTINGWalsh says the per-test cost fromSAMHSA-certified labs has come downdrastically. "Most of the labs now charge inthe neighborhood of $15 to $20 a specimen,"says Walsh. What about the cost of collectionand MRO services? Allen says SAPAA canrecommend a third-party administrator who cando collection, testing, and MRO work for under$50 a test. (Initial setup costs would probablybe about $500 in addition, depending on thecomplexity of the policy, he says.)THE LIABILITY MYTHPressed to explain why they recommend followingthe federal testing guidelines even when it'snot required, many people ultimately admit itis fear of lawsuits."The DOT along with GC/MS has been through thecourt system," says Allen. If an employer firesa worker for a positive test and hasn'tfollowed this system, the employer might beopening himself up to liability, these peoplesay. "If you get rid of someone, he might sueyou for hundreds of thousands of dollars," saysSAPAA's Allen."There's not a lot of liability in drugtesting," counters Evans. "There's this myththat employers will be liable." In the one casein which an employer did lose hundreds ofthousands of dollars, Southern Pacific had been"beastly" to the employee, says Evans, clearlygoing out of its way to defy the San Franciscoanti-testing ordinance.TECHNO-PHOBIA AT WORKAnother problem for employers, says Evans, isthe fact that drug testing involves scientifictechnology, which is unusual in the workplace.This techno-phobia is "like math phobia," hesays. "So instead, they seize on the idea thatthere are too many legal problems."Finally, Evans says even the gold standard,GC/MS, won't solve all your problems. "GC/MSisn't perfect," he says. "It's very complex.

Stay tuned!Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE via NewsNetMay 1, 1994DRUG TESTING OF NON-SAFETY-SENSITIVE WORKERS UPHELDIn one of the most recent of California'sseminal drug-testing rulings, an appeals courthas ruled that an employee who refused to takea drug test was guilty of misconduct andtherefore did not qualify for unemploymentcompensation. In handing down its ruling March9 in AFL-CIO v. the California UnemploymentInsurance Appeals Board (93 Daily JournalD.A.R. 3164), the California Court of Appealhas taken the rights of employers to testbeyond the zone of the safety-sensitive jobposition.The case involved David Hayes, who worked on aChevron oil-drilling rig, but not as an oilworker and not employed by Chevron. Hayes wasemployed as a housekeeper by a company whichwas under contract with Chevron to maintain theliving quarters for oil workers. The companyrequired all of its employees to have an annualphysical, which included a drug test. When thephysical was scheduled, however, he told hissupervisor that he could not take the drug testbecause he knew he would test positive. He hadbeen smoking marijuana while on shore leave.Hayes was fired for refusing to take the test.But he could not receive unemployment becausethe California Unemployment Insurance AppealsBoard said he was discharged for job-relatedmisconduct.The AFL-CIO took the case to court on behalf ofHayes, arguing that what Hayes did off the righad nothing to do with his job, and thereforewas not job-related misconduct. Furthermore,Hayes' job wasn't even safety-sensitive, theAFL-CIO said. The unemployment board was actingcounter to its earlier decisions, in denyingcompensation to someone who did not have adangerous job and who was not suspected ofusing drugs on the job.The court disagreed, saying that work on an oilrig is dangerous, regardless of the job."Although a slip and fall in the kitchen of arestaurant or in a hotel room might notendanger anyone other than the person who fell,on an oil platform a slip and fall could be onoutside stairways or areas where the impairedemployee might not only injure himself, butcause others to leave their posts to rescuehim," the ruling states. "Similarly, spillinggrease which could cause a fire might not be somuch of a concern where all other employees canleave the threatened area. In a self-containedarea out in the ocean on an oil derrick, thethreat of fire becomes much more significant."Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE via NewsNetMay 1, 1994SURVEY: OVER ONE THIRD OFEMPLOYERS FIRE AT FIRST POSITIVEAlthough most employers refer workers who testpositive for drugs to an EAP or a treatmentprogram, over one third fire employees for thefirst positive test, a recent survey has found.The positive rate is about 5 percent, accordingto the survey of 183 employers conducted byWilliam M. Mercer.Most of the companies tested for amphetamines,barbiturates, cocaine, hallucinogens, andopiates, according to the survey. Only halftest for alcohol, "even though its prevalenceof abuse far exceeds that of illicit andprescription drugs," says Mercer consultantShael Barger, who is based in San Francisco.Barger strongly believes that testing can beused to identify troubled employees and referthem to treatment. "Drug testing does work, butthere needs to be confidentiality protectionsand access to treatment," she tells DIW.Employees should be encouraged to come forwardif they need help, and returned to theirposition once treated, she says. After acertain point, if an employee is unable tomaintain abstinence, then he may be let go."My concern is to protect the employer fromlitigation," says Barger. But she also isconcerned that substance abuse problems not bedriven underground by punitive methods.Noting that the Americans with Disabilities Actprohibits discrimination against an alcoholic,Barger says it's unfortunate that the statutedoesn't apply to illicit drugs as well. "It isa disease," she says of drug addiction. "I wishthe ADA was as emphatic on illicit drugs asalcohol."If employers send the workers who test positivefor treatment -- as most of surveyed employersdid -- they will benefit, says Barger."Substance abuse can result in work siteaccidents, increased absenteeism and loweredproductivity, all of which carry high pricetags," she says. "Even though a drug screeningprogram detects relatively few substanceabusers, it can still save significant sums byidentifying chemically dependent workers andmotivating them to seek treatment."Of the employers surveyed, 30 percent do nodrug testing at all, citing concerns aboutlegal liability, employee privacy, and testaccuracy.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE via NewsNetMay 1, 1994EAPS NEED TQMTotal quality management, or TQM, a buzz-phraseof the 1980s, is still trying to find its wayinto EAPs. While incorporating the principlesof TQM -- encouraging employee participationand self-esteem, eliminating fear, constantlyimproving service, and providing leadershipinstead of demanding production quotas -- seembeyond the scope of EAP activities, they areimportant to the survival of the EAP, accordingto an article in the March issue of EAPAExchange, the monthly house organ of theEmployee Assistance Professionals Association.Of course, TQM may be too much for externalEAPs -- those which operate on a contract basisfor many different companies, and which oftenaren't enough of a participant themselves intheir client companies to play a role insetting the broad policies that make up TQM.But for internal EAPs, which operate as part ofa company, TQM is necessary, according to thearticle, which is based on a survey of bothinternal and external programs.If EAPs don't get involved in TQM, they may beseen by management -- which pays the bill -- asnothing but a dumping ground for troubledworkers. The next step is for the employer toquestion the value of having an internal EAP atall -- and suddenly, the EAP finds itself outof business in favor of a contract with anexternal vendor. Doing TQM is really a matterof survival, internal EAPs say.CHANGE AT MOTOROLA"If we choose not to integrate with otherareas, we run the risk of being relegated to acorner of the building where we see downtroddenemployees and, eventually, are dropped in favorof an external vendor," says Sheila Monaghan,corporate director of the EAP at Motorola. "Fora time, EAPs operated in a nonintegrated way inorder to have sufficient numbers of employeesusing their services." The nonintegrated systemallowed supervisors to refer -- or send --employees to the EAP whenever they thought itwas a good idea.Under the integrated system, a supervisorreferral is not made until the supervisor hasfirst consulted with the EAP. Perhaps there are"alternative strategies" which could befollowed. The purpose is not to enhance thepower of the EAP, but to create a generalproblem-solving environment involvingmanagement, HR, and the EAP."This means that HR teams need to develop theirown process to interface efficiently in thereferral process," says Monaghan. "When eachteam understands and coordinates the process,together we can further increase our totalefficiency."No stranger to TQM in its non-EAP world,Motorola won the Malcolm Baldrige nationalquality award in 1988.BEYOND COUNSELINGIn general, EAPs are good at more thancounseling: their skills make them experts atinterviewing a supervisor, for example, to findout what the problem is. In this way, internalEAPs are poised to become part of HR. Thismeans letting go of the old way of doingthings, in which the EAP advocated for theemployee, protecting him from HR andmanagement.The advantage of this method is that employeessaw the EAP as a safe haven, and were morelikely to confide in it. The disadvantage wasthat the EAP's hands would be tied when it cameto working with HR or management. Ultimately,management found that subsidizing counselingfor its problem workers was not acost-effective goal for its EAP.Even EAPs which are more focused on counselingemployees than on management and HR can play animportant role in TQM, says Dan Conti, Ph.D.,EAP director at the First National Bank ofChicago. Outcome measurements for behavioralhealth care -- psychotherapy and substanceabuse treatment -- are especially important toConti, whose EAP does managed care as well.Determining whether treatment works is one wayto incorporate the "spirit" of TQM into theEAP-managed care combination, an increasinglypopular mix. "We're interested in much morethan a satisfaction survey that asks, `Are youhappy with your provider?,'" he says."Sophisticated outcome measurement can drivereal quality improvement -- that is, treatmenteffectiveness -- for an EAP-managed caresystem.Another key to EAP TQM is understanding thecustomer. The customer is the company --management and HR -- who is buying the EAP. Theemployee is not the customer, he is the user.Is TQM out of the question altogether forexternal EAPs? It better not be, according toTerry Cowan, executive director of WorkersAssistance Program, based in Austin, Texas.External EAPs like his shouldn't expect tosimply get referrals, says Cowan, who has seenthe many external EAPs swallowed up byinsurance companies to perform managed care."We see ourselves in survival mode right now,"he says. His advice to internal EAPs who don'twant to be replaced by externals: sit in atevery upper-level management meeting and be apart of all management decisions.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE via NewsNetMay 1, 1994COMING UP----Alcohol Testing Conferences: The Drug andAlcohol Testing Training Institute is holding athree-location series of conferences--sameagenda, different sites--this spring andsummer.

Gregory and Howe, alaw firm specializing in management consulting,has arranged for a drug-testing program for itsclients which improves their chances oflowering their workers' compensation rates."It's been proven that when companies put acomprehensive drug-testing program in place,their claims are reduced dramatically," saysGeorge Howe, a principal at the Shelton,Connecticut-based firm.It does require an "enlightened" insurancecompany to give a discount in exchange for drugtesting, Howe admits.  "AIG is familiar withGregory and Howe's program. They know it'scomprehensive, and they can validate that thecompany they're underwriting is doing thetesting," he says.The fact that an outside firm -- Gregory andHowe -- is running the testing program is veryimportant to an underwriter, says James Hughes,president of Windsor Insurance, a broker whoworks with the law firm and with AIG. "One ofthe things AIG says is that it's great to havea drug-testing program, but they want to makesure it has some bite to it," Hughes tells us.Discounts come in one of two ways, says Howe.First, if an insurance company is convincedthat a drug-testing program will drasticallyreduce workers' compensation claims, therecould be a 10 percent reduction at the start.More likely, however, is the "gain-sharing"program. "It's like profit sharing," Hughessays. "Let's say we go in and check out thecompany with AIG, and agree the annual premiumis $300,000. We'll handle claims payment andreview, and we can reduce the costs. We may beable to reduce the costs by $100,000, and thatsavings would then be shared by AIG and theemployer." The broker uses managed care andfraud detection to reduce claims costs.Drug-testing is done also.In order to qualify for a workers compensationdiscount from AIG, an employer would have toconduct random and pre-employment drug testing,says Hughes. In addition, a third party -- notthe employer -- would have to oversee thedrug-testing program to make sure "it's donecorrectly," he says.For Howe, "correctly" means followingDepartment of Transportation protocol: usinglabs certified by the Substance Abuse andMental Health Services Administration, using aMedical Review Officer to interpret allpositives, and following federal collectionguidelines. Howe says the DOT system is themost legally sound. With the DOT system, "if adisgruntled employee wants to take actionagainst a company, he won't be able to takethem to court," Howe says.The medical review officer protects theemployee from being labeled a drug user when heis using only prescription drugs, says Howe."Almost weekly we have an opiate positive thatis reversed for dietary or medical reasons," hesays.Although Gregory and Howe contracts withlaboratories and has a Medical Review Officer,it is more than a third-party administrator,says Howe. "There are a lot of TPAs or MROorganizations that try to sell their serviceslike they're selling laser beams," he says. "Westart at the top, with the policy." But thisdoesn't mean that turnaround time is slow."With us, you get good turnaround time -- 24hours for negatives, and 48 to 72 hours forpositives."PER-TEST COST: $55What is the cost of Gregory and Howe's program?Billing is simple: about $55 per test. Theprogram setup and administration is built intothe per-test cost. Gregory and Howe alsohandles the paperwork--test results are kept onemployees at the law firm. "You're dealing withan individual's livelihood," says Howe. "So ifan auditor wants to see files, we have them."As for AIG, the need for antidrug programs interms of workers compensation was driven homeby a recent case in which a man fell off aladder and broke his arm -- normally about$3,000 in  claims, says Hughes. But the man'sarm wouldn't heal properly. "It was determinedthat the reason it wasn't healing was becausethe man was a drug user -- an addict," saysHughes. The workers' compensation board ruledthat the employer had to pay for inpatientsubstance abuse treatment as part of theworkplace injury. "AIG knows the benefits ofhaving workers who are off drugs," says Hughes."But they like to see a comprehensive program."Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE via NewsNetMay 1, 1994PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION OFFERSMODEL DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE LAWSThe President's Commission on Model State DrugLaws, which spent most of last year holdinghearings on state legislation needed to dealwith drugs in different arenas, has come upwith six different model acts, as follows:*  Drug-Free Private Sector Workplace Act;*  Drug-Free Workplace Workers' CompensationPremium Reduction Act;*  Employee Assistance Programs andProfessionals Act;*  Drug-Free Public Work Force Act;*  Drug-Free Workplace Act; and*  Employee Addiction Recovery Act.The purposes of the proposed laws is to reducethe costs of medical claims, medicaldisability, injuries, theft, absenteeism, anddecreased productivity associated with abuse.The proposed laws also would help employees gettreatment. The statutes would:  *Require a drug-free workplace program toinclude written policies, EAPs orrehabilitation resources, employee education,supervisor training, drug testing, laboratorystandards, and provisions for employeeconfidentiality.*  Protect private employers from litigationfrom a good-faith employee drug test, if theemployers have a comprehensive drug-freeprogram.*  Provide for a 5 percent reduction inworkers' compensation insurance premiums foremployers with comprehensive drug-freeworkplace programs.*  Allow addicted or alcoholic public-sectoremployees to get treatment without job loss.*  Allow termination or probationaryemployment for any public-sector employee whois convicted of a criminal drug offense.*  Require all contractors, subcontractors, andgrantees doing business with or for the stateto have comprehensive drug-free workplaceprograms.*  Set up a state licensing entity for EAPprofessionals.*  Give employers a tax credit equal to 50percent of what they paid for treating anemployee for alcohol or drug abuse.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE via NewsNetMay 1, 1994BORG-WARNER GUARDS TESTED AS APPLICANTSBorg-Warner Security Corporation, which ownsWells Fargo Guard Services and BurnsInternational Security Services, does drugtesting on a pre-employment basis only. Butwith 65,000 security guards as employees and ahigh turnover rate, this is a lot of testing.It's done with an on-site test called the MACHIV, which screens for cocaine, heroin,marijuana, and methamphetamines.If the MACH IV is positive, the sample goes toa lab for confirmation, says Joe Allen, aspokesman for the Chicago-based Borg-Warner.There's a lot of "self-selection" that goes onwith pre-employment testing, says Allen.

The certificationprogram may be headed for the Food and DrugAdministration or the Health Care FinancingAdministration.J. Michael Walsh, Ph.D., who wrote theguidelines when head of the drug-testingprogram at the National Institute on DrugAbuse, has suggested that the FDA would be abetter place than SAMHSA for the NationalLaboratory Certification Program, which heestablished. In any event, the certificationprogram won't go back to NIDA, which is nowpart of the National Institutes of Health, andnot involved with regulation. The next move isup to the Department of Health and HumanServices, which oversees the FDA, HCFA, SAMHSA,and NIH."I really do think HHS has got to dosomething," says Walsh, who has been aworkplace drug-testing consultant in Bethesdasince leaving the federal government a yearago. "The whole program is hanging up in theair now. And there isn't a good understandingof how much the private sector relies on it."While Walsh has no criticism of the way SAMHSAis running the certification, he says there isa big problem with lack of funding and lack ofinterest. "It's not a high priority now," hesays. As proof, he offers the long-awaitedfinal rule amending the testing guidelines,which would lower the cutoff level formarijuana screens, require Medical ReviewOfficers to be independent from laboratories,and make other changes in the protocols. "It'sso long overdue it's ridiculous," says Walsh,who contends the changes should have been madefour years ago. "There's nothing controversial,but someone has to sign it," he says. "I neverthought that it would take so long" forregulatory changes to follow changes intechnology, he adds. The changes aren't merelyformalities, Walsh notes. Lowering the cutofflevel to 50 nanograms per milliliter formarijuana screens "would triple the positives,"he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE via NewsNetMay 1, 1994CHANGES IN SAMHSA LAB LISTThere are two changes in the list oflaboratories certified by the Substance Abuseand Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA) to conduct drug tests for regulatedemployers and the federal government.*  Mayo Medical Laboratories in Rochester,Minnesota withdrew voluntarily from theNational Laboratory Certification Program onApril 15.*  Doctors & Physicians Laboratory is nowSmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratory.

After hereturned from treatment and the company'sMedical Review Officer cleared him to return towork, the company worked out a last-chanceagreement with him which clearly stated thathis next positive test for drugs or alcoholwould result in his termination. At thismeeting, LaGard declined union representation.But less than a year later, LaGard again testedpositive for cocaine. The company fired him,and the union cried foul.*If the first positive test wasn't grounds tofire the worker, then neither was the secondpositive test.*In negotiating directly with LaGard, ColumbiaGas violated the collective bargainingagreement, making the last-chance agreementinvalid.*Union and management never agreed that twopositive tests are justification for discharge.The company rebutted that it did have the rightto fire the worker.*Had it so desired, Columbia Gas could havefired him after the first positive test; justbecause it waived its right to do so doesn'tmean it can't do so after the second.*Firing the worker is necessary to upholdpublic policy, which is rooted in protectingthe safety of the public.*LaGard said he didn't want unionrepresentation at the meeting during which thelast-chance agreement was negotiated.The ruling: LaGard stays fired, ruledArbitrator James C. Duff in a January 31decision. The deciding factor, the refereesaid, was "proper cause." When a worker isemployed in a safety-sensitive job, as LaGardeven admitted he was, and when that workertwice tests positive for drugs, he has noguarantee of his job, according to the ruling.And the arbitrator was impressed by the factthat the worker had been given the chance to goto treatment. "Nothing guarantees that multipletreatment and/or rehabilitation opportunitieswill be afforded to multiple offenders," saidDuff.The idea that if a single positive test meritstreatment instead of firing, then so should thesecond positive, is "too strained to beaccepted," he said, noting that the employeehad been clearly notified that his nextpositive test would not be followed by the samedegree of tolerance. As for the validity of the last-chanceagreement, LaGard lost his right to argue thiswhen he declined union representation at themeeting, the arbitrator said. Furthermore, thefact that there was "proper cause" for thetermination made the claim of invalidity moot.(Case not yet reported.)Back to Headline List WT03-B08-13IA087-000634-B047-275http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/mt16.html 205.156.212.5 19970122033634 text/html 19629HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:34:40 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:45 GMTContent-length: 19442Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/mt16.html Sample Issue Copyright EMPLOYEE RELATIONS IN ACTION via NewsNet May 1, 1994 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES WHEN DO A GROUP OF EMPLOYEES CONSTITUTE A `CREW'?

Thatbrought the union running with a grievancedemanding that Rolidack return to thethree-workers-per-shift policy.At an arbitration hearing, the union argued:1. Our union contract guarantees the existenceof a protected crew size--a minimum of three inthe case of Mould Dipping Laborers.2. The elimination of the third worker hasplaced too great a strain on the remaining twoworkers.3. Furthermore, management has not justifiedthe removal of the third worker on the basis ofsignificant changes in the job.A Rolidack official responded:  *  Because of the varying kind of work doneby the Mould Dipping Laborers, we have neverconsidered these workers to compose a protected"crew."  *  Moreover, recent changes in the jobsupport the removal of one employee from thiswork.RULINGThe Mould Dipping Workers do not compose a'crew' and the company can change their numberat its own discretion, ruled Arbitrator ThomasJ. McDermottThe referee held:"The number of Mould Dipping Laborers workedper (shift) has varied from 1 to 3 and on a fewoccasions to 4. No relationship was shownbetween the changes in numbers that have takenplace and any given set of workingconditions.Thus, it can only be concluded thatthis job has been scheduled on the basis ofwhat was determined to be the work load. Thereis absent, therefore the proof that a protectedwork crew...has existed." (46 LA 733)COMMENTIn another ruling, the same arbitratordeclared:"Most arbitrators hold...that a crew forpurposes of local working conditions existswhere the employees making up the work forcehave a relationship that is interdependent ofeach other. This would mean that, when onemember is removed or absent, the remainingworkers are required to assume an increasedamount of work, or there is a significantchange in the type of work they are required toperform.

He was attractedby the possibility of early retirement underthe Social Security Act in conjunction with apension from Carvian.Mack took early retirement after consulting hisForeman and Henry Galt, the company's PersonnelManager. Both assured him that he would receivea monthly retirement check from Carvian for$220.78. Mack's first retirement check was inthat amount and he was again assured by Galtthat the figure was correct.However, the next month Mack received a checkfor $110.39. When Mack demanded an explanation,an embarrassed Henry Galt admitted that theoriginal check for $220.78 was an error; thefigure should have been $110.39.At an arbitration session called to considerMack's grievance, the pensioner's unionadvocate expounded:1. Gerald Mack, a faithful, longtime employeerelied implicitly upon the representations madeto him by his foreman and Personnel ManagerGalt that he would receive  a certain sum inretirement which would make it feasible for himto cease working.2. This turned out to be an irresponsiblemistake, which makes it difficult for him tocover his retirement living expenses.The company's Personnel Manager answered:  *  Mistakes in pension figures occasionallyoccur in processing retirement requests.  *  These are inadvertent errors and shouldnot be made binding on the employer.Did The Employee Win?

The union'sdemand was adamantly rejected by Vansellor andboth sides soon squared off before anarbitrator. At the hearing, the employermaintained:1. A security officer like Lowery is held to ahigher standard than other workers because hecarries a weapon and has authority over people.Lowery was arrested for a crime of violence. Wecan't take the risk of permitting him tocontinue on duty.2. To permit a security employee, who is underarrest, to remain at his post would cause usgreat embarrassment among our clients.Lowery's union advocate insisted:  *  During his 6 years as a SecurityProtection Officer at Vansellor, Lowery hasbeen an excellent employee and has receivedhigh performance evaluations from hissuperiors.  *  Vansellor did not conduct anyinvestigation of the charges made againstLowery, nor produce any evidence he is guiltyof the offense.  *  There was little publicity about Lowery'sarrest - and Vansellor has suffered little, ifany, embarrassment.

He could find no proof thatthere was widespread public knowledge ofLowery's arrest--or that his co-workers werereluctant to work with him. The arbitrator wasalso impressed by the fact that Lowery hadreceived disparate treatment in that  othersecurity personnel who had been charged withmore serious crimes were not disciplined. (94-1ARB Par.4100)COMMENTWhere an employee is arrested at the work sitefor committing a crime, the employer is facedwith two options. If the employer finds thatthe offense calls for discipline, it canproceed to prove its case  in the same way asif the employee were charged with industrialmisconduct. On the other hand, the employer canleave the matter to the courts and reservefinal decision until the verdict is rendered.Bear in mind that if an employer decides tosuspend the employee, it must be able to provethat keeping the employee on the job pending acourt decision, would have an adverse impact onits operations.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMPLOYEE RELATIONS IN ACTION via NewsNetMay 1, 1994WHEN DOES AN EMPLOYEE BECOME PERMANENTLY ANDTOTALLY DISABLED?What Happened: While cutting torque convertersin the course of his job with the NedicrodeCorporation, Edward Fowler reached up to pull aconverter from a pallet. The act caused him tofeel a burning sting and to pass out.Fowler was hospitalized and treated by variousneurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons. Heunderwent operations which, among otherresults, led to the removal of the disc aroundthe nerve in his lower spine. Despite all thetreatment rendered to him, Fowler was oftenracked  by severe pain.Fowler pressed a claim for Workers'Compensation and was awarded permanent andtotal disability benefits. While concedingFowler's entitlement to Workers' Compensation,Nedicrode's insurance company challenged hisright to total benefits. Both sides wound up ina courtroom, where Fowler's lawyer set forth:1. The physicians and vocational experts whohave examined and treated Fowler unite indeclaring that he is 100% vocationally disabledbecause of his pain. He will never again  beable to do the only work he was trained toperform.2. There is no choice but to grant himpermanent and total disability benefits.The insurance attorney replied:  *  If he tried, Fowler could find employmentother than that he performed prior to hisaccident. He could be retrained to handlelighter jobs. After all, he has no restrictionson walking or driving.  *  It is unreasonable to place a relativelyyoung person such as Fowler into virtualretirement on full benefits.     Was The Insurance Carrier Right?  YES  qNO  qRULINGFowler is entitled to permanent and totaldisability benefits, ruled the Alabama Court ofCivil Appeals. Fowler's case was stronglybolstered by testimony from physicians andvocational experts as to the incurable andrelentless pain visited upon him by hison-the-job accident. The court brushed asidethe insurance carrier's argument that Fowlershould explore possibilities of alternativeemployment."The test for total disability is the inabilityto perform one's trade, and if so unable, thenthe inability to obtain other reasonablygainful employment. The employee is notrequired to be absolutely helpless or suffertotal disability. Gainful employment meansemployment similar in remuneration to thatearned prior to the injury (and) compatiblewith the employee's pre-injury occupation, age,education and aptitude," the tribunal held.(630 So.2d 471)COMMENTIn an earlier decision, an Alabama court ruled"An employee who is so injured that he canperform no services other than those which areso limited in quality, dependability, orquantity that a  reasonable stable market forthem does not exist, may well be classified astotally disabled."

See you Monday,' repliedSchultz.Stratton looked better on Monday--until helearned that several members of his unit hadbeen asked to work overtime on the previousSaturday."Why wasn't I asked,too?" Stratton asked hissupervisor in an injured tone."You were out sick. You weren't in shape towork."Stratton was so angry that he filed a grievancedemanding that he paid for the overtime deniedhim. When the issue reached arbitration,Stratton fumed:1.The union contract says that all employeesare entitled to an equal crack at overtime.2. Although I was sick on Friday, it didn'tmean that I was unwell on Saturday. A telephonecall to my home by the supervisor would havemade that clear.A company factotum riposted:  *  When an employee calls in sick, we assumethat he's out of commission - until he tells usotherwise.  *  It's unreasonable to expect a supervisorto call up employees who are at home sick everytime we have to get up a group for overtimework to check up if they're well enough to comein.  Was The Compnay Right?  YES  q  NO  qRULINGNo overtime money for Stratton, ruledArbitrator Raymond Goetz. There is a reasonablebasis for assuming that an employee who is outsick is unavailable for overtime, thearbitrator pointed out. Furthermore, the needfor overtime usually arises shortly before thework is to be performed. A company cannot beexpected to phone absent employees to come infor work on short notice. The logical step isto ask the employees who are on hand to do theextra work. (72-2 ARB Par., 8459)COMMENTThe outcome might have been different ifStratton had known about the overtime and hadtelephoned in to his supervisor to volunteerfor the work. The arbitrator suggested thatthen the employer would have been on noticethat the employee was able to work overtime.RULINGNo merit raise for Glenn Collier, ruledArbitrator Neil M. Gundermann. The umpireopined:"The Progress Review Form did not indicate thatthe employee was performing in a manner whichwould support a merit increase. To receive suchan increase there must be real merit--greateroutput, handling of more difficult assignments,greater effort or some manifestation of greatervalue to the company. A merit increase is notdue merely with the passage of time." (67-1 ARBPar. 8217)COMMENTWhat won this case for the company is thatmanagement was able to show that it had a true"Merit Progress" procedure. The employees wererated every six months--not haphazardly--but inface-to-face talks with their supervisors. Goodand bad points were discussed and supervisorsencouraged employees to ask questions on howthey could improve.Back to Headline List WT03-B08-14IA087-000634-B047-318http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/mt21.html 205.156.212.5 19970122033701 text/html 86769HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:34:55 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:45 GMTContent-length: 86582Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/mt21.html Sample Issue Copyright HUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNet January 1, 1995 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES QUARTERLY APPRAISALS REPLACE NATWEST'S ANNUAL PAY REVIEW (1001 words) NEWS BRIEF CENTRAL BANK NEEDS TO CUT JOBS (132 words) RAPID GROWTH IN SALARIES FOR UK MANAGERS (114 words) FIRST UNION ABANDONS COMBINED SALESFORCE (173 words) STANDARD CHARTERED TO CUT STAFF (132 words) SWISS RE TAKES DERIVATIVES STAKE (92 words) VOLUNTARY WORK BENEFITS EMPLOYEES (182 words) ATMS ON THE RISE IN JAPAN (82 words) BUILDING SOCIETY STAFF OPT FOR REDUNDANCY (242 words) FRANCE: REFORM OF BANKING HOURS FALLS THROUGH (514 words) FRANCE: UAP FAVOURS PART-TIMERS (233 words) STAFF SUPPORT SCHEMES CATCH ON WITH INSURERS (233 words) PORTUGAL: BPSM'S OVERSTAFFING CURE: MORE BRANCHES (521 words) CONSULTANTS ARGUE FOR FLEXIBLE BENEFITS (964 words) PUTTING AN END TO RECRUITMENT HASSLE?

So the bank started a new programme,"valuing individual performance", which is aimed at identifyingemployees' development needs, possible training courses and otheractivities. The programme applies to all staff every three months."When we talk about people's developmental needs we would seekopportunities in their current roles to develop their skills," Mooresaid.Running along side "valuing individual performance" are "individualperformance plans" which set out what the individual should be tryingto achieve. "We are moving away from saying that the only thing that isimportant is profit and increasing our focus on corporate health,"Moore said."Individual performance plans" use balanced business score cards.Similar score cards are also used for business units within the NatWestgroup and for the group itself. "The individual performance plansshould be feeding into that," he said.The balanced score card seeks results and achievements in four areas:financial; customer service; quality; and organisational development."Organisational development is about how you manage and motivate tohelp our staff perform," Moore said. "There are quality targets at eachbranch and we use a customer service index and mystery shoppers to testthe level of service in each branch."If everyone is performing according to their individual plan that willhave an upward effect on the organisation. The totality of their inputwill lead to improved organisation. The objective is to furthermotivate that totality."NatWest admits that a three-monthly appraisal system costs much more interms of paperwork, time and money, as an annual review - but Moorebelieves the approach is more cost effective."It is more valuable to us," he said. "The only way to get sustainablemarket advantage is through the collective achievement of your staff.Under the old annual review system people often forgot towards the endof the year what happened in the first three months. There are hugeefficiencies in our new system because it's forward looking, it helpsus plan our training and development schedule. In 1994 we were lookingahead to our human resource needs for 1995."Alan Ainsworth, assistant secretary of the Banking, Insurance andFinance Union, admitted that "in crude terms the system is very good".But the trade unionist believes there are problems with itsimplementation."If people are in an office that has very tight staffing levels thereare problems finding time appraisal," Ainsworth said. "There is also aproblem with people not understanding the system - both staff andmanagers. Under the old system, if you got a high score, you knew thatwould be reflected in your pay rise. People don't see how the newsystem relates to their pay packet."The new system is so vague that no one is comfortable with it. Staffare used to managers telling them what to do, they are not used tomanagers talking about it."Despite trade union misgivings, Moore claims the system is popular withNatWest's workforce. "Our internal surveys show that our 55,000 staffhave welcomed this," he said. "They see it as something that isdevelopmental and training orientated. It is very important to themthat they continually update their skills and it's very healthy for theorganisation to have staff in a developmental frame of mind."NatWest also claim that the quarterly staff appraisal has helped teamwork. "We wanted to encourage local teams and managers by getting adialogue going between individuals and their line managers," saidMoore. "'Valuing individual performance' encourages line managers tohave conversations about staff development as part of their day to dayactivities and it makes our managers more coaching orientated."Though the new quarterly appraisal system applies to all staff, NatWestis continuing to use its old system of measuring competencies amongsenior managers."At NatWest group we are quite well advanced in our understanding anduse of competencies which we have developed over 40 years," Moore said."We have identified 11 critical competencies needed by a quite a smallpercentage of high performance managers which differentiates units interms of performance. The real ideal is understanding them and relatingthem to individual performance. Research has shown that most highlysuccessful managers are good at two or three competencies- but they know which they are good at and play to their strengths."After identifying individual strengths and weaknesses we do not goabout a remedial exercise. It's important to find out what people aregood at, then get them better at that. To use a sporting analogy, ifyou have a good goal scorer in a football team, you do not starttraining him to be a goalkeeper, you work at making him a betterstriker. You organise teams so that they have a range of skills betweenthem. A team where people have different strengths and competencieswill always perform better than a team of all rounders."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995CENTRAL BANK NEEDS TO CUT JOBSFRANCE'S CENTRAL bank needs to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs in thenext five to ten years, according to an external report by consultingfirms McKinsey, Bernard Bruhnes and Gide Loyrette Nouel.The report commissioned by the governors of the Banque de France, hassowed fear among the current staff of 16,500.The consultants claim the move is needed if the Banque de France is tobecome as competitive as other European central banks.

"The saleswere not as high as expected," a spokesman said. "In the future, wewant to go after the trust side of the business more aggressively."The bank plans to refocus its PICs exclusively on brokerage sales andwill recruit an entirely new salesforce of 75 dedicated trustprofessionals between now and January 1995.

A bank spokesman said it hasalready shed about 1,000 staff in India and Africa using voluntaryredundancy schemes."We are selling off non-core assets," the spokesman added. "It is apositive move as far as the business and shareholders are concerned."The 10 percent cut in Standard Chartered's workforce is aimed atcutting running costs in the medium term.

But now,they are beginning to see the training benefits too. NationalWestminster Bank is one of a group of companies which are trying tofind a method of measuring these benefits.Action claims that temporary charity assignments for junior andmiddle-managers may be a way of solving the problem of how to givestaff a taste of responsibility in today's flatter organisations.TSB uses charity work as a key part of its management trainingprogramme and candidates for promotion are encouraged to take part inshort-term projects, such as helping charities to draw up businessplans. The bank thinks charity work is also a way of developingleadership skills - in an environment where most people are volunteers,dictatorial management does not work, volunteers need to be coached,encouraged and motivated.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995ATMS ON THE RISE IN JAPANAUTOMATIC TELLER Machine (ATM) branches in Japan are expected tooutnumber staffed branches at 11 city banks by the end of 1995.Unmanned branches are likely to increase by 428 to 3,922 by the end ofMarch.

President of the board of trade MichaelHeseltine has said he will not refer the planned move to the Monopoliesand Mergers Commission.The societies hope to reduce staff numbers after the merger throughnatural wastage - but, according to their staff associations, manyemployees are hoping to benefit from the voluntary redundancy packageson offer.Two factors are given for the popularity of the redundancy schemes: thepackages on offer are generous, for example, Leeds staff who succeed involunteering for redundancy would receive two and a half times theirannual salary in a lump sum; and with overall numbers employed in thebuilding society sector increasing, many staff feel they will easilyfind employment elsewhere.The members of both societies will vote on the merger proposal thisspring. If it goes ahead, there is already speculation that a furthermerger with TSB Group may be in the offing. The advantage of such amove is that it would immediately give the Halifax a large number ofnew current account holders who do not yet have a relationship witheither building society.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995FRANCE: REFORM OF BANKING HOURS FALLS THROUGHA MUCH hoped for reform of bank opening hours in France has collapsedafter all five unions involved failed to agree with the proposals.Talks on the issue lasted for almost a year, and at one stage, abreakthrough seemed likely (see HRBI 17).Since 1937 French bank opening hours have been restricted by a decreelimiting freedoms that banks elsewhere take for granted. For example:shift working is restricted - 9 am to 5 pm is still the general rule;and many banks are barred from opening on Saturdays.The restrictions applied to members of the Association Francaise desBanques (AFB). But three key players in France's financial sector arenot AFB members and so are not limited by the decree.These are: CCP, the banking arm of La Poste, which opens 59 hours aweek and employs shift workers; Credit Agricole which was originally afarmers' bank and was given greater flexibility to serve ruralcustomers; and the co-operative and savings banks, which were notregarded as full banks in 1937.The AFB argues that its member banks are losing business to thosefinancial institutions which are exempt from the decree. In the lastten years savings banks have expanded steadily, while AFB members havebeen forced to rationalise and cut jobs.The decree could have been annulled by the labour minister using lawsaimed at removing job creation barriers. Instead, he called on thebanks to negotiate with the unions.But the talks got off to a poor start. Early on two unions, theConfederation Generale du Travail (CGT) and Force Ouvriere (FO),launched anti-reform campaigns that painted a picture of employeesworking around the clock, seven days a week. This left the AFB withonly three unions with which to negotiate: the managers' union, theSNB/CGC; the CFDT; and the CFTC. These unions, refusing to discuss arepeal of the 1937 decree, said they would only consider its revision.After a brief deadlock, the AFB agreed to discuss revision and a30-month trial period ending in November 1997 was agreed. The threeunions said if the trial lead to job creation it would becomepermanent, while the AFB offered to cut working hours by 20 percent forthose working later than 6 pm.But the proposal collapsed when the CFTC claimed that staff incentiveswere not good enough to guarantee that employee participation wouldindeed be strictly voluntary and the AFB refused to includea"volunteers only" clause in the agreement.The SNB/CGC also wanted more detailed negotiations with individualbanks, a move the AFB said would delay the trial by a year.By December, the AFB's only hope was the CFDT, which still seemed tofavour reform. Additional concessions were given, including one whereemployees received payment for 39 hours' work, while only working a 35hour week. But the final nail in the coffin came on December 15, whenmore than 60 percent of the CFDT's members voted to reject theproposal.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995FRANCE:  UAP FAVOURS PART-TIMERSEUROPE'S SECOND-largest insurer, UAP, has signed a "contract for stateemployment" with the French government.The deal signed by UAP president Jacques Friedmann and labour ministerMichel Giraud means that an agreement made by the company last May tointroduce voluntary part-time working for administrative personnel atUAP will go ahead.The accord aims to put in place a job share scheme that will takeadvantage of the new legislation on part-time work, which UAP said will"increase employment but not reduce the company's volume of work".UAP hopes to create 400 new jobs in 1995 through encouraging existingstaff to work part time or to take "progressive retirement".The company said it hopes, on the one hand, to contribute to thecollective effort to fight unemployment and, on the other hand, tocorrect its "age pyramid" by taking on younger staff who will bring newskills to the company. In the meantime, employees aged over 55 will beoffered a "progressive departure" programme which will allow them topass on their expertise to younger employees through a newlyestablished tutoring system.Always keen to be seen as innovative in matters of human resources, UAPwishes "to demonstrate that job sharing is the way forward, viable onthe ground and beneficial to all involved: the company, the employeesand the group".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995STAFF SUPPORT SCHEMES CATCH ON WITH INSURERSMOST NORTH American insurance companies now have formal staff supportschemes aimed at helping employees overcome personal problems,according to the Life Office Management Association (LOMA).The schemes, described by LOMA as employee assistance programmes(EAPS), are designed to identify and resolve those employee problemswhich may lead to reduced productivity. The problems may bework-related or domestic. According to LOMA, the EAPs address issuesincluding: personal health; marriage and family; money management/debt;alcohol/chemical dependency; legal problems; or job stress.A LOMA survey of 145 US and Canadian life and health insurers foundthat about two-thirds or respondents offered EAPs and saw them as amethod that reduced absenteeism and improved productivity and workquality.Eighty percent of companies which provide EAPs do so through subsidisedcounselling services. More than 90 percent of them also extend theirservices to employees' immediate families.Responsibility for EAPs usually rests with human resources departments,however, the survey found that about 80 percent of the companies withEAPs provide them through outside agencies.According to LOMA, assistance with marital/family problems was the mostcommonly used service, with psychological assistance running a closesecond - particularly for problems related to clinical depression.Alcohol and substance abuse, the original impetus for the developmentof EAPs in the early-1980s, ranked fourth on the list of frequentlyused treatments.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995PORTUGAL: BPSM'S OVERSTAFFING CURE: MORE BRANCHESTHE FIFTH-LARGEST bank in Portugal plans to increase its branch networkby more than 50 percent in the next five years and thus help solve achronic overstaffing problem.Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor (BPSM) is now back in the hands of theChampalimaud family, 19 years after it was nationalised in 1975. BPSM'sformer owners Antonio Champalimaud and his son Luis, now hold 80percent of the bank after paying Esc1,528 ($10) per share for 24.4million BPSM shares. Their bid was considerably higher than theEsc1,300 offered by the only other bidder in the reprivatisation, BancoFinancia.BPSM's return to the Champalimaud empire, which includes one of thecountry's largest insurance group, Cia de Seguros Mundial Confianca,creates the biggest financial group in Portugal.As if this was not enough, Luis Champalimaud, in an interview with theweekly newspaper Expresso, said that a massive expansion programme isplanned for the bank. This covered not only increased credit anddeposits, but also a huge increase in the number of bank branches and acorresponding increase in employees.BPSM currently has about 220 branches, and plans to increase thisnumber by at least a further 130 over the next five years.Raising cash for the expansion programme - the price tag was notrevealed - will be done in three ways according to Luis Champalimaud.Firstly, BPSM will embark on an aggressive campaign to increasedeposits. Secondly, the bank plans a Esc20 billion capital increaseover the next two years. Thirdly, funds from a similar sized capitalincrease in Mundial Confianca will be transferred to the bank.Luis Champalimaud dismissed worries concerning overbanking: "It is truethat in some places there is, or could be, too high a concentration ofbank branches, but at the end of the day it's a case of survival of thefittest - and we are fitter than most."Analysts point out that BPSM has a massive potential network ofbranches at its disposal via Mundial Confianca and add that theconversion of any number of these insurance offices into allfinanzbranches could be done at a minimum cost. "Banco Mello is expanding onthe back of insurer Imperio in precisely this manner," said Jose Freireat Banco Espirito Santo.The move would also aid BPSM's overstaffing problems - when BancoComercial Portugues bid for BPSM last year, it said it would slashBPSM's workforce by at least a third - because existing employees canbe relocated to new branches, avoiding a big and expensive recruitmentcampaign.As Luis Champalimaud said:"We have too many staff at the moment. Thatmeans that we either reduce the number or we find work for them to do.We are opting for the latter."The Champalimaud family is also looking to expand in other areas andhas made public its interest in acquiring the 26 percent indirect stakeheld by Banco Espanol de Credito in Banco Totta & Acores, which thePortuguese government is desperately trying to win back from theSpanish bank.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995CONSULTANTS ARGUE FOR FLEXIBLE BENEFITSFLEXIBLE BENEFIT programmes can help organisations control costs, butmany companies have yet to realise its advantages, according toconsulting firm Towers Perrin.The consultancy says flexibility in benefits is on the increase,particularly when it comes to pensions and company cars, and thefinancial industry is leading the way. But it adds that many companiesare unwilling to make their pay and conditions more flexible - becausethey believe it will increase administrative costs.Towers Perrin's conclusions are based on a survey of 400 UK companiesemploying 2 million staff, carried out in conjunction with theConfederation of British Industry.Helen Freeman, a Towers Perrin principal, said: "Motivations toimplement benefit flexibility centre on either or both of thefollowing: the desire to improve employees' appreciation of thebenefits provided, maximising the value to the company of the amountspent on benefits; and the desire to control benefit costs."Twenty nine percent of the companies in the survey were in thefinancial services industry and Towers Perrin found that in the bankingand insurance sector there is greater employee choice in compensationpackages, particularly when it comes to pensions. For example, 24percent of the financial companies surveyed offered pension benefits ona flexible basis, compared with 17 percent of non-financial companies.This may be because the financial sector has a better understanding ofpensions and greater access to a wider range of pension schemes."Many companies do not consider pensions appropriate for flex and maybe missing an opportunity to address one of the most expensive employeebenefit programmes they offer," Freeman said.When it comes to company cars, 74 percent of financial companiesoffered employees a choice between a car and cash, compared with 62percent of non-financial companies. Eighty percent of financialcompanies allowed employees to chose a higher value car by contributingtowards the cost of it, an option available to only 56 percent ofnon-financial firms."The trend towards flexibility within car and pension arrangements mayreflect the fact that these are often the highest-cost employeebenefits," said Freeman. "Companies may be recognising that, if flex isto have a significant cost-containment effect, these benefits must beincluded."Other areas of possible flexibility within compensation packagesinclude: company parking; subsidised cafeteria; luncheon vouchers;subsidised health club memberships; company gyms; annual healthscreening; dental care; private petrol allowances; travelling expenses;share ownership; group discounts; employee, accident insurance; loans;subsidised mortgages; school fees; company creches; and child carevouchers.The survey found that on-site creches and child care vouchers were theleast popular forms of supplementary benefit offered to employees,available at only 7 percent and 5 percent of companies respectively.Towers Perrin also found that giving employees greater choice abouttheir length of annual holidays is also unpopular, though companies inthe financial sector are a little more flexible on this issue."Few companies allow or intend to allow employees either to buy or sellholidays in exchange for cash or other benefits," said Freeman. "Thismay be because allowing employees to sell holidays is a cash cost tothe company, which may not be made up in increased productivity.However, 57 percent of respondents do allow employees to carry forwardunused holiday (72 percent of financial companies) and 37 percent ofrespondents overall allow employees to take unpaid time off to extendtheir holiday."Reviewing the survey, Freeman concluded: "Cost containment withinprivate medical programmes is emerging as an issue, presumably becauseof recent double-digit increases in health-care costs. Benefits withlittle or no cost to companies (such as parking and supplementaldisability insurance) are increasingly included in benefit programmes."However, despite the increase in benefits flexibility, and in itsperceived advantages, companies continue to express concern.Administrative complexity and cost tops the list of perceiveddisadvantages. This concern must be weighed against the advantages. Itis the experiences of companies who implement flex that will determinewhether a role for this approach is secured more broadly within benefitprogrammes."Another Towers Perrin principal, Marc Hommel, went even further: hesees flexible benefits as one of the main trends in employeecompensation for the future."It is very new. It is going to increase," he said. "I would say the UKis between the US and Continental Europe when it comes to progress inthis area. In the US, there is very high flexibility and choice inbenefits, under the banner of employee empowerment."On the continent, it is right on the other extreme. There, companiesare seen as much more paternalistic. Employees like their employers tomake all sorts of decisions for them. For example, in France, when itcomes to holidays, it is August or nothing. In countries like Germanythe only flexibility on pensions is whether you accept a lump sum or anannuity, there is greater flexibility on pensions in the UK."But we are beginning to see things change on the continent. That isbeing driven by recession and high cost of employment. The employmentcosts currently experienced by European firms is unsustainable."Unions and works councils have been very anti-choice - they are intocollective bargaining and agreements made with works councils inHolland, Germany, Belgium and France cover very senior employees. Butthe workforce is changing and we are seeing an end to the job for life."We are beginning to see larger German companies looking at costcontrol. They want to reduce costs but not loose employee appreciation.Rather than provide all employee benefits en masse, you can offer achoice. Offering choice makes you an attractive employer at very littleextra cost."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995PUTTING AN END TO RECRUITMENT HASSLE?NEW SOFTWARE developed by a Californian company may reduce recruitmentheadaches for human resource executives.Resumix, a world leader in electronic systems used for processingapplication forms and resumes, recently announced partnershipagreements with Oracle, ADP, RAMCO Systems, Integral, Decisis, ESSENCESystems and Worksmart- Technologies.A new Resumix product, known as OpenAccess, was the catalyst for thepartnerships. OpenAccess is a set of flexible computer interface toolswhich help automate and synchronise data exchange between the Resumix'sprocessing systems and other human resource management systems (HRMSs).Resumix spokesman Joseph Hnilo explained that OpenAccess will makedatabases more easily accessible to HR system suppliers. Resumix's ownknowledge base contains over 100,000 rules and concepts related torecruitment in specific industries, he said."The Resumix knowledge base applies an objective standard ofmeasurement to job candidates, and can therefore eliminate thesubjectivity in the selection process," Hnilo said."Our system is not designed to tell people who to hire. But we enablerecruiters to quickly and accurately assess candidates' skills andqualifications - that helps companies save time and money."The Resumix system standardises job applications and resumes bycategorising candidates' previous job titles and assigning numericalvalues to candidates' skills. Client firms can enter their hiring needsinto the Resumix system to find the best matched candidate for aparticular position. It is a process which, according to Hnilo, takesonly minutes.Job candidates' resumes can be scanned into a database using fax orelectronic mail. The system then captures an exact electronic image ofthe resume, making the recruitment process "paperless".Paperless recruitment has decided advantages for human resourcedepartments in large US companies, as many receive thousands ofapplications for hundreds of different jobs every year and each resumemust be kept on file for a set period of time. For example, Californianstate law requires companies to keep resumes for every job applicationfor at least two years.Once a job application has been scanned into the Resumix system, a textfile is created so that it can be transmitted anywhere electronically.The system also automatically extracts information from jobapplications, including listed skills and work experience, without theneed for additional data entry by client companies.Resumix is currently targeting the financial services industry, and itslist of clients includes Bank of America, ITT Hartford, SalomonBrothers, Principal Mutual Life Insurance, Wells Fargo Bank, andAmerican Express.Founded in 1988, the company sold its services mainly to high-techfirms during its first three years of operations. Now its marketincludes the financial services industry, telecommunications companies,universities and colleges and even manufacturers."Banking has a lot of similarities to many of our earlier users," saidHnilo. "Like high tech companies, banking requires a great degree ofskill specificity, from portfolio managers to tellers."Our system can help banks in re-engineering efforts. For example,banks can apply the software internally, to analyse their currentemployees in terms of matching them to future projects and planning."Noting that the bigger international banks are moving aggressively intoAsia and Latin America, Hnilo added: "The system can also be used bybanks or insurers who are expanding into new technology or geographicmarkets, to find staff for their new locations."Because it works with many different data entry systems, ResumixOpenAccess allows recruitment data to be freely imported from HRMSs,E-mail, electronic kiosks, application forms scanning systems, andgroupware such as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange.This versatility attracted its current list of marketing partners,including another Californian company, Oracle, who is a leadingsupplier of human resource solutions. Resumix's OpenAccess will operatewith Oracle's Cooperative Application Initiative (CAI) programme,creating a resume scanning and processing system that will be offeredwith Oracle's HRMS.Oracle's vice-president of Migration Services and Worldwide Alliance,Marc Herbert, said the Resumix partnership will enable his company toprovide "fast and effective management and deployment of humanresources to help companies react quickly and respond appropriately tochanges and opportunities in today's demanding market."Automatic Data Processing (ADP) will market Resumix to interface withits HR software. ADP, America's largest provider of outsourced payrollprocessing services, selected Resumix to enhance its human resourcemanagement systems.ADP's director of Strategic Alliances, Elaine Myrback, said her companywas impressed with "both the functionality of the Resumix system andthe flexibility of its data exchange capabilities".A private company, Resumix posted a 130 percent revenue growth from1992 to 1993, and its financial services base, according to Hnilo, nowstands at"5 percent and growing".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995TAPPING ASIA'S MASSIVE POOL OF TALENBanks and insurance companies may find it easier to recruit bilingualemployees in their fast growing Asian markets, thanks to a databasebeing developed by a US recruitment company.International Career Information (ICI) of New Jersey, claims that itsdatabase of bilingual Asian college students in the US in unique.  Thedatabase holds details on 25,000 undergraduate students from countriesincluding Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia,Indonesia, Korea, Vietnam and Thailand, who are all studying at USuniversities.The database's customers include retail banks Citibank and NationalWestminster Bank, and investment banks such as Bankers Trust andGoldman Sachs.According to ICI's director of operations, Wayne Allen, the databasecan be tailored to meet the companies' specific hiring needs for a feeraning from $1,500 to $3,000. Clients can be provided with a list ofpossible job candidates including details on their natinalities, theireducational achievement and work experience."A bank, for example, can select a certain subject major, such asfinace, computer or technology major," Allen said.  "Once we receivethe criteria from the bank, we can send each qualified student atargeted, proactive notice, making them aware of the bank's interest intheir qualifications".Allen explained that ICI is the international arm of a Japaneserecruitment firm, Recruit Company, and has traditionally kept track ofJapanese graduate and undergraduate students studying in the US.However, duirng the past two years, ICI has widened its remit to trackthe progress of all Asian students in the US.Now the company is developing a database on mid-career executivesinterested in returning to Asia, Alled said.A recent ICI survey of 2,300 Asians studying in the US revealed that alarge majority - 89 per cent - preferred to work for a foreignmultinational rather than an Asian-based firm.  This, according toAllen, creates an opportunity for US and European banks and insurersthat want to recruit the best staff for their new Asian operations.Most of the leading US financial houses, including JP Morgan, MerrillLynch, Citibank and Chase Manhattan, are rushing to establish officesin the fast-growing economies of Singapore, Thailand and China.US insurance companies are also moving agressively into the region.Jeffrey Malkovsky, vice-president and chief financial officer of CIGNAInternational, predicted that Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia andThailand will offer the greatest near-term opportunities for insurancecompanies.Allen contends that ICI is well placed to meet the requirements ofmultinationals in Asia.The company unveiled its database system at the Pan Asia MBA Job Fairlast September in New York, where it linked up a personal computer withone in Singapore.  The cross-Pacific link-up allowed corporaterecruiters in Singapore to interview Asian students attending the jobfair.ICI plans a similar intercontinental link-up at the Pan AsianEngineering and Computer Science Job Fair, which is scheduled forFebruary 24 in San Jose, CaliforniaCopyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995TRAINING KIT KEEPS FUTURE LEADERS INDOORSOUTDOOR PURSUIT exercises have long been recognised as valuabletraining methods, particularly in developing leadership and teamworkingability - but the days of military style exercises in the greatoutdoors may be numbered.Outdoor pursuits are expensive in terms of money and staff time.Another drawback, particularly in the middle of winter, is that notevery prospective business leader reacts favourably to the prospect ofseveral days living in the wilds. Plus there is the risk of losingvaluable staff time through injury or illness caused by exposure to theelements.Now UK consulting firm Martin Thompson Associates has developed a morecomfortable and less costly alternative. It is a large scaleconstruction kit, similar to oversized pieces of Lego or Mecanno, thatcan be used indoors and outdoors.The kit, a collection of plastic pipes, joints, platforms and wheels,weighing 22kg and packed in two bags each measuring 30 x 42 x 55 cm,was originally developed by name partner Martin Thompson two years agoas a way of marketing his consultancy services. Since then, the kit hastaken on a product life of its own."We only expected to sell about 50 a year," Thompson said. "In the lasttwo years, we have sold 500. Our international sales include sales toFrance, Switzerland, Germany, India, Dubai, Hong Kong and Canada."In the UK, the list of clients includes: Abbey National, Barclays,Lloyds Bank, Hill Samuel and Zurich Life.The kit is "all you want from a training resource", said Shaun Lang, atraining centre manager with Yorkshire Bank. "I would unreservedlyrecommend the resource to anyone involved in the training anddevelopment of managers and leaders."Colin Keast of Hill Samuel also described it as "the best #480" thathis firm had spent on a training resource.Thompson has developed six training exercises using the kit, he claimsthat each exercises raises basic leadership and teamwork issues,including: listening, planning, decision making, giving and receivingcommitment.Additionally, Thompson claims that each of the exercises, focuses on aspecific area: customer orientation; team objectives versus individualobjectives; inter-group working; communications; roles of team membersand leader empowerment; and negotiating win/win solutions.For example, one of the exercises, Over The Bridge, calls on a team tobuild a bridge and a vehicle that can pass over it. But teams must beaware of customer needs and wants, and should ideally ask theirtraining facilitator for customer criteria."It is amazing how many teams - particularly those from a marketingbackground - who assume that there may be any limitations on what thevehicle may be use for or what kind of span the bridge must cross,"Thompson said."Typically, people do not ask questions, they doeverything from a straight forward production point of view and have noconcept of what the customer required. In the discussion afterwards,the importance of the customer is really brought home to them."A group discussion lead by a trainer follows each exercise andparticipants are encouraged to spend time individually considering howthe lessons learnt can be applied effectively in their place of work.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995EUROPE: BANK STAFF FALL DOWN ON FUND TRANSFERSBANK BRANCH staff in Luxembourg, the UK and Italy are the mostcompetent in Europe when it comes to arranging cross-border paymentsand money transfers, according to research carried out for the EuropeanCommission.Surprisingly, bank staff in the Netherlands - a country with adistinguished history in foreign trade and whose people aretraditionally regarded as the most multilingual in Europe -scored theworst, with a rating of "below adequate".The survey of 352 branches of 165 banks was carried out by UKconsultancy Retail Banking Research on behalf of the commission, whichwanted to gauge the transparency of banking charges and conditions whenconsumers transfer money from one European Union member state toanother.The commission believes transparency in cross-border banking is vitalto the future of Europe. It stated recently: "The full benefits of thesingle market will only be achieved if it is possible to transfer moneyas rapidly, reliably and cheaply from one part of the [EU] to another."Based on the results of the survey and an earlier one carried out in1993, the commission has decided to introduce a directive in Octoberthat would help regulate the area and improve banks' results in thefield.That directive was opposed by the European Banking Federation, whichwanted the banking community to have its own voluntary code of conduct.But the commission has put its foot down, after Retail Banking Researchfound widespread double charging for cross-border fund transfers.In 36 percent of cases, recipients were charged by intermediary and/orbeneficiary banks, though fund transfer instructions stated that allfees had already been paid by the fund originators.The European Banking Federation's general secretary, Nikolaus Bomcke,claimed that double charging is an unavoidable part of sendinginternational payment. He said most sending institutions warnedcustomers that they could not guarantee that a charge would not belevied on fund receivers. "We do not control the transfer chain," hesaid. "Clearly, there is room for improvement, but I believe stronglyin a market solution."Whether a market solution can solve the dismal performance of Dutchbanks remains to be seen. Banking staff in the Netherlands were foundto be the worst in Europe when it came to general helpfulness. And theywere the second worst when it came to providing customers withinformation about the various options available for transferring fundsacross borders; how long a transfer might take; and how much it wouldcost.The survey found that many Dutch banks "were reluctant to give costinformation to the researcher, since he did not have an account withthe bank".Bank staff in Luxembourg scored the best when it came to providingcustomers with the options available to them, the time it would take tocomplete a transfer; and their overall helpfulness. But, amazingly,"branch staff often misquoted costs. Many misread brochure details,others omitted to mention that an exchange commission was payable".UK branch staff scored the best when it came to quoting charges - butthey benefited from a very simple flat fee charging system, with eachbank's charges ranging from Ecu15 ($18) to Ecu45 for urgent transfers,and Ecu10 to Ecu26 for standard transfers.British banks also warned fund originators that electing to paybeneficiary charges did not guarantee that the amount sent would becredited to the beneficiary's account without further deductions. Onebranch staffer told a researcher "Spanish banks charge the beneficiaryeven if the sender requests to pay all costs.""Virtually all" UK branches said they would be able to trace atransfer, if delays occurred. In many other countries, branch staffdenied that transfers sometimes were lost in the system.When researchers approached bank counters in Belgium, Denmark, Spain,France, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, the first member ofstaff contacted handled the inquiry most cases. Which points to agreater level of staff training and work flexibility in those sevencountries.In the five other EU countries, researchers were more frequentlyreferred to another member of staff, or a specialist department.Researchers were asked to make an appointment to carry out theirtransaction in only three countries - in 5 percent of cases in France,4 percent in Portugal, and 2 percent in Italy.CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT STAFF COMPETENCE, A EUROPEAN COMPARISONCountry    Options   Costs   Time   Helpfulness   Overall AverageBelgium     3.0       3.0     3.2    3.4           3.2Denmark     3.0       3.1     3.1    3.0           3.0France      3.0       3.2     3.4    3.4           3.2Germany     2.9       2.9     2.6    3.4           2.9Greece      2.8       2.5     3.2    3.1           2.9Ireland     3.3       3.1     3.3    3.3           3.2Italy       3.4       3.5     3.6    3.5           3.5Luxembourg  3.7       3.3     4.1    4.0           3.8Netherlands 2.7       2.7     2.5    2.9           2.7Portugal    2.9       2.8     3.1    3.2           3.0Spain       2.2       3.1     3.2    3.3           3.0UK          3.4       3.8     3.6    3.7           3.7EU Average  3.0       3.1     3.2    3.4           3.2Source: Retail Banking ResearchCopyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995MIDLAND GAINS STRENGTH FROM DIVERSITYMidland Bank was singled out for praise by the UK Equal OpportunitiesCommission for its policies aimed at ending discrimination in the workplace. Cian Molloy looks at some of the bank's initiativesCYNICS MAY describe equal opportunity statements as empty words - butnot at Midland Bank where UK regulators have praised its equalopportunity schemes.The bank has a dedicated equal opportunities department with humanresource executives in charge of equal opportunities in gender, raceand disability.There are good business reasons for their approach, according toMidland's equal opportunities executive on race, Andie Constantinides."Equal opportunities is about diversity and reflecting the community,"she said. "The more our staff reflect the community they are workingin, the more they will understand that community and the services thatour customers need."Diversity also helps teams. Decision making is better when the peoplemaking decisions come from different backgrounds. Every individual hastheir own thing to bring to an organisation. The more diverse theindividuals in an organisation, the more diverse the skills andqualities that they will bring."Official Midland policy states: "We seek to employ a workforce whichreflects the diverse community at large, because we value theindividual contribution of people, irrespective of sex, age, maritalstatus, disability, sexuality, race, colour, religion, ethnic ornational origin."We will treat all Midland employees with dignity and respect and wewill provide a working environment free from unlawful discrimination,victimisation or harassment."The bank goes further to state that if any act by an employee breachesits equal opportunities policy, the matter "will be taken seriously, befully investigated, and may be subject to disciplinary procedures".Indeed, Midland has become so competent in investigating cases ofalleged discrimination or harassment, that the bank is now marketingits training courses in investigating complaints of racial and sexualharassment.The bank has its own Disability Equality Action Group which meetsregularly. It is a panel of disabled employees who provide managementwith feedback on issues affecting disabled people.To encourage job applications from members of ethnic minorities Midlandhas been running a fellowship programme since 1991 where final yearcollege students are offered work experience placements during theirsummer holidays. Midland audits its graduate selection process forequal opportunity purposes and in 1993 16 percent of its graduateintake came from ethnic minority backgrounds.At present 5 percent of Midland's domestic workforce are from ethnicminority backgrounds. The bank regularly holds "focus groups" with itsethnic minority staff to identify new initiatives in this area and toget feedback about their experience of working for the bank.The director of the equal opportunities unit, Anne Watts, is also afounder member of a new government-funded initiative, Race forOpportunity, being set up later this year. Race for Opportunity will besimilar to another national initiative, Opportunity 2000, which isaimed at increasing the quality and quantity of women in the Britishworkplace by the end of the century.Midland was also involved in the launch of Opportunity 2000 in 1991.Now women represent 21.5 percent of all managers, compared with only7.5 percent ten years ago.Like most British banks, the majority of Midland's part-time staff arewomen, 96 percent. But even part-timers who fit their hours of workaround school schedules can run into home care or baby-sittingdifficulties during school holidays. Because of this, the bank runsholiday play schemes in 40 different locations dotted around thecountry."Play schemes form a natural extension to the bank's nursery provision,allowing employees to work during school holidays, confident that theirchildren are being looked after in a caring and creative environment,"said Watts. "The rationale is the same as with Midland's nurseries -the recruitment and retention of high calibre experienced staff in acost effective manner."The bank does not subsidise its holiday play schemes, but it providesnursery facilities in partnerships with public sector organisations andstaff, with a satisfactory performance rating, have access to over 100nurseries."Although the strategy is business driven, the implementation is whollychild centred. Children with special needs will be accommodatedwherever possible," said Watts."The provision of nurseries has had an impact on retention of staff. In1989, only 30 percent of women returned after maternity leave, but by1993 this figure had risen to 75 percent. The profile of this groupshows that typically they have worked for the bank for at least tenyears, have received a considerable amount of training and areexperienced and effective employees. This represents retention of avery valuable resource."Five days a year of family leave are available to all employees withemergency caring responsibilities. Family leave covers care of sickchildren and other sick or disabled dependents, recognising that withBritain's ageing population more staff members are caring for elderlyrelatives.As well as getting the best from staff, Midland's equal opportunitiesare also aimed at improving customer service.Midland's marketing department has appointed a manager to developbusiness with ethnic minorities and the bank also runs a trainingcourse for managers to heighten their awareness of ethnic minoritybusiness issues. The bank is also running a pilot scheme in six of itsbranches aimed at improving the service offered to ethnic minoritycustomers.During customer focus training staff are taught how to welcome disabledcustomers and Midland is a member of Britain's Employers Forum onDisability.Induction loop systems have been installed in all of the bank'sbranches to help hearing aid users and copies of customer brochures areavailable in braille, large print, and on audio cassettes versions forthose with loss of vision.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995A COLLECTION OF FAMILIAR TALESJob cuts were again a recurring theme in the financial servicesindustry last year. Cian Molloy looks back at these and other humanresources issues that made the headlines in 1994JANUARYEIGHT SENIOR executives of Gota Bank in Scandinavia were taken to courtby the Bankstodsnamnden, the government's bank support authority.Gota Bank was one of the bank's worst hit by the Scandinavian bankingcrisis and the government was seeking damages for losses caused by poorlending decisions made in 1990.The previous year, the bank support authority had threatened Nordbankenwith similar legal action, but that case was settled out of court.BARCLAYS BANK in the UK implemented its first major compulsoryredundancy scheme in the bank's history.WORKERS AT Spain's fifth-largest bank, Banco Espanol de Credito(Banesto), were promised there would be no drastic job cuts in theforeseeable future.The promise was made by Banesto's new chairman, Alfredo Saenz, afterthe bank was taken over by Spain's central bank at the end of December1993.FEBRUARYUS PRESIDENT Bill Clinton gave his support to calls for internationalagreements strengthening workers' bargaining powers.While on a visit to Europe, Clinton praised the European Social Charterand expressed the view that some of its provisions should be extendedto workers in the Third World. "We must create more jobs," he said."But if more jobs involve giving up standards for which people havefought for in the past, this could be very dangerous. It could resultin the collapse of the middle class or working class in our countries."A THREE-year pay deal was agreed in Ireland between the government, theIrish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Irish Employers andBusiness Confederation.The deal covered bank staff because the Irish Bank OfficialsAssociation (IBOA) is now a member of the ICTU. IBOA general secretaryCiaran Ryan was elected to the ICTU's executive in 1993.The IBOA joined the ICTU following its traumatic strike action in 1992when many IBOA members crossed official union pickets and banks wereable to keep branches open, thanks to new technology. Previously, whileoutside the ICTU, the IBOA had been successful in winning pay increaseshigher than those achieved by unions in other sectors.PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE Company of America launched a multi-mediainteractive training scheme, claiming it would improve staffrecruitment, selection and retention.AMERICA'S SECOND-largest bank, Chase Manhattan, offered a stock optionto all its employees as part of a performance based reward scheme.Every employee were to receive an option on 400 shares, priced $35.50each, but the shares were unavailable for purchase unless certainperformance-based conditions were met.The bank's chairman Thomas Labreque said: "The option grant will alignthe interests of our worldwide staff and stockholders, and provideemployees with a strong incentive to perform at levels that exceedstockholders expectations."MARCHSPAIN'S THIRD-largest bank, Banco Central Hispano (BCH), announced astaff reduction and branch closure programme aimed at cutting runningcosts by Pta85 billion ($700 million) over five years.It is planned that about 3,000 staff will be shed and 400 of the banks2,700 branches will be closed by the end of 1995. The bank was formedin 1991 through the merger of Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamerica.At the time of the merger, the bank employed 31,472 people and analystscalculated that it was overstaffed by as much as 40 percent.Between 1991 and 1994, 750 branches were closed and 5,000 jobs shedthrough early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes.THE NUMBER of Americans who telecommute - work from home usingcomputers linked to their offices - increased to 8 million, double thenumber in 1990.Improved technology, the Los Angeles earthquake, and bad weather on theeast coast of the US were cited as reasons for the increase intelecommuting.APRILUNICE, THE European employers organisation, reckoned that 3,000European companies in the financial sector will be affected by the EUdirective on European Works Councils.The directive affects all companies in the EU which employ more than1,000 staff members with at least 100 staff members employed in asecond EU state.HUMAN RESOURCE managers have little effect on the quality of industrialrelations, according to research by the London School of Economics.After surveying data from the UK's Workplace Industrial RelationsSurvey, researchers Sue Fernie, David Metcalfand Stephen Woodland,concluded that human resource executives" do not improve the climate ofemployee-management relations and probably detract from it".BUT HUMAN resource managers do have a role in preventing employeefraud, according to a director of an international risk managementconsultancy.Chris Barrett of WBK International said that during fraudinvestigations it is often found that staff sense something had beenamiss, but feel they cannot voice their concerns because ofunapproachable management."I'm not advocating a police state," Barrett said, "but simplysuggesting that management should be readily accessible to employees."Barrett also suggested that human resource managers develop bettersystems for detecting changes in employee's personal behaviour,including unexplained new-found wealth or increasingly frequent visitsto casinos. "By far the biggest category of employee fraudster is thepreviously honest employee facing a change in the circumstances oftheir lives," he said.MAYAN HRBI survey of European branch opening hours found that Turkishbanks stayed open longest, averaging 46.9 hours a week.Banks in nearby Cyprus had Europe's shortest opening hours, averagingonly 21.3 hours a week. Swiss banks were ranked second with 42.6 hoursa week, while Poland with 41.9 hours, the Netherlands with 39.1 hours,and the UK with 37 hours, were ranked third, fourth and fifth.PAY RISES for bank staff in the UK were higher than the nationalaverage in the first quarter of 1994.Bank personnel saw their pay packets increase by an average of 2.6percent in the first three months of the year, compared with a nationalaverage for the private sector of 2.4 percent, according to theConfederation of British Industry. The biggest wage increase was atLloyds Bank where the average increase based on merit was 4.5 percent.BANC ONE Corporation in the US announced a plan to cut its runningcosts by hundreds of millions of dollars without resorting to layoffs.Banc One's chairman John McCoy said the bank planned to save $150million in 1994 and $200 million in 1995 by using new technology tostreamline back office operations. But he added that Banc One wouldredeploy staff instead of laying them off. "For example, we see anincreasing demand in retail credit, with a downturn in mortgagefinancing. Therefore, we will move now to redeploy the workforcetowards retail credit, and away from refinancing."JUNEA SPANISH bank was left reeling by head hunters after it lost ten ofits most senior executives.Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) was robbed of some of its most valuableemployees following Banco Santander's acquisition of Banco Espanol deCredito (Banesto).The BBV executives had been seconded for four months to Banesto whileit was being administered by the Bank of Spain. Poaching the BBV staffafter buying Banesto had obvious advantages for Banco Santander as themove caused little disruption to Santander's management hierarchy andthe head-hunted staff all have experience of running the newlypurchased bank.METROPOLITAN LIFE, one of the biggest insurance companies in the US,shed 1,000 of its 13,000 salesforce after being fined $20 million formis-selling life insurance policies.CREDIT LYONNAIS, the troubled French bank, announced plans to shed 10percent of its workforce over three years in a move to boostproductivity. The bank's president Jean Peyrelevade set a target forzero growth in running expenses in 1994.SEPTEMBERITALIAN BANKS were hit by strike action following a break-down in talksbetween employers and trade unions about the financial industry'sannual collective agreement.Assicredito, the bank employers' federation, offered a monthly payincrease of L83,000 ($53), but that was not good enough for the tradeunions who demanded a monthly increase of L128,000 backdated to January1993.THE BRITISH Bankers' Association claimed that banks were no longercutting their branch networks. These conclusions were based on acomparison with 1993 which showed little change. But in the last decadeBarclays had closed 700 branches, Lloyds closed 400, Midland 600 andNational Westminster 700.OCTOBERAMERICAN EXPRESS said it planned to shed 6,000 staff in the next twoyears.The move, which involved compulsory redundancies, was aimed at cuttingthe company's costs by $500 million a year. Most of the staff affected,4,000, were US based. Out of the 2,000 employees being shed worldwide,400 were in Europe working in support functions including legal, publicrelations, and human resource offices.Amex chairman Harvey Golub said: "These efforts will build a stronger,more successful organisation that will move us closer to achieving ourvision of becoming the world's most respected service brand."FORTIS AMEV launched a performance pay scheme for its back officestaff.The Dutch parent of the Fortis insurance and banking group, Fortis AMEValready had a profit share scheme in operation. The new performance payscheme, payable this summer, could be worth up to 15 percent of salaryfor some employees.TSB BECAME one of the first UK financial institutions to switch itsinsurance salesmen from commission-based income to salaries in advanceof new disclosure rules coming into operation in the UK at the start of1995.TSB ALSO said it was closing 17 percent of its branch network over a12-month period. The UK's eighth-largest bank by assets had alreadyclosed 100 outlets in 1994 when it announced that another 200 brancheswere to close to cut its total number of branches to 1,000.John Townsend of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union said hebelieved TSB was aiming to prune its network further to 800 branches.NOVEMBERITALIAN BANKS and trade unions signed a four-year collective agreementafter a long-running industrial dispute.Naturally, both sides claimed victory. Assicredito, the bankers'federation, won concessions on hiring part-time workers, opening hoursand the use of annual bonuses which were brought in line withproductivity and bank profitability. The unions won bonuses for staffwho work Saturdays and an agreement that 12 percent of vacancies wouldbe kept for bank personnel who are "between jobs".ABN AMRO, the biggest bank in the Netherlands, was caught by surprisewhen a leaked report from its works council claimed the bank needed toshed 5,000 staff in the next three years.The bank had said earlier in the year that it planned to shed only2,100 workers in three years or 2,800 workers over four years.STAFF SUGGESTIONS at Midland Bank saved the company #250,000 ($400,000)in one year, it was revealed after the bank's suggestion scheme wonpraise from the UK's Industrial Society.THE SPANISH insurer AGF-Union y el Fenix said it needed to shed 35percent of its workforce as part of its recovery plan.The company was faced with a great deal of staff duplication followingthe merger of AGF Seguros and Union y el Fenix in June.DECEMBERNATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank became the first UK bank to open its brancheson a Sunday.Twenty three NatWest branches, each offering a full counter service,opened on the two Sundays before Christmas - a move which took thebank's nearest rivals Barclays, Midland and Lloyds by surprise.Though the move was described as "a trial", the Banking, Insurance andFinance Union claimed it was a prelude to seven-day opening throughoutthe year.TRADE UNIONS took one of the world's most profitable banks to courtlast month claiming their new code of conduct infringed civilliberties.Banco Popular Espanol, Spain's biggest bank, was taken to court by theCommissiones Obreras and the Union General de Trabajadores.The code prohibits staff from living outside the town or village wherethey work; no bank employee should act as a guarantor for a loan; andno close family member of an employee should set up a businessenterprise. The code also states that"the bank does not encouragefriendship between managerial staff and the bank's clients or betweenbank staff themselves".DEUTSCHE BANK said it planned to freeze personnel costs in its domesticbanking business in 1995 - but its vice-president and head of personnelChristoph Woehrmann told HRBI that he wondered if the target wasachievable.Woehrmann said the bank planned to shed less-qualified clerks,particularly in payment transactions and branch operations, by usingimproved technology.THE FOURTH-largest bank in the US, Chemical Bank, said it was shedding3,700 employees, or 9 percent of its workforce. The move was aimed atraising its return on equity from 14 percent to 16 percent.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightHUMAN RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995DON'T FIRE ALL YOUR BRANCH STAFF YETConventional wisdom has it that the branch network's days are numbered,that the future lies in ATMs and direct banking. Not so, says DavidRhodes, a believer in reconfiguration, rather than eliminatationREPORTS OF the death of the branch are very much exaggerated. But, likeanything else, bank branches need to be evolved, to be reconfigured andused in an effective way.If you believe some commentators, traditional networks will be sweptaway by the combinations of telecommunications and technology whichwill create the virtual bank. Specialist competitors, such as mutualfund companies, will pick over the bones that are left and customerswill desert those few remaining branches in droves.But let me take you back in time and across Europe to East Germany. TheBerlin Wall has just come down. Imagine a bank in the town of Leipzig -let us call it "Bank A" - with $4 billion of assets, 1,300 employeesand 67 branches. Some 400,000 customers, all in Leipzig, give the banka 67 percent market share.Well, when the wall came down the bank found that life would never bethe same. Big, successful, modern banks such as Deutsche and Dresdnermoved into Leipzig with their bright, more customer-focused branches.So the bank conducted some research among its customers - Chart 1 showsthe results."Bank A" is ahead in only two areas - low fees and convenient branches.So, what do you think happened to this bank? What do you think happenedto market share? What do you think happened to profits? What on earthdo you do to fix all this?Needless to say, one suggestion would be to close branches. AcrossEurope many bankers say branches are becoming obsolete. They arguethere are too many branches and they are being made redundant byautomatic teller machines (ATMs), the telephone, cards and videotechnology.The Big Four in the UK, for example, have closed almost a quarter oftheir branches in the last ten years. Midland, the most aggressive, hascut 30 percent of its network. Midland, incidentally, has statedpublicly that it does not intend to cut any more and here are my viewswhy.Imagine your business as a healthy tree. However healthy it is, itcannot survive continual cutting of its branches. Banks are nodifferent. If you cut branches you lose customers and balances, youlose a critical recruitment tool, you actually only achieve limitedcost savings. You lose cross-selling opportunities and so you losecontribution and suffer reduced profitability. Let us look at why thesestatements are true.Chart 2 shows that more and more customers are shared with competitors.In a world with fewer exclusive customers and more competition, youneed to think very carefully before you take away a criticalrecruitment and service delivery point. In the UK, 75 percent ofcustomers have relationships with more than one institution, and whilea typical bank has 80 percent of the loans held by its customers, itonly achieves 20 percent share of their mortgages and 30 percent shareof their deposits.At the moment, in the UK at least, branches are still heavily visited.Fifty percent of customers visit their branch more than two to threetimes a month. Only 10 percent never visit their branch.But why do customers like to visit their branches? One reason is thatthey are not always as eager to embrace technology as we would likethem to be.Recent UK research found that 40 percent of customers preferred towithdraw cash in person. This is only partly to do with age, anotherreason is mistrust of machines. In Britain, there have been wellpublicised cases of phantom withdrawals. This is a behavioural andattitudinal issue that cuts across all socio-economic and demographicsegments. The mistrust of machines is even higher when it comes todepositing cash and cheques. Finally, over 80 percent of respondentsprefered face to face financial advice, largely because advice is aboutrelationship and trust.The research also showed that some customers prefer remote technologysolutions for some transactions. Any branch banking strategy needs toreflect the fact that large numbers of customers prefer the telephoneor ATMs for some of those transactions. There is also the classicdilemma of people not knowing that they want something until of courseyou give it to them. But I do think that it is important to rememberthat personal contact is central to all banking relationships.There is another reason why branch closures may not be an attractiveoption. Location is the number one reason why people choose a bank. Inthe UK nearly 90 percent of people bank within ten minutes of wherethey live or work.Recruiting customers is of little value unless you sell attractivehigher margin products to them. We talk a lot about databases, customerinformation files, marketing central information files, and so on. Somepeople are enjoying success with these tools but none of them havedispensed with the branch.The most crucial aspect of selling is getting branch staff motivatedand trained. To take the example of one of the best European banks inselling life insurance and pensions, 80 percent of the leads came fromstaff talking to customers, only 20 percent came from targetedmarketing using the databases.If we dissect those leads generated by the branch, 70 percent of thecustomers had originally come into the branch just to conduct atransaction, only 2 percent had come to inquire about life andpensions. One other point, the conversion rate of leads to sales washigher for the warm branch-based leads than the cold database-generatedleads.Let us look at what happens if you do choose to close branches. Firstof all, direct cost. In one large European bank less than 5 percent ofbranches failed to cover their direct costs. The question is: how manydo you need to close before you can make significant reductions incentral or shared costs?But calculating the business impact of closing branches is verydifficult. We found that many customers will not move two kilometres toanother one of their existing bank's branches, if a competitor has acloser branch. We found that within two years of closure a bank isdoing well to have retained two-thirds of the customers from a closedbranch. The only exception, of course, is the merging of two brancheswhich are virtually adjacent.Many customers use branch closure as an excuse to move. It crystallisesdissatisfaction and it seems that many of the most attractive customersdefect. Many customers are very traditional in their bank habits, havelarge numbers of competitive branches nearby, and resent the upheaval.Indeed, our analysis shows that closing 20 percent of branches savesjust 2 percent of network costs (Chart 4). That is not enough to solveanyone's problems.Yet, we need to recognise that changing channel dynamics will leavebehind any under-used network. As volumes switch from the branch itseems probable that branch transaction costs will rise by about 15 to20 percent over the next few years.The development of the debit card, smart cards, new electronic point ofsale technology, increased ATM functionality, will all reduce thevolume of cheque and cash transactions at the counter - but only byaround 25 percent over the next few years. Equally, the telephone andultimately multi-media technology will allow simple sales, inquiriesand transactions such as bill-paying to be removed from the branch.Of course, consumers will accept technology more and more as they getused to things like armchair shopping and the greater convenience andefficiency technology might bring.But, again, this does not suit everybody. Research has shown thatfinancial services came around 50th in a list of uses for theinformation superhighway. This is partly because the superhighwaycannot be used for physical transactions and partly because consumersdo not want their financial records in what they see as the publicdomain.The solution is reconfiguration - reconfiguration to cut cost, to buildsales and relationship management capability.A Consumers Association survey of UK retail banking found a very largegap between customers' expectations of bank staff efficiency andservice and what customers actually get. There is enormous room tobuild better customer satisfaction and I want to emphasise theimportance of the branch in delivering service. If we are to justifykeeping branches then we need to provide the level of service that ourcustomers demand.Quality is best achieved by fixing the processes by which you delivercustomer service. If you cannot do this, your branches will not achievethe cross-selling and recruitment potential that justifies them. Thisrequires setting explicit ambitious customer service targets andkeeping to them.One bank conducted customer research and concluded, for example, thatcounter wait times should be restricted to less than two minutes in thebranch. When they achieved this the staff saw a man looking lost in thebank lobby. "What's the matter?" they asked. "I'm worried," he said."Is this bank in trouble? There always used to be long lines of peopleand now there are none. What's happened to all your customers?"Another one of the bank's standards was based on new accounts. Accountopening was to take place at a sales desk, not at a teller's counter.An ATM card and cheque book were to be offered immediately, specificadditional personal information was to be obtained and the customer wasto be given an introduction to some of the bank's other services. Thebank then measured its performance in achieving these things.This very simple example illustrates a number of things: servicecriteria were set in relation to customer needs; the account openingprocess was designed to provide a relationship framework, collectinformation for future marketing purposes, and to lay the seeds in thecustomer's mind of what the bank could offer; and to do this throughpersonal, rather than through written communication. That is an exampleof a bank trying to maximise the benefit of a face-to-face branchinteraction.The next step in boosting service in an existing branch network is acomplete rethink of the role of the branch.Someone said to me recently that the relationship between a bank andits customers was built on trust and that selling products woulddestroy that relationship. I have to say that individual must havelittle faith either in the products his bank sells, or the staff whosell them.If, like me, you believe that branches are your sales outlets, you willdefinitely need to recognise the emerging roles of your staff in asales-focused branch. The job today - and in the future - is for branchstaff to identify customer needs, to solve customer problems, to leadthe marketing and sales effort. Rather than being accountable forbalancing the books and making sure the cash transactions are doneefficiently.In the future, branch staff are really going to be accountable forcustomer satisfaction and sales. And that means they will need verydifferent skills from the skills they have today. They will needgreater communication skills dealing with customers -negotiation skillsin a way - and, of course, greater product knowledge. All this impliesthat staff must be better trained.Now, if you achieve this you will be doing a lot better than my nextexample: a sort of lost potential used to justify the closure ofbranches. It is to do with the cross-sale of mutual funds. In thisbank, 1,350 target customers for mutual funds came into a branch in anygiven month. Of those 1,350 customers only 50 were recognised by thebank staff as potential mutual funds investors; only 15 were approachedto see if they were interested, and only three actually made anappointment with a sales person.This was partly because the tellers lacked the confidence and the salesskills to approach people; they were offered a $100 incentive, yet itjust did not work. Essentially, 99 percent of the market potential wasmissed by the branch staff. Changing that would have changed thebranch's economics.Another role that the tellers can play in reducing branch costs is byhelping customers to use ATMs. If a customer tries to cash a chequeover the counter, it can be turned into a relationship opportunitybecause the teller takes the customer to the ATM and shows them how itworks ie the customer feels that the teller is delivering valuableassistance. If the teller has the right information in front of them,they could use the opportunity to look at the customer's accounthistory and maybe spot an opportunity to suggest certain credit orinvestment products. If tellers do not talk to customers, they cannotcreate this sort of opportunity. And the opportunity certainly cannotbe created, if the tellers have no branch to work in.So, what will the branch of the future look like? Well, much of theback office will have been stripped out of the branch along with thestaff who felt happier doing the administration. Re-engineering willhave streamlined the customer processes at the front end andcentralised the factory processes at the other end into lower cost,high scale, highly automated and highly efficient processes.One day, the only processing a branch will do is a little point of saleinputting before sending all the paperwork to a regional or a nationalprocessing centre. The counter staff will move from an administrativerole to a relationship management and sales role. This will allowbranches to employ fewer, but more flexible staff. This also means thatin future branches will be smaller.On the left of chart 5 is a picture of the standard format of a UKbank. In the past, most of the branch space was given over toadministrative activities behind the glass screen. Customers werecrammed into the small area at the front.On the right of the chart, we see the small branch of the future with amuch more open customer and merchandising area. The administrativearea, once nearly half the branch, is less than a quarter. There ismore automation for the customer, and for the staff, whose paperwork isnearly eliminated. There is much less space so the branch's runningcosts are much lower. This means a bank's physical presence on the highstreet can be maintained while cutting costs. With less space needed,the bank can afford better locations. Supporting these branches will bea number of remote branded ATMs.Is fixing the branch network really worthwhile? Well, you may havewondered what happened to our bank in Leipzig. I am pleased to say thatit still exists. It re-engineered its branch processes and redesignedits branches. It introduced a relationship and sales culture. It addedATMs and it introduced a telephone banking service for existingcustomers which, incidentally, won a pan-Germany marketing prize. Itkept almost all of its branches.Two years later the customer survey was repeated and, as chart 6shows,"Bank A" is now doing better than its competitors in many areas.David Rhodes is a consultant with the Boston Consulting Group.

AND SEVENTH AVENUE in New York andyou're at the doorstep of the Michelangelo.  No hawking awnings herald itspresence, only two discreet brass plaques:  one, with its name, the other,identifying it as a Summit International hotel.Down the avenue at 48th St., an antique clock atop Victorian letteringintroduces the Renaissance amid a visual onslaught of the Times Squareneighborhood neon.  Like the Michelangelo, its entrance is conspicuouslysimple.Welcome to "hospitality heaven," anchored at 45th and Broadway to the south bythe Marriott Marquis in the heart of the theater district, and to the north bythe New York Hilton at 53rd St.  and the Avenue of the Americas, extendingeast and west for another half-dozen blocks.  This stretch of rooms with andwithout views runs the gamut from glitzy to sedate, with clientele fromtourist to first class.  The names on the marquees are familiar:  Holiday Inn,Sheraton, DoubleTree, Embassy Suites.Beyond the guest room doors, the bars and restaurants and shops, however, ahighly competitive business battle is being waged to win the hearts and mindsof upscale business and leisure travelers.  It involves a savvy blend ofmarketing and financial strategies that boil down to a common denominator:service.But service comes in many forms.  Both Renaissance Hotels International andUtell International are service and management companies.  Neither owns thehotels that are their clients.  For the Renaissance group, equity stakes insome of these clients will broaden the income base.  Utell's client base hasgrown from the vast network of travel and reservation agents and Utell memberhotels around the globe that use its reservations and booking systems, tohotels that carry the Summit International brand, like the Michelangelo, andare part of Utell's sales and marketing network.  Whether it's reservations orfinancial services for travel agents, state-of-the-art technology is the gluethat holds it all together.Each company has set out to create a niche in a highly competitive environmentthat is rebounding from the rampant hotel expansion in the last decade thatsapped profitability.  Now, with an improving global economic climate, aresumption of leisure travel, and an explosion of business travel, thesecompetitors are charting strategic courses to guide their businesses into thenext century.  And the name of the game is branding.When Renaissance Hotel Group N.V.  launched an initial public offering inSeptember on the New York Stock Exchange at $17 per share, branding was a keyfactor.  The IPO is aimed at reaping a return on the investment of its parent,New World Development Co.  Ltd., a publicly traded Hong Kong company, whileconcentrating on what Renaissance does best:  hotel management.  Renaissancecalls itself the only "pure" hotel brand management company in the field:  nocontracting services for laundry and restaurants, no casinos, noentertainment.  The restructuring brings together its three internationalbrands-Renaissance, New World, and Ramada-and converts the 28 Stouffer hotels,acquired in 1993, to the Renaissance brand.Utell, whose hotel reservations system is considered by travel industryprofessionals as the industry standard, has evolved into an integrated salesand marketing business in the past 25 years.  In 1991, Utell created SummitInternational, while it continues to serve travel agents and hotel ownersaround the world.  Since its founding in 1930 by travel writer Henry Utell,the company has passed through three owners and now is part of Reed Elsevier,the Anglo-Dutch travel and publishing giant.While their approaches differ, both companies have some common strategies.They rely on regional management and organization, with local management fromthe operating country.  Service is the driver, and enhancements are aimed atthe business traveler and conference organizer seeking first-classaccommodations.Renaissance has 109 hotels under management around the world, as well asRamada Inns in the U.S.  under a master franchise agreement.  The company hasequity stakes in some of the properties under management.  It operates anintegrated reservations system, and is one of five hotel companiesparticipating in American Express' Membership Miles program.  Renaissance hasits own incentive services, too.  Club Express is a frequent stay guestprogram with an email address, Meeting Express is aimed at conferencecoordinators, and the RSVP Club rewards people who book guest rooms for otherindividuals.  Reaching out to the business traveler, the Stouffer RenaissanceChicago Hotel a year ago was the first U.S.  hotel to offer a 24-hour retailKinko's on-site business center.Utell represents 6,500 hotels in 164 countries, with 44 sales and reservationsoffices.  It is connected to the Global Distribution System (GDS) through450,000 airline reservation systems terminals worldwide.  Through centraloffices in Omaha, Neb., London, and Singapore, it runs a sales and telephonereservation network that circles the globe.  Among the cornucopia oftechnological services afforded to reservation and travel agents isUtellVision, which offers guided tours via computer terminal ofUtell-represented hotels.  Utell's global reservation service, and sales andmarketing activities, are available to its Summit International hotel members."This business is all about sales, marketing, and image," Michael Ball says ofUtell's focus, and its strategy of launching the five-star SummitInternational brand.  "Hotel owners still want to build up their hotels.  Theydon't want to give up their identity and exclusivity."Ball wears many hats.  At Utell, he is the worldwide sales and marketingdirector, with executive responsibility for the development and implementationof strategy.  At Summit International, he is the managing director, where hiswatch also includes Insignia Resorts.  And in several months, he will addanother topper when the company launches a third brand.One would not be off course to include the Utell "brand" with those of thecompany's branded hotels when the talk turns to strategy.  Utell does not ownhotels.  Indeed, the Michelangelo's owner is Star Hotel Group, an Italianchain that was seeking a different feel and look for its New York property.Enter Utell, which handles the chain's reservations system; now, throughSummit International, it provides the marketing savvy.  Sitting in the lobbylounge of the Michelangelo, Ball points to the hotel's midtown Manhattan"neighbors" as an example of Utell's role in the business.  "Owners arecompeting with all these other brand names within a 10-square block.  They'resaying, 'We need marketing to compete.' Branding in America is everything;it's not as strong in Europe."For Renaissance, which posted first-quarter fiscal 1996 net income of $7.8million on revenues of $29.1 million, building the brand meant consolidatingbusinesses that joined the New World Development family through a series ofacquisitions:  Ramada, Stouffers, Penta, New World Hotels International.  Bybringing the United States based business under one name, Renaissance aims tobring added value to the parent and pull in its own return on investment.Today, Renaissance manages 53 hotels in the Americas, 49 in Europe, and 35 inthe Asia/Pacific region; 94 management contracts have remaining terms of morethan 5 years.  Licensing the Ramada name in the U.S.  contributes close to $20million per year in cash flow.  The company has 27 new hotels underconstruction or development worldwide.Robert Olesen, chief financial officer and the strategist behind the IPO,notes that the Renaissance hotels represent $30 million of balance-sheetequity and $500 million in market equity that were buried in the parentcorporation.  Now New World Development owns 55% of Renaissance, 34% ispublicly traded, and the balance is held by private investors who had owned50% of New World Hotels International, the Asia/Pacific-based brand that ispart of the revamped company.Public Access"For us to sit on their books as a $30 million asset, it's very difficult forthe shareholders of that company to see the value of what's buried in thatvery large conglomerate," he says.  New World Development has extensive realestate interests in Hong Kong and China, and is the largest foreign holder ofland use rights in China.  New World Infrastructure, another unit that wentpublic at the same time Renaissance was listed, is a partner in developing atoll road in south China, and is participating in construction of a powerplant."Shareholders can't value conglomerates," Olesen observes, citing thedifficulty of assessing values to assets that have different growth prospects,different patterns for business.  "Now it's easier for the investor to giveproper value to it."  The IPO is a value enhancement for the company.  "Whenword got out in Hong Kong, it got attention.  The value of New WorldDevelopment stock went up and continued to rise despite the Hang Seng Indexgoing down.  I think the shareholders in Hong Kong appreciate the values beingrecognized."To maximize value, Olesen adopted a two-step plan:  a tax strategy and abranding strategy.  The tax strategy involved restructuring the assetsgeographically.  "We made a fundamental change in the way we do business," heexplains, "restructuring what was a U.S.  company to where we took the assetsoutside the U.S.-the real estate, and management/franchise agreements-andbroke them out from under the U.S.  umbrella.  They're free from U.S.taxation and are taxed locally.  Then we created a Netherlands company to bethe umbrella.  All our U.S.  assets are in a series of U.S.  companies."From a management standpoint, this reorganization shook up priorities.  Now,the first is as hotel managers, and second as managers of real estate.  "Ittakes some getting used to.  As a manager, is my goal revenues orprofitability?  And how do I serve the hotel owner?  We view the cash wegenerate in a totally different manner than we did four months ago.  We don'tlook at that cash as available to invest into new beds, new wallpaper.  It isto be invested into new hotel projects.  Now we look at hotels, after payingexpenses and fees, as what is the cash flow needed to improve an operation."New World Development, the Renaissance group's owner, now has hotel capitalexpenditures on its balance sheet.  Most of the hotels under Renaissancemanagement are owned by New World.  Olesen's oversight extends to both thehotel company and the real estate company.  But Renaissance Hotels is not inthe real estate business, he states.  It is not an owner, but a managementprovider.  "Hotel ownership has different investment objectives, lower currentearnings requirements because of the perception of long-term value," he says."Management is a fee-based, current earnings business.  It'sprofitability-oriented.  In most instances, management agreements give apercentage share.  Long term, the real estate company is very limited in whatit can do.  Local financing drives the business.  With the management company,there's not as great a need to go international."To meet earnings objectives, Olesen is targeting 10% per year growth in thenumber of hotels under management.  In the next five years, that translates to175 hotels.  He expects franchises will hold steady near the current level of30.  "More would require the acquisition or takeover of another hotelmanagement company, some outfit with 20 under management," he says.By focusing on management, Renaissance produces "free cash" that can becommitted to new projects.  "We can buy into equity ownership of the hotel;that sets us apart from the competition," he says.  A net holding of slightlyless than 20% can be accounted as an investment on the books.  A 20% stake isworth $5 million.  Currently, five projects are open and operating; five areunder construction.  Olesen would like to add 5 or 10 projects per year withequity ownership.Diversification is not part of the plan.  "I'm a strong proponent of focusedbusiness, focused management," Olesen says.  "There are opportunities enoughin the hotel management business that we don't need to get into ancillarybusinesses."  He cites consolidation of the hotel industry, and theconsolidation of brands.  "We don't have to focus entirely on internal growth.There are rebranding opportunities out there all the time."No ReservationsAt Utell, diversification of services is its stock in trade.  Fifteen yearsago, Utell shook up the reservations industry when it broke with tradition ontwo fronts.  "Until then, the norm was to represent a few hotels in onemarket," Michael Ball recalls.  "To break this approach, we opened officesworldwide, about one a month until we got to 44.  Also by tradition, hotelmarketing companies don't work with competing products.  We said, 'No.' And wewent from 600 hotels to 6,000.  Most people said it can't work:  'Join Utell,you join a supermarket.' Those two strategic thrusts kept us busy until the'80s."The strategies worked because Utell incorporated a third element:  technology.In the '80s, PanAm developed Panamac, a joint reservation system for airlinesand hotels.  "We were the first company to recognize the effect technologywould have," he says of Utell's participation in Panamac.  Today, Utell'sreservation system, called UNISON, connects to all of the major GDSs."I remember sitting in a room talking about this.  Our view was the businesswas going to go to a variable cost business from a fixed cost business," Ballsays.  "Utell became the leading technology agency.  Ask the man in thestreet, he doesn't know who Utell is.  Ask a travel agent, he'll say the bestin technology."Utell's three customers are the hotel, the travel agent, and the traveler.Half of its marketing is directed at hotels, the other half, at travel agents."We're a reservation service.  The market decides where the guest stays.  Ourjob is matching expectations."Expectations within the Utell organization regarding its next strategic movewere another matter.  The 1990s brought a "What's next?"  from management."We were faced with the problem of having a successful company that we wantedto grow by 20% to 25% per annum," Ball says.  "There was the danger of doingalchemy in reverse:  taking 6,500 hotels and 44 offices and converting that toa small, traditional reservations company."Just as dramatically as Utell's numbers had zoomed, growth was capped.  "Wesaw the need to build loyalty with existing partners.  So we stopped signingup hotels and focused on restructuring to build loyalty."  Regionalizationreplaced the British-oriented company based in London.  The three head officeswere established, and corporate staff was slashed to a half-dozen from severalhundred.  In addition to London, Omaha, and Singapore, a Mexico office looksafter Latin America, and sales and marketing are based in Secaucus, N.J."Thinking global, acting local" became a mantra.  In Europe, Utell has apolicy that all employees must speak three or four languages.  And employeesregularly are transferred to different countries.To make a success out of its new game plan, Utell capitalized on a companystaple:  cutting-edge technology.  Ball credits this commitment, and thecreation of the Summit International brand, as pivotal in Utell's strategicsuccess.  As a service provider, technology is becoming Utell's mostmarketable product.  Ball draws fine distinctions when describing the roles ofUtell and Summit International in the lodging industry universe, butultimately there is a synergistic interplay.  The Summit client, by hisdescription, does not need the management and finance support, or the neonsign.  It needs technology."Our hotels are concentrating on managing rooms.  We're spending $22 millionin 1995 and 1996 with IBM, and we're halfway through and on track and onbudget," Ball says.  The new system is a response to the enormous changes inreservation lead times, which have shrunk from 21 days to 6, and the enormousmatrix of rates and terms.  "The new system allows access to the Internet.We're building a home page for Utell.  And Summit is going live on the TravelWeb in January," he says.  These services will benefit the traditional Utellclient and the independent Summit hotel.Summit International's 71 hotels include 25 added in 1995.  Ball expects a 20%increase in 1996.  The corporate target is 250 properties in 80 cities.  "Thebiggest challenge to our business is to introduce the segmentation," Ballsays, citing the distinction between the Summit brand and the 45 luxuryresorts that bear the Insignia name.  "We'll double the size of the companyevery four years.  We've done it the last 10 years."Utell's challenge is making its name a household word to the traveler in theway it is to the travel agent.  The Summit International brand, created toappeal to independent hotels, is the key, Ball says.  And he believes theevolution of the lodging business after overextension and retrenchment in thepast decade has created a market for the independent."For many years, a lot of 'reluctant owners'-the banks-were making decisionsabout hotels.  We saw an enormous growth of branded hotels as a result.  Thenthe banks began to realize there were alternatives to the brands.  Technologyis allowing greater competition-you've got 23,000 hotels in SABRE-and some ofthe more ambitious finance houses are seeing the benefits of going theindependent route."The influence that comes with name recognition, he believes, can betransferred to the independent hotels without compromising their independence.And Summit International is poised to benefit.  "I'd be horrified in a fewyears time if travel agents didn't know the Utell name, and I'd be horrifiedin a few years if the traveler didn't know the Summit name," Ball says.  "Thestrategy is to play at two different levels.  Our growth?  We attribute it todaring to be different.  We've taken the threat out of technology."Back to Headline List CopyrightJOURNAL OF BUSINESS STRATEGY via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Stack AttackWhy authors think that just because they have a new angle onstrategy-psychological, self help, or sporty-that the new approach makes theinformation fresh, is outta my dysfunctional ballpark.

These are questions likely tobe circulating more frequently in executive suites as corporate leaders takeanother look at their workforces through a new lens.The knowledge under discussion is not about work rules and labor/managementrelations, benefits, and overtime pay.  This is about the bottom line-stockperformance, quarterly reports, strategic decisions, capital investment andexpenditures, the costs of doing business-and sharing.  According to a studyreleased last month by Ernst & Young LLP, U.S.  workers who are treated asbusiness "partners" are most likely to be more productive and more motivatedto contribute to their company's profitability.Innovation, according to Timothy Ridge, national director of human resourceconsulting at Ernst & Young, is at the heart of the matter.  The initiativesneeded to educate, motivate, and reward employees apply to private and publiccompanies, union and non-union shops, and will bridge the gap between theboard room and the shop floor, he contends.This view has been captured by John Case, author of Open-Book Management:  TheComing Business Revolution (Harper Business, 1995), who says that by learninghow the business they work for works, employees gain a new appreciation forthe company, feel a more direct stake in its success, and, therefore, workharder to assure themselves the job security they desire.  With a moreknowledgeable workforce, and one that has a stake in the company through stockoptions, employee ownership, profit sharing, and bonus plans, the company is,indeed, a well-oiled machine where all are working for the common good and"us" and "them" are relegated to the scrap heap.It's an ambitious effort, and one that has a track record.  Magma Copper Co.broke the mold in 1991 when it negotiated a 15-year labor agreement with itsunions that built upon the team concept of labor/management relations.  Costreductions have enabled Magma to modernize, launch a major U.S.  explorationeffort, and attract the Wall Street capital to invest in Latin America.  Thestrategy paid off:  In mid-December, Australia's BHP made a $2.4 billion offerfor the company.More recently, Southwest Airlines negotiated a 10-year pact with its pilots'union that incorporates stock options in lieu of salary increases.U.S.  Labor Secretary Robert Reich points to Xerox and Ford as twocorporations where economic literacy of the workforce has been fostered by theestablishment of labor/management partnerships.  "It's an extraordinaryrevolution of the ranks of organized labor to give up work rules for this kindof empowerment," he says."Employees who really understand where they fit in the company strategygenerate real value," Reich notes.  "Employees are assets to be developed,they're not costs to be cut."  He points to the dual forces of competitivenessand competing strategies.  "Getting costs under control is the view of many:cut payrolls, outsource here and abroad.  But there's no sustainablecompetitive advantage.  It only comes from what you do uniquely.  Competitivestrength is a product of teamwork.  There's no way we can sustain recovery andthe economy if workers don't have enough pay in their pockets, if their heartsand minds aren't engaged."Knowledge Is PowerThe Ernst & Young study, conducted December 4-8, was designed to see if a gulfexists between employees and management.  The results offer an eccentric mixof responses to 15 key areas.  Ernst & Young interviewed 146 executives (CEOs,CFOs, senior vice presidents, vice presidents, directors of human resources)and 251 "rank and file employees" (including managers, customer servicerepresentatives, administrative assistants) at Fortune 1000 companies.Employees proved to be very well informed on financial issues concerning theircompanies, but surprisingly ill informed about the operations side.Management turned out to be well plugged into the workforce.  Especiallytelling was the one question that did not involve communication, but an issuethat cuts close to the bone:  job security.  Only 35% of the employees areconfident management will make sure they keep their jobs.  When the questionwas put to senior management, only 26% believed strongly that employees areconfident in them on this issue.  Both groups expect layoffs in the next 12months:  27% of management, 28% of workers.But this study was about information issues, and the responses show someinteresting workplace trends.  Both groups think the company keeps employeeswell informed about finances and business performance (senior management, 51%,workers, 53%).  A whopping 70% of the rank and file know stock price trends inthe past quarter, and both groups believe this knowledge is broad based (63%,54%, respectively).But only 15% of workers know the cost to manufacture one of its company'sproducts or the cost of its services.  Most employees (43%) do not think theirco-workers know these costs, while even fewer executives (39%) think workersare informed.Workers indicated a need for specific information that relates to their jobs.Company communications methods, however, are geared to a broader, generalaudience:  Newsletters (91%, 84%) and meetings (82%, 73%) command the lion'sshare.  Videotapes (43%, 40%) and video conferencing (25%, 28%), both wellsuited to a large audience and easy to customize to meet specific needs, wereat the bottom of the list.Both groups believe employees would be more motivated if they knew how theirwork contributed to company profits (77%, 59%).  And most executives (54%) andworkers (53%) think the company helps employees develop new skills to boostjob performance.Less confidence was expressed by workers asked if management helps themdevelop new skills to earn promotions:  44% agree strongly, 8% disagreestrongly.  Contrast this with 42% of management in the affirmative and 1% indisagreement.Ernst & Young found the relationship between performance and contribution toprofitability illustrates a desire by workers to change their roles and assumemore decision-making responsibility to benefit the corporate balance sheet.Management's response was more optimistic (77%) than workers' (59%), however,when asked if employees will be more motivated if they know how the work theydo helps the company make money.  The second largest worker response group27%, agreed somewhat to the notion.Teams represent the dominant culture (80% for both groups), and both agreeteams make their company more competitive (83%, 78%).  Technology improvementsare credited with enabling employees to increase productivity (63%, 60%).Battling Economic IlliteracyOpen-book management, and the partnering approach, mean management gives up toget.  John P.  Stack, president and chief executive officer of SpringfieldRemanufacturing Corp.  (SRC) in Springfield, Mo., agrees.  Stack says the keyto the strategy in his company was to create a paradigm:  Wipe out theeconomic illiteracy problem among employees.  "It was a way to raise capitaland create jobs," he recalls.  "We had to tell them the success of the companyis derived by the success of the balance sheet."SRC remanufactures engines and engine components; originally, it was theremanufacturing plant of International Harvester.  Stack was the plant managerin 1983 when IH, trying to stave off bankruptcy, was selling off assets.  Heand 12 other managers and supervisors bought the debt-burdened plant andcreated SRC as an ESOP.  Hourly workers hold 34% of the stock.Despite the debt, Stack was able to increase the workforce five-fold, liftproductivity and, with it, the stock price.  Annual sales last year areestimated at $103 million versus $16 million in 1983.  Growth has been at arate of 12% to 15% per year, and debt to sales has shrunk dramatically.  "Ifyou put $100 in the company in 1983, it's worth $2,700 today," Stack says ofthe employee-owners' investment.At AES Corp., the Arlington, Va.-based global electric power company with $2billion in assets and revenues exceeding $5 billion, Dennis Bakke's view ofcorporate culture takes a page from New Age thinking.  "We need to make theworkplace an efficient place without squelching workforce creativity as theIndustrial Revolution did," AES' co-founder, president, and chief executiveofficer, maintains.  "We need a paradigm shift.  We need to eliminatemanagement, the people who train, strategize, make decisions, the things Ilearned at Harvard Business School.  Then we also have to eliminate labor,people who want to be taken care of."Radical?  Maybe.  But it works for him.  Bakke's view is guided by a culturethat sees business as more than a money-making venture.  He cites a quartet of"shared" values:  to act with integrity, to be fair, to have fun, and to besocially responsible.  Bakke argues that 99% of businesses across the board"still operate on the assumption we're all interchangeable parts."  To counterthis, create a fun workplace, where using one's skills builds loyalty anddedication and workers enjoy themselves in the process, he urges."It starts with radical power sharing, really giving up power," he says,explaining the unstructured style at AES.  "We don't have any setauthorization limits, no central budgeting.  We don't send information topeople, we try to generate it.  Information sharing is not sending peopleinformation.  There's no central staff operations, except for accounting.  Andif I could decentralize accounting, and I think I have the software to do it,I will."Information is free and flowing.  AES employees don't have to wait forquarterly earnings reports.  Monthly financials are published in the corporatenewsletter, making all employees "insiders."PartneringAt the end of the day, opening the information loop stands as the criticalelement, and workers as business partners the device to redesign the culture."Partners get real information, not what management decides they need toknow," Case maintains.  "In business, real information lies in financials, thebalance sheet, sales reports, what's needed to make decisions.  Partners takeresponsibility for the business, the exact opposite of the 'hired hand'mentality.  When you're a partner, making money is everybody's job."Jim McCann, president and chief executive officer of 1-800-FLOWERS, cites the"15 minutes of fame" his company has been able to stretch in the past twoyears when it's been "white hot," and the challenge of sustaining current highgrowth levels for another three years.  "To make that happen, I have to builda winning culture," he says.  "My real job is to be a cultural engineer."A former social worker, McCann built his $250 million company in 10 years.Today, it is the world's largest florist:  2,000 shops, 150 of them companyowned.  Customer service is at the heart of his business, and he uses it as atool to empower his workforce-a function of the cultural engineer.  Creatingan upbeat work environment, giving recognition to a people-oriented workforce,these are fundamental to his strategy.  Customer service, in effect, becomesan information channel.His management style incorporates a kind of retro, back-to-basics approach."I was the product of the post-war period.  If you were a shopkeeper doingreally well, you couldn't show it.  You had to be discreet.  That's changeddramatically in 20 years' time," McCann observes.In the business marketplace, people want to go to work and work hard, and havean environment that is compelling.  Creating that environment is McCann's job.Innovation is the key.  He points to Ben & Jerry's for ice cream, Swatch forwatches, WalMart for retail as shining examples of this approach.  The culturefactor opens a window on why businesses struggle, he adds, pointing to Kmart'sfinancial woes:  "The difference with Kmart and WalMart, I think, is that Samcrafted a culture."  That culture carries an openness unheard of in highlycompetitive fields like retailing, a strategy McCann emulates."You must teach what ownership is all about," Stack says.  "The objective isto match people with opportunities.  Something magic happens when people beginto understand (how business works)."  SRC's employee-owners, with theirinitial $100 investments 12 years ago, are a perfect case in point.  "Thepeople who started with our company have $60,000-in Springfield, Mo., that's ahouse.  The trouble is, now they want a boat, and all the other things.  Butchange shows they can get it."Going Global:  Exploring The "Intranet"Networks command a lot of IT management's time, in part because of theirstrategic importance and in part because they are complicated and built onfast-changing technologies.  But there are emerging alternatives todo-it-yourself networking, starting with the Internet.  About two-thirds ofthe companies in a recent Dataquest survey say the Internet is a key part oftheir IT strategy.  Of particular interest is the "Intranet"-the corporate useof the Internet for email and collaborative, groupware-like applications."Some companies are relying very heavily on the Internet for internalcommunications and abandoning their own efforts to create parallel networks,"Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management, observes.In the area of more robust, international networks, some vendors are startingto offer global telecommunications services.  Their target customers:multinationals that traditionally purchased network services on acountry-by-country basis from various local carriers, usually state-owned PTTmonopolies.  The new breed of global service provider intends to do away withthat hassle by offering "one-stop shopping," allowing multinationals to get awide range of voice and data network services in all the countries where theyhave a presence from a single source.The advent of global service is the result of political and financial efforts,rather than technological breakthroughs.  More and more countries have beenderegulating their telecommunications markets, making it possible for a vendorto offer cross-border, end-to-end service.  But creating a global capabilitytakes a tremendous amount of capital and technical expertise, a burden that noprovider wants to shoulder alone.  As a result, vendors have been aggressivelyforming partnerships, joint ventures, and alliances."Each of the major country PTTs and telecom companies are linking up madly ina series of marriages to be able to provide a global infrastructure," JohnScholes, president of Regent Associates International, in East Hartland,Conn., says.  These ventures include World Partners, a product of AT&T,Singapore Telekom, and several other PTTs; Concert, formed by British Telecom,and MCI; and Phoenix, formed by Sprint, France Telecom, and Deutsche Telekom.The opportunity for these companies is clear.  For example, after just a yearand a half in the market, Concert offers services across dozens of countriesand has signed up more than $700 million worth of customers.Despite such rapid advances, true one-stop shopping for global telcom servicesis not quite here yet, observers say.  "Pieces of it are in place," Scholessays.  The remaining portions should come together quickly as deregulationcomes to more markets-including most of Europe's, which are scheduled to beopen in 1998.  As regulatory barriers fall, prices will come down and globalreach will increase.  "There will be more choice," Scholes notes.  "Companieswill be able to buy from a number of partnerships, choosing those that canoffer them the most services worldwide."  -P.H.Alcoa Builds A SuperhighwayAt Alcoa, the maxim "Think globally, act locally" is not just a slogan.  It'sa blueprint for the company's organizational structure."We do not have a single business.  We have a whole array of businesses, withvery different customers and very different customer behavior," KeithTurnbull, vice president of strategic analysis/planning and information, says.Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum producer, posted record1995 revenues of $12.5 billion.  The company's businesses are in sectors asdiverse as aerospace, transportation, and construction.  Its 169 operationssites span 26 countries and run the gamut from bauxite mining in Australia tothe manufacture of auto parts in Brazil, building products in Belgium, andbottle caps in Japan.So when Alcoa announced in November a $150 million joint venture withMicrosoft and Hewlett Packard to build its own information superhighway toconnect more than 15,000 computers in the Alcoa system, Wall Street pricked upits ears."Better and faster access to information is the lifeblood of Alcoa's strategyfor maintaining product quality, serving worldwide markets, and buildingpartnerships with our customers," Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, said at thetime.  Alcoa's corporate strategy has kept the company a Wall Street favorite,even in tough economic times.  The joint venture, called the CommonInfrastructure Initiative (CII), gives Alcoa the ability to leveragetechnology as it leverages its industry position in internationalmanufacturing joint ventures.  And it takes Alcoa to the next step in thecorporate evolution begun five years ago.In 1991, to get closer to its broad customer base, Alcoa reorganized acentralized corporate structure into 22 business units, each with the freedomto align its processes and products with its customers.  Among other things,that means those units are free to pick their own information systems.Initially, these systems were effective in supporting local operations, but atthe enterprise level, they had to be strung together so information could bemoved throughout the corporation.  For example, Alcoa found itself with eightdifferent email systems.  "We have to put them together, we interface them andtranslate them," Turnbull explains, all of which impedes information flow andadds to the complexity and cost.Last autumn, Alcoa began rebuilding its systems using the same hardware andoperating system software around the globe.  "The decision was that we wouldcraft a common infrastructure that would cross over all the business units andprovide a capability for the aggressive and convenient sharing ofinformation," Turnbull says.  And CII was born.When completed in mid-1997, CII will deploy 10,000 Microsoft Windows NTworkstations running Microsoft Office and 450 servers running components ofMicrosoft BackOffice.  There will be a single, integrated email system.Hewlett Packard is providing project management through the implementationphase, hardware configuration and delivery, and ongoing support that includesa help desk.  In the first phase, now underway, 250 of the servers will beinstalled, 4,000 desktop computers will be replaced or upgraded, and the helpdesk will be open at some 150 U.S.-based businesses.This uniformity will make it easier to manage the systems centrally anddistribute software upgrades over the network.  At the same time, it willleave Alcoa's business units with the local processing power and flexibilitythey need to work with specific customers in specific markets.  "This is acommon infrastructure that we can play across," Turnbull explains.  "But we donot impose a way to run the business."He likens the CII to building a road.  "The people who design the highwaydon't decide who will use it, or how many trucks there will be on it.  Butthey do decide what the lane width will be, what the curvatures will be, soeach trucker can make independent decisions about how to travel.  It's justcommon enough to make it useful, and just free enough to make itentrepreneurial and adaptive."When the project is complete, employees in one part of the company will sharea wider range of information with employees in virtually every other part,accelerating overall responsiveness and decision making.  "The speed withwhich we can deploy questions, draw back the data, clock the responses, andfeed it back for worldwide interaction-you just can't match it," Turnbullsays.  "With commonalities of technology, your ability to bounce that back andforth is really fast and pretty painless."The simplified sharing of information will make it easier for business unitsto tap into the wealth of knowledge located throughout Alcoa.  While customersvary, production technologies often are similar.  Business units can learn alot from each other by directly sharing breakthroughs and transferring newtechnologies and techniques.  "It's very useful to be able to trade bestpractices from one location to another," Turnbull observes.  "Ideally, thattrading should not have to climb up some hierarchy and come back down again."Finally, a common infrastructure helps management keep its eye on morecompetitive issues.  If one of Alcoa's automotive units is developing a newprocess, "they don't have to decide what kind of desktop hardware or server touse-and those aren't really going to determine whether your business succeedsor fails," Turnbull says.  "The infrastructure decisions are already craftedand deployed, so they get to skip that and concentrate on what it takes tomake a better car.  The efficiencies come from being able to spend more ofyour time dealing with the business issues, and less of your time dealing withinfrastructure issues."  -P.H.Back to Headline List CopyrightJOURNAL OF BUSINESS STRATEGY via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996ClippingsTeambuilding:  Whoa, team!Everybody's cheering on corporate teams, but they're not infallible.  From:TheParadox Principles, by The Price Waterhouse Change Integration Team.Published by Irwin Professional Publishing, Chicago.Teams are pervasive.  According to a recent survey, 68 percent of Fortune1,000 companies were using self-managed work teams in one form or another in1994.  But not everyone sees teams as effective.  Here are some commonproblems:1.  Teams assigned to inappropriate tasks.  The greatest error of all is toform a team as a knee-jerk reaction to a problem that an individual ought totackle.  Teams too often reflect a manager's reluctance to take action or toempower someone to "get it done."  Teams are not appropriate for all tasks.2.  Inadequate commitment to a clear performance objective.  The single mostimportant determinant of team performance is that each member understandclearly the team's performance goal and that each be fully committed andmutually accountable for its achievement.  This is seldom the case.  Manyteams are simply patchworks of people who would like to achieve an objectivebut who have no unifying obsession to get it done.  An important corollaryhere is that team goals should be explicitly connected to significantissues-and this connection must be ratified by senior management.  3.Inadequate (and inappropriate) training.  By and large, team training is amess.  People come into teams with diverse experience, technical abilities,and-most important-social skills.  Seldom is the training crisply focused onwhat this team needs to know.  Training is abundant but often unfocused andunproductive.  When we asked one interviewee what he had learned from a seriesof sessions on self-directed work teams, he responded, "I learned that youneed an agenda for meetings"-and in so many words, he added, "and not muchelse."  4.  Unrealistic management expectations.  When management sees teamsas a way to transform the organization beyond the teams' specific goals, theuse of teams is likely to disappoint.  There is little evidence that teamshave changed whole cultures or radically altered employee attitudes toward theorganization.  Most teams are groups.  We've been working in groups fordecades amidst cultures strong and weak.  5.  Indecisiveness.  Teams arerarely as decisive as the individuals who make up the team.  How can they bewhen they're struggling to gain consensus, make everybody happy, and craft acompromise solution?  Teams should produce better ideas.  But those ideas willbe of little use if they arrive too late.Technology Watch:  Net resultsFrom the keynote address to Comdex/Fall 1995 by Louis V.  Gerstner, Jr.,chairman and chief executive officer of IBM Corp.If you look at microprocessors, memory, software, storage, you'll see that thelaggard of the technology family has been communications technology.  PCs andservers have become enormously powerful, but they communicate through theequivalent of soda straws.  All that is changing.  Very powerful networkingtechnologies-principally ATM-will be the next phase of computing what themicroprocessor was to the current phase.  I think the most profoundimplication of this new technology is that it will change the nature ofcomputing itself.If the communications link between the PC and the network is cheap enough,fast enough, and has virtually unlimited bandwidth, why not migrate a lot ofthe functions that currently reside inside the PC to the network-theapplications, the data, the storage, and even some of the processing?  This isnot a throwback to the mainframe era.  End users will still have theuser-friendly features they value in PCs.  They'll click on applications, andresponse time will be just as good, if not better.  And because we won't haveto stuff this new device with lots of technology, it can be much lessexpensive to purchase, maintain, and upgrade...When will network-centric computing arrive?  Well, it's already arriving-justlook at the Internet, the most powerful and important of all networks.People, organizations, and networks are connecting at a rate no one expected,and that pace will continue, if not accelerate.I think we'll see network transactions-electronic commerce-take hold veryquickly.  The final step-pushing the applications, operating system, storage,and processing up into the network-will take longer.A lot of people are looking for network-centric computing to pay off in theconsumer space first...but we are seeing it take off first in businesses....That's because while I've talked a lot about technology driving us towardnetwork-centric computing, technology is only an enabler of a much morepowerful force:  a whole new way that...companies, have conceptualized theirstrategic priorities.  They've discovered a powerful new form of leverage:the leverage of organizational knowledge as a means to compete moreeffectively and to differentiate themselves in the marketplace...The most important, most valuable, most sought-after content in the worldbelongs to corporations and large institutions.  It's created and collectedevery minute, around the world:  intellectual property, designs, marketintelligence, supply and demand, customer trends.The problem is, this knowledge is spread across incompatible computer systems.It's distributed across PCs in various departments, it's locked up in desksand filing cabinets, and, yes,some of it is locked in the heads of employees.Powerful networks can unlock this knowledge and move it to the people who canuse it effectively.  This drives shorter cycle times and allows teams ofpeople to become more productive and creative.Computer Analysis:  Shrink rapIf you believe your employees or your customers won't respond to "cold,"computerized response systems, you may adjust your thinking after reading thisfrom Reengineering Human Resources, by Lyle M.  Spencer, Jr.  Published byJohn Wiley & Sons, New York.Eliza is a computer program developed by MIT computer science professor JosephWeizenbaum in the 1960s to test artificial intelligence ideas abouthuman-computer interactions.  This program essentially acts as a nondirectiveRogerian psychotherapist.  Rogerian therapists reflect:  they repeat whatevertheir clients say in a caring, questioning "tell me more" tone.When you load Eliza, the screen displays a welcoming message:  "Hi!  I'mpleased you want to talk with me.  What would you like to talk about?"  If youtype "I'm angry at my girlfriend/ boyfriend," the computer, usingpsycholinguistic analysis, identifies the feeling word "angry" and object(boy*/girl*) in your sentence and asks you:  "Why are you angry with him/her?Tell me more."  The program continues a slightly stilted but plausibleconversation, politely prompting you to explore your thoughts and feelings foras long as you want to play with it.To Weizenbaum's astonishment, the finding regarding computer empathy was thatMIT students and other adults who used Eliza actually preferred the computershrink to human psychotherapists.  Clients found the computer more caring,more accurately empathic, and more responsive.  And, of course, Eliza wasalways available, 24 hours a day, with complete privacy, on students' ownterminals, free, or at least immensely cheaper than a $100-an-hour,hard-to-get-an-appointment-with human therapist.Marketing:  Can I see your ID?From Building Strong Brands, by David A Aaker.  Published by The Free Press,New York.In Japan, corporate brand-building efforts often are aimed primarily towardcurrent and prospective employees.  An impact on customers is seen as almost abonus, and certainly not as the only benefit.  Japanese firms consider itvital that employees feel pride in their firm because of its values, purpose,past success, and future goals.  They believe that workers who feel this pridewill then be more effective and motivated and will buy into the groupactivities and culture that are at the heart of the Japanese management style.Corporate advertising in Japan is thus largely justified on the basis of itsinternal impact.  In contrast, employees in the United States and Europe arerarely considered to be an important audience for the corporate advertisingeffort.Stimulating Strategic and Organizational Change In Japan, firms often engagein corporate identity (CI) programs, the goal of which is to obtain consensusamong a broad cross-section of employees as to what the corporate identityshould be.  The process not only results in a corporate identity for whichthere is "buy-in" among employees but it also provides a vehicle to stimulatechange and renewal within the organization.  For example, in 1985 a broad setof groups within Asahi Breweries discussed the identity and vision of thefirm.  The result was a new attitude that made Asahi Dry and other programsfeasible.  One tangible sign of the new Asahi was a decision to change thefirm's rising-sun logo, which was more than a century old.Management:  Language lessonFor managers, powering their own speech patterns may be as important asempowering their staff.

Risk-Transfer, the trademarked financialproduct it developed in partnership with Chubb Insurance as the underwriter,protects the financing of purchase orders for import, export, and domestictrade transactions by covering them with proprietary specification complianceinsurance.This insurance provides the collateral required by lenders, guaranteeing loanswill be repaid either from the transaction proceeds or by the insurance firm.The cost is approximately 2% of the transaction value.  This compares to 3% to4% typically charged by government or other private insurers.  Commercialbanks, no strangers to economic and political risk, normally require customersto post collateral for 100% of the trade finance funds advanced.Boyd, Brown, based in Chicago, is an international trade banking firmspecializing in purchase order financing.  Worth Brown, president andco-founder, says Risk-Transfer was created "to move the financial risk oftrade from the risk-averse lenders to the risk-accepting insurance carriers."Protection is extended to issues of quality and late deliveries by overseasmanufacturers, too.  Shipments are tracked to confirm the transaction has beencompleted.  Worldwide on-site inspections are conducted for specificationcompliance; logistics management services monitor the progress oftransactions.  And, as an extra feature, Risk-Transfer ensures the partiesresponsible for transportation, customs clearance, and delivery "are competentand adequately insured."Boyd, Brown thinks Risk-Transfer can help solve the industry-wide problem of"trade dispute" that arises from quality and finance issues.  These are plainvanilla problems-wrong size, wrong color, who pays?-but can turn a simplebusiness transaction into the deal from hell because conventional creditinsurance or export guarantys usually exclude coverage when "trade disputes"occur."There are heated battles all the time," a Boyd, Brown spokesman says.  "WithRisk-Transfer, there aren't any questions.  The insurance company pays."Start Me UpSo you're thinking of opening a branch office in Chile.

Au contraire.  Andthanks to mergers, acquisitions, buyouts, and creative consultants, the nameyou hear at the other end of the phone line may have nothing to do with theparty you thought you were calling.Last year, 1,154 companies took new names, representing 13.9% of the more than8,300 companies surveyed by Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc., a corporateidentity management consulting firm based in New York, for its 26th annualtally of corporate name changes.  The survey tracks companies listed on theNew York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Stock Market,as well as major private corporations and U.S.  subsidiaries of foreigncompanies.The 1995 results show an increase of 4% from 1,114 changes in 1994.  But thatpace trails the 1,285 changes recorded in 1992, the highest since 1991."Corporate managers are realizing that a name change should reflect the newway the company views itself, or the metamorphosis it has undergone," JimJohnson, president and chief executive officer of Anspach Grossman Portugal,says.  "Like the products a company names or the services it provides, acompany's name and identity have to be sold to the public."So much for "household words."Corporate image, interestingly enough, jumped 16% from 1994's 179 changes.

Whatthey don't know is that your wages and benefits are below those of your newcolleagues in the same office.Terence Boudreaux, senior marketing executive for Cigna International's groupand employee benefits division, doesn't buy it.  In his view, expatriate andthird-country national (TCN) employees should be paid under the same plan."U.S.  expats and TCNs are often paid on different scales-and they know it,because they often work side by side," Boudreaux says.  "If their benefitsalso differ, it can lead to dissatisfaction-usually among TCNs-and,ultimately, the loss of talented people who figure prominently in thecompany's success."Furthermore, this plan should be distinct from the parent company's U.S.plan.  Benefit costs average 10% to 20% higher in the U.S.  than other partsof the world, he notes, making it more cost-effective to the company to coverthese groups under a "carve-out plan" that takes into consideration thespecial needs of foreign-based employees.  And the plan should be portable."The plan you create for these groups should be structured to follow themaround the world," Boudreaux says.  "A new assignment shouldn't mean a loss ofbenefits or require that the employee meet new preexisting conditionlimitations or deductibles."And he urges companies to demand service at least equivalent to U.S.standards, basics like having one contact point from any location, directclaim processing, 24-hour access to claim personnel, and specialized serviceslike language translation and currency conversion."Employees don't want to have to pay a $15 or $30 currency conversion chargewhen they try to deposit a $50 reimbursement at the local bank," he observes.Born to Run?The eternal leadership debate-born or bred-keeps consultants in business andbusiness schools in vogue.

A catalyst maximizes and stimulates the talents andskills of others.  8.  False.  With greater spans of control, leaders simplydon't have time to look over someone's shoulder.  Leaders need to helpemployees develop self-leadership behaviors.

If only it were that easy.  The multitude of options available toinvestment strategists and portfolio managers today, coupled with the myriadof vehicles in which to pursue them, often leaves many perplexed.  Somebusiness people have a clear advantage-they can sense where the market isheaded.  Many cannot-at least not until now.Twenty years ago, researchers identified an investment opportunity during theyear-end holiday season that has since been dubbed the January Effect.  Thename refers to the tendency of small stocks to outperform larger, blue-chipissues at the end of one year and into January of the following year.Since 1975, analysts have spent a great deal of time studying the JanuaryEffect's various degrees of activity.  While market research doesn't suggestthat the financial markets will trend upward each January, it does indicatethat small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks at that time,whether the general market trend is up or down.Although this phenomenon has occurred nine out of every ten years since 1926,it went unnoticed for a long time because it is not apparent from followingthe performance of large stocks, such as those that comprise the S&P 500 andthe Dow Jones Industrial Average.  In fact, if you look at the S&P 500 for theperiod from 1926 through 1985, you'll find no evidence of the January Effect.However, if you compare the performance of the S&P to a broader stock indexthat includes a number of smaller stocks, such as the Value Line ArithmeticIndex, the Effect is clearly evident a majority of the time.The January Effect is not limited to U.S.  stocks.  Numerous countries aroundthe globe have experienced significantly higher stock market returns inJanuary.  In Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy, the average stock marketreturn in January has been greater than the average return for the whole year.In fact, it is the only month of the year with a positive return for everycountry.  In 65% of the countries where stock is traded publicly, Januarycontributes more than 50% of the total return for the year, excludingdividends.Why January?There are investment-driven explanations for the timing of this trend.Investors tend to sell losing stocks in December for tax purposes.  Theselling pressure forces stock prices below their equilibrium value, and whenthe pressure is suddenly released in January, prices spring upward.  Anothertheory holds that secondary stocks come under pressure at the end of the yearfrom window dressing-a tendency by portfolio managers to "clean out" thestocks of smaller, lesser known companies from portfolios for reportingpurposes.  Stocks are then repurchased after the reporting period ends.  Stillothers subscribe to the notion that renewed interest in buying stocks occursafter the holidays, when investors search for stocks they consider to beunderpriced.Whatever the reason, the fact remains that during the January Effect period,small-cap stocks can achieve returns 10 to 12 times higher than those oflarge-cap stocks.  The stocks most likely to achieve these gains are those ofcompanies valued at less than $200 million; issues that underperformed theprevious year; stocks with high betas (the measurement of stock responsivenessto the broad market) considered especially volatile; stocks with lowprice/earnings ratios; and stocks paying no dividends.Certainly, small company stocks tend to outperform other stocks in generalbecause their risk is higher and investors expect to be rewarded for thisincreased risk.  But the reward they receive in January tends to be far higherthan in any other month.  According to finance professors Robert Haugen of theUniversity of California and Dr.  Josef Lakonishok of the University ofIllinois, nearly all the risk premium for investing in small firms is earnedin January.Futures Key to January Effect TradingInvestment strategists, portfolio managers, and others can take advantage ofthe January Effect in a number of ways with varying levels of financialcommitment:  taking positions in individual stocks, trading options onindividual stocks, or trading stock index futures or options on the futures.Of these alternatives, market analysts often suggest stock index futures andoptions on the futures for trading the Effect.  Taking positions in individualstocks, or options on stocks, does not necessarily ensure a broadrepresentation of the stock market.  In addition to being subject to broadermarket phenomena like the January Effect, stock performance is vulnerable to arange of factors from earnings reports to labor/management problems.Stock index futures and options, like many other financial index products,have the benefit of providing the broader market representation whilerequiring only one transaction for investment.  Market analysts oftenrecommend KCBT Value Line futures and options for trading the effect.  TheValue Line Arithmetic Index, on which Value Line futures are based, iscomprised of some 1,650 stocks.  Each stock is equally weighted, so that astock trading at $150 per share has the same weight as one trading at $20.  A3% minimum fluctuation in the price of a stock with 2 million sharesoutstanding has the same weight as a 3% change in a stock with 10,000 sharesoutstanding.  As a result, the Value Line is viewed as a good indicator of thesecondary, or small-cap, market.To capture the January Effect, the Value Line can be spread against stockindex futures representative of blue-chip stocks, such as the ChicagoMercantile Exchange's S&P 500 Index, a capitalization-weighted index thatmeasures the performance of 500 of the largest, mostly blue-chip, companies;the CME's Major Market Index for monitoring a broad section of 20 blue-chip,heavily capitalized stocks; and The New York Futures Exchange's New York StockExchange Composite Index for measuring the performance of the 2,500 stockstraded on the NYSE.Recent studies indicate trading the January Effect is more profitable withsmall-cap value stocks than small-cap growth stocks.  A growth stock would bea stock that has a market value significantly higher than its book value,while a value stock would be a stock that has a market value below its bookvalue.New York Stock Exchange small stocks tend to be primarily value stocks.Nearly 75% of the 1,650 stocks included in the Value Line index are NYSEstocks.  For this reason, the Value Line index is a logical index for one sideof a January Effect spread.  It also is the only index with two futurescontracts:  the Value Line and the Mini Value Line.  The latter is one-fifththe size of the larger contract, allowing for greater flexibility.  Inaddition to being a vehicle for trading the January Effect, the Value Linealso is an excellent tool for portfolio and pension fund managers to hedgetheir stock market risk.Trading the January EffectOne easy way to trade the January Effect is with a futures spread.  Sellingone blue-chip stock index futures contract (taking a short position) andbuying one small-cap stock index futures contract (taking a long position)enables investors to capitalize on the relative performance between thesecondary and blue-chip markets.To initiate a spread, you could buy a Value Line futures contract and sell anS&P 500 or an NYSE Composite Index futures contract to capture the blue-chipsection of the market.  Hypothetical performance results compiled by the MooreResearch Center based in Eugene, Ore., reveal that Value Line/S&P 500 andValue Line/NYSE Composite futures spreads produced positive results every yearthe contract has traded.If both indexes go up, the Value Line leg of the spread would make a profit,while the S&P/NYSE leg would incur a loss.  However, the Value Line profitswould be expected to be larger than the S&P/NYSE losses, making for an overallprofitable trade.Trading the January Effect through futures spreads is more affordable thantaking actual positions in each equity, because spreads tend to be lessvolatile and therefore have more favorable margin treatments.  Transactioncosts could eat away most, if not all, of the potential gains derived fromJanuary Effect trades conducted with the corresponding basket of securities,and the market impact would be far greater.  Stock index futures allowinvestment through one simple transaction for a small percentage of thebrokerage cost of a similar investment in actual stocks.Options strategies also can be incorporated.  For example, if you areconcerned a declining market could erode the performance of the small-companyside of your small-cap/blue-chip spread, you could protect your small-capcomponent by buying Mini Value Line put options.  By buying a deepout-of-the-money put, whose strike price is lower than the current marketvalue, you can lower your option premium and, at the same time, help to insureagainst extreme losses on the small-cap leg of your spread.  Like the MiniValue Line futures contract, Mini options have a value of $100 times eachindex point, compared with a value of $500 times each index point for ValueLine futures.Timing the January EffectAs with any commodities spread, timing is an important aspect of participatingin the January Effect.  Research shows the optimum results occur whenpositions are initiated in December and liquidated in January, although someinvestors may try to put on positions earlier and hold them later.  ProfessorWilliam Ziemba of the University of British Columbia and commodities traderRoss Clark looked at the Value Line/S&P 500 spread from 1976 to 1986.  Theirstudy, which included making actual futures trades between 1983 and 1987,found the best time to initiate the spread-buy one Value Line contract andsell one S&P 500 contract-was on Dec.  15, with a suggested closing out onJan.  15.  The four years of actual futures spreads yielded a mean return of3.47 index points.In another study, Ziemba and Bruno Vander Cruyssen of Bankers TrustInternational Plc, London, updated the futures market performance informationin the earlier study using data from 1983 to 1993.  They found the averagegains in these 10 years of futures spreads was 4.72 points, while the averagegain for cash spreads between 1976 and 1982 (prior to the introduction ofValue Line futures) was 2.23 points.  This second study points out how theEffect seems to defy the standard market theory that when investment trendsbecome more widely known, market efficiency means they will no longer work.Of all the years Ziemba and Vander Cruyssen studied, the 1992-1993 JanuaryEffect was the most pronounced, and the Value Line/S&P spread continued tonarrow through the end of January as small-cap stocks continued theiroutperformance of blue-chips.According to Moore Research, 1994 was another great year for thesmall-cap/large-cap index spread, whether the S&P 500 or the NYSE Compositewas used as a large-cap component.  Interestingly enough, the Value Line/NYSEComposite spread performed substantially better.  For the 12 years studied,the average theoretical profit has been $1,000 more for the Value Line/NYSEComposite trade than for the Value Line/S&P 500 trade.What About November?Another seasonal trend similar to the January Effect occurs earlier in theautumn.  Dubbed by some market watchers as the November Effect, it is lessconsistent, with a narrower window of opportunity.  Academic research isminimal.Moore Research found the optimum time-frame strategy:  initiate a buy ValueLine/sell S&P 500 spread on Nov.  2 and exit the spread about Nov.  11 usingDecember futures contracts.  Another way is to use the NYSE Composite Index asthe blue-chip component of the spread, using December contracts, initiating iton Oct.  27 and exiting Nov.  12.  Moore's hypothetical trading results showedboth spreads were profitable 11 of the past 13 years.  Moore Research foundthat once this limited effect ends, the broad market tends to dip in mid- tolate November.New Year EffectDoes the January Effect have a future?  History suggests it does.  But keep inmind that a number of factors can influence it in any given year.  Take therecent bullish stock market.  Some observers say the type of stocks leadingthe rally can make an impact on the January Effect.  If blue chips are leadingthe rally during the January Effect period, the Effect could be subdued.  Onthe other hand, if a rally in blue-chip stocks slows at the turn of the year,bulls may switch to small-cap stocks, enhancing the Effect.Currency markets may play a role in the January Effect's performance.  Astrong U.S.  dollar tends to enhance the Effect.  A decline in the dollar canlessen it because of the presumed positive foreign exchange impact for some ofthe large, multinational blue-chip companies.Whatever the market situation, it is important to recember that history is noguarantee of future market performance.  And as more people attempt toparticipate in the January Effect, the opportunity for profit could be reducedor eliminated.Mike Braude is president of the Kansas City Board of Trade, which introducedthe first stock index futures contract using the Value Line Arithmetic CashIndex in 1982.Back to Headline List CopyrightJOURNAL OF BUSINESS STRATEGY via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996The 1996 Business Strategist's Software DirectoryTHE STEAMROLLER OF TECHNOLOGY MOVES ON.

We assembled this year's list afterdiscussions with a number of business professionals and analysts working inindustries from software engineering to food service.  We present softwarethat improves management productivity and offers tools for superior decisionmaking-all packages to support strategic analysis with the goal of improvingthe bottom line.While it's no longer news, the 1993 introduction of Intel's Pentium andMotorola's PowerPC chips opened the gate for desktop PCs to tackle problemsthat had been the exclusive domain of pricey UNIX-based workstations.  Thecombination of sheer computer power (Pentium and PowerPC), advanced marketanalysis tools (idea-building tools, statistical and mapping analysissoftware), and global connectivity (through the Internet) are changing therules of international business.  Even small, locally owned companies areexperiencing national and offshore competition.  Profit margins are erodingacross industries and markets.  To meet the challenge, players must employcutting-edge technology to penetrate and succeed in the worldwide arena.To address the internationalization of strategic analysis, in this year'sroundup more emphasis is placed on geographic-analysis products than lastyear.  Why?  Because more and more strategic marketing questions are bestidentified and analyzed on a map rather than in the form of a 40-column by40-row spreadsheet.  Products such as the hot, new (and pricey) ProphetPointfrom Equifax might have produced in years past a 200-page analysis with rowsof numbers and cross-referencing.  Of course, it would have been nearlyimpossible to interpret.  The same data represented geographically is conciseand easy to understand.  While many organizational issues don't lendthemselves to geographic analysis, almost any market, customer, or salesquestion does.In this opening section of the Directory, we've left out the obvious.  Whileall of these tools are testaments to the computer's fast-growing role inbusinesses of all sizes, from Mom and Pop store to the marketing department ofevery Fortune 500 company, there's no write-up on IBM's newly procured Lotus1-2-3, and we didn't include the standards such as the heavy-weight statisticspackage, SPSS.  Since strategists and marketing professionals already use manyof these products, there's no point in going into detail.  However, we havecreated a listing section, which follows this one, that updates BusinessStrategy's 1995 software directory.We recommend that you check into each product's reputation and usefulness toyour problem-solving requirements before signing the purchase order.  Some ofthese products are expensive (although we think worth the money), and they maynot match your organization's requirements.This section focuses on fresh new possibilities that may help you reap abetter bottom line.  It examines 21 tools that can help you identify,quantify, and take advantage of the global market that looms large as we closein on the second millennium.Strategic Planning and Market Analysis ToolsIn software, new authoring environments for the Internet are making waves fornet surfers.  Internet tools are becoming easier to use, offering featuresthat allow users to build Web pages quickly and with little computerprogramming expertise.  In fact, word processors and page layout programs areincluding basic programming for building Web sites.  In terms of analyticalsoftware, the new Atlas Select, from long-time GIS maker Strategic Mapping,opens the door to affordable mapping technology with a focus on strategicmarket analysis.  And Equifax' hot-off-the-press ProphetPoint is a powerhouseanalytical tool that provides, within minutes, existing locations for 10million businesses and the ability to forecast business growth not just fornext year, but for five years in the future.

GIS software has become the weapon of choicefor choosing sites, but most GIS packages require the addition of multiplesets of expensive data, and there's a learning curve associated with each.  Infact, it's entirely possible that an undertrained strategist might make thewrong decision using an out-of-the-box mapping product because of choosing thewrong data or simply inept operation.  Since most GIS packages are "generalpurpose" in nature, users must be very familiar with the dozens of availablefunctions, options, and controls.  And, a poorly constructed market map isjust as convincing as one assembled correctly.  Mapping technology is only asgood as the weakest link.Now there's Location Quest from PHH Fantus Consulting.  It's not a mappingpackage, but a product specifically designed for site location, and it comeswith a robust set of data for just this purpose.  Most important, siteselection can be set up quickly, even given the numerous variables the productexplores.  And, unlike GIS software, Location Quest poses questions that helpusers build the site analysis without first spending hours setting up ageneral-purpose mapping program for a site location session.  The processproduces comparison tables of labor costs, cost per square foot, and more-allof the vital information that makes one site more attractive than another.Once the "Q&A" session is complete, the product provides a snapshot ofpotential locations with an analysis of each.

Yes, Quick Insight is a useful tool for debugging(or debunking) any kind of product-related strategic planning document.  Usingit, the Edsel would have never appeared in automobile showrooms, Sony wouldhave signed onto VHS early, and Newt Gingrich would have announced that hewasn't running for President months before he did.This software is an unusual addition to the strategic planner's weapons chest.Its methodology helps not only experienced planners, but also those new to thegame.  Quick Insight's raison d'etre is to help users determine the strategicjustification for introducing a new product or service.  As everybody knows,these introductions are enormously expensive in terms of both cash andcorporate resources.  A product that bombs in the marketplace not only"outplaces" many of those unfortunate enough to have championed itsintroduction, but leaves companies with egg on their faces as the press howlsabout money wasted and corporate incompetence.Quick Insight depends on the user to feed it information and then returns a"vote" of sorts on the product or service's prospects in the marketplace.Just the process of answering the 60 or so questions the software poses canhelp strategists sold on an idea come to grips with a frank appraisal of theproduct's success or failure potential.  Quick Insight looks at competitiveadvantages, regulatory environment, competition, risks and benefits, the saleschannel, pricing, and promotional strategies before arriving at its "vote."Once the questions are answered, Quick Insight produces a "score" determininga go/no-go/needs work scenario.  According to the company, the process takesabout two hours.  (It took us about 90 minutes to study a fictional outboundtelemarketing pizza business in which the company calls people and asks ifthey would like to purchase a delivered pizza for dinner.  Quick Insightproduced a resounding and completely appropriate NO to the concept!)Completing the process produces a printed evaluation that can be used as theunderpinning of a merits (or lack thereof) of a new concept.It's too bad that Gavilan Computer, the inventor of the first battery-basedportable personal computer, that spent $32 million in venture capital beforegoing bankrupt, didn't have Quick Insight at its disposal.

She's on a mission-and it's notstuffing hot peppers into burritos.  Instead, she pulls out an Apple Newton,her small personal digital assistant computer, and sniffs around thefacilities.  A health inspector, her job is to spot sanitary hazards.  Aha!Wigdor sights a potential problem and enters her observations into thebooksize, wireless Newton unit.  Next, she pulls from her carrying case asmall, compatible printer and, presto!  creates a report for the outletmanager.  While this is taking place, her notes transfer automatically into afile in a centralized system, enabling the company to monitor the situation inreal time.One year ago, Taco Bell integrated personal digital assistant technology intothe food safety audit system in place at its 4,500 U.S.  outlets, says JoaquinPalaez, senior vice president of technology and quality at the Irvine,Calif.-based chain, a unit of PepsiCo.  The inspections are performed by anoutside firm, Audits International of Highland Park, Ill.  Previously, theapproximately 120 inspectors took notes by hand, then recopied them into themain computer system.  Dozens of extra workers were required to transcribe therecords; up to a week passed before report copies reached outlet managers."We needed a system that would let managers make immediate changes," Palaezsays.  "We considered a PC-based system, but thought it would cost too much.So we came up with the less expensive Newtons."Personal digital assistant technology has been on the market just two years.Yet already these portable, battery-powered computers-capable of convertingnotes written by hand on their small screens into lettered text-have helpedspeed up and streamline operations at a number of companies.The technology has undergone several lifetimes of change.  The Apple Newton,the industry leader, will enter its third generation this month when thelatest model, the 2.0, arrives in stores.  The newest Newton is three inchesby six inches, weighs one pound, and costs $699.  Apple executives say itcontains significant technical improvements over earlier versions-which someusers blasted for poor handwriting character recognition capability andconstant battery recharges.  The company says the latest model also boastsstronger links to local and wide area phone networks for faxing and othertypes of data transmission.Next summer, Apple will launch yet another Newton-friendly innovation thatwill unleash even more user functions.  A new variety of Internet Protocolconnective "stack" technology will grant Newton users access to the World WideWeb.  Currently, Internet browsers are bound to their personal computers.  Butonce the new equipment is available, Newton users will be able to enter theWeb from just about anywhere in the world where phone lines exist.During the whirlwind development period of the last 24 months, several Newtoncompetitors have emerged, including the Zaurus from Sharp and Sony's MagicLink.  "The Sharp and Sony products are not wireless, so they are nothigh-powered enough for industrial operations," Robert Maire, a Morgan Stanleytechnology analyst, says.  "But they can be used indoors as personalorganizers.  At this point, only the Newton is strong enough for outdoorwork."A sub-industry of Newton-compatible products also has evolved.  The Marco andthe Envoy, both from Motorola, are hardware add-ons that enable the Newton totake advantage of radio wave technology for wireless transmissions of data.And new applications, designed expressly for the Newton, expand itsfunctionality.  Magic Cap software by General Magic in Sunnyvale, Calif., wasdesigned to help executives organize themselves.  AllPen Software in LosGatos, Calif., has written custom programs for more than 60 field users.After a number of false starts, Apple finally seems to have positioned theNewton shrewdly in the market.  At its 1994 debut, the diminutive computer waspitched chiefly as a high-tech personal organizer-suitable for storingRolodex, scheduling, and memo information-for use by executives andsalespeople in their offices and on the road.  While the device has found someacceptance among executives-including Walt Disney Co.  CEO Michael Eisner-manypotential users did not want to put up with the early models' poor characterrecognition capability.In fact, the early Newton's handwriting conversion problems became a runningjoke on the Saturday Night Live comedy show and in the Doonesbury comic strip.At the same time, the computer press took frequent pot shots at the memoryleaks, brief battery life, and poor desktop links that plagued the firstversions.Gene Talsky, a technology consultant in Bedford, N.H., says the mini-computerprobably never was suited to the daily needs of most executives.  "I'm notsure how well the product works out for a lot of the initial target audience,"Talsky says.  "Many executives already carry a laptop when they travel andalso have a PC on their desk at work.  They don't need a personal digitalassistant, too."After the Newton's positioning as an executive implement got a lukewarmresponse from many quarters, Apple marketers began pitching it as a fieldtool.Talsky says that this set of applications appears promising:  "The deviceshave a lot of interesting operational uses of interest to corporatestrategists."Planting Cyber-SeedsA Newton-based precision farming experiment at Monsanto Corp.  hasfar-reaching possibilities.  The St.  Louis agricultural conglomeratecommissioned special mapping software from AllPen and currently is refiningthe trial program at its U.S.  test farms."The key to precision farming is being able to make site-specificobservations," Marc Vanacht, who heads strategic planning for Monsanto'sInfield Division, explains.  "There was a time when farmers would just doblanket spraying over vast land areas.  But fields are not homogeneous.  Onearea could have a problem with infestation, while another might haveexceptional yields.""Under the new program, we send our scouts into the fields, and they enterobservations about different land conditions into their Newtons.  Then we usethe mapping software, in conjunction with the military's global positioningsatellite program, to figure out exactly where a given area is on the map.This allows us to make site-specific observations about where spraying isneeded."Without the technology, the scouts would have to return from the fields,compile their data, and key them into a computer before the company'sagronomists would be able to make a spraying recommendation.  Using theNewton, the scouts can dispatch the data over phone lines directly to theagricultural decision makers as the data are collected."The new system can produce savings of a half-day or more," Vanacht says."Often that's enough to save a vineyard or cotton field."Monsanto has big plans for its new creation, beyond the agriculturalapplications.  Vanacht says the company will market its hand-held mappingtechnology to transportation logistics, construction, insurance, and lawenforcement organizations.  He thinks it could be sold to just about any othertype of company with a need to pinpoint the locations of delivery stations,building sites, accident areas, and crime scenes.  If the mapping productssell well, Monsanto probably will form a new division to develop and marketthem, he says.Making a Power StatementFor the past year, Janis Wheeler, a substation inspector at Idaho Power andLight Co.  in Boise, Idaho, has experimented with a Newton.  She uses thecomputer to make notes about the condition of the utility's equipment whileshe moves around the 56 substations she oversees within a 100-mile area."After making inspections, I bring my Newton back to the office and hook it upto a Macintosh," she explains.  "My notes are fed into a database and sent toa server in our downtown office.  This allows anyone in the company to viewit.  Then they can make work orders or track the history of a piece ofequipment.  Work orders are generated automatically for pieces of equipmentthat I have noted have problems."Wheeler estimates that the technology enables her to do in three weeks thesame amount of work she used to perform in a month.  Before working with theNewton, she brought her written notes back from the field.  Then, either sheor another worker would enter all her observations manually into the Macintoshsystem.  After the data entry, the information would be analyzed, and,finally, work orders would be issued.  These long waits were dangerous insituations involving equipment on the verge of collapse.Later this year, Idaho Power and Light will give Newtons to six othersubstation inspectors.  The utility's management is pleased that thetechnology reduces its labor requirements.  Wheeler says that since she nolonger needs to perform data-entry functions when she returns to her office,she has been assigned additional duties.  Based on Wheeler's experience thecompany expects to give new responsibilities to the other substationinspectors after they receive their Newtons.I Hear America MonitoringThe U.S.  federally sponsored Voice of America last year began using Newtonsto link its network of more than 150 contract workers in 47 nations whomonitor the sound quality of its educational radio programs about Americanculture.  The freelancers are stationed in such far-flung places as Armenia,Nigeria, and Myanmar.  The agency tracks broadcast caliber because it usesshort-wave radio technology, which has significant tonal variations from dayto day and place to place.Bill Whitaker, director of monitoring resources, says the Voice of America hasdevised a one-to-five scale numerical code, with five representing the highestlevel of sound quality.  The monitors punch the digitized sound rankings intotheir computers.  Then the numerical data is sent by telephone lines intocomputers at the agency's Washington office.  Whitaker says all reports arereceived within five days of broadcast.Before adopting the new system, the Voice of America relied on the diplomaticpouches at local U.S.  embassies-an antiquated and time-consuming method-toconvey handwritten reports back to Washington.  "It could take weeks, or evenmonths, to get all the reports back," Whitaker recalls.  "And then we had toenter them in our system.  Now we have information about all our broadcastsaround the world at the end of each week."Whitaker adds that the new digitized system also allowed the government tofurther its downsizing goals by eliminating three data-entry positions.Newton, the Next GenerationMany telephone companies use surprisingly low-tech methods to give their crewsthe locations of equipment problems, assigning clerical workers to keep logsof work orders.  Workers in repair units are forced to call in each hour or soto receive updated job lists.The Dracon Division of Harris Corp., a technology manufacturer in Melbourne,Fla., is seeking to change all that with a new PDA-type device called theCraft Digital Assistant, which would allow outdoor employees to receiveinformation about jobs from their computers.  These workers also could updateequipment files as they complete each task.  Printer capability would allowthem to create copies of bills and other documents on the spot to give tocustomers.The Dracon unit, based in Camarillo, Calif., received licensing rights fromApple to create the Craft Digital Assistant, which in essence is awater-proof, "ruggedized" version of the Newton.  The device can be dropped 10feet without damage.The technology is in trial stages.  Ken Selig, director of the division, saysDracon is conducting extensive trial tests for Pacific Telephone Co., thelargest telecommunications lines provider in California.  He notes thatvirtually all the other regional Bells, as well as GTE Corp.  of Stamford,Conn., are experimenting with the Craft product.The telephone companies are eager for this technology because it can boostproductivity while reducing labor.  In addition, the device's efficiencieswould allow these companies to reduce cycle times on many repair jobs.In the ChipsOne of the most intriguing things about PDA technology is that its ability togather information in real time allows companies and entrepreneurs to createbusinesses that were not viable when data collection techniques were slower.Last year Vicky Bradum, a Las Vegas entrepreneur, used Motorola's Envoy tobuild a unique service for local hotels called CasinoLine.Bradum dispatched employees to each of the town's largest casinos to keeptrack of the constant changes in jackpot dollar totals.  The changes weretransmitted to Las Vegas' tourist hotels, which posted large signs advisingtourists of the locations of the biggest jackpots.  Although the operation wasdiscontinued this year, it remains a good example of the types of innovativeapplications made possible by these devices.The Future Is WowIt is highly unlikely the PDA will challenge personal computers in thebusiness world.  But the units are carving out a healthy market share, VadimZlotnikov, a technology analyst with Sanford C.  Bernstein & Co., says.  Heestimates approximately 500,000 personal digital assistants were sold in 1995,making for a $300 million-a-year industry.  Of the 500,000 units, some 300,000were earmarked for field operations; the remaining 200,000 were used aspersonal organizers.In Zlotnikov's view, the development of PDAs as a corporate operations tooltakes place in three stages.  The first is exemplified by the field uses beingemployed by Taco Bell and Monsanto."The second stage will be when there is widespread use of cellularcommunications to access the Internet or corporate local networks with Newtonsand similar devices," he says.  "Some of this technology is already in place.But it has not become widely available yet.  I believe it will do so in 1996and 1997.  It's a question of people becoming comfortable with thistechnology.  When they do, we'll see many people use the Internet and companynetworks routinely for their email.  People also will become just ascomfortable viewing the Internet from a PDA as from a personal computer."The third stage will come when the use of high-band radio wave connectivetechnology, like Motorola's Envoy and Marco, becomes common."People know about these devices, but not that many companies have committedto using them," Zlotnikov observes.  "This technology will allow massive datatransfers between PDAs and office computers.  When it becomes widespread, thewalls between being in the office and on the road will really break down.  Itwill no longer matter much where one is located."A few forward-looking companies already are in the second stage he describes.When Apple releases its "stack" connector to the Internet this summer, a wholenew universe of business applications will open.  In creating Web sites, manycompanies will want to appeal to mobile PDA-linked Net browsers-along withusers who log in from offices and homes.With PDA and other small computer users in mind, American Airlines last yearbegan designing a Web site suited to miniature screens.  "You can't use asmuch lettering when you have less display space," Joseph Crawley, Web Masterfor American Airlines, explains.  "The idea is:  'more thought and lesstext.'"Currently, the American Airlines Web site runs 450 pages.  Among otherbenefits, browsers may tap into the airline's massive SABRE computerizedreservation system to purchase tickets and access seating arrangements, orthey may learn if a certain flight is on time or has been delayed.  "This isthe type of up-to-date information that would interest Newton users, who are,say, riding around in a car," Crawley points out.A demonstration of the American Airlines' Web site was performed on a Newtonat the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas last November.  "I don't know if it wasthe advertising of the future," recalls one attendee.  "But, that tiny sitedefinitely was the biggest 'wow' of the show."THE NEWTON 2.0 AT A GLANCEPRICE:  $699WEIGHT:  One poundMEMORY CAPACITY:  2 MBBATTERY LIFE:  20 hours with rechargable batteries; 50 hours with alkalinebatteriesPERSONAL COMPUTER COMPATIBILITY:  Can be integrated into Windows and MACsystemsSOFTWARE:  More than 50 programs available from indepdendent developers,including AllPen, American Airlines, Dayna, Intuit, ON Technology, SocketCommunicationsCONNECTIVITY:  Two-way wireless messaging capability allows users to send andreceive email, transmit graphic images to fax machines, get pages, and accessstock quotes and news.NUMBER OF WORDS IN INTERNAL DICTIONARY:  90,000, up from 10,000Back to Headline List CopyrightJOURNAL OF BUSINESS STRATEGY via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Special Focus:  A Tale Of Three Web SitesExponential figures are touted routinely for the growth in the number ofusers, the number of information providers, the number of Web sites, and theamount of money to be made on the Web.  Some of the numbers are realistic,some are greatly exaggerated; yet, with almost 14 million unique UniversalResource Locators (URLs)-more commonly known as home pages-currentlyavailable, anyone can find virtually any kind of information on the Web, fromthe ridiculous to the sublime.So, is the proliferation of home pages merely a trend signal of slaves tocyber-fashion?  Hardly.  Cottage industries have sprouted from less.  Allsigns show that business is booming on the Web, across traditional andnontraditional sectors.  Measuring success, well, that will vary from aFortune 100 company to an independent marketer of quality cigars.  It allboils down to style and substance.  What is the strategy for designing,developing, building, and operating a Web site?  Before you brush off the Webas an electronic variation of the hula hoop, take a look at what threedifferent organizations-Chevron Corp.; Virtual Vineyards; and AmnestyInternational-have accomplished on the Web, each with its own purpose andindividual strategy for achieving its goal.These three Web sites stand out as examples of what can be doneon-line-marketing and selling a product; creating an image; and generatingawareness-through careful strategic planning and implementation.CHEVRON:  Defining Corporate ImageNot everything about doing business on the Web is linked strategically toproduct, sales, promotion, or marketing.  Sometimes, the information takes abroader, corporate perspective, as Chevron Corp.  has done on its Web site(http://www.chevron.com).  While a lot of companies developed Web sites justfor the sake of doing it, Chevron has adopted an overall corporatecommunications strategy for its site."A lot of it has to do with positioning," Mike Libbey, Chevron's team leaderfor media relations, explains.  By having a Web site, Chevron is positioned asa leading-edge company technologically.  And by doing it well, Chevron ispositioned as a company that knows what it is doing."This image rubs off on people who may want to buy our products," Libbey says."While we're not selling fuel on our Web site, we are positioning ourselves asexperts in the area of fuel, and the Web site itself is positioning Chevron asa company aware of the latest technology.  It provides an image of Chevron inthe minds of people that we think benefits our reputation, and, by extension,our business."Chevron's Web site came into being in November 1994, when Libbey starteddefining content and how to propose the concept to management.  As hisexploration into the World Wide Web began, he discovered his idea was notentirely new at Chevron."What we discovered was that Chevron already had an external Web site set upfor demonstration purposes developed by our information technologysubsidiary," Libbey recalls.  "They had had a conference on the Web and itsuses a few months earlier, and had set up the demonstration site with adifferent URL.  But, nevertheless, it was available externally.  This actuallyturned out to be a big help, since the hardware, software, URL address, andthe networking already were taken care of by our technical people.  All wereally had to do was to work with them to provide the professional content."Libbey's department provides corporate communications services for print,radio, and television journalists, so it was only natural for his departmentalso to provide the Web site content and product development.  Chevron'sinformation technology department provided the hardware, software, andnetworking.Chevron's Web site is developed on a Unix-based, Sun server, using NetscapeCommunications software.Internal and External StrategiesChevron followed both an internal and external strategy in its Web sitedevelopment.  "Our internal strategy was to establish the corporatecommunications department as having the responsibility and oversight for thecontent," Libbey notes.  "In examining other early corporate Web sites, it wasapparent that a particular business unit within a corporation had the firstidea to put up a site, and that site reflected the business unit's viewswithout reflecting the overall corporation's views.  It looked like whomeverhad the idea first established what they thought the site should be."From Libbey's corporate viewpoint, these sites didn't project a wide-rangingand complete corporate image for a broad audience.  "So our internal strategywas from the perspective of getting our corporate flag out there, if you will,because we are corporate professional comunicators, as opposed to marketers orsome other sector of our business."The external strategy, according to Libbey, was to position Chevron in anumber of ways, each represented by one of the four original areas on its Website:  financials, operations, news and views, and what Chevron's Web sitecalls the exploration zone.Chevron's financials "page" provides comprehensive financial information forinvestors, potential investors, analysts, shareholders, and anyone else who isinterested in the company's financial performance.  The operations "page"provides information about Chevron's nearly two dozen operating companies inthe United States and overseas, in every aspect of the petroleum industry.  Italso focuses on the "human equation" behind the statistics, profiling thepeople at Chevron and their work.  The news and views "page" offers currentinformation about Chevron, from press releases to speeches by top executives.Chevron's fourth original "page," the exploration zone, is aimed at the widerange of educational audiences looking for information about business,particularly the oil industry.  The exploration zone contains articles on thehistory of the oil industry, and explains the workings of various sectors ofthe business, including refining and marketing."All of the stories in the exploration zone were already available in printform," Libbey notes.  "We simply took articles, including art work, from ourstockholder magazine which had many interesting articles on the company, andrepackaged it for the Web.  This allows this information to have a much longerlife."Libbey already is looking to future refinements in Chevron's Web site.  "Myregular job is manager of media relations," he notes, "so I want to provide asmuch information as possible for the media.  What I would like to do in thefuture, if I ever get the time, is to enhance our regular press releasematerial, available on PR Newswire, with additional information, such as maps,charts, graphics, and background information that can't be put on the wire.And when multimedia technology becomes more readily available, adding sound oreven video.  In that way, not only could you have a press release where we'requoting our chairman's words, but you could also download the chairman's wordsand watch him speaking them."Chevron's recent addition of a products and services "page"-which providesinformation on Chevron credit cards, its Techron fuel additive, and fuelsmanufactured by Chevron-is another area Libbey targets for expansion."When you look at the credit card area, all they're doing now is explainingthe different types of credit cards Chevron offers and providing an 800 numberfor people to call.  But we're looking ahead at the possibility of on-linetransactions-taking applications on-line, or even billing inquiries on-line.We have something like 8 million Chevron credit card holders, of which 2million to 3 million are active users.  Even a small percentage of thosecoming on-line would represent thousands of people.  It's going to take awhile, but we're definitely looking at it."Going On-Line Or NotChevron appears to have successfully avoided the pitfall of many Websites-sacrificing content for graphics.  "We evaluated several outside Webpage designers, who agreed with us that people don't want to sit there forlong downloads," Libbey recalls.  "We limited our graphics to cut downloadtime, and yet be attractive and informative at the same time, and our Netscapesoftware also provides us with much quicker downloads.  Our outside designeralso has a very good relationship with Netscape, for whom he also does work,which keeps us extremely well informed on the leading-edge technology which weare pursuing for our site."Libbey's enthusiasm for the Web is laced with common-sense advice."If anyone else wants to develop a Web site, I would say, do it, but thinkabout who your audience is, what you want to say to your audience, and whatyou hope to accomplish.  For example, on our products and services 'page,'there are several things about our Techron fuel additive and answers toquestions about octane and reformulated gasoline.  These are very carefullythought-out answers, and I think people who will read them will recognize wehave an expertise in this area, and that our fuel and other products reflectour expertise."VIRTUAL VINEYARDS:  A Megabyte, A Jug of Wine, And ThouOne of the earliest developers and practitioners of interactive marketing is asmall company based in Los Altos, Calif., called Virtual Vineyards(http://www.virtualvin.com).  But don't look for any wine-tasting parties ortours of its rustic wineries.  In fact, the only way to sample its vintages isthrough the World Wide Web."Virtual Vineyards is strictly a Web-based company," Robert Olson, presidentand co-founder, says.  "When we get the odd telephone or fax order, we put itinto the system by having a clerk use a Web browser, exactly as if the userhad put it in himself.  Older businesses translate Web-based orders into theirexisting telephone or paper-based systems; we go the opposite way."The company is an electronic direct marketing channel for more than 50wineries and food producers.  Virtual Vineyards doesn't just create Web pages."We select the foods and wines, stock them in our warehouse, promote theproducts, process orders, and manage fulfillment logistics," Olson explains.Wine On-LineOlson didn't start out in wine making or marketing.  In his case, thetechnical skills came first, the marketing concept second, and the productlast."I got interested in the power of personalized, interactive marketing whileworking on an Interactive Television project," he says.  "In many ways, theInternet is a better vehicle for what we are doing than is Interactive TV,since it is a more open architecture platform.  I decided that the time hadcome for me to do something on my own."In early 1994, Olson started talking to various retailers about investing ininteractive marketing and interactive stores, but he didn't make muchprogress.  "They all just kind of looked at me and said, 'I've got about$5,000 left in my advertising budget, what can you do with that?' and I said'Frankly, not much.'"It was during a conversation with his brother-in-law, Peter Granoff, about thetrials and tribulations of launching a venture that Olson decided he needed tobuild a demonstration store "for people to be able to figure out what I wastalking about.""What I was looking for was something that had three characteristics," herecalls.  "First, it had to be an information-oriented product, somethingwhere information at the point of sale had a major influence in the purchasingdecision.  I included wine in that category, even though at that time I didn'tknow it was wine that would ultimately become our product line.  The secondthing is, it needed to be a product with a distribution problem-a specialtyoriented product as opposed to a commodity-because I didn't particularly wantto be in competition with Safeway, or WalMart, or any other large chain."The third necessity was having a content expert."What I was talking about was in effect a distribution business, which canlive or die based upon both producer and consumer relationships," Olson notes."So I needed someone who understood those relationships, to give us a betterchance.  That pretty much described the wine business, and that's about theway it worked.  Peter was ready for a change, I needed somebody who understoodthe product, wine is certainly something that has a lot of appeal to a lot ofpeople, and thereby hangs the tale."Granoff, a Master Sommelier, certainly had the background to be contentexpert.  Granoff is only the thirteenth American admitted to the British Courtof Master Sommeliers and currently serves as an Examiner and Board ofDirectors member for the Court's American Chapter.  In 1991, he received theJames Beard Foundation Sommelier of the Year Award.  Granoff serves asconsulting sommelier and wine director for San Francisco's Square Onerestaurant and as visiting lecturer for The Sterling Vineyards School ofService and Hospitality.Coming from a computer background at Silicon Graphics, Olson had a pretty goodidea of most of the technical issues involved in setting up a Web site.  "SoPeter knows the products, knows the suppliers, and has a handle on whycustomers buy what they do," Olson says.  "I know the computers and the Net."The initial site was built on an Intel platform manufactured by Micron, usinga Unix operating system.  Virtual Vineyards utilizes the Netsite CommerceServer from Netscape Communications, a Sybase database, and an orderingsoftware package called Open Orders from Custom Software.Marketing The Marketing"When we first started out, it wasn't too difficult to develop an interest inour product," Olson notes.  "People were intrigued with what we were doing."Virtual Vineyards was one of the first Internet-based marketers, andconsequently, the venture received a tremendous amount of publicity asinterest in the Internet and the World Wide Web was growing."We have discovered, in general, press coverage works better thanadvertising," Olson observes.  "I don't know why that it is, but I think itmay be due to the current crop of users on the Internet.  They may, in fact,be less susceptible to advertising than your average human being, but all thatmay change."Has Olson been able to turn the publicity into a successful operation?Virtual Vineyards is privately held-investors include Applied TechnologyPartners, Lexington, Mass.; Alpine Technology Ventures, Cupertino, Calif; andfour private individuals, including Olson-and Olson is reluctant to give outfinancial data.  He says the company "has been meeting the expectations of itsbackers, which is a very important objective."  Published reports have notedthat Virtual Vineyards processes orders for tens of thousands of dollars worthof wine every month on the Web, with expectations for monthly sales to exceed$100,000 for December.It doesn't appear to be too difficult to generate awareness of the Web site.Virtual Vineyards gets its message out through three different avenues.  Thecompany buys ads on other on-line service providers, such as America Onlineand Prodigy, but Olson says this route "is only marginally effective."The second avenue is through the traditional channels of the press and variouson-line conferences.  "We've been interviewed on CNN and National PublicRadio, and have had articles about us in USA Today and the New York Times, forexample.  And every time a story comes out, we see a pretty good hit inon-line traffic, which convinces us it works."The third way is via word-of-mouth.  "We currently are running a discount giftpromotion to stimulate additional holiday sales," Olson notes at the close of1995, "because gifts get two people instead of one."Keeping an Eye on BusinessVirtual Vineyards' parent company, Net Contents, Inc., provides computer andInternet services.  It also consults in the design and implementation ofelectronic stores for other companies, including a number of wineries.  Olsonlikens the process to working with an architect in the design of a newbuilding:  The first questions revolve around priorities."If you measure success in sales through the channel, you make one set ofchoices about content, navigation, maintenance, back office support, and soforth.  If your goal is to get lots of visitors and cultivate a 'cool' companyimage, you make other choices.  Once you know how you are going to measureyour success, it becomes much easier to build a successful site," he observes."We specialize in transaction-oriented sites, building everything arounddelivering products to customers.  'Cool' in our context means customerservice and value added.  I attribute our success to staying focused on thisbusiness objective.  There is nothing wrong with the many other models on theNet.  But success on the Web comes from knowing why you are doing the project,and staying true to your vision."AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL:  Freedom Through InformationIt's often said that one person can't make a difference in this world.  Well,one person can, if that person is hooked into the Internet, and, morespecifically, into Amnesty International's numerous international, national,and local Web sites.  ("Official" Web site:http://www.io.org/amnesty/overview.html; U.S.  sitesinclude:http://www.traveller.com/~hrweb/ai/ai.html andhttp://www.gatech.edu/amnesty/international.html).Amnesty International's mandate-to free all prisoners of conscience detainedfor the nonviolent expression of their beliefs, fair and prompt trials forpolitical prisoners, and an end to torture and executions-is well suited tothe worldwide communications and information gathering and processingcapabilities of the Internet.  Since it first went on-line a little more thana year ago, the World Wide Web has allowed more than 1.1 million AmnestyInternational members, subscribers, and donors in more than 150 countries andterritories, and more than 8,000 Amnesty International volunteer groups inmore than 70 countries, to report on, monitor, and take action against humanrights violations worldwide almost instantaneously."The Internet has enabled us to mobilize our members and others around theworld, " Robin Bernard, director of information technology, says.  "It alsohas allowed us to become aware of potential and actual human rights violationsthat would not have gotten out otherwise, or would have taken a long time toget out."Human Rights AwarenessWhen Amnesty International first started looking at the Web as an informationand communications tool, the group saw a number of reasons.  "First, werealized it would be an invaluable human rights tool, by providing humanrights information and education to a wide audience," Bernard says.  "Wewanted to enable people to get involved in saving lives and preventing humanrights abuses immediately with the click of a button.  It also provides us ameans to communicate and collaborate with our volunteers, staff, and membersacross the Net in a cost-effective and timely manner."Amnesty International also uses the Net to promote membership in theorganization, and distributes its publications through its Web sites, as wellas income-generating merchandise such as tee shirts and calendars.  Generatingincome is an important strategy for Amnesty International."Our system now is set up through volunteers, and various organizations anduniversities have given us computer space and time with which to operate onthe Net," Bernard explains.  "We would like to set up our Web site in-house,to help us be even more effective, if the funding were available."The Internet and the World Wide Web are especially well suited to non-profitorganizations like Amnesty International, given the lack of communicationsnetworks and options, and government control over communications, in many ofthe countries Amnesty International monitors for human rights violations."The Internet is virtually the only way to communicate globally in a number ofcountries," Bernard says.  During the coup against then Pres-ident Gorbachevin Russia, for example, most lines of communications in Russia, particularlyin and around Moscow, were cut off.  Initial reports and early confirmation ofthe attempted coup were first learned worldwide through individuals andorganizations communicating through the Internet, Bernard notes.Amnesty International programs such as the Regional Action Network and theUrgent Action Network are greatly enhanced by use of the Internet.  The 21Regional Action Networks concentrate their activities on any one of fiveregions of the world to assist people subjected to any of the human rightsabuses that Amnesty International opposes in almost all of the world'scountries.Human Rights ActionAmnesty International's Urgent Action Network consists of a streamlinedprocedure for finding and responding to urgent information about threatenedindividuals and quickly getting it to a pool of concerned people who agree tobe "on call" to send immediate letters, faxes, telegrams, and aerograms togovernment authorities regarding torture, capital punishment, ill-treatment,extrajudicial execution, disappearance, untreated health problems, deaththreats, denial of legal counsel, unacknowledged detention, and forcedrepatriation.An Urgent Action includes specific details about the prisoner as well asbackground information regarding relevant patterns of human rights violationsin the country, recommended actions, addresses of responsible governmentalauthorities, and general guidelines to use when composing appeals.  AmnestyInternational issues several Urgent Actions daily and delivers each one to aportion of the Urgent Action Network.Since the largest portion of the Urgent Action Network is made up ofindividual letter-writers, the Web is an efficient, cost-effective way toreach thousands of people simultaneously, Bernard acknowledges.  "The Webgives us the opportunity to let people know what Amnesty International is,what we do, and how to get involved," she says.And like its organizational, educational, and commercial counterparts on theWeb, Amnesty International is carefully watching technological advances andplanning its future Web strategy accordingly.Technology Assists StrategyA longer term strategy can be difficult to pinpoint when dealing with theWorld Wide Web."The way in which the Web is expanding and technology is advancing, we'llprobably be doing things on the Web and using it in ways we can't even imaginetoday," Bernard believes.  Amnesty International already uses photographsextensively on the Web and plans to increase its graphics use.  "It means muchmore, and has a greater impact, if you can show the faces along with thefacts," Bernard says."And as the technology becomes more available, multimedia capabilities,including not only words and pictures, but sound, film, and video, will alsobecome part of our Web strategy," Bernard observes.  "We hope that it willhelp our members and other interested persons by giving them information, andanswers to their questions more quickly, and provide the kinds of services tohelp us achieve our mandate.  In the commercial world, I guess you would callthat customer service.  In our area, I guess it would be service to humanity."Back to Headline List CopyrightJOURNAL OF BUSINESS STRATEGY via NewsNetJANUARY/FEBRUARY, 1996Special Focus:  Cyber-StrategyA FEW MONTHS AGO, ALCOA ANNOUNCED THE LARGEST information technology projectin its history, an overhaul of its basic computer infrastructure.  The $150million effort will span 26 countries and take several years to complete, andis considered so strategic that Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, cites his"personal involvement and commitment to the project."The effort is ambitious and complicated, but the goal is elegantly simple andclear:  Let employees around the globe communicate quickly and easily.  Whenthe new systems are in place, Keith Turnbull, Alcoa's executive vice presidentof strategic analysis/planning and information, says, "The person who has anopportunity and wants to share it can, and the person who has a problem canfind help."Alcoa's initiative reflects a basic fact of life in the use of strategicinformation technology (IT).  Today, IT is focused increasingly on creatingconnections-between employees, across functions, with customers, and betweendata and decision makers.To forge those links, companies have rushed with great fanfare and urgencyinto client-server technologies, global networking projects, and extensivereengineering programs.  Many have succeeded and found competitive advantagein their technology.  But many others haven't.  "When I talk to CEOs andsenior managers, they tell me information technology is much more importanttoday than it used to be," Larry DeJarnett, vice president of A.T.  Kearney inChicago, says.  "But it still takes too long and costs too much, and when it'sdone it too often doesn't deliver what they thought they were going to get."For example, client-server and distributed systems-in which some or all of thecomputing load is moved off the mainframe and onto smaller computers-now arecentral to most IT strategies.  But some 75% of client-server projects fail,according to Cambridge Market Intelligence in England.At times, those failures can reach epic proportions, Bill Carico, president ofthe ACTS consulting firm based in Marble Falls, Texas, says.  He citespublished reports of National Westminster Bank's troubled $300 million branchsystem that will take several years longer than expected to get up to speed; aU.S.  Army National Guard system created for thousands of users that sometimestakes two days to handle an email message; and an extensive EuropCar systemthat turned out to be so complicated it "collapsed under its own weight" onits first day in operation.Faced with such sobering examples, many executives are approaching strategicIT projects with a renewed sense of caution and realism, "moving from wherethe rubber meets the sky to where the rubber meets the road," Carico says.At the heart of this trend is a basic tenet:  The effective, strategic use ofinformation systems relies less on the latest and greatest technology, andmore on how the technology is managed.  And so companies are spending moretime up front, at higher levels in the organization, thinking about howsystems should be evaluated, deployed, maintained, and targeted to specificbusiness opportunities and problems.What Kind of Systems?Increasingly, such thinking revolves around the customer, and progressivecorporate IT departments are investing in technologies that aim to improveproduct quality and variety, hone marketing efforts, and enhance customerservice.These technologies include networks that give frontline employees the productinformation they need to help customers on the spot; point-of-sale systemsthat let retailers gather data on purchasing patterns and shorten checkoutlines; voice systems that let banks offer phone-based services; andsophisticated databases that let companies develop detailed profiles ofcustomers' tastes.In an age where virtually every company touts its love of the customer, thathardly seems like leading-edge thinking.  But in fact, IT traditionally hasfocused on administrative, backroom operations.  DeJarnett says executivesoften are surprised at just how inwardly attuned their systems are.  Forexample, when a Fortune 500 manufacturer he advises recently examined its ITusage, it found only about 30% of its IT resources were oriented towardexternal customers and 70% were focused on internal customers.  "That company,and others I've talked to since, think it's important to shift that balancepretty dramatically," DeJarnett says.When companies do make that shift, they often find that some of the internalsystems they've been operating are unnecessary, according to DeJarnett.  Whenconsidering a new system, he advises:  "Put yourself in the customer's chairand see if you care.  That will tell you a whole lot about many controlsystems and financial systems.  Customers could care less what kind ofinternal exercises you go through.  They just want the product or service ontime at the right price."There seems to be a clear payoff from using IT to reach customers.  ErikBrynjolfsson, associate professor of management at MIT's Sloan School,recently compared the performance of companies with customer-oriented ITstrategies and those that had more traditional cost-reduction strategies.  "Wefound that the customer-oriented ones had substantially higher productivityand profitability," he says.  "The information technology enables them to havea richer level of information flow between the company and the customers, andto give their line employees the information they need to make decisions.  Thecompanies that used the technology in that way showed a benefit beyond justsaving dollars."Taking ControlWhile deploying those frontline systems, companies are developing strategiesto re-establish some degree of central control over them.  As companies movedfrom mainframes to distributed systems, buying power shifted from centralinformation systems (IS) organizations to business units.  According to theGartner Group, Stamford, Conn., consultants, 60% to 70% of IT spending now isdone outside of the IS organization.Too often, Kearney's DeJarnett says, "that creates a version of anarchy, witheverybody doing their own thing."  Departmental systems, bought with nooverall plan in place, often can't work with other departmental systems.What's more, the variety of systems makes it difficult for technical expertsfrom centralized IS departments to provide maintenance and assistance, meaningsuch tasks fall to "underground support" groups, nontechnical employees end upspending a lot of time fixing and fine-tuning their computers, rather thandoing their jobs.Dispersed control over PCs also makes it difficult to target and controlspending at a strategic level.  Gartner Group surveys show that companiestypically spend 5.8% of their total revenues on IT.  Of that, 2% iscentralized IS spending; 2.3% is done by business units, and 1.5% isunaccounted for.  By 1999, companies indicate their IT spending will reach8.9% of revenues; 1.6% will be controlled centrally, 5.6% decentrally, and1.6% will be "lost in the sauce," William Kirwin, a vice president inGartner's management of information technology group, says.Not surprisingly, many executives are rethinking their decentralized buyingstrategies.  But that does not mean turning back the clock to return totalpower to the technicians.  "IS departments are looking for ways to influencepurchases made by the business units," Kirwin says.  "It's not so much aquestion of centralization versus decentralization as it is realizing thatthere is going to be a hybrid split of responsibility."In some companies, that influence is taking the form of standards thatbusiness units must comply with in making purchases.  Typically, the ITdepartment will dictate what sort of underlying technologies to buy, such asoperating systems and network software.  As a result, maintenance is simpler,and systems across the company can work together.  For their part, thebusiness units are then free to use a variety of application software, theprograms they really use to run their business.Such standards provide an effective balance between central control anddecentralized flexibility and save money along the way.  "Companies that havegone through these rigorous standardization programs report that their totalcost of PC ownership has gone down by 20% to 30%, which may translate to acouple of thousand dollars per user per year," Kirwin says.Handing It OffAt some organizations, the debate over who manages what part of the ITfunction is taken to another level."We're seeing an increasing willingness on the part of executives to consideroutsourcing," Allie Young, a senior industry analyst at Dataquest inWestborough, Mass., observes.  Her firm estimates that outsourcing, a $67billion business worldwide in 1994, will grow to $141 billion by 1999, notincluding various types of IT consulting.More important than the dollar amounts, however, is the changing nature ofoutsourcing, she says.  Traditionally, outsourcing has been a cost-cuttingtool; companies would turn their systems over to a vendor so they could getassets off their books and downsize their staffs.  But a growing trend, Youngsays, is to tie outsourcing to larger, longer-term initiatives and to look atvendors as strategic partners.The key:  selective outsourcing.  As its name implies, selective outsourcinglets companies pick and choose what to outsource, rather than just handingover the total management of systems to a vendor.  So a company might elect tobreak off mundane, day-to-day data-center operations to allow its IS staff tofocus on new strategic technologies, and management to focus on corecompetencies.  Or, conversely, it might bring a vendor in to help with aspecific transition to a new technology.  "There's whole host of new options,"Young says.  "It's not a situation where you're in a contract and you're in itfor life.  Vendors are approaching customers with much more of a blank sheetof paper."All this flexibility makes it easier to use outsourcing as a strategic tool.By partnering with a vendor, a firm no longer has to keep pace with rapidlychanging technology on its own-an increasingly difficult task, even for alarge corporation with a bright and able IT staff."Those people just don't have access to the same kinds of resources as does acompany that is 100% focused on information technology," according to TimBourgeois, a research analyst at International Data Corp.  in Framingham,Mass.  "They don't have the research and development, and they don't have theaccess to the emerging tools and products that change every 18 months."Outsourcing can be used to shorten the time to market for a critical newsystem by giving a corporation a quick infusion of expertise.  "A company maybe looking at the strategic advantage they can gain by implementing a globalclient-server customer-service solution, or perhaps a retailer wants to put ina new system that links its retail operations with its distributors," Youngsays of outsourcing.  "It gives you access to experts that have done thisbefore and know how to roll it out."Young points out that several vendors are starting to extend their servicesinto areas beyond the IS department.  "We're seeing an emerging concept calledbusiness process management, which is going to be real important goingforward," Young says.  In this approach, traditional vendors such as AndersenConsulting or EDS take on and re-engineer an entire IT-intensive businessprocess, such as accounting, human resources, or customer service.  "Theseareas are usually not core competencies for a company," she notes.  "But theyare important, and there is value in making sure they don't become stagnant."Measuring UpWithout a doubt, the most fundamental question in strategic IT is whether it'sworth it.  And the evidence suggests that on a macro level, at least, theanswer is yes.  In a recent study, MIT's Brynjolfsson looked at overallproductivity and IT expenditures at several hundred major corporations.  "Wefound that IT investment was very significantly correlated with largeincreases in productivity," he says.  "The estimated return on informationtechnology investments was on the order of 60%, which was a lot higher than areturn on other types of capital investments."But on a more detailed level, executives have been frustrated in attempts tomeasure and justify specific systems.  Many experts believe that traditionalreturn-on-investment financial calculations are too narrow in scope.  "We'reseeing a reaction to the whole early 1990s school of IS strategy, which tendedto focus on very short-term payback projects- which meant in a lot ofcompanies that the basic IT infrastructure has gone to hell in a handbasket,"Brian Jeffrey, managing director of the International Technology Group inMountain View, Calif., says.That short-term view also tends to miss larger trends, Jeffrey notes.  Forexample, in 1994 banks invested heavily in putting PCs into branch offices.But at the same time, emerging alternatives such as phone and on-linebanking-as well as ATMs-were starting to make branches less and less popular."In 1994, there were 54,000 bank branches in the country; by the year 2000there will be less than 20,000," he says.  "So they were focusing on putting aPC on every desk, and rather missed the point that half the desks are going todisappear."The larger problem is that traditional financial methods simply don't measurewhat IT does best-support innovation.  "When IT is used effectively, itdoesn't just do more of the same, it does things like improve product varietyand quality and customer service," Brynjolfsson says.  "These are things thatare not easy to measure."It's clear that research and debate about how to measure IT's value willcontinue for some time.  But overall, experts are moving toward a broader viewof what technology contributes to an organization, taking into account suchthings as how it affects processes and customers.John Scholes, president of Regent Associates International, an East Hartland,Conn., firm that advises companies in the IT industry, believes executivesshould not unravel IT from the rest of their businesses.  "What they ought tobe doing is stepping up a level, and asking, 'How do I best organize mybusiness?' And then ask how IT enables that," he says.Thornton May, vice president of research and education at Cambridge TechnologyPartners in Cambridge, Mass., cites a need for methods that recognize thevalue of organizational knowledge and the ability to collaborate to leveragethat knowledge."What we are finding is progressive organizations are moving from the 'Howmany clerks did I kill today?' view, to more of a bid-and-ask type negotiationsession, where they ask themselves, 'What is this chunk of functionalityworth?'" May says.  "For example, they might ask what it's worth to have emailthat takes you point-to-point around the organization.  Then, they ask howmuch it costs, and then they start negotiating.

At a recent conference ofthe Industrial Relations Research Association, however,soldiers on the front lines got their chance to give theview from the trenches.The occasion was an invitation to IRRA chapters around thecountry to debate issues involving the "high performance"workplace and present their findings to the Commission atIRRA's annual meeting in Boston. While membership variesfrom chapter to chapter, most local groups are roughlysimilar in composition to the Arizona Industrial RelationsAssociation at 40 percent each from management and labor,and 20 percent neutrals. The chapters' heterogenous makeupguaranteed there wouldn't be unanimity on every issue, butmost clearly made earnest efforts to respond to issuesposed as they appeared to them the organizers, contractadministrators, human resources staff, mediators andarbitrators who make the labor relations system work.Labor: "It Is Significant ..."The chapters were asked the by-now standard set ofquestions about whether amendments are necessary tocurrent labor law, especially with respect to employeeparticipation in the workplace. Labor law changes provokedthe sharpest differences between labor and managementrepresentatives, prompting the AFL-CIO's Sheldon Friedmanfrom the Washington chapter to observe, "It is significantthat the NLRA, a law enacted to protect workers' rightsand organize, now has defenders in the managementcommunity and nowhere else."The reason for this, Friedman and other labor delegatesasserted, is that labor is getting killed by the NLRA ascurrently interpreted and enforced. Friedman presented adismal series of research findings showing among otherthings that in the past 20 to 30 years: (1) consentelections (where the employer raises no barrier to a unionrecognition ballot by employees) plummeted from 45% of allelections to nearly zero; (2) reasonably quick (within 2months of filing) union elections were cut almost in half;(3) the percentage of recognition petitions filed andsubsequently withdrawn has jumped by over one-third; and(4) there has been a nearly 60% rise in the number ofunion election victories that don't result in a firstcontract. Other findings by Friedman showed a directcorrelation between delay in holding elections and unionelection losses.Given management's success in utilizing the NLRA toachieve these results, it's hardly surprising that, as thePhiladelphia chapter's report commented, "for themanagement labor lawyers ... there is nothing proposed[for NLRA changes] that would get their participation andin general they are satisfied with the status quo."Still, a number of chapters stressed dissatisfaction withobstructive delays by both labor and management. "Thecurrent system supports the party choosing to delay theprocess, whether for organizing, bargaining, strikes,grievances or arbitration," the Arizona IRRA chapterpointed out. Several suggestions to speed up the processand "make the playing field more level" kept reappearingin a number of chapter reports (although not necessarilyagreed to by every chapter member). Some items on the wishlists were:* Unions should be able to be recognized without anelection based on 51 percent of the unit signing cards.* Require binding arbitration where contract settlementsare not reached within a set period of time after initialcertification of a bargaining unit.* Extend the election bar from one to three years aftercertification.* Expand the definition of "employee" to include suchgroups as independent contractors.* Enact the striker replacement bill.* Union representation would improve if non-dues-payingmembers of the bargaining unit were required to pay somecosts.* Limit appeal rights. NLRB decisions should be self-enforcing.* Labor and management consultants should be held liablealong with their clients for labor law violations.Worker Participation - The Pros PredominateAlthough the Central Florida chapter noted its uniondelegates "believed that workers gained more benefits bybeing adversarial rather than cooperative," a majority ofchapter reports stressed members' "strong support forcooperative relationships" including the sort of worker-management cooperative committees now virtually outlawedby the NLRB in its Electromation line of decisions. Whilesome chapters urged overturning Electromation, others,like the Cincinnati chapter, said no change is necessarysince "in practice, the decision appears to have hadlittle effect on cooperative efforts because companiestend to do whatever is in their best interests regardlessof case law."Chapter reports contained a number of similar suggestionsfor improving the process, many asking for more trainingin problem-solving, communications skills, consensusdecision making (possibly organized through institutes,the FMCS or area labor-management committees), andnetworks of "best-practice" companies that could serve asmodels.Several chapters warned that good faith on both sides isessential. "A project for improved productivity,"commented the Iowa report, "should not mask a managementgoal to ... coincidentally reduce the work force and/orlower wages. This appears to be a major employee/unionconcern." Iowa went on to note that, "Experience indicatesthat success in cooperative efforts is diminished wherethere is a lack of adequate resources, a lack of supportat the top level of management, a lack of initial andcontinued focus on the objects of the cooperative effort,a lack of continued monitoring...and a failure torecognize accomplishments on a team basis."Arizona, in a particularly thoughtful and comprehensivereport, pointed to the success of cooperative efforts atMagma Copper, "which could not have continued operation atits southern Arizona location if not for the contributionsof the union and its membership." Its summary of theproject noted: "...64 work teams were developed;management levels reduced from seven to three. Fifteenyear contract ratified by 60 percent of the membership 9months before expiration. Results: 1992 gainsharing $4,700per employee, production costs decreased 7 percent, 15percent total cost reduction per pound of copper,productivity increased 61 percent over 3 1/2 years."Unclassifiable Chapter Comments*  The Cincinnati chapter suggested that collectivebargaining agents be "required to have sometraining`driver's education'before they are permitted tonegotiate a contract or call a legal strike."*  The Iowa chapter reached for the millennium and urgedthat "the traditional adversarial relationship betweenemployees/unions and employers must be eliminated... Thisobviously will require a significant change in theexisting labor laws [and] regulations."Back to Headline List CopyrightLABOR TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1994REVIVED IDEAS RUMBLE ALONG THE POTOMACThat murmur of shock and dismay you hear comingfrom Washington probably isn't from blue noses protestingthe latest scandal du jour, but from "free rider" federalemployees facing the possibility of having to pay forunion services in units where they have exclusiverepresentation. While this "agency shop" idea itself isn'tnew it represents a dream of federal employee unions goingback to President Kennedy's executive order granting themlimited bargaining rights in the early 1960s up until nowno one ever gave it much of a chance.What has changed things are details of a proposal leakedthis week from a working group of the National PartnershipCouncil, a committee of union representatives andadministration officials set up by President Clinton lastOctober to recommend changes in civil service laws.Addressing dues and fees the working group proposes: "Inany unit in which voluntary membership has reached 60percent, all bargaining unit employees shall elect eitherto (a) join the union; or (b) pay a fair share servicefee...If a bargaining unit employee objects on religiousgrounds to providing financial support to the union, theemployee shall pay an amount equal to a fair share servicefee to a designated charity." In units below 60%membership, the report proposes a "fee for service"arrangement, whereby nonunion employees could pay theunion to perform a specific service, such as filing agrievance.While a hard copy of the leaked proposals remains to beseen, a source from a union with a seat on the Counciltells LT that the details of the agency shop proposal aswe've reported them are essentially correct. Theadministration hopes to send legislation implementing anew federal labor-management framework to Congress thisspring. The NPC report should be released by the end ofthe month, we're told.Latest figures show that about 59 percent of federalworkers some 1.27 million work in units where unions haveexclusive bargaining rights. If all of them are requiredto pay dues, federal employee union coffers not to mentionclout should increase appreciably.Back to Headline List CopyrightLABOR TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1994NLRB CASELAW FORECAST LINING UP THE USUAL SUSPECTSThe bulk of the latest annual report fromthe Labor Board General Counsel shows how the Lechmere andElectromation precedents still bedevil the labor relationsscene. As readers of these pages know, in Lechmere theU.S. Supreme Court gave employers virtually an unqualifiedright to keep union organizers off their property, whilein Electromation the NLRB banned most types of employeeparticipation committees as unlawful employer dominationof a worker group.The NLRB has never liked Lechmere, and in similar casesthat have come up it has found reasons to distinguish thefacts and arrive at a different result (LT 12/4/93). Inits report the GC looks at three cases where unionorganizers were thrown off property by employers anddecides all are different enough from Lechmere to warrantfiling unfair labor practice charges. In one case the GCsays the union had a stronger right of access to theproperty because it had represented the employees untilthe employer withdrew recognition following contractexpiration and impasse. The second situation involved aban on union election activity by off-duty employees innonwork areas. In the third case the GC found thatnonemployee union agents had a right to distributehandbills at the front entrance to a neutral employer'sstore protesting use of a nonunion subcontractor. In itsbrief to the Board the GC argued that "the union hadcarried its `heavy' burden of proof that no otherreasonable means of communicating with the publicexisted."Several Electromation-type cases prompt pages ofdiscussion showing that the General Counsel is inessential agreement with the Board's reservations againstactivities of employee participation groups. In one case,the GC says that while an employer was within its rightsto negotiate with a union over quality circles, itcouldn't bargain the subject to impasse and then implementthe circles unilaterally (in other words, it was apermissive, not mandatory subject of bargaining). Inanother case, the GC argued that a joint safety committeewas unlawful even though it was set up under a state lawrequiring such committees be established. The NLRApreempts state laws that interfere with the collectivebargaining process, the GC notes.What it all means: No matter what the Supreme Court, LaborSecretary Reich and the Dunlop Commission say, the NLRBhas its own ideas on labor policy. Expect more bites outof Lechmere in 1994, and at least until the Commissionproposes and Congress passes explicit waivers under theNLRA continued strong suspicion of any joint employer-employee productivity efforts.Back to Headline List CopyrightLABOR TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1994REPORTS AND STUDIES BENEFIT COSTS VS. SALARY HIKESLast week we reported government figuresshowing how health care costs are eating into the totalbenefits pie. Now the U.S. Chamber of Commerce releasesits latest annual survey that finds the cost of benefitsup 3.8 percent continues to outpace increases in salariesup only 1.4 percent. As if that wasn't bad enough,employees' disposable pay in effect went down. Accordingto CoC, "the average employer's share of medical andmedically related costs per employee remained virtuallyunchanged at 10.3 percent of payroll, while the total costwas up 1 percent....As a result, employees had to pay 9percent more in 1992 for health care coverage, in additionto increased deductibles in many firms." Overall benefitcosts varied widely by industry, the Chamber finds, fromslightly more than 30 percent for retailers, banks andapparel manufacturers, to more than 40 percent for primaryand fabricated metals, machinery, transportation andrubber industries.Back to Headline List CopyrightLABOR TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1994STATISTICS MAVENS TAKE NOTEThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is changing its method ofcalculating unemployment as of this month.

On November 16, six ofC&L's 12 consulting partners, including the division's managing partnerJose Ramon Magarzo, and three senior consultants, announced theirdecision to leave the firm and join Ernst & Young. Since then, afurther 70 consultants have jumped ship, bringing the total number ofdepartures, as MCI went to press, to about 80. In addition, some sevento eight administrative staff have switched firms.The defections, which took C&L completely by surprise, have struck asevere blow to the firm's thriving consulting business which reportedturnover of Pta2.67 billion ($22 million) in 1995 - nearly three timesthat of E&Y. According to C&L's spokesperson, the firm had justreturned to profitability after several difficult years during Spain'srecession.Magarzo has already taken up his new position as managing director ofE&Y Consultores, replacing Michael McKay who becomes associate managingdirector. In all, the first batch of nine people who left C&L have beenmade partners at E&Y."From Ernst & Young's point of view, this was part of a plan we starteda couple of years ago when I came from the US, and that was to increasethe size of E&Y in Spain," McKay said. "It became clear to us that toachieve the growth, we needed to become a competitive force. Wecouldn't do it through internal growth, we needed external resources ata senior level. That included bringing in as managing director aSpaniard who would run the practice."E&Y used an executive search firm to identify potential hires, but didnot specifically target C&L, McKay said. He said the ex- C&L partnerswere attracted to E&Y in part because Ernst & Young Consultores is aseparate firm with its own profit pool.The raid is by no means E&Y's first attempt to build a strongconsulting arm in Spain. Two previous efforts - the creation of aconsulting division when Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young merged in1990 and the 1993 establishment of E&Y Consultores with the financialbacking of E&Y in the US - have not been as successful as the firmwould have liked. In 1995, E&Y had consulting turnover of only Pta895million and is reported to have suffered substantial losses.Although head-hunting operations are not uncommon, the scale of E&Y'sraid is without precedent and has been perceived by C&L as a directattempt to steal a large slice of its business and seriously damage thefirm. C&L accuses E&Y of inducing its former partners to break theirlegal commitments to the firm by offering financial compensation tostaff to leave C&L without giving the legally-required 15 days' notice.This is denied by McKay."We believe we have acted in accordance withthe laws and contractual obligations of all the people. We have nottaken any projects from them, we have not taken any clients from them.The people who have joined us have joined us of their own free will andexercised their professional rights in the marketplace."C&L believes E&Y's action infringes a number of fair trade rulings laiddown by Spain's competition laws and is considering legal actionagainst E&Y as well as individual proceedings against the formerpartners. E&Y denies any attempt to steal C&L's current projects andhas offered to `lend' C&L its former consultants to finish projectsalready in hand, an offer which C&L describes as cynical and not worthyof consideration.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Overall revenues for the firm were $7.5billion, up 13 percent over 1994.The strong growth in consulting and elsewhere comes as KPMG repositionsitself as a professional services advisory firm. However, it should beborne in mind that the figures reflect total billings to clients, notnet fee income as KPMG has reported in the past.In 1994, KPMG reported net fee income of $990 million in consulting and$6.1 billion in firm-wide revenues. Also in 1994, the firm redefinedconsulting services to include compensation and benefits and taxconsulting services. MCI estimated KPMG's 1994 management consultingrevenues at $875 million (MCI 70).In 1995, the US consulting practice performed best, posting growth of37 percent to $830 million (MCI 73). Growth in Europe was"substantially better" after a relatively flat year in 1994 due torestructuring, according to Keith Fuller, international head of theManagement Consulting Services committee.Asia Pacific also performed well although from a relatively small base.Further expansion is planned there. While Fuller would not revealtarget markets, the likely candidates are Japan, Korea, Singapore, HongKong and perhaps Malaysia.As part of its shift to a professional services advisory firm, KPMG nowrefers to consultative rather than consulting services. According toFuller, consultative services fall into five categories: strategy andfinancial management (including value- based management); performanceimprovement; package implementation like SAP; enabling technologiessuch as mobile computing, networks, technology infrastructure andclient/server; and tax consulting services."One of our objectives worldwide is to substantially increase our rateof penetration in our existing client base. We believe that we canprovide a substantial increased volume of service to clients . . . andcan provide better value to them as well."The professional services advisory approach involves both an industryand a specific functional focus. This is very different fromtraditional cross-selling of consulting and audit services, Fullerstressed. "Professional services advisory is where a traditionalservice provider couples a better understanding of the client withmulti-disciplinary support to determine where the client has anopportunity to improve profitability."For example, two tax experts were involved in a recent business processre-engineering and technology assignment for an insurance company andproduced savings for the client which would otherwise have been missed."Historically, I don't know if we would have found that. Or maybe theclient wouldn't have gone forward. But because we can approach this byprofessional service, we can do it at a lower cost and higher value,"Fuller said."We've not done away with functional specialities, we're justapproaching clients and the market differently," he added."I think thisis the model all clients will expect from their professional advisersin future."The multi-disciplinary industry-focused teams which KPMG has introducedin the US and UK will continue to be rolled out around the globe withthe French, Dutch and German practices, among others, already moving inthat direction, he said.KPMG also plans to continue expanding the types of services offered toclients through alliances such as the one in 1995 with a US investmentfirm to which KPMG licensed its name (KPMG BayMark). Other allianceswill be with academics and thought leaders - and in outsourcing, hesaid.In several countries, the firm is exploring outsourcing in the processmanagement area. But, Fuller said, there are no plans to follow EDS orAndersen Consulting into the IT outsourcing arena.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

They involved 26 consultants who were made redundant and 24who were either redeployed in other parts of the firm or foundpositions with clients. Touche now has 542 consultants, a reduction ofnearly 9 percent.Four partners are also leaving the consultancy practice. One is AndrewDavis, head of Touche Ross's IT consulting practice and 1992 presidentof the Management Consultancies Association, who is retiring due to ill-health. Three others will move to other parts of the firm, according toJohn Everett, head of the UK practice.No further cuts are expected, he added.The cuts reflect a market shift away from high-level IT strategy workand towards implementation assignments which require fewer seniors bututilise a larger number of junior staff, Everett said.They follow a major reorganisation within the consulting practiceearlier this year which saw the establishment of dedicated sales andmarketing teams in key industry sectors, and the creation of a separatemanagement advisory service (MAS) unit to provide managementconsulting, tax and accounting advice to small and medium clients. TheMAS unit is now part of the audit side of the firm (MCI 73).The cuts also pave the way for the proposed US-UK-Canada alliance whichwill form the first leg of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International'sproposed global consulting firm (MCI 74). The practices have begunworking together at an operational level, although the legalities willprobably not be completed until June, Everett said.A new management team comprising the heads of the UK, Canada and threeregional US consulting practices is being established to run the mergedoperation, Everett said. Pat Laconto, head of the US consultingpractice, is expected to be the new chief executive.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This nowincludes the managing partners of each of its three business units(consulting, systems integration and outsourcing), a global practicedirector and a vice-president in charge of worldwide marketing.In November, the group announced that it had filled all those postswith the hiring of the following:- Dick Anderson, managing partner for the systems integration practice.Formerly chief technology officer for Kwasha Lipton, a benefitsconsulting firm, and before that a principal at McKinsey.- John Corsiglia, managing partner and global practice director.Formerly president of BDM Technologies, the IT consulting and systemsintegration subsidiary of BDM International, and a partner at McKinsey.- Fred Lawrence, market management vice-president, responsible forgrowth in vertical industry and geographical markets. Formerly aprivate investor and a consulting managing partner with Arthur Andersen& Co.The other managing partners on the team are James Corey who runsconsulting and Rick Roscitt, who is in charge of the outsourcingpractice. They all work out of the group's Washington, DC,headquarters.The team has been charged by Solutions's president and chief executiveVictor Millar with carrying the group's aggressive focus on "electroniccommerce" into the crowded services marketplace and into the group'ssecond year."We think of electronic commerce as not just offering [access to] theInternet, electronic invoices or a page on the World Wide Web, butchanging the rules of competition for our clients," Corey said. "Allindustries will go through major strategic change enabled by electroniccommerce. That's really the scope of our Solutions business. . . Ourdifferentiator is to be bold and innovative in our thinking."The new executives are not the group's only new hires. Despite therecently-announced split of AT&T into three new companies and top-to-bottom lay-offs and buy-outs, AT&T Solutions continues to grow. Aspokesman said the only impact the buy-outs might have on Solutionswould be in outsourcing, the largest practice within Solutions. A smallportion of this practice might be affected, he said.At the end of 1995, AT&T Solutions had about 350 consultants on boardand anticipates hiring another 2,500 in 1996. The "business thinkers"will come from outside the parent company but some of the technologyskills are already available within AT&T, Corey said. "The marketdemand for this type of service is very powerful right now. We areclearly resource-constrained, not demand-constrained," Corey said.It is that combination of AT&T's technological and innovation skillscombined with the consultants' business expertise that will make AT&TSolutions stand out in the market, he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This will offer a single source forcommunications, computing and consulting services. Details are stillbeing worked out, but essentially, EMS will design, operate and managecommunications and computing networks. MCI estimates the US market forsuch services at $40 billion and growing at 20 percent per year."The whole idea is the single source provider for the ongoingmanagement of the computer network," said SHL spokesman Rick Gray.SHL will continue to operate as a stand-alone company with its owncorporate identity within MCI, Gray said. It has 4,500 "consultants"and had about $1 billion in revenue in 1995, Gray said. In addition tojoint offerings with MCI, SHL will continue to develop and manageclient/server solutions for companies moving away from centralisedmainframe systems.SHL saw the deal as a good way to give it the size and scale needed togrow in the IT services market. "It gives us further global reach,because MCI is more expansive on a global basis," Gray said."It also gives us the marketing prowess and power of the MCI company.They are a very savvy marketing company and certainly that will help topush the services into the marketplace. And third, with a much largercompany like MCI, a company that has a lot of money in the bank, youare fortifying your whole financial position. You make yourself a well-heeled competitor with the deep pockets that help in this kind ofbusiness."MCI, one of the world's largest communications companies, reports $13billion in annual revenue and a broad array of services, from longdistance to Internet access to outsourcing. Revenues for itsprofessional services unit were not available."As far as what MCI brings to this partnership, it is our datacapabilities which complement what SHL brings to the partnership interms of computing solutions," said MCI spokesman Jim Monroe.

Hebelieves IBM has the technological and consulting talent needed to helpit regain its stature in a rapidly-changing technological world.IBM Consulting Group has been playing a key role in supporting theexecution of that strategy, said Joseph Movizzo, the group's generalmanager."There were pieces of it that we had started, like business recoveryand the systems management business," he said. "So we had someinitiatives in place that now have to be expanded because they havetaken on a more critical role. The network- centric environment isgoing to have a profound impact on the business. Any consulting firmcould say, `We've been doing some of that.' But now it becomes adifferent way of thinking about [our] business."The consulting group was formed in 1992 when IBM recruited Robert Howefrom Booz-Allen & Hamilton and Stephen Mucchetti from Coopers & Lybrandto develop the new business (MCI 41). But the group has struggled as ittried to find focus and collaborate with a broad spectrum of products-oriented divisions.Since then, it has become more integrated into the IBM framework andnow operates as part of IBM's complex matrix of products and servicesdivisions. In 1994, Mucchetti and Howe were named heads of industrygroups and Movizzo took over as general manager but in a redefined rolewith diminished responsibilities (MCI 66).Shifting these early founders into running businesses was not a matterof sidelining them, but of putting them into "major rolessaid."What people don't realize is what a dramatic change that was in our go-to-market model," Movizzo said. "Part of this is getting people tothink in a non-hierarchical sense. What is a big job today? It isdefined by content and breadth, scope and size, rather than where it isin an organisational chart. You can't see that any more in a matrixednetwork organisation."The consulting group is working closely with Lotus DevelopmentCorporation, the software company that makes Notes and which IBMacquired in July for $3.5 billion. Lotus' consulting capabilitycomplements what the IBM Consulting Group is doing, Movizzo said. "Forus and their people on the consulting side it was a comfortablerelationship to begin with and now we are going to build on that."In addition, some of IBM's consulting practices are deployed in ISSC,an IBM subsidiary that does systems integration and outsourcing. "Weare also tightly linked from a development point of view in that theconsulting group was given responsibilities for developing and rollingout common methodologies and tools across IBM, including ISSC," Movizzosaid.By the end of 1995, the consulting group expected to have 2,800professionals in 33 countries, including new offices in India and SouthAfrica. About 40 percent of the consultants are involved in industrytransformation/general business consulting, 30 percent do IT/networkingsystems and the other 30 percent do object technology and datamodelling, he said.And all three areas are reportedly growing, although IBM will notrelease consulting-specific numbers. In 1993 and 1994, the groupclaimed 35 percent growth, and Movizzo said the group continued to growat 25 percent to 35 percent in 1995. "Of course, the bigger we get, theharder it is to maintain that percentage," he said."But . . . on anongoing basis, I'd like to keep it there.

It became apublicly quoted company in 1986 and was subsequently acquired by alarger public limited company which retained the Doctus name for itsmarketing and business services activities.  When that group collapsedin 1991, Doctus' management consulting operation was bought by CRT, thetraining and recruitment group.In 1993, however, CRT decided to pull out of management consultingafter a substantial decline in the market for Doctus' services, withthe business losing #0.7 million ($1.09 million) in the first half of1993.  Mahoney led a magement buy-out and Doctus Consulting Europe, asit was then known, began scaling back its European activities (MCI 54).Both AA and Doctus declined to discuss details of the acquisition, butAndersen said it involved a small payment for the tangible assets ofthe business, plus partnership for Mahoney.  Nothing was paid forgoodwill."Doctus has an established track record in securing long-term profitperformance improvements with clients throughout the UK utilities,aerospace and airlines industries.  Andersen's extensive worldwidereach will provide Docuts with a vital edge," Mahoney said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Revenue per consultant also decreased althoughthe firms appeared to have hired more consultants.The information is contained in FEACO's annual survey released inDecember 1995. It is based on responses from 17 of the 25 nationalassociations which comprise the federation. The 17 associationsrepresent 1,088 consulting firms employing 31,257 consultants. FEACOmembers have an estimated 34 percent share of the total consultingmarket in Europe.Combined income for these firms was ECU4.55 billion ($5.9 billion) in1994, almost the same as in 1993. Management consulting fees, however,fell to ECU3.89 billion from ECU4.28 billion, the previous year.At the same time, revenues from other sources such as software salesand interim management increased. In some countries, notably theNetherlands, these account for more than half of consulting firms'revenues.The number of consultants employed by the firms grew by 9.4 percent butaverage revenue per consultant fell by 17 percent to ECU124,867,possibly reflecting the departure of senior consultants and theirreplacement by inexperienced graduates.It should be borne in mind, however, that the members of the nationalassociations vary considerably, ranging in size from firms of less thanten consultants to those employing several hundred. Also, manyinternational consultancies do not join national associations and aretherefore not reflected in the figures.Despite widespread discussion of globalisation, it would seem - basedon FEACO's data - that management consulting is becoming anincreasingly national activity. Domestic business accounted for 88.5percent of FEACO members' turnover, a slight increase over the previousyear. But this is a somewhat misleading statistic, reflecting in partwhich office sends out the invoice on a cross-border assignment, notwho is doing the actual work.Countries with the highest share of management consulting relative togross national product are Switzerland (0.35 percent), Germany (0.32percent) and the Netherlands (0.30 percent).Overall, information technology and systems work increased by 51.7percent, finance and administration grew by 15 percent and humanresources jumped by 16 percent. Demand for other types of consultingwork declined.FEACO SURVEY 1995                      Total                      Turnover of  Share of             No. of   Member       the Market  Management             Member   Firms        % (by       Consulting  OtherCountry      Firms    (ECU/m)      turnover)   Fees        RevenuesBelgium            27   200.19     60%           153.00     47.19Denmark            40    62.00     30%            56.75      5.25Finland            26     9.83     30%             8.73      1.10France             53   503.00     50%           503.00      0.00Germany           437   900.00     15%           900.00      0.00Hungary            19    14.25     n/a             6.04      8.21Italy              47   162.10     n/a           151.70     10.40Netherlands        32   560.16     60%           270.64    289.52Poland             39    36.00     30%            21.57     14.43Portugal           16    25.00     n/a            19.85      5.15Russia            173    31.00     60%            25.44      5.56Slovakia           22     8.00     30%             6.86      1.14Slovenia            9    11.30     n/a             7.81      3.49Spain              21   305.00     40%           286.20     18.80Sweden              9    75.37     n/a            45.87     29.50Switzerland        86   200.00     25%           121.72     78.28United Kingdom           32 1,450.00     60%         1,305.30    144.70Total        1,088.00 4,553.20     34.42%      3,890.48    662.72% Change                 -0.41%                   -9.21%   131.27%Source: Feaco [Data was gathered in 1994 but published in 1995]Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The firm is looking at incorporating allof its operations in the Netherlands - consulting, accounting and tax,he added.If the plan goes ahead, C&L would be the second Big Six firm in theNetherlands to become a limited liability company or NV. KPMG Klynveldadopted NV status on January 1 1995, although two of its Dutch memberfirms, actuarial consultancy Brans & Co and tax law firm KPMG Meijburg,opted out of the move (MCI 65). The other Big Six have seemed reluctantto consider incorporation.Turnover in C&L's management consulting operations was relatively flatin 1994, growing by less than 3 percent to DFLl84.3 million ($52.6million). Firm-wide, revenues slipped by 2.1 percent to DFL659 millionalthough C&L recorded a profit of DFL26.9 million, an increase of 18.5percent over 1993.

Worldwide fee income at DTTI rose 14.4percent to $5.95 billion in the year to August 30. The firm did notprovide a fee split but said an expansion into emerging markets and theacquisition of information technology firm ICS were among the factorsbehind a record increase in revenues in fiscal 1995.Ernst & Young reported record worldwide revenues of $6.87 billion forthe fiscal year ended September 30. This was a 14 percent increase overthe prior year and higher than its worldwide growth rate for theprevious four years combined. The firm reported"strong momentum" inmanagement consulting but did not provide worldwide consultingrevenues.In the US, E&Y's revenues were up 16.9 percent to $2.97 billion, morethan double the increase in fiscal 1994.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT CONSULTANT INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BRANDING - THE ULTIMATE GOALFrom the old-fashioned Coca-Cola bottle to American Express' "AcceptedWorldwide" message, every company wants a consistent image that buildsbrand loyalty and consumer confidence. So, too, do consultants, asKarin Ronnow finds outBranding, as it is dubbed by the marketing gurus, has taken onincreasing importance in the hyper-competitive, global consultingmarketplace. Many of the international consulting firms have investedin branding over the years, but those that ignored it are now findingthat it has merit.Branding takes two forms - the "message" about what the firm is, andhow that plays out in a physical "look" and "feel". For consultingfirms, the message has always been the primary emphasis. But, as firmsbecome more global, they are finding that a universal "look" is equallyimportant."Branding is something that creates loyalty, premium pricing potentialand better distribution and market acceptance," said Allan Steinmetz,Arthur D Little's senior vice-president and corporate director ofmarketing."That's why companies invest so much in it. Setting standards withregard to corporate identity, the look and feel, from business cards tobrochures to presentation styles . . . It is a common denominator thatcreates an asset value for a corporation."Bain, for example, is taking a new look at branding. The firm hasrelied heavily on its 23-year history on face-to-face contact tocommunicate its message of "results". Bain doesn't advertise, so clientcontacts are the only opportunity to "describe what we do, how we do itand how it is a different product or process than our majorcompetitors", Bain director David Bechoffer said.But in the past year it has become clear that while Bain is consistentin "cross-office" delivery, the firm has not always looked like itdelivered that consistency, Bechoffer said. "We have grown incrediblyquickly over the past three or four years and we didn't all `look' thesame," Bechoffer said. "So we went through a major exercise to developa standards log and we will now have material that will be top-to-bottom consistent to reinforce the strength of what we say, fromletterhead to business cards. So when we have people from five officesworking on a project, the clients see one firm and not five offices.And that does mean something in the long run."Brand is "a very deep discussion for a firm", said Kathleen Reichert,vice-president of marketing and communication for AT Kearney.The recent acquisition of AT Kearney by Electronic Data Systems - twomarkedly different firms - creates a challenge for Reichert, who mustdefine how the expanded Kearney looks and communicates.In its former incarnation, AT Kearney had a definite, conservativelook, best defined by the "Kearney grey", which permeated the firm,from literature to the walls of its downtown Chicago headquarters. EDShas presented a more outgoing, innovative image."We are still in the process of looking at how we want to brand the newAT Kearney," she said. "At this point, we want to retain the AT Kearneylogo, which we think provides continuity and allows us to draw fromsome of AT Kearney's strengths and traditions."We are reviewing the introduction of colour, the use of visuals thatexpress the excitement, change and some of the important strategicthrusts we hope to be undertaking over the next three- year period."Brand defines the firm to the outside world but also helps build aculture internally. Arthur D Little sees its brand largely as its"personality", which the firm defines as "confident, aggressive, easyto work with, learning with clients side by side, in conjunction withdeep knowledge and experience in three distinct lines of business",ADL's Steinmetz said. Consultants are charged with conveying thatmessage in any client contact.But visually conveying the message is important too, and ADL has athree-ring binder of "Corporate Graphic Standards", which details thesize, shape and look of all corporate brochures, biography sheets, factand office lists, corporate statements, letterhead, business cards andmailing labels. The colour and placement of the ADL logo on a page, thesize of the font, and full-length and abbreviated versions of ADL'sidentity statements are all spelled out to ensure continuity around theworld."We went through an exhaustive brand identity review about eight yearsago and it was designed to give us a global, more contemporary feelabout who we were," Steinmetz said. "We hired an outside identityconsulting firm that specialises in this area and this is what theyrecommended. We conducted client research and this is the one thememost reflective of what we wanted to be known for."A distinct personality has added importance for Andersen Consulting.Along with selling itself, AC must also distinguish its services fromthose of its sister firm, Arthur Andersen, which sells some consultingservices as well as tax and auditing. AC stresses that it offersdifferent services and that its clients are dissimilar."The biggest problem is perception," AC partner Jim Murphy said."Andersen Consulting is only six years old . . . so we continue to workon setting up separate brands. There are parts of it that are the same - integrity, professionalism. But in the audit and tax business, youneed a heavy emphasis on conservative steadiness. In our business, youneed an emphasis on creativity, innovation, sharing risks. It's a wholedifferent personality, a whole different brand."For itself, AC stresses its commitment to being a global firm. And,while it has invested in consistent visual messages, the idea of "themessage" is emphasised to new hires from their first day on the job."Most important is something that we don't own, our clients own, it'sin their head, and that is our promise to them as an organisation,"Murphy said."It comes to life not only in advertising, literature andsignage, but how people act on the job, how we sell, what kind ofclients we have, what we do. All of this has to be part of the built-inculture. It comes out of our training, the acculturation process. Theidea of what Andersen Consulting stands for as a brand is put in frontof all our employees."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT CONSULTANT INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HIGHLIGHTS OF 1995Mergers, acquisitions and lawsuits characterised the consultingindustry in 1995. The year saw the biggest ever acquisition of oneconsulting firm by another, as well as the largest legal action to bemounted against a consultant. William Gleeson looks back at the majornews storiesJANUARYThe year started with the theme "out with the old and in with the new".KPMG Switzerland swept away its old management team, replacing it withnew faces in the boardroom. The changes came after two years of flatgrowth at the firm. Jacob Baer took over as head of a four-personmanagement committee following the departure of Hugh Mathews, who wasformerly joint managing partner with Baer.Ernst & Young found itself on the wrong end of the first writ of theyear over a claim for several million pounds from North West ThamesRegional Health Authority in the UK. The dispute centred on E&Y'salleged failure to meet a deadline for the completion of a consultancyproject to give the authority a new payroll system and financialsystems mainframe.FEBRUARYThe year was punctuated by job loss announcements. One of the earliestwas Ernst & Young's disclosure of changes to its US actuarial andspecial services practices.The actuarial, benefits and compensation unit was renamed "humanresources" and reorganised into 11 locations, down from 20. At the sametime, E&Y's mergers, acquisitions, reorganisations and insolvencypractice was renamed "financial advisory services" and concentrated at19 locations. As a result of the changes, around 100 people left thefirm.CSC continued its expansion in Europe with the acquisition of Germaninformation technology consulting firm, Ploenzke. At the same time, CSCacquired SODI, the small international consulting arm of GroupeOuroumoff in France. This followed the acquisition of OuroumoffConsultants in 1994.George Cox, former chairman of P-E International, became the UK chiefexecutive of Unisys. His hiring was the latest in a line of about 70high flying consultants taken on at the systems firm.MARCHAnother major theme during the year was the shift to "global"consulting practices. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International led thepack with its announced plans for a global practice, but DTTI denied itwould split consulting from audit and tax as Arthur Andersen andAndersen Consulting had done in 1989. (Further details emerged as theyear progressed).The century old names of "Peat" and "Marwick" officially disappearedwhen KPMG Peat Marwick in the UK announced that as part of itsincorporation plans, the firm was renaming itself KPMG. In the US,Deloitte and Touche acquired the Canadian firm, InternationalConsulting Solutions, a SAP software implementation company. The newbusiness was called ICS Deloitte, employing 700 professionals.Victor Millar resigned as head of Unisys Worldwide Information Servicesto run a new consulting unit at AT&T, the US telecommunicationscompany. The move by the communications giant into the crowdedconsulting market created yet another consulting, systems integrationand outsourcing competitor for the big international consulting firms -and pointed up the value of consulting in selling other informationtechnology services.The consultancy profession in the UK voiced its disapproval of agovernment scheme to set up a register of consultants to assistcompanies in choosing suitable advisers. The consultants argued thatthe scheme was too expensive and bureaucratic and would jeopardiseclient confidentiality.APRILErnst & Young and mid-tier US accounting and consulting firm KennethLeventhal, which specialises in real estate work, announced a merger.Leventhal was formerly the US member firm of CKL International, the15th-largest international accounting and consulting network.Rumours emerged that EDS was set to make a bid for AT Kearney but thiswas strongly denied by both firms. "We have no need or desire to sellthe firm," said Kearney's chief executive Fred Steingraber. Meanwhile,it emerged that EDS's fledgling management consulting arm had a $22million loss in 1994 on revenues estimated by MCI at $180 million. Thefirm attributed the losses to start-up costs.Andersen Consulting, on the other hand, reported worldwide revenue up20 percent to $3.45 billion.MAYIn what appeared to be the largest lawsuit to date against a consultingfirm, UOP, an Illinois-based engineering company, filed a $100 millionsuit against Andersen Consulting, alleging fraud, incompetence andnegligence.It was the latest in a string of lawsuits against consultants andunderscored that consultancies are as much at risk from legal actionsfor negligence as the accounting firms. UOP, which licenses petroleumand gas processing technologies, claimed that Andersen bungled thedevelopment of two computer systems intended to streamline thepreparation of engineering specifications and project cost estimates.Ernst & Young's London practice announced plans for a radicalrestructuring of part of its operations along multi-disciplinary lines.Consultants, auditors and tax advisers were grouped together to servespecific market sectors: financial services, media and resources,industrial and consumer services and owner- managed businesses. About90 of the 400 UK consultants were deployed in the new groups.Proudfoot also announced plans to change the way it does things. Thefirm said it would revamp its product, improve its internal operationsand launch its first ever global marketing drive. It also announcedresults showing the severest drop in revenues in its history for itscore productivity services in Europe. Overall, turnover plummeted 24percent to #106 million ($165.6 million). Some 150 jobs had been shedin the year to March, bringing the total workforce to 700.Mercer Management Consulting expanded its presence in Europe byacquiring MID, a mid-sized French strategy firm, and announcing plansto open an office in Madrid. The acquisition boosted the number ofMercer consultants in Europe to 250, up from 70 two years ago.JUNEMore writs, this time in Australia where Price Waterhouse Urwick wassued for the largest claim for damages brought against a firm ofmanagement consultants in that country. The firm was sued for $A13million ($9.8 million) by a failed museum venture and its developer,for engaging in alleged misleading and deceptive conduct and for breachof contract. The claim centred on a report predicting the likely numberof visitors to the museum.The month saw also more bad news for PW, this time in Canada. The firmannounced the closure of its Quebec IT office due to major cutbacks inconsulting work from the Quebec Government.OC&C, the former strategic consulting arm of Coopers & Lybrand, said itplanned to establish a base in North America and Germany within a yearas part of an international growth strategy. The firm, which hasoffices in London, Paris and Rotterdam, left C&L in April.JULYAfter a series of on-again, off-again talks, EDS acquired AT Kearney tocreate a $550 million business with more than 2,300 consultants. It wasthe first significant move by an IT firm into the upper echelon ofconsulting leagues.The deal signalled the growing polarisation between the so-called superproviders of integrated consulting services and the rest of the pack.EDS paid $300 million in cash. Additionally, to retain key staff, some200 Kearney executives received about 7 million shares of class EGeneral Motors stock, vested over ten years. The GME stock tracks EDSbusiness and was valued at $296 million.There was bad news at Gemini Consulting which laid off some 170 staff -8 percent of its worldwide employees (since revised, see page 6). Mostof the lay-offs were in the US. The cuts came amid rumours of seniorlevel disagreements within the firm and the abrupt departure of theformer chairman and chief executive David Teiger.AUGUST/SEPTEMBERAndersen Consulting started litigation proceedings against rivalconsulting firm, American Management Systems, alleging copyrightinfringement, breach of contract and intentional interference withAndersen's business opportunities. Andersen contended that AMS copiedAC's proprietary tax administration system design and demanded $20million in lost profits and damages.Another firm revealed some of its globalisation plans. Ernst & Youngreplaced its European Consulting Group with a new legal entity, GlobalClient Consulting, in a move towards developing a global consultingpractice. The new group will service major clients in large-scale,multi-year contracts.General Motors announced plans to spin off EDS in a move designed toallow EDS to pursue its strategic objectives more effectively. CSCIndex pulled out of Korea just months after closing its Japan operationacknowledging a "substantial" loss on its Asia venture. And Coopers &Lybrand agreed to pay the state of Arizona $750,000 after a long-running investigation into alleged bidding improprieties in the awardof a consulting contract. C&L denied any wrongdoing.Most of KPMG's consultants in Adelaide defected to Coopers & Lybrand.The three partners who defected said KPMG's federated organisationalstructure in Australia - where each state has its own managementstructure and reporting lines - was an obstacle to building a nationalpractice in Australia.OCTOBERAmerican Management Systems struck back in the copyright dispute withAndersen Consulting. AMS filed a counter lawsuit, charging defamationand accusing Andersen of trying to damage AMS's business prospects andreputation. According to AMS, Andersen contacted AMS clients claimingownership of the tax system design which AMS was using. A New Yorkdistrict court denied Andersen's request for an injunction to preventAMS from using the disputed tax system design.NOVEMBERMore job losses. Gemini Consulting laid-off 100 employees in the secondround of redundancies at the firm in the year. The cuts followed monthsof turmoil at the firm, including the sudden departure of new chiefexecutive, Dan Valentino, and a slide in US revenues.Yet another in a long line of reorganisations at Proudfoot, thepublicly-quoted consultancy which has seen its revenues and share pricedwindle in recent years. This time, the company announced plans torevamp its management structure in the US, dramatically scale back itsMexico operations and centralise control over its business developmentand operational activities. Malcolm Hughes, the chief executiveappointed in October 1994, said"this is my one and only restructuring.It is what I was brought in to do. I think it will result in aturnaround fairly quickly."Deloitte and Touche in the US and Touche Ross in the UK said they wereon the brink of forming a transatlantic alliance of their consultingpractices. The move follows the creation of Deloitte & ToucheConsulting Group in the US as a separate division of the US firm.Andersen Consulting announced plans to make a physical break withArthur Andersen by leaving the worldwide headquarters of the firm inChicago. The firms legally split in 1989. Some observers say the movewas inspired by Andersen Consulting's desire to distance itself fromArthur Andersen, the accounting part of the firm, as AA attempts todevelop its own consulting practice.DECEMBERAmdahl came out as victor in the battle for Canadian technologyservices company, DMR, after outbidding its two rivals, IBM Canada andBDM International of the US. The deal created another giant in thegrowing services and solutions marketplace, which is increasinglyposing a threat to the traditional management consultancies.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT CONSULTANT INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996PAST, PRESENT AND FUTUREManaging change may be the core activity of a consultant's work, butobserving change is also part of the job. Ed Hendricks, who retires aspresident of ACME, the US-based association of management consultingfirms, at the end of December, looks back on his years with theassociationIn the nearly 17 years that I have been on the staff of ACME, I havehad the benefit of an unparalleled overview of the worldwide consultingmarketplace. To say that there have been significant changes in theprofession over those years would be a gross understatement. And, anyattempt to capture all of those changes would be futile. However, as Iprepare to leave the association at the end of 1995, I did want toshare some of my observations.The late 1970s and early 1980s were the end of the era of the big nameowner/founder firms. These were the days of the Dick Pagets and CarlSloanes (among others) who, by force of their personalities, maintainedthe image of consulting as a "gentlemen's club".There was a desire among the firms to share information and to helpeach other out. As Carl Sloane put it at an ACME meeting, "You do goodwork we all benefit, you do bad work we all suffer." There was also astrong belief in professionalism, translated into standards ofpractice, which had the effect of limiting competition while fosteringthe development of personal relationships and even friendships amongthe heads of firms.By the 1980s, different types of organisations began to enter theconsulting arena. Driven by the "Big Eight" accounting firms' move intoconsulting in a concerted way, marketing activities were increased, andsome practitioners even began to use the word "sell" in the samesentence as "consulting services", much to the chagrin of the purists.Bigness and one-stop shopping came into vogue and acquisitions andmergers became the norm. Many of the founders/owners took thisopportunity to capitalise on their investments, and their firms wereacquired by larger entities. The resulting mega-firms required adifferent type of management structure, and a"revolving door" in thechief executive's position was not unusual.Relationships became more professional than personal in nature,resulting in some hesitancy in sharing information.A slowdown in overall growth in the early 1990s caused many consultingfirms to increase their marketing efforts and to experiment with theuse of advertising and other ways to differentiate themselves from thecompetition. And, firms began to look for other services to provide, inaddition to consulting advice.Training programmes, software and outsourcing activities became commonancillary services offered by consulting firms. As clients began toincreasingly demand experienced consultants to work on their projects,consulting firms found themselves caught in a price compressionsituation. In many cases, profits suffered and competition increased.Throughout the early and mid-1990s, consulting firms found themselvesunder increasing pressure from a variety of sources. Outplacedexecutives from client companies formed their own consulting firms andcompeted for the work they had previously contracted out. Clients beganto demand that consulting firms share the risk of change with them, andcontingency fees, value added bonus plans, and other billingarrangements based on the successful implementation of the consultant'srecommendations became more common.Technology became an important part of almost every consultingassignment. As a result, consulting firms either began or increasedspending on their own technological infrastructure. No longer was thecapital of a consulting firm to be found only in its people.Running a consulting firm became a very expensive proposition. Bigcorporations like IBM and EDS saw consulting as a way of expandingtheir product and service offerings and explored different ways ofentering the field. Competition for senior level staff accelerated andexecutive search firms were kept busy by consulting firms.Experimentation with management structures and delivery mechanisms wereadditional challenges confronting consulting firms in the 1990s. Somefirms chose to centralise consulting services under one key executive.Others chose to segment by industry, service offering or geography, andyet more developed a hybrid of styles.Despite the challenges of the mid-1990s, it has been a boom time formost firms. Record revenues have been reported by many firms, and theshort-term future seems to be bright. But if history is any predictor,the pendulum will shift again!So what do I see for the future?For one thing, I foresee additional mergers between some quite largefirms with others being acquired by so-called non- traditionalcompetitors. I would not be surprised to see consulting operationsbeing spun-off to become publicly-held companies through stockofferings.Traditional partnerships are going to find it increasingly difficult toderive the financing for very large outsourcing opportunities andtechnological requirements.Lawsuits against consulting firms can also not be far off as clientsdemand higher levels of success in project implementation.And, consulting firms are going to have to devise new ways of dealingwith a diverse workforce that is more concerned with lifestyle issuesand may not be willing to accept the heavy travel schedules andworkload pressures of their predecessors.Although I am leaving ACME, I do so with a great deal of respect forour profession. Consultants are truly agents of change. As such, theycarry a great burden to operate at the very highest standards ofintegrity. Almost without exception, the consultants I have met haveborne that burden with dignity.Editor's Note: Ed plans to become a professional speaker and consultantto consulting firms.

Sandra Burke reportsFor its size, the Swiss consulting market is highly sophisticated.Switzerland has more consultants per head of population than any othercountry, reflecting in part the large number of Swiss multinationalcorporations and the foreign multinationals with European headquartersin Switzerland, all seeking top class advice.As a result, many of the international consultancies and IT providershave opened offices. They share the market with a number of independentmid-sized local firms and a large collection of sole practitioners. Thelatest arrivals in 1995 included Bossard Consultants and AmericanManagement Systems. Gemini Consulting established a presence in 1994.Despite the attractions, however, the Swiss market has some inherentproblems. Fee rates are up to 20 percent higher than in neighbouringcountries. This, together with a strong Swiss franc, has causedproblems for some consultants as clients turn to cheaper Germanconsultancies, or seek to pay in deutschmarks or dollars.Other constraints have been the lingering effects of the recession, asmall hiring pool, and the moves by many Swiss firms to relocate incheaper countries, thus obviating the need for consultants. Foreignconsultants with lower pricing structures are also entering the Swissmarket, forcing local players to discount their rates. This isespecially true in delivery areas such as SAP, according to consultantsinterviewed by MCI.Not all consultancies, however, have been affected by these trends. Thestrategy houses are doing well, reflecting the desire of major Swissmultinationals for international know-how, regardless of price.Altogether, the size of the Swiss consulting market is estimated atSKr500 million ($439 million) to SKr600 million. But the market ishighly fragmented. Turnover among the top 25 firms totalled SKr344.2million in 1994. But the three leading firms - McKinsey, Coopers &Lybrand and CSC - held about 20 percent of the market.Consultants interviewed estimated overall market growth in 1995 atbetween 5 percent and 10 percent.Performance in 1994 varied widely among the firms. The strategy houses,in particular, did well, reflecting the desire of major Swissmultinationals for international know-how, regardless of price.Switzerland is an "extremely attractive" market for Bain, said managingdirector Janet Voute-Allen. "I think what's unique to Switzerland isthat the top companies are highly international. The top 20 make a verysmall percentage of their sales in Switzerland. So, they require [aconsultancy] with an international office network," she said.Bain has 30 consultants working in Switzerland, of which 13 are basedthere. The firm plans to double its local staff so assignments can bestaffed locally. The office was established in 1990 and has seen 100percent growth per annum in the last three years, Voute-Allen said.In Switzerland, Bain is working in the retail, pharmaceutical, hightech, construction and consumer goods sectors, but not, surprisingly,in financial services although the firm is in discussions on someassignments now."We see a shift away from looking inside at costs and organisation andlooking out at growth strategies. That's good for companies and goodfor us," Voute-Allen said. "Cost optimisation is essential and mustcontinue. But it's not everything."At Coopers & Lybrand, consulting turnover doubled over the last fouryears and the firm expects growth of 18 percent to 20 percent in 1995,said Tony Haas, managing partner. Cross-border work is still a smallportion of C&L's consulting business in Switzerland but will form alarger part in future, especially on big projects, Haas said.Currently, the Swiss firm is working closely with its sister firm inGermany.The firm is well placed in the telecommunications, public sector andhealth care sector, but less strong in financial services in partbecause C&L was owned by Swiss Bank Corporation until 1991, Haas said."We are still a little bit behind [in financial services] but growing,"Haas said.KPMG reorganised its operations in 1994 after two years of flat growth(MCI 65). As a result, there was a "reduction in volume" in 1994 over1993, said Bruce Mathers, partner in charge of management consulting.Demand was higher in 1995 and the firm was hoping for a 15 percentgrowth in the consulting practice, Mathers said.As part of the reorganisation, KPMG created separate consulting groupsin banking, insurance, consulting to central and eastern Europe,standard software implementation (predominantly SAP), IT consulting(which offers advice on hardware and software selection) and corporatefinance."We are organised into smallish groups with a very clear focus on each.That was a conscious change. We used to have everyone in one managementconsulting pot. We have split it down to make sure development andmarketing activities are more focused," Mathers said.Plans to create a banking industry group which would combine audit, taxand consulting had to be shelved after the Federal Banking Commissionexpressed reservations, he said.The firm has also postponed plans to create other industry specificgroups like those in the UK and US. "They are large enough to splitinto industry specific groups. For us, that is still a couple of yearsdown the road in terms of allocating consultants to particularindustries," Mathers said.In Switzerland, KPMG is doing particularly well in corporate financeand corporate recovery work as well as in SAP and business process re-engineering, Mathers said. "What is limiting our growth is theavailability of qualified personnel," he added.Deloitte & Touche, which has the smallest consulting practice of any ofthe Big Six firms in Switzerland, reported record growth in 1994following a relaunch of the consulting operation. This was achieved inpart by hiring a team from a rival Big Six firm."Consulting firms in Switzerland have always had cyclic expansion andcontraction," said Daniel Meister, head of D&T's Swiss consultingpractice. "The Swiss firm made a decision [to expand consulting]because they felt and still feel that besides the audit potential togrow - and they see less opportunity in that area - they realise theyneed a well- managed consulting group to support them in keepingclients and adding value to clients."The 1995 acquisition of Canadian SAP specialists ICS - which had anoperation in Basel - also contributed to growth, Meister said. D&T hastargeted the health care, pharmaceuticals, financial services andlogistics/distribution sectors, he said. With ICS primarily involved inpharmaceuticals in Switzerland, "this has been a boost to ouropportunities from a re-engineering perspective", Meister said.D&T is also considering supplementing its SAP services with Oraclebusiness application skills. It is likely to retain its niche trainingservices in Word, Excel and other packages. "In Switzerland, PCtraining has always been important. It's never grown a lot but it hasadded some volume. I don't see it as strategic, but it is profitable,"Meister said.Among the Swiss firms, revenues were flat at ICME in 1994 compared with1993, according to partner Gian Saratz, although the firm showed a 7percent increase when its international revenue was taken into account.ICME offers a range of general consulting services and has subsidiariesin France and Germany. About half the clients are in banking, insuranceand telecommunications with the rest in the manufacturing, chemical andpharmaceutical sectors.Saratz blamed the recession and the firm's international focus for itslack-lustre performance in Switzerland. "The market has become muchtougher. Also, we put our strength quite a bit abroad to support ourother companies so we neglected Switzerland a bit."Helbling Management Consulting reported revenues of SKr11 million in1994 and expects to increase that to SKr13 million in 1995, accordingto Reto Muller, managing director. In addition, the firm will have SKr3million from its German operation.Muller attributed the increase to a gain in market share at the expenseof smaller Swiss consultancies. "Firms with less than SKr10 millionface difficulties," he noted. His firm, which provides strategyconsulting and counts McKinsey and The Boston Consulting Group amongits competitors, also benefits from its lower fee structure compared tothe bigger strategy firms."We have lower rates. Our daily fees are on average SKr2,700 [comparedto SKr4,000 to SKr5,000 per day at other strategy firms]. So we arestill very competitive compared to the big ones. We won three contractsagainst McKinsey and BCG in Germany and Switzerland this year. Wecompete in certain areas such as corporate restructuring, time-basedmanagement . . . We do not compete in international market studies."Helbling's target clients are companies with annual turnover of SKr20million to SKr1 billion, Muller added. In addition to the managementconsulting business, the Helbling Group has four other subsidiaries: amergers and acquisitions unit; a product design and automation unitcomprising 120 professionals, mainly engineers; an EDP companyspecialising in computer-aided design software for engineers; and anenvironmental unit, Muller said."We expect next year a lot of assignments in financial and corporaterestructuring and also a lot of profit improvement and turnaroundassignments. Also, new public management. There is an increasing demandfor those types of services," he said.SCG St. Gallen Consulting Group estimates 1995 Swiss revenues atSKr10.8 million, up 20 percent over 1994. Founded in 1984, the firm hasretained its close ties with the University of St. Gallen. In additionto its headquarters in the town of St. Gallen near the German border,the firm has an office near Geneva in the French- speaking part ofSwitzerland along with offices in Frankfurt, Leipzig and London. Totalrevenue was SKr25.7 million in 1994, nearly half of which was derivedin Switzerland. SCG is fully independent and partner-owned."We've been international from the beginning because the founders hadworked internationally. Switzerland being a small country, for growthto be obtained, it is necessary to grow internationally. If you wereonly working in Switzerland, growth would be limited," said consultantPeter Fanconi.The firm specialises in strategy but also in organisation and corporatedevelopment, management systems, marketing and sales, business re-engineering and human resources (especially management and leadership).SCG's clients are primarily in the financial services and retailsectors but the firm is increasingly working in the public sector andindustry (especially energy, IT and telecommunications).At TC Team Consult, revenues were flat in 1994. The firm specialises infour sectors: police and security, family-owned companies, the publicsector and the postal services. The Swiss holding company owns all ofthe Swiss practice plus a 5 percent to 10 percent stake in TeamConsult's subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria.Nearly three years ago, Bossard Consultants of France took a 20 percentstake in Team Consult (MCI 45) with plans to boost that to 51 percentand use TC to build a Swiss business. That appears not to haveprogressed. Bossard retains the 20 percent ownership but the firms donot work closely together and Bossard has recently opened its ownoffice in Zurich. Currently, Bossard has two people in Switzerland,although up to 20 consultants from Bossard's French office have beenworking in the French-speaking part of the country. The firm is seekinga Swiss partner, said Hans-Joachim Diedenhofen, partner in charge ofthe Swiss operation.Other Swiss firms include Hayek Engineering with estimated revenues ofSKr12.5 million; Gherzi which specialises in the textiles sector andhas estimated income of SKr18.6 million; APP Informatik which isprimarily involved in information technology; BSG in St. Gallen whichoffers strategy, organisational and IT consulting; Abegglen & Partnerswhich provides general management consulting to the services sectorincluding retail and telecommunications; and Management Zentrum, alsoin St. Gallen.Trends elsewhere are also manifest in Switzerland but with somedifferences. Recruitment, for example, can be tougher in Switzerlandthan elsewhere due to the country's small population and relativelylarge consulting market resulting in a much smaller pool of potentialrecruits. Tough laws on foreign workers also make hiring consultantsfrom elsewhere a challenge.Globalisation has not hit the local Swiss firms, but many are alreadyworking outside Switzerland, primarily in Germany."On a Swiss base, we are a large company. On a European scale, we arein the problem field," said Saratz of ICME. "We are trying to groweither by ourselves or by alliances." Besides Switzerland, ICME isconcentrating on the French, German and Austrian markets. The firm isalso doing work in Spain and Italy through a local partner, albeitmainly for Swiss, French and German clients, he said.Helbling opened its first German office four years ago and now hassmall bases in Dusseldorf, Stuttgart and Munich. After building up theGerman practice, the firm plans to expand into other countries, Mullersaid.Looking ahead, consultants anticipate increased fee pressure and ashake-out among the mid-sized firms. "Fees are always a topic,"observed KPMG's Mathers. "You certainly have to be very competitive."One company, Stiftung BWI, which was associated with the technicaluniversity in Zurich, announced in November that it would cease itsconsulting operations. The firm's 1994 turnover was SKr8.1 million,down 4.7 percent over the previous year, according to Klaus Wernihk,the interim director who is overseeing BWI's wind-up.The institute had 40 consultants and offered a range of generalservices. Fee rates were reportedly lower than at competing small andmedium Swiss firms in part because BWI could draw on students toconduct some of its economic studies.But BWI, which was created before the advent of specialty consultingand international competition, had outlived its time, Wernihk said.Some of its core activities may be spun off through management buy-outs, he added.Perhaps the greatest challenge facing consulting firms in Switzerlandis to get their transaction costs down. Some firms, like Coopers &Lybrand, have reduced their rates and in certain cases are proposingfixed fees rather than daily rates."We have to prove we offer more value for money," said C&L's Haas.While firms can command high fees for strategy advice, delivery orimplementation work is priced at a much lower level."We are between the two," Haas said. "If we work on a project finding asolution, then fees are not a problem. But on implementation, which cantake months or years, [the return is] lower.""It's up to the whole consulting industry to improve its productivity,"he added. "If we have the right mix between high and medium levelconsulting and implementation work, profitability will be sustained.It's also a function of the size of the firm. With 20, 30 or 40 people,that's dangerous. But with 100 and more, you can survive.""Clients are looking for more commodity-type support," observed D&T'sMeister. "One of the ways out is to specialise and leverage, add valuein more intense proportions. In the past, it was not unheard of thatconsulting firms customised software programmes for clients at primerates. Today, we are using objects, modules etc to bring the costdown."Others are looking beyond the current focus on implementation. "InSwitzerland, McKinsey has a very strong position on the strategic side.We don't intend to leave that area to them forever," said KPMG'sMathers."We must get closer to the decision-making area as well asimplementation, we must be able to offer the entire range.

First,to get new products to market quickly they integratemarketing, research and development, engineering,design, production, and distribution.  Second, torespond quickly to shifting demand they aim atproducing small lot sizes with minimal setup times -- apractice known as lean production.  Third, to makeevery aspect of production more visible they work withfewer more qualified suppliers and involve them inevery phase of production, from product development on.Finally, they delegate much greater operationalresponsibility to those who design and manufacture theproduct.This (RAND Corp.) report uses an intensive survey ofthe literature to describe and analyze this newmanagement paradigm.  By providing a framework forunderstanding a very complicated subject, the reportserves as a resource for managers interested in thosepractices that are shaping manufacturing and serviceindustries throughout the world.(Order this MANAGEMENT MATTERS reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

Despitepopular appeal, the fundamental claims made in theliterature remain largely unchallenged.  Like manyorganizational design concepts, there is some confusionas to what delayering means in practice, how such achange should be implemented, and what support ashorter management hierarchy requires.  This study fromEngland (Sussex University) examines the experience ofa sample of employing organizations who are or were inthe process of delayering their management structure.Eight case study organizations were visited during thecourse of the study.

It is critical that organizations takeadvantage of cost-conscious market-driven commercialproduction, and that they leverage the huge investmentsin leading-edge process technologies made by privateindustry.  It is also important that technologies andsystems keep pace with the rapid product developmentcycles.  Dual use technology policies are a keycomponent of investment strategies for maintainingperformance superiority and affordability in this newtechnological and economic defense-industryenvironment.  Elements of the dual-use technologyinvestment strategy serve to: (1) ensure that keyelements of the technology-base that are critical fornational security remain at the leading edge; (2)support the transitioning of defense-sponsoredtechnology and the integration of military productionwith the commercial base; and (3) facilitate insertionof commercial technologies into military systems.(Order this MANAGEMENT MATTERS reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

Historically, the U.S. has been Japan'sprincipal foreign source of defense material andtechnology, with annual purchases averagingapproximately $1 billion during the 1980s.  This figurecould reach $2 billion if current agreements areexecuted.  While Japan's defense procurement policiesare less explicit and organized than those of the U.S.,they have generally favored U.S. industry over otherforeign competitors.  The decline of the Soviet threat,combined with a rise in U.S.-Japanese trade friction,could result in a diminution of U.S. industry access toJapan's defense market.  There is a perception thatJapan has exploited U.S. defense technologies to buildcompetitive civilian industries, while enjoying U.S.military protection.  Despite these problems, the studyconcludes that U.S. industry's participation in Japan'sdefense market is in DOD's interest and worthcontinuing.  Pressuring the Japanese to accept areciprocal defense procurement agreement, or to adoptDOD-style procurement practices, could becounterproductive.(Order this MANAGEMENT MATTERS reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

A review of U.S. andJapanese experiences with using microelectronicsconsortia as a tool for strengthening their respectiveindustries reveals major differences.  Japan hasestablished catch-up consortia with focused goals.These consortia have a finite life targeted from thebeginning, and emphasis is on work that supports orleads to product and process-improvement-drivencommercialization.  Japan's government has played a keyrole in facilitating the development of consortia andhas used consortia to promote domestic competition.U.S. consortia, on the other hand, have oftenemphasized long-range research with considerably lessfocus than those in Japan.  The U.S. consortia havesearched for, and often made, revolutionary technologyadvancements; however, technology transfer to theirmembers has been difficult.  Only SEMATECH has assistedits members with continuous improvements involving:compressed product cycles; established relationships;and strengthened core competencies.  The U.S.government has not been a catalyst, nor has it providedleadership, in consortia creation and operation.The study proposes that, in order to regain worldleadership in areas where U.S. companies lag foreigncompetition, the U.S. should create industry-wide,horizontal-vertical, catch-up consortia, or continueexisting consortia in the six areas where the U.S. lagsbehind Japan: optoelectronics; displays; memories;materials; packaging; and manufacturing equipment.  Italso recommends that consortia be established forspecial government microelectronics and formicroelectronics research integration and application;that these consortia be managed by an industry-ledMicroelectronics Alliance whose establishment would becoordinated by the Department of Commerce; and that theSemiconductor Research Corporation, the NationalScience Foundation Engineering Research Centers, andrelevant elements of other federal programs beintegrated into this consortia complex.(Order this MANAGEMENT MATTERS reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

This may be tempting the legalfates.Congressional staffers, lawyers and researcherswho study employment and human resource issuessay those mandatory agreements may not be legaloutside the security field, and could raise ahost of potential legal liabilities, includingviolation of legislative intent, obstruction ofjustice or contempt of court charges, and civilrights violations. The agreements also raisethe specter of new federal legislationregulating employment.In addition, mandatory arbitration may not evenreduce the cost of litigation.  An extensivestudy shows that--when compared to juries--arbitrators actually favor employees more, andaward higher settlements.ARE THEY LEGAL?In Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., theSupreme Court upheld pre-employment arbitrationagreements required by the National Associationof Securities Dealers. Left unaddressed iswhether those provisions are legal in any otherindustry.Currently, cases dealing with such agreementsin nonsecurities corporations are working theirway through the courts.Critics of the corporate rush to lowerlitigation costs by having all applicants signaway their right to sue say those clauses maybe illegal. At least one prominent arbitratoragrees. "You can drawn an analogy to workers'compensation laws," he says. "Under thosestatutes, an employee cannot waive hislitigation rights -- even if he wants to doso."The critics also charge that the agreements goagainst the intent of Congress when it enactedanti-discrimination laws and statutes barringsexual harassment. Courts look to legislativeintent when ruling on legality. The GeneralAccounting Office --at the request of twolawmakers--is studying whether pre-employmentarbitration provisions "affect the enforcementof federal [employment discrimination] laws."THE INTENT ISSUESpeaking of the issue of subvertingcongressional intent, the arbitrator says,"There may be something to that." Theagreements "may constitute either willful orinadvertent subversion of civil rights." Thatis because such laws as the Civil Rights Act of1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Actand the American with Disabilities Act allcontain provisions allowing aggrieved workersto file civil suits against their employers."If we didn't want those cases to go to court,we wouldn't have included those provisions,"says a key congressional aide who helped draftsome of the statutes.The GAO study may be an omen of future laws,says Christine Keen, a principal in the DomaniGroup, a Washington research organization. Byrelying on the agreements, "corporations couldbe tempting federal legislation." Keen, who previously handled legislativeissues for the Society for Human ResourceManagement, says some state may enactlegislation banning the contracts.OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE?A former senior Justice Department officialtells us that corporations that use pre-employment arbitration contracts may be--atbest--risking contempt citations, orobstruction of justice charges in a worst-casescenario.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT POLICIES & PERSONNEL LAW via NewsNetApril 15, 1994MANDATORY ARBITRATION(CONTINUED)The official, whose views are in the minority,explains that Equal Employment OpportunityCommission guidelines require corporations toinvestigate all sexual harassment charges. He also says that some civil rights lawscontain an "affirmative obligation" on the partof employers to report discrimination chargesto investigators.  "By burying those charges inan arbitration panel," he says, employers couldbe obstructing justice.Another Justice Department alumni disagrees. "Icould see civil contempt proceedings, butobstruction of justice is creative thinking,"says the attorney who has prosecuted people forthat charge.Others note that federal agencies--includingCongress, the EEOC and the National LaborRelations Board--have said it is good publicpolicy to arbitrate rather than litigatedisputes. The prominent arbitrator agrees, butadds that those statutes and rules "aren'tanalogous to a corporation saying that--priorto employment--you have to arbitrate all future[legal] claims" and give up your right to sue.HOW ABOUT DIVERSITY?Yet another issue is diversity -- or rather thelack of it -- on securities industry panels --and its effect on discrimination claims.According to a GAO audit, 89 percent of the 726arbitrators used were white males over the ageof 60 with little employment law experience.The industry is "asking these people to dealwith problems they have never encountered andhave no experience with," says an employmentattorney. The lawyer, who currently has aclient before one of those panels, believesthat the arbitrators may not be qualified tohandle complex employment litigation.Also, this attorney says the lack of diversitycould "raise potential civil rights problems."She says that employees could argue in court orbefore federal agencies that the panels do notuse the EEOC's "reasonable woman" standard whenhearing sexual harassment claims. Thoseguidelines require that investigators and/orcorporate officials see the charges from thefemale point of view.DOES ARBITRATION WORK?Most corporations see arbitration as a way toreduce the burgeoning cost of employmentlitigation. But it may just be a placebo."Arbitration is not the Shangri-La that manythink it is," says the Domani Group's Keen. Shecites a GAO report issued earlier this month,finding that securities industry arbitratorsresolved 34 discrimination claims between 1990and 1992. Of the 18 cases looked at in depth,10 resulted in financial awards to employees;eight were decided in favor of the brokeragehouses.A study by the California State AutomobileAssociation had similar findings. While thatstudy only examined personal injury lawsuits,it came to the same conclusion: arbitrators maynot save companies money. In 45 cases where thearbitrator's award was rejected, juriesreturned lower damages 73 percent of the time.That study confirms an earlier nonpublishedexamination of a California law mandating pre-trial arbitration of suits seeking less than$50,000.BROADER ISSUES"The broader issue is whether employers andemployees can buy and sell individual rights.If you make arbitration a condition ofemployment, you're asking someone to sell offtheir right to a jury trial," Keen says. "Inthat respect, it's no different than theyellow-dog contracts of the 1930s." Before the enactment of the National LaborRelations Act, corporations required applicantsto agree never to join a union. Those so-called"yellow-dog" contracts are now illegal. "Iwould advise clients [wanting to implementarbitration agreements] to go slowly," says onelabor lawyer. "After all, if they are found tobe legal, you can always have employees signthem. If they're not [legal], why risk thepotential litigation?"The attorney may have a point. In anticipationof the upcoming GAO study, some members ofCongress are said to be drafting legislationthat would limit the use of mandatory pre-employment arbitration agreements.The following are actual cases that have beenheard by national and state courts, the NLRB orsenior arbitration panels.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT POLICIES & PERSONNEL LAW via NewsNetApril 15, 1994OSHA PROPOSES SMOKING BANAs expected, regulations proposed by theOccupational Safety & Health Administrationwould effectively ban smoking at everyworkplace in the country. The rule, whichapplies to all indoor or enclosed worksitesunder OSHA's jurisdictions, is seen as part ofthe Clinton administration's continuing anti-smoking campaign.President and Mrs. Clinton have banned smokinginside the White House. Recently the DefenseDepartment announced a no-smoking policy at allmilitary bases and offices. The same day OSHAreleased its proposal, the head of the Food andDrug Administration asked Congress for guidanceover whether to regulate nicotine as a drug.Meanwhile, the House is set to vote on a billthat would codify OSHA's proposed anti-smokingregulations into law.WHAT THE RULES SAYThe OSHA proposals, expected to take effect in1995 at the earliest, would require employers--including building owners--to either outrightlyprohibit tobacco usage or to establishdesignated smoking areas and only permitsmoking there.Smoking areas must be "enclosed and exhausteddirectly to the outside" and contain all smokewithin the room. Essentially, building ownersor employers would have to install separateventilation systems for the smoking areas. Thatwould make permitting smoking a prohibitivelyexpense proposition in many workplaces. Thelegislation currently making its way throughCongress contains a similar provision.Employees who do not smoke must not "berequired to enter [the] designated smokingareas in the performance of [their] normal workactivities." In addition, smoking would bebarred from the rooms while the ventilationsystem was being repaired.In addition to the Tobacco Institute, thebiggest opposition to the proposals is expectedto come from restaurant and bar owners, andhotel associations. The proposed regulationswould cover eateries and could force them toban smoking, according to some OSHA officials.Restaurant owners maintain that would cost themsmokers' patronage, at a time when the industryis just beginning to recover from the effectsof the recession.While the anti-smoking provisions have gottenthe most press, the indoor air quality rulegoes much further. Joseph Dear, OSHA'sadministrator, acknowledges that it "is one ofthe most extensive ever proposed."It covers what OSHA calls "building-relatedillness" (including sensory irritation,allergies, infections, humidifier fever,certain types of pneumonitis, Legionnaires'disease and chemical exposures). Employersunder the rule would keep written records ofemployment complaints, as well as "signs orsymptoms that may be related to building-related illness."The regulation--technically an indoor airquality standard--would require building ownersor corporations to submit written complianceplans, including a written maintenance programfor heating, ventilation and air-conditioningsystems.In addition, employers would be forced toconduct inspections, ventilate all fumes that"could reasonably be expected to result" inhazardous or particulate exposures to workers,keep relative humidity below 60%, and maintainrooms that have windows that open.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT POLICIES & PERSONNEL LAW via NewsNetApril 15, 1994WHAT OSHA'S SMOKING RULE REQUIRESListed below is the full text of the proposedOSHA regulation, which would ban smoking in allworkplaces. The regulation, included in theIndoor Air Quality Standard, covers "offices,educational facilities, commercialestablishments, healthcare facilities, andoffice areas, cafeterias, and break roomslocated [or] used by employees."In workplaces where the smoking of tobaccoproducts is not prohibited, the employer shallestablish designated smoking areas and permitsmoking only in such areas.The employer shall assure that designatedsmoking areas are enclosed and exhausteddirectly to the outside, and are maintainedunder negative pressure (with respect tosurrounding spaces) sufficient to containtobacco smoke within the designated area.The employer shall assure that cleaning andmaintenance work in designated smoking areas isconducted only when no smoking is taking place.The employer shall assure that employees arenot required to enter designated smoking areasin the performance of normal work activities.The employer shall post signs clearlyindicating areas that are designated smokingareas, and the employer shall post signs thatwill clearly inform anyone entering theworkplace that smoking is restricted todesignated areas.The employer shall prohibit smoking indesignated smoking areas during any period thatthe exhaust ventilation system servicing thatarea is not properly operating.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT POLICIES & PERSONNEL LAW via NewsNetApril 15, 1994IS IT AGE BIAS TO DISCHARGE A  SECRETARY WHENHER BOSS RETIRES?The following are actual cases that have beenheard by national and state courts, the NLRB orsenior arbitration panels.THE PROBLEM: Betty Moses had been JosephGriesedieck's secretary for 22 years when heretired as chairman of the board of theFalstaff Brewing Corporation. Following herboss's retirement, she was told that she wasbeing let go.Moses then sued Falstaff for violating the AgeDiscrimination in Employment Act. At the trial,Moses's attorney argued that it was age thatled to Betty Moses's dismissal. She's 48. Anemployee with her seniority, experience andknow-how could easily have been absorbed by oneof the company's departments.Falstaff countered:  *   We do not practice age discrimination. Weemploy men and women of all ages.  *   However, we have long had a consistentpolicy of eliminating the job of secretary whenan officer's functions with the company areterminated.THE ANSWER: Case dismissed. Falstaff had along-standing policy that secretaries toofficers remained with those persons when theofficers changed positions in the organization.The secretaries lost their jobs when theirbosses were eliminated or retired, the U.S.Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, found.  Neitheryoung nor old secretaries were spared when thesad day came. Betty Moses's age had nothing todo with her fate (550 F.2df 1113).COMMENT: Betty Moses would have had a strongercase if she had been able to show:  *   She was replaced by a younger person.  *   A company officer told her that age was afactor in her firing.  *   Statistical evidence showed a pattern ofage discrimination by the employer.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT POLICIES & PERSONNEL LAW via NewsNetApril 15, 1994WHAT ARE THE PITFALLS OF  OVERSELLING A JOB?THE PROBLEM:  The sudden resignation of JohnLund forced Ed Tutwiler Cadillac, Inc. to finda quick replacement. President E.M.Tutwiler IIIsought out Tim Snodgrass, who worked for arival company, and guaranteed him a substantialjump in compensation plus a bonus based on hisdepartment's profit.The division was a "money maker," Tutwilerpromised, saying that Lund had been employed onthe same basis and had done quite well. Shortlyafterward, Snodgrass quit his job and joinedTutwiler.Snodgrass soon regretted the job switch. TheTutwiler division was a money loser, not amoney maker. Not only did it lose money duringSnodgrass's brief tenure, but it also had beenheavily in the red during John Lund'sincumbency.Within three months, Snodgrass becamedisillusioned and was terminated after severalbitter quarrels with Tutwiler. Snodgrass thenstruck back at Tutwiler with a lawsuit forfraud, alleging he had been lured away from asafe job with lies about the profitability ofthe Tutweiler division and the prospect offuture earnings. Because of themisrepresentation, he lost income and wasunemployed for a considerable time, Snodgrasssaid.The employer responded that all it was guiltyof was making optimistic predictions aboutSnodgrass's future with the company. It's nocrime to build up a job's potential, Tutweilerasserted.THE ANSWER: Snodgrass wins his case. Tutwiler'seffusions about the job were more than mereoptimism, the Indiana Court of Appeals found.Tutwiler deceived Snodgrass about hispredecessor's earnings and the financialcondition of the department. Said the court:"We agree with Snodgrass that his claim forfraud is not based upon any predictions orpromises by Tutwiler as to what Snodgrass couldexpect to earn as used car manager. Rather itis based on misrepresentations regarding theused car department's financial status" (428N.E.2d 1291).COMMENT: A company does not commit fraud whenit merely paints a job with glowing colors to aprospective employee and suggests that a greatfuture may await him.

Linz was offered a data processingmanagership with Champion, but a study of theproposed job convinced him that, although histitle would be unchanged, his functions wouldbe diminished.At this point, Linz informed Champion that heregarded his job as "terminated" and herequested severance pay. When Champion rejectedthe request, Linz brought suit for theseverance pay, pointing out that under themerger agreement, all Hoerner Waldorf employeeswere entitled to severance pay if terminated.His job entailed computer programming, systemsdesign, analysis, implementation, user serviceand data processing. The Champion job wouldrequire less systems design, implementation,and programming, Linz told the court.A Champion spokesman rebutted:  *   The job it offered Linz was substantiallysimilar to the one he held at Hoerner Waldorf.The trouble is that he's too finicky.  *   Linz was not terminated; he quit of hisown accord. He doesn't merit severance pay.THE ANSWER: No severance pay for Linz; he quitof his own free will. The Montana Supreme Courtpointed to Webster's definition that"terminate" means "to put an end to; make tocease; to end." This had not been the fate ofLinz's position. The court stated:"Champion offered Linz a comparable position inhis city of residence. His salary was equal tothat he received from his position with HoernerWaldorf, with an increase scheduled soonthereafter. From these facts, we cannot findthat Linz's position was terminated" (675 P.2d979).COMMENT: An employee's right to consider aposition to be "terminated" often depends onhow a change in position is effected. Thus, anemployee's contention that his job wasterminated was upheld when he was stripped ofhis title of branch manager while his pay andduties remained unchanged. A Colorado courtfound that, without the title, the employee hadlost the respect of co-workers and clients (657P.2d 457).Back to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT POLICIES & PERSONNEL LAW via NewsNetApril 15, 1994CAN A COMPANY MAKE IT A POLICY  TO GIVE EX-EMPLOYEES A BAD RAP?THE PROBLEM: As long as employees worked forWilliam Brown's publishing company, they weretreated as friends and confidants. But anyemployee who left Brown's employ soon foundthat Brown's benevolence had changed toimplacable hostility.Thus, the wrath of William Brown descended uponPatricia Marshall who left his company afteryears of service. Marshall was on the verge ofreceiving a well-paying job with Jill Boxleyuntil Boxley telephoned Marshall's ex-bossabout a reference."Patricia Marshall was erratic in her workhabits," Brown began. "She brought her personalproblems to the office. Of course, if this thekind of employee you want..."Patricia Marshall immediately retaliated with alawsuit against the publishing company and itschief for "wrongful interference withprospective employment."At the trial, Marshall had little difficultyproving that the words attributed to Brown wereunmitigated lies. Brown took the stand andswore he had never made those comments to JillBoxley, but Boxley reaffirmed that Brown hadmade the offending remarks.THE ANSWER: Patricia Marshall wins her case;and she'll get heavy damages, too. In comparingthe differing versions of the telephoneconversation, the California Court of Appealfound Jill Boxley's to be more credible. Whatmade a strong impact on the court was testimonyby George Ryan, a one-time company supervisorwho asserted that Brown "...told me to make ita policy to give bad references to formeremployees. He'd say, 'Shoot them down inflames'"(190 Cal.Rptr.392).COMMENT: An employer who intentionallydispenses untruthful references about an ex-employee in some instances may even facecriminal charges, depending on state law.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANAGEMENT POLICIES & PERSONNEL LAW via NewsNetApril 15, 1994MUST EMPLOYEES BE REIMBURSED FOR A PAY CUT IFBUSINESS IMPROVES?The Problem: When a series of reverses put BobAdams Motors, Inc., in the red, president BobAdams called his personnel to a meeting wherehe said: "We can either fire a number of you--or we can cut everyone's pay 20 percent. Whichwill it be?"The assembled employees agreed to accept a paycut. Bob Adams thanked his employees and thenexclaimed: "If business improves by the end ofthe year, you'll be reimbursed--if possible."By the following year, business had improvedsufficiently for the company to restoresalaries to their former level, but then BobAdams sold the  business to new owners. At thispoint, the staff sued Bob Adams for"defrauding" them out of the money he haddeducted from their salaries, asserting:  * Bob Adams made us believe that the pay cutwould be reimbursed to us if business improved.He reneged on that promise. Business didimprove - but he never gave us back our money.That was fraud!Not so, countered Bob Adams. All he promisedwas that "if possible" he would repay thewages.The Answer: No reimbursement for the employees.To the Missouri Court of Appeals, Bob Adams'sremarks at the pay cut gathering were "a merepromise or expression of opinion--neither ofwhich are enforceable" (550 S.W.2d 850).COMMENT: It must be borne in mind, however,that an employer will not escape unscathed frompay restitution demands where the reductionsviolate the minimum-wage law, deny employeesovertime pay due them under the wage-hour law,or are tainted by violations of the anti-discrimination laws.At this point, the staff banded together andsued Bob Adams for "defrauding" them out of themoney he had deducted from their salaries.

Methadone, however, is only for opiate addiction. And twoother drugs, LAAM and bu prenorphine, are expected to be availablesoon for the treatment of opiate addiction."Methadone maintenance is the most effective pharmacotherapy forany drug dependence," says Thomas Kosten, M.D., a Yale Universitydrug researcher who conducts federally funded studies onpharmacological treatments for opiate dependency. Speaking at aconference last year in Washington, Dr. Kosten explains the keypoints to be remembered about methadone:To work, the daily dose of methadone must be at least 65 milligrams;the average dose given in the United States is only 45 milligrams aday --not enough, so methadone is not generally being given a fairtrial.At least two years on methadone is needed to make an impact; withany less time, "you just run people in and out, in and out" oftreatment. The 180-day detoxification authorized by the Food andDrug Administration is "not very promising."Psychosocial supports are required, not just methadone. "A juice-bardispensing station may be better than nothing at all, but not muchbetter," says Dr. Kosten. The link to primary medical care should bewithin the methadone program itself. Even though opiate addicts tendto need medical attention, they don't make an effort to get it, says Dr.Kosten.When HIV-positive opiate addicts enter methadone programs, theirimmune systems improve based on the activity level of "killer T-cells," says Dr. Kosten. Since most cities now have 20-to 40-percentHIV infection rates among injecting drug users, the AIDS-reductionaspect of methadone is important.Methadone's down side: it only affects opiates. Opiate addicts abusealcohol, cocaine, and benzodiazepines. Once on methadone, thecraving for opiates goes away, if the dose is high enough. But otherdrugs may continue to be abused; the pharmacological action ofmethadone will not help with them.Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994LAAM AND BUPRENORPHINEThe FDA has approved LAAM, which is essentially a long-actingform of methadone, for the treatment of opiate addiction. Unlikemethadone, LAAM does not need to be taken every day, reducing theneed for take-home doses. One 60-to 80-milligram dose of LAAM canbe taken every other day, says Dr. Kosten, noting that heroin addictsneed to take heroin four or five times a day. With heroin, they gethigh quickly, and they get sick quickly if they don't get more. Withmethadone, this process is slowed down. And with LAAM, it isslowed down even more.One problem with LAAM is that it has a slow induction, takingseveral days before a patient will feel okay. Since patients go througha mild heroin withdrawal while on LAAM, before the slower-actingdrug takes effect, they are likely to drop out of treatment. After all,they don't want to feel sick -- that's why they go for help in the firstplace.A solution to this problem, says Dr. Kosten, is to start people onmethadone and switch them over to LAAM. For this option to work,it means the clinic must offer both methadone and LAAM.Buprenorphine, another alternative to methadone, has the benefit ofhaving a shorter and less severe withdrawal. At a daily dose of twomilligrams, buprenorphine would prevent opiate withdrawalsymptoms. At high doses of 20 or 30 milligrams a day, it wouldactually block the effects of opiates. Buprenorphine is a painkiller invery low doses. The typical dose for an opiate addict being maintainedon buprenorphine is from 8 to 16 milligrams a day, says Dr. Kosten.Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994THE DETOXIFICATION PROBLEMWith all maintenance drugs, one thorny problem arises when a patientwants to become drug-free. Detoxification from these medications canbe uncomfortable, especially for an addict who has habitually turnedto opiates for relief from that very discomfort. Researchers are stillworking on the best ways to help patientswithdraw from maintenance medications.Naltrexone is an opiate-blocking medication which has no effects ofits own, but which prevents opiates from having any effect.Researchers had developed naltrexone with the premise that patientscould take it home, take one every morning, and know that whetherthey injected heroin or not, they would not get high. Perhaps notsurprisingly, naltrexone was a failure because of compliance problems:people didn't take it.Researchers are now working on an injectable form of naltrexone. Theinjection could be given once a month, and the blockade would lastuntil the next month's injection, says Dr. Kosten.Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994CLONIDINE, ALONE AND IN COMBINATIONClonidine helps with the severity of opiate withdrawal, but not theduration, says Dr. Kosten. For example, if methadone is stopped,withdrawal symptoms will last about two weeks. If clonidine is given,withdrawal will still last two weeks, but be somewhat less painful.However, if clonidine is combined with naltrexone, the entiremethadone withdrawal process can be accomplished in three days.In the most recent development, this approach can be used forsomeone maintained on buprenorphine. A heroin addict or amethadone maintained patient can be switched to buprenorphine, thandetoxified in a day hospital using naltrexone plus clonidine over an 8-hour period. "You can get them from opiate-dependent to drug-free inless than a day," says Dr.Kosten.Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994ONDCP, CLINTON `UNEQUIVOCALLY OPPOSED' TOLEGALIZATIONLegalizing drugs, mentioned as a possible anti-crime measure lastmonth by U.S. Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders, does not appear to bean option for this Administration. Although the Surgeon General hadonly suggested, in remarks at a National Press Club lunch, thatlegalization was worth study -- and she stressed that she was speakingfor herself only -- the Administration hastily sought to undo anyimpression that it was soft on drugs."The Administration has stated that legalization is a formula for self-destruction and that it is unequivocally opposed to any `reform' suchas this that is certain to increase drug use," said Lee P. Brown,director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. "Legalizationwould, in the Administration's view, do terrifying damage tocommunities, families, and individuals that are already being tornapart by drug availability and drug use. Any change in the currentpolicy of prohibiting drug use would seriously impair anti-drugeducation efforts, drug-free community programs, drug-free workplaceprograms, and the overall national effort to reduce the level of druguse and its consequences."The costs of prohibition, while they should not be minimized, arenowhere near the costs of legalizing drug use, said Brown.Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994FEDERAL DRUG BUDGET SMALLER THAN THAT OFCITIES AND STATESThe federal government spends less than state and local governmentson the drug effort, according to a recent survey conducted for theOffice of National Drug Control Policy. The survey, conducted by theU.S. Bureau of the Census, applies to funding for criminal justice,education, and treatment.In 1991, state and local governments spent $15.9 billion on drug-related activities, a 13-percent increase over what they spent in 1990.The federal government, on the other hand, spent $11 billion on drug-related activities in 1991."This survey demonstrates the substantial costs drug use has imposedon state and local governments," said Lee P. Brown, ONDCPdirector, in releasing the results at the start of ameeting with representatives of governors and big-city mayors lastmonth. The survey "makes clear the necessity of reducing drug useand the crime and violence associated with it," he said.Although states frequently chastise the federal equation which givesover 70 percent of anti-drug funding to law enforcement, they appearto be forced to do the same thing. The criminal justice systemaccounted for 79 percent of drug-related dollars spent by state andlocal governments, according to the survey. Treatment and education,or prevention, shared theremaining 21 percent.The National Drug Control Strategy, to be released by the ONDCPearly this year, will have more input from states and localities than ithas in past years, thanks to the two-day meeting held with governors'and mayors' representatives last month. Brown is relying on states andlocalities to continue to help fund the battle against drug abuse andcrime. But he is also giving them a chance to contribute to thedevelopment of the national strategy.The study can be obtained by contacting the Drugs and CrimeClearinghouse at (800)666-3332.Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994BETTY FORD CENTER GETS NEW CLINICALDIRECTORNancy Waite-O'Brien, a psychologist, has been named clinical directorof the Betty Ford Center.

Thestudy was conducted in California on a broad range of women who arerepresentative of the state's population. Published last year in TheNew England Journal of Medicine (Volume 329, Number 12), thestudy shows that doctors, clinics, and public health campaigns need todo more to communicate the harmful aspects of drug use duringpregnancy. The study was conducted by researchers at severaluniversities and funded by the California Department of Alcohol andDrug Programs.The study looked at drug use, including alcohol use, by anonymous,coded urine tests, administered in the hospitals prior to delivery.Smoking was based on self-reports -- in California, all deliveringwomen are supposed to be asked about tobacco use.The researchers tabulated the results by ethnic group. Black womenhad the highest prevalence rates, followed by Hispanic women. Belowis a chart showing, by ethnic group, prevalence rates.*  The percentage figures in the parentheses refer to the percentage ofbirths accounted for by each respective ethnic or racial group inCalifornia.The researchers were particularly concerned about Hispanic women.The birth rate is high for this ethnic group: although only one-fourthof women in California are Hispanic, they account for half of thebirths. In addition, language was related to drug use during pregnancy,the researchers found: one of every three women who tested positivefor alcohol did not speak English. Perhaps they are unaware of thewarning labels on alcoholic beverages, the researchers suggested. Inaddition, medical care professionals may not be effectivelycommunicating the risks of drinking during pregnancy to thesewomen. Because urine tests only measure recent drug use, actual prevalenceof drug and alcohol use during pregnancy was probably higher thanthe test results showed, the researchers said. Drug use duringpregnancy can result in low birth weight, prematurity, fetal distress,stillbirth, malformations, and neurobehavioral dysfunction, theresearchers noted.The sample size for the study was 30,000, and represented the ethnicand racial groups of the 600,000 infants delivered in the state over aone-year period ending June 30, 1992.Reprint requests for "Prevalence and Magnitude of Perinatal SubstanceExposures in California" go to William A.

The defendant, Curtis Lee Rudd, hadbeen convicted of cocaine possession based on baggies of cocainewhich had been pumped from his stomach. He claimed that theevidence was not sufficient to convict him, but the Court of Appealsof Washington, Division 2, disagreed. The court upheld the lowercourt conviction, saying Rudd's case was one ofconcealment.In concealment, the drugs are ingested or otherwise inserted into thebody in a balloon, a baggie, or a similar container, the ruling said."Rather than being assimilated into the bloodstream, the substanceremains concealed in the body until retrieved or expelled." Evidenceshowing concealment is usually sufficient to support a conviction forpossession, the court said.With assimilation, on the other hand, the drugs are swallowed,injected, or otherwise put directly into the body. The drugs enter thebloodstream, where the user loses "dominion and control" over them.Since dominion and control are the key features of possession, it isvirtually impossible to support a conviction for possession based onlyon assimilation, the court said.Rudd had swallowed the baggies in a motel bathroom while policewere trying to arrest him. Some of the bags broke in the process,however, and he felt quite ill. He told the police he had swallowed thebags of cocaine, and asked to be taken to a hospital, where hisstomach was pumped. The case is State v. Rudd, 856 P.2d 699(Wash. App. Div. 2 1993).Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994ALL NME LAWSUITS NOW RESOLVEDNational Medical Enterprises wrapped up 1993 by resolving the lastof the lawsuits against it by 13 insurance companies. The SantaMonica-based chain of psychiatric hospitals announced last month thatit had agreed to pay $90 million to settle the fraud and abuse claims.Insurance companies had charged that the company hadbilled them for inappropriate services.But NME's problems aren't over yet. There are still some patientlawsuits in Texas to be settled. And the federal government is alsoinvestigating possible health-care fraud at the company.It appears that NME may be getting out of the behavioral health carebusiness, however. Its psychiatric hospitals are reportedly for sale, andthe company is expected to focus on its community hospitals instead.Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994NATIONAL NETWORK FOR NEEDLE EXCHANGEPROGRAMSPeople interested in needle and syringe exchange programs, supportedas an AIDS reduction measure, now have access to a national network.The North American Syringe Exchange Network, headed by DavidPurchase of the Tacoma Needle Exchange, has the following goals:To bring together everyone who is interested in needle and syringeexchange, including exchangers, outreach workers, researchers,public health officials, treatment providers, and others; To disseminateinformation about needle and syringe exchange; To supportexchanges and legalization of exchanges; To help new exchangeprograms start up; To help develop model standards for exchangeprograms; and To coordinate the fourth North American SyringeExchange Convention, set for March 1-5 in Santa Cruz.To join the network, write to 535 E.

The majority of costs were due to alcohol-related diseasesand deaths. Only a fraction of costs were due to direct treatment forthe disease.Below is a chart outlining the costs of alcohol dependence. Directcosts are those for which payments are made; indirect costs are thosefor which resources, such as income, are lost.The statistics were compiled by Dorothy P. Rice, a professor in theSchool of Nursing, University of California, San Francisco.Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994EAPA ENDORSES NTC'S PRINCIPLES OF CAREAs health care reform proceeds, the National Treatment Consortiumhas been receiving endorsements of its "vision for quality care,"formally adopted by the group last year as part of the lobbying effortto make addiction treatment a core benefit. Most recently, theEmployee Assistance Professionals Association has signed on to theprinciples, which are based on "building bridges," in the words ofNTC executive vice president Jeffrey Kramer. "A partnership needsto be established for a viable, effective, efficient system of care,"Kramer told SAR.The principles which are incorporated in the NTC's "vision" havebeen sent to Congress, to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and to othersinvolved in trying to keep treatment available and accessible. Theendorsement of EAPA expands the vision beyond that of treatmentproviders into the workplace. The principles are listed below.1.We Are in the Business to Save LivesWe no longer can afford to perpetuate systems that primarily serve tomaintain their own existence. This occurs in both the public andprivate sector and exists among all factions of the health care purchaseand delivery system. We need to create a system that has the primeobjective of building healthy productive lifestyles.2.Speak the Same LanguageUniversal operational definition of medical necessity and patientplacement criteria are needed to effectively work together. Suchcriteria must require ongoing evaluation and field testing and thedevelopment process must include the perspective of payers,purchasers and providers. We need to continue to promote ideas thatfocus on consensus and common concerns and serve to bring all thefactions of the health care system on the same level playing field.Specifically, managed care and treatment providers need to have thesame regulations in managing and providing care.3.Alcoholism and Drug Addiction is a DiseaseThis is a fundamental mandate and it is our responsibility to provideclear straightforward information to the general public on thebiopsychosocial elements of the disease.4.Implement Models for a Continuum of CareWe must build bridges between the efforts to educate, prevent,intervene and treat addiction. Educational efforts should increase theunderstanding of the biopsychosocial aspects of the disease and thedifference between having the disease of addiction and abusing alcoholand other drugs. Prevention activities should include a focus on thebiomedical features of addiction and, when early signs of the diseasesurface in the community, efforts should be made to promote earlyintervention and treatment. Intervention and treatment must improvetheir quality. They must be able to serve more people who needtreatment at a reasonable cost while at the same time ensure that theservices provided have the desired effect.5.Include Primary Health Care in the Efforts of Early Detection,Intervention, and Treatment of AddictionIt is necessary to include physicians, nurses and other primary healthcare professionals to assist in early detection, intervention andtreatment of addiction.6.Research Efforts Must Explore Causes of AddictionResearch initiatives should be directed to identify the biopsychosocialcauses of the disease. An effective partnership must be developedbetween the research and service provider communities to applyresearch findings and work together to develop effective diagnostic andtreatment tools to improve the quality of care. Any partnershipbetween the science and the service communities could also serve todevelop innovative treatment models that are effective with patientswho do not recover using traditional approaches.7.Public Policies Should Emphasize These PrinciplesAddiction is a public health problem, and more support is needed toeffectively educate about, prevent, intervene with, and treat it. Thefederal government should adopt the fundamental mandate indeveloping its policies and help create effective models of care. Tobegin the process, federal funding for demand reduction should begiven priority status equal to that given to supply reduction. Second,more priority should be placed on funding research that examinescauses and cures of addiction. Third, policies should be developed tobroaden access to treatment, including those encouragingpublic/private treatment partnerships.8.Create Incentives to Work TogetherPayers, purchasers and providers need to see the value in buildingbridges and working together to create effective and efficient modelsof care. We must create systems that integrate effective and efficientways of managing costs while at the same time providing the mostappropriate level of care. The value of the health care dollar is abalance between efficiency and efficacy.9.Use Quality Improvement TechniquesPayers, purchasers and providers must serve the best interests of thepatient. Quality improvement techniques can improve the efficiencyand efficacy of paying for, purchasing and providing treatment. Weshould promote the use of quality improvement in managing andproviding care, as well as quality improvement in developing anorganized system of working together.10.Build Bridges with the Medical and Mental Health CommunitiesInvite the medical and mental health communities to adopt the tenetslisted above and join us in the effort to improve the quality oftreatment.For more information, contact Jeffrey Kramer at the NationalTreatment Consortium, 444 North Capitol Street, Suite 642,Washington, DC 20001; (202)434-4783.Back to Headline List CopyrightSUBSTANCE ABUSE REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1994OKLAHOMA SEEKING DIRECTOR OF SUBSTANCEABUSE PROGRAMSThe Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance AbuseServices is seeking a Director of Substance Abuse Programs.

The first two standards, one on prepress/imaging,and one on press, are now available. The finishing anddistribution skill standard will be available shortly.Forty industry representatives of graphic arts firms,associations, union, and education were members of the ProjectPolicy Committee that directed the project. Over 1,200industry practitioners from throughout the U.S. spent hundredsof hours developing and validating the standards.This Skills Standards Project was funded by the U.S.Department of Education (DOE). One half of the $516,127 grantwas received at the start of the project in 1992, while thebalance was funded by the DOE in March of 1994.The skill standards grants were originally launched by theBush Administration. The Clinton Administration then includedthe skill standards project as-a key part of its Goals 2000initiative act which was signed into law in March of 1994.The legislation includes provisions to establish a NationalSkill Standards Board to oversee the implementation ofvoluntary industry-based skill standards.Initially, the printing industry was only one of sevenindustries designated for a skills study of such magnitude,but since the GATF project began, funding has been madeavailable to fifteen additional industries by the DOE and theDepartment of Labor (DOL). Some of the other industriesinclude travel and tourism, computer-aided drafting,biotechnical sciences, health science and technology,electronics, retail trade, and metalworking.The skills standards are available for sale for $20 each, oryou may order all three standards for $49.

Cantwell, Grant Thornton's national director for manufacturing andpartner in charge of the study. "This holds true not only for theworld's industrial and retail powerhouses, but for midsizemanufacturers, which often supply materials, components, orfinished product to the biggest companies. While technology is anenabler, it is not the solution unless companies engage in meaningfulbusiness planning and processes." The following are among thestudy's key findings.Quality and customer service remain the two most competitivefactors for US manufacturers. Executives are twice as likely to cite asreasons for their success either high-quality products (38%) orsuperior service (33%) rather than cost-efficiency (17%) or rapidproduct development (12%). However, the report states that speedand agility will ultimately become a vital requirement for midsizemanufacturers, as their major customers move toward "masscustomization"--a made-to-order strategy offering greater productoptions for the mass market. To realize this goal, 78% of midsizecompanies are reducing product cycle times by streamlining productdesign or reducing the number of component parts.A clear majority (87%) of midsize companies have reengineered atleast one business process, most often in the production area (72%);and 40% of the manufacturers rate the results of their reengineeringefforts as outstanding or excellent.The majority of midsize manufacturers describe as average theircompanies' use of technology in a variety of areas. However, 52%plan to spend nearly an average of $500,000 in 1995 on newsystems, software, and telecommunications equipment. Despite theavailability of various techniques and technologies for enhancinginventory management, 40% of midsize manufacturers report theirinventories are higher than they were two years ago. Most sayhigher stocks are required to meet customer demands for rapidresponse.In the wake of various regional and global trade agreements, 72%indicate they will place higher emphasis on developing foreignmarkets for their products through such means as exporting andjoint ventures. Moreover, 72% of the companies that are pursuing orplan to receive ISO 9000 certification report they will do so becausetheir customers expect or require it.Sincerely,Peter Adrian, EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightMANUFACTURING AUTOMATION via NewsNetJanuary, 1996MCAD/CAM, CAE SOFTWARE MARKET TOPS $2.5 BILLION IN 1995Worldwide revenues for mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software willexpand at a scintillating 18.2% rate in 1995 to exceed $2.5 billion,compared to over $2.1 billion in 1994, according to Daratech, Inc.(Cambridge, MA, 617-354-2339). (See Figure 1).The growth in the CAD/CAM, CAE software arena is being propelledby a strengthening global economy, fueling capital investment bymanufacturing firms. Simultaneously, flagship software productsfrom many major vendors are generating sanguine demand fromcustomers in various geographical regions. Many of the productshave benefited from significant technology renewal and functionalenhancements in such areas as solids and assembly modeling,EDM/PDM integration, and ease of use. Such products now appearcapable of realizing the visions promised by their developers, andare gaining the confidence of users. Therefore, manufacturing firmsseeking to improve their design and manufacturing productivity andboost their global competitiveness, are adapting these products inrecord numbers.Global mechanical CAE software revenues are forecast to increase14.4% in 1995 to reach $355 million, from $310 million in 1994. Thegrowth in the MCAE software segment is driven by the efforts ofmajor analysis software vendors, such as MacNeal-Schwendler andANSYS, to transcend the engineering analysis market and penetratethe much broader design engineering arena. Moreover, such vendorsare working to enable closed-loop design optimization by furnishingbidirectional associativity between their analysis tools and leadingCAD software products.For example, Parametric Technology Corporation (Waltham, MA)plans to tighten the integration of Pro/ENGINEER with its recentlyacquired MECHANICA design optimization software over the nextseveral Pro/E release cycles, with the aim of achieving fullbidirectional associativity. EDS Unigraphics (Maryland Heights, MO)and MacNeal-Schwendler have partnered to deliver "closed-loopassociativity" between CAD/CAM and CAE software for Unigraphicsand MSC/NASTRAN users. SDRC (Milford, OH) has long emphasizedthe high level of integration between the modeling and analysisfunctions within its I-DEAS suite of design and analysis software.Parametric Technology is projected to be the growth leader in 1995among the leading mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software suppliers. Thecompany's mechanical software revenues are forecast to grow 43.2%to $313.9 million in1995, compared to $219.2 million in 1994, as itrapidly gains ground on IBM, which remains in first place.Parametric is forecast to be the number three software supplier inthe mechanical CAE arena in 1995, as a result of its acquisition ofRasna Corporation and the latter's MECHANICA product line formechanical design synthesis. Parametric's MCAE software revenuesare projected to exceed $31.4 million in 1995, representing aspectacular 86.3% increase over the estimated revenues of $17.1million for MECHANICA in 1994.Among the key factors driving Parametric's growth in 1995 and1996 are the aggressive expansion of the company's worldwide salesorganization, accelerating sales of its flagship Pro/ENGINEERsoftware, and robust product sales in all major geographic areas. Thesales growth is also being spearheaded by what Parametric perceivesas a global trend among manufacturers to invest in tools andtechnologies to increase productivity and capture a competitiveadvantage.IBM/Dassault Systemes (Armonk, NY/Suresnes, France) is expectedto be the premier supplier of mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software in1995, as its mechanical revenues derived from sales of CATIA andCADAM software increase 27% in 1995 to $410.4 million, comparedto $323.1 million in 1994. IBM/Dassault notes that the growth inCATIA sales in 1995 and continuing into 1996 will be fueled by suchkey factors as Dassault's increased technical and marketing supportof IBM's North American sales force with respect to CATIA, successin major automotive accounts, and increased revenue contributionfrom the Asia/Pacific region.Market acceptance of CATIA has increased, as the product'scompetitive strengths have markedly improved over the past 18months, according to IBM/Dassault. The product's new architectureallows CATIA developer Dassault to deliver software upgrades everyfour months; and the company says the processes are now in place tomeet this aggressive release schedule. Dassault reports that Release4.1.5 of CATIA is the fifth major product release in 18 months, andincreases the total number of CATIA products by 60% over theprevious release. Dassault expects that frequent product upgradeswill allow for more rapid enhancement of CATIA's functionalityacross a broad range of applications, thereby enhancing the product'scompetitive position.IBM/Dassault also reports expanding market acceptance of CATIA onHewlett-Packard workstations, with about 50 customers having thusfar installed CATIA on HP hardware, many of them new CATIAaccounts.Autodesk, Inc. (San Rafael, CA), the projected leader in overall 1995CAD/CAM, CAE software revenue, is forecast to be the number threesupplier of mechanical software, as its mechanical CAD/CAM, CAEsegment revenues increase 20.4% in 1995 to $230.5 million,compared to $191.5 million in 1994. The company reports thatupgrade revenue from AutoCAD Release 13 has driven a significantportion of its growth in 1995, along with incremental sales ofAutoCAD to new customers. Sales of Autodesk's WorkcenterEDM/PDM software and data publishing products are also expected tocontribute to the company's software growth in 1995.Autodesk's Mechanical Desktop offering, announced in September1995 and slated for shipment in late 1995 or early 1996, ischaracterized by the company as heralding its most aggressive pushinto the mechanical market. Autodesk's mechanical revenue growthin 1996 will likely be driven by sales of this product, and third-partyapplications provided by the company's dozen MechanicalApplications Initiative partners. Autodesk notes that the partnerswill deliver a range of complementary, fully integrated applicationsfor analysis through manufacturing that will possess the same lookand feel as Mechanical Desktop.The forecast is based on Autodesk's November 6, 1995announcement that its net revenues for the quarter ending October31, 1995 will be lower than anticipated due to weak sales in AsiaPacific and Latin America, slower than expected upgrade revenuefrom AutoCAD Release 13, and an unfavorable currency impact dueto fluctuations in the US dollar. The company believes such factorswill persist into the fourth quarter, but is optimistic that the launchof several new products late in the quarter and in the followingquarter will drive revenue growth in 1996. Before theannouncement, Autodesk's mechanical software revenues wereforecast to rise 26.7% to $242.6 million.Structural Dynamics Research Corporation (SDRC) is projected to bethe sixth-ranked supplier of mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software in1995, with its mechanical software revenues growing 20.4% to$134.1 million, compared to $11.4 million in 1994, reflecting useracceptance of the latest version of I-DEAS Master Series, Release 2.1.The company, moreover, is projected to be the number two supplierof mechanical CAE software, as its MCAE software revenues expand20% in 1995 to $37.5 million, compared to $31.3 million in 1994.SDRC reports its software growth in 1995 and into '96 will bepropelled by greater use and integration of EDM/PDM withCAD/CAM, CAE software, a more highly leveraged and expandeddistribution model, and support of its flagship solids modelingsoftware on Windows NT platforms. The company, which is currentlyshipping I-DEAS Master Series software for Windows NT/Intel-basedsystems, also anticipates boosting its revenues by gaining morerepeat business from its existing customer base.EDS Unigraphics is projected to be the fifth leading supplier ofmechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software in 1995, increasing itsmechanical software revenues 14.9% to $199.4 million, compared to$173.5 million in 1994. The company reports that the trend towardperforming large-scale, complex design and manufacturing workamong large manufacturing companies is providing it with a plethoraof sales opportunities in the area of CAD/CAM, CAE, EDM/PDM  andrelated implementation services. EDS UG expects other groups withinEDS to provide the Unigraphics division with a heightened level ofsuch opportunities in the near future. An additional factor drivingEDS UG's software growth in 1995 is the recovery of the automotiveand aerospace industries, which account for a large share of thecompany's business.Computervision Corporation (Bedford, MA) is forecast to be thefourth-ranked mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software provider in 1995,with its mechanical software revenues rising 10% to $215.6 million,compared to $196.0 million in 1994. Moreover, CV is projected to bethe number five supplier of mechanical CAE software in 1995,increasing its MCAE revenues 10% to $32.3 million, compared to$29.4 million in 1994. Throughout much of 1995, CV maintained itsfocus on cost reduction and profitability, while expanding their coremechanical software and services business.Closing major sales opportunities will be a key factor enablingComputervision to meet or exceed projected revenue increase in1995. CV's growth will also be fueled by a expanding number of salesopportunities in CAD/CAM and EDM/PDM, and by the company'simplementation of its electronic product definition (EPD) strategy forhelping major manufacturers achieve concurrent engineering, digitalproduct development, and total product life-cycle management.Revenues derived from applications based on CV's Pelorus productarchitecture are also expected to contribute to the company'ssoftware revenue growth.Prominent manufacturers from North America, Europe, and thePacific Rim will convene in Boston, Massachusetts on March 4-6,1996 to hear CEOs from the CAD/CAM, CAE and EDM/PDM industry,including Steven Walske, Chairman & CEO, Parametric TechnologyCorporation; James Meadlock, Chairman & CEO of IntergraphCorporation; Russell Planitzer, Chairman & CEO, ComputervisionCorporation; Bernard Charles, president, Dassault Systemes S.A., andothers explain their companies' strategies for computer-aidedengineering and manufacturing.The discussions, which are part of Daratech's CAD/CAM, CAE andEDM/PDM Strategy Workshops '96, will focus on how users shouldupdate, revalidate, or completely reformulate their CAD/CAM, CAEand EDM strategies to conform to contemporary technological andbusiness realities. This requirement has increasingly pressing in thelight of the significant advances in technology and the emergence ofthe Internet and EDM/PDM as major factors impacting end-users'CAD/CAM, CAE strategies.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANUFACTURING AUTOMATION via NewsNetJanuary, 1996PDM CONFERENCE '96 WILL HELP CONTROL PRODUCT DATA ANDDOCUMENTSCIMdata's sixth annual PDM Conference, regarded as a major event inthe rapidly-expanding Product Data Management (PDM) industry,will be held April 9-11, 1996 in Boca Raton, FL. The conference isexpected to attract nearly 1,000 delegates and more than 30suppliers of PDM-related systems and services.PDM Conference '96 will focus on the ways organizations use PDM tocontrol vast quantities of swiftly changing product data anddocuments, thereby improving information flow, collaboration amongfunctional groups, and the speed of bringing products to themarketplace. Exhibits of commercial systems by leading PDMsuppliers will be featured throughout the conference, which willconsist of one day of tutorials followed by two days of conferencesessions.The conference agenda includes discussions of PDM system selectionand implementation, integration issues, user experiences, technologyand industry trends, multi-industry applications, quality supportefforts, certification requirements, and configuration management.The cost is US$895 for the two-day conference, and an additionalUS$400 for the one-day tutorials.PDM serves as a tool to help engineers and others manage data aswell as the product development process. Systems keep track of thereams of data and information required to design, build, support,distribute, and maintain products. Encompassing the repertoire ofsystems that manage product definition information, PDM is ageneral extension of a wide range of techniques frequently referredto as engineering data management (EDM), document management,product information management (PIM), technical data management(TDM), technical information management (TIM), image management,etc.Ed Miller, CIMdata's president, notes that the information managedby PDM includes electronic documents, digital files, and databaserecords. "This type of product information usually pertains tomanufactured items, such as automobiles, aircraft, office equipment,consumer products, and home appliances," Miller explains. "Otherindustries also apply the technology in a more general sense of theterm 'product' so that PDM reaches across a broad expanse ofenterprises. Some of these include projects in the constructionindustry, such as buildings and highways, oil refineries and othertypes of process plants, complex facilities including airports andwarehouses, and distribution networks for electrical, gas, and otherutilities."The global PDM market is forecast to expand at about a 33% annualrate to reach about $636 million in 1995, compared to $478 millionin 1994, according to CIMdata.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANUFACTURING AUTOMATION via NewsNetJanuary, 1996TELEDYNE BROWN GARNERS GRANT TO DEVELOP NEW LASER TOOLSTECHNOLOGYTeledyne Brown Engineering has received a US CommerceDepartment grant for cross-shared funding for optics technologyresearch and development. Teledyne Brown and Utilase Systems(Detroit, MI) joined SDL, Inc. (San Jose, CA) to develop technology fora new generation of laser-based cutting and welding tools that aremore versatile, less bulky, and less expensive to purchase andoperate than those currently available. The new technology promisesto enable laser-based materials processing to penetrate considerablymore manufacturing niches in the automotive assembly line.Led by SDL, the team is one of 44 selected in five key technologyareas for the Commerce Department's annual Advanced TechnologyProgram (ATP) Awards--a program designed to catalyze economicexpansion and job creation. The ATP supports strategic, high-riskresearch in cutting-edge technologies; and awards projects based ontheir scientific and technical merit and potential benefit to the USeconomy.The team received one of 15 awards presented in the Motor VehicleManufacturing Technology category. Teledyne Brown's role entailsdeveloping optical systems to enhance the performance andefficiency of lasers in material processing systems, thereby reducingcosts for US automobile manufacturers."SDL's decision to select Teledyne Brown Engineering as a majorcontributor to this effort is an acknowledgment of our leadership inthe field of micro-optics," declared Paul Fileger, Teledyne Brown'smanager of electro-optics. "The ATP award demonstrates not onlythe significance of our technology, but is evidence of the trendtoward laser-based systems i material processing."The team members will receive nearly $3.6 million to matchcompany funding for research and development of the new lasertools. The Department of Commerce committed over $188 millionthrough the Advanced Technology Program in 1995.Bruce Peters, production manager, Electrooptics Products Group atTeledyne Brown told Manufacturing Automation  that the overallsystem developed by the researchers will use the brightness andmodularity of an array of laser diodes to replace CO2 and Nd:YAGlasers in welding and cutting applications. The advantages of suchlaser diodes include reduced costs and enhanced longevity. SDL willprovide the laser diodes and system packaging; and Utilase, whichsupplies laser-based systems for machining and welding applications,will provide the parameters and system requirements necessary forsatisfying customers.Teledyne Brown will work with SDL on aligning an array of microlenses (that are on the order of several hundred microns indiameter) with an array of laser diodes used in the system.According to Peters, the first building block of the overall system willbe demonstrated by the end of 1996. The modular building blockwill consist of a laser diodes or an array of diodes, an optical system,and fixturing. With more than 40 years of experience in supplyingoptical products and systems for the Defense Department, TeledyneBrown (Huntsville, AL, 205-726-2429) has developed acomprehensive range of optical products with broad commercialapplications.Demand for laser diodes in the US is forecast to rise at a 7.6% annualrate to reach $140 million in 2000, from $90 million in 1994,according to The Freedonia Group, Inc.'s (Cleveland, OH, 216-921-6800) Flat Screen Displays & Other Optoelectronics  report (#728).Global revenues for laser machine tools are forecast to increase at a7.1% compound annual rate to approach $1.3 billion in 1999,compared to $803.1 million in 1992, according to Frost & Sullivan'sWorld Standard and Special Machine Tool Markets  report (920-10).Revenues for 1996-1998 are placed at about $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion,and $1.2 billion, respectively.Worldwide unit shipments of laser machine tools are projected torise at an 8.7% compound annual rate to total 3,941 in 1999, from2,193 in 1992. Unit shipments during 1996-1999 are pegged at2,986, 3,268, and 3,589, respectively.In 1996, the projected distribution of the total laser machine toolrevenues by product type is: CO2 lasers-64.0%; and Nd:YAG-36.0%.The projected distribution in 1999 is: CO2-62.7%; and Nd:YAG-37.3%.Revenues for the US laser machine tools market are forecast toexpand at a 6.8% compound annual rate to reach $264.9 million in1999, as opposed to $167.5 million in 1992. Revenues for 1996-1998are projected at $212.9 million, $228.0 million, and $245.5 million,respectively.In 1996, the projected end-user industry distribution of the totalrevenues for the laser machine tools market is (all figures arerounded): automotive-37.0%; industrial/electrical machinery andequipment (I/EME)-22.4%; aerospace/defense-20.8%; and "other"(including medical equipment and precision instrument suppliers,shipbuilding, and railroads)-19.9%.

AUS Department of Energy national laboratory managed by theUniversity of California, the Berkeley Lab conducts unclassifiedscientific research.Berkeley Lab researchers Xiao-Dong Xiang, Peter Schultz (who is alsoa professor of chemistry at UC Berkeley) et. al. published theirfindings in the October 13 issue of Science. The researchers initiallydescribed their combinational technique for discovering new solid-state materials with novel physical or chemical properties--particularly their methodology allowing for the parallel synthesis ofspacially addressable arrays containing superconducting copperoxide thin films--in the June 23 issue of Science."The technique is a powerful way to examine a broad base ofadvanced materials," Xiang explained. "Magnetoresistant materialsare just the first."Combinational synthesis (involving thin-film deposition and physicalmasking techniques) purportedly enables materials scientists tocreate thousands of complex materials in the time it typically takesto create one. In the technique, materials are laid down in acheckerboard arrangement, as thin squares arranged in a grid.Different metal ingredients are stenciled onto the grid through cut-out "masks." Each square in the grid receives a different combinationof metals, owing to the different cut-outs used for each ingredient.Heat treatment mixes the ingredients and creates a grid of stablecompounds--a "combinatorial library." The materials can be scannedfor interesting electrical properties with a matched set of contactpins. Xiang and Schultz have demonstrated that they can put asmany as 10,000 different hi-tech materials into a single square-inchlibrary.The MR compounds in the study are members of a class of materialsknown as perovskite oxides--conductive metal crystals comprised ofcomplex ratios of four to six metal atoms. Their many-atom structurerenders them especially suited for combinational study. Interestingmaterials in such classes are generally discovered by substitutingatoms in an already known compound or changing the ratios of theexisting atoms. Using a combinatorial strategy, scientists can look atmany atom substitutions and ratio adjustments in a singlecombinatorial library.To search for new materials with magnetoresistance, the researchersbegan with a well-studied class of MR materials based on manganeseoxide. They substituted similar elements from the periodic table--iron, vanadium, and cobalt--for manganese, and made a separatecombinatorial library for each one. The researchers achieved successwith the cobalt oxide library, which yielded 26 new MR materials.Such materials showed resistance changes as high as 72%, renderingthe cobalt oxides similar to the so-called "colossal" class of MRmaterials. Colossal MR materials lose a great deal of their resistancein magnetic fields, some as much as 99.99%.Although the phenomenon is still not well understood, scientistssuspect that magnetoresistance is associated with a physicalcharacteristic known as spin polarization, which affects how electronscan be passed back and forth between neighboring atoms. Atomswith similar spin polarizations are much more likely to transferelectrons between one another than those with different spinpolarizations. It is thought that magnetism aligns the spinpolarization in MR materials, thereby allowing electrons to jumpmore freely between atoms, causing the resistance in a material todecrease.Previously, combinatorial approaches have been used successfully byresearchers in the life sciences who have searched for potentialdrugs by screening vast libraries of protein combinations. Xiang andSchultz are purportedly the first to apply the philosophy to solid-state materials.Xiang told Manufacturing Automation  that the new MR materialscould potentially be used in disk drive sensor heads, as well as inother types of sensors to detect magnetic fields. He adds that colossalMR materials have potential for considerably enhancing thesensitivity of magnetic sensors and increasing the areal density ofmemory devices.Civilian, open global demand for magnetic field sensors are forecastto increase at a 3.9% average annual rate during 1991-2001 to reach828.1 mil. DM (about $552.1 million at the exchange rate of 1.50 DMfor the dollar) in 2001, compared to 565.3 mil. DM (about $376.9million) in 1991 and 679.2 mil. DM (about $452.8 million) in 1996,according to Intechno Consulting AG's (Basel, Switzerland) SensorMarkets 2001  report. An updated version of the report is nowavailable.In 1996, the application area distribution of the total civilian, openmagnetic field sensor market is: professional instruments-92.0 mil.DM (about $61.3 million); consumer electronics-299.2 mil. DM (about$199.5 million); and EDP office equipment-288.0 mil. DM (about$192.0 million).

(Albuquerque,NM, 505-881-4121) has received a $4.2 million equity investmentfrom Rainbow Technologies, Inc. (Irvine, CA). The financingagreement, signed in September, affords the opportunity toimplement QMI's plan to build a commercial prototype system andbegin validation studies with customers. Quantum's high energypulsed ion beam technology for efficient, low-cost surface treatmentof materials was developed by two Sandia National Laboratoriesscientists--Regan Stinnett and Eugene Neau--who, with assistancefrom Technology Ventures, formed QMI."It's amazing to us," Stinnett exclaimed. "And, while we have to givecredit to many people, including the management at the labs fortheir encouragement, none of it would have been possible withoutTechnology Ventures Corporation. They were the key to thecommercialization process.""We are proud to be part of this success," stated Sherman McCorkle,president of Technology Ventures. "We believe it represents the bestefforts of our staff and the best and highest use of our resources."Technology Ventures Corp. is a non-profit organization dedicated tosuccessfully commercializing technology from Sandia NationalLaboratories. In operation for slightly more than two years, thecompany has already assisted in the successful transfer of more thana half-dozen such technologies, thereby offering a vital link for thelab's scientists and engineers to the business and investment world.'Technology Ventures is a true innovation in the world of technologycommercialization," declared Paul Robinson, Sandia Laboratories'president and director. "Founded by Lockheed Martin Corporation asa conduit for moving technology out of the labs and into the privatesector, this type of success demonstrates a breath and depth ofabilities that are more than enough to accomplish its goals." Stinnettnotes that Technology Ventures assisted the two entrepreneurs inorganizing the business effort from the ground up after recognizingthe significant commercial potential of the technology.The chemical-free, commercial scale Ion Beam Surface Treatment(IBEST) technology upon which QMI was formed uses repetitivelyhigh average power pulsed ion beams to efficiently deposit energy inthe top 2-50 micrometers of the surface of a material, and wasdeveloped at Sandia at a cost of more than $20 million. (See Figure2). The technology, protected by six patents pending, uses short,intense beams of ions to melt or treat metal, ceramic, glass, or plasticsurfaces in less than one millionth of a second. The controlled iondeposition in a thin surface layer is followed by rapid cooling at up toone billion degrees per second. As of mid-December 1995, QMI isvery close to completing negotiations with Sandia for the license toIBEST technology.QMI's rapid quenching technique--which uses a unique diodedesigned by Cornell University for emitting the beam--has been usedto melt and resolidify metals and ceramics for various potentialindustrial applications, including gear teeth for a major automotivemanufacturer. The process has demonstrated its ability to increasethe lifetime of tools by up to threefold, reduce corrosion of metals byup to a factor of 100, polish and make surfaces nearly defect free,and increase the bonding properties of plastic surfaces.QMI's technology environmentally-friendly technology has potentialapplications in many areas, including the tool-and-die industry,aircraft manufacturing, automobile engines, medical implants andtools, microelectronics fabrication, and even razor blades andcookware.A market analysis by KMPG Peat Marwick has confirmed theattractiveness of the technology for the aircraft industry, tools anddies, and polymer surfaces. For example, metal and ceramic dies canrange in cost from $5,000 to $50,000. Treating even the largest diewould cost less than a dollar, but could double its lifetime. Similaradvantages could be provided for hardware utilized in suchapplication areas as automobile engines, microelectronics fabrication,and aerospace. QMI's technology costs only a few cents per squarefoot in high process rate applications."We look for 'root' technologies--those that have many applications,that provide the greatest impact," noted Bob Gibson, TechnologyVentures' director of equity funding who spearheaded the businessdevelopment effort for Stinnett and Neau. "This technology isdefinitely a root technology. It has many applications. It can beapplied to high-value items, such as hardening an artificial joint usedin hip replacements. Right now, such a joint may last 10 years beforereplacement. With this technology, it could last up to 30 years. It canalso be used in a variety of high-volume applications, and in thefuture may even have uses in the purification and pasteurization offood."Fueled by such potential, Technology Ventures helped the scientistsform QMI and develop a business plan that would "make a businessout of the technology," Stinnett commented. Technology Ventureshelped the pair identify markets, map out a strategy that wouldattract investors, and then introduced them to the investorsthemselves.Gibson introduced the scientists to a dozen qualified investors, manyof which attended Technology Ventures' Equity Capital Symposiumlast May in Albuquerque. The introductions resulted in four writtenoffers, and QMI selected the deal with Rainbow Technologies."Technology Ventures kept us out of shark-infested waters," Stinnettexplained. "Because of them, we were able to hook up with the rightkind of investors.""Rainbow is a qualified equity investor," Gibson noted. "This meansthey have a long-term interest in the technology and in the company.And, Rainbow is itself a solid technology company with an 11-yearhistory and a strong cash position. Currently, their main product is insoftware security."QMI represents an "outstanding investment opportunity," statedWalter Straub, Rainbow's CEO and president. "We are excited aboutthe opportunity to invest in a company and technology with suchsignificant commercial potential."Technology Ventures--which screens such opportunities as carefullyfor the investment community as it screens investors for itscompanies--encouraged Rainbow to pay close attention to QMI. Inthe earlier stages of the commercialization process, TechnologyVentures helped incubate QMI by providing free office space andrelated services, and contributing $10,000 in seed funding."But, we got a lot more than money and office space from them,"Stinnett highlighted. "When we had to move quickly, to keepinvestment interest alive, Technology Ventures helped us do that.They started working with us in March, and now we have a completepackage, complete with financing. We wouldn't have been even closewithout Technology Ventures."However, Gibson credits the scientists for their willingness to enterthe business fray. "The toughest part of finding money is findingpeople who are willing to do the things an investor needs to completethe due diligence process. Stinnett and Neau have been a total joy towork with. Not only are they world-class scientists, they have anextraordinary commitment to making the business work."Stinnett told Manufacturing Automation  that Rainbow has providedQMI with seed funding to complete the process of obtaining a licensefor the technology, and that Rainbow is committed to providefunding to bring the technology to the commercialization stage.According to Gibson, it is anticipated that there will be a series offield use licenses for the technology. Such technology is availablethrough QMI as a package, including an exclusive global license to theentire technology, the scientists who developed it, and OEMs who canmanufacture the required subsystems.The value of worldwide shipments of polymers for surfacemodification is forecast to increase at an 11.2% average annual rateto exceed $3.1 billion in 1998, compared to over $1.8 billion in 1993,according to Business Communications Company, Inc.'s SurfaceModification of Polymers  report (K4P-214).

The alliance willfurnish in-depth information concerning key trends in logistics tobusinesses contemplating revamping their logistics processes.The two organizations will begin the design and methodology of thesurvey this month. During the past three years, KPMG has surveyedabout 300 companies to benchmark logistics operations. With thealliance, plans call for expanding the survey to encompass severalthousand manufacturing and retail companies, allowing for a morecomprehensive view of logistics planning and trends.Tom Mentzer, Bruce Excellence Chair of Business Policy at theUniversity of Tennessee, notes that the research will scrutinize themain trends impacting business planning for logistics, including theaffect of technology on logistics (e.g., how technology has improvedthe capability of businesses to track orders and control distribution).An example of technology's impact on logistics is the ability ofcompanies to track shipments and packages. Ten years ago, it couldrequire up to 20 days to receive and send a shipment, let alone trackits whereabouts. Using technology, companies can presently quicklyand easily track a package to within blocks of its location anddetermine the precise time of arrival at its destination. Additionaltrends the survey will examine include strategic alliances betweenmanufacturers and retailers that have enhanced the process ofinventory controls, and the new market opportunity for third-partylogistics services providers."We're looking forward to working with KPMG on this project,"Mentzer stated. "We think the alliance of our world-class logisticsexpertise and analysis capabilities with KPMG's real-world logisticsconsulting knowledge and technology implementation experience willresult in a sophisticated, thorough benchmarking tool.""We are very excited about working with the University ofTennessee on the survey," commented Steve Gold, partner, KPMG'snational logistics practice. "The University is nationally recognized asan innovative business school, and is renowned for its qualitylogistics program."When released in June, the survey results will be distributed to allparticipants and available internationally. The survey will continueto be viewed as a source and baseline for CIOs, CFOs and logistics,information, and financial managers.The University of Tennessee's logistics and transportation program,the oldest such program in the US, was ranked second in the nationby the Journal of Business Logistics.KPMG Peat Marwick LLP is the US practice of KPMG, which,worldwide, has over 6,000 partners, as well as 67,000 professionalsservicing clients through 1,100 offices in 837 cities located in 134countries.

(Norcross,GA, 404-447-4224) is designed for industrial environments wherebarcodes tend to be of less than perfect quality, and for use with thecompany's 6400, 6200, and 280 generation systems. When combinedwith LXE's interference-resistant frequency hopping spreadspectrum radios and terminals, the ruggedized fuzzy logic scannerdelivers a superior solution for outdoor industrial data collectionapplications, particularly in harsh environments.The LS3603 (which has a base price of $1,495) is claimed to be thefirst scanner with artificial intelligence for performing aggressive,"smart" scanning by assessing the print quality of the barcode andcompensating for imperfections. The device also enhances barcodeimages to improve working ranges on all symbols and offers optimalread rates on poorly printed barcodes, low -contrast and high-density bar codes, and dot matrix symbols.LXE's fuzzy scanner eludes connectivity problems with built-incommunications for RS-232 and wand emulation interfaces. Otherinterfaces are available with the use of a "smart cable" whicheliminates the need for a separate interface controller, rendering theLS3603 easier to install, maintain, and use. The scanner is built towork in very demanding environments, such as those with extremetemperatures (-22 degrees  to 122 degrees  F/-30 degrees  to 50degrees  C), and can withstand extreme humidity as well as repeatedsix-foot drops onto concrete. The LS3603 incorporates a patentedMylar scan element which resonates at a fixed frequency, therebycreating motion without wear and tear for guaranteed durability.Global revenues for barcode scanners are forecast to expand at a13.7% compound annual rate to approach $1.8 billion in 2000,compared to $730.6 million in 1993, according to Frost & Sullivan'sWorld Barcode Equipment Markets  report (5193-10). Revenues for1996-1999 are pegged at about $1.0 billion, $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion,and $1.6 billion, respectively.Worldwide unit shipments of barcode scanners are projected to riseat nearly a 15.6% compound annual rate to total about 6,600,000 in2000, as opposed to about 2,800,000 in 1993. Unit shipments for1996-1999 are placed at 3,900,000, 4,400,000, 5,000,000, and5,700,000, respectively.In 1996, the projected distribution of the total barcode scannnerrevenues by product type is: handheld laser scanners-31.1%; fixedposition laser scanners-49.4%; handheld CCD (charge coupled device)scanners-12.9%; and wand/lightpen scanners-6.6%. The distributionin 2000 will be: handheld laser scanners-31.8%; fixed position laserscanners-46.7%; handheld CCD scanners-16.0%; and wand/lightpenscanners-5.5%.In addition, as of last September, LXE had shipped more than 200 2.4GHz RF (radio frequency) terminals to ANC (Brussels, Belgium), one ofthe leading five express package delivery services in England. Amajor contract involving a 70-site installation was secured by LIS(London, England), an LXE international distributor organization (IDO)and one of the largest logistics systems integrators in Europe.ANC selected LXE's advanced frequency hopping spread spectrumsystem, which provides the backbone for wireless client/servercomputing with the former's existing system. The LXE 2320 Scout(TM) handheld computers (which have a base price of $1,900) areused to scan barcode tracking labels on individual packages as theyare handled at various points in the delivery process. Such a trackingsystem permits ANC to maintain "visibility" for each package fromthe time of pickup to the point of delivery.The 2320 DOS-based handheld data collection computer allows forboth warehouse and field automation operations in a single unit; andfeatures modular options which permit configuration for a widevariety of auto ID inputs, including barcode scanning, "touch"memory modules, RS-232 port, and/or infrared out for wirelessprinting. The device supports RF transaction processing and batchdata collection. Working in combination with LXE's 6410 OmniNetAccess Point, the 2300 Scout is able to connect directly to LANservers over the wireless link running DOS applications."One of the obvious benefits of the new scanning and dispatchsystem is that customer inquiries can be provided quickly andefficiently, also potential problems are virtually eliminated," notedAndrew Callaghan, ANC's managing director. "As service levelsbecome even more stringent, only the best will survive. ANC isdetermined to be the leading service provider in this region,therefore, we chose our suppliers very carefully. We feel that LXE's2.4 GHz RF system will give us the cutting edge over ourcompetition."Global revenues for barcode data terminals are predicted to increaseat a 13.6% compound annual rate to exceed $1.4 billion in 2000, from$584.3  million in 1993, according to Frost & Sullivan's WorldBarcode Equipment Markets  report. Revenues for 1996-1999 areprojected at $845.9 million,  $966.6 million, about $1.1 billion, andover $1.2 billion, respectively.Worldwide unit shipments of barcode data terminals are anticipatedto expand at nearly a 19.2% compound annual rate to total 1,730,900in 2000, compared to 507,500 in 1993. Unit shipments for 1996-1999 are placed at 927,300, about 1,142,600, 1,346,900, and1,522,000, respectively.In 1996, the projected product distribution of the total barcode dataterminals is: batch terminals-59.6%; and RF terminals-40.4%. Thedistribution in 2000 will be: batch terminals-53.6%; and RFterminals-46.4%.The value of US automatic ID system and software sales, includingexports, is forecast to expand at a 10.9% average annual rate toapproach $8.1 billion in 2000, compared to about $4.3 billion in1994, according to Business Communications Company, Inc.'sAutomatic Identification Systems  (K4G-12R). The data includesbarcode systems, magnetic stripe and smart cards, biometrics,machine vision, radio frequency, optical character recognition, andvoice recognition auto ID technologies. Domestic sales of barcodesystems are projected to grow at a 12% average annual rate toexceed $6 billion in 2000, from over $3 billion in 1994.In 1994, US sales of RF ID systems totaled $391 million, $156 millionof which was accounted for by the manufacturing industry.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANUFACTURING AUTOMATION via NewsNetJanuary, 1996RED PEPPER EXPLOITS A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITYThe ResponseAgent (TM) product family from Red Pepper SoftwareCompany (San Mateo, CA, 415-578-2640), an innovative developer ofreal-time supply chain optimization software based on intelligentagent technology, will be available with full support for MicrosoftWindows (R) 95 Clients, and Windows NT Servers in March of thisyear. Production pricing for ResponseAgent, which is also availablewith UNIX support, begins at $150,000.Red Pepper's support for Windows 95 and NT integrates the leadingdesktop user interface and environment with a highly advancedsupply chain optimization system that provides manufacturers withan "intelligent assistant" which generates optimized plans, constantlymonitors vital manufacturing variables, and proposes solutions tolarge-scale problems. Since most users are familiar with Windows,the ResponseAgent learning curve will be quite rapid.Users can, moreover, simply "drag" information from theResponseAgent and "drop" it into any desktop application--includingMicrosoft Office--for further analysis or presentation. Individuals canparticipate in planning sessions from remote sites, since theResponseAgent Windows 95 Client is designed to operate overordinary phone lines. The Windows 95 Client and Windows NTServer support offered by the ResponseAgent products leads to asignificant increase in user productivity, decreases the overall cost ofclient/server platforms, and accelerates ResponseAgent's return-on-investment."We believe this a very important technology development for RedPepper," stated Jim Shepherd, vice president at AdvancedManufacturing Research, Inc. (Boston, MA, 617-542-6600). "Theyhave correctly identified that manufacturers need the ability tosupport mixed networks of UNIX and NT, and that Windows 95 willrapidly emerge as the user interface standard. The improved userinterface and seamless integration with desktop applications likeMicrosoft Office should significantly enhance the productivity ofindividual ResponseAgent users and their ability to engage incollaborative planning.""Our ResponseAgents running Microsoft Windows 95 and WindowsNT offers a very wide range of benefits with unprecedented levels ofpower and flexibility," noted Monte Zweben, Red Pepper's president."The combination provides five key benefits that ad up to superiorperformance for our supply chain optimization customers. Theseinclude the ability to plan and schedule remotely via modem-basedportable computers, seamless integration with Microsoft Office andBackoffice applications and services, individually customizedResponseAgent user interfaces, and a choice of either or both UNIXand NT servers.""Red Pepper is the leading developer of intelligent agent-basedsupply chain optimization software, and Microsoft is very pleased tohave their family of products running on Windows 95 and WindowsNT," commented Doug Henrich, director, Microsoft DeveloperRelations Group. "Red Pepper's ResponseAgents are addressingenterprise-wide supply chain management challenges formanufacturers, and Microsoft's strategy is to provide the bestscalable operating systems from the desktop to the data center. Withour Microsoft Office and Backoffice product families, we are alsoproviding the enterprise-wide applications and servicesinfrastructure todays leading manufacturers require. Microsoft's andRed Pepper's products and strategies compliment one another toprovide quality solutions for manufacturing customers.""From an end-user perspective, it will be incredibly powerful toleverage all of our standard desktop productivity tools," noted ChrisBourne, production planning manager at 3Com Corporation. "We havea huge investment in personal computer hardware and software, andwe want to take advantage of the seamless integration of ourResponseAgent-based Worldwide Inventory Planning System (WIPS)with the rest of 3Com's mission-critical applications. The modem-based remote access capabilities of the new ResponseAgent alsoprovide another powerful capability for our users. With theResponseAgent Windows 95 Client, 3Com will further advance itsleadership and competitive advantage in manufacturing."Windows 95 provides the user interface for millions of personalcomputers operating worldwide. The ResponseAgent Windows 95Client enables users to enjoy the ease-of-use of PC-based applicationswith an extremely advanced type of supply chain optimizationsoftware. The advanced capabilities of Windows 95--such as pointand click, drag and drop, property inspectors, context-sensitivemenus, and on-line help--apply to the new ResponseAgent Client.Ongoing user productivity is further bolstered through the userinterface consistency and powerful functions of Windows 95.The overall system cost reduction enabled by Windows 95 extendsfrom platform acquisition through the life of the ResponseAgentsolutions. The initial system cost is reduced by employing standardPC hardware for the ResponseAgent; and the flexibility to select thebest servers for particular applications further diminishes costs. Theability to achieve more rapid system implementations results infaster payback and higher ROI for ResponseAgents.Since the ResponseAgent Client can fully interact with the Serverover ordinary phone lines, remote desktop and portable systems canfully participate in the planning process--whether at home or on theroad. The same access can be provided to key suppliers, field salespersonnel, or potentially customers requiring the latest informationabout product availability. The ResponseAgent Client furthermaximizes the power of Windows 95 by seamlessly integrating withstandard desktop applications, including Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint,Access, or Mail. Users can customize the ResponseAgent userinterface to meet their specific requirements. For example, the orderor format of ResponseAgent spreadsheets, or particular graphicalviews, can readily be modified without programming based on userpreferences.Founded in 1993, Red Pepper has leveraged its supply chainoptimization technology developed at NASA and coupled it with anew object-oriented system, architected to help manufacturers planand schedule their operations in an increasingly complex businessenvironment. The company's products have evolved from the GroundProcessing Scheduling System used to refurbish the Space Shuttlefollowing space missions into ResponseAgent software products thatcomplement existing transactional systems (MRPII, DRP, shop-floorcontrol) and enable real-time responsiveness to customer demands.Red Pepper's product offerings include Enterprise ResponseAgent(enterprise-wide planning and scheduling systems), ProductionResponseAgent (integrated planning and scheduling systems forproduction facilities), and Distribution ResponseAgent (integratedplanning and scheduling for distribution centers). ResponseAgentsare especially suited for manufacturers encountering significantunpredictability in customer demand, material availability, orcapacity optimization. Manufacturing processes benefiting from suchproducts include make-to-stock, assemble-to-order, make-to-order,and engineer-to-order.The value of global shipments of US-based vendors' microcomputer-based manufacturing planning and control software (excludingservices and hardware) is forecast to expand at about an 8.2% annualrate to approach $1.6 billion in 1999, from nearly $1.1 billion in1994, according to Plant-Wide Research Group's (North Billerica, MA,508-663-9212) annual Manufacturing Planning & Control SystemsReview and Forecast.

With theunprecedented growth in consumer markets for cellular phones and such productsas wireless speaker systems, the technology for wireless data communications isquickly maturing and coming down in price.For companies supplying wireless equipment, the manufacturing market "is goingto be a very big deal," says Jack Killion of Wireless Publishing Inc.Othersare just as bullish.  "There is going to be a massive boom, driven by thecellular phone market pushing down the costs of components and chips," saysWayne Manges of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Centers for ManufacturingTechnology.  "This is a key technology for the 21st Century.  People who getin early and stay with it will do extremely well."Numerous companies are installing wireless networks in their factories.  "Ourcustomer list has become endless," says John Davis, Director of IndustrialTechnology Marketing for Akron, Ohio-based Telxon, a publicly held company(NASDAQ symbol TLXN).  Telxon expects to grow its wireless manufacturing groupby almost 30 percent this year."Our growth is out of sight," says Davis. "It's very profitable." With theamount of growth that exists in the market "we're hiring people like crazy,"Davis adds. "If you have a skill and you know this industry, we will hire you."(Telxon supplies entire systems including handheld, pen-based, voice and visioncomputers and real time data collection devices. Its revenues increased 28percent from 1994 to 1995, from $271 million to $379 million.)Ford Motor's Louisville, Ky., plant, a four-million square foot facility, hasinstalled a wireless data communications system. Boeing, Chrysler, GM, GeneralElectric, Miller Brewing, Northrop, Allied Signal, Intel, consumer packagedgoods companies, retail stores like Wal-Mart and others such as Disney andAmerican Express are installing systems for use in material management,warehousing, quality control, monitoring and maintenance of machine tools andin-building paging."The leading edge companies in every industry are the ones who are doing this,"says Killion. "They're biting the bullet of higher costs because they recognizethe benefits are so good that they're just jumping on it."Wireless manufacturing plants offer the opportunity for companies to retrofitfacilities without extensive engineering hassles. "You can never get the cableright" in a manufacturing environment," says Manges of Oak Ridge. "There arepeople who spend their whole life keeping the cable in order." Wiring in anuclear power plant, for instance, typically costs about $2,000 per foot. Wireless systems also allow companies to put real-time information in the handsof empowered workers and they help in decision making. There are also benefitsassociated with the speed and reliability of data and the ability to spotproblems earlier with fewer people. Farther down the line, wireless can helpimprove customer service and lower inventories.Analysts project the market for wireless automated data collection at $3.4billion this year with a growth rate exceeding 20 percent per year.But there are still a lot of technical issues that need to be resolved beforewireless systems become ubiquitous in manufacturing operations. Integratinghundreds or thousands of data-generating sources into one seamless system is abig challenge. Redundancy has to be built in the system."Because of the size of the problems and the amount of data [that is beinggenerated], wireless requires multidisciplinary people," says Manges."Theoreticians, mathematicians, communications experts, computer junkies" areall needed to integrate sensors and data sources, all of which have their ownchannel. "If all you've done is replace wire you haven't solved the problem,"says Manges. "It's the non-architectural issues that are important: datastructuring, queuing theory, modeling. You have to start small and establishstandards as you build these systems." "Wireless is only now starting to be applied" in commercial enterprises, saysKillion. "It's a high priority for suppliers because there is so muchlow-hanging fruit" in virtually every industrial sector.Davis of Telxon can be reached at 216-873-2963; Killion can be reached at201-285-1500; Manges can be reached at 423-574-8529.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANUFACTURING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996LARGE MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS JOIN ENERGY DEPARTMENT'S AGILE MANUFACTURINGPROGRAMThe Department of Energy's Technologies Enabling Agile Manufacturing (TEAM)program, about a year old, is "beginning to put some flesh on the bones," saysprogram manager Diane Bird.TEAM is beginning to do "practical and important things," says ArisMelissaratos Vice President of Science, Technology and Quality at WestinghouseElectric Corp.  "They've taken the concepts of agility and are bringingtechnology to the shop floor...This is substantive work and brings agility tothe real world rather than it being theory and academics."TEAM's team now includes about 35 companies, many of which are householdnames, such as Cummins Engine, General Motors, AlliedSignal and numerousothers from a variety of industries.  Universities, R&D consortia and othergovernment agencies are engaged in the effort."We're not industry specific, nor are we terribly process specific," says Bird,who works in DOE's Defense Program's Office of Economic Competitiveness. "We'regoing to take the highest priority needs across a variety of industry sectorsand across a variety of processes that are in concert with our own [DOE] needsand work with that group."DOE has committed $5 million a year for three years to the TEAM effort.  Birdestimates that another $5 million in federal funding is finding its way intothe program through other government programs.  Industry is devoting about $10million a year in the effort, for a yearly total of about $20 million."Financially, things are getting tougher," says Bird.  "People are beginningto see the benefit of dividing up the workload and sharing the results."One of the primary themes of TEAM is the integration of various designsoftware tools with the equipment that makes parts and products.  Customers,suppliers and vendors in virtually every manufacturing sector have differentCAD tools, NC tools and NC programming software.  "One of the big complaintsis that not much of this talks to each other," Bird explains.  "It's not asimple task to make that happen and to make it happen without data loss orglitches."The Energy Department has been dealing with this problem for 15 years. Itsnuclear weapons production complex has purchased machine tool controllers andhas modified them for its own use. That labor intensive effort worked fine whenDOE had lots of money, but its budget is going down and the agency is becomingmore dependent on the private sector to pick up the slack. Moreover, manycommercial companies have the same problem of integrating different design andmanufacturing systems."In the past we've had to maintain our hardware and software ourself," saysBird. "But that's expensive and inefficient and we'd like to go buy this stuffoff the shelf." By involving industry in helping suppliers produce openarchitecture equipment and software, the entire supply base will be far morerobust. "A larger group of users in the commercial environment will help findglitches, improve it, and drive additional revisions and upgrades much morequickly than we could with our low production volume," says Bird.There is no doubt that this would happen without the Energy Department's help.But DOE is restricted to "Buy American" procurement provisions. Unfortunately,many overseas suppliers have no desire to sell equipment that would be used tomanufacture nuclear bombs.Overseas suppliers also tend to implement their latest generation systems ontheir home turf. "It's much more difficult to have those relationships withforeign countries and assure that you are indeed getting the neweststate-of-the-art equipment," says Bird.The new tools would be developed without DOE assistance, but if U.S. industrymisses the market window, then U.S. companies may not be involved both insupplying the manufacturing systems and utilizing them. And thus DOE's push."Sure it will happen anyway," says Bird. "But will it happen by developments byU.S. companies and entities or will it happen overseas and then we will just bepurchasing all of this?"Bird can be reached at 202-586-0499.

When NAM president Jerry Jasinowski startedplanning the campaign, few positive statements were being made aboutmanufacturing.  Layoffs, pollution and knuckle-headed management stories ruledthe day.  Manufacturers were on the defense.But there are plenty of success stories that have since been written and theManufacturing Institute is doing its best to target members of Congress and themedia to pick up on them.The campaign last year involved hundreds of people at the national, state andlocal level. NAM sponsored 40 events in 25 states. It commissioned artwork andposters by Peter Max. It wrote a manufacturing coffee table book. It promotedmanufacturing through a national media campaign. And it created a popularmanufacturing educational program for the nation's high schools that is nowbeing incorporated in a CD-ROM format.The entire campaign consumed some $3 million and was funded by the nation'slargest manufacturing companies.  Intel, for instance, is underwriting an$80,000 essay contest for high-school students.  The theme is the future ofmanufacturing in America and the contest has drawn more than 2,300 entries.Only about 750 were expected.NAM expects the manufacturing campaign to consume between $1 million and $1.5million this year. "I don't see us letting up on a publicity campaign," saysBiro, who joined NAM from American Airlines in 1992. "There is always going tobe a job to do." Much of the funding this year will come from grants.The campaign has done a great deal to improve NAM's image as well. NAM isextremely healthy, says Biro. Revenues have increased by 6 to 7 percent a yearfor the past four years. "We're not trying to grow staff, but last year was arecord for membership growth," says the 34-year-old Biro. NAM now has 13,600member companies.A lot of that growth has to do with the improved fortunes of manufacturers andthe high profile of NAM president Jerry Jasinowski. But a great deal of it canbe attributed to  Biro and his staff's attention to improving services tomembers and marketing NAM in a more aggressive manner. Others in the tradeassociation field are envious of the job NAM has done in this regard, and it isoften held up as a benchmark for how to improve member services and increasemembership.Central to the marketing operation is a telemarketing sales force of 20, whichwill be increased by three this year. Paid on a commission basis, these folkscall prospective members and those who are renewing their memberships. Birobelieves he can add 1,000 new members this year and he has a personal goal of25,000 members. The average member pays around $500 a year in dues, but therange is from $150 to $130,000 per year."Our image has changed," he says. NAM is no longer thought of as being a stodgyplace. The organization has improved its communications to members and hasstarted promoting its own accomplishments rather than taking a more modestapproach to its successes in Washington.

While new approaches to improving operationsand reducing costs will be important, "manufacturers that want staying powerwill continue to use...new alliances to compete," says Hronec.Companies will need to team up with customers, suppliers and competitors andthe most successful firms will access customer and supplier informationthrough electronic data interchange and the Internet.  The most successfulglobal companies will move beyond the "country-to-country" management approachand will use communications technologies to choose from global vendors andsuppliers, rather than being limited to local, regional or national resources.Manufacturing Execution Systems and Enterprise Requirements Planning willcontinue to gain in popularity during the year.  Companies that involveemployees in their strategic planning processes will succeed above and beyondtheir rivals, says Hronec.Savvy manufacturers will use "activity-based cost management" which will allowthem to restructure their operations to concentrate their resources on theprocesses that are the most profitable and cost effective.  "We seemanufacturers either combining operations or splitting them up to enhancetheir competitive advantage," says Hronec.  "Either way the result issomething different from what they were before."Finally, the ISO9000 quality and ISO14000 environmental standards will continueto be important. ISO14000 will "soon become a basic and necessary part of doingbusiness around the world," says Hronec, who can be reached at 213-614-8512.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANUFACTURING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996LIMBERING UP IS A BEST PRACTICE AT SPRING FACTORY RUN BY DAYTON PARTS INC.To manufacture springs, you have to be flexible. That's the lesson learned byDayton Parts Inc., of Harrisburg, Pa., a $57 million manufacturer of 17,000different types of springs primarily used in trucks.The company had a problem of excessive worker injuries which it discoveredoccurred almost entirely during the first two hours of each shift.  In 1990,the company experimented with a stretching program for all of its plantpersonnel and a core group continued with the program for one year.  "At theend of the year, none of the employees in the stretching group had beeninjured," says a U.S.  Navy Best Manufacturing Practices survey of the companyconducted this past summer.  "This result influenced DPI to make stretchingexercises mandatory again in 1992.  All employees are now required to stretchfor 10 to 15 minutes before starting production.  This time is included withinthe normal workshift."The stretching program costs about $75,000 per year to operate, but it pays ahandsome dividend. In conjunction with other safety programs, the company'sannual cost of workman's compensation has decreased from $700,000 to $200,000.The savings were refunded to the company and the money was used in part to payemployee bonuses.Dayton Parts sounds like most companies that have become enlightened over thepast decade.  Its management philosophy is based Eliah Goldratt's theory ofconstraints as outlined in his book, The Goal, which is required reading inall plant departments.  "Every action is focused on the common goal of makingmoney now and in the future," says the BMP survey.  "This program...haseffected a real cultural change throughout the company."Safety, customer service, quality and cost reduction are driving forces in thecompany. "Shop-floor supervisors now function more as coaches in the continuousimprovement process as the workcells are becoming sell-managed," says the BMPsurvey. "Employees are actively involved in continuous improvement teams andtheir input is making a difference."For a copy of the 12-page report, contact Ernie Renner, Director of the BMPprogram at 1-800-789-4267, or fax a request to him at 301-403-8180 (e-mail:ernie@bmpcoe.org).Back to Headline List CopyrightMANUFACTURING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996A NEW BUSINESS MODEL FOR DOD BEGINS TO GAITHER MOMENTUM: ADVANCED CONCEPTTECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONSThe Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration  (ACTD) program at the Pentagonhas evolved in just two years into becoming a substantial effort that willleverage three-quarters of a billion dollars. And if the Pentagon brass has itsway, it should grow substantially in the future. For fiscal year 1997, the ACTD office working with the services had drawn up alist of 100 potential ACTDs-"fieldable prototypes"-before winnowing that downto 46.  The office expects to start another dozen or so new projects nextyear, although the number of new starts "is not the characteristic by which weought to be measured," says Jack Bachkosky, Deputy Under Secretary of Defensefor Advanced Technology.  The program also has been pared back by Congress.The Pentagon asked for $65 million this year, but received an appropriation of$39 million.The program aims to quickly prove the viability of new military systems withintight budgetary constraints.  The systems are tailored to the needs of the enduser-the warfighters-and include close participation by technologists,industry and program managers.  "We're marriage brokers," says Bachkosky inexplaining his role in fostering the deployment of commercial off-the-shelfand mature technologies into useful new defense systems.The eight ACTDs now under way and the nine new projects that will start in1996 represent a new way of doing business for the Pentagon.  With technologychanging faster than the defense procurement system, military planners arefielding systems that are obsolete before they go into production.The ACTDs only embrace mature technologies that can be fielded almostimmediately in new systems, "We make sure the users understand they know whatthe technology will and will not do," Bachkosky told a group of reporters in arecent Pentagon briefing.  Some technologies may not be mature enough to carryout a far-fledged mission.  Others that use commercial components not designedfor the military may not work without radical reengineering at substantialcost.  Such technologies are probably not good candidates for ACTDs, saysBachkosky."ACTD provides the procedures for the users to identify his needs initially,then there is a continuous interaction" so the user understands how much such asystem will cost and whether it's feasible for it to go into production throughthe normal acquisition process, he explains. Understanding the cost of production and ownership-maintenance and manpowerneeded to operate the system-is part of the ACTD process. "If it does provide aneeded capability and its costs are not insurmountable, then it will go intolow-rate production," says Bachkosky.The "Predator" autonomous aerial vehicle, which is now flying above Bosnia, isan example of a more mature ACTD.  It has a range of 500 miles; can fly at25,000 feet for 40 hours and can cruise at 70 miles per hour.  It is equippedwith a payload of sensors.  Commanders on the ground would love to have asystem that flies at mach one or mach 1.6.  But to field such a system, theACTD program would have to begin an entirely new project.  If the fieldcommanders "want to buy a 911 Porsche for a Honda Civic price" then the ACTDoffice has to tell them "we can't afford it," says Bachkosky.  "We give theman estimate on how much more it will cost.  The warfighter can accept that ornot."The ACTD program "is a way of working around the acquisition process,"Bachkosky adds.  "It provides an entry for systems the military wants andneeds."  The office is working closely with industry and industry associationsto create projects based on purely commercial technologies.  Even a companylike Disney has something to offer in the way of simulation technology."They're not immune from taking money from DOD as they are from anywhereelse," says Bachkosky, who can be reached at 703-697-6446.APPROVED 1996 ACTDS:o Combat IDo Logistics (Total Asset Visibility)o Medium Lift Helicopter (completed)o Semi-Automated Imagery Processingo Battlefield Awareness and Data Disseminationo Counter Proliferationo Military Operations in Built Up Areas (delayed 1 year)o Ship Defense Against Imaging IR Missiles (cancelled)o Navigation Warfareo Miniature Air Launched Decoyo Land Vehicle Survivabilityo Biological Defense NetFUNDING FOR ACTDS INITIATED IN 1995:o Joint Countermine, $133.6 milliono Rapid Force Projection Initiative, $89.2 milliono Precision Signals Intelligence Targeting, $10.5 milliono Advanced Joint Planning, $63.4 milliono Synthetic Theater of War, $104 milliono Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, $197 milliono Counter Multiple Rocket Launcher, $37 milliono Cruise Missile Defense, $37 millionTotal Service/Agency Funding: $641 millionTotal OSD Integrating ACTD Funding: $30 millionTotal ACTD Funding: $671 millionACTDS: MOTIVATION FOR CHANGE:o The revolution in information technology-18 month technology turnovero An acquisition system optimized for major weapon system procuremento Diversity and uncertainty of future military operationso "The rate of acquisition process change must mirror the rate of technologicalchange to be relevant."ACTDS: SELECTION CRITERIA:1.

"Eleven auto manufacturers now compete inJapan intensely for a market that is less than half the size of the U.S.," hesays. "This is hardly a sanctuary."The Big Three's problems in Japan are being caused "precisely" for the reasonthat Japan's market "is not a sanctuary that allows manufacturers to ignorecustomers needs for easy profits."  In August of last year, imports took 13percent of Japan's automobile market and 32 percent of the large car segmentwas captured by Ford, GM and Chrysler."Detroit's automakers have only recently indicated a serious interest inselling cars in Japan and still have a long way to go to match their Europeancounterparts in product availability, market fit and investment," says Duncan,who can be reached at 202-296-8537.Back to Headline List CopyrightMANUFACTURING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996CORPORATE NEWS: KOLLMORGAN CORP.; SELECTRON CORPKollmorgan Corp.  has won the The National Electrical ManufacturersAssociation's Automation Forum's Renewal Award for improving its manufacturingfacilities and keeping them in the United States.

For the most part, these are referred to as depots,although there are other manufacturing assets, such as shipyards andindustrial departments.  Over the years, these facilities have been used tomaintain the fleet and have benefited from protective legislation guaranteeingsources of work.  But as the Defense Department continues to downsize, thesein-house assets are being viewed for reduction or closure.The current policy of the government is to depend on the private sector to themaximum extent possible.  This policy has been established in OMB CircularA-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities," and has recently beenreemphasized in the "Roles and Mission" report presented to the Secretary ofDefense.  Under certain conditions, however, the private sector is not used.These would include areas protected by the government to maintain capabilityas governed by the "60/40" rule which keeps 60 percent of all maintenance workin-house, and areas where the private sector has defaulted on performancerequirements, can't respond to fleet emergencies, or chooses not to bid ongovernment solicitations.There are presently two versions of legislation pending in Congress to addressthe "60/40" rule.  Both bills appear to eliminate this "60/40" restriction,forcing the services to outsource work previously performed in-house.  Takingthe potential legislative decision to the extreme, depots would be closed forbusiness and private industry would become responsible for all defenseindustrial work.  This would include those categories of work that privateindustry failed to do correctly the first time.Obviously, out-sourcing all defense work is not the sole solution todownsizing.  The government will need to maintain some in-house manufacturingcapability to respond to fleet needs when private industry cannot do so.  Theresult will be a compromise to the "60/40" rule, where the governmentmaintains a much smaller in-house capability.  A challenge for the DefenseDepartment, therefore, is deciding how to address this impending legislationin a timely and efficient manner.In Lakehurst, N.J., the Navy has a $200 million manufacturing facility, whichoccupies 250,000 square feet of unique buildings and is staffed by 214manufacturing engineers and artisans.  The primary purpose of the Lakehurstplant is to provide prototype manufacturing support, producibility analysis,drawing package validation and the application of new manufacturingtechnologies to the design, development, and product verification of flightcritical aircraft launch and recovery and support equipment.  A significantpart of the Lakehurst work involves completing contractor defaulted efforts,responding to fleet-critical needs and conducting work the private sector wasnot interested in doing.Supported by the National Performance Review recommendations, a downsizing andthe creation of a competency-aligned organization, Lakehurst has been reducedto its core, with employment down approximately 33 percent from four yearsago.  The key to the continued success of this downsized organization wasidentifying the critical in-house labor required to perform the tasksnecessary to deliver quality equipment and support contracting efforts.  Tasksthat could be performed by industry were earmarked for contracting out.  Thenet result is an industrial facility that is working with non-defenseorganizations and is operating at the same level of performance at a reducedcost.According to Richard Rumpf, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Research,Engineering and Systems, partnering permits the government to maximize use ofprivate industry, reduce the possibility of default, keep the fleet runningsmoothly and allow the government to reduce its size while maintainingcapability.      The partnering concept is also fully compliant with Federal AcquisitionRegulations and public law. Concepts for partnering are being refined andexplored at Navy Lakehurst and, if successful, offer the possibility forapplying the partnership concept to depots when and if the "60/40" rule isabolished in the December, 1997, timeframe. Partnerships are a win-winarrangement for both the Navy and industry.-Gindele is with the Naval Air Warfare Center's Aircraft Division at Lakehurst,N.J.

Politicians spent the year breaking whatwas already broken. As U.S. industry stormed into 1996, the U.S. governmentlimped. While the private sector was undergoing a rebirth with a surge of confidenceprovided by the maturation of new technologies and the booming stock market,the U.S.  government reached a nadir, getting bombed in Oklahoma and closingits doors in Washington.  If it's any consolation to those who work for UncleSam, it wasn't long ago that U.S.  industry was in about the same situationwith few predicting the turnaround that has ensued.1995 will be remembered as the year the Internet sprang into the consciousnessof the nation. It was a year in which the electronic revolution intensified.Manufacturing found a seat at the corporate table, having been orphaned fordecades. The quality revolution seeped further into the business culture. Andthe government was on the verge of a radical restructuring.For the vast majority of people in the U.S.  who are involved in the newindustries that have been created over the past 20 years and the olderindustries that have been transformed by the new technologies, a new age ofhope has definitely appeared, driven by the knowledge that humans areresourceful, extremely hard working, are capable of changing quickly andlearning new skills.  This abundance of energy is collectively transformingthe way we live.  All of this is good news.Here are some of the more profound, enlightened and interesting things peoplesaid in 1995, as captured by the editorial staff of Manufacturing News.ON INDUSTRY"There is a disproportionate amount of pessimism in America about our abilityto compete globally.  Remember, 10 years ago people were saying that wecouldn't compete at all and we were living in a post-industrial society andmanufacturing was written off.  The big story is that that is not happening.I don't think the majority of Americans know about this story."--Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, May15, 1995Over the next 50 years, companies will generate hundreds of billions ofdollars-and maybe even trillions of dollars-a year in revenue. Management willutilize concepts common in organisms and start applying them to corporatestructures. "We will take anecdotes out of nature and convert them intopractical, living guidelines. We will find better ways of letting thingsorganize from the bottom instead of from the top."--Bob Galvin, Chairman of the Executive Committee, Motorola, Nov. 15, 1995"I don't want guys on the [manufacturing] line supporting me.  I want tosupport the guys who are doing the work.  I'm just overhead."--Koichi Nishimura, President and CEO of Solectron Corp., Jan. 3, 1995"Will Rogers once said, 'Even if you are on the right track, you'll get runover if you just sit there.' And he was right.  None of us can afford tobecome complacent."--William Mitchell, Vice Chairman, Texas Instruments, March  31, 1995."Leadership is all about causing change. Management is about maintaining acertain level of performance or implementing a program. You have to have bothskills, but the one that we have least of at this point is leadership."--Eric Houts, Continuous Improvement Program Manager, Kaiser Electronics, Feb.1, 1995The Asian competitive threat, particularly from South Korea, "is coming muchfaster than most people think and the implications for business, government,our customers and employees-our overall competitiveness and our standard ofliving-are enormous."  The U.S.  government and industry must undergo a "majorchange, [otherwise] the role of the Western World will gradually diminish."--Alex Trotman, Chairman and CEO, Ford Motor Co., Sept. 15, 1995"I will be a very content business executive when we sell our $250 million[defense] business and I don't have to deal with the Defense Department of theUnited States or [defense departments] anywhere else in the world.

I say to the workers,'Tell me about this company?' And if they say 'They' [when talking aboutmanagement], I know it is [a struggling] company.  If they say 'We,' I knowit's a different kind of company."--Labor Secretary Robert Reich, April 17, 1995."I have been through the entire transition of the military being the primarydriver of new semiconductor technologies to the military being such a smallpart of it that it doesn't drive anything, virtually,"--Don Walker, Vice President of Motorola and Director of the company'sCommercial-Plus Technologies Operation formerly the Military ProductsOperation, based in Tempe, Ariz, speaking about the company's decision toclose its military semiconductor business, May 15, 1995"In our world-class plants the only person not on a shift is a plant managerand he is required to come down once a month and run the line."--James Schoonover, Director of Operations for DuPont, July 3, 1995"This year, the government of Switzerland is procuring more fighter aircraftthan the United States.

In our opinion, this is anopportune time for investors to capitalize on this industry."--William Cage, J.C. Bradford & Co., September 1, 1995"Quantitative analysis of the culture of top growth companies reveals that theyconsistently place higher value in areas such as teamwork, innovation, customerorientation, flexibility, accountability and organizational learning.Interestingly, top growth companies place low value on bureaucracy, politicalpower and an orientation toward profit."--Douglas Tuttle, Deloitte & Touche, July 1, 1995"At least three-quarters of America's gain in export competitiveness can belinked to [the high yen].  It is important to recognize that part of theapparent transformation in the competitive picture is the result of factorsthat don't have much to do with the fundamentals of productive performance."--Richard Lester, director of the MIT Industrial Performance Center, October17, 1995"Plants that export are quite different from firms and plants that do not...Inalmost all dimensions, the exporters' performance is preferable."--Why Exports Really Matter, a report from the Manufacturing Institute, July17, 1995"The use of advanced manufacturing technologies confers benefits upon bothfirms and employees.  Employees in technology-using firms are the recipientsof higher wages and stronger wage gains."--John Baldwin, Statistics Canada, July 3, 1995"The only sustainable competitive advantage you can achieve in the chemicalindustry is through new technology, not cost, not service. Technology. And thedevelopment of this new technology is essential just to stay even with thecompetition." --Jim Trainham, Director of Engineering R&D at DuPont's Central R&D facility,Oct. 2, 1995"We're at a critical point-a crisis point-in that the printed board technologyand the assembly technology hasn't kept pace.

Why? BecauseIntel, HP and TI have shorted the timeframe of the life of their chips by 50percent. When they do that, the creative side dominates, whereas on theimprovement side, when the Japanese start to improve the Intel 486, the Pentiumis released. By the time they start to improve the Pentium, the next one iscoming out. The Japanese are really hurt by this strategy."--John Preston, Director of Technology Development, MIT, Feb. 15, 1995"At Nissan, industrial engineers will take video tapes of people doing a pieceof work and then the industrial engineer will go fast forward, repeat, fastforward, repeat and time it and analyze the motion of the wrists and fingersdown to a level where they are then able to detail out how to do this processthe most efficient way and train their people that way.

The nation couldn't wait much longer for manufacturing toundergo an image change both in the public and corporate worlds.But now the manufacturing community has to build on the good news of 1995.Education has replaced competitiveness as the buzzword of the 1990s. As well itshould.During Christmas break, I drove my family from Washington, D.C., to Toronto, a10-hour trip. About halfway between the two cities lies Corning, N.Y., near thePennsylvania border. On the way back from Toronto, we stopped at the CorningGlass Museum.The museum includes a tour of the Steuben glass factory, which my childrenfound to be "awesome, cool," they say.  They had no idea of how glass wasmade, and could not believe their eyes when a craftsman making a $400paperweight easily cut the hot glass with a pair of shears.The factory was spotless and modern. The workers obviously enjoyed what theywere doing. And the products they made were works are art-expensive, but worthit-given the amount of work and skill needed to make them, say my kids, whoenthusiastically said they'd love to learn the craft.Having never thought of it before, they realized how important glass is in ourculture and that it's been made for more than 3,000 years. They experienced theentire  process, from the gathering of the raw materials to the grinding,polishing and inspection of the final product.  "I loved it," said my12-year-old daughter.If you are the owner or manager of a manufacturing plant, show it off to thechildren in your community AND their parents AND the press. Manufacturing is reclaiming its place in American society, but it needs a push.Making products is sexy, vibrant, high-tech, exciting and rewarding.

The silicon pressure sensor represents the firstcommercially successful application of micromachining.Since sensors are often the vital components determining thefeasibility of new products, they have a significant leverage factor,enabling production of sensor-based systems exceeding sensor costby several orders of magnitude; e.g., a $10 MAP (manifold absolutepressure) sensor facilitates production of fuel efficient, low polluting,$25,000 cars. Originally an expensive and exotic technology, silicon-based pressure transducers were initially employed exclusively inspecialized aerospace, testing, and instrumentation functions, Bryzekexplains. However, within the past decade, advances in siliconmicromachining manufacturing technology have created a plethora ofnew uses for such technology.Silicon is widely used in manufacturing purely electronic integratedcircuits, where only the material's electrical properties are exploited.Micromechanics utilizes the electrical and mechanical properties ofsilicon to create a new generation of electromechanical silicon chips.Silicon micromachining technology is attractive, owing to itsmechanical properties and to the support available from the ICindustry. Mechanically, silicon is almost a perfect material forpressure sensors, since it is stronger than steel, as light as aluminum,not subject to mechanical hysteresis, highly sensitive to stress, andcan be readily batch micromachined. Support available from themainstream electronic industry includes proven semiconductormanufacturing processes, ultra-pure, low-cost materials, advancedmanufacturing equipment, high-volume manufacturing andpackaging technologies, and educated technologists.The significance of the leverage that silicon sensor technology enjoysis particularly clear when comparing the total R&D expenditures inthe sensor and IC industries. The global sensor budget, covering adiverse range of technologies, is on the order of $200 millionannually, according to Bryzek. Funding for new developments by theIC industry and supporting services totals on the order of billions ofdollars per year. Adopting mainstream electronic industrydevelopments significantly reduces the development time and costfor micromechanical devices; and new micromachining or sensor-specific technologies can be developed from the rich foundationcreated for electronic ICs.The roots of silicon micromachining technology hark back to BellLaboratories. The research team developing the basics ofsemiconductor technology discovered a piezoresistive effect in siliconand germanium. The first research paper, published in 1954,characterized the basic piezoresistive properties of such materials.The piezoresistive effect creates a resistance change in thesemiconductor material in response to stress, which is about twoorders of magnitude larger than the equivalent resistance change ofmetals used for non-silicon strain gage applications.California's Silicon Valley played a vital role in bringing MEMSdevices to the marketplace. Characteristic of many semiconductorcompanies, the initial silicon sensor start-ups spun-off from Fairchildin the 1970s: ICT Transducers (now Foxboro/ICT, San Jose, CA);National Semiconductor's Sensor Group (now SenSym, Milpitas, CA);Endevco R&D (Sunnyvale, CA); and Cognition (now Rosemount, whoseMeasurement Division is headquartered in Eden Prairie, MN).Bryzek has helped pioneer and generate the market momentum andinfrastructure for silicon micromachined sensors, having been a co-founder of such companies as NovaSensor, which was acquired byBritish-based Lucas Industries, plc circa1990. Lucas NovaSensor(R)(Fremont, CA) is under the rubric of Lucas Control Systems Products(Hampton, VA), a part of Lucas Industries, plc.During the past ten years, the Silicon Valley MEMS market hasemerged to form a mini industry. According to Bryzek, about 900people are currently employed in the MEMS industry in the Valley,which is comprised of eight active microsensor companies, 13companies/organizations involved in microstructures, and threeuniversity R&D centers. The average sales per employee for the topthree microsensor companies in Silicon Valley amounts to about$133,000.The total MEMS sensor/non-sensing market is forecast by Bryzek togrow at a 16.5% compound annual rate to reach $6.7 billion in 2005,compared to about $1.45 billion in 1995. The non-sensing MEMSmarket (encompassing fluid controls, data storage, displays, biochips,communication, and miscellaneous devices) is anticipated to advanceat 52.5% compound annual rate to total $3.4 billion in 2005, fromabout $50 million in 1995.The MEMS pressure sensor market is projected to expand at a 9.6%compound annual rate, from $1.0 billion in 1995 to $2.5 billion in2005. Shipments of silicon pressure sensors, according to Bryzek,rose from about 3 million units in 1983 to over 40 million units in1995, and are forecast to exceed 125 million units/year in the nextdecade. The total market for MEMS inertial sensors is expected toincrease at nearly a 7.2% compound annual rate to reach $800million in 2005, from $400 million in 1995. During the past threeyears, the silicon acceleration sensor market mushroomed to 15million units per year. Several additional MEMS inertial sensorapplications are in the initial commercialization phase, promising theformation of billion dollar market opportunities.Bryzek expects sanguine expansion in MEMS sensor markets, as wellas non-sensing MEMS applications. MEMS pressure sensors willexperience significant growth, primarily fueled by automotiveapplications and smart sensors with networked output. Emergingautomotive applications for MEMS pressure sensors include fuelvapor sensors, high-pressure fuel injection systems, diesel MAP(manifold absolute pressure) sensors, and "braking by wire"(electronic braking) in passenger cars and trucks. The volume ofinertial (acceleration, rate, gyro) sensors will rapidly expand, mainlyin the automotive and virtual reality sectors, accompanied bysubstantial price erosion.The next generation of fluidic components (such as pressure valves)is expected by Bryzek to enjoy considerable growth. The currentgeneration of fluid controls is not yet capable of sufficiently meetinguser requirements, since they have drawbacks in terms of lack ofmedia compatibility, limited temperature range, and restrictedpressure range.Active development of MEMS-based data storage technology isunderway; and Bryzek perceives the most commercially promisingdevelopment to be the hard drive head suspension (gimble) with anon-chip servomotor, driven by an industry consortium initiated byProfessor D. Miu of UCLA.The servomotor enables .1 um positioning accuracy of the head,corresponding to about 100 GB/sq. in. read-write density, and fitsinto the "sockets" of the existing mechanical devices to provide 10um resolution. Since current industry volume is on the order of onemillion heads per day, with an estimated volume price of about $5for the gimble/head assembly, this application represents a potentialmarket of $1.3 billion. Moreover, several other storage chiptechnologies hold promise for achieving volume production duringthe next decade.Activity in the area of MEMS display chips is being spearheaded byTexas Instruments' (Dallas, TX) micromirror display development.Two Silicon Valley start-ups are focusing on MEMS displaytechnology (electrostatically activated microbeams reflecting light),including Echelle (Mountain View, CA). MEMS displays have potentialto capture a significant share of the large display industry.MEMS biochips can allow a new generation of products to appear inthe marketplace, including DNA multipliers, chemical reactors, andbacteria processors. Bryzek expects the MEMS biochip market togrow briskly over the next ten years, adding that about one billionbiochips annually could potentially be used in DNA multipliers.Concerning MEMS communication devices/components, fiber-opticaligners have been on the market for a number of years. Bryzekobserves that the recent development of fiber-optic MEMS switcheshas potential for enabling the implementation of on-demandresidential multimedia applications.In November 1995, Dr. Bryzek left Lucas NovaSensor to start-upIMST, which aims to become the global leader in smart integratedand networkable sensors in less than five years. The company, whichis in the process of formation, plans to initially develop a newgeneration of OEM pressure transducers featuring advances infunctionality, price/performance, quality, and reliability, whileretaining socket compatibility with many competitive "dumb"devices. The products will incorporate a unique on-sensor-chippressure media protection capability to eliminate the need for metaldiaphragms. They will also offer a high level of electronicsintegration, including electronic trimming for compensation andcalibration, wireless communication, and control networking.Dr. Bryzek has initiated discussions with selected companiesinterested in creating strategic partnerships with his new venture.He plans to initially introduce products that meet the requirementsof such partners, and then unveil standard product lines. Dr. Bryzekwelcomes inquiries from companies interested in establishing abusiness relationship with IMST.Sincerely,Peter Adrian, EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightSENSOR BUSINESS DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary, 1996AMMI EXPLOITS GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR SILICONMICROMACHINED SENSORSAdvanced MicroMachines Incorporated (AMMi, Cleveland, OH, 216-229-4636) has doubled its sales staff over the past few months tocapitalize on promising business opportunities in the siliconmicromachined sensors arena.One opportunity entails the design and development of amicromechanical extreme temperature sensing bimetallic switch thatdoes not require power. The device is based on the same principlesthat apply in the macro world--two adjacent materials with differentcoefficients of thermal expansion will experience a bending momentalong their lengths, as one material expands more than the other.Although this concept is well over 100 years old, new challengesmust be surmounted when dealing with structures that are about thesize of a human eyelash, such as residual stresses formed in thestructures due to wafer processing.However, micromachined bimetallic temperature sensors offer thekey benefits of enhanced sensitivity, due to both their largerdeflections and increased radii of curvature. Such advantages can beleveraged to cost-effectively produce micromachined bimetallicswitches that latch into place when an extreme hot or coldtemperature is achieved, which enables the device to be effectivelyapplied for diagnostic monitoring. For example, such sensors aresufficiently small to be embedded in a truck tire. When it is time toretread the tire, a quick check can be performed to determinepossible damage to the polymer rubber caused by overheating.Additional potential applications include relays, temperatureswitches, and thermostats.Another business opportunity identified by AMMi calls for designingand developing a miniature array of high frequency response heatflux sensors to be used inside a gas turbine engine. The product isunique, since an array of sensors is embedded in a flexible material,allowing for mounting many sensors onto the curved surface of aturbine blade in a timely and effective manner. While thecommercial applications for such a product in aircraft engine testingare limited due to high temperature constraints, many other marketopportunities are opened when other types of sensors are consideredas candidates for being embedded as arrays in flexible materials,notes Louis Toly, AMMi's business manager.AMMi's mission within the competitive sensor market is to be thepreferred source for the design, development, prototyping,integration, testing, and packaging of microsensors andmicroactuators for industrial and medical applications. The companyhas expertise in all aspects of sensor design, including both thesensor component and the associated ASICs for signal processing.Such components are integrated in a hybrid configuration andpackaged for protection from harsh environments. The company,therefore, can provide its clients with sensors possessing smartcapabilities.AMMi began as a provider of consulting services in the area of MEMSabout two years ago, and still plans to continue in this arena. Largecorporations are often reluctant to invest manpower and equipmentin MEMS, due to the significant inherent financial risks involved inmaking a new technology commercially available. AMMi helpsmitigate such risks by assisting new entrants in the siliconmicromachined sensors arena, which is fraught with growthopportunities.Demand for MEMS-based temperature sensors for tires is projectedto total $250 million (representing 25,000,000 units) in 2000,according to System Planning Corporation's (Arlington, VA, 703-351-8677) Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)  market study. Theglobal market for MEMS temperature sensors in automobiles isforecast to reach $400 million (representing 40,000,000 units) in2000. The report notes that sensors that demand for MEMStemperature sensors is expanding in the automobile, truck, and tireindustries, and that such sensors will continue to find newapplications in such devices as fire alarms, HVAC systems, andportable electronics.The value of the Western European market for silicon temperaturesensors is projected to rise at a 10.6% average annual rate to total$19.5 million in 1997, from $10.7 million in 1992, according to Frost& Sullivan's report on The European Market For Silicon Sensors(#RE1760/J). The market for silicon temperature sensors in WesternEurope is pegged at $15.9 million in 1995. In 1997, the end-userindustry distribution of the Western silicon temperature sensormarket will be: while goods (e.g., washing machines, dishwashers,ovens, coffee makers)-35%; automotive-32%; HVAC (includingindustrial/domestic thermostats)-10%; electronics/instrumentation(temperature compensation and control)-15%; and "other" (includingshavers)-8%.SBD  forecasts that global revenues for silicon/IC temperaturesensors will expand at a 6% compound annual rate to reach $40.2million in 2000, compared to about $30 million in 1995.Back to Headline List CopyrightSENSOR BUSINESS DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary, 1996FIBER-OPTIC SENSOR MAY SPARK DIESEL ENGINE COMBUSTIONPRESSURE MONITORINGThe new diesel combustion pressure sensor (Model OPS350-3000)available from Optrand, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI, 313-769-4094) isdesigned for continuous, long-term operation under dieselcombustion conditions. The reliable, low-cost sensor-- which isespecially suitable for engine health monitoring or control instationary and movable diesel engines--is capable of withstandinghigh overpressures and combustion detonations without sufferingdamage or performance degradation.Using Optrand's fiber-optic sensing technology developed for adverseenvironmental applications, the OPS350-3000 operates at sensorhousing temperatures up to 350 degrees C, and has a guaranteed lifeof 200 million cycles, which is purportedly not currently availablefrom other competing commercial products. Optrand's dieselcombustion pressure sensor is available in a sealed gage pressurepackage, and is offered in two versions with accuracies of 1% and 3%.In conjunction with Optrand OPT1000 series opto-electronicinterfaces, the sensor system provides a frequency response of 0.1Hz to 15 kHz, covering engine knock frequencies. The sensor isavailable in four miniature housing styles ranging in size from M5(5mm diameter thread) to 3/8"-24 in diameter. Specifically intendedfor high-volume and OEM applications, the OPS350-3000 is offered incustom OEM housings suitable for direct engine installation inaddition to standard pressure configurations.Incorporated in 1992, Optrand focuses on researching, developing,and manufacturing fiber-optic sensors for extreme environments.The company's products address pressure, temperature, air/fuelratio monitoring, and control requirements in the combustion engine,electrical utility, and jet engine industries.Marek Wlodarczyk, Optrand's president and CEO, told SBD  that theOPS350-3000 provides key performance and design advantages overcompeting piezoelectric and piezoresistive sensing technologies forengine monitoring/control applications. He notes that piezoelectricsensors, which are used predominantly for combustion engineresearch/testing, are expensive, and have a relatively short life, dueto their construction and to the limitations of piezoelectric materials.The silicon piezoresistive combustion pressure sensor, whichWlodarczyk indicates is also mostly used for research purposes,requires special mounting so that the temperature of the sensingelement does not exceed about 125 degrees C. Moreover, therequired size of the silicon piezoresistive sensor package (whichincludes the sensor and electronics) limits its mounting flexibility inthe engine.As noted in Multi-Channel Fiber-Optic Pressure Sensor System forMonitoring and Control of Reciprocating Engines, by T. Poorman, S.Kalishnikov, and M. Wlodarczyk, which was presented at the 10thAnnual Gas Machinery Conference & Exhibition  in October 1995,sensing crystals are unable to withstand continuous high pressures.Strain or capacitance gages used in pressure transducers exhibitlarge unrepeatable, unpredictable changes in output at hightemperatures. The changes, resulting from such effects as alloysegregation, phase changes, selective oxidation, and diffusion,ultimately lead to premature failure of the gage or lead wires.Transfer pin designs--which connect the pressure sensing diaphragmto the crystal to separate the temperature-sensitive crystal fromhigh combustion temperatures--are subject to hysteresis andrepeatability errors, resulting from response variations induced bytemperature gradients presented to the mechanical assembly.Water cooling is required for piezo-type sensors to operate over thefull range of combustion engine temperatures. The signalconditioning electronics of such sensors must be located at or nearthe sensor head to counteract strong EMI effects, which can subjectthe electronic components to temperatures exceeding 125 degrees C,thereby requiring expensive components with high-temperaturecapability. The sensing crystal and the electronic circuitry must beelectrically and thermally well-shielded, resulting in a large sensorpackage. The authors note that electronic sensors have not thus farbeen able to effectively address the overall cost, size, reliability, andhigh-temperature durability requirements for continuous enginecontrol applications.Optrand's uncomplicated intensity-modulated fiber-optic combustionpressure sensor, which uses an optical fiber in front of a flexingdiaphragm for optical reflection measurement of pressure-induceddiaphragm deflections, offers promise for satisfying the performanceand cost constraints of industrial and, over the longer-term,automotive applications.In contrast to both the piezoelectric and silicon piezoresistivecombustion pressure sensors, the OPS350-3000 does not require atransfer pin to mechanically couple the diaphragm to the sensingelement. Furthermore, in the OPS350-3000, which does not requirespecial mounting, the top of the sensing element is only 30 micronsaway from the diaphragm. The diesel combustion pressure sensor'sdiaphragm, moreover, has been optimized in terms of its operatingand overpressure range, yield strength, and fatigue life.Wlodarczyk notes that Optrand's longer-term strategy entailsoffering reliable, low-cost fiber-optic sensors for use in passengercars. The OPS350-3000 is primarily intended for larger, less price-sensitive engines. Target markets/applications include natural gasand diesel fueled engines used in power generation, marineapplications, and locomotives. Optrand's OPS350-3000 has beenevaluated for use in stationary engines for power generation; andOEMs have expressed keen interest in integrating the sensor into anew generation of engine controls.The starting prices for the OPS350-3000 sensor and signalconditioning electronics are $395 and $595, respectively. In OEMquantities (1,000 units), the sensor plus signal conditioningelectronics is available at a starting price of about $400.Significant gains in the efficiency of large-bore combustion engines,diminished levels of noxious emissions, and enhanced engine life canbe achieved via closed-loop engine controls based on combustionpressure information, according to the aforementioned paper. Theuse of cylinder pressure as a control parameter in gasoline engineshas been demonstrated to lead to optimal control of spark-timing,engine speed, throttle, air/fuel ratio, and to an optimized response toambient conditions. In-cylinder pressure sensors can also provide fordirect and deterministic misfire detection. In lean burn combustion,controlling spark timing and air/fuel ratio via in-cylindermeasurement so that "cold combustion" can occur leads results inhigh efficiency, reduced NOx emissions, and minimized torquevariability.Although reduced fuel consumption and increased torque output areobtained in large-bore engines operating under lean burn conditionsand at higher compression ratios, the increased ratio leads to agreater tendency toward engine knock. Effective knock control isfacilitated by monitoring each cylinder individually. Currently usedknock sensors mounted externally to the engine body can sufferfrom shock and vibration effects.Cylinder pressure information is of considerable value, along withother engine parameters, for engine diagnostics and healthmonitoring. Pressure trend analyses can extend maintenanceschedules and provide a warning before significant engine problemsdevelop.In addition, there are opportunities to use continuous cylinder-pressure monitoring to address existing and emerging emissionsregulations. The Clean Air ACT Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 willinduce most US operators of Stationary Reciprocating InternalCombustion Engines (SRICEs) to continuously monitor and reporttheir emissions.Some emissions sources will need to be equipped with EnhancedMonitoring/Compliance Certification (EM/CC) capability, in which amechanism, procedure, or system will be implemented to ensure thatthe unit complies with an emission limit/standard on a continuousbasis. Although cylinder pressure measurement does not providedirect information on emissions, the authors note that maintainingnominal pressure levels in all cylinders is a prerequisite for realizinglow emission levels. Moreover, cylinder pressure measurement isdescribed as the best predictor in Parametric Emissions MonitoringSystems (PEMS) that are used to predict emission levels ofcombustion emission gases, such as NOx, VOCs, and carbon monoxide(CO), without requiring direct monitoring techniques.Global revenues for fiber-optic pressure sensors are predicted toexpand at a 13.9% compound annual rate to reach $92.7 million in1999, from $37.3 million in 1992, according to Frost & Sullivan'sWorld Fiber Optic Sensor Markets  report (912-40).

The study suggests that controlmeasures prescribed for sick buildings may have to be altered toaddress microbial problems in addition to building materials."As molds and fungi grow, they give off metabolic gases that containVOC emissions," explained Dr. Charlene Bayer, principal researchscientist and director of the Georgia Institute of Technology's IndoorEnvironment Research Program (Atlanta, GA, 404-894-3825). "Someof the volatile compounds that we are finding are primary solvents;and we think some of the manufacturers are being blamed foremissions from their products when the emissions may actually becoming from the microbes. Because the VOCs have usually beenattributed to other types of sources, the source control may beincorrect."Bayer and Sidney Crow, a biologist at Georgia State UniversitySoutheast, collected fungi samples from buildings afflicted withmicrobial contamination, and allowed the samples to grow in thelaboratory. The VOCs released from the microbial broths werecollected, identified, and then compared to those detected in theambient air within the buildings."Many of the volatile compounds produced by the cultured fungi areidentical to those originating from solvent-based building materialsand cleaning supplies," Bayer noted. "These VOCs included hexane,methylene chloride, benzene, and acetone."The microbial VOCs may contribute substantially to the overall levelof ambient VOCs in buildings, according to Bayer. For example, in onebuilding the researchers scrutinized, microbial contamination wasclearly evident on the walls, carpets, and other locations."The concentration of hexane--a solvent commonly used in cleaningfluids, paints, and adhesives--was extremely high, but no source ofhexane could be found," Bayer stated. "The microbial contaminationcould have been the source of the hexane."Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus are among the myriad ofcommonly occurring microbes that can beset homes, schools, andoffices. Typically, a foul, musty odor is the initial indication of theirpresence. The rampant growth of such microbes produces headaches,itchy eyes, rashes, and respiratory problems.Conditions favorable for stimulating microbial growth include heatand moisture. In the Southeast's semi-tropical climate, buildings aremajor targets for microbial contamination.Molds and fungi are not particular about what they eat, and willdevour nearly any organic material, including the dirt and dusttrapped within ventilation systems. To ameliorate the risk ofmicrobial contamination, one should first seek ways to reduce therequired nutrient base."Under ideal conditions, a building's ventilation system should filterout both the microbes and the dirt they feed upon," Bayer indicated."Unfortunately, however, many homes, schools, and small officebuildings use cheap, throwaway filters in their ventilation systems."Cheap furnace filters are merely "boulder catchers," Bayer remarks."They only catch the big stuff. They don't catch the fine dustparticles, and they don't catch the microbes. So, they really don't doanything to help human health." Bayer recommends discarding thecheap filters and replacing them with more efficient, albeit moreexpensive, ones.However, the problems with ventilation systems increase with thesize of the building. In the fiberglass-lined ductwork often used fornoise control in larger office buildings, the fibers tend to trap dirt,which provides a rich nutrient base for the microbes."Add a little moisture, and you have a mold garden growing in yournetwork," Bayer declared. "The microbes grow and multiply, andthen get blown all over the building to infest other areas." Moisturecontrol is vital for preventing microbial contamination, sincemicrobial growth can skyrocket when the humidity rises. "Manybuildings erected in the Southeast simply were not designed tohandle the heavy humidity loads we have, particularly during ourhot, muggy summers," Bayer remarked. "And most building ownersdon't run their ventilation systems continuously."Schools typically turn their systems off during the summer months;and most office buildings cycle their systems over nights andweekends, often creating an unpleasant "Monday morning cocktail"for the workers. Such intermittent operation permits the humidity toincrease and the molds to multiply.Preventive maintenance encompasses proper filtration, correctmoisture control, and periodic cleaning of the entire ventilationsystem, including the humidifier assembly on residential furnaces."Typical reservoir humidifiers are little mold factories," Bayer notes."They are just pools of standing, stagnant water throughout much ofthe year that allow mold to grow and infiltrate the ducts. Theyshould be cleaned regularly."A considerable amount of research remains to be conducted,including identifying individual metabolic gases and their respectiveodors, and acquiring a greater understanding of the microbes thatare producing them. The human response to molds and fungi, and thesources of complaints in buildings can be more fully understood, oncea knowledge base is developed in these areas."Ultimately, we want to identify the microbial contamination on thebasis of the odors which are present," Bayer states. "That way, wewill be able to identify the source much more quickly and accurately,and deal with the problem faster and more effectively...before itbecomes a major problem requiring extensive remediation."SBD  forecasts that global revenues for gas sensors used in buildingand safety applications will rise at a 9.4% compound annual rate tototal $185 million in 2000, compared to about $108 million in 1994.Revenues for the Western European HVAC (heating, ventilating, andair conditioning) market for gas sensors are forecast to increase atmore than a 28% average annual rate to reach about $16.8 million in1998, from nearly $3.8 million in 1992, according to Frost &Sullivan's European Gas Sensor Markets  report (1902-40).

The heat flow detected by thesensors is monitored by a minicontroller that calculates, after inputof anthropomorphic measurements, actual calorie expenditures. Thecalorie sensor provides an accuracy comparable to that of oxygenconsumption measurements.Measuring energy expenditure is reportedly quite difficult. A widelyaccepted method of indirectly assessing energy expenditure is tomeasure oxygen consumption. Directly measuring energyexpenditure requires expensive equipment and a controlledenvironment, and is, therefore, limited to laboratory settings. Otherattempts at measuring energy expenditure, such as heart ratemonitors and motion sensors (accelerometers), have limitationswhich adversely affect their measurement accuracy. Heart rate is notwell-correlated to calorie expenditures. Accelerometers cannotmeasure calorie expenditure during static activity, and do notaccurately measure such expenditures during vertical motion (e.g.,bike riding, stair climbing).MOI's extremely sensitive calorie sensor actually measures theamount of heat the body releases; and continuously, directlymeasures the amount of calories that are "burned" by an individualregardless of whether he/she is resting, sleeping, or vigorouslyexercising. Key characteristics of the sensor include: simplecalibration (merely input height and weight); no usage restrictions(all activities are accurately monitored, and 24 hour/day, 365day/year use is possible); and design parameters are limited only byelectronics and sensing area considerations.The determination of calorie expenditures is a vital component of aweight control or fitness program. The MOI calorie sensor can beconfigured as a watch-like consumer product for people wishing tolose weight, or as a medical device for monitoring the calorierequirements of patients with specific caloric needs, includingdiabetics and critical care patients. The sensor can also be analternative or adjunct tool for oxygen consumption measurements forresearchers.The calorie sensor is touted as the "next step" in the ongoingdevelopment of personal diagnostics (i.e., glucose meters, homecholesterol tests, pregnancy tests, blood pressure meters, pulse andheart rate monitors) that has broad applicability to consumermarkets, since it offers individuals more control over their lives. Thegenesis of the product--which embodies significant research andproduct development--was guided by numerous focus groups ofpotential consumers (including people in exercise, wellness, anddieting programs), as well as endocrinologists, diabetologists, exercisephysiologists, and weight-loss industry executives. The resultsindicate to MOI that there is a very substantial market for the caloriesensor.Prototype units are available, and have been used extensively byuniversity researchers in studying metabolism and obesity. Thesystem consists of two components--the sensor unit and the displayunit. A low power RF transmitter is used for communication with thedisplay unit. Capable of being either a simple LCD display or a moresophisticated PC-based analysis system, the display unit uses aprefabricated receiver to minimize design complexity. Patents for thecalorie sensor have been filed worldwide; and the first US patentshould be issued this spring. MOI seeks a licensee or partner forcreating a final design, manufacturing, and marketing.A medical product development company, MOI has developedsuccessful and creative technology (including the BMC Accu-ChekAdvantage glucose system). The company specializes in applyingsensor technology to the needs of the medical marketplace, and hasparticular expertise in biosensors and heat flow sensors. MOI--whoseprincipals are Neil Szuminsky and Paul Pottgen--has licensed patentsto sensor technology that have become highly successful products inthe consumer health care market.Civilian, free global demand for calorimeters/thermal sensors isprojected to total 406.9 mil. DM (about $203.4 million at theexchange rate of 2.0 DM for the dollar), compared to 278.9 mil. DM(about $139.4 million) in 1991, according to Prognos AG's SensorTechnology 2000  report.Back to Headline List CopyrightSENSOR BUSINESS DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary, 1996BSAC AND CDS-PENN STATE TO INVESTIGATE PZT FILMS FOR MEMSSTRUCTURESThe Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center (BSAC, 510-643-6690)) atthe University of California, Berkeley and the Center for DielectricStudies (CDS) at Pennsylvania State University have been awardedfunding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), under the TieGrant Industry/University/NSF Cooperative Research Program, toconduct a mutually supportive research program on thin dielectricand piezoelectric films applied to MEMS structures. The two-yearprogram is budgeted at $25,000 per year to each institution. Theprincipal investigators are Professor R.S. Muller at BSAC, andProfessors J.P Dougherty and Susan Trolier-McKinstry at CDS-PennState.The two Centers will utilize their expertise to characterize films andfilm preparation technologies from all sources, with the aim ofestablishing reliable processes for producing dielectric andpiezoelectric films for MEMS applications. A key goal of the researchis to increase by at least an order of magnitude (a factor of 10) theperformance of piezoelectrically activated microdevices byimplementing highly active piezoelectric films--mainly PZT (lead-zirconate-titanate)--in MEMS devices.Fundamental work on surface micromachined devices, microsystems,and components has been conducted at BSAC. Piezoelectric deviceshave been built and integrated with silicon microelectronics,primarily using thin-film zinc oxide (ZnO), a considerably less activepiezoelectric than PZT. Such zinc oxide devices--includingmicrominiature microphones and sound sources, acoustic wavesensors, and fluid pumps--are expected to exhibit markedlyenhanced performance, as a result of substituting a highly activepiezoelectric material, such as PZT, for ZnO.Recognizing the need for improved piezoelectric films, BSAC hasbegun producing PZT thin films by using a state-of-the-art, one-third-million-dollar advanced sputtering system. Moreover, otherfabrication facilities at UC Berkeley are starting to produce PZT; i.e.,within the Department of Materials Science and Minerals Engineering(under Professor T. Sands), and the Integrated Materials Laboratory.CDS-Penn State has amassed a strong background in the preparationand properties of PZT; and has conducted cutting-edge research inthe fabrication, and underlying physics of thin-film dielectric,piezoelectric, and ferroelectric materials. CDS-Penn State researchershave the background and equipment for extensive testing of filmmaterials.In PZT Dielectrics for MEMS Applications --the proposal for the NSFgrant--the principal investigators note that piezoelectric andferroelectric films are finding an increasing number of applications inthe rapidly expanding MEMS field. Achieving a fundamentalunderstanding, reliability, and control over the fabrication of suchfilms is necessary to transform these advances into practical, reliableengineering products. The need for piezoelectric film expertise is aparticular challenge for the US."In Japan, piezoelectrics have been incorporated into importantcommercially successful products (starting with camera-focusingdrivers) for some years." Japanese researchers have focused on PZTfor microactuation, and have demonstrated considerable expertisewith the thin-film material. In the US, however, thin-film dielectricsand piezoelectrics--especially PZT--are still primarily a focus area atresearch laboratories. Via the tie-grant research, and the corporatememberships of the two Centers, highly active piezoelectric, and highquality dielectric, films for MEMs will be demonstrated to Americanindustry.CDS has extensively studied piezoelectric materials--in bulk,multilayer, thick- and thin-film forms--for their dielectric andpiezoelectric properties. The most useful piezoelectric materials areferroic nature--either ferroelectrics or closely related substances.The intimate coupling between the piezoelectric and dielectricproperties in ferroics necessitates that both be completelycharacterized to understand the materials and the physicalmechanisms responsible for their properties.A central focus of the study is to understand the role of PZT filmmicrostructure, film composition, and electrode materials relative tothe observed response and charge storage in thin films of thematerial. The dielectric and electromechanical properties of the filmswill be studied using a wide variety of standard characterizationtechniques, along with transmission electron microscopy and doublebeam interferometry.One of the open questions concerning the use of thin-film PZT sensorsand actuators is the degree to which non-180o domain wallscontribute to piezoelectric activity. In commercial (bulk) piezoelectricactuators, typically up to half the strain obtained is associated withdomain-wall motion.However, thin films are mechanically clamped by the substrate, andgenerally have a considerably smaller grain size than bulk materials.Since each of these factors can lead to clamping of the domain-wallcontribution to the dielectric and piezoelectric properties, it isunclear what piezoelectric constants should be assumed for the filmin designing MEMS devices. The study will elucidate the role ofdomain walls in controlling the piezoelectric properties of PZT thinfilms, and provide a set of useful piezoelectric properties for MEMSdesigners.BSAC envisions a variety of surface micromachined devicesemploying PZT films, including cantilevered actuators, microgripperswith integral-force feedback, and accelerometers. The principalinvestigators expect activating films of PZT to play a vital role thatcannot be matched by alternative piezoelectrics, such as ZnO. Forexample, in-plane microgrippers presently in fabrication require thelarge piezoelectric coupling offered by PZT for the desired deflectionamplitudes; and the sensitivity of piezoelectrically-basedaccelerometers will be significantly bolstered by the large couplingcoefficients of PZT. Joel Nice, BSAC's manager, indicated that PZTaccelerometers would offer such advantages as increased sensitivity,greater frequency range, and instantaneous readout.SBD  projects that global revenues for automotive and non-automotive silicon micromachined accelerometers will increase at a27.2% compound annual rate to reach $169.5 million in 2000,compared to about %50.9 million in 1995.Worldwide revenues for piezoelectric accelerometers are projected at$116.7 million in 1996, according to Frost & Sullivan's WorldAcoustic and Vibration Sensors and Test Instruments Market  report(727-30).The US market for microactuators is projected to total about 2 millionECU (approximately $2.6 million at the current exchange rate) in1995 and 30 million ECU (about $38.7 million) in 2000, according tosgt Sensor Consulting Dr. Guido Tschulena's (Wehrheim, Germany,++49-6081-56168) Micromechanics  report.Back to Headline List CopyrightSENSOR BUSINESS DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary, 1996SENSORS AND ACTUATORS ARE BECOMING THE SOUL OF THEMACHINEThe application of sensors and actuators is becoming increasinglyimportant for controlling machines and plants, and is determiningthe internal competition of machine building companies, according toa detailed investigation of the current state and key trends in the useof sensors and actuators in the German and Dutch machine buildingindustry.The study, conducted by sgt Sensor Consulting Dr. Guido Tschulena,scrutinized six selected sectors of the machine building industry inGermany and The Netherlands: agricultural and horticulturalmachines; textile machinery; lifting and handling equipment; wood,furniture, and paper machinery; and packing and packagingmachinery.Electronics control and sensors/actuators accounted for 14.5% and3.65%, respectively, of the total selling value of the machines. Theshare of the total machine value attributed to sensors and actuatorsfor each machine building segment is: packaging machinery-3.3%;lifting and handling equipment-4.5% (floor conveyor and stocksystems-12.8%; passenger, mass, and part loads transport-2.1%);textile machinery-5.6%; woodworking and processing machinery-3.4%; machinery for food and beverages-1.9%; and agriculturalmachinery-2.3%.Information--including the degree of automation in the selectedsectors, and the specific profit for the machine builders--has beengathered from 122 companies, representing 253 machine products.The sensors that are commercially available at present only partiallyfulfill the product requirements, such as quality, reliability, andfreedom from maintenance.The investigation demonstrates that the use of sensors and actuatorsis enhancing the economy of machines and plants and boosting thequality of fabricated goods. The high technical standard of themachine builder is reflected in their ability to integrate appropriatesensors and actuators into the machines. Moreover, the utilization ofsensors and actuators provides a powerful tool for machine buildersto differentiate their products from those of their competitors.Figure 1 shows the percentage share of various types of sensors thatare used in the German- and Dutch-built machines, based on theresponses of 122 companies, encompassing 253 machines. The shareof the various types of actuators used in such machines is:micromechanical-5%; electric-80%; pneumatic-51%; mechanical-33%;and hydraulic-36%.The investigation was conducted for Centrum voor Micro-Elektronica.The 170-page report is available in English for 150 Guilders (about$93 at the current exchange rate) from: Mr. A.W. van Schadewijk,CME Centrum voor Micro-Elektronica, Postbus 1001, NL 3900 BAVeenendaal, The Netherlands.Back to Headline List CopyrightSENSOR BUSINESS DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary, 1996NANO-ENGINEERED MATERIALS IMPROVE SENSOR PERFORMANCESensor technology can significantly benefit from nano-engineeredmaterials (i.e., materials whose grain sizes have been precisionengineered at scales of less than 100 nanometers, a shown in Figure2), notes Dr. Tapesh Yadav, president of Nanomaterials ResearchCorporation (NRC, Tucson, AZ, 520-294-7115). Such materials exhibita very high interfacial area and a unique blend of physical andelectrochemical properties.When their grain size is reduced below 10 nanometers, conventionalmaterials exhibit unique properties because quantum confinementeffects increasingly become dominant. The confinement effectsenable a blend of mechanical properties that simplify and acceleratesensor fabrication. Moreover, the nano-engineering of sensors allowsfor miniaturization to sub-micron levels. The high interfacial area,unique electrochemical properties, confinement effects, andpackaging advantages of nano materials offer an opportunity forengineering sensors in general, particularly chemical sensors, thatprovide substantially improved sensitivity, selectivity, responsetime, stability, and reliability.Under NASA and ARPA sponsorship, a team of scientists at NRC andthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is developing arange of nano-engineered sensors (NANOSENSORS(TM)) for industrial,domestic, and medical applications. The effort has alreadydemonstrated several sensors with superior performance. Forexample, nano-engineered oxygen sensors have been prepared froma ceramic composite.Such oxygen sensors are easier to prepare than conventional oxygensensors because of the ease in which the ceramic layer can be mademore fully dense without losing its interface area. Nano-engineeredoxygen sensors can operate at temperatures of less than 500 degreesC (which is nearly half the temperature required by conventionaloxygen sensors), and exhibit enhanced selectivity, stability, andresponse time. Furthermore, nano-engineered hydrogen sensors havebeen found to exhibit an order of magnitude higher sensitivity.Applications for nano-engineered sensors that are underinvestigation include automobiles, neonatal care, industrial processmonitoring, and domestic safety. In automobiles, low-temperatureoxygen sensing can facilitate more rapid control of enginecombustion during cold-engine ignition; and oxygen sensors withenhanced stability and sensitivity can help control optimalfuel/oxygen stoichiometry and reduce NOx emissions. Nano-engineered humidity sensors can help provide auto-control ofhumidity inside the passenger cabin.By utilizing lower energy consuming, less intrusive, more sensitivenano-engineered sensors, health care quality can be bolstered, whilereducing costs in intensive care units and for premature babies. Inthe industrial area, NRC sensors are particularly suited for moderatetemperature (RT to 700 degrees C) process monitoring in thechemical, metallurgical, and utility industries. In addition, nano-engineered sensors can enable more reliable technology withreduced false alarms for domestic monitoring of carbon monoxideand VOCs.To meet the anticipated market and product developmentrequirements for nano-engineered sensors, NRC is also scaling-up itspatent-pending synthesis process for bulk producing the precursorsnecessary for preparing nano-engineered sensors. The process iscapable of producing precision distributed, 1 to 100 nanometer scalepowders of sensor precursors (ceramics, metals, intermetallics,composites). The effort is sponsored in part by NASA, the DOE, the USArmy, and the NSF. Moreover, several leading corporations haveinitiated discussions with NRC regarding focused, milestone-basedstrategic alliances for meeting their anticipated needs for next-generation sensors.Revenues for the US market for automotive lambda oxygen sensorsare forecast to increase at a 20% compound annual rate to reach $465million in 1998, from $156 million in 1992, according to Frost &Sullivan's Industrial Gas Sensor Markets  report (2661-40).

The growth over the forecast period will beprimarily driven by California and federal OBD (On-BoardDiagnostics)-II requirements necessitating that the vehicle self-diagnose/monitor the hydrocarbon conversion efficiency of thecatalyst system, which began to take effect in new emissions controlsystems during the 1994 model year.The automotive industry is now mainly using a dual oxygen sensorsystem (rather than a single oxygen sensor) to diagnose the catalyst'sdeterioration and monitor its hydrocarbon performance. However,the dual oxygen sensor method has limitations for addressingincreasingly stringent automotive emissions monitoringrequirements, since it essentially measures the catalyst's oxygenstorage capacity, rather than catalyst hydrocarbon conversionefficiency. By circa the end of the decade, the growth in theautomotive oxygen sensor market is expected to be negativelyimpacted by competition from other gas sensors that are capable ofmore directly monitoring low levels of key (non-oxygen) exhaustgases to diagnose the catalyst's efficiency.Back to Headline List CopyrightSENSOR BUSINESS DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary, 1996INNOVATIVE SENSORS COULD REFRESH AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMSHokuriku Electric Industry Co.

Islandia, N.Y.-based Alcohol SensorsInternational Ltd. topped off several years of intensive R&D with aninitial public offering of its stock in mid-November, and already hasseen its market value double.  From an initial price of 7 on NASDAQ,ASI's stock price had risen to 12 5/8 at our deadline.     The frenzied reception by investors is no surprise to ASIPresident and CEO Robert Whitney, who told SENSOR BUSINESS NEWS hisfirm's technological superiority should help ASI rake in $50 millionin sales during 1996.     ASI claims its sensor, called the Sens-O-Lock, is superior tocompeting products since it never needs to be recalibrated and iseasier to use because of its unique, open-chamber technology, whichrequires no direct mouth contact to take a breath sample and test forthe presence of alcohol.     "There is no question we lead the way.  We've spent tons of timeand money for the best mousetrap in the world," said Whitney.     But the chief executive of LifeSafer Interlock Inc., ofCincinnati, Ohio, which makes a competing product, questioned thecredibility of a product that never is checked for accuracy once it isinstalled.  He said sensors used for such critical tasks ought to beverified regularly, as is his firm's LifeSafer.     "I wouldn't want the liability associated with it," saidLifeSafer President Richard Freund.  "I think that's a real big issue. It exposes a publicly traded company to a lot of liability problems."  ...State Laws Create Market     In as many as 32 states, authorities have the option to require adriver convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) to have an alcoholsensor installed in his or her vehicle as a condition of retainingtheir driver's license.     Once the vehicle begins moving, the devices ask randomly foranother sample.  If the driver fails, the unit will flash thevehicle's external lights and sound the horn if the vehicle is notbrought to a stop within a brief period.     ASI also wants to sell the device to parents and others who wanta means of preventing their families from driving drunk.     In all cases, the device will be installed by specially trainedtechnicians who work for firms that install car alarm systems, Whitneysaid.  Drivers who use the device under court order will return to thetechnician regularly to enable authorities to keep tabs on whether thesystem has detected alcohol and how often it has been used.     Auto safety experts vouch for the effectiveness of the devices inkeeping alcohol-impaired people from operating their vehicles.  "Wesupport ignition interlocks if they are set up properly," said JohnUndeland, spokesman for the American Automobile Association'sWashington, D.C.-area division.  "The only downside, if there is one,is that once the system is in place, it doesn't change people [whohave alcohol problems].  They still drink, but they just can't drive."     Carl Ekstein, vice president of marketing and businessdevelopment for Rockville, Md.-based Life Sciences Corp., whichinstalls and maintains LifeSafer units in several mid-Atlantic states,agreed.  "These devices are highly effective in stopping repeatoffenders.  Our experience is that less than 1 percent of people usingthe sensor are rearrested for DWI," Ekstein told us.     Whitney told us ASI plans to market the Sens-O-Lock in twoversions.  Equipped with a data logger, the device will be used bypeople who have been ordered by authorities to do so.  Whitney saidthe market in just the United States is perhaps $300 million per year.   ...Voluntary Market Expected to Be Larger     ASI charges about $600 per year for each data logger-equippeddevice.  But officials said they expect to realize the majority oftheir revenue from sales of the Sens-O-Lock to municipalities andbusinesses for use on their vehicle fleets, and from retail sales of asimpler, Sens-O-Lock stripped of the data recording capabilities andpriced at about $429.     "We see this as going into every school bus, locomotive andsubway train," said ASI Director of Marketing Frank Savarese.     But Ekstein questioned ASI's ability to crack the voluntarymarket.  "I've already tried it and I'm not deluged with requests. It's hard to get enough cases for market research," he told us.     Freund said the Sens-O-Lock's positioning as a product theconsumer can have installed and never have to adjust could be aproblem.  "I understand their motivation [in wanting to sell toconsumers]," he said.  "We have looked at the possibility of a simpleproduct, but if we put it out for the consumer market, we wouldrequire that it be periodically recalibrated.  We have some voluntaryusers, but they are a small percentage.  We focus on DWI offenders."     ASI also may have overstated the size of the market for ignitioninterlock devices, Freund said.  "The market is 10 years old, and atthe end of 1995 about 20,000 people had the devices in their cars," hetold us.  "That's about a $15 million market, and we have half of it."     ASI's Whitney remains undeterred and said that all told, theworldwide market for vehicle alcohol sensors could one day top thebillion-dollar figure.     In addition to making a big splash in the market for alcoholsensors, ASI hopes to expand into sensing other substances, althoughWhitney declined to provide details.  "We will be a major player inthe sensor world," he predicted.(AAA Potomac, John Undeland, 703/222-4100; ASI, Robert Whitney,516/342-1515; Life Sciences Corp., Carl Ekstein, 301/212-9222;LifeSafer Interlock, Richard Freund, 800/531-0006.)Back to Headline List CopyrightSENSOR BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996AFTER A YEAR OF TURMOIL AND GROWING PAINS, SENSORMATIC WANTS A CALMER1996     Sensormatic Electronics Corp., buffeted last year byimproprieties in its accounting practices and by disappointing salesfollowing a banner year in 1994, hopes new President and ChiefOperating Officer Robert Vanourek--who joined Sensormatic in October1995--will improve its fortunes this year.     The Boca Raton, Fla.-based company's stock price on the New YorkStock Exchange fell by more than half during the second half of 1995,to 17 3/8 at our deadline.  The stock tumbled in mid-December afterofficials told shareholders the company would take an unspecifiedcharge as part of a restructuring effort to strengthen results.     "The company last year had a lot of trouble attributable to itsphenomenal success and growth," said a source close to Sensormatic. "The company's growth outpaced its infrastructure.  Things havehappened so rapidly that they really weren't able to put the checksand balances in place."     Officials would not specify what steps they plan to take torejuvenate the company, but it is likely the company will try toimprove its financial recordkeeping, keep close tabs on expenses, andboost productivity.  Executives said it was too early to say how muchthe changes would cost, but the sour response from Wall Street to therestructuring announcement suggests investors remain somewhatskeptical of the company.  ...Checkpoint's Presence Formidable     Although Sensormatic counts among its customers most of theworld's largest retailers, it continues to face a strong challengefrom arch rival Checkpoint Systems Inc., of Thorofare, N.J.     "We have lost the momentum in drug stores and there is aggressivecompetition in the food market," Vanourek acknowledged to shareholdersDec. 14, "but we will not concede any market to any competitor."      Checkpoint officials said their firm is poised to control about75 percent of the drug store theft control market.  Overall sales atCheckpoint grew more than 60 percent for the nine months ended Sept.24, 1995, even as sales at Sensormatic were soft.     Expect Sensormatic to continue its attack on Checkpoint as ittries to solidify its dominant position in loss prevention and renewits commitment to the retail market.  A possible tactic could beemphasizing the advantages of Sensormatic's magnetic technologycompared with Checkpoint's radio frequency-based equipment, which hasbeen called unreliable by some critics.     "Sensormatic will hit Checkpoint hard over the issue of how itstechnology can be fooled," our source told us.  "Sensormatic iscertainly going to use that as ammunition."Back to Headline List CopyrightSENSOR BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996SENSOR FIRMS WORK TO BUILD BLOOD SUGAR SENSORS FOR DIABETICS     Several sensor companies are racing to give diabetics relief fromthe daily finger-pricking required to monitor their blood glucoselevels and to enable better management of the troublesome disease.     San Diego-based Synthetic Blood International Inc. told SENSORBUSINESS NEWS tests on laboratory animals indicate its implantablebiosensor is nearing the point where it does not upset the immunesystem and lasts long enough to be practical.  The device, similar insome respects to a pacemaker, would be placed in the stomach or theabdomen and could go a year or longer between battery changes, saidSynthetic's Alan Brunson.  It would provide measurements as often asevery seven minutes.     Meanwhile, MiniMed Inc., of Sylmar, Calif., reported it plans tostart a clinical trial of its glucose sensor by late this year.  Thesensor is designed to be inserted subcutaneously by diabetics.  Analarm would signal abnormal blood sugar levels.     "I don't think people know how bad people who are diabetics haveit," said Synthetic Blood President and CEO Gerald Schlatter.  "It isreally a different way of life.  We've done market research on thisproduct and we feel that the product would be very well received."     Synthetic Blood believes the market for blood glucose sensorscould hit a billion dollars or more.  The company hopes to partnerwith a larger company to commercialize its technology, and plans humantrials by the end of 1996.     "We're versatile and we can correct mistakes easily.  Butcompanies like ours can have a tough time raising R&D money.  Largercompanies in biotechnology look for small companies like ours.  We'vehad various conversations with pacemaker and drug companies,"Schlatter told us.  ...Biocontrol Technology Points Angry Finger at the Press     The announcements from Synthetic Blood and MiniMed come asPittsburgh-based Biocontrol Technology Inc. publicly complained aboutmedia coverage of its Diasensor noninvasive blood glucose sensor,which has been in the FDA approval process for more than a year.  Thecompany already is selling the device abroad and said it expects tobegin U.S. production of the sensor this month, but Biocontrolofficials appear to be worried the company is seen in a negativelight.     The firm issued a sharply worded news release urging potentialcustomers to lambast reporters for criticizing the product's largesize and $8,000 cost, and for raising questions about its reliability.     "Biocontrol pledges that we will continue to focus on getting theDiasensor...through the process necessary to market it and that wewill not be stopped by any negative or uninformed sources who wouldprefer, for known and unknown reasons, to have us fail," the releasesaid.  "...It is very difficult to believe that the timing [of thecriticism] is simply a matter of coincidence."     A Biocontrol spokeswoman did not return phone calls from SENSORBUSINESS NEWS to discuss the issue.       (Synthetic Blood's Schlatter said he does not anticipatedifficulty when the time comes to get FDA approval to market thecompany's product.)     In a related matter, Biocontrol and Diasense Inc., which jointlyhave developed the Diasensor, said they planned to combine theiroperations sometime in the first quarter of this year.  Officials saidthe merger was in the financial best interest of the Diasensorproject.

When the airbag deploys, itcan injure or kill a child riding in a car safety seat, say experts.       A solution is for the child to ride in the back seat, but somevehicles, such as pick-ups, do not have rear seats.  In any case, manyparents feel more comfortable with their children beside them as theydrive.     Siemens Automotive Corp. believes it has a better answer.  TheAuburn Hills, Mich.-based unit of German multinational Siemens AG lastmonth introduced a sensor designed to deactivate the passenger airbagif a specially equipped child safety seat is directly in its path.     As an added benefit, the system also will turn off the airbag ifthe seat is empty, saving the considerable cost of replacing theairbag in the event of a collision that otherwise would cause it toactivate.     Beginning late this year, 1997-badged cars from two unnamedEuropean luxury carmakers will come with the sensors as standardequipment, accounting for some 600,000 vehicles worldwide, saidSiemens spokesman David Ladd.       Chrysler, Ford and General Motors also are "enthusiastic," hesaid.  The cost to the automakers will be under $40 per vehicle, Laddtold us.     The system uses pressure-sensitive foil within the seat to detectweight greater than 25 pounds.  Sensors at either side of the seatlook for devices on specially-equipped safety seats and will disablethe airbag if the seat is rear-facing or at an angle.     Ladd said safety seat makers in Europe already have agreed to putthe equipment on their seats, and U.S. makers are likely to followsuit.  The modifications cost boost the seat prices by about 5percent, he said.     Within a few years, other sensing systems--perhaps based onoptical or radar technology--should appear and eliminate the need forspecially equipped child seats, Ladd said.  Today, such alternativesystems are considered too unreliable and are cost-prohibitive, hetold us.     Ladd said Siemens will discourage retrofitting existing vehiclesor child safety seats with the technology.  "The strategy is toinstall the equipment at the point of manufacture," said Ladd.  "It'smore reliable."     Some 1996 vehicles will come equipped with a key-operated switchto disable the front passenger airbag, but whether people will use theswitch properly is questionable, experts say.

Southwood, England-based First Technology PLC reported sales of$28 million for the six-month period that ended Oct. 31, 1995, up ahealthy 10.2 percent.  Profits grew to almost $5.1 million, a gain ofsome 16 percent.  The company predicts strong sales in 1996 even ifworldwide demand for cars falls, as its safety products are installedon a greater proportion of new vehicles.     Much of the growth is a result of the company's growingdomination of the market for the fuel cut-off sensors, which disengagea car's fuel system in the event of a crash, said Chairman FredWestlake.  In November, First Technology opened a factory in easternFrance to increase its capacity to produce the sensors (SEN, Dec. 6,1995, p. 3).  The company also has facilities in the United States.

That iswhen Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz will join Volvo in offering the safetysystems as standard equipment on all their models.     For 1996, several Mercedes models offer the side airbags.  Mostpeople do not yet know about side airbags, so few purchasing decisionsare likely to hinge on their presence for now, said Len Logue, whosells Mercedes vehicles in Silver Spring, Md.     The situation at Volvo is different.  The Swedish automaker--longassociated with "safety" in car buyers' minds--was the firstmanufacturer to offer the equipment, and an official said side airbagsare growing increasingly important to prospective customers.     "People with one- and two-year-old Volvos want to trade theircars in for cars with the side airbags," Volvo District Sales ManagerRobert Brissie told us at the Washington, D.C., International AutoShow last week.     That could be a sign that well-heeled car buyers are beginning toconclude that side airbags add a significant measure of safety, evenas they realize widespread availability is still in the future.  Onceseveral manufacturers offer the technology as standard equipment,others are likely to follow quickly, in a manner similar to the wayfront airbags proliferated after automakers discovered many buyersconsider them essential.  ...Truck Buyers See it Differently      Even as some luxury car buyers are eager to buy cars equippedwith the latest safety gear, it appears demand for the equipmentdepends, in part, on perception, perhaps even more than on hard facts. One salesman told us people looking for pickup trucks are sometimesconvinced the size of the vehicle makes airbags unnecessary.     "In the past year, I don't think one customer has asked me if thevehicles have airbags," he said.  Some buyers inquire about safetyfeatures after the sale, he said, underscoring the dichotomy betweenbuyers of different types of vehicles when it comes to safety issues.     Still, federal regulations will compel at least a driver's sideairbag to be installed in all trucks sold in the United States withinthe next few years.     All passenger vehicles will come with two front airbags standardnot long afterward.  The burgeoning demand for airbags--front systemsas well as side-impact units, is good news for airbag makers Bosch,Siemens, TRW and Breed Technologies.Back to Headline List WT03-B08-27IA087-000629-B018-257http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/mg18.html 205.156.212.5 19970122034413 text/html 111973HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:42:00 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:50 GMTContent-length: 111785Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/mg18.html Sample Issue Copyright SMT TRENDS via NewsNet January 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FROM THE EDITOR (850 words) INDUSTRY OVERVIEW BULL NAMES BENDER V.P.

We appreciate the help that all of  you,who have been contacted, have given Rich.  Gatheringinformation can be a hard job because people in the industrydon't see the payback to themselves for taking the time to talk. Rich is a good interviewer, and thorough, which means thattalking to him often helps a person clarify his or her ownthinking about the nature of the market and the dynamicswithin the market.  Like any good dialogue, a conversationwith Rich can increase your enthusiasm and your knowledgeof the market.  We do not just take information when we talkto people; We try to give it back  as good as we got it.  In talking to manufacturers in the electronics industry, we getthe feeling they do not expect 1996 to be quite the year 1995was.  In particular, people don't seem to think the U.S.personal computer industry can sustain the growth of last year. We're not saying things look gloomy, only lest robust.  Webelieve, though, that there are some hopeful signs in thismarket, especially for people working with the expertise andequipment devoted to SMT.  While the market for portablecomputers has remained more sluggish than experts predicteda couple years ago, we still feel that the potential for thismarket is great.  The big factor, we feel, is price.  We kepthearing that prices on portables were going to come down atthe end of last year.  Acer's entrance into the U.S. market wassupposed to help this.  It did not happen.  If it happens thisyear, portables could cause the entire PC market to performbetter than expected.  In addition, the European market forPCs will probably be better this year than last.  Companiesable to take advantage of this market will benefit.The other area that we've been keeping our eyes on, which wethink has good potential for SMT people in 1996, is thewireless communications industry.  Some people are sayingthis market will not do as well in 1996 as it did in 1995, butwe're of the opposite opinion.  Much work with high-frequency components, along with the development of twostandards--code division multiple access (CDMA) andpersonal communication services (PCS)--, promise, we feel, tohelp the 1996 U.S. market for wireless devices outperform the1995 market.  The Yankee Group (Boston, MA) projectscellular growth will be up from $70 million in 1995 to around$100 million in 1996.  The cellular partnership formed byNynex, Bell Atlantic, U.S. West and AirTouchCommunications placed a $600 million order for new phonesfrom Motorola Inc., Nokia Oy of Finland and Audiovox Corp. This represents three million analog cellular phones over aone-year period.  PCS carriers will generate approximately$10 billion in annual revenues by the year 2000, and $18billion by 2005 according to Economic and ManagementConsultants International (New York, NY).  These newnetworks will translate into multi-billion dollar expenditures toinfrastructure providers such as AT&T, Motorola, NorthernTelecom, Ericsson and the many contract manufacturers whowork with these larger companies to produce subassemblies. While the U.S. market will be good for wirelesscommunications, developing countries, such as China will bevery good targets for wireless sales because of the lack oftraditional communications infrastructure.  Now, with thedevelopment of wireless equipment, some experts arepredicting that this traditional type of communicationsinfrastructure will never be installed in developing countries.Wireless, or non-tethered, communications devices range fromcordless telephones to mobile cellular phones to fashion-coordinated pagers.  The big news in cordless phones is themigration of digital systems operating in the 900-MHz rangeusing spread-spectrum technology.  Manufacturers expect toship more than a million such units by midyear.  In the UnitedStates, cellular telephone systems are beginning to migrate todigital technology, but there appears to be a few more years oflife remaining in analog mobile phone service.  CellularDigital Packet Data is just now being introduced as a way topiggyback digital data onto existing voice-band systems. Growth for analog cellular will remain strong throughout theyear.Somewhere between full-blown cellular systems and in-housecordless phones, is Personal Communications Services (PCS),which caused a big stir last year when the FederalCommunications Commission held auctions to sell spectrumspace in major cities.  During 1996, PCS systems will finishtheir initial build-outs and begin offering services that competewith both cellular and wire-line telephony.  In Europe, thedigital cellular system called GSM (Global System for MobileCommunications) is already a hit.  Well over one million GSMhandsets have already been sold.In South America, Africa, Asia, and many island countries,cellular and PCS phones are the only solution because aninfrastructure of wired communications services does notexist.  Almost half of all new sales of two-way wirelessequipment will be in these areas.  These wireless systems canbe set up quickly and work well.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996BULL NAMES BENDER V.P.Bull Electronics (Boston, MA) named Louis P.

A few years ago, we had the chance to sit andtalk with Koichi Nishimura, the president of Solectron.  At onepoint, we asked him to what he attributed Solectron's success. Without hesitation, he replied:  "Our people."  We like aperson who answers are quick and short.  We explored thisarea with Mr. Nishimura and found that Solectron invested alot in their employees, offering training and opportunities forthem to participate in the decision making that goes on in thecompany.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996SM SENSOR KEEPS TRACK OF FISHStar Oddi (Rykjavik, Iceland) wanted to monitor cod andAtlantic salmon in the Islandic waters.  A device was designedto periodically measure and record pressure and temperature. The data is used to compare growth of fish in differentenvironments.  The device, the DST 100, had to be smallenough to be placed internally and externally without causingproblems to the fish.  In order to produce the DST 100, asurface mountable pressure sensor, the Model 1431, wascreated by EG&G IC Sensors (Milpitas, CA).  The Model1431 pressure sensor consists of a micromachined siliconpressure sensor chip mounted on a ceramic substrate.  Aceramic lid is bonded to the ceramic base to providemechanical protection for the sensor element.  The pressuresensor chip is formed by chemically etching hundreds orthousands of thin diaphragms into a 4 in. silicon wafer.  Laterin the manufacturing process, a glass wafer is electrostaticallybonded to the silicon wafer under vacuum, sealing a vacuumreference within the sensor.  Once this has been accomplished,the wafer is sawed apart to create individual sensors.Boron impurities are implanted in selected regions of thesilicon diaphragms to form piezoresistors--resistors thatchange their electrical resistance in response to changes instrain.  Multiple resistors are interconnected into a Wheatstonebridge circuit so that a change in diaphragm strain results in aproportional change in sensor output voltage.  Afterfabrication is completed, individual chips are tested to verifythat they are functioning properly.  The chip is then attached toa ceramic substrate, wire bonds are made to form electricalconnections from the chip to the package, and a ceramic lid isepoxied to the ceramic substrate to provide mechanicalprotection for the sensor chip and the wire bonds.  Pressureenters the sensor through an opening located at the base of thetop cover.  After a conventional IR reflow process, solder onthe bottom of the ceramic substrate forms the electricalconnection to the board, or hybrid circuit.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996MICRON CMS EXPANDS SMT CAPABILITYMicron Custom Manufacturing Services Inc. (Micron CMS)began as an onsite division of Micron Technology in 1984,providing board-level product design, assembly, and testing. Micron CMS began offering contract manufacturing tovexternal customers in 1989, and established its currentautonomous location in 1990.  The operation became asubsidiary in March, 1992, and became ISO-9001 certified inFebruary 1993.  In 1995, Micron CMS, Micron Computer, Inc.and ZEOS International Ltd. entered into a merger to formMicron Electronics, Inc.  Micron CMS is currently expandingits contract manufacturing services by adding several SMTlines.  The expansion is taking place in its Boise, ID andDurham, NC plants.The Boise facility consists of 92,000 square feet in twoadjacent buildings.  Over 550 employees operate seven fullyautomatic surface mount manufacturing lines, which operate24 hours a day, seven days a week to meet customer demand. The Boise facility is scheduled to have an eighth line up andrunning by February 9 of this year. The Durham facility, established in January 1995, began withan initial investment of approximately $10 million.  It has 75employees and its third SMT line began operation on January17 of this year.  A fourth line is scheduled for delivery in mid-march, 1996, to be in production by April 1996.  The newlines in Durham  increase the floor space there from 30,000square feet to 60,000 square feet.  The Durham facility expectsISO 9002 certification in April 1995.MCMS said:  "Beyond the quality and competitive pricing allcustomers expect, we believe the significant factors in contractassembly are technology, service and cycle time.  Location isalso becoming increasingly important."Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996JAPANESE ELECTRONICS TO LOOK UPAfter five years of declines, consumer electronics output willincrease in Japan in 1996 due to the creation of new productssuch as car navigation systems and other digital devices,according to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan,which represents 600 companies.  Total production ofelectronics in 1996 will be $234 billion, up 5.7% over thisyear.  Leading the way will be higher production ofsemiconductors and components to fuel booming worldwidedemand for chips from makers of computers and mobilephones.With the reawakening of the Japanese electronics industry,there will come renewed capital spending for productionequipment.  Tencor Instruments' sales of in-line inspectionequipment to Japan constituted 16% of the company's totalrevenue in 1993, the year Japan began recovering from itseconomic slump.  In 1995,  the Japanese market made up 26%of Tencor's company revenues.  This number is expected toincrease to 28% in 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996VOLUME KEY TO SUCCESSWe received a news release from Pittiglio Rabin Todd &McGrath (PRTM) about a study they've completed:  1995High-Performance Factory Benchmarking.  We called PRTMand spoke to them about the study because it seemed like thesort of information that our subscribers would be interested in. PRTM does multi-client studies for large companies.  This onewas sponsored by AT&T, Compaq, Digital Equipment, GEMedical Systems, IBM, Nokia Mobile Phones, Nortel, PitneyBowes, Sequent and Unisys.  They don't offer the studies forsale to other companies, but, in part to advertise PRTM, butalso in part as a service to the manufacturing industry, theyrelease some of the information for the general population.PRTM's examination of manufacturing processes revealed thesignificant impact high volume had on factory costs in 1995. For example, median cost per placement for printed circuitboard assembly was 32 for factories with a volume of 25million placements, 15 for those with 200 million, and only10 for those with 800 million.  The study indicated that thehigh-tech industry has recognized the importance of volume: volumes have risen throughout the industry and reducedoverall product assembly costs.  For example, median cost perplacement for printed circuit board assembly declined by 20%since 1992, from 35  to 28 .  PRTM attributes this to thedecreasing number of low-volume producing, various factoryimprovements, and the increasing reliance on outsourcedproduction.Though median assembly costs have dropped, typicalcompanies are still lagging behind the best-in-classcompetitors--the top 20%--whose costs are at 7  perplacement.  Figures show, however, that the best-in-classcompanies saw no cost improvements during the last fewyears.  "Our numbers indicate that the influence of volumemay have topped out for the leading companies," said RajNooyi, a director at PRTM.  "However, though volume is stillkey, some of the other cost-related areas companies canaddress include plant location [offshore facilities], unique partnumbers manufactured [component mix], PCB assemblydensity, and the ratio of indirect [managers] to directemployees [operators]."Volume is also a major factor in low material acquisitioncosts.  PRTM found that the material acquisition rate--the costof acquiring the material as a percentage of materialexpenditures--varies from 1% to more than 20%.  Companieswith a volume of $25 million worth of material expenditureshad a rate of 6%, while companies at $200 million were justover 3%, and those at $800 million were at 2.3%."Again, companies buying the most material are obviouslygoing to have the lowest rates," said Nooyi, "but companiescan still find ways to remain competitive within their volumecategories.  They can improve the efficiency of theiracquisition function by examining the number of suppliers, thenumber of parts procured, percentage of material procuredfrom international sources, and the percentage of materialreceived without inspection."In the high-tech arena, where getting to market quickly meansthe difference between market leadership and a warehouse ofobsolete inventory, the time required to ramp up a productfrom first prototype to full-volume production is critical."With the product life cycle under 35 weeks in segments likepersonal computers and consumer electronics, the pressure oncompanies is tremendous," says Nooyi.  "The median launchand ramp-up time in the PC industry is only 10 weeks--andeach day the factory operates at less than peak capacity,hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue can be lost."A major factor in a product's manufacturing launch time is thenumber of engineering change orders (ECOs), which aretypically brought about by product design quality issues anddifficulties with component sourcing.  Best-in-class companiesspeed their development cycle times--and save significantmoney--by reducing the number of mistakes made in thedesign process.  In fact, best-in-class computer companiesgenerate 84% less ECOs within the first year of productionthan average companies.Proper management of inventory is also critical for cost,flexibility and cycle-time performance.  For example, acrossall industries, sourcing time (the time to specify and acquirematerials and components) comprises nearly 75% of the entiresource-make cycle-time--but companies that find ways toreduce sourcing time take a dramatic lead time advantage.  Inaddition, companies that improve inventory management gaincost, flexibility and cycle-time advantages.  The personalcomputing industry has proven itself a leader in this area, withfewer inventory days of supply than every other studysegment.  In fact, PC factories have reduced "work-in-progress" and "finished goods" inventories to less than oneweek of supply each."Supply-line management," known in the old days as"purchasing," has become an important new tool for gaining acompetitive advantage.  PRTM's study reveals that supply-linepractices are changing dramatically, providing companies withnew ways to speed production, save money and improvequality.  As an example, in 1995, the average computercompany obtained 80% of its material from 22 suppliers, asopposed to 31 suppliers in 1992.  These companies are alsophasing out cumbersome paper-based ordering mechanisms: 27% of transactions are now completed by EDI, compared to12% in 1992.  In addition, companies are replacing time-consuming inspection efforts with vendor certificationprograms:  in 1995, 82% of incoming material lots werereceived without inspection, an increase from 65% i 1992. Although changes in supply-line practices are industry-wide,some companies are far ahead of the pack on the issue ofsupply-line flexibility.  In the computer sector, best-in-classcompanies needed only 20 days to achieve an unplanned 20%increase in production, while median companies needed 56days.  These same best-in-class companies can also moreeasily adjust to a downturn, sustaining an average 94% orderreduction within 45 days of scheduled product delivery withno inventory or cost penalty.  The average company can onlysustain a 20% reduction for the same amount of time. Companies that can't respond quickly to changes in themarketplace run the risk of out-of-control inventory and lostrevenue.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996WORLD'S FIRST SM RESETTABLE FUSE FOR TELECOM EQUIPMENTRaychem's PolySwitch Division (Menlo Park, CA) announcedthe world's first surface mount resettable fuse fortelecommunications equipment.  The new PolySwitch TS250helps protect telecommunications equipment from overcurrentconditions.  With an installed height of only 3.4 mm and a 9.0mm by 7.1 mm footprint, the compact TS250 resettable fusehas a 60% lower profile than previous through-holePolySwitch devices for telecommunications equipment.  Likeother SM parts that Raychem manufactures, the TS250 issupplied in tape and reel that is compatible with standardindustry pick and place equipment in high-volumemanufacturing environments.  The part is designed to bereflowed onto boards using convection, IR, and hot-airtechniques.  PolySwitch resettable fuses are designed tooperate repeatedly and reliably.  Unlike one-use fuses, theyautomatically reset after a fault condition is cleared.  Whenshort circuits or overcurrent conditions occur, a conductivepolymer, sandwiched between two metal electrodes, increasesin resistance, limiting the current.  In this high resistance state,the device remains latched until the fault clears.  Resettingoccurs when the power is interrupted and the fault is removed. The device then cools and enables the polymer to revert to aconductive state.  The TS250 is priced as low as $0.35depending on volume.  Lead times are six to eight weeks.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996AVX ADDS 2 MLCC LINESOne of the mainstay passive components, along with theresistor, is the capacitor, whose primary responsibility intoday's electronic circuits is as a decoupling device:  a shuntused to maintain proper voltage levels within the circuit. Switching power supplies, ubiquitous elements in anelectronic circuit, are an important application area forcapacitors.  As power supplies increase in switching frequencyand decrease in size, designers are turning to specializedmultilayer ceramic chip (MLCC) capacitors to help them keepcontrol of the circuit.  The input filter of a high-speed powersupply must provide a high-current burst to the power supplywithout generating noise, and must suppress noise generatedby the switch circuitry as well.  Output filtering capacitorsmust smooth the ripple effect of the switching circuitry byabsorbing and then discharging energy during the switchingcycle.In response to demand from designers working with advancedpower supplies, AVX Corp. (Myrtle Beach, SC)  introducedtwo surface mount capacitor series:  1.  SupraCap--high-capacitance MLCCs  2.  SV--high-voltage radial MLCCsThe SupraCaps offer low equivalent series resistance (ESR) inthe milliohm range and equivalent series inductance (ESI) inthe 1-nanohenry (nH) to 4-nH range.  The SV is for highvoltage, low leakage current, and low ESR applications in asmall package.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996MLCC MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTSMost of the raw-material cost in multilayer ceramic capacitorscomes from palladium.  As a result of the rising cost ofpalladium, many ceramic-capacitor suppliers are consideringalternatives such as nickel.  Ceramics made of nickel, the innerelectrode could now account for as much as 10% of Murata'sceramic-capacitor business.  Aluminum-electrolytic capacitors,in heavy demand from power-supply makers, are in shortsupply, as is polycarbonate.  New materials that are beinginvestigated to replace some of those that are in short supplyinclude polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) andpolyethyleneaphthalate (PEN).  (PPS is used in applicationsrequiring stability at high temperatures or over a widetemperature range; PEN is appealing because it can be dippedin molten solder in the wave solder process.)Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996ATC RAMPS UP FOR MLCC DEMANDDuring the past two years American Technical Ceramics(ATC) (Huntington Station, NY) saw an unprecedenteddemand for multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs),particularly for commercial and communications applications. In 1995 the company made significant investments to upgradeproduction and process equipment for manufacturing theircore products--RF/microwave porcelain and ceramicmultilayer capacitors.  End-users of their products includeengineers in industries as diverse as wireless communications,aircraft radar, navigation systems, satellite broadcasting,medical electronics, space programs and automotiveelectronics.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996CAPACITOR NETWORKS ON THE RISENew miniaturization demands are forcing many capacitorhouses to turn to integrated, semiconductor-style siliconnetworks to achieve further reductions.  Size, performance,and pricing are becoming increasingly critical, and surface-mount packaging and thin-film technology are making inroads. A sizable chunk of future passives business could go to suchdevices, particularly for portable communications and similarapplications where size reduction is critical.  PC manufacturerswant 100% surface mount.  The whole trend in the industry isto surface mount for PCMCIA.  New high-frequencyrequirements for communications and computing are makingsuch parts more necessary all the time.  Koa Speer has theCR73 capacitor/resistor chip, a 1206 size for surface mount.The passive-networks market--made up of various thick andthin-film resistor-network configurations as well as resistor-capacitor networks--grew moderately during the early 1990s. Venture Development Corp. (Natick, MA) said U.S. shipmentsof the products grew from $1993.7 million in 1988, to $250.8million in 1993.  A resurgence in the computer industry,coupled with an interest in surface-mount designs, has helpedthe passive-networks market maintain modest growth.  Theform factor continues to shrink.  Under development areQSOPs, TSOPs, and narrow-body SO designs.  Small formfactors mean passive networks are offered, increasingly, insurface-mount packages.  The mix of surface-mount andthrough-hole resistor networks is currently about 50-50.  Butfuture designs are leaning more toward surface-mountpackages.The name of the game is reducing size and increasingfrequency.  Performance level of surface-mount devices--insome cases--has been close to or equal to that of through-holetechnology.  The biggest reason for the shift to surface-mountis ease of assembly and size.  Applications that require highlevels of integration, such as cellular phones and wirelesscommunications, can generally be served better by discretecomponents.  Traditionally, networks have three or maybefour major applications:  pull-up/pull-down, termination,current limiting, and precision analog circuits.  Applications inwhich there is a need for low noise and tight tolerances,however, require thin-film resistor networks, a portion of thepassive-networks market that should gain momentum in thenext few years.Thin film has room to grow, especially where you canincorporate a resistor and a capacitor in a single package.  Themarket for thin-film resistor-capacitor networks is still in itsinfancy, but most suppliers believe it shows great promise.  Itmay still be about a year and a half before demand for theseintegrated networks begins to generate much activity.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996POROUS SILICONINCREASES CAPACITOR PERFORMANCEPresent-day capacitors suffer several drawbacks.  Electrodesmade of dielectric materials such as polystyrene or SiO2 have alow surface-to-volume ratio.  Increasing the electrode area byetching or sintering techniques such as those used foraluminum or tantalum capacitors suffers the disadvantages ofanodically formed oxides.  The strong temperature andelectric-field dependence of the dielectric constant in ceramicdevices remains a drawback.  To resolve the limitations ofstandard capacitors, porous silicon technology has beendeveloped by Siemens (Munich, Germany) to fashion novelcapacitors by combining an electrochemically enlargedelectrode surface with high-performance dielectric thin-filmlayers.  The macroporous silicon, that was used as a substratefor capacitors, has pores with a diameter in the micrometerregime and a depth of several hundred micrometers.  Using astandard microelectronic process, the capacitor structure iscompleted with the deposition of dielectric films and apolysilicon electrode.  In principle, the electrochemicalprocess allows the pore diameter to be reduced to values closeto atomic dimensions.  Reducing lateral dimensions in thisway would increase the specific capacitance to values around20 mFV/mm3.  This would surpass the values for the besttantalum or aluminum electrolytic capacitors without thepolarity and high-ESR drawbacks of these technologies.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996PCMCIA DESIGN REQUIRE FLEXIBILITYOne of the products that helped make 1996 such a good yearfor the electronics industry was the PCMCIA card.  Since the1992 introduction of the first FPGAs, in thin quad flat pack(TQFP) packages, static RAM-based FPGAs have been usedsuccessfully in hundreds of PCMCIA designs, includingmemory cards, I/O cards, and host systems.  The biggestchallenge of PCMCIA card designs is to fit the requiredfunctionality into the available space.  High-integration levelsare needed to meet size and power constraints.  As a result, themost popular PCMCIA IC technologies feature highintegration levels and include memories, chip sets, customASICs (including gate arrays), and FPGAs.  Application-specific approaches allow for the customization of the businterface and integration of other logic.  Custom ICdevelopment is only feasible, however, when the design isfixed and fairly large volumes are required.  This is becausesuch development typically involves lengthy design andprocurement cycles and high engineering costs.As a result, many designers have turned to FPGAs, whichprovide high integration levels without the lengthydevelopment cycles, design risk, and expenses of customASICs.  Furthermore, the flexible nature of in-systemprogrammable FPGAs meets the demands of an unsettled PCcard market, with its changing standards, fierce competition,and short product life cycles.  FPGA densities range fromabout 1000 to over 20,000 gates with larger devices coming. The CMOS technology of FPGA devices is inherently low-power.  One benefit of SRAM-based FPGA technology is itsability to be configured and reconfigured while resident in thetarget system.  This flexibility helps shorten developmenttimes and facilitates field upgrades.SRAM-based FPGAs make the PC Card more adaptable. Different FPGA configurations can be applied to the samehardware design; variations in the FPGA configurations, resultin different adaptations of the same card.  Allowing for thethickness of the circuit board and card enclosure leaves only1.2 and 2.0 mm for ICs on double-sided Type I and Type IIcards, respectively.  This imposes severe restrictions on theIC-package size, and has led to the adoption of TQFP andVQFP (very thin quad flat pack) packaging for FPGAs. TQFPs feature a package height of 1.6 mm, making themsuitable for single-sided Type I cards and single or double-sided Type 2 cards.  With 1.2-mm height, VQFPs can be usedon all single- or double-sided PCMCIA boards.  (Packageheight is defined as the distance from the surface of the boardto the top of the IC package, and is the sum of the packagethickness and its clearance off the board.)  For high-density,high-pin-count FPGA designs, Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs), justemerging, offer a nominal height of 2.0 mm, suiting them forPCMCIA designs.The U.S. semiconductor market is dominated bymicroprocessor and logic manufacturers, both standard logicand ASICs.

(Dallas, TX) was said to be evaluatingthe possibility of migrating to the next generations of X86processors, right now they are still dedicated to their decade-old 8086 and 286 product lines.  A spokesman said:  "We'vebeen making these parts for many, many years now, but we'reseeing demand increase to the point that we've had to go backin and re-allocate fab capacity, and we are investingsignificant money in new speed upgrades and package types." Including the processors and peripheral devices, such as timercircuits and direct-memory-access controller, Harris sold morethan 5 million of the 8086 and 286 devices in 1995.  Amongthe new package options Harris is adding to its 8086 and 286product lines, are surface-mount packages.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996INTEL SHIFTS TO PLASTIC PACKAGESSome years ago one of the pundits we talk to periodically saidthat packages of the future, despite what was being said then,would be eventually be plastic.  Intel went a long way towardconfirming that recently when it made some of  the biggestnews around by saying it will migrate the majority of itsmicroprocessor product line from ceramic to plastic packages. By moving to plastic, Intel will spend $29.50 less on eachmicroprocessor and be able to reduce the cost of the products. As much as 80% of Intel's microprocessors are now packagedin ceramic.  The move to plastic was made possible by thesuperb heat and power dissipation characteristics of Intel's0.35-micron process.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996OLE 2.0 AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN ECAD & MRP II Simple tools are the best tools.  Think of the extremelyqualitative work that can be done by an artist with simple paintand ordinary canvas.  When two or more pieces of softwarecan interact in a simple manner it opens a previously narrowgap by which the operators of the software can move data withpositive consideration for the task.  Consequently, anindividual can more easily motivate himself to take on a morearduous task.  This in turn helps the overall data streambetween the engineering department and the manufacturingand/or the administrative departments of a company.  OLEprovides this linkage and widens the gap.An engineering group can spend a significant amount of theirtime trying to get information and documentation about anassembly to manufacturing.  Perceptively, much of thisinformation is going to be entered into the company's MRPsoftware quickly and accurately.  OLE does this without anymanual intervention.  Therefore, an MRP system, having beendefined as an infinite planning system, can immediatelybreakout the materials required to start this project into motionwith rapid precision.  Now that the work orders and materialscan be generated, the aspect of more finite costing can beestablished.  With this information now assigned a  new role, itcan quickly generate purchase orders and work orders.A digital circuit board with 20 square inches of real estate caneasily have over 300 discrete parts.  They may not necessarilyall be different, but here must be a bill of materials and theywill all have different reference designators.  Coupled with allthe other information that is needed to define a circuit boardthere is a wealth of data needed to clearly define the project toother persons inside the company and out.  OLE keeps thisdata from having to be reproduced.  As in a referencedesignator chart of those 300 parts for hand placement, reworkor test.  When this data does not have to be retyped theengineering staff and the administrative staff can manage aproject more efficiently.  This in turn would benefit by thelowering the cost of not having to maintain multiple databases.  This allows purchasing and scheduling to utilize theMRP system much earlier in the design cycle.  Manufacturingcan now start to consider what the capacity constrainingresource is and the production path to be taken.When a single database can be maintained, the allowance formultiple individuals to access this information with theperception that it is accurate and updated frequently isgenerated.  This is the basis for a concurrent engineeringenvironment with minimal redundancy.  With all thishappening in rapid succession, the model of the product alsoneeds to be created, which is why OLE Design and Modelingis going to be an important factor for the MCAD group to keeppace with the ECAD systems.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996DESIGN TOOLS TARGET BGA AND PCB APPLICATIONSTwo new physical-design packages from Harris EDA (Fishers,NY) target ball-grid-array (BGA) and PC-board applications. The first product, Encore BGA, is aimed at single- and few-chip designs using BGA packaging technology.  Encore PCBis a physical design and layout environment for PC boards. Encore BGA was developed in partnership with AmkorElectronics, a leading packaging supplier.  Users can reducedesign time, improve manufacturability, and reducemanufacturing costs.  The tool includes automatic, optimizedwire-bound generation and no-net-list, all-angle, filleted tracerouting.Push-and-shove editing allows engineers to dynamically re-route traces on the substrate.  All-angle routing and advancedediting features ensure that all available space is used.  AndEncore BGA comes with a standard set of BGA design rules tomake the tool easy for first-time and casual users, while stillallowing for a high degree of user configurability if desired. Encore PCB lets users design, analyze, and optimize PC-boarddesigns.  User-specified design rules guide floorplanning,partitioning, and manual placement.  In addition, floorplanninglets users consider electrical constraints and manufacturabilityissues in the early design stages.Using a physical-synthesis option, users can automaticallyderive component placement and interconnect from CAE dataand user-specified constraints.  Partition synthesisautomatically optimizes component groups, partitions, andindividual component assignment.  Placement synthesisemploys placement algorithms that consider constraints suchas clearance rules, voids, and channels, while minimizingroute congestion and interconnect lengths.  Encore BGA andEncore PCB run on Unix platforms and work with leadingCAE design software, including products from Cadence,Mentor and Viewlogic.  Encore PCB also works with popularPC-based design systems.  Pricing starts at $25,000 for eachproduct.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996TITANIUM OXIDE FILM BINDS IC LAYERSA lightweight metal best known for its use in advanced aircraftstructures may provide the adhesive needed to hold togethergroups of integrated circuits in multichip modules -- and thelayers of material used to build high-speed circuits.  Multichipmodules will facilitate the miniaturization of computerequipment by allowing several chips to be placed in the samespace now needed for a single integrated circuit. To improvethe operating speed of the circuits and the new modules andallow use of smaller currents, electrical engineers would liketo use wiring patterns made from high-conductivity metalssuch as silver, gold or copper -- instead of standard aluminum.But those high-conductivity metals are usually difficult to usein circuits because other electronic materials -- silicon dioxideand polymers -- do not bond well to them.  Now, researchersat the Georgia Institute of Technology report that a thin film oftitanium oxide can serve as an intermediary layer to help bondfilms of high conductivity gold to the other materials used tobuild an integrated circuit.  The research is sponsored by theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)through the U.S. Air Force."This will allow us to think about replacing aluminum onintegrated circuits with a more conductive material such ascopper, gold or silver," explained Dr. Paul A. Kohl, professorof chemical engineering at Georgia Tech. "This process maybe of substantial value in integrated circuit and multichipmodule technology."Aluminum has long been used for wiring in integrated circuitsbecause it forms a stable insulating oxide to which otherelectronic materials readily bond. But metals like gold andsilver -- which are better conductors -- do not readily formstable oxides and therefore are more difficult to use in layeringthe circuits.Kohl and Graduate Student Kirkland W. Vogt believe theyhave solved that problem by depositing a thin film of titaniummetal on top of gold conducting films. The titanium adhereswell to the gold, and is then allowed to form an insulatingoxide (TiO2) on which the researchers can build layers ofsilicon dioxide or polymers."It's a simple one-step coating process that allows us to switchback and forth between insulators and metals at will withouthaving to worry about adhesion for each," explained Kohl. "Inour work with multichip modules, we use this exclusively toget adhesion. It's a kind of universal adhesion layer for us."Because it is thin, the titanium film does not alter the dielectricproperties of the insulator surrounding the metal. And becauseit does not significantly diffuse into the gold, conductivity isnot degraded.  Vogt analyzed the surface of the titanium layerwith help from Dr. Lawrence A. Bottomley in Georgia Tech'sSchool of Chemistry and Dr. Brent Carter in the School ofMaterials Science and Engineering. Using angle-resolvedX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunnelingmicroscopy (STM) and other techniques, he studied thecharacteristics of the titanium oxide film and found that itsthickness was critical to the success of the process.When deposited in layers of between three and 10 Angstromsthick on the gold film, the titanium forms "islands" whichoccupy about 90 percent of the surface -- but do not contactone another. Oxidation of the titanium metal creates acontinuous film of insulating titanium oxide, which builds upon top of the titanium islands and provides a bonding surfacefor the next layer of the circuit.  A core of titanium metalremains beneath the oxide to provide good adhesion to thegold.If the titanium layer is thinner than three Angstroms, oxidationdoes not leave enough titanium to ensure good adhesion, Vogtfound. If the layer is thicker than about 30 Angstroms, thetitanium islands grow together, forming a continuous metallayer that can become a conductor and short out the circuit. Multichip modules will allow the miniaturization of computercomponents by allowing several integrated circuits to beplaced into a single package in the space normally required forjust one circuit. "This can replace several packages of chips inside acomputer," Kohl explained. "All the interconnection isprovided on the base material, so you end up with a very densearray of circuits."Engineers would like to use the higher conductivity metals toincrease the speed of the circuits and to reduce the current theymust carry. Because the chips are closer together, the electronscarrying signals have less distance to travel; helping themtravel faster would give additional speed to the computingwork. Higher conductivity would also mean less current lossand less heat to remove from the circuit module.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996LASER MACHINING OF PCBS TO BE RESEARCHEDThe Technology Institute for Manufacturing Electronics(TIME)(Dayton, OH) has awarded a research contract todemonstrate the feasibility of laser machining of PCBmaterials.

Some of themajor outside factors that have helped shape that evolutionare:  1.  The shift from a military and mainframe dominatedmarket to a commercial product focus;  2.  The movement away from vertical integration and captivePCB shops to independent PCB fabricators and independentcontract assemblers;  3.  The slow but steady move from through-hole technologyto surface mount technology; and  4.  The rapidly increasing levels of density and integration onsemiconductor devices.From a technological standpoint, the basic processes usedtoday are the same that were used twenty years ago.  Clearlythere have been steady improvements in materials, proprietarychemicals, equipment and our understanding of PCBprocessing.  Nonetheless, there has been little change in howPCBs are processed today compared to twenty years ago. Layers are still imaged, etched and laminated.  Next comesdrilling, metalization, imaging, etch and finishing.It is clear that change will be needed in the future!  Thetransition from through-hole to surface mount technologyprovided an easy route to increased interconnection density. Replacing large holes that served a mechanical and electricalfunction with small connection vias freed up routing channels. Combined with enhanced dimensional stability of laminates,smaller line widths and spaces, stiff and accurate drillmachines, fine grained tungsten-carbide drills, and the abilityto scale artwork with raster-based laser photoplotters--largeimprovements have been made.  The result has been a five toten fold increase in interconnect density over the past twentyyears.  Nonetheless, the easy changes have been made. Further enhancements on the present methods of buildingPCBs will result in diminishing returns.  The industry is ripefor a change, but a change to what?Today it is obvious that the density improvements in the PCBfabrication industry are not keeping pace with those of thesemiconductor industry.  Semiconductors serve only anelectrical purpose.  Shrinking their geometries usuallyimproves the electrical properties and results in more die andmore revenue per wafer.  Printed circuit boards serve both anelectrical and a mechanical purpose that is difficult to separate. Frequently, the mechanical size is dictated by a form factor,making it impossible to shrink the overall board size, while atthe same time, the geometries decrease and the cost per squareinch increases.What is needed is a new PCB technology that allows very highconnection densities (where needed) without driving the costof the rest of the package out of sight!  Fortunately, there aremany new technologies that exhibit the potential for greatlyincreased interconnection densities.  Some of the mostpromising of these new processing methods and materials are:  1.  Photoimagable dielectrics,  2.  All organic dielectric materials in which vias can bechemically or reactive ion etched,  3.  Electrically conductive pastes for filling vias,  4.  Lasers that can simultaneously machine thousands of vias,and  5.  Lasers that can machine through copper.Most of these emerging technologies are squarely aimed atreducing the high cost of via formation when using small drillsfor conventional through-board via formation.  Secondarybenefits are that these processes allow the use of much smallervia pads; They only place vias between the required layer pairs(opening up routing channels on all other layers), and theyallow the use of optical alignment fiducials for improvedlayer-to-layer alignment, further reducing the required via padsize.The challenges facing the acceptance of any new PCBfabrication technology are:  1.  It must be producible on large panel sizes, i.e., 300-500sq. in.;  2.  It must provide reliability that is at least equal to existingsemiconductor packages;  3.  It must be compatible with existing semiconductorassembly and packaging processes; and  4.  Any increased processing and material costs must be lessthan the increased density on a per unit area.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996ELECTROLESS PALLADIUM: A SURFACE FINISH FOR INTERCONNECT TECHNOLOGYWith the continuous evolution of interconnect technology aseries of new demands on the  surface finish is emerging.  Theco-planarity of the surface finish is essential for paste printingaccuracy and placement on fine featured SMT devices.  Thefinish must be capable of withstanding multiple thermalexcursions in air without loss of solderability.  Preferably thesame finish is also compatible with wire bonding and contactswitching.  Electroless palladium over bare copper can meetthe above requirements.  It is  cost competitive andenvironmentally safe.  Electroless palladium eliminates the useof lead in the PCB manufacturing facility and is compatiblewith no-clean fluxes at the assembly end.Atotech developed a process that uses a novel reducing agentthat produces an electroless deposit of pure palladium that isfree of phosphorous or boron, eliminating variability in thedeposit and its solderability.  An electroless palladium coatingof 5-7 microinches (0.15 microns) over bare copper has excellent solderability preserving properties.  It is compatiblewith no clean fluxes after  multiple thermal excursions in air. At a thickness of 20-24 microinches (0.5- 0.6 microns) with agold flash (0.1 microns)  the finish is 100% gold wirebondable.Palladium has a density of 12gm/cm and a melting point of1552oC. Palladium is almost twice as hard as copper; it has ahardness of 250-290 Vickers as compared to copper at 150Vickers.  On the same scale gold is at 90 and nickel comes inat a hardness of 600 Vickers.  Palladium will not form a solidsolution in copper even with prolonged dwell at elevatedtemperatures (120 and 176o C for 48 hours).  The metal willstrip in molten solder at a rate of 0.02 microns per second at250 and 176o  C.  Copper at the same temperature has a striprate of 0.12 microns and gold is at 1.3 microns per sec.Atotech's process consists of four steps:    1.  Acid Clean;  2.  Microetch;  3.  Activate; and   4.  Electroless palladium.  The activator is highly selective to the copper surface. Theprocess uses the copper surface as a reducing agent for thedeposition of a thin layer (1.0 microinches) of immersionpalladium.  Activation depends on temperature and chemicalcomposition.  The system is buffered to the point that pHcontrol is not required.  A controller maintains the chemicalcomposition and doses the bath continuously during operation. The electroless bath will only deposit on a palladium metalsurface.  This surface is initiated in the activation step. Thedeposited metal then acts as the catalytic sight for sustainedplating.  This unique feature renders the bath totallyindependent of bath loading.  The thickness of the palladium is a function of dwell time beyond this point.  Of coursedeposition rate is dependant on temperature, chemicalcomposition and pH.  A controller maintains the chemistrywithin the specified range.  The bath is water clear, odorlessand very stable under operating conditions.  At the operating temperature and pH the bath is compatiblewith all the solder masks  tested to date.  The list includes thefollowing:  Probimer 52,62; Conformask 2000; Taiyo PSR400;Enthone 3241LG; Coates XZT15; Vacrel; Epic 200 andImagecure XV 501 TSM.  Multiple tests were conducted toevaluate the solderability of a thin electroless palladium finish. Thicknesses tested were 0.2 microns and 0.1 microns. Testconditions were steam aging, multiple IR thermal excursionsand baking.  Four different assembly fluxes were used  namelyAlpha 350(2%), Kester 951(2%), Kester 922(2%) and Alpha855(15%).  Soldermasks tested were; Probimer 52, Probimer71, Enthone 3241ALG and Taiyo 4000.  The finish with athickness as  low as 4.0 microinches (0.1 microns) survivedeight hours of steam aging. The resulting surface gave goodhole filling properties when assembled with a 2% no cleanflux in air.  No loss of solderablity was experienced after threeIR thermal excursions.  No loss of solderability was detectedafter 24 hours of dry bake at 160 and 176o C.  No clean fluxesin an air atmosphere were used in all applications.Boards coated with 0.7 microns of palladium were assembledusing standard reflow and wave procedures.  Cross sections ofthe joint were then prepared.  EDX was used to study theelemental composition at; the solder/copper interface, at 2microns and at 5 microns into the solder.  EDX analyses wereconducted on; the joint as formed, after baking and after 1000thermal cycles.  From the data it is evident that  anintermetallic phase between tin and palladium is set up as thejoint is formed.  This phase then migrates during temperinginto the solder away from the copper. This allows for  theformation of a copper/tin intermetallic at the copper surface.The palladium/tin phase forms a neutral solid solution in thesolder away from the copper interface.A palladium deposit 0.6-0.7 microns thick with immersiongold flash over bare copper was submitted for gold wire bondtesting.  Coupons with surface mount assembly sites wereused.  The coupons were split into two groups. One group wasassembled through reflow, using water soluble solder pastefollowed by aqueous cleaning.  The second group, a controlgroup, was processed as received.  A bead of die attach epoxywas placed around the bond site and was cured per vendorspecifications.  All assemblies were then plasma cleaned usingargon gas.A Hughes Aircraft wire bonder was used.  The bonderemployed a stage preheat.  The gold wire had a diameter of 1.0mil. Pull strengths were performed per MIL-STD-883B.  Theresults show that average pull strength was 8.4 gms with aS.D. of 0.46 for the control group and 8.2 gms for theassembled group with a S.D. of 0.43.  The brake perMIL-STD-883B had a Failure Location Code 1 (wire break atneck down point).  Additional testing is in progress toevaluate; alternate assembly equipment, palladium withoutgold flash and to optimize wire bonding parameters.  Contactswitch testing was conducted on a 0.2 microns palladiumdeposit over bare copper.  Initially 200,000 switches wereperformed at a pressure of 80 cN. This was followed by adwell in a humidity chamber for 4 days at 85 & 176o C and85% relative humidity.  An additional 400,000 switches werethen performed at the same pressure. No increase in resistivitywas recorded throughout the testing conditions.Under normal thermal stress both nickel/gold and palladiumdeposits showed no deterioration in resistivity . At increasedstress temperature of 155 and 176o C palladium shows nosignificant increase in resistivity for 28 hours.  Nickel/gold onthe other hand showed an increase of 300% after 16 hours. Under chemical stress conditions of 10 ppm H2S for 60 hoursno change was recorded for palladium. Nickel/gold exhibited a30% increase in resistivity.  For the palladium deposit to showthe same rise in resistivity it was necessary to increase theconcentration of the gas H2S to 100 ppm and the dwell time  to144 hours.Electroless palladium is an economical, environmentally safesurface finish. It does not require any modifications to existingassembly operations. The finish has great versatility and amultitude of applications.  As a diffusion barrier it may replaceelectrolytic nickel for gold tab electroplating applications. Can 25 microinches of electroless palladium replacenickel/gold tab plating and offer a final finish that issolderable, wire bondable and suitable for contact switching? How about electroless palladium on ceramic substrates? Electroless palladium offers answers to existing technologydemands and will be at the forefront to meet the challenges offuture technological advancements.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996PRECISION STENCILS FOR SMT ASSEMBLYA-Laser, Inc. (Beaverton, OR) announced a new serviceproviding laser cut stencils for the printing of solder paste oncircuit boards (PCBs) when using fine pitch surface mountcomponents.  The new service takes advantage of lasertechnology to manufacture stencils that improve SMTassembly yields by drastically reducing print errors.With fine pitch technology becoming more pervasive insurface mount designs the need for precision stencils isincreasing.  The component solder points for these fine pitchparts have become so small and closely aligned, A-Laser feels,that the accuracy needed cannot be met any longer bytraditional chemical stencil manufacturing technology.A-Laser uses a stencil laser system manufactured by LPKFCAD/CAM Systems that was specifically developed forstencil fabrication.  The laser system creates stencil apertureswith very clean, straight walls which allow printing of clean,precise solder paste islands.  High aperture positioningaccuracy (<15 m) combined with low inner wall roughness(<3  m) permit trouble-free fine-pitch PCB assembly, forpitches finer than 250  m (10 mil).Stencils are generated from common data formats such asGerber and HPGL.  The typical stencil is made of flat stainlesssteel, up to 60 x 80 cm (24" x 32"), in a range of thicknesses,typically from 50-250  m (2-10 mils).  Typical turnaroundtimes are three to five days and the cost starts at $275 perstencil without frame and about $400 per stencil with frame. First time customers receive a 50% discount on their first orderof a standard stencil.

(San Marcos, CA) has introduced its newTrayPro TP-12, a multiple-tray feeder for the PlacePro familyof surface mount assembly equipment.  The TrayPro TP-12 iscapable of handling up to 12 JEDEC trays on two platforms. A special feature of this tray feeder is that while the machineis picking a component from one platform, the other platformcan be re-loaded or re-configured by the operator, savingvaluable time.  The trays can be easily changed out, evenwhile the machine is in operation.  Utilizing a simplemechanical latching arrangement, the TrayPro TP-12 offers asolution to handling large numbers of tray-fed components. The TrayPro TP-12 takes full advantage of the PlacePro's four-head models allowing multiple, simultaneous pick-up ofmemory devices.  This efficient methodology means highproduction at an affordable cost-per-placement.  The TrayProTP-12 is especially effective for manufacturing memorymodules because multiple waffle trays of DRAMs can behandled very efficiently with the PlacePro machines.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996DIE-TECH INTRODUCES NEW SUBSTRATE HANDLING SYSTEMSDie-Tech, Inc. (York Haven, PA) has introduced a packagehandling system that transfers devices through multipleoperations without the operator having to handle them directly. The Model 6502 Substrate Handling system can process quadflat packs, DIPs, or SIPs in 12" long stainless steel "boat." Each boat holds multiple devices, the number depending uponthe size of the component.  There are 10 boats in eachmagazine.  The standard unit comes with a double magazine,and can be equipped with as many as four.  The basic systemincludes two vertical travel elevators, which lower the boatsonto the main track of the machine.  Once the substratescomplete the desired processes, the boats are then loaded backinto a magazine by means of the outgoing travel elevator. These magazines can then be transferred to other stations foradditional work, such as reflow, trim and form, testing,marking and inspection.  The system can also be used toautomate wire bonding, epoxy dispensing, paste dispensing,and component placement.  Pricing for a Model 6502Substrate Handling System, incorporated into a custom Die-Tech Model 4602 DIP machine with double magazine, boattransfer, lead attach and solder paste dispensing, isapproximately $250,000.1995 was a good year for manufacturers of screen printers forSMT.  Much of the highest growth in the market came fromcontract manufacturers.  End-users are looking for increasedperformance features that will make their screen printing moreautomatic to stepup throughput.

(Santa Ana, CA) and Koki  Company Ltd.   (Tokyo, Japan)announced the signing of a cross licensing agreement relating to the PrecisionPad Technology (PPT) solid  solder deposit  process.   Both Koki  and Mask Tekwill be opening PPT service bureaus in Tokyo and Santa Ana, in addition to theexisting Mask Technology PPT facility in Orlando, FL.  The patented technologyis claimed to improve fine pitch solderability by applying  a solid, reflowed,macro- planar solder deposit to SMT lands or pads.   The  solid solder depositformed is typically  0.002-inch to  0.010-inch, although  thinner deposits arenormally employed for TAB devices.  Mask Tek has been doing solder masking for nearly a decade and a half.  TheirPPT process grew out of this expertise.  They began obtaining patents for thePPT process four years ago.  Seven months ago, with their last patent in hand,they began to push the PPT process as a service.  Initially, the service wasoffered only in Orlando.  Now the Santa Ana site as well as the Tokyo sitealso offer the service.  What is eliminated by using the service is theprinting of solder paste.  Solder paste printing, like board fabrication, isordered by the end-user.  Generally, the entire board is processed, but it canbe just parts of the board, if there are certain hard to place components in aparticular area.When the processed board reaches the assembler or OEM a flux is applied to theboard, either by dispensing, stencil or spray.  Components are then place andthe board is reflowed.  Peel strength is increased with the PPT process, whileshorts and bridges are virtually eliminated.  The savings in rework, thecompany says, justifies the cost of the process.  The PPT cost is typically$0.05 per square inch of board, plus the cost of the stencil.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996WHO WHAT IN PLACEMENTNothing in market research is more vain than trying todetermine marketshare.  It's easy enough to figure out who arethe major competitors, harder by a great deal to determineexactly what share of the market these major competitorspossess.  In placement the task is even more daunting becausethe market itself can be segmented into three, maybe four,maybe five different categories, based on chip placementspeed (CPS) or cost.  With that caveat, we put forth our ideason this dubious area.  We will, over the course of time, refinethese numbers, both as the market shifts and as ourparticipation in the market deepens and allows us moreaccurate perceptions of what is really going on.  Now we mustrely on information that is probably hedged becausemarketshare figures are extremely vague unless based on unitsales, and few SMT placement manufacturers have arelationship with us, yet, that gives them the confidence torelease these figures.We include this information because we feel that majorplayers in the market are important, which is not to say minorplayers are not important.  But the research and productdevelopment at a major company is more likely to influencethe nature of the SMT market more than the research andproduct development at a minor company.  As always, we arelooking for answers for people actively involved in PCBassembly using surface mount components.  When, in themonths to come, we discuss work being done at Fuji orUniversal, it will be because we feel as if this work issomething that will benefit you.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996BGA BONDING UPGRADE KITThe new ball grid array (BGA) kit from Kulicke & SoffaIndustries (Willow Grove, PA) enhances the bondingcapability of the model 1488L turbo automatic gold ballbonder for handling ball grid arrays and other devices withlarge or varying height differentials.  The BGA kit enhancesmachine vision capability to focus more clearly on BGAs, formore accurate and reliable bond placement.  BGA devicestypically have large die/lead height differentials, ranging from0.41 to 0.56 mm.  By expanding machine vision range to 0.76mm, the kit provides bonders with a sharper visual image ofBGAs, for clearer bond position targeting.  Stationary opticseliminate the need for operator adjustments; focusing isperformed with out time-consuming mechanical motion,maximizing UPH.  A loop trajectory also improves secondbond angle approach for reduced risk of contact withground/supply pads.  Greater loop control allows accurateplacement of second bonds in multiple rows for effective finepitch.  A new algorithm minimizes wire sweep and reduces therisk of wires shorting when molding for higher yields.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996SOLDERING EQUIPMENTThe U.S. market for soldering ovens, we feel, is going tocontinue to be very healthy through the year 2000.  Newpackage types will keep end-users looking for good ovens.  Inaddition, included in the category are curing ovens which willfind better acceptance during the next few years as the marketfor conductive adhesives grows.

Solderless flip chip technology involves the deposition of ascreen-printable dielectric polymer onto the silicon chip in wafer form,leaving the metallized bond pads open.  This process, called advanced waferpassivation (AWP), utilizes high precision, automatic screen printers withpattern recognition alignment.  The printer must be able to print the micronrange with acceptable resolution and repeatability.  After the dielectric iscured, an electrically conductive polymer is stenciled onto the bond pads ofeach chip on the wafer to form the interconnect bumps.A 25 micron layer of dielectric polymer is stencil printed over the entiresurface of the wafer, excluding bond pads and streets.  A printer with visionalignment is required because the bond pad size is typically 100 micronssquare and the spacing between adjacent bond pads is usually 200 microns.  Inthe second step of the process, the conductive bumps are formed.  Alaser-etched stencil, with the bond pad array etched open, is aligned to thewafer bond pads.  The bump height is 50 microns (+/-3 microns).  Theconductive bumps are then cured in an infrared furnace with a nitrogenatmosphere after which they are ready for assembly. A thin layer (0.001") of conductive adhesive is stenciled onto the bond padsof the substrate.  A high precision printer employing a metal stencil ismandatory so that interconnect height, volume and diameter can be accuratelycontrolled.  The flip chip is then aligned and amounted onto the substrateusing a flip chip aligner/bonder.  The bumps of the flip chip are contacted tothe wet adhesive on the metallized substrate pads and 30 to 40 gms istypically used to adhere the flip chip to the substrate.  A 300X magnificationon the aligner/bonder is used to ensure accurate alignment of the bumps to thesubstrate.  This is essential because conductive adhesives do not have theself-aligning properties exhibited by solder.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996SMT INSPECTIONInspection is an increasingly important part of the entire PCBprocessing when surface mount components are involved. Inspection equipment can be one of the most ubiquitous piecesof equipment on the line.  Inspection equipment can be foundat the head of the line for incoming inspection of both printedcircuit boards and components, after solder paste screenprinting, after component placement, after reflow soldering,and after cleaning.An order of magnitudes' escalation in the cost of finding andcorrecting a defect at each successive stage in the productionof an electronics system should turn a manufacturingmanager's thoughts to finding defective boards andcomponents early.  Checking for manufacturing defects incircuit fabrication and assembly must await performance of thephysical process at issue.  Many component defects, however,can be found at incoming inspection, when the componentsenter the manufacturer's facility.Probably the most important function of incoming partsinspection is the detection of oxidation of the PWB traces. This is because the boards are exposed most often tocontaminants such as moisture and body oils.  They arefrequently shipped and stored without the packagingprecautions used for paste and components.  Components areusually received in containers that prevent contaminationcaused by handling or atmospheric exposure.  Solder pastemay be refrigerated and kept in sealed containers for usewithin a few weeks after receipt.  Boards, however, may bekept in inventory for several months.  Therefore, inspection foroxidation should occur not only upon receiving them but alsobefore the boards enter the assembly process.Inspection of the application of solder paste is the first step inensuring a good solder joint.  After printing solder paste ontothe pads, the process may require inspection of the wet solderbefore components are placed.  This level of inspectionensures that the correct amount of paste is located on the padswithin acceptable tolerances.  The kinds of problemsassociated with faulty paste printing include solder bridging,excessive print deposition, and whether the print registration isoff.  Insufficient solder paste can result in opens.  Unlevelprinting can lead to downline process problems such asskewing or tombstoning.  Boards not printed to spec can beremoved from the line before there is any more value added. Equally important, the cause of the fault is identified socorrective action can be taken.After components are placed on the board, the assemblyshould be inspected for correct component positionaltolerances including pattern error correction (PEC), leadinspection, coplanarity inspection, and part-to-pad matching. Because of the greater density of these circuits, placement ismuch more critical than with through-hole components.The solder joint inspection process can be broken down intotwo categories:  1.  Pre-solder inspection; and  2.  Post-solder inspection.The objective of post-assembly, pre-solder inspection is to findand replace wrong, misoriented, misplaced, and missing partsat the most cost-effective point in the process.  The objectiveof post-solder inspection is to assure sound solder jointsbetween component leads and pads on assembled PCBs. Some common defects occur after the components have beensoldered to the board.  Solder balls may form if boards are notproperly prepared or if paste is improperly applied.  The defectis more common to vapor phase soldered boards.  Dewettingor missing solder are easy to detect visually.  Solder bridgesand cracks are difficult to spot if they occur beneath acomponent.Defects occur which may not affect the performance of theproduct immediately but which may degrade the long-termreliability of the circuit.  Flux residues may cause corrosion orthe failure of a conformal coating.  Voids or pinholes may becaused by gases formed during reflow or by flux which hasfailed to escape from the solder before it hardens.  These willrarely impede the functioning of the circuit but may affect itslong-term reliability, especially if the assembly is subjected tovibration.Included in the SMT inspection equipment market areautomatic and manual inspection equipment.  Manual systems,which generally involve a microscope, perhaps with 3Dcapability and a video camera and monitor, are most oftenfound at the end of the process line, where they are used toinspect fully assembled PCBs.  A manual system necessarilyinvolves a technician whose judgement is used to evaluate thequality of the board.  Manual systems are still very much inuse not only because of their lower cost but also, with well-trained operators, they are very good systems for providingassemblers with go or no-go judgements about boards.  Automated systems include x-ray, laser, and automated opticalsystems.  They involve "golden" board models which are usedto automatically compare boards being processed.  Automatedsystems can be found throughout the process line.  Althoughautomated systems are used widely, because of their ability tomonitor boards during several phases of processing, they areanything but perfect, and they are often very expensive.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996BEYOND CFCLast summer when we visited EMPF (Indianapolis, IN), one ofthe bits of information we picked up was how manycompanies were unaware of the Montreal agreement that leadto the phasing out of CFC use in PCB cleaning.  The fact is,we feel, that companies are trying to hold onto their CFCcleaners as long as possible, and, in many cases, until someonecomes along and tells them to stop using them, they're going tocontinue as in the past.  The difference, they are going to find,is that they will have to recycle the cleaners that they do have,that no new CFC will be on the market.  In addition, of course,manufacturers of CFC-based cleaning systems have stoppedmaking those types of equipment and the market has graduallymoved toward other types of equipment.  There are, however,other types of solvents that are being used and therefore themarket for solvent cleaners remains.  How long it will remaindepends on how good aqueous cleaners become and howeffective no-clean, fluxless solders become.

The ever smaller dimensions on integrated circuits havecreated a demand for new and improved techniques ofmeasurement and their related standards, especially as featuresizes approach and become smaller than the wavelength oflight used in conventional optical metrology instruments. Thedimensions of present interest range from about 0.5micrometers to 30 micrometers and will extend to smallerdimensions in the future. A series of three line width/pitchStandard Reference Materials for photomasks is presently inproduction. Research is in progress to develop new andimproved standards for use in instruments utilizing optical orscanning electron microscopy. Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996IRDAS DETECTS DEFECTSTest- and quality-oriented engineering research suggests that aunit under test can be compared to a "golden board" to identifydefective components.  When used in conjunction withelectronic test, this method can reduce the time fortroubleshooting and repairing a circuit.  But it does not addressother issues such as early lifetime component failure, poorheat sinking or cold solder joints unless thermal output issignificantly different.At the same time, simple comparison also highlights smallrandom variations in thermal output resulting from normalproduction variations.  As a result, a test person has to makevalue judgments to differentiate "acceptable" trouble spotsfrom real ones.Motorola Information systems Group (ISG) in Mansfield, MA,decided to develop a system that could detect circuit boardsthat run outside an acceptable temperature threshold despitepassing traditional electronic test methods.  It also wanted asystem that would account for normal variations in thermaloutput and thus eliminate arbitrary personal judgment from theassessment process.  To do this, Motorola built a "model boardimage" from the statistical mean of the thermal intensityimages of a large number of boards rather than the image of agolden board.The system, called IRDAS, for infrared defect analysis system,comprises an IR camera interfaced to a UNIX workstation(SUN Sparc 10/50 with Ethernet interface).  It uses GeneralImaging Corp.'s software based upon that company'sProtoPIPE Object-Oriented Grahical ProgrammingEnvironment.  The high-performance IR camera andsophisticated signal/image-processing software have made thistechnology available for the factory floor.Motorola ISG tested the IRDAS system by developing meanintensity images for each product type.  The IRDAS systeminterfaces a fixture holding the test assemblies to the cameraand powers the assembly to ensure that images are captured atprecise times for analysis.  Three LEDs in the fixture shinethrough tooling holes in the circuit to register the board imagesduring analysis.The system imaged 30 electrically proven assemblies andincorporated each pixel into a composite image of this mean-intensity model for average operational boards.  Then designdata for a particular assembly was downloaded into the systemto create an overlay of components specific to the assemblybeing tested.  The LED alignment positions, the templateimages for each image time (10, 20, and 30 s) and CAD datawere used to create a test-control file specific to the circuitassembly being tested.To test boards from the factory, a baseline thermal referenceimage was taken prior to automatic power-up and then theboards were imaged in the factory-run mode.  The baselinewas subtracted from each image to eliminate random thermalfluctuations.  The system compared the images taken at eachtime to the template for that time, calculated any differences inthermal intensity and determined statistical significance.  Thesystem "passed" the assembly if no excessively hot or coldcomponents were found.  In a "failed" unit, cold areas weredisplayed blue and hot areas red.According to Motorola, analysis shows that IRDAS detectsnonfunctional components by identifying the absence ofthermal output resulting from open circuits or excessiveoutputs resulting from shorts, damage or misaligned parts. The company is currently trying to determine the limits ofdetectability including out-of-specification resistances,parametric shifts in output and other faults.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996NO-CLEAN FLUX CREATES BOARD-PROBING PROBLEMSEnvironmental agencies are prohibiting the use ofchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) because it's commonly believedthat they affect the ozone layer.  Since traditional circuit boardassembly processes relied heavily on CFCs as solder fluxsolvents, a replacement process was desperately needed.  Onealternative to cleaning PCBs with solvents is the use of no-clean fluxes.  While no-clean solder flux solves theenvironmental problem, it creates a new problem for testfixturing, because it leaves a thick layer of residue on the unitunder test (UUT).  Although this "benign" residue will notaffect how the UUT operates, many test probes have troublepenetrating it; also, nonconductive solids in the residue can actas insulators and keep test probes from making a goodelectrical contact.  There are various techniques  you can useto alleviate this headache.Standard test-fixture probes frequently cannot performadequately on a UUT coated with flux residue, so probemanufacturers have developed new models that work in theno-clean flux environment.  Single-needle probes can usuallypenetrate the flux, and they are a popular choice for manyapplications.  But the probe tips need to be replacedfrequently.  Even though the normal tip material--berylliumcopper--is a hard material, the tips still wear down prematurelybecause of the high forces used to break through the flux.  Analternate tip material is steel:  It is nearly twice as hard asberyllium copper and, hence, lasts up to twice as long.  Single-needle probes are ideal for solder-filled holes or pads, but ifyou try using them for through-hole applications, you will getslipping and side loading, which lead to inconsistent resultsand bent tips.  For through-hole applications, you'll find tri-needle, crown-shaped, or aggressive multifaceted tips to bemore appropriate.  Some probe manufacturers recommendusing rotating probes.  With these probes, the tip rotates(usually 90 degrees) upon contact with the UUT, drillingthrough contamination and making a good electricalconnection.  One obvious problem with this aggressivesolution is that it can damage the UUT; another problem is thatthe debris produced by probe operation can clog the rotationmechanism and disable it, so increased maintenance isrequired.In addition to selecting the optimum tip, you'll also need toselect the right probe spring pressure.  The normal range ofpressure, usually between 4 oz and 8 oz, may not be highenough to penetrate the layer of residue.  You may need toexperiment with forces of 10 oz or greater.  Increased probepressure requires increased upward force on the UUT, whichmay create vacuum leak problems.  Here are a few ways toprevent leaks:  1.  Use a high-capacity vacuum pump.  A minimum of 25 in.of Hg and 40 CFM is suggested.  Use a dedicated vacuumpump for each test area.  2.  Vacuum volume can be just as important as vacuumpressure.  Try to use a 10-15 gallon vacuum surge tank foreach test fixture.  This can improve test performance andreliability by providing faster fixture actuation, which causesboth a better initial seal and a better electrical contact.  3.  For maximum efficiency, avoid any plumbing restrictions. All pipes and hoses should be the largest practical size, andvalves and fittings should have the same inside dimensions asthe pipes, if possible.Ideally, vacuum alone is all you need to actuate the fixture andhold the UUT inplace.  If you use many high-force probes,though, vacuum alone will not do the job, and the UUT maybecome deformed or even become damaged because ofunbalanced forces.  To prevent such damage, you must use atype of overclamp or hold-down gate.  The simplest solutionuses pressure fingers to hold the UUT firmly on the fixture andto compensate for uneven test probe pressures.  Sometimes,you'll need to isolate all or part of the UUT from the vacuum,such as when there are open vias (multilayer feedthroughconnections) or large holes on the board.  Isolating open viasand large holes minimizes contamination of the vacuumsystem by flux residues, but it also exacerbates the uneven testprobe pressure problem, since the vacuum forces are notpresent to counteract probe forces.  The probe plate coulddeflect if the pressure is excessive; you may need to use athicker plate to reduce deflection.  Stress analysis candetermine which fixture components need strengthening. Loaded board lids, or vacuum boxes, are becoming morecommon; these eliminate the vacuum isolation required whenusing oveclamps but do not allow access to the UUT.  Aconcentration of high-pressure probes without counterforcefrom pressure fingers can distort the UUT, possibly causingtrace fractures or causing surface mount devices to pop off. Try to distribute probes evenly, but if you can't, allow spaceon the top of the UUT above dense probe areas for pressurefingers.  Work with the board designer to ensure that there isspace left for the pressure fingers.The no-clean flux process generates much more residue thanconventional wave soldering, so new preventativemaintenance standards are needed to reduce downtime.  Nosingle maintenance schedule will work for all test fixtures.  Ifyou think your test conditions are not too severe, start bycleaning or replacing probes every 25,000 cycles.  Fixturesshould be cleaned and seals and gaskets serviced every 20,000cycles.  Be sure to inspect everything more frequently than20,000 cycles, though, and adjust the replacement interval asneeded; some probes may need replacement after only 3000cycles.  Try to minimize the impact of no-clean flux on testingby fine-tuning the soldering process:  allow the board moretime to be heated; control solder paste application; raise thetemperature slightly during reflow; monitor the results; andadjust all aspects of the process as required to minimizeresidue on the test pads.  If possible, work with the designer toensure that:  1.  Vias are not left open and the number and size of holesare minimized; by attending to these details, you'll preventproblems with vacuum leaks and eliminate the need for specialtest probe tips;  2.  Test points are evenly distributed over the UUT ifpossible, especially on high-density boards;  3.  The target pads for test probes are big enough to beaccessed repeatedly without special fixturing; and  4.  There is adequate space for pressure fingers when they areneeded.You should also work with the fabrication and inspectiongroups so they know what types of errors to watch out for. You don't want to suddenly have a test point with nocontinuity because of an undersized pad or an inaccuratelydrilled hole.  Remember that the source of a testing problem isoften somewhere back up the production line.  With properdesign and fabrication, production problems can beminimized.  There is no magic solution to test fixturing in ano-clean flux environment.  The more you control a board'sdesign and manufacturing processes, the easier it will be todesign a fixture and perform a proper test; you'll uncover morereal failures and have fewer false failures due to fixturinig andprobing problems.  After years of fighting to get engineers todesign testable products, test engineers finally saw progress: designers began to design boards with enough space betweentest points to allow easy and effective board probing.  Now,the need to make circuits even smaller is causing testengineers new problems.  But with proper planning, you canease the way you test assemblies that use a dense array ofsmall devices with fine-pitch leads.Not only are designers shrinking the size of components, butthey are also increasing the number of pins on eachcomponent.  As a result, lead pitches, or the distances betweenleads, are becoming finer than ever.  The definition of "finepitch" depends on whom you ask.  Some engineers define"fine pitch" as spacings of less than 0.040 in.  You can evenfind some IC packages with lead pitches of only 0.010 in! When circuit leads are that close, it is difficult to build a robusttest fixture.  Nevertheless, there are several ways you can helpa product-development team improve the testability ofassemblies that incorporate fine-pitch components:  1.  Encourage your designers to add boundary-scancapabilities that will aid interconnect testing.  Boundary-scantesting was developed to address the problem of circuitdensity.  Testing the interconnects of an assembly withboundary scan requires access to only four test points.  Forboundary scan to be effective, it must be designed into an IC. Look for off-the-shelf ICs that have boundary-scan capability,and ask your designer to put boundary-scan circuits in customICs.  Fortunately, most EDA vendors provide tools that letdesigners insert boundary-scan circuits into custom designs. You also need a modern ATE that can drive boundary-scanchains and evaluate test results.  ATE vendors supply test-development tools that automate the test-programdevelopment.  2.  Make sure to set the design rules properly in your printed-circuit board (PCB) layout program.  Most layout programs letyou set design rules and check for rule violations once thedesign is complete.  Be sure the settings match the types oftesting you plan to do.  3.  Add test points that you can probe.  In general, test pointsshould be in centers that are at least 0.020 in. apart, and thefarther apart you can place them, the better.  Adding test pointslets you better probe a printed-circuit board, but it also mayincrease the size of the board or reduce the density of thecircuitry o the board.   4.  Pay special attention to fixture design and probe selection. Some newer probes let you probe test points on 0.010 in.centers.  You must, however, handle these probes verycarefully, and you must design and build the fixture so theprobes can maintain their probe-pointing accuracy.  Tomaintain the point accuracy, drill the probe's mounting holesin a very accurate and straight manner.  Other factors thatcontribute to pointing accuracy include straightness of theplunger, clearance between the probe and the barrel, retainedlength of the plunger, and extended length of the plunger.  5.  Send assemblies directly from manufacturing to functionaltest, shipping the manufacturing defect test stages.  Thedisadvantage of using this approach is that you will have torely on your functional test to find manufacturing defects.  Ifyou select this approach, you should analyze failures carefully. When a manufacturing defect causes a failure, quickly sendthe failure information back to the manufacturing engineers.  6.  Use moving-probe testers to probe circuits that you can'ttest with fixed-probe fixtures.  Moving-probe test systems areoften the solution of last resort, because they can be expensive,and they don't test points as rapidly as a fixture with 100 testpoints can.  Models are available that let you probe test pointsas small as 0.002 in.

Ed Zambrowski told us thatthe BGA-200, which has a base price on the unit was $11,000,is like having a small reflow oven at your fingertips.  Thesystem has been engineered to allow safe, efficient rework ofBGA components.  Utilizing a microprocessor profilecontroller, the operator simply selects the appropriate removalor replacement profile and starts the rework sequence. Removal and replacement profiles can be stored, recalled andedited with the touch of a button, or to guarantee processcontrol, the profiles can be locked to eliminate operateadjustment.  The BGA-2000's exclusive Micro Oven designencapsulates the BGA being reworked ensuring that a constanttemperature controlled environment is maintained throughoutthe reflow cycle.  The Micro Oven's proprietary PCB sealcombined with its elevated nozzle vents protect surroundingcomponents from adjacent heating damage normallyassociated with non-focused convection heating devices.  TheBGA-2000's exclusive dual path heater module, bypasses theheater chamber during cool-down ensuring a controlled, rapidcool-down protecting solder ball integrity.The closed loop temperature control feed back systemmaintains the Micro Oven temperatures at +/-5o C, protectingdelicate components and ensuring accurate reflow processcontrol.  The BGA-200 offers 2 modes of operation:  1.  Removal--with 5 pre-programmed removal heatingprofiles; and  2.  Placement--with 15 pre-programmed reflow profiles.The BGA-2000 provides four temperature controlled zones ineach profile:  1.  Subzone/Pre-heat;  2.  Soak;  3.  Peak; and  4.  Cool-down.Each of the profiles parameters (time/temperature) is digitallydisplayed on the BGA-2000's front panel.  Operators can storean additional 25 removal and 55 replacement profiles in theBGA-2000's on-board profile storage locations.  An optionalRS-232 interface allows the operator to display, edit, monitorand run profiles on the BGA-2000 directly from a PC.  Anadditional thermocouple input is provided for remotemonitoring (i.e., under the component for profile set-up), andis displayed on the BGA-2000 front panel or on the PCthrough the RS-232 interface.  In addition to BGAs the BGA-2000 can also rework QFPs, PLCCs and many other SMTcomponents, utilizing the full range of FCR SMT nozzles.  Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996ASIAN MARKET STILL GOODThe Asian market for SMT repair equipment has always beendifferent than the U.S. market.  Here boards, destined formilitary or aerospace applications, for example, wereexpensive and repair a necessity.  Asian manufacturers wereinterested in boards destined for consumer electronics.  Theyworked very hard to get their lines running as efficiently aspossible and when mistakes were made, the boards weresimply discarded.  The Asian market was, traditionally,dominated by the Japanese.  When the Japanese marketslowed down, the market for SMT equipment generallyslowed down too, except that at about the same time theJapanese market was slowing down, the Korean market, inparticular, was heating up.In terms of the attitude of Asian manufacturers toward SMTrepair equipment, we found in talking to SMT repairequipment manufacturers that the nature of the market wasstill about the same.  These are still high volumemanufacturers and they spend less time repair boards than U.S.manufacturers do, except that with an increase in the use ofsome advanced packages, such as multichip modules andBGAs, there is a slight improvement in the amount of repairwork being done.  The more significant change in the marketis, though, geographical.  Whereas the Japanese marketdominated the area tremendously five years ago, now theKorean market, particularly, is very good, along with themarket in Taiwan and Singapore.Additionally, with the growth of Asian markets outside Japan,there has been a great deal of prototyping work which hasdrawn in a lot of rework equipment from the United States. Altogether U.S. manufacturers were finding the Asian marketas good as it ever was or much better.  One company saw theirequipment being bought in part as a means to helpmanufacturers improve their processing lines rather than justto repair boards.  When problems began occurring, boardscould be examined with the rework station and the cause of theproblem determined.  Sales in Asia often came through Asianreps although some sales to Asia originated in the UnitedStates with U.S. companies that have manufacturing facilitiesin Asia, particularly in Singapore.While the trend toward automation was evident to mostmanufacturers, there was the feeling that much of the marketwas still interested in semiautomatic and manual equipment. Machines designed for BGA work were the ones that got thecompany's name in the trade journals, but customers weremostly interested in equipment that allowed them to quicklyremove and replace SOICs and other less glamorouscomponents.  But the market for BGA repair equipment isdefinitely here and growing.  Sales are coming from largermanufacturers right now, since these are the companies usingBGA packages the most.  As much as 20% of the largermanufacturers are probably buying BGAs and repairequipment for PCBs with BGAs.  By the end of the years,however, the market for BGA repair equipment, it's felt, willhave spread to larger contract manufacturers.

(Key Largo, FL) is another system designed for BGArework.  Jim Dornan told us the unit was developed for work at Motorola andwas sold as part of Metcal's line.  The unit sells for $3,800 and provides asingle station BGA and SMT repair solution.  The Chipmaster organizes therework environment while addressing the problems of BGA and SMT componentrepair, by providing better process control and less maintenance.  With theChipmaster, the replacement consumables are limited to a simple vacuum cup.The Chipmaster X-Y table dictates and creates the reflow and placementtopography and becomes the "engine" which drives the bench allowing anergonomic arrangement of bench management.  With the Chipmaster being the onlytrue BGA machine designed for Motorola at an equipped price of $3,800, itrepresents a sensible cost effective answer to tomorrow's components today.Back to Headline List CopyrightSMT TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 1996METCAL OFFERS TO CUSTOMIZE TIPS The Metcal (Menlo Park, CA) Custom Talon Tip Program ensures that Talonusers can get custom tips in a fraction of the time of a normal custom tipprogram or production release.

There is nominimum order for custom tips; however, it order to achieve time and costgoals, certain limitations have been placed on the program in terms ofguidelines.  For example, tips must meet certain dimensional requirements,must be for 2-sided component removal only, and be in the 500 and 600 seriestemperature ranges.  Other requirements and restrictions apply.  Custom tipswhich fall outside the shape, temperature range, or other guidelines can beaccommodate, but not as part of the program.Back to Headline List WT03-B08-28IA087-000629-B018-293http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/ml18.html 205.156.212.5 19970122034454 text/html 93226HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 03:42:34 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:46 GMTContent-length: 93039Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ml18.html Sample Issue Copyright COMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNet January-March 1995 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES COMMENTARY . . .

We applaud the NIST Advanced Technology Program (see Page Three) forthat reason.  Take for example the program awarded to the team led by DuPontto develop composites manufacturing for large structures for civilinfrastructure applications.  This effort will be largely directed toconstruction and retrofit of bridge structures -- an area of great need.The approach will be to use an embryonic technology involving resininfusion, with the prospect of reducing costs by at least 30% whileproducing high-quality structures.  Further, according to J. Michael Bowman,DuPont V.P., the plan is to reduce time to market by at least 50%.  Thiswill be accomplished by concurrently developing and validating theprocessing technology and rapidly deploying it to large commercialstructures.     Another good example of innovation and willingness to take risk is therecent award of a $750,000 contract to Textron Specialty Materials by theDept. of Energy.  TSM will develop and fabricate "in a cost-effectivemanner," high-strength hot-gas filters with "greatly enhanced durability."The approach is to modify TSM's continuous fiber-reinforced ceramiccomposite (nitride-bonded SiC).  The goal:  the next generation of hot-gasfilters for use in combustors and power-generation systems.     NIST and Dept. of Energy, as well as the contractors involved, deserveour praise. (As one reader observed, we might contrast these efforts withthe limited commitment to composites made by ARPA in its TRP program;  seeVol. 10, No. 4, Page Two.)                                        -- George Epstein, EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995NACFAM OBSERVATIONS ABOUT TRP . . .     The National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing (NACFAM), anon-profit, non-partisan association of companies, technology centers, tradeassociations, and technical education associations, seeks to raise the U.S.industrial base to world-class levels of productivity, quality, andcompetitiveness.  As such, it was a strong supporter of the legislation thatcreated the Technology Reinvestment  Project  (TRP).     In its analysis of the TRP program to date, NACFAM addressed thesuccesses and failures.  "The awards have gone to a series of worthyprojects. . . .  However, experience in the first year of the "RP has alsopointed to some problem areas that need to be worked out."  These includethe need to revise the costly proposal writing process;  acceleration of thecontracting process;  and broader participation by small business. -- Weagree, and hope that ARPA  takes these observations seriously, recognizingthat this constructive criticism is meant to make the TRP a more valuableprogram for the U.S.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995RUSSIA:  QUITE ADVANCED IN COMPOSITES TECHNOLOGY     In connection with McDonnell Douglas Aerospace's agreement with theRussian Central Research Institute, Ken Drake of The Aerospace Corp. had theopportunity to view some composite structures developed in Russia, includinga 4-ft. diam. interstage adapter.

Accordingto Mohsen Sultan, Chief of the New Technology Management Branch at Caltrans,Division of Structures (P.O. Box 942874, Sacramento, CA  94274;  phone:916/227-8247), the primary focus will be seismic retrofit  and methods forstrengthening bridge structures. The program is planned as a cooperativepartnering effort between Caltrans and the industry, with likelyparticipation from other government agencies.     Among the approximately 100 people in attendance were representativesof the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Univ. of Calif. at SanDiego (UCSD is a key participant in the ARPA and FHWA bridge programs),aerospace companies, SPI/CI, SACMA, as well as both U.S. and foreigncompanies (Japan and Canada). Sultan made it clear that foreignparticipation will be welcomed as long as it contributes to the success ofthe program.     Jim Roberts, Director of the Caltrans Engineering Service Center, notedthat Caltrans has had several limited studies underway on seismicretrofitting, which suggest the potential of composite wrapping aroundconcrete columns.  This new program is intended to develop a genericspecification  reflecting the need to replicate the design and process inthe field and performed under field conditions;  it will establish designguidelines and ensure repeatability and consistency.  The approach is toapply composite material around concrete bridge columns to providerestraint, thereby confining the column so it won't explode under load.Composite wrapping will be competing with the current approach which usesheavy steel jacketing.  (Steel jackets are now being installed as part ofthe seismic strengthening program in California.  However, installation isdifficult and costly.  Sections are welded together, resulting in jointsthat are difficult to inspect and are subject to corrosion.)     There are a number of issues that must be addressed in establishing thespecification for seismic retrofit/rehabilitation:  materials selection,processing, and design;  standardized testing methods to verify performance;quality control/assurance;  and system performance criteria -- to ensurelong-term durability and performance under all environmental highwayconditions. The program  also will develop data as well as design guidelinesthat can be applied on a nation-wide basis.  Caltrans expects the program toserve as a "springboard" for other applications of composites in highwayconstruction.      According to Ray  Zelinski, Chief, Seismic Technology, Bay BridgeDesign Group, there are about 4500 state and local bridges that requireretrofit;  it is hoped to complete the task in about five years.  He seesthis program as providing means for bridge repair.  Every earthquake leavessome bridge structures in need of "quick repair," he said.  Other statesalso have need for bridge strengthening.  In addition to bridge columns,there is need for strengthening of superstructures, for which compositesmight be applied.     Caltrans plans to have the USAF Advanced Composites Program Office atMcClellan Air Force Base, and The Aerospace Corp. (El Segundo, CA) as keymembers of the government team.  In addition, Caltrans is establishingacademic and engineering consultants advisory panels.     %   Industry presentations were made by a number of organizations.  Dr.Gil Hegemier of UCSD described his team's related efforts and offered tomake the information available for the Caltrans program.  Japanese companieshave made a sizable investment and are already applying composites inbuilding and highway construction, although to date only a little work hasbeen done in retrofit of bridge columns.  Representatives of several foreigncompanies discussed their capabilities and experience -- including Bayex ofCanada;  and Mitsubishi Chemical, Obayashi Corp., and Sumitomo Corp. ofJapan.     Ed Fyfe,  president of Hexcel-Fyfe, reviewed his company's efforts  inwrapping of bridge columns.   He noted that wrapped columns had been testedat the Univ. of Calif., San Diego laboratory, demonstrating theireffectiveness in improving the ductility of the concrete.  A number ofbridge columns, he said, are already in operation in California.  Severalmaterials manufacturers and prepreggers briefly described their companies'products that might be useful in these applications.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995NHTSA ACTION WILL IMPACT USE OF CARBON/EPOXY  NGV TANKS     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the Dept.of Transportation (DOT) is planning to increase the burst safety factor forcarbon fiber-reinforced composite tanks.  These tanks are being used forstorage of compressed natural gas for natural gas vehicles (NGV).     In March, NHTSA plans to issue Standard 304, Compressed Natural GasContainers, which will require a burst safety factor of 3.33;  whereas thecurrently accepted ANSI/AGA NGV2 standard and ISO/TC 58 SC 3/WG 17 draftedin 1993 specify a value of 2.25.  This increase would result in substantialweight and cost increase -- possibly forcing carbon fiber composite tanksout of the market for NGVs in the U.S., according to Peter Plate, No.American Sales & Marketing Manager, EDO Canada Ltd. (1940 Centre Ave., N.E.,Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2E 0A7;  phone:  800/361-8265), one of the majormanufacturers of such tanks.  He stated that  weight savings through thesuccessful certification of these tanks has "opened new markets for NGVs,particularly buses and lightweight passenger cars, which had previously beenhampered by the excessive weight of metal and fiberglass tanks."  (Note:The EDO tanks use a seamless thermoplastic liner, over which the carbonfiber/epoxy composite is filament-wound.)     The burst factor of 2.25 was developed by the NGV industry working withthe American Gas Association, and approved by the American StandardsInstitute. Tests are required to verify ability to withstand severe impact,damage (cuts), puncture by gunfire, extreme temperatures, exposure tocorrosive gas contaminants, exposure to fire, and repeated pressure fills.Acceptance of the 2.25 burst factor is supported by a number oforganizations, including the Federal Transit Administration, the Dept. ofEnergy, the Calif. Highway Patrol, the Texas Railroad Commission, and theNational Fire Protection Association.     Apparently the NHTSA is anxious to ensure that only safe vehicles willbe put on U.S. roads, and lacks confidence in the reliability of the carbonfiber composite tanks.  Note:  Carbon fiber composite tanks are notvulnerable to sulfuric acid which had caused the rupture of twofiberglass/epoxy composite tanks. (See Vol. 11, No.1, Pages Eleven andTwelve.)  Meanwhile, foreign manufacturers likely would not be impacted bythe higher safety factor.  Unless amended or postponed because of industryprotests, the new standard is scheduled to take effect on March 27, 1995.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995SURFACE TRANSPORTATION MATERIALS ROADMAP DEVELOPED     In response to Dr. Mary Good, Undersecretary for Technology, U.S. Dept.of Commerce, an ad hoc industry committee has developed a technologyinsertion plan for the application of advanced materials (especiallycomposites) in surface transportation.  Objective is low-emission, lighter,and more fuel-efficient vehicles at dramatically reduced cost.   Thecommittee consists of 14 private sector organizations, chaired by JerryFields, Vice President of Atlantic Research Corp.

Purpose is to demonstrate feasibility in avariety of highly visible applications so as to instill confidence for boththe vehicle manufacturers and end-users, and promote a robust advancedmaterials manufacturing infrastructure that will grow as markets expandand/or emerge. Key is the selection of composite materials applicationtargets:  near-term (1-3 years) -- light-duty electric vehicles, bus framesand bodies, rail car components, locomotive cab structures, truck trailerbeds, automotive seat frames, and marine fenders;  mid-term (3-6 years) --brakes and suspension components, CNG fuel tanks, automotive drive traincomponents, flywheel energy storage systems, passenger rail cars, trailerframes, glazing, a fifth wheel, and an electric vehicle chassis;  and,long-term (6-9 years) -- automotive engine components, design methodologyand standards, Class-A finish body components, monocoque automotivestructures.

Having resolved the concerns resulting from the ruptures of twocomposite NGV tanks (see Vol. 11, No. 1, Pages Eleven and Twelve;  and Vol.10, No. 4, Pages Four-Six), the automotive industry is moving ahead withplans to introduce more NGVs into the market. In addition to General Motorswith 2500 NGV pickup trucks on the roads, Ford and Chrysler are offeringfully warranted NGV trucks and vans;  and, for the 1996 model year, Fordwill offer a Crown Victoria NGV car. Also, NGV buses are already inoperation in many cities in the U.S., with composite tanks generally mountedon the vehicle roofs to avoid loss of passenger space.     Southern Calif. Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric now have 70 NGVrefueling facilities in So. California; hundreds more will be available inthe next five years.  Ultimately, about 10% of all service stations will beable to deliver compressed natural gas.  Travelers at Los Angeles Airport(LAX) will soon be able to ride (in comfort) on NGV Super Shuttle vans.  Thecompany is in the process of converting its entire L.A.-area fleet of 145vans to natural gas. Mesa Corp., the Texas natural gas producer owned byBoone Pickens, is putting up NGV refueling stations at both LAX and JohnWayne Airport in Orange County, Calif., to serve both the Super Shuttlefleet and the public.     Meanwhile, the Applied Physics Lab. at Johns Hopkins Univ. has designedan advanced NGV car under an $800,000 contract from the Dept. of Energy, theGas Research Institute, and several gas companies.  The new design willpermit the car to travel 300 miles without refueling -- whereas the currentvehicles are limited to about 150 miles.     The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition estimates that 5 million NGVs --trucks, vans, buses, and cars -- will be on the U.S. highways by the year2000!%   Advantages Are Significant;  Few Disadvantages     NGVs have important advantages over conventional gasoline-poweredvehicles: Key is much lower pollution, satisfying most state vehicleemissions requirements.  Natural gas is readily available in the U.S.  NGVslend themselves to standard automotive industry assembly-line production.Fuel cost per mile is about one-third less than gasoline.     A major challenge is developing the infrastructure to handle therefueling and servicing of NGVs.  NGVs are somewhat heavier in order toaccommodate the storage of compressed natural gas.  To the extent that tanksare stowed in the trunks, less trunk space is available.  Current NGV costsare as much as $4500 more than comparable gasoline-powered vehicles.Improvements in storage space and lower costs are expected as the industrybecomes more mature.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995%     Manufacturing Composite Structures is a new focus areas for the%     Manufacturing Composite Structures is a new focus areas for theAdvanced Technology Program (ATP) of the National Institute of Standards andTechnology (NIST) of the U.S. Dept. of Commerce.

At a special plenary session on "Advanced Materials Applications,"Dick Hadcock, vice president of RNH Associates (6 Sue Circle, Huntington, NY11743; phone:  516/271-7037) reviewed the evolution of composites inaircraft structures.  Starting in 1940 with glass fiber-reinforced polyesterradomes and drop tanks, aircraft structural applications have grown steadilyin both variety and quantity.       Glass/phenolic firewalls were introduced in 1944.  It was in 1952when glass/epoxy became available and has since been used extensively inradomes, rotor blades, floors, doors, control surfaces, empennages, wingsand fuselages. Glass/polyimide radomes, firewalls, and high-temperatureducts were introduced in 1960.  By 1969, aircraft were using boron/epoxycomposites in stabilizers, rudders, reinforcements and patches for repair ofother structures. That same year, carbon fiber/epoxy composites wereintroduced in stabilizers, wings, fuselages, air brakes, control surfaces,spoilers, doors, floors, inlet ducts, cowlings, and thrust reversers.Kevlar/epoxy was introduced in 1971 in radomes, fairings, andleading/trailing edges.  Carbon fiber/polyimide engine inlet ducts and flapswere produced in 1974.  Carbon fiber/BMI composites in wing flaps, strakes,wing/fuselage skins, stabilizers, engine casings, and thrust reversers wereintroduced in 1978.  Carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastics were firstintroduced in stabilizers and wing ribs in 1988.       Concomitantly, composite structural weight in U.S. aircraft hasexperienced a dramatic rate of growth.  In 1960, use of composites on theA-6A was just 200 lbs.  By 1970, the F-14A was introduced with 521 lbs. ofcomposites.  The F/A-18A had 1320 lbs. in 1978;  the AV-8B used 1615 lbs. in1981.  Currently the F/A-18E/F is using 2820 lbs.  And the F-22A will soonbe in service with 5680 lbs. of composites.       Foreign military aircraft have likewise taken advantage of compositesstructures.  According to Hadcock, the French Dassault Mirage F1 used 150lbs. of composites when it went into service in 1976, increasing to 1200lbs. in the Mirage 2000 in 1978;  and then 3200 lbs.in the Rafale C/M in1991. Russia has also used composites in its aircraft;  the Mikoyan MiG-29fighter, introduced in 1977, uses about 1000 lbs. of composites in theempennage and control surfaces. The Swedish SAAB Gripen fighter, which firstflew in 1989, uses 1250 lbs. of composites for wings, canards, controlsurfaces, and doors.       Military  transports and bombers use large quantities of composites.The Ukranian Antonov An-125 heavy transport (1984) uses 12,000 lbs. ofcomposites; and the McDonnell Douglas C-17A (1991) uses 15,000 lbs. forcontrol surfaces, fairings, doors, and nacelles.  Composites usage inbombers has grown from 10,000 lbs. in the bomb bay doors, fairings,longerons, and nacelles of the Rockwell B-1B (1984) to about 50,000 lbs. inthe wing skins, control surfaces, and doors of the Northrop B-2A (1989).       The growth in airliner applications is also quite remarkable.  TheBoeing 757 was introduced in 1982 with 3800 lbs. of composites. TheMcDonnell Douglas MD-11 (1990) uses 11,000 lbs. and the new B-777 is usingabout 30,000 lbs. per vehicle!  Since 1983, Europe's Airbus usage ofcomposites has grown from 9900 lbs. on the A310 to 25,000 lbs. on the newA330 and A340 (1991).        In 1988, the French/Italian ATR-72 became the first fully certifiedairliner with a CFRP wing.  (Note:  This is the aircraft that  recently wasinvolved in the American Eagle Flight 4184 crash in Indiana during a severerain storm, killing all 68 people on board.  Initially, there was somespeculation that the composite structure may have been at fault;  however,icing is considered the most likely cause. An earlier version, the ATR-42was known to have icing problems.)%   The Future is Bright       In terms of world-wide aircraft production, Hadcock expects thatmilitary and civil aircraft will require over 6 million lbs. of compositesin 1995.  He predicts usage will approach 15 million lbs. by the year 2010.Civil aircraft will account for 80-90%.       Hadcock's data was part of a study conducted for the NASA LangleyResearch Center, Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) Office, to chroniclethe lessons learned during the past 25 years while composite structuralcomponents for aircraft were being developed, produced, and put intooperation.       Conclusions:  Composites are accepted as alternatives for metals inaircraft structures.  Advantages include weight savings and improvements incorrosion and fatigue resistance.  Use of composites will expand, butcomposite parts do cost more than aluminum;  special skills are required formaintenance and repair;  and there is need for standardized materials andprocesses specifications.%   A Changing Environment       Chairing the plenary session on "Advanced Materials Applications," CecilSchneider, Manager of the Advanced Structures & Materials Division of LockheedAeronautical Systems (Marietta, GA), discussed some of the changes taking placein the aircraft industry that are bound to have a profound effect on materialstechnology, including composites and adhesives.       "Affordability," he said, "is the key design driver for future DoDsystems."    For commercial aircraft, "life cycle and direct operating costsare the key design drivers," he added.  This means reductions in fabricationcost, development time, and operations and support costs, in addition tolower materials costs.       Challenges to materials technology include weight reduction,increased fatigue life, and higher structural temperatures.       Schneider called for a "paradigm shift in design philosophy."  In thepast, contractors treated almost everything as proprietary;  there waslittle sharing of data.  The trend is for increasing collaboration withgovernment agencies and other companies in the industry, including teamingup on important programs.  From this, he expects there will be importantspin-offs of the aerospace technology to commercial applications -- such asbuses, autos, Maglev rail transportation, shipping, and construction.%   Barriers to Composites Applications       Dr. Andy Pickard, Vice President of Engineering at Rolls-Royce (Atlanta,GA),        addressed the barriers that composites must overcome in order torealize new applications in commercial and military markets.  For composites togain acceptance in aircraft gas turbine engines, with which his company isconcerned, the customer needs to have confidence that the technology willsatisfy his requirements.  Key issues are predictable and consistentperformance, integrity and reliability (including cyclic life), maintainabilityand customer support, repairability,  environmental friendliness, and low costof ownership.       The cost  barrier includes material cost, processing cost (ofparticular concern for metal-matrix composites), evaluation cost, and thehigh cost associated with usage of "niche materials" that are produced inlow volume.  On the other hand, Pickard noted that system cost reductionsmay be possible by reducing weight in many applications.  This would be aspecial advantage for composites in competing with other structuralmaterials.%   NIST Advanced Technology Program Will Grow       Another special plenary session at the SAMPE Technical Conferencefocused on technology transfer.  Speakers representing the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Sandia National Lab., theWashington Technology Connection, NASA, and the Air Force Wright Labs.described their respective organizations' efforts to transfer technologyfrom aerospace/defense to commercial applications.       Dr. John P. Gudas, program manager for NIST's Advanced MaterialsAdvanced Technology Program (ATP), expects that NIST's budget will steadilyincrease over the next few years:  $199.5 million for FY'94;  $431 millionfor '95;  $543 million for '96;  and $744 million for '97.  NIST hascommitted $150 million over the years 1995-1999 to invest in its ATPdesignated "Manufacturing Composites Structures."       Areas of interest include composites in offshore applications,automotive and infrastructure.  To be placed on the NIST mailing list,phone: 800/ATP-FUND.

In 1991, the firm was awarded a Phase I SBIR program from theNaval Research Lab. which led to the development of an expert system forselecting adhesives for 44 different adherends, "almost every type ofengineering material joining need," according to Robert B. Allen of AJI.Twenty-six different adhesive families are included.  JOINADSELECT willidentify the primary and secondary adhesive materials to satisfy the user'srequirements.     Co-authored by Allen and Hans H. Vanderveldt of the American WeldingInstitute, the paper describes how the effort has now advanced into the nextphase with additional support from ARPA  to develop JOINEXCELL (JoiningExpert Manufacturing Cell).  This is a computer-aided software tool tofacilitate joint design and will consist of expert systems that interactwith the user and a series of databases to accomplish various tasks withinthe joining sequence. Expert systems include the Joining Scheduler, JointSelection, Joint Designer, Adhesive Selection, and Curing Process Selection.Efforts are underway to collect adhesive test data for incorporation intothe databank.Environmental Regulations Can Have Serious Impact       Environmental, health, and safety (EHS) regulations are having amajor impact on processes used in the aerospace industry.  Speaking at asession on Adhesive Bonding/Surface Preparation/Composite Repairs, SAMPEpresident Susan Ruth of The Aerospace Corp. (El Segundo, CA) explained that"development of a substitute chemical or elimination of a process will notbe a trivial matter in many instances."  Part of the problem is deciding howbest to qualify a substitute material or process.       She described an example of a program impact:  A subcontractor haddeveloped an assembly using an adhesive system that relied on methylenedianiline (MDA), a hazardous air pollutant (HAP).  During development a newhealth and safety regulation was issued which necessitated a change.  Therewere two alternatives.  One approach would require compliance with theregulation, for which the cost would be about $250,000.  The secondapproach, which was deemed preferable, was to switch to an adhesive andprimer system that do not contain MDA.  Specifications were modifiedaccordingly to accommodate the new materials, and process validation wasinitiated.  However, problems soon emerged "with the ability to reproduciblygenerate the required mechanical properties," necessitating further processdevelopment.  Not only was there a schedule delay of approximately 10months, but further work also had to be done by both the adhesivemanufacturer and the company  "to make the material and the processproduction-ready."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995%   Grid-Lock( is a unique sandwich structure developed by Tolo Inc.

Blackwell, president of Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.(Marietta, GA) was the keynote speaker at the recent SAMPE TechnicalConference in Atlanta, GA.     Our aerospace/defense environment is changing.  There are no majorpowers threatening world stability.  The defense budget is shrinking;  andmilitary aircraft manufacturers are consolidating.  (Prior to 1945 therewere 14 U.S. prime military contractors.  With the proposed Lockheed/Martinmerger, 1995 will leave just 5 prime contractors.)  In order to survive, theremaining contractors must establish a lean enterprise--focusing on selectedmarkets;  re-engineering the organizational structure; overhaulng the coreprocesses;  developing advanced technologies;  and achieving reductions intotal costs.  Expected benefits:  greater customer satisfaction;  best valueproducts;  and greater shareholder value.         LASC is organizing by  business lines to co-locate personnel on aproject basis;  and the management structure is "being flattened" (25%reduction).  Programs are being organized to implement integrated productteams. Computer integrated systems are being applied to overhaul the coreprocesses, including materials, design, fabrication, assembly, and businesssystems.  Lean fabrication is concentrating on focused factories to includecomposites, fiberglass/honeycomb, welding, wiring, painting,  tubing,machined parts, small extrusions, and bench assembly.  Also, the factorywill use a paperless shop order system.  These and other  changes are expectto be completed in 1997.        The composites focused factory will co-locate all relevant processesand include updated equipment such as automated ply cutting andlaser-projection for ply layup.  Improved quality and cost reductions arealready being realized. ---- "Look ahead where the horizons are absolutelyunlimited."  ---  Robert E. Gross, founder of Lockheed AircraftBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995SPACE APPLICATIONS NEW     McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (Huntington Beach, CA) is continuing towork on the Delta Clipper (DC-X) vehicle to demonstrate technology for areusable, single-stage to orbit launch vehicle.  Responsibility for theprogram has been transferred to NASA.  The current one-third scale modelwill be upgraded to a two-thirds model -- making even more extensive use ofadvanced composites for significant weight savings.  If all goes well, thenext step would be a full-size flight model.       The composite aeroshell was damaged in a recent test when anaccumulation of vapors from the propulsion system caused an explosion.  Theaeroshell is being repaired in preparation for further tests.     Meanwhile, NASA has announced plans to award a $24 million, 13-monthcontract to study the X-33, a heavy-lift vehicle intended for bothgovernment and commercial payloads.  McDonnell Douglas is expected to teamup with Boeing;  the other contenders are likely to be Lockheed and RockwellInternational.  If the X-33 program continues as planned, NASA would fund asecond phase in 1996 for the construction and test of an X-33 prototype.Over $600 million would be allocated for this effort.     Subsequently, industry would be expected to make the heavy investmentto produce a fleet of the vehicles.  To a large extent, this decision wouldbe made based upon whether DoD would use the X-33 for military missions.%   Potential Conflict with DoD     Recently the Air Force announced plans to upgrade the currentlyavailable expendible launch systems -- the Titan, Delta, and Atlas --  intoa single family of launch vehicles.  The Air Force would invest as much as$2 billion for this effort.     According to Richard del Bello, Assistant Director for Aeronautics andSpace Policy for the Administration, these programs represent no conflict.The DoD effort would serve medium-term needs for the military; the NASA X-33program looks to the long term.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995UPDATE:   THE CARBON-PHENOLIC  SITUATION     The  problem is still serious because of its potential impact on launchvehicles that are essential to U.S. defense systems, but a solution appearsto be at hand.     There is a single source, with limited capacity,  for theAerospace-grade rayon fiber qualified for conversion into carbon fibersuitable for use with phenolics in high-temperature propulsion systemcomponents.  Fortunately, the situation has been somewhat ameliorated by thedownturn in the aerospace industry so that available supplies are adequatefor at least several years.     For the long term, the plan (and hope) was to use readily availablePAN-precursor carbon fiber as an alternative.  After considerable R&D by theNASA Solid Propulsion Integrity Program, it was indicated that low-fired PANmay be suitable.  Accordingly, tests were conducted last year using largesubscale motor firings -- but the PAN-based materials did not perform well.Considerable "pocketing" occurred.     Still hopeful, it was then decided to retest the PAN-based carbonmaterial with the same phenolic resin.  But this time, several processingmodifications were evaluated.  Parts made with lower-resin content prepregperformed well! Thus it was demonstrated that, with suitable M&Poptimization, low-processed PAN-based carbon fiber can provide a relativelylow-cost and stable supply replacement for the Aerospace-grade rayon.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995ALERT . . .Stripping coatings from Composites     Environmental and safety regulations have virtually eliminated the useof chemical strippers for removal of paints/coatings.  Increasingly,industry is resorting to dry mechanical stripping processes such as blastingwith solid beads or powders.  For both composites and metals, blasting witheither plastic beads/powder or wheat starch has been found to be quiteeffective.       However, plastic media are more aggressive and can damage the surfaceof composites -- esp. resin removal, leaving fibers exposed.  Wheat starchis quite effective and less prone to cause damage to composite substrates.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995THE DoD PLAN FOR SPACE LAUNCH MODERNIZATIONComposites Likely to Play Important Roles       Lt. General Thomas S. Moorman, Jr., head of the Air Force SpaceCommand, recently briefed key government and congressional committees on theresults of a study requested by Congress as part of the FYU'4 DefenseAuthorization Act. The study was considered necessary because space launchis regarded as a critical issue for America's future in space.       Four options are offered -- ranging from merely sustaining theexisting system (the least costly) to developing a reusable launch vehicle(the most costly but of the greatest long-term value).  Among the mostsignificant findings and recommendations: %   The DoD core space launchtechnology is significantly underfunded. %   A number of areas need to beaddressed for cost reduction, including improving the reliability (the highcost of failure) and reducing operations costs. %   A heavy-lift launchvehicle capability is required for the foreseeable future. %   There is ageneral concensus on the potential  benefits of a new, reusable system --but there are widely divergent views on timing, approach, cost, and risk.  Acooperative DoD/NASA technology maturation effort is recommended. %   DoDand NASA space launch programs need to be better coordinated.  The studyrecommends DoD be responsible for expendable vehicles and NASA take the leadfor a reusable system.%   DoD should continue to monitor the development of small launch vehiclesbut let the commercial market take the lead.%   Lightweight structures and reusable launch vehicle technologies areareas of special interest that need to be addressed.       These findings and recommendations  translate into more emphasis oncomposites technology for weight savings;  heat-resistant composites;life-cycle cost reductions (including manufacturing costs);  improvedreliability and quality control (especially robust designs, in-processcontrols, and non-destructive inspection);  more standardization;  andrepair technology.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary-March 1995COMPOSITES FOR SERVICE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES       The NASA Advanced High-Temperature Engine Materials TechnologyProgram (HITEMP) is developing extensive technology on advanced compositesfor high-temperature applications.       During FY'94 and FY'95, NASA  plans to spend $13 million on R&D inthis area, including 49 contracts to industry and 13 university grants, aswell as in-house efforts.  In addition, NASA has funded a largeinterdisciplinary grant program with Pennsylvania State University as partof its HITEMP project.%    The 7th Annual HITEMP Review was held October 24-26, 1994, sponsored byNASA Lewis Research Center. Presentations emphasized polymer matrixcomposites for use up to 600 degrees-700F, metal-matrix composites up to2200 degrees F, and ceramic-matrix composites for use up to 3000 degrees F.       Of special interest, Textron Lycoming (Stratford, CT) and BrunswickComposites (Lincoln, NE) are collaborating to apply composites asreplacements for metal components in turbine engines to save weight and cutcost.  To date, the team reports a 30% weight savings and 10% costreduction;  much of this was achieved by reducing the number of detail partsin the assembly.  Current efforts are directed at the fabrication of anet-shape compressor case by filament winding using a polyimide resin withS-2 fiberglass and carbon fiber reinforcements for the inner skin (exposedto hot gases) and a carbon fiber/epoxy outer skin, adhesive bonded to apolyimide honeycomb core.

"This is by far the highestoperating temperature for an interband transition laser at thiswavelength," he explained. "We now have a device that works with acompact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldy cryogenicsystem, and room-temperature operation is just around the corner."The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-IIquantum-well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVECand then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing thematerial growth and device design for diode lasers that can producesufficient power at 3 to 5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVECscientists are also testing a more advanced quantum-cascade laserdesign, which should produce higher-intensity light with lesselectric current while emitting within either of two atmospherictransmission windows of 3 to 5 microns and 8 to 12 microns.Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicleand air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covertillumination for night vision, free-space communications, and IRcountermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly inthese windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhouse-gas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical processcontrol, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IRsystems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compactIR sources are available.The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at muchshorter wavelengths. Long-distance telephone networks use 1.3 and1.5 micron lasers in their optical fiber systems, and a 0.8 micronbeam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible lightranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readilyabsorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmissionwindows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within thewindows are too bulky and expensive for most commercialapplications.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996InGaN LEDs withQuantum WellsShuji Nakamura of Nichia Chemical Industries Ltd. (Dept. Of R&D,491 Oka, Kaminaka, Anan, Tokushima 774, Japan), in a paperpresented at the Materials Research Society's Fall Meeting,reported the successful growth of high-power blue, green, andyellow light-emitting diodes with quantum-well structures.  Thedevices are based on III-V nitrides and were grown by metalorganicchemical vapor deposition (CVD) on sapphire substrates.The single quantum-well (SQW) structured LEDs are described incontrast to InGaN/AlGaN double-heterostructure devices.  The latterproduce high-power output in the blue and blue-green regions witha broad emission spectrum represented by a full width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of 70 nm and output power over 1 mW.The SQW LEDs feature a thin InGaN active layer, from which a high-power emission with a narrow emission spectrum is obtained.Typical FWHM for green LEDs of this type is 45 nm, 20 nm from bluedevices, and 90 nm from yellow devices.  Power output from the sameLEDs were 1 mW, 4 mW, and 0.5 mW respectively, all at 20milliamperes.  The drop in output power with the emissionwavelength increase from blue to yellow was noted.One primary goal of the research was to improve the performance ofgreen LEDs.  Those made from GaP and AlInGaP exhibit emissionwavelengths of 555 and 570 nm and external quantum efficiencies of0.1% and 1% respectively.  The SQW LED described by Nakamuraachieved a quantum efficiency of 2.1% at a peak wavelength of 525nm, a pure green emission.  The 555 and 570 nm emissions aredescribed as yellowish green.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996InGaAs PhotodetectorsSet a RecordA record low dark-current operation of InGaAs (1.55 micron) p-I-nPhotodetectors on silicon and GaAs has been reported in AppliedPhysics Letters.  The authors, led by F. E. Ejeckan (School ofElectrical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853; E-mail: felix@ee.cornell.edu), fabricated the photo conductors byfirst bonding the p-I-n epitaxial layers, followed by chemicalremoval of the host InP substrate from the p-I-n structure, afterwhich the photodetector was fabricated on top of the exposed p-I-nlayers.Bonding of the photodetector to the substrate is done as efforts atheteroepitaxial growth have not met with success due to theinherent material defects present in devices grown by this method.Bonding eliminates these material defects, but the films often aremechanically weak and thermally unstable.  The technique employedby the authors of bonding by atomic rearrangement (BAR) avoids thisweakness and obtains a covalently bonded interface free of defectsother than crystallographic misfit.Under 5 volt reverse bias, dark currents down to 57 pA on GaAs and290 nA on Si were measured.  A external quantum efficiency of 80%was deduced from the responsivity at 1.55 microns of 1 A/W, and theseries resistance across the bonded interface was 17 ohms for GaAsand 350 ohms for Si.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Low-TemperatureGrowth MethodA chemist at Washington University (St. Louis, MO 63130) hasdiscovered a new method to grow semiconductor crystals attemperatures far lower than ever reported.  The method is the firstto use solution-phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sizedcrystals of indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), andindium arsenide (InAs) at low temperature.  The semiconductors madeby the new method may be used in devices such as light-emittingdiode displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact discplayers, and computer components.  The breakthrough offersintriguing possibilities for developing integrated devicesconsisting of semiconductors and polymers, plastics, or composites.Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combiningother materials with the semiconductors because of the very hightemperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currentlyproduced at temperatures of 500 oC-1,200 oC, but the method WilliamE. Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, E-mail: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu),associate professor of chemistry, has discovered allows growth at200 oC.  Buhro's technique, the solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growthmethod, is similar to the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) gas-phase growthmethod that has been used for some 30 years.Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by thenonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which donot allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at lowtemperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium andindium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are thesites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds InP, GaAs, andInAs (type III-V semiconductors) nucleate and grow.Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solidmechanism, a three-phase system where the chemistry occurs insolution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited intothe liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizesout as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is toturn down the heat on solid-state synthesis.  This new methodexpands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Optical AND Gate inGe-Doped Silica GuideAn all-optical programmable AND gate has been fabricated in agermanium-doped silica waveguide (P.M. Ranon, Air Force TechnicalApplications Center/TXO, 1030 S. Highway A1A, Patrick Air ForceBase, FL 32925; E-mail: pmranon@crusher.aftac.gov).  The gateconsists of the Ge-doped silica planar waveguide, a Q-switched anda mode-locked Nd:YAG laser and coupling two fundamental frequencybeams into different guiding modes of the waveguide along with asecond harmonic beam coupled into one guiding mode.The waves interfere in the guide, generating a set of semi-permanent second-order susceptibility gratings that generate secondharmonic light.  When optically programmed, the second harmoniclight behaves as an output of an AND gate with a signal-to-noiseratio of 17 dB.The waveguide was produced by ion-beam sputtering of silica andgermanium (6 atomic %) onto an optical grade silica substrate to athickness of 2.0 microns.  Indices of refraction were 1.532 and1.546 at the fundamental (1064 nm) and second harmonic wavelengths(532 nm), respectively.  The second harmonic of the film had  anoutput of 150 mW.  This type of gate is expected to be able to beextended to other logic functions, with an electronic NOT gatepossibly forming a complete set.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Room Temperature SiHigh-Vacuum BondingBonding of 4-inch silicon wafers has been done at room temperaturein ultrahigh vacuum conditions.  After local initiation of theprocess, it is essentially self-propagating, with resultant bondedwafers having bulk-like properties.  According to U. Gosele (MaxPlanck Institute of Microstructure Physics, Weinberg 2, D-06120Halle, Germany; E-mail: goesele@mpi-msp-halle.de), this is incontrast to the current technological process, which requiresheating to 700oC to reach the required bonding strength.Commercially available 4-inch (100 mm) Si wafers were etched indilute HF to remove the oxide and to make the surfaces hydrophobic.Two wafers were bonded in a microcleanroom set up at roomtemperature and then transferred to an UHV chamber that was pumpeddown to 3x10-9 Torr.  The wafers were separated, and the residualhydrogen volatilized by raising the chamber temperature to 600oC-800oC.  After cooling to room temperature, the wafers were rebondedwith an estimated bonding speed of greater than 1 m/sec, incontrast to the bonding speed in atmospheric conditions of 0.01m/sec.  High-resolution transmission electron microscopy showed thebonded interface to lack any defects aside from the unavoidablecrystalline mismatch at the interface.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Thermal AnnealingImprovements in GaNRapid thermal annealing of GaN in argon or nitrogen at temperaturesup to 1100oC has been shown to improve surface morphology andphotoluminescence in Applied Physics Letters.  Atomic forcemicroscopy characterization, done by a group led by J. C. Zolper(Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185-0603; E-mail:jczolpe@somnet.sandia.gov), showed the average root mean squaresurface roughness to decrease from about 4 nm to about 1 nm afterannealing at 1100oC.  Band-edge luminescence intensity wasincreased by a up to a factor of four after a 1100oC anneal, whichimproves the ratio of the band edge to deep-level luminescence andalso reduces the electron concentration and mobility.These developments will enhance GaN-InN-AlN materials technology,with which a number of improved electronic and photonic deviceshave been developed.  Reduction in  the electron mobility can beexplained in terms of  two-band conduction mechanism or anincreased compensation ratio.  The improvement in surface roughnessmight be attributed to quenching of the high-temperature surfacestate, but more work is required to explain the mechanism behindthe improved photoluminescence of GaN with thermal annealing.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Spire Wins Contract toPush GaAs TechnologySpire Corp. (1 Patriots Park, Bedford, MA 01730-2396; Tel: 617/275-6000, Fax: 617/275-7470) announced earlier this month the receiptof a contract from the Naval Research Laboratory for the continueddevelopment of gallium arsenide (GaAs) monolithic complementaryheterojunction bipolar transistor (CHBT) push-pull power amplifiersand operational amplifiers.  Power amplifiers have applications inphased-array radar and mobile phone communications, whileoperational amplifiers are used broadly in analog electronics thatrequire high-speed analog-to-digital and digital-to-analogconverters.The company will use selective metalorganic chemical vapor-deposition techniques to integrate both Npn and Pnp HBTs on onewafer in a planer topography. Pascale Gouker, manager ofMicroelectronic Structures at Spire, said that though the researchwill be done on 2-inch GaAs wafers, 4-inch wafers will eventuallybe qualified for use by the developed technology.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Heat Treatment forPTCR Barium TitanateSemiconducting barium titanate (BaTiO3) is of interest for avariety of applications but is difficult to manufacture due to thenecessity of preferential distribution of dopants in the titanategrains and the sensitivity of the positive temperature coefficientof resistance (PTCR) performance to the heat-treatment scheduleused to sinter the microstructure of these electronic ceramics.Prof. Vasantha Amarakoon at Alfred University (New York StateCollege of Ceramics, Alfred, NY 14802; Tel: 607/871-2497) reportsin the Journal of the American Ceramic Society  the effects of heattreatment on PTCR behavior.The PTCR behavior occurs as a result of either doping BaTiO3 withan aliovalent ion or heating in a low-oxygen atmosphere thatreduces Ti4+ to Ti3+.  Electronic conduction occurs up to the Curietemperature (about 120oC) where the resistance increases by severalorders of magnitude.  The necessity of achieving uniformdistribution of liquid-phase additives (excess barium, tin) isdealt with by using a gel-coating process of the grains.  The PTCReffect is seen to develop when the material is cooled to theannealing temperature, as the grain boundaries rapidly oxidize whenthe liquid phase there solidifies.  Oxygen diffusion continuesduring annealing and cooling, which increases the PTCR response.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 199611.4 MHz TransmissionUltrasonic TransducerSurface micromachining of gold-coated, nitrided, oxidized, highlydoped p-type (100) silicon has been used to fabricate novelcapacitive, ultrasonic air transducers at 11.4, 9.2, and 3.1 MHz.The transducers consist of circular silicon nitride membranessuspended above the heavily doped silicon.  Electrostatic forcesattracting the membrane towards the Si are resisted by stresses inthe membrane when a voltage is applied, so the membrane returns toits original position when a voltage oscillation is switched.  IgalLadabaum (E. L. Ginzton Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford,CA 94305; E-mail: igal@leland.stanford.edu) and coworkers report inApplied Physics Letters  that their devices have a bandwidth rangeof 5-20%.Detection of 10 MHz capacitance fluctuations as small as 10-18farads can be made, corresponding to displacements on the order of10-3 Angstroms in a bandwidth of 2 MHz and a signal-to-noise ratioof 20 dB.  The detection sensitivities obtained can withstand morethan 100 dB of signal attenuation, which makes these devices ofinterest for ultrasonic imaging, nondestructive evaluation, gas-flow and composition measurements, and range sensing.  Theseproperties are a marked improvement over piezoelectrics for airapplications that suffer from a six-order-of-magnitude differencein acoustic impedances between air and piezoelectrics.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996AT&T Dials Up NewWay to Passivate GaAsAT&T IPM Corp. was issued U.S. Patent 5,464,664 on Nov. 11, 1995,for a downstream ammonia plasma gallium arsenide (GaAs) passivationtechnique that claims fast, stable, room-temperature operation.The inventors are Eray S. Aydil, Konstantinos P. Giapis, andRichard A. Gottscho.A workpiece with an exposed GaAs surface is passivated by placingthe workpiece in an evacuated chamber and generating an ammoniaplasma between 10 and 30 cm from the workpiece and  causing theplasma products to flow downstream into contact with the workpiece.The plasma gas pressure is held between 0.5 to 6.0 Torr, and theexposure time should be sufficient to increase thephotoluminescence intensity of the gallium arsenide by at least afactor of 10, which is said to be more than five minutes.Though the patent abstract specifies a  substrate temperature ofless than 100oC, it also specifically states that the process canbe done at room temperature.  The workpiece should also not beplaced within line-of-sight of the plasma to avoid UV, visible, andx-ray radiation-induced damage for a time sufficient to increasephotoluminescence intensity from said gallium arsenide by at leasta factor of 10.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Diffusion BarrierMethod PatentedAT&T was issued U.S. Patent 5,468,689 on Nov. 21, 1995, for amethod for preparing a silicon nitride gallium diffusion barrierfor use in molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium arsenide.The inventors are John E. Cunningham, Keith W. Goossen, William Y.Jan, and James A. Walker.The technique involves reacting nitrogen and silane in a ratio ofless than 300:1 in a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor-depositionapparatus to form a silicon nitride layer.  This layer is depositedon a reflowable glass layer previously deposited on a (100) siliconsubstrate oriented 3 degrees off axis and bearing a thin film ofsilicon dioxide.  Finally, GaAs is deposited by molecular beamepitaxial growth on the silicon nitride layer.  The technique issaid to be of interest for use in the monolithic integration ofinterconnected GaAs/AlGaAs double heterostructures, modulators, andsilicon MOSFET structures.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Hughes DevelopsImproved HEMTsHughes Aircraft Co. was issued U.S. Patent 5,471,077 on Nov. 28,1995, for a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) and a methodfor its fabrication.  The inventor is Marko Sokolich.  Improvementin the device results from alloying the diffusion layer.The resulting HEMT includes a diffusion barrier, made of titaniumnitride, that prevents gate-metal diffusion into the substrateduring fabrication and a sacrificial platinum alloy layer thatforms the Schottky barrier.  The titanium nitride layer is formedon a platinum layer, and sufficient heat is applied to cause theplatinum layer to alloy with the gallium arsenide layer forming aplatinum gallium and a platinum arsenide alloy layer and Schottkybarrier.All the platinum is consumed in this method, so precise control ofthe thickness of the gate layer is achieved, and diffusion of theplatinum gate layer into the gallium arsenide layer during laterprocessing steps is eliminated.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Hg-Based SuperconductorsChallenge ResearchersA paper presented by Paul Chu et al (The Texas Center forSuperconductivity and Dept. Of Physics, University of Houston,Houston, TX 77204; Tel: 713/743-8212) at the fall meeting of theMaterials Research Society focused on research underway on mercury-based high-temperature superconductors, the homologue series,HgBa2Can-1CunO2n+2+d [Hg-12(n-1)n or HBCCO] with n = 1, 2, ...7.They were first found by a Swiss team in Zurich to besuperconducting at temperatures up to 134K.  Later, the Houstongroup raised the superconducting temperatures of these compounds toa record-high temperature of 164K by squeezing the sample, makingit possible for the first time to achieve the superconducting stateby the use of household air-conditioning technology.These materials exhibit an impressive current-carrying capacity ofup to 1 million amperes per square centimeter at 100K, observed bythe IBM group at Yorktown Heights after making the compound intothe thin-film form.  The figures translate to a theoretical limitof about 10 million amperes per square centimeter at the liquid-nitrogen temperature of 77K.Chu said that because of the simple and subtle crystal structure ofthe compounds, specifically the linear Hg-O coordination thatallows a large cation-doping range, scientists are given theopportunity to peer into the effects of atomic arrangement anddoping on the occurrence of superconductivity at high temperatures.Some of the experimental results on these compounds havedemonstrated the limits of and the modifications needed in some ofthe prevailing models of high-temperature superconductivity.  Asuperconducting quantum-interference device (SQUID) was made fromthis compound and operated at the unprecedentedly high temperatureof 114K by the IBM group.However, he added that the mercury-based compounds are ratherunstable.  Usually, they are not easy to make in pure form, andthey decompose easily at the high temperatures required to shapethem into practical forms, such as wires for power transmission andgenerators.   This is to say that Hg is lost at temperatures above350oC.Recently, progress has been made in this respect.  By doping thecompounds, the synthesis of the materials has been simplified andthe materials so prepared become more stable.  Preliminary successhas been achieved in wire-making.  Small single crystals of thecompounds have been obtained with high enough quality forscientific study.However, more material improvements are needed before these newcompounds can become a material of practice. Chu was not availableto elaborate on these topics at press time.  Look for a follow-upin next month's issue.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Optical Waveguides ofAlumina Thin FilmsAlumina waveguides formed by reactive rf magnetron sputtering werestudied by researchers at Massachusetts Insitute of Technology andHanscom Air Force Base (Lionel O. Bouthillette, OptoelectricComponents Branch, Hanscom AFB, Bedford, MA 01731-2909) as acandidate material for optical waveguides.  Use of sputtering toform alumina films enables it to be deposited in the amorphousstate, removing the necessity of achieving a crystallographic matchwith the substrate.  The researchers describe in the Journal of theAmerican Ceramic Society amorphous alumina films deposited attemperatures up to 800 oC and varying oxygen flow rates in thedeposition chamber.The refractive index of the amorphous alumina films averaged 1.65over a transmission range of 200 nm to 7 microns with reproduciblelosses of 1dB/cm at a 632.8 nm wavelength.  A refractive index ofgreater than 1.4 is desirable for compatibility with silicontechnology and less than 1.8 for coupling with fibers.  Thechemical inertness, adherence, hardness, wear resistance, andmechanical durability of alumina films additionally makes thesematerials suitable for waveguide applications.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Lightning Optical PicksUp Two SBIR ContractsTwo Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contracts totalingalmost $700,000 have been awarded to Lightning Optical Corp. (431E. Spruce St., Tarpon Springs, FL 34689; Tel: 813/938-0092, Fax:813/938-9493). Gregory J. Quarles and Arlete Cassanho, director ofresearch and senior research scientist, respectively, at LightningOptical, will head up the programs.The first is a $600,000 Phase II award from NASA Langley and willbe in support of solid-state laser materials development at NASALangley's Flight Electronics Division.  The SBIR is effectivethrough 1997 and covers the crystal growth of highly-dopedCr:LiSrAlF6 (LiSAF) for diode-pumping applications.The program's primary emphasis is for the company to make use oftheir proprietary Czochralski fluoride growth technique to developand commercialize a reliable source of LiSAF materials.  Thecharacterization and optimization of the furnace thermalcharacteristics and various growth parameters and their impact onthe crystal structure during the growth process will be included inthe development.Quarles noted that the Phase II award follows a $65,000 Phase Iprogram completed in July 1994, which proved that the materialcould be grown and losses minimized.  Lightning Optical's processresults in LiSAF ingots about 25 mm in diameter and 170 mm inlength.The second award is a $71,500 Phase I contract from the Departmentof Energy and will be in support of component development for LaserTechnology for Chemical Analysis and Nonproliferation Activitiesfor DOE.  The SBIR is effective from Sept. 1, 1995, to March 23,1996.The emphasis of the research will be crystal growth andcharacterization of Cr-doped LiSrGaF6 (LiSGaF) for diode-pumped,solid-state laser applications.  A second focus is on thedevelopment of environmentally rugged ultraviolet coatings fornonlinear crystals.  The final area of research is the measurementof thermo-optical parameters and laser efficiencies of Cr:LiSAF andCr:LiSGaF under identical conditions.  The purpose of this testingis to determine which material is more robust and better suited tothe applications.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Display Panels Madefrom Plastic WrapU.S. Patent 5,469,020 was issued on Nov. 21, 1995, to theMassachusetts Institute of Technology for a flexible large-screendisplay that has multiple light-emitting elements sandwichedbetween crossed electrodes.  The inventor is Bradley R. Herrick(Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel: 617/981-3356).  Theresulting panels are especially well adapted to inexpensive flat-panel TV screens or exceptionally large flat-panel displays whosegeometry is not limited to flat surfaces, but may take on curved orcylindrical configurations.The patent abstract explains that active light-emitting componentsare integrated into a thin, flexible, plastic-wrap like film toprovide an exceptionally large continuous display in which the filmcontains densely distributed light-emitting elements that areaddressed by a grid of transparent conductors.  Inexpensive bulkprocessing techniques are used to produce plastic wrap withembedded components completely through the film to permitactivation via a row-column matrix.  The displays are comprised ofa flexible film having two opposing sides and a pair of crossedelectrodes on either side of the film.  A number of light-emittingelements are dispersed in the film and extend from one side of thefilm to the other, sandwiched between the crossed electrodes.  Thelight-emitting elements are small enough to permit numbers of theelements to exist at a crossover.The topological layout provides mass redundancy of components,spatial decorrelation of component yields, and dramatic reductionin registration problems of metallic interconnects.  The design canbe used for electroluminescent tape in automotive pin striping andsign applications, for flexible glue-on displays, and for videodisplays such as workstations, HDTV, theater screens, andbillboards.Herrick explained that the patent is based on theory for the timebeing, and that no working models currently exist.  He also saidthat calculations indicate that the thinner the plastic the better,and he would initially be working with films in the 10 to 100micron thickness range.  The concept involves placing up tohundreds of diodes in a single pixel, making the technology mostsuitable to displays larger than 60 inches diagonally and scaleableto even larger sizes.

Texas Instruments was one ofnine companies and military organizations that collaborated withthe U.S. Department of Energy in a task force evaluation of the useof such processes for making military components. The task forcewas organized by Sandia National Laboratories, a DOE multiprogramnational laboratory.Conventional processes for soldering printed wiring boards use anactivated rosin-based flux prior to soldering to remove oxidation.Oxidation also is prevented by doing the soldering in a sealednitrogen chamber. The rosin-based flux leaves a tacky residue thatpreviously was removed with ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon(CFC) solvents. It has been estimated that solvents used to cleanelectronic equipment accounted for 24 percent of the consumption ofCFCs in the United States.Low-residue processes eliminate the need for these CFC cleaningsolvents by using a mild organic acid as the fluxing agent. Theseorganic agents, such as the common food additive adipic acid, leavelittle residue and require no cleaning.When the Low-Residue Soldering Task Force was organized in 1993,low-residue processes were being used for commercial applications,but the Department of Defense required that use of the low-residueprocesses to manufacture military equipment be negotiated on acontract-by-contract basis. The task force was charged withevaluating these processes for general use in manufacturingmilitary electronic components.Sandia researcher Ron Iman (Tel: 505/844-8834) chaired the taskforce, which consisted of 17 core members and a team of more than100 people from 17 companies, three military services, and 12laboratories and technical centers.The task force tested low-residue processes at four manufacturingsites -- Texas Instruments, Hughes Electronics, AlliantTechsystems, and AlliedSignal's Kansas City Division. Each companyused low-residue processes to produce 80 test printed-wiringboards. After extensive testing, the task force concluded thatthese boards were as good as those manufactured by using rosinflux.For confirming the value of the low-residue soldering processes,the task force was recognized with the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency's 1995 Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award.Stephen O. Anderson, deputy director of the EPA's StratosphericProtection Division, called the task force's findings "one of themost important soldering reports of the decade."Besides Sandia and the four companies, other organizationsparticipating in the task force were the Naval Air Warfare Centers(China Lake, CA, and Indianapolis, IN); the Army Missile Command(Huntsville, Ala); the Air Force Materiel Command (Wright-PattersonAir Force Base); and the Electronics Manufacturing ProductivityFacility.Jeff Koon, a Texas Instruments process engineer who served on thetask force, says Texas Instruments is now using a low-residueprocess in its production facility in McKinney, Texas. Using theprocess is saving more than $300,000 annually in materials costs,Koon says. It also is simpler to use and saves time in theproduction process.Koon says the low-residue process is friendlier to the environmentin several ways. It eliminates the need for CFCs and other noxiouscleaning materials, and it significantly reduces the amount of leaddross produced during the manufacturing process.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Qualitek, Heraeus IntroNew Products at NEPCONQualitek International Inc.

The newregulation, which went into effect Dec. 20, liberalizes exportcontrols on certain semiconductor devices shipped to China, therepublics of the former Soviet Union, and certain otherdestinations for civilian end uses.In a statement released to coincide with the start of the newpolicy, SIA President Thomas W. Armstrong said, "This modernizationof export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needlessand costly licensing delays and burdensome paperwork.  Thesereductions will lead to further export opportunities in areas withmajor growth potential over the next decade."The SIA notes that commercial semiconductors represent one of theleast controllable and most widely available high-technologyproducts in the world today.  Further maintenance of the old exportcontrols would have damaged U.S. industry without making anymaterial contribution to U.S. security.Armstrong added, "The Commerce Department has made substantialprogress in the reduction of outmoded export licensingrequirements.  Continuation of this export liberalization processto reflect the end of the Cold war will only stimulate businessopportunities and job creation."In a related development, SIA also reported that the foreign sharein the Japan market for semiconductors rose more than 3% in thethird quarter to 26.2%.  Though no specific figures regarding theU.S. share of the increase were available, Armstrong touted thecompetitiveness of domestic chip makers as well as the U.S.-Japanagreement as major factors.  SIA spokesman Jeff Weir said thatindications pointed to a "substantial" U.S. share in the increase.Armstrong also added that "strong relationships between the U.S.and Japanese industries are being built," which would not have beenpossible without the agreement.

Radiance Services was one of only five companies orinstitutions so honored.The novel system cleans wafer surfaces without the use ofchemicals.  It makes use of a pulsed-laser light source radiatingbetween 172 and 257 nm and a flowing inert gas.  The energyimparted by the light lifts away contaminants, which are thencarried away by the flowing gas.  The light's energy is capable ofbreaking covalent, ionic, coulombic, dipole-dipole, and hydrogenbonds holding the contaminants to the surface.  Laminar flow of thegas is said to provide a stable boundary layer, preventingcontaminant reattachment.The company recently announced an agreement with MicroelectronicsResearch Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency for the EPA to provide funding toacquire a Radiance Process wafer-cleaning system for ademonstration project.  The project is to be managed by the MRL andthe EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory.

Theindustry believes that static-related problems cost it more than$100 million a year in lost productivity and reduced yields.Now, a new group has been formed to add muscle to the fight againststatic discharge problems.  The Exit-Charge Working Group is madeup of Arnold Steinman of Ion Systems, Julian Montoya of IntelCorp., David Jensen of Advanced Micro Devices, Michael Yost of theUniversity of Washington, Vaughn Gross of IBM Microelectronics,Robert Donovan of Sandia National Laboratories, Steve Silverman ofMeissner & Wurst, Fred Lakhani of Sematech, Al Lieberman ofParticle Measuring Systems, Jay Shideler of National Semiconductor,and Chris Billat of KLA Instruments.At the Group's second meeting, held recently in Austin, TX,Steinman noted that the ESD Association studies the effects ofstatic charge from and on people but have yet to tackle equipmentissues.  According to Gross, its goal is the development of a SEMIstandard that will "set acceptable levels of static charge for thepurposes of eliminating equipment problems due to ESD events thatproduce electromagnetic interference, eliminating equipmentproblems due to difficulties in handling charged objects, reducingthe attraction of particles to charged surfaces, and reducingproduct and reticle damage due to ESD."Steinman added that existing SEMI Standard 801-2 does address ESDimmunity levels for equipment only, and it relies on test levelsthat are much lower than is actually experienced in operation.Thus, the standards fall short of protecting both wafers andequipment at key stages of the manufacturing process.The Group will focus on the development of a matrix of variouslevels of static charge and recommended practices.  A meeting withSEMI standards officials is set for the Working Group's nextgathering, which will take place in Norfolk, VA, where theformation of a standards committee on exit charge will bediscussed.

Azzam.As a result of the new technology, CRI expects polarization to findwide use in optical systems such as lasers, modulators,interferometers, etc.  The company believes the devices could finduse as transducers to monitor coating and film-productionprocesses, as well as in the development and use of opticallyactive chemicals, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals.According to CRI President Paul Nordine (Tel: 708/476-2678, Fax:708/467-2679), the lack of a simple, portable device for measuringpolarization has limited the development of polarimetryapplications.  He called the new invention a  breakthrough that is"smaller, lighter, faster, and simpler than conventionalinstruments, as well as more rugged, sensitive, and repeatable.  Weenvision an accurate device with no moving parts, prisms, beamsplitters, or modulators, capable of real-time resolvedspectropolarimetry."Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Product Award toDigital InstrumentsDigital Instruments (520 E.

Although current inspectionsystems generate large amounts of defect data, the info is onlyvaluable if device makers can use it to improve their manufacturingprocess.  Therefore, they need a fast, reliable means of viewing,analyzing, and acting on the defect data generated duringinspection.  SwiftAccess is designed to meet this need.The system collects and analyzes defect data as it is gathered frominspection systems, scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), reviewstations, and probe and test systems, and then uses the informationto monitor the process, identify process excursions and providecritical process-control information.  It can distribute data overmulitple networked nodes, independent of the hardware platform, andcan collect data from the majority of inspection systems.  Designedfor ease of use, SwiftAccess features an X-Windows architecture andUnix operating system that enable smooth integration into a fab'sexisting network.  The system offers high reliability androbustness, as well as scalability for next-generationapplications.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996New CopperHeat Sink DesignAavid Thermal Technologies Inc. (1 Kool Path, P.O. Box 400,Laconia, NH 03247-0040; Tel: 603/528-3400, Fax: 603/528-1478) hasadded a new heat sink to its extensive lineup designed to cool low-power devices in surface-mount packages.  The devices use highlyconductive copper in a profile only 0.013 inches thick for use intight quarters.According to Gary Kuzmin, Aavid's director of corporate technicalmarketing, the new Thin-Fin product line may be affixed to asurface-mount package even if heat sink attachment was notconsidered in the design process.  The low-profile configurationrequires minimum vertical clearance and allows continued reductionsin system enclosure sizes.The surface of the heat sink extends beyond the boundaries of thepackage, increasing the dissipating surface.  Further, the extendedsurfaces are scored to allow for folding of the devices to provideclearance around other components.  A pressure-sensitive adhesiveis pre-applied.  The adhesive has a low modulus to take up CTEmismatch and is pliable to conform to surface irregularities.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996BOOKS AND REPORTSEDN Offers New Guide toAnalog Circuit DesignA part of EDN's Series for Design Engineers edited by Jim Williams,The Art and Science of Analog Circuit Design, is an interesting andunusual blend of prose (Art) and how-to (Science).  The 398-pagevolume, a follow up to the original Analog Circuit Design - Art,Science, and Personalities, is sprinkled with anecdotes offered upby each of its 17 authors, including Williams, so much so as tomake it interesting to read in its own right.  Also included is achapter adapted from a commencement address given at Cal Tech byRichard P. Feynman in 1974, a truly fascinating eight pages.The book is presented in four parts: Learning How; Making it Work;Selling It; and Guidance and Commentary.  In its 20 chapters can befound such topics as design productivity, signal conditioning, ICdevelopment, computer use, and linear IC design.  The volume alsoincludes a heavy and perhaps necessary, emphasis on economics.Like it or not, a good design is worthless if it can't be sold.The book is published by Butterworth-Heinemann (313 Washington St.,Newton, MA 02158-1626; Tel: 617/928-2500, Fax: 617/928-2620).Every Aspectof VCSELsVertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers, by Terence Edward Sale ofthe U.K.-based University of Sheffield, covers the principles,theory, design, and operation of vertical cavity surface-emittinglasers (VCSELs).  Semiconductor lasers have advanced a long waysince their first demonstration in the early 1960s and have a largeimpact on many devices today.They act as sources for optical fiber systems and permit thereading of data from compact discs and barcode labels.  VCSELs havemany advantages over conventional semiconductor lasers.  The mostobvious is the possibility of very large arrays and a narrowcircular output beam, which can be efficiently coupled into thecore of a fiber.  As a result, the author believes that the timefor a book devoted to VCSELs has come.The first chapter of the volume describes the history and prospectsof VCSELs and the choice of material systems for emission indifferent wavelengths.  The second chapter concerns the opticalproperties of short vertical cavities, and the quantum-mechanicalprocesses facilitating optical gain and spontaneous emissionprocesses are the focus of the third chapter.  Concepts aredeveloped from basic principles, and the effect of strain on theoptical processes in quantum wells is also covered.  Readers areintroduced to techniques for epitaxial crystal growth and thefabrication of VCSEL devices in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 exploresthe resistance problems that can arise due to the manyheterojunctions in dielectric reflector stacks.Chapters 6 and 7 are case studies that describe measurements madeon 2 VCSEL structures, one grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)and the other by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).In Chapter 8, experimental data from these case studies areanalyzed using models, and the final chapter describes otheraspects of VCSELs, such as modulation response, arrays, and noiseperformance.The book does a good job of covering the VCSEL field and should beof value to those experienced in the optics field, as well as tonovices and students.

These materials areNorton NC430 and CS101K.  The NC430 is an earliermore expensive material that requires an extrafurnacing operation during processing.  Batch-to-batchvariation in the microstructure of CS101K results inlarge differences in creep rate and time-to-failure forthat material.

Reactions are observed in an open-air furnace,under static vacuum (in an evacuated quartz tube), andin a dynamic vacuum furnace.  High-speed videotapes ofreaction syntheses of compacts formed from 45(mu)m Feand 10(mu)m Al powders reacted in air and under staticvacuum, reveal that an unusual two-stage reactionexists in this system under these conditions.  Thefirst stage of the two-stage reaction lasts severalseconds, and starts at around 650 C.  The second stagebegins at about 900 C, reaching temperatures between1250 C and 1350 C.  The progress of the reaction to thesecond stage is sensitive to the alloy composition andreaction environment.

The performance ofhigh-speed computers depends not only on IC (integratedcircuit) chips, but also on the signal propagationspeed between these chips.  The signal propagationdelay in a computer is determined by the dielectricconstant of the substrata material to which the ICchips are attached.  This work develops a ceramicsubstrate having a low dielectric constant(k = approx. 5.0).  When compared with traditionalalumina substrata (k = approx. 10.0), the new materialcorresponds to a 37% decrease in the signal propagationdelay.Glass hollow-spheres are used to introduce porosity(k = 1.0) to the alumina matrix in a controlled manner.A surface coating technique, involving heterogeneousnucleation in aqueous solution, is used to improve thehigh-temperature stability of these spheres.  Aftersintering at 1400 C: the isolated spherical pores areuniformly distributed in the almost fully-dense aluminamatrix; negligible amounts of matrix defects are seen;and all of the pores are isolated from each other.Detailed analyses of the chemical composition find thatthe sintered sample consists of alpha-alumina, mullite,and residual glass.  Mullite is the chemical reactionproduct of alumina and the glass spheres.  Residualglass exists because the current firing conditions donot complete the mullitization reaction.The dielectric constant of the sintered sample ismeasured and compared with the predicted value, usingMaxwell's model.  Mechanical strength is evaluated by afour-point bending test.  Although the flexuralstrength decreases exponentially with porosity, sampleshaving 34% porosity (k = approx. 5.0) still maintainadequate mechanical strength for the proper operationof a microelectronic substrate.(Order from T&T Engineering PC, P.O.

Their calculations show that this material, a cubic formof carbon nitride, C3N4, should be significantly less compressiblethan diamond at room conditions.Inasmuch as low compressibility is correlated with hardness, it ishighly possible that the new material could be harder than diamondand therefore of significant technological use as a superabrasivematerial and for wear-resistant coatings.These results, reported in the January 5 issue of Science , restupon state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations. The levelsof speed and accuracy now attainable in such calculations enableinvestigators to design materials by doing experiments on thecomputer instead of in the laboratory. Scientists are thusbeginning to rationally design useful materials in a more efficientmanner than by the traditional "shake-and-bake" methodology offinding new materials.The investigators in the new work are David Teter and RussellHemley, both serving at Carnegie's Geophysical Lab and Center forHigh Pressure Research. Teter and Hemley's work grew fromwidespread interest in the possibility of finding new lowcompressibility materials. Various forms of carbon nitrides hadbeen proposed as possible superhard materials potentially exceedingdiamond in hardness. Teter and Hemley identified several favorablecandidate C3N4 prototype forms and calculated their energetics,structures and physical properties. They determined the cubic-C3N4form to be the most incompressible.Their calculations indicate that the cubic- C3N4 material can besynthesized at pressures and temperatures now attainable in thelaboratory. (The material would be formed at high pressure andtemperature, and then quenched stably to ambient conditions.)Scientists at the Carnegie institution and elsewhere are alreadyworking to accomplish this, employing insights gained from thetheoretical work now reported. Conceivably, the material caneventually be synthesized at an industrial scale using technologysimilar to that now used to synthesize industrial diamond.Teter and Hemley write that most experimental studies of carbonnitrides have been carried out at ambient or low-pressureconditions; their results indicate the importance of high-pressuresynthesis in the search for new carbon nitrides.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Fibrous Monoliths fromPowder ProcessingAdvanced Ceramics Research Inc.

The currentdevelopment efforts have mainly concentrated on advanced ceramiccomposites, with certain hybrid composites being fabricated todemonstrate the versatility of the processing technology.The fibrous monolith concept produces--through ordinary powderprocessing--dense fired ceramics with graceful failurecharacteristics plus strength and toughness values typicallyexhibited for more costly continuous fiber-reinforced ceramiccomposites (CFCC's).  These composites have been expected to becomemain load-bearing components for many lightweight, high-temperaturestructural applications - such as gas turbine engine components.As of this date, CFCC's have found only limited use althoughresearch and development efforts are continuing. Currently CFCC'smajor obstacles are limited formability and product repeatability,although scientists working on CFCC's are confident that they couldsolve these problems. However, the problems they consider difficultto solve are achieving longer life for the components plus bothhigh starting material and high fabrication costs.Advanced Ceramics Research believes fibrous monoliths havecommercial potential in applications now targeted for CFCC'sbecause of their ease of formability, as-fired damage-tolerantbehavior, and inherent low cost (processed entirely withconventional powder starting materials).Fibrous monoliths are multi-phase monolithic ceramics consisting ofa primary phase of high aspect ratio polycrystalline cellssurrounded by outer cell-boundaries of secondary and/or tertiaryphase(s) of different polycrystalline materials.  When engineeringdesign calls for multiple cell-boundaries, usually, the cell-boundary adjacent to the cell represents regions of lower shearstrength interdispersed with cell regions of high strength.The engineered micro architecture of a simple cell/cell-boundarystructure has the appearance, in the as-fired materials, of wood;hence the apt description of "ceramic wood."  The cell-boundariesof low shear strength will entrap a propagating crack, therebyinducing crack deflection during fracture.  This process dissipateslarge amounts of energy and leads to non-catastrophic failurebehavior.  It must be mentioned again that there are no denseceramic fibers incorporated as starting materials.The fibrous, polycrystalline, micro architecture of an as-firedbody is an exact replica of the ceramic green body.  This greenbody is in-turn formed from ceramic powder-loaded polymer fibersarranged into a desired micro architectural array (uniaxial,biaxial, woven fabric, chopped fiber) and then laminated into arectangular billet or complex-shape part."Green" ceramic fibers are the only building blocks of the fibrousmonolith, for they consist of a core of primary (cell)polycrystalline powder in a polymer binder, surrounded by shells ofpolycrystalline powders in a polymer binder.  Powders must be sizedso that they can be processed in standard thermoplastic extrusionequipment, and they must be thermodynamically compatible.Preparation of ceramic green bodies proceeds as follows: co-extruded single filament is either chopped or cut to desired lengthand then laid up into rectangular billets, or woven into 3-D mats.These pre-shapes are then laminated into rectangular billets--atypical shape in use for process development.In another micro architectural configuration, co-extruded multi-filament rods are cut to desired lengths, aligned inside the dieinto either 0 uniaxial or 0-90 biaxial arrays, and thenlaminated into rectangular billets.  The billets are then loadedinto a hot-pressing die, binder burned out in a controlled-atmosphere furnace, and the billet(s) hot-pressed under 25 MPauniaxial pressure until ram compaction ceases.After hot pressing, near full density is achieved and the billet(s)are machined into various test configurations.  These 0-90biaxial arrays, in the as-fired condition, have the microscopicappearance of plywood.  Developmental work is under way to use co-firing techniques (successfully utilized in the ceramic electronicindustry) to sinter both the cell compositions and the cell-boundary compositions simultaneously. Limited fibrous monolithiccompositions have been co-fired to acceptable final densities. Co-firing promises increased final shape complexity employingsintering techniques versus hot pressing.Government contracts are driving the development of this fibrousmonolith prototype manufacturing for producing small volumes at lowcost using a wide variety of ceramic compositions in a variety ofapplications.  Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. supplies greenfiber and billets, and can debond, hot press, and sinter a limitednumber of shapes.Contract: William J.

The project is funded by a 3-year $3.54million program sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency(ARPA) and the Office of Naval Research."This method looks like it's going to be very successful," saidRichard Chartoff, UDRI senior research engineer and principalinvestigator.  "There's no shape distortion or shrinkage of thepart when it's processed, but the main advantage is speed.  Thenormal processing of high-temperature ceramics takes weeks."Using a $200,000 laminated object manufacturing (LOM) machinedeveloped by Helisys Inc. (Torrance, CA), the researchers aredeveloping a special fabrication technology.  The LOM systemusually builds layered 3-D objects by stacking and fusing thinlayers of paper that are trimmed to shape by a laser.  Instead ofpaper, UDRI has developed ceramic powders held together by apolymer binder to form "tapes" slightly thicker than a sheet ofpaper that are fed into the machine.In the next stage of the project, researchers will reinforce theceramic matrix composites with fibers to increase strength, developa laser that is more suited to working with ceramics than paper andhelp Helisys develop its next-generation LOM machine.The research team already has used the technology to build ceramicelectrical components and miniature body armor, among other parts,but Chartoff is most excited about its potential medicalapplications. "There is interest in using this method to make bonereplacement shapes," he said.  "The ceramic forms a shell, whichwould eventually be absorbed in the body when replaced by new bonegrowth. This is an ideal way to make bone structures--particularlyif we are successful in putting fibers in the ceramic to make itstronger," Chartoff continued.Contact: Richard Chartoff, University of Dayton Research Institute,300 College Park, Dayton, OH 45469-1679; Tel: 513/229-2517.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Keeping the TroopsSafe in BosniaWhile ceramics are more often thought of as gifts for the holidayseason, ceramic technology and products are playing a vital role inprotecting U.S. peacekeepers in Bosnia.  From lightweight, easilyinstalled ceramic armor in aircraft and helicopters to protectiveshielding used for tanks, personnel carriers and trucks to personalbody armor for troops in the field--the benefits of advancedceramics are quite evident in this important mission."Advanced ceramics have the double benefit of being harder than thebullets and shells fired at them while weighing about half as muchas traditional steel armor," explained Robert Skaggs, a seniormaterials scientist at Los Alamos National Lab and a member of TheAmerican Ceramic Society (ACerS).The ceramics advantage already has been demonstrated through acreative application on numerous aircraft, including the AirForce's C-141.  Previously unarmored, the C-141s were vulnerable tosmall-arms fire from ground snipers.  A new, modular, lightweightceramic/metal ("cermet") composite armor was developed that can betransferred from one aircraft to another, with a total installationtime of about two hours."The portability feature ensured that any plane could be armoredquickly and easily without having to armor all of the planes, aproject that would have been far too expensive and required toomuch time," said Frank Gac, leader of the Los Alamos NationalLaboratory's Ceramic Science and Technology Group and a member ofThe American Ceramic Society (ACerS).This new portable armor was developed by a team of workers from LosAlamos National Lab, Foster-Miller Co. and Lanxide Armor Products,Inc., an ACerS corporate member.  The armor consists of severalmats of 4 in. square tiles manufactured by Lanxide from a siliconcarbide/aluminum nitride ceramic composite.  Kevlar, a wovenpolymer fabric manufactured by DuPont, is adhered to the back ofthe cermet armor.  Foster-Miller then integrates the resulting matsinto a kit that is delivered to the Air Force.  The armor isattached to the plane's interior using a heavy-duty hook-and-loopfastening material.Skaggs explained that the cermet and Kevlar combination acts as a"catcher's mitt" for bullets fired at the plane.  "When a bullethits the cermet tile, the bullet essentially disintegrates, withoutdamaging the entire tile," Skaggs said.  "The energy from thebullet is absorbed through the tile while the Kevlar catches thebullet fragments, preventing injury to the occupants or furtherdamage to the plane or its cargo."Ceramic-based armor also is used in Apache, Cobra and Blackhawkhelicopters.  Manufactured by ACerS corporate member Ceradyne Inc.,(Costa Mesa, CA) and Cercom (Vista, CA), the armor is incorporatedinto the seats, floors and wall panels of cockpits to protect thepilots.One of the more difficult challenges the peacekeeping force isexpected to encounter is the large number of camouflaged minesplaced throughout the Bosnian countryside by the warring factionsduring the last several years of conflict.  Trucks, personnelcarriers and tanks use ceramic armor to provide a previouslyunavailable degree of protection and safety.The LAV-25, for instance, has used modular ceramic armor since theGulf War.  Designed to enhance protection against fragments from152 mm artillery projectiles encountered during the war, the armornow protects troops from exploding land mines in Bosnia.Manufactured by Lanxide and by Coors Ceramics Co., a Golden, CO-based ACerS corporate member, the LAV-25 armor can be applied insingle or multiple layers and can be repaired in as little as 20minutes from the on-board battle damage repair kit.Troops in the field also are protected by ceramics.  To increasetheir protection from larger rounds, troops slip a ceramic plateinto special pockets in their bullet-proof vests, often made ofKevlar. Manufactured by Ceradyne, Coors and others, the half-inchthick ceramic plates protect troops from armor-piercing bullets byadding about 20 lbs. to the vests' weight.Contact:  Wayne Hill of the American Ceramic Society (Tel: 614/224-4600); or Robert Skaggs of the Los Alamos National Lab (Tel:505/455-2392); or Lt.

By producing composites withimproved properties, the process may allow replacement of costlyreinforcing fibers with less expensive platelets or particles,driving down the cost of composite materials."This idea offers the chance of improving materials properties--particularly toughness--and lowering costs," said W. Jack Lackey,a research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI)."This gives us a wide range of possible new material systems we canuse."Two conventional techniques exist for making mechanically toughcomposites.  The first uses fiber reinforcement within matrixmaterials such as ceramics or metals, while the other relies onbuilding up multiple bonded layers of different materials such ascopper and aluminum."We have combined those two approaches," explained Lackey.  "Wemake a fibrous preform by stacking up layers of cloth, theninfiltrate a matrix into the preform one layer at a time.  Weinfiltrate for a few moments with one material until we get a layerof it around each fiber, then we infiltrate for a few moments withanother material, then we switch back to the first.  We keepiterating until we have put down as many as 50 layers."Sponsored by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, thework initially focused on infiltrating a carbon fiber preform withalternate layers of carbon and silicon carbide matrix.  However,the new process should also be applicable to silicon carbide oraluminum oxide fibers, as well as to metallic, polymeric or ceramicmatrix materials.Lackey notes that the matrix materials--which bind thereinforcement fibers together and fill in the space between them--must be carefully chosen to be chemically compatible and closelymatched in their thermal expansion properties."We need to consider how these materials will work together," hesaid.  "Carbon and silicon carbide are a natural choice.  We knewthose materials were easy to infiltrate into a preform, and we alsoknew that they were compatible chemically.  We want to be able tostudy what kinds of materials do work well in this type ofcomposite."The Georgia Tech research team, which also includes SundarVaidyaraman and Shelli Godfrey, used forced-flow thermal-gradientchemical vapor infiltration to apply layers ranging in thicknessfrom 0.02-0.5 microns.  The layers were formed by alternating theprecursor gases flowing into the chemical vapor infiltrationreactor.Beyond improving the properties of fiber-reinforced composites, thelaminated matrix process could also allow the use of alternatereinforcing materials that could lower the cost of makingcomposites.   That could open new applications for compositematerials.Lackey believes the improved strength and toughness of thelaminated layers may allow the expensive reinforcing fibers--whichcost at least $300/lb.--to be replaced by particles or plateletscosting between $2-$30/lb.  Lackey's team has made compositesamples using silicon carbide grit instead of fibers."We have shown that we can make these laminated composites withinexpensive particulates, replacing a costly reinforcing materialwith an inexpensive one," he said.  "But we must demonstrate thatthese materials have appropriate properties.  This is highlyspeculative, but if it works, there would be a very significantpayoff."If long-term testing shows that materials made with the laminatedprocess can provide the necessary properties at a lower cost, thatwould allow composites to compete with metals in additional large-scale applications.  If economically feasible in applications suchas jet engines, for instance, the lighter weight of the laminatedmatrix composite components could allow significant performanceimprovements in the aircraft using them."People are struggling to improve the mechanical properties ofceramics and ceramic-matrix composites to the point that they canreplace metals," Lackey explained.  "If you can replace metals withceramics, you can operate at higher temperatures and get betterefficiency in a heat engine."In addition to obtaining experimental verification of the newmaterials' properties, Lackey must determine the optimalcombination of materials, appropriate thickness of matrix layersand ideal reinforcing structures.  Finally, the process will haveto be scaled up from laboratory samples to full-sized components.Georgia Tech has applied for a patent on the process. Georgiaresearchers presented their work at the American Ceramic Society's20th Annual Meeting on Composites and Advanced Materials in CocoaBeach, FL, January 7-11, 1996.

Robert G. Smithreports that the composite includes ceramic oxide fibers, a coatingof a carbonaceous matrix which includes boron nitride particles,and a silicon carbide coating.Radiant burner tubes are used in high temperature, corrosiveenvironments such as are found in industrial heat treating furnacesand aluminum melting furnaces.  The three most common types ofcommercially available radiant burner tubes are metal alloy, e.g.,nickel-based superalloy, tubes; ceramic, e.g., silicon carbide,monolith tubes; and ceramic composite, e.g., ceramic fibers andceramic cloth in a ceramic matrix, tubes.  The upper usetemperature of such tubes is typically 900-1260(C.Although monolithic silicon carbide radiant burner tubes with anupper use temperature limit of about 1260(C are available, they aregenerally brittle and prone to fail.  This is a common problem ofconventional shaped ceramic monoliths.  While it is possible toselect a conventional ceramic composite from which to prepare aradiant burner tube which meets most of the requirements for use inhigh temperature, chemically corrosive environments, it is onlypossible by taking great care in the selection of materials and bymaking some compromises in properties.The carbon matrix or coating uses amorphous carbon is amorphous,and has a thickness of up to one micrometer on an individual fiber.The 3M product includes 20-50% by weight ceramic oxide fibers, 0.2-20.0% by weight carbonaceous matrix, 0.2-15.0% by weight boronnitride, and 50-75% by weight silicon carbide.

(Fibers Div.,P.O. Box 808, Niagara Falls, NY 14302; Tel: 716/278-2203, Fax:716/278-2440) is readying a panel version of its Excelfrax productline.  Other Excelfrax product forms, including Excelblok rigid-board insulation, are in the development stage.The developmental products, as well as the firm's commmercializedflexible blanket form called the Excelflex Composite Systems, arebased on Excelfrax's core high-temperature insulation material.This material blends ceramic (alumina and silica) powders andfibers to produce a microporous structure.  The structure decreasesradiant heat flow, thereby making Excelfrax materials extremelyefficient insulation materials.  The core material can bemanufactured into a variety of product forms, including compositesystems, molded shapes, and rigid boards.The firm's Excelflex Composite Systems are composed of a high-temperature (1800(F) core material that has been placed between twolayers of a high-temperature textile.  The standard textile is a1200(F S-Glass.  However, various high-temperature textiles can beused in the composite to provide protection from 500(-2,300(F.  Thelayers are compressed into a uniform thickness (ranging from 1/8-inch to 1/2-inch) and density (both standard and lightweight).  Thelayers are then quilted into a finished composite.  The Excelflex'sstandard configuration is 36" x 36" pads that are lock-stitchedinto one-inch squares.Market manager of Carborundum's Fibers Div., Jim Olchawski (Tel:716/278-2008, Fax: 716/278-2440), calls Excelflex's extremely goodthermal conductivity its main advantage.  Because of this excellentthermal performance, Excelflex will provide the maximum amount ofinsulation within the smallest amount of weight and space.  Stableat high temperatures, Excelflex has low thermal diffusivity andexcellent material strength characteristics. Also, Excelflex'sflexibility and ease of fabrication are important considerationsfor many applications.Excelflex provides the best insulation (lowest thermalconductivity) of all the insulating products currently provided byCarborundum.  Olchawski recommends it as the material of choicewhenever high-temperature insulating materials are required andspace/weight savings are the primary consideration.  ExcelflexComposite Systems can reduce heat loss and reduce surfacetemperatures in a variety of materials, includingaerospace/defense, industrial, and commercial markets.Aerospace/defense applications for Excelflex include thermalinsulation/fire protection in aircraft engine struts, nacelles,cowlings, and avionics.  Industrial applications can be found innuclear power plants, petrochemical facilities, and otherindustrial areas (i.e. incinerators, heat-treatment furnaces,insulation for kilns and furnaces, and other metal/glass processingindustries).  Commercial applications include commercial ovens,night storage heaters, and many other appliance applications.Olchawski explains that Excelfrax is a "natural," the direct resultof two principal factors: The company's technical capabilities,developed over many years while working with Fiberfrax refractoryceramic fibers in the same markets and the partnerships createdbetween the company's full-service applications engineering teamand Carborundum customers in developing critical design solutionsfor any application.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Supply Contractfor SiC WhiskersHughes Aircraft Co. will demonstrate the advanced process toproduce low cost aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs) that canmeet the requirements for high-performance military structuralcomponents under a recently awarded $6.2 million U.S. Armycontract.Of this, ART has been given an award worth $480,000 for furtheroptimization of a low cost manufacturing process for SiC whiskers(reinforcements for the metal matrix composites) and for supplyingseveral hundred kilograms of whiskers to the program.These selectively reinforced MMCs have potential applications suchas tracked vehicle tread shoes, powertrain parts, like pistons, andmissile structures.

The ceramic fibers toughen the compositeconstruction and result in a filter with excellent resistance tothermal shock and catastrophic failure.  The filter is used toremove particulate from high temperature gas streams up to 1850F(1010C).  The collected particulate is removed by reverse pulsejet cleaning.The high temperature capability of this filter can eliminate theneed to cool the gas stream prior to filtration, which may increaseprocess efficiency and eliminate the cost and complexity of gasdilution, air scrubbers, or heat exchangers.The light weight (2 lbs.) of this filter reduces the strengthrequirements of the tube sheet, and the excellent thermal shockresistance provides protection during upset conditions.

Higgins.  The problemstems from the large disparity in thermal expansion coefficients ofthese two types of materials.This requirement to seal large gaps between ceramic and metalliccomponents, coupled with the need to maintain appropriate stresslevels on the ceramic components at all temperatures, placesextreme demands on the properties of the material used to seal theceramic-metal gap.  Similar systems operating at lower temperaturesutilize vermiculite-based intumescent mats for this purpose, butsuch materials have limited lifetimes when used at temperatures inexcess of 500C and degrade at temperatures above 800C.CeraMem scientists are investigating the use of multilayer,biceramic composites that can reversibly expand and contractbetween room temperature and 1000C.

However, it is difficult to manufacturedue to the necessity of preferential distribution of dopants in thetitanate grains, and the sensitivity of the positive temperaturecoefficient of resistance (PTCR) performance to the heat treatmentschedule used to sinter the microstructure of these electronicceramics.  Prof. Vasantha Amarakoon at Alfred University (New YorkState College of Ceramics, Alfred, NY 14802; Tel: 607/871-2497)reports in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society the effectsof heat treatment on PTCR behavior.The PTCR behavior occurs as a result of either doping BaTiO3 withan aliovalent ion or heating in a low oxygen atmosphere whichreduces Ti4+ to Ti3+.  Electronic conduction occurs up to the Curietemperature (about 120(C) where the resistance increases by severalorders of magnitude.  The necessity of achieving uniformdistribution of liquid phase additives (excess barium, tin) isdealt with by using a gel-coating process of the grains.  The PTCReffect is seen to develop when the material is cooled to theannealing temperature, as the grain boundaries rapidly oxidize whenthe liquid phase there solidifies.  Oxygen diffusion continuesduring annealing and cooling, which increases the PTCR response.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Optical Waveguides ofAlumina Thin FilmsAlumina waveguides formed by reactive rf magnetron sputtering werestudied by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology andHanscom Air Force Base (Lionel O.

The high-temperature superconducting (HTS) filters, to be used in cellularbase stations, are designed to operate in the 825-850 MHz frequencyrange.The work has been partially supported by a 3-year, $3.5 millionproject funded by the National Institute of Standards andTechnology's Advanced Technology Program.  Other partners in theproject include AT&T Bell Labs and Northwestern University.To make these filters, ISC is using HTS thick-film materialdeveloped by a team, now at the University of Birmingham(Birmingham, England), that was funded in part by Ballistic MissileDefense Organization (BMDO).  While the radio frequency (RF)properties of HTS thick-film materials are not as good as competingHTS thin films, they are much easier to make.  For example, thickfilms can coat 3-D objects (thin films cannot), enabling thefabrication of RF components designed to maximize performance.  Inaddition, thick-film materials can be sprayed, dip-coated, orbrushed onto desired substrates. In contrast, thin films must bemade in clean-room facilities using a sophisticated laser process.Contact:  Jim Hodge, Illinois Superconductor Corp., 1840 Oak Ave.,Evanston, IL 60201; Tel: 708/391-9400.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Hg-Based MaterialsChallenge ResearchersA paper presented by Paul Chu, et al., (The Texas Center forSuperconductivity and Dept. of Physics, University of Houston,Houston, TX 77204; Tel: 713/743-8212) at the fall meeting of theMaterials Research Society focused on research underway on mercury-based high-temperature superconductors, the homologue series,HgBa2Can-1CunO2n+2+d [Hg-12(n-1)n or HBCCO] with n = 1, 2, ...7.They were first found by a Swiss team in Zurich to besuperconducting at temperatures up to 134 K.  Later, the Houstongroup raised the superconducting temperatures of these compounds toa record-high temperature of 164 K by squeezing the sample, makingit possible for the first time to achieve the superconducting stateby using household air-conditioning technology.These materials exhibit an impressive current carrying capacity ofup to one million amperes per square centimeter at 100 K, observedby the IBM group at Yorktown Heights after making the compound intothe thin film form.  The figures translate to a theoretical limitof about 10 million amperes per square centimeter at the liquidnitrogen temperature of 77 K.Chu said that because of the simple and yet subtle crystalstructure of the compounds, specifically the linear Hg-Ocoordination that allows a large cation-doping range, scientistsare given the opportunity to peer into the effects of atomicarrangement and doping on the occurrence of superconductivity athigh temperatures.Some of the experimental results on these compounds havedemonstrated the limits of and the modifications needed in some ofthe prevailing models of high-temperature superconductivity.  Asuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) was made fromthis compound and operated at the unprecedentedly high temperatureof 114K by the IBM group.However, he added that the mercury-based compounds are ratherunstable.  Usually, they are not easy to make in pure form, andthey decompose easily at the high temperatures required to shapethem into practical forms, such as wires for power transmission andgenerators.   This is to say that Hg is lost at temperatures above350(C.Recently, progress has been made in this respect.  By doping thecompounds, the synthesis of the materials has been simplified andthe materials so prepared become more stable.  Preliminary successhas been achieved in wire-making.  Small single crystals of thecompounds have been obtained with high enough quality forscientific study.  However, more material improvements are neededbefore these new compounds can become a material of practice.  Dr.Chu was not available to elaborate on these topics at press time.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Current LimiterPrototype TestedAmerican Superconductor Corp. has successfully demonstrated a 2.4kV high temperature superconducting (HTS) current limiter prototypein partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT), SouthernCalifornia Edison (SCE) and Los Alamos National Lab (LANL).  Theproject was funded by the Dept. of Energy, under theirSuperconductivity Partnership Initiative program.  Thedemonstration took place at SCE's Center Substation in Downey, CA.The current limiter incorporates the world's largest HTS coil,which was manufactured and delivered earlier this year by AmericanSuperconductor.  Current limiters are devices that instantaneouslylimit the flow of electrical current, and mitigate the effects ofshort circuits, lightning or power fluctuations.  The devicesessentially act as giant surge protectors, which protects expensiveutility transmission and distribution equipment.  AmericanSuperconductor expects to commercialize HTS current limiters in the1998-1999 time frame."This demonstration is significant in that it shows that HTS wireand coil technology is advancing rapidly to meet the needs of theelectric power industry," said Dr. Dean Peterson, Center Leader ofthe Superconductivity Technology Center at Los Alamos NationalLaboratory.  He added, "Development of high performance, low costcurrent limiters will yield improved reliability, efficiency andcost improvements for the electric utility industry.Greg Yurek, president and CEO of American Superconductor,commented:  "The successful demonstration of the prototypeutilizing our leading edge HTS coil represents another significanttechnical milestone for American Superconductor and validates ourexpected time line for commercialization of this product line.  Ourcommercialization efforts in the area of current limiters willcontinue with a number of global partners to meet the existing andgrowing demand for HTS devices that overcome the limitations ofconventional copper-based technology."Contact:  Denise Mikulis, American Superconductor Corp., 2Technology Dr., Westborough, MA 01581; Tel: 508/836-4200; Fax:508/836-4248.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Model for ComplexVortex BehaviorOne of the main obstacles in the development of practical high-Tcsuperconducting materials is the dissipation caused by the motionof vortices.  By using the speed and memory of parallel computers,researchers at Argonne National Lab have numerically simulated,using extremely fine temporal and spatial resolution, a model forcomplex vortex behavior.Resulting numerical simulations or vortex dynamics in asuperconducting sample show that, in the presence of a strongmagnetic field, the vortex lattice maintains a superstructure whereregions of varying vortex density are separated by stationary faultlines.  Furthermore, the vortex lattice may have misoriented grainsthat gradually "heal" when subjected to a weak current.  Theresearchers also find that the orientation of the vortex latticedepends on the strength of the transport current.Argonne welcomes collaborations with industry to explore ways inwhich computational models can be used for predicting theperformance characteristics of HTS superconducting wires and tapes.Contact: Argonne National Lab, 9700 South Cass Ave., Argonne, IL60439; Tel: 708/627-2596.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996DOE Presents MaterialsScience AwardsThe Dept. of Energy (DOE) recently presented nine national awardsin materials science to 10 winners in the U.S.  Open to the 14national laboratories, the awards were given in three categories asfollows: metallurgy and ceramics, solid-state physics, andmaterials chemistry.

Researchers Dong-Woo Shinand Keun Ho Auh (Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea) and HidehikoTanaka (National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials,Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan) characterized the mechanicalproperties of various 2D ceramic matrix fiber composites by tensiontesting, using the gripping and alignment techniques. The wovenfabric composites used for the test had the basic combinations ofAl2O3, fabric/Al2O3, SiC fabric/SiC, and SiC monofilament uniweavefabric/SiC.Tension testing was performed with strain gauge and acousticemission instrumentation to identify the first matrix-crackingstress and assure a valid alignment. The peak tensile stresses ofthese laminate composites were about one-third of the flexuralstrengths. The SiC monofilament uniweave fabric (14 vol%)/SiCcomposites showed a relatively high peak stress of 370 MPa intension testing.The full paper is available in the Journal of the American CeramicSociety [78 (11), 1995].Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Behavior of SiCFibers in a MatrixThis work was done by Hyunho Shin at School of Materials Scienceand Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA30332. The full paper is published in the Journal of AmericanCeramic Society [78 (11), 1995].A Nicalon SiC fiber-reinforced Si-Al-Ca-O-N composite wasfabricated by a slurry infiltration process followed by hotpressing at 1600C.  A carbon-rich interfacial layer (~100 nm) aswell as a crystalline silicon-rich layer (~15 nm) were observedbetween the fiber and matrix. Based on this interfacialphenomenology, the following behavior of SiC fibers in the matrixwas proposed:  fine SiC grains (diameter of ~1.7 nm in as-receivedfibers) decomposed at fiber surfaces (SiC  C + Si), followed bysilicon migration into the glassy phase of the matrix.  The glassyphase was interpreted to play a key role as a silicon consumer infostering the formation of the carbon-rich layer.  The presence ofsilicon implied that the oxygen activity in the matrix was lowenough to avoid SiC oxidation.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH CERAMICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996BIBLIOGRAPHIESSintering SiCThe bibliography contains citations concerning the sinteringprocesses used to form silicon carbide powders and products.Processing techniques including high pressure combustion, reactionsintering, pressureless sintering, liquid phase sintering, andmicrowave sintering are covered.

Test methodsare also being created to focus on differences between laboratoryand production tests.  The role pressure plays in seal quality isalso an issue receiving attention.Several of the completed test methods are based on ASTM standards,which include seal strength, inflation testing (burst and creep),and peel strength. The Council is also working on test methods forvisual seal inspection, porosity, and coat weight determination.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Polyimide TubesFinding Medical UsesMicro-Biomedical Tubing Inc. (410A Old Mill Road, Carterville, GA30120; Tel: 770/606-0003), a manufacturer of miniature cathetertubing and electrical sleeving, has introduced a line of polyimidetubing composites that offer a wide range of construction andcomposition options for medical and electronic applications.The LubriFlex, LubriBraid, and LubriCoil products offer insidediameters of 0.0050 to 0.0925 inches and can be custom manufacturedto meet specific requirements. LubriFlex can be made with andwithout Teflon layers in a variety of compositions; LubriBraid isreinforced with a wire or fiber braid in the tubing wall; andLubriCoil is reinforced with a wire or fiber coil.  The wire orfiber braids and coils offer various degrees of stiffness, shockabsorption, longitudinal elongation, and resistance to burstpressure.All three tubing systems can be produced with Teflon on the insideor outside walls or sandwiched between layers.  Fillers can beadded for improved performance or resistance to wear and abrasion.According to the company, the products offer increased lubricity,softness, and flexibility over conventional tubing.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Porosity of NylonFilms MeasuredNylon 610 films show promise for use in drug encapsulation.  KenPhares, M. Cho, Keith Johnson, and James Swarbrick of thePharmaceutical Dept. at the University of North Carolina (ChapelHill, NC 27599-7360; Tel: 919/962-2211) have investigated drugtransport through artificial membrane films composed of Nylon 610.Nylon 610 is a hydrophilic polymer.  The researchers synthesizedthe polymer using an interfacial polycondensation reaction.Hexamethylenediamine, which readily partitions into a good solvent,and sebacoyl chloride were used.  The sebacoyl chloride was asolvent blend of chloroform and trichlorotrifluoroethane in varyingratios (1:1, 1:4, 4:1).  Phares and coworkers observed that the useof hexamethylenediamine allows the formation of a high molecularweight polymer before precipitation.The films resulting from these synthesis variables werecharacterized on the basis of porosity, thickness, molecularweight, and crystallinity.  Transport of potassium chloride,hydrocortisone, and m-creosol were measured for the differentfilms.  Chloroform concentration was found to be the most importantfactor in the resulting molecular weight of the film.  With anincrease in molecular weight, increases were observed in filmthickness, porosity, and hydrocortisone permeability.  As themolecular weight decreased, permeability to m-creosol increased.Phares and colleagues published "Drug Transport Across Nylon 610Films:  Influence of Synthesis Variables" in PharmaceuticalResearch [12(2), 248-256, 1995].  According to Phares, theirsubsequent work with Nylon 610 microspheres will be published in1996 in the International Journal of Pharmaceutical Advances. Sincethe publication of the article, Ken Phares and James Swarbrick haveleft UNC to work with Applied Analytical Industries (1206 N. 23rdSt., Wilmington, DE 28405; Tel: 910/251-6383).

(12040 115th Ave., Kirkland, WA 98034; Tel: 206/820-4548) acquired from Hymedix International (2235 Route 130, Dayton,NJ 08810; Tel: 908/274-2288) worldwide rights outside of Asia tofive wound-care products that have received market clearance fromthe FDA, broadening the company's planned entry into the moist-wound dressing market.The products include proprietary transparent thin-film wounddressings, aquagel sheet dressings, exudate absorbers, and woundmoisturizers, all based on a multi-block copolymer structures thatare especially well-suited for wound-care applications, includingchronic and acute wounds, burns, and surgical wounds, according toProCyte.The company said that the newly licensed products complement itsinternationally-developed Iamin gel wound dressing, for which FDAclearance to market is pending under the 510(k) pre-marketnotification guidelines. ProCyte said it expects the first of itswound-care products to be available to long-term care, hospital,and home health-care professionals by mid-1996, following equipmentscale-up and design and validation of improved manufacturingprocesses at its Redmond, WA, commercial manufacturing plant.The U.S. market for moist-wound dressings, which include thepolymer-based products ProCyte acquired, is expected to reach $500million by 1999.  Industry sources say market growth for moist-wound dressings and all other wound-care products and systems isbeing driven by an increasing incidence of wounds associated withadvanced age, during which surgeries and chronic wounds tend tooccur more frequently.Centerpiece for ProCyte's newly-acquired products is a versatilepolymer technology, called HYPAN, manufactured by a patented methodto provide a uniquely variable number of structural aquagels,useful in construction of synthetic moist-wound dressings andrelated products. ProCyte also has the worldwide rights outside ofAsia for all future wound-care applications of HYPAN technology forsynthetic moist-wound dressings and related products.As part of its agreement with Hymedix, ProCyte also gainedexclusive worldwide rights for drug-delivery applications of theHYPAN technology for wound care.  ProCyte plans to continue itsresearch and development efforts in wound treatment and healing andto study drug-delivery aspects of technology for enhanced deliveryof antibiotics, anti-infectives, and other compounds to wounds.HYPAN polymers are synthetic materials that ProCyte believes can bemanufactured in a cost-effective manner. The products are believedto provide maximum performance at low concentrations, to haveexcellent biocompatibility profiles, and to be both stable andsterilizable.  The structural flexibility of these aquagels isexpected to make them ideally suited to broad-based applications inwound management and treatment, particularly since they address thebreadth of chronic and acute wounds.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Now BioabsorbableElastomers Are HereElastomers have been extensively used in medical devices,especially thermoplastic copolyesters (COPEs) and thermoplasticpolyurethanes (TPUs). The copolyester elastomers are polymers with"hard" and "soft" segments. While commercial viability ofelastomeric polymers for medical applications has been established,a need exists for certain properties that have not yet been met.For numerous applications, especially for those requiring asurgical device to be implanted in bodily tissue, the polymer fromwhich the device is prepared must be bioabsorbable.  Ethicon Inc.(U.S. Highway 22, Somerville, NJ 08876; Tel: 908/218-0707) hasdeveloped bioabsorbable elastomers made up of random copolymers asreported in U.S. Patent 5,468,253.These copolymers consist of:    epsilon-caprolactone, trimethylene carbonate, an ether lactoneor a mixture of these; and    the balance being substantially glycolide, para-dioxanone, ora mixture of these.The random copolymers surprisingly exhibit elastomeric properties,and the copolymers are bioabsorbable.  Combination of physical andbiological properties of these elastomeric copolymers areparticularly well-suited for numerous medical and surgicalapplications.Complete bioabsorption should take place within 12 months, althoughpreferably bioabsorption will be complete within nine months andmost preferably within six months.  In this manner, the elastomercan be fabricated into medical and surgical devices that are usefulfor a vast array of applications requiring complete absorptionwithin the relatively short time periods set forth.Biological properties of the bioabsorbable elastomer used to formthe device or part thereof, as measured by its absorption rate andits breaking strength retention in vivo, can be varied to suitneeds of particular application for which fabricated medical deviceor component is intended.  This can be conveniently accomplished byvarying ratio of components of the elastomeric copolymer chosen.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Dry Coating ImprovesImplant PropertiesMedical device manufacturers prefer using polymeric materials formaking implants, such as cannulae, needles, catheters, percutaneousconnectors, and the like. Polymeric implants have, however, broughtabout several complications, especially thrombophlebitis andsepsis.  Some workers in the field have investigated the use andbeneficial effect of an in-line filter in reducing infusion-associated infection, in particular phlebitis.  However, othershave focused on the material of the cannula itself.It has been shown that steel needles produce fewer infusion-associated complications that do plastic cannulae.  The issue ishow to advantageously use the desirable bulk property of polymericimplants -- flexibility, avoiding infiltration without adverselyaffecting the patient by exposing him or her to increased risk ofinfusion-associated phlebitis, and infection.Spire Corp. (1 Patriots Park, Bedford, MA 01739; Tel: 617/275-7470)recently won a patent (U.S. No. 5,468,562) for imparting a thinmetallic film to outside surfaces of polymeric implants. Apparatusincludes a vacuum chamber, an evaporator and an ion source mountedin operative association within the chamber.The patent claims improved biocompatibility between implant andbody.  Metal films include chromium and titanium with thicknessesof 0.5 microns.  Claims are also made for use of other metals forbiomedical devices (implants) such as silver, zirconium, tantalum,aluminum, nickel, molybdenum, platinum, gold, and stainless steel.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996On-Line PlasmaSampling DevelopedOften a need exists to sample and analyze the plasma constituent ofblood without affecting other constituents.  For example, end-stagerenal disease ("ESRD") patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysistreatments at home presently send blood samples to laboratories foranalysis.The blood sample is analyzed for general chemistry profiles (e.g.electrolyte, plasma hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, andimmunoglobin concentrations).  Sending out blood samples is tediousand involves a significant loss of the ESRD patient's blood cells.Since ESRD patients are typically anemic, a further loss of redblood cells compounds their anemic condition.Presently, ESRD patients either ignore the problem of furtherblood-cell loss altogether or endure a complicated procedurewhereby  blood cells withdrawn with a sample are salvaged.Since for a large proportion of diagnostic procedures a plasmasample is all that is necessary, a need exists for an inexpensivemeans for collecting a plasma sample without contributing tofurther blood loss of an ESRD patient.University of Utah (Salt Lake City, UT 84112; Tel: 801/581-7200)researchers have developed an extracorporeal plasm filtercomprising a housing, an inlet, an outlet, and a sampling port andcontaining at least a hollow semi-permeable filter fiber throughwhich blood plasma, but not whole blood, may pass.U.S. Patent 5,464,535 has been granted to Udipi Shettigar for thisfilter, which is constructed so that a heterogenous fluid, such asblood, entering the inlet passes into the first open end of thehollow filter fiber and through the fiber.  A portion of the fluid(e.g. a filtrate or diffusate) permeates the semi-permeable portionof fiber to collect within the housing.  The collected portion maythen be sampled from the sampling port.The filter will usually be structured with a plurality of hollowfibers comprising a filter fiber bundle.  These fibers are attachedone to another near their respective ends, e.g. by gluing.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Lab-Grown CartilageOk'd for CompensationThe Florida State Agency for Health Care Administration hasapproved Carticel surgery, an innovative technique utilizing lab-grown cartilage cells, for Workers Compensation benefits, accordingto Dr. Douglas Stringham, the first orthopedic surgeon in Floridaand one of only 15 surgeons in the country to have performed thespecialized surgery."This procedure is supported in the medical literature by basicscientific research, and we've concluded that it is notexperimental and that there are likely to be significant positivebenefits of this procedure to recovery and well-being of theinjured worker," said Suzanne Suarez, senior health policy analystfor the agency."This decision sets a precedent for all of Florida," saidStringham. "We invested a considerable amount of time and energyinvestigating, evaluating, and establishing the procedure as arecommended and appropriate treatment for a defined group ofpatients suffering cartilage injury."Bill Aliski, vice president of patient and product services atGenzyme Tissue Repair (1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 01239; Tel:617/252-7500) the lab where the cartilage cells are grown,responded, "We are very pleased with the decision of the WorkersCompensation Division.  The board has recognized the value of theCarticel procedure and confirms the medical opinion of the surgeon.While this is a first in Florida, other favorable coveragedecisions for Carticel are expected in the future."The technique, pioneered in Sweden by Dr.Lars Peterson, involvesremoving a very small piece of healthy cartilage, growing thecartilage cells in tissue cultures for several weeks, and thenreinjecting them back into the damaged area.  In time, thetransplanted cells heal the defect with cartilage that isessentially indistinguishable from the original normal cartilage.Left untreated, significant cartilage defects progressivelyenlarge, leading to career-ending injuries for athletes and loss-of-job disabilities for workers.  Eventually, untreated defects maydevelop into painful arthritis that often requires jointreplacement.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Engineered HeartValves PromisingAdvanced Tissue Sciences Inc. (10933 N. Torrey Pines, La Jolla, CA92037; Tel: 619/450-5730) announced preclinical data on tissue-engineered heart valves at a recent session of the American HeartAssociation.Current therapy for valvular heart disease includes replacement ofheart valves with porcine xenografts, cryopreserved cadaver, ormechanical valves.  Advanced Tissue Sciences is utilizing its coretechnology to develop tissue-engineered heart valves with improvedfunction and durability in order to overcome disadvantages ofcurrent therapy.Dr. Shin'oka, a fellow in the department of cardiovascular surgeryat Boston's Children's Hospital (300 Longwood Ave., Boston, MA02115; Tel: 617/735-6000) and a collaborator with Advanced TissueSciences, presented data that demonstrated feasibility of utilizingtissue engineering to create heart-valve replacement products.Dr. Skin'oka reported that tissue-engineered valve leaflets weremade by seeding a synthetic biodegradable fiber matrix withfibroblasts and endothelial cells.  Leaflets were then implanted inlarge animals, which were followed for up to six weeks.  Totalprotein and collagen analysis of tissue-engineered heart-valveleaflets showed development of an extracellular matrix andhistologies of the constructs resembled native tissue.  Angiographyand echocardiography demonstrated no stenosis and a minimalvalvular regurgitation.Dr. Zeltinger presented studies that characterized deposition ofhuman-specific extracellular matrix proteins in porcine heartvalves colonized with human neonatal fibroblasts and grown underdynamic flow conditions.  Long-term growth studies indicatedexcellent migration and viability throughout the newly depositedmatrix, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing tissue-engineering techniques to create heart valves.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Microsphere DrugDevice That WorksCurrently systemic antibiotic therapy by intravenous orintramuscular injection is the clinically accepted standard forprevention and treatment of infected surgical and traumatic wounds.Systemic administration of antibiotics is recognized as aninherently inefficient method for delivering drugs because only asmall fraction of total dose actually reaches target area and mostof the drug is excreted unused.Recently, microencapsulated antibiotics have been developed basedon lactic and/or glycolic acid-based biodegradable polymers. Thesemicrocapsules are either injected or layered on to the wound.Uneven drug distribution is often the result.  The injection routeis also only suitable for the area that the needle can traverse.Jean Setterstrom, Elliot Jacob, and Walter Franz received U.S.Patent 5,470,311 for apparatus and methods for dispensingmedicinals encapsulated in a biodegradable polymer in surgical andother wounds. In this procedure, a microcapsule drug applicatorallows the caregiver to implant or spread measured and uniformquantities of microencapsulated medicinals in or on surgical ortraumatic wounds to prevent or treat infections.Specific examples where microencapsulated antibiotics may proveuseful include soft-tissue wounds, following debridement andreduction or fixation of open fractures, onto osteomyelitic boneafter surgical debridement, after surgical insertion of prosthesessuch as hip/knee replacements (arthroplasty), and followingvascular surgery or grafting.Local implantation of microencapsulated antibiotics can provide asignificantly higher local concentration of medication at the woundsite then can be obtained using traditional systemic therapy andoffers the possibility of producing significantly reduced sideeffects.In addition to antibiotics, other drugs and biological agents maybe encapsulated and administered in a similar fashion.  Suchmedicinals include  steroids, narcotic antagonists,  localanesthetics, growth factors,  anti-cancer agents, and  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.The microsphere application comprises two basic units: A drugcontainer or vial that contains microspheres, and a unit thatgenerates the nebulizing gas stream required to spray or propelmicrospheres contained in vial (ital.???) onto the area to betreated.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Oscillator ChangespH to Release DrugScientists at the Ciba-Geigy Corp.

Only the uncharged form of a drug can cross overlipophilic membranes.  This device changes the pH of a solution tocharge or uncharge a drug.  In this way, the release of a drug canbe controlled.  An advantage of this system is that it does notrequire external power sources or electronic controllers. For thestudy, the scientists used a mixed Landoldt pH oscillator to studydiffusion of nicotine or benzoic acid across a membrane.Steven A. Giannos, S.M. Dinh, and B. Berner of the Ciba-Geigy Corp.published "Temporally Controlled Drug Delivery Systems:  Couplingof pH Oscillators with Membrane Diffusion" in the Journal ofPharmaceutical Sciences [84(5), 539-543, 1995].Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Probes DeliverDrugs to EyesDrugs are unable to perfuse well from the blood into the eye, anddoctors must give patients very large amounts of systemicmedications in order to treat eye diseases.  With certain drugs,such high concentrations in the body increase the risk of toxiceffects.  Scientists are trying to develop polymer devices that candeliver drugs directly into the eye.  In this study, polycarbonateand polyamide membranes were investigated for suitability.Three classes of drugs were studied for their ability to perfusefrom the microdialysis membranes:  antibiotics, corticosteroids,and cytostatic agents.  In addition, substances of varyingmolecular weights were studied.  Earlier studies had shown thatsome lipophilic drugs stick to polycarbonate polymer devices, butthis study did not reveal any differences between the two polymers.All the study substances dialyzed through the implantedmicrodialysis membranes.  The shape of the probe was found toaffect its dialyzing action.J. Waga and B.

The patent,"Method and Apparatus for Sensing Flow in Two Directions andAutomatic Calibration Thereof," further strengthens Aradigm'spatent portfolio, which protects methods and systems for efficientand consistent delivery of a broad range of drugs.Aradigm's microprocessor-controlled devices are capable of makingprecise quantitative measurements of a patient's inspiratory flowrate and volume in order to deliver consistent doses of aerosolizedmedication to the lungs.  The system's flow sensors measure apatient's inhalation characteristics and send digital signals to amicroprocessor, which selects the appropriate point toautomatically release an aerosolized drug dose for treatment ofrespiratory disease or for systemic effect.Aradigm is developing two aerosol drug-delivery platforms.  Thehandheld, microprocessor-controlled devices are intended to deliverreproducible doses of wide range of small and macromolecular drugs.The SmartMist Asthma Management System was designed to deliver moreconsistent doses of aerosol medications from standard metered-doseinhaler canisters.

CongressPkwy., Chicago, IL 60612; Tel: 312/942-5000) and the trial'sprincipal investigator, announced the beginning of the study withrepresentatives from G.A. Searle Inc. (5200 Old Orchard Road,Skokie, IL 60077; Tel:708/470-6728).Cover-HS, the calcium channel blocker to be used in the Searle-sponsored trial, incorporates a novel, controlled-onset, extended-release COER-24 delivery system and is currently under review bythe FDA for treatment of hypertension and angina.Taken at bedtime, Covera-HS is designed to lower blood pressure byreleasing active drugs in concert with the body's natural circadianrhythms.  Since blood pressure commonly follows a circadianpattern, dropping at night and rising in early morning, Covera-HS'COER-24 delivery system was developed to deliver peakconcentrations of the drug when blood pressure tends to be highest-- in the hours just before and after awakening."We know that as blood pressure rises, risk of suffering myocardialinfarction is generally highest within the six-hour period afterwaking," Black explained.  "This large-scale trial will determinewhether treatment with Covera-HS, which delivers higher dosages ofcalcium channel blocker at time of greatest risk, will beequivalent to standard of care in decreasing risk of fatal and non-fatal heart attack and stroke in patients with mild to moderatehypertension," he said."This study could provide substantial new information on how weshould manage hypertension and perhaps change our way of thinkingwith respect to which antihypertensives should be used and when,"he said.In addition to primary endpoint, the trial will look for treatmentdifferences in other endpoints associated with hypertension, suchas death from any cause and the development of congestive heartfailure requiring hospitalization.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Patch Alternative toHormone ReplacementSmithKline Beecham (1 Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, PA 19101; Tel:215/751-4000) and Theratech Inc.

Adroderm is atreatment for men suffering from hypogonadism, a condition in whichthe body produces insufficient levels of testosterone.  Theproduct, available only by a doctor's prescription, was cleared formarketing by the FDA.Only about five percent of the estimated four to five millionAmerican men of all ages with hypogonadism currently receivetestosterone-replacement therapy (TRT). "The currently availablechoices given hypogonadal men in need of testosterone-replacementtherapy have been less than ideal," said Daniel Tasse, vicepresident and director, endocrine and oncology products, SmithKlineBeecham. "Androderm will fill a distinct need in the area ofhormone-replacement therapy for men."Overall, treatment with Androderm resulted in normalization ofmorning testosterone levels in 92% of the 94 patients who completedthe trials.

Whisman Road, Mountain View, CA94093; Tel: 415/903-9100) received FDA market clearance for its twoPyrilinks urine-based assays that provide a quantitative measure ofexcretion of pyridinium crosslinks as a indicator of type Icollagen resorption, especially bone collagen.  This providesmeasurement of bone-collagen breakdown, which, when elevated, leadsto bone loss.Bone is made up of a complex collagen matrix that is constantlybuilt up by cells called osteoblasts and broken down by cellscalled osteoclasts.  In this process of bone turnover, osteoclastsrelease pyridinium crosslinks (Pyd and Dpd) into urine that can bequantitatively measured by Pyrilinks assays.Alkphase-B, another Metra test previously cleared by the FDA,measures alkaline phosphatase, a by-product of osteoblasts presentin blood.  When the rate of bone breakdown (loss) exceeds rate offormation, total bone mass decreases.Currently there are no commercially available products to rebuildbone once it is lost.  For this reason, in diseases likeosteoporosis, it is exceedingly important to identify individualsat risk and to act early and definitively.  Bone loss can becontrolled through use of a number of therapies including hormonereplacement, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin.Pyrilinks values reflect level of bone-collagen loss as impacted bysuch factors as low estrogen production, low calcium intake, lowphysical activity, or diseases known to affect bone metabolism suchas osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism,hyperthyroidism, and bone metastases.  As with all diagnostictests, Pyrilinks results should be interpreted in conjunction withclinical findings and other diagnostic results. As the FDA hasstated, markers like Pyrilinks are needed if anti-resorptivetherapies -- such as those used to fight osteoporosis -- are toincrease in use and be used successfully," said George W. Dunbar,president and CEO of Metra Biosystems.Metra Biosystems has developed a panel of six biochemical bonemarkers to help physicians more precisely assess a patient's boneturnover.  Bone metabolism normally stays in careful balance,maintaining healthy, strong bones.  Prolagen-C and NovoCalcinassess bone and collagen formation.  Pyrilinks-D (currently underreview by the FDA), NovoCalcin, and Prolagen-C are available forresearch use in the U.S. Metra's panel is available for clinicaluse abroad.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Heart AttacksDiagnosed at BedsideBoehringer Mannheim Diagnostics (9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN46250; Tel: 317/576-3914) received marketing clearance from the FDAfor a new rapid bedside assay that helps physicians diagnosemyocardial infarction.  The easy-to-use assay is based on thecompany's proprietary marker--cardiac troponin T. It is locatedinside cardiac muscle and is released into blood only when cellsare damaged.  In the U.S., Boehringer Mannheim has marketed anELISA version of the assay on its ES 300 immunoassay system sinceJune 1994.The Cardiac T Rapid Assay is a self-contained, disposable unitapproximately four inches long, less than an inch wide, and only aquarter of an inch thick.  Drops of blood are placed in a well onthe device and are quickly drawn into a sandwich assay impregnatedwith two distinct types of monoclonal antibodies that link tocardiac troponin T in the sample, resulting in a visible colorchange.  A red control line appears to verify that the test isworking properly, and if the sample contains cardiac troponin T, asecond red line appears to alert the physician, nurse, orlaboratory specialist.Meanwhile, researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital reportedthat elevated levels of Cardiac Specific Troponin-I predict anincreased mortality risk and may play a role in identifyingpatients appropriate for early invasive treatment.  The study isthe largest to investigate the role of Cardiac Specific Troponin-Iin predicting mortality risk.Investigators examined multiple blood specimens from 1,470 patientswith unstable angina who were enrolled in the National Institute ofHealth's Thrombolytic and Myocardial Infarction Study (TIMI-IIIB).Cardiac Specific Troponin-I was measured to identify those patientsappropriate for early invasive therapy, such as earlycatheterization and revascularization.Results indicated that Cardiac Specific Troponin-I levels greaterthan 0.4 ng/ml predicted a significantly increased mortality by 42days.  Conversely, Cardiac Specific Troponin-I levels less than 0.4ng/ml were predictive of a low risk of mortality.  The study foundthat for every ng/ml elevation of cardiac troponin-I, a patient'smortality risk increased 10%. Patients with an elevated cardiactroponin-I level experienced a significantly improved survival ratewhen they underwent an early invasive versus a conservativestrategy."For the first time, a blood test is available that identifiespatients with unstable angina who are an increased risk ofmortality," said Dr. Elliot Antman, lead investigator of the study,director of Coronary Care, and associate professor of medicine atBrigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School (25Shattuck Ave., Boston, MA 02115; Tel: 617/495-1000).Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Simultaneous Assay forChlamydia, GonorrheaGen-Probe Inc. (9880 Campus Point Drive, San Diego, CA 92121-1589;Tel: 619/546-8000) now markets PACE 2C, a new version of the PACE2 assay for simultaneous diagnosis of the two most common sexuallytransmitted diseases in the U.S.  PACE 2 and PACE 2C detect thepresence of ribosomal RNA for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseriagonorrhoeae, the organisms responsible for chlamydia and gonorrheainfections.According to Craig S. Hill, manager of scientific affairs at Gen-Probe, infection with both diseases simultaneously is "quitecommon"; as many as 50% of patients who have gonorrhea infectionsare also infected with chlamydia.  The PACE 2 and PACE 2C assaysoffer the advantage of diagnosing both infections as part of thesame procedure. Traditional laboratory tests for gonorrhea requirea bacterial culture, while chlamydia detection relies on cellculture.  Both methods have limitations not experienced with thePACE 2 and PACE 2C assays.  Immunoassays have also been used todetect these sexually transmitted diseases, but they cannot detectthe presence of both infections in a single sample or assay.First introduced in 1990, the PACE 2 assay relies on DNA probesthat are labeled with acridinium ester, which can detect theribosomal RNA of the disease organisms.  One sample from thepatient is all that is needed to test for both organisms.  If thedisease organism is present, the DNA probes hybridize to the targetribosomal RNA, and the results can be obtained within 2.5 hours bymeasuring the signal (measured in relative light units).According to Hill, the PACE 2 assay is "the most widely usednonculture [chlamydia and gonorrhea] assay in the U.S."  The PACE2C assay can detect the disease organisms from a single sample, aswell as in a single test tube.  If a positive signal results fromthis assay, a second assay can determine which of the organisms ispresent.In one investigation, sensitivity of the PACE 2C assay was 96.3%,while specificity was 98.8%.  Sensitivity and specificity of thePACE 2 assay for chlamydia are 93% and 99%, respectively.  Thesensitivity and specificity of the PACE 2 assay for gonorrhea are95% and 99%, respectively.  By comparison, the sensitivity ofculture methods may be as low as 88.9%.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Hepatitis SerotypingTest LaunchedInternational Murex Technologies (3075 Northwoods Circle, Norcross,GA 30071; Tel: 770/662-0660) has commercialized its second-generation assay for serological genotyping of Hepatitis C (HCV).The Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) assay is a simple, enzymeimmunoassay that identifies whether a patient is infected with HCVtypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  This second-generation test is the onlycommercial assay to cover HCV types 1-6, according to the company.The test will initially be marketed to clinicians and research,clinical, and private laboratories outside the United States.  Theproduct has already been registered for in vitro diagnostic use inFrance.Murex launched its first-generation serotyping test identifyingtypes 1, 2, and 3 in November 1994.  Prior to that introduction,HCV typing was restricted to certain laboratories where genotypingcould be performed by complex, laborious procedures involving DNAamplification technology.  This seriously limited investigationsinto the disease.  In contrast, the Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) testis suitable for use in any laboratory as no specialist skills orfacilities are required.The launch of Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) test will now allowmeaningful research into significance of different HCV types andwill greatly assist in development of appropriate patient-management strategies. HCV type is a key factor in determiningpatient response to antiviral therapy; it is critical to determineHCV type so that the patient may receive the most appropriatetherapy.The Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) test utilizes synthetic peptidesrepresenting variable antigenic regions from NS4 of HCV types 1through 6.  Differential response of patient antibodies to theseregions of NS4 enables the test to identify HCV types in infectedpatients.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Bladder CancerTest AvailableMaritech Inc.

Another Panel hearing will not be necessary, but thecompany must provide these data in order to obtain approval tomarket from the FDA.Maritech is presently studying the FDA's request for additionaldata in order to provide it as promptly as possible.  NMP22 is thefirst Nuclear Matrix Protein-based diagnostic product to bereviewed by the FDA for sale in the U.S.Now being sold in Europe, the "Matritech NMP22 Test Kit" is twiceas sensitive as urine cytology and is a painless, low-cost, highlyaccurate tool for management of transitional cell carcinoma of theurinary tract (TCC/UT), which accounts for more than 90% of bladdercancer.The Maritech NMP22 Test Kit's enabling technology is based on afundamental breakthrough in cell biology discovered at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where researchersfound that nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) in cancer cells differfrom those in normal cells.  MIT obtained patents covering the useof NMPs to detect cancer and licensed their discovery worldwide,exclusively, to Matritech.While Lamm anticipates that other urologists will embrace a moreaccurate and painless alternative to current testing options, theyalso noted that Matritech's urine assay will offer patientssignificant savings.  For example, invasive cystoscopy often costsabout $300.

Thereare fears that these adhered components generate a thrombus on asurface of a membrane coming into contact with blood and that thecomponents affect a complement. As a result, formation of athrombus or reduction of an immunity function is presumed to becaused.Various attempts to solve these difficulties have been made. Insynthesizing a hydrophilic copolymer containing a polyalkyleneoxide chain, copolymerized with an acrylic or methacrylic ester,the content of polyalkylene oxide in the copolymer can be too high,and there is a problem that the synthesized copolymer becomes a gelin spite of the kind of the acrylic or methacrylic ester used. Thegel can hardly be dissolved in a solvent. In such a case, it cannotbe used as a coating material and cannot be formed as a fiber or amembrane.Even if the content of polyalkylene oxide is low, a satisfactoryanti-fouling property and antithrombotic property have not beendemonstrated. In research to improve the gel structure, a polymerthat can be easily dissolved in a solvent with a high water contentand a high affinity with acrylic ester or methacrylic ester wassynthesized by copolymerizing an acrylic ester or methacrylicester, polyalkylene oxide, and another copolymerizable component.The material developed is characterized as a copolymer composed ofa monomer with a polyalkylene oxide unit and a polymerizablecarbon-carbon double bond in its molecule, a methacrylic estermonomer or an acrylic ester monomer, and a monomer with apolymerizable carbon-carbon double bond other than the first twomonomers. The content of the monomer is not less than 5% by weightand not more than 90% by weight.The hydrophilic material can be dissolved in a solvent and hasexcellent antithrombotic and anti-fouling properties and providesan antithrombotic semipermeable membrane. These materials can beappropriately used in the medical field and as water-absorbent andanti-fouling materials.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Medtronic ExpandsNeurological BusinessMedtronics (7000 Central Ave., Minneapolis, MN 55432; Tel: 612/574-4000) signed an agreement to acquire Micro Interventional Systems(680 Maud Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94086; Tel: 408/481-4900).

Examples of reusable devices includeendoscopes and surgical instruments, which often do not havedirections and labeling for proper reuse.Furthermore, although disposable devices such as dialyzers andcatheters are intended for single use, they are often reprocessedwithout labeling or directions for safe reuse by manufacturers.Therefore, there are two issues involved in the reuse of medicaldevices: reusables and disposables.According to some medical trade associations, the FDA has not beenable to establish a consistent reuse policy even though the agencytakes the position that device reuse is a potential safety problem.Medical device industry associations also state that the FDA hasshifted responsibility for safe reuse to medical devicemanufacturers rather than health-care providers.  Only recently hasthe FDA provided guidance on how to label products for reuse.A key ingredient of the FDA's policy on reuse labeling requires any510(k) notice to contain a certificate of validation. Although theresponsibility for medical device reuse is still not clear, the FDAappears to be getting tougher with service organizations thatassist hospitals in reprocessing.  But the agency still is notwilling to directly regulate health-care facilities.The general consensus is that the FDA will continue to applypressure to manufacturers to justify and validate reuse of theirdevices despite their single-use labeling. A critical questionremains as to whether the FDA's position will be upheld inlitigation or lead to voluntary compliance by industry.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Artificial Nose MayHave Medical ApplicationsBy mimicking the impressive ability of the human nose to pick asingle odor out of a million, Tufts University (419 Boston Ave.,Medford, MA 02155; Tel: 617/627-3250) researchers David Walt andJohn Kauer have invented a fiber optic and computer "nose" that canidentify many substances by their smells.One of many potential uses for an artificial nose includes"detecting the signature odor of a human being, which can be usednot just for identification but also for diagnostic purposes.  Wemay be able to test breath and sweat odors to detect diseases thatalter metabolism," said Kauer, professor of neuroscience andanatomy and cellular biology at Tufts School of Medicine. "Smell isthe most sensitive, most flexible way to do chemical testing," saidWalt, professor and chairman of chemistry at Tufts.Cells inside the nose house millions of receptors that sendmessages to the olfactory bulb, a pea-sized structure between theeyes.  The olfactory bulb pares these messages down to a fewthousand, which it relays to the brain.A chemical sensor works in the following manner.  A hair-thin glassfiber is tipped with chemical A, a combination of a polymer and adye, which is known to react with chemical B.  The fiber is exposedto the substance to be tested.  A light beam travels down thefiber, hits chemical A (if it's there), and bounces back.  Acomputer analyzes the light for changes in color and intensity thatwould occur if chemical A encountered chemical B.  Like litmuspaper that turns a brighter red in presence of increasing amountsof acid, behavior of light tells chemists how much of chemical B,if any, is present.While Walt's optical sensors have proved useful for variousmedical, environmental, and chemical testing processes, "you need100 sensors to detect 100 substances," he said. However, "if youbuilt a system based on olfactory principles, then one sensingsystem would detect many different odors," Kauer said.  "Therewould be an array of sensors where each one is cross-reactive --each one responds to some degree to some compounds and to somedegree to others -- to create patterns across the array."Using Walt's knowledge of sensors and Kauer's knowledge ofneurological networks, they created a device -- for which theyreceived a patent -- that can tell the difference between alcoholsthat differ by one carbon atom and can identify five-carbon estersthat smell like bananas.  In other words, their invention is, insome cases, almost as good as a well-trained human nose.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Imaging SystemsGo to JapanPolaroid Corp.

Global Loop, Tucson, AZ 85706; Tel: 520/746-1234, Fax:520/294-3300, E-mail: opc_info@ix.netcom.com) in a new, gas-basedmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure that may detectemphysema, asthma, pulmonary embolisms, and other lung diseasesthat have been difficult or impossible to diagnose withconventional proton MRI.  Employing this experimental "laser-polarized" gas MRI method, physicists at Princeton University andscientists with Duke University's Center for In Vivo Microscopyacquired the first high-resolution images of a human lung, reportsOPC's Merrill Apter.Since they are filled with air and not water, a human lung isdifficult to image effectively using proton MRI because it lacksthe necessary hydrogen atoms to produce a resolute picture.  Whilex-rays of the lungs can show some accumulation of fluid and scartissue, their exposures are too short to reveal porous lung tissue.Other diagnostic procedures for imaging the lungs, such asventilation scans with radioactive isotopes, expose the patient tosignificant levels of radiation and often fail to producesufficiently high-resolution images.  The noble gases used in thelaser-polarized gas MRI technique--usually helium (He) or xenon(Xe)--are inert and nonradioactive and therefore are harmlessinhalants, posing no health risk to the patient.Tuned to 795 nm, the diode laser stimulates an atomic transition inthe alkali metal rubidium (Rb), which is driven into a vapor in asmall oven heated to about 180C.  The Rb vapor becomes polarizedin the process and subsequently transfers some of the polarizationto the nuclei of 3He or 129Xe during gas-phase collisions in a 50-100 cc sealed cell.  After sufficient polarization is generated inthe noble gas, it can be cooled to room temperature (condensing therubidium vapor) and inhaled into the lungs for imaging.Physicist Hunter Middleton of Princeton University (223 JadwinHall, Princeton, NJ 08544; Tel: 609/258-2843, Fax: 609/258-1124, E-mail: midleton@princeton.edu) describes how the research teamrelies on intense light from OPC's high-power diode lasers toproduce the required volumes of polarized gas.  "The highlypolarized state of the noble gas allows images taken with the newMRI technique to be generated in seconds, compared to the minutesoften required for conventional MRIs," says Middleton.  When theproject began they were using five sets of large titanium:sapphirelaser systems pumped by argon ion lasers to achieve the requiredlevels of polarization, but those lasers were found to be tooexpensive and inefficient.Turning to diode lasers, they were able to dramatically lower theiroperating costs. The compact 20 W open-heatsink diode laserinitially employed in the new MRI technique was priced at about$4,000 and used less than 80 W of electrical input power.  Bycomparison, the argon ion and titanium:sapphire lasers togetherwere priced in the neighborhood of $500,000 and used about 250 kWof electricity to produce the same output power. "Thetitanium:sapphire setup was so big it required a separate room,"explains Middleton.  "The diode laser array, on the other hand, isso small and efficient that it allows us to move the laser-polarized gas MRI station easily from the laboratory to a hospitalenvironment equipped with only a standard 110 v wall outlet."The 20 W array was more than adequate for imaging the lungs of aguinea pig, but couldn't produce enough polarized gas necessary forhuman tests.  For the first test of a human lung, a 120 W arrayproduced nearly 1 liter of polarized gas in four hours.  "Thoughthe spectral distribution, or emission bandwidth, of the diodelaser array (about 2.5 nm) is much broader than that oftitanium:sapphire lasers and exceeds the absorption line of therubidium as well, it's nevertheless extremely efficient in thisapplication," says Middleton.  "We believe that imaging thefunction of the lungs and other organs and tissues filled with airspaces using laser-polarized gas has vast potential and may evolveinto a nice complement to conventional proton MRI."Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Syringe PreventsSelf-PunctureMedisys Technologies Inc.

TheFDA approved all aortic and mitral versions of the product.  Giventhis approval, the SJM Masters Series valve will soon be availableto all U.S. customers.  The product has been available in Europesince March 1995, with positive market reaction.The SJM Masters Series valve is a system of enhancements of the St.Jude Medical Mechanical Heart Valve, the industry's most preferredheart valve, with more than 600,000 implants worldwide.  The SJMMaster Series valve was developed in consultation with more than200 physicians and surgeons.The product can be rotated for optimum valve-leaflet position afterit is sutured in place, providing additional flexibility for thosesurgeons who desire rotatability.  It is also MRI compatible andradiopaque for improved post-implant diagnostic capability featuresrequested by some surgeons.Initial European implants of the SJM Masters Series valve occurredin March, and the aortic version of the valve was awarded the CEMark in September.  To date, there have been more than 1,500implants of the SJM Masters Series valves in Europe and Canada.The company submitted a premarket approval (PMA) supplement to theFDA for U.S. market approval in May 1995.  This FDA approval is theculmination of a year-long rollout of this product by the company'sheart-valve division.Commenting on FDA approval of the SJM Masters Series valve, TerryL.

Theearliest models developed more than 20 years ago were quitecumbersome, keeping patients tethered to large external pumps andtheir pneumatic power systems.  Recent technology advances haveyielded a portable, battery-powered version, its power source wornon a belt or shoulder holster.The LVAD used at Columbia-Presbyterian is the vented electricThermo Cardiosystems HeartMate.  About four inches in diameter,less than two inches thick, and weighing about one and a halfpounds, the pump is implanted in the abdomen.  It is attached tothe heart and receives and pumps blood into the circulation,leaving the natural heart in place to perform other importantfunctions.A cable from the pump extends out of the body and is connected toa battery pack.  With proper care, this connection can bemaintained for long periods without infection. After discharge,patients and their caregivers must provide simple maintenance forthe LVAD, including changing the battery pack every six to eighthours, changing dressings daily around the cable exit, and keepingit dry.A major advance of these new LVADs is a textured internal surfacethat reduces likelihood of blood clots that can lead to strokes, aserious problem in earlier devices.  No anti-coagulation medicationother than aspirin is needed. No deaths, serious devicemalfunctions, or infections have occurred among dischargedpatients.  All have been able to maintain their LVADS safely.Currently, LVADs are FDA-approved only as a "bridge to transplant";i.e. they are implanted in people who are awaiting a donor heartbut who suddenly decompensate and cannot survive without extrapumping help. Until recently, LVAD patients had to remain in thehospital, waiting an average of three months for transplantation.However, advances enabled Columbia-Presbyterian physicians todischarge seven patients to await transplantation more comfortably-- and far less expensively than in an intensive care unit -- athome.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEDICAL MATERIALS UPDATE via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CALENDARFebruary 1-2, 1996, HIMA Sterilization Workshop, Costa Mesa, CA.Contact: Health Industry Manufacturers Association, WashingtonD.C.; Tel: 202/434-7238.February 6-7, 1996, Implementation of Quality Systems for theMedical Device Industry, Anaheim, CA.

Cass Ave., Suite 107, Darien, IL 60561; Tel: 708/963-0320,Fax: 708/963-0381) has metal-ion specificity that enables it toremove radionuclides and metals selectively from aqueous solutions.This high-performance, gel-type cation resin displays exceptionalionic selectivity, tremendous capacity, and a rapid rate ofcomplexation.  The selectivity, capacity, and exchange kinetics ofthe Eichrom resin allows performance enhancements in an array ofapplications where selective separation is important.In contrast to other commercially available ion-exchange resins,Eichrom's Diphonix resin is polyfunctional, with two distinctfunctional groups.  Each of these groups contributes to the resin'sperformance.  The Diphonix resin is constructed of apolystyrene/divinylbenzene matrix in a spherical bead form (in atightly controlled size range).Chemically bonded to the polymer matrix are diphosphonic andsulfonic acid groups.  The primary exchange group is geminallysubstituted diphosphonic acid (with a content of 1.2-1.6 mmol ofphosphorus per dry gram of resin).  These unique ligands formextremely stable complexes with a number of metal ions and areresponsible the Diphonix resin's metal ion specificity.Incorporated into the matrix at the time of polymerization, thediphosphonic acid functional group is physically stable over a widerange of thermal and chemical conditions.Resin activity is exceptional in acidic solutions where theDiphonix resin's contains complexed metals under conditions thatfor most ion exchangers would effect the resin regeneration.  Thediphosphonic acid ligand retains metals effectively at pH values of2 and under, conditions that many resins would see as regenerating.The resin can remove trace metals from acid solutions used in thesemiconductor industry for product washing and etching, allowingthe reuse of the solutions.The secondary exchange sites in the Diphonix resin are comprised ofsulfonic acid groups.  Contained with the polymer matrix, theseligands make the resin very hydrophobic.  As a result, they enhancemetal ion accessibility into the polymer network and significantlyimprove the ion-exchange kinetics of the Diphonix resins.The Diphonix ion-exchange resin is ideally suited forultrapurification, metallurgical processing applications, treatmentof radioactive effluents, industrial wastewater treatment, andenvironmental remediation.  In these applications, the resinpreferentially interacts with metal ions in liquid solutions,providing a cost-effective way of removing metals from process orwaste solutions.  Metal selectivity is maintained even in thepresence of a high concentration of competing cations, such assodium, calcium, and magnesium.  The Diphonix resin reduces themetal concentrations to the level required, while rejectingunregulated ions (i.e., the competing cations).  Metals can beextracted via ion exchange instead of by alkaline precipitation.By utilizing a bed of Diphonix resin, a sidestream arrangement,contaminant residuals in process streams can be controlled.Diphonix resin shows exceptional selectivity for a number ofradionuclide species.  In nuclear power plants, contaminatedradwaste can be treated at a reduced cost compared to conventionalion-exchange resins.  The Diphonix resin's capacity is not spent onnon-regulated species.  Additionally, in soil or water remediation,the resin's high reactivity achieves removal to the lowest possibleconcentration.The resin's preference for metal ions makes the effective capacityfor metals higher than non-selective cation resins.  On a totalexchange basis, the capacity compares with non-selective resins ofsimilar crosslink percentage.  Capacity values for all resin forms(determined by bead size and percent crosslinkage) are availablefrom Eichrom.  The firm offers the Diphonix resin in a variety ofbead sizes and crosslinkage percentages that suit a number oflaboratory and process applications.The Diphonix resin is the result of breakthrough technologiesdeveloped by Argonne National Laboratory and the University ofTennessee, where Spiro D. Alexandratos determined thatbifunctionality and intra-ligand cooperation played important rolesin ensuring metal ion selectivity when phosphorus acid ligands werecovalently bonded to polystyrene beads.Building upon this technological base, Eichrom has developed asignificant array of new products that stem from three innovativecore technologies:  Selective ion-exchange resins, extractionchromatographic resins, and specific extractants.  Sectors in whichEichrom is involved include the following:Increased productivity, waste minimization, and cost reduction forenvironmental laboratories;Extraction chromatographic resins for the selective separation ofradium, cesium, and tritium;Enhanced analysis and removal capabilities for actinides,strontium, and technetium;Separation of ultrapure isotopes for radiopharmaceuticalapplications; andAdvanced separations products for industrial and environmentalapplications, including ultrapure reagents, hydrometallurgy, andradioactive wastes.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996System Reuses 95% ofCopper Rinse WaterA water-recycling system from the Engineered Systems Division ofKinetico Inc. (10845 Kinsman Road, Newbury, OH 44065; Tel: 800/633-5530) will enable West Coast Circuits (Watsonville, CA) to recyclemore than 95% of the copper rinse waters used in its printedcircuit fabrication process.  The unique design of the 20- to 30-gpm system will produce high-purity deionized water that willimprove product quality and reduce water and sewer costs.Ion-exchange technology is used to recover heavy metals andminimize waste at West Coast Circuits facility, thereby reducingits cost of hauling the wastewater discharge off-site.  TheKinetico water-recycling system features countercurrent process toregenerate the ion-exchange resins used.  The process regeneratesthe resin columns with acid for the metal cations and caustic forthe anions injected from the opposite flow direction. This processdesign uses up to 50% fewer chemicals, produces less wasteregenerant, and utilizes resin capacity more effectively.The Kinetico division has also sold a Waste Minimization System toMotorola Semiconductors Hong Kong Ltd. (Taipo, Hong Kong), aninternational semiconductor manufacturer.  The system, whichcombines ion-exchange technology with electrowinning, will provideMotorola with high-purity water recycling, metal recovery, andwaste minimization.The two-part Kinetico system consists of a rinse-water recyclingsystem and a metal scavenging system.  The 60 gpm rinse-waterrecycling system will recycle rinse water from four Technic Platerlines.  It will also treat the dragout rinses after process stepsin the manufacturing of semiconductors.  This design will improveenvironmental performance, reduce water and sewer bills, and loweroperating costs.The 12 gpm metal-scavenging system selectively removes metals tolower discharge limits; therefore, minimal water treatment isneeded before discharge.  The system is integrated with a 25-square-foot electrolytic metal recovery system and waste-acidrecovery system to recover copper and tin/lead in metallic formfrom the dragout and flowing rinses.  This minimizes wastewaterflows to the existing treatment system and reduces the amount ofsludge produced, thereby lowering the waste-effluent quality.For more information on Kinetico systems and the firm's line ofdeionization, ion-exchange, electrowinning, and membrane systemsfor process and wastewater treatment, contact Teresa Saloka.Standard and custom systems are available for water recycling,metal recovery, and waste minimization.  These systems are idealfor applications in the metal finishing, electronics, printedcircuit board, semiconductor, groundwater remediation, and avariety of other industries.

(157 Concord Road, Billerica,MA 01821-7101; Tel: 508/663-3455) recovers metal and acid valuesfrom a metallic fluorides-containing source material.  Invented byRobert A. Hard and protected by U.S. Patent 5,437,848, the processdigests the source material in sulfuric acid.  This digestion formsa slurry that separates into two phases:A fluoride-containing solid phase; andA metal-containing first-liquid phase.Hard writes that subjecting the solid phase to pyrohydrolysisallows the recovery of sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids.The liquid phase is then processed, via solvent extraction or ionexchange, to recover the metal values.  A water-immiscible organicextractant, such as methylisobutyl ketone, extracts the tantalumvalues, and water strips it from the first organic phase.  Theprocess includes the additional steps of heating the separatedsolid phase from ambient to elevated temperatures, in the presenceof water vapor, to evolve sulfuric acid and render the ganguechemically inert.When the source material contains uranium, the digestion stepreduces the amount of gangue present in the radioactive source. Theprocess can include the additional steps of removing uranium fromthe liquid phase, by either an ion-exchange resin or by solventextraction.  This removal process also uses a water-immiscibleorganic extractant to yield a uranium-depleted aqueous phase thatcan be treated with an aqueous solution of calcium oxide.  Sulfuricacid and the organic extractant for extracting uranium can berecycled if desired.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Method PurifiesCrude ProteinsDavid Naveh and John C.

Thecrude protein mixture contains one or more undesirable proteins ofunknown isoelectric points.  Naveh and Tang use either computersimulation or isoelectric focusing gels to determine theisoelectric points of proteins in the crude protein mixture.The pH for the ion-exchange chromatography is adjusted to a pointbetween the ranges of isoelectric points of the protein fractionsto be separated.  Separation occurs when contact is made betweenthe ion-exchange resin and the crude protein mixture.  Since theproteins in the first and second fractions are oppositely charged,only one of the fractions binds to the ion-exchange resin.

Onegoal of the industry is dry-particulate filtration media withefficiencies that approach zero emissions.That goal moved closer to the realm of possibility with theintroduction of Nomex Delta Micro by E.I. Du Pont de Nemours andCo. (1007 Market St., Wilmington, DE 19898; Tel: 302/774-1000). Theproduct combines high separation efficiency with low differentialpressure.  This combination results in significantly improvedsurface filtration and reduced operating costs.Based on the Du Pont's well-known Nomex fiber technology, NomexDelta Micro filters are composed of high-temperature-resistantmeta-aramid fibers.  The fibers measure only 0.78 dtex and have a69% greater surface area than the 2.2 dtex aramid fibers used inconventional aramid fibers.  These attributes enable users toproduce microporous needlefelts with more density and excellentsurface-filtration properties.Most importantly, especially in filter cleaning and recoveringvaluable production elements, the dense micropore filter surfaceretains a greater proportion of dust particles than conventionalfilters.  The microporous fleece structure of Nomex Delta Microfilters causes the initial dust-cake phase to build up moreeffectively.  Additionally, the structure prevents the dust-particle penetration common to felts with larger, more open pores.Launched worldwide, Nomex Delta Micro filters meet the new GermanVDI Guideline 3926 that evaluates cleanable filter media.  Long-term filtration behavior tests confirm that the dust-leakage valuesof the new filters are significantly better than with standardNomex fibers or with other meta-aramid filter felts. The tests alsoreveal that emission reductions with the Nomex Delta Micro filtersare comparable to (equivalent with) higher-priced laminatedfilters.Laboratory tests show that the new technology has a lower pressure-drop value than standard filter felts.  DuPont reports that thehigher air-to-cloth capability of needlefelts composed of NomexDelta Micro filters allows more flue gas per square meter of feltsurface to be treated.  Therefore, the firm states that users needto clean the filters less frequently. Another added benefit is thatthe filters could make smaller, less expensive ventilation systemsfeasible.  The lightweight capability of the ultrafine fibers couldpotentially lead to reduced operating costs, without any loss anyfiltration efficiency.Du Pont  notes that the chemical resistance of filter feltscomposed of the new fibers equals or excels that of standard (2.2dtex) Nomex filter felts.  Both the standard and the new Nomexfilters perform well mechanically and demonstrate dimensionalstability at operating temperatures up to 200oC.  They provide anextensive safety margin for temperature surges.Information on Nomex Delta Micro may be obtained from Fleet Smith(Tel: 302/999-3419), Nomex marketing manager for Du Pont.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Osmonics HoldingMore of the DirtIncreased dirt-holding capacity (DHC) or contaminant loading offilters has been a continuous goal of filter manufacturers and acontinuous desire of filter users.  This is because increased DHCresults in more economical filtration.  However, it is difficult toachieve higher DHC without compromising the efficiency of thefilter.Most filter manufacturers have devised increasing DHC by improvingthe filter media.  The amount any filter medium can hold isdirectly proportional to the void volume or open area in the media.Over the years, millions of dollars have been spent on developingmedia that will hold more contaminant.  It is a difficult taskbecause in any given medium, if you increase the void volume, youdecrease contaminant-removal efficiency.To increase DNC without compromising removal efficiency,manufacturers have altered the structure of the media.  Despiteusing finer fibers, greater loft, more entanglement, and multiplelayers, or by forming asymmetric pores and creating greater poredensity, filter media manufacturers have been able to achieve onlymodest increases in DNC.Spiraltek rolled-cartridge filters from Osmonics (5951 ClearwaterDrive, Minnetonka, MN  55343;  Tel: 612/933-2277,  Fax: 612/933-0141) represent a new concept in filtration.  The filter wasdeveloped using a knowledge of crossflow technology.  In crossflowfiltration, the media is continuously cleaned by the process fluidthat flows across the media surface.  The fluid flow ismechanically restricted downstream, such that a portion of the flowpasses through the media, while the remainder passes beyond therestriction. The portion that did not go through the media containsa concentrated level of contaminant.Spiraltek filters employ the basics of crossflow filtration, butthe downstream restriction is entirely closed.  The result is afluid flow that continuously cleans the media surface without asecondary stream containing concentrated contaminant.  Ascontaminant is pushed towards the sealed end of the filter, thecontaminant packs against itself in a non-porous section of thefilter.  Restriction to flow increases very slowly, and the filteroperates steadily for a longer period of time.  The end result isless dependence on the void volume of the media for increased DNCand a quantum increase in DNC based on the filter construction.The new filters have been successfully applied in the field, andsubjected to unbiased, head-to-head comparison testing.  Testresults show that Spiraltek filters hold three to six times morecontaminant per square foot of filter media when compared to otherpleated filters.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Akzo Nobel Sells50%  JV InterestAkzo Nobel nv (Zeperweg 76, Arnhem, Gelderland 6800 SB,Netherlands; Tel: 085-66-4433) has transferred its 50% share in thecompanies Glucona VoF (the Netherlands) and Glucona America to itsjoint venture (JV) partner, AVEBE.

John J. Meakam Jr. (3696 Haven Ave., Redwood City, CA94063; Tel: 415/366-2626, Fax: 415/365-6490) cites large close-outsales of an older version of its Take-Off product as a reason forits 1995 third-quarter revenues ($3,057,000) being slightly lowerthan its 1994 third-quarter revenues ($3,398,000). During the thirdquarter of 1994, APS replaced its Take-Off make-up remover with anupdated version that incorporated its Microsponge systems.  Close-out sales of the older version moved rapidly and created a slightjump in 1994 third-quarter sales.Meakam attributes the decrease in revenues to low sales ofunlicensed suncare products, which do not include AdvancedPolymer's delivery-system technology.  Licensing revenues for thethird quarter were down, primarily due to variations in the timingof payments from Ortho Pharmaceuticals.  However, licensingrevenues were up for the first nine months of 1995 ($12,939,000)compared to the same period in 1994 ($12,870,000).Even though APS has experienced overall revenue decreases in the1995 third quarter, Meakam adds that "it is important to note thatrevenues from products that incorporate our delivery-systemstechnology were up 36% for the quarter.  This growth was due toincreased sales of established products and the introduction of newproducts.  Most notably, third-quarter 1995 sales of the Exact lineof acne products were up 94% compared with the same period in 1994,due partly to the introduction of our four new Exact lineextensions."Operating expenses for the quarter were down 7% overall to lastyear.  Reduced spending for now-completed clinical studies of twoethical pharmaceutical products decreased R&D expenses by $725,000.At the same time, selling, marketing, advertising, and promotionexpenses for the quarter increased by $469,000 due to theintroduction of the Exact line extensions.To gain operating cash without diluting its stock, APS completedtwo financing arrangements, during the third quarter of 1995. Thefirm switched from current to long-term debt and raised extra cash.Certain assets and the operating cash flows of a subsidiary securethese loans.With its strong delivery system platforms and expanding technologyapplications, Meacham feels that APS is in a position to focus onopportunities that offer the greatest potential for increasingshareholder value (its stocks decreased to $0.12 in the thirdquarter 1995 from $0.17 in the same period of 1994).The firm's objective is to use its technology base to form newstrategic alliances and licensing agreements that offer thepotential to increase its commercial opportunities significantly,both in the near term and the long term.  Recent discussions withprospective partners has increased APS' appreciation for thebreadth of its technologies and the potential that lies ahead.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Partial Resolution ofEnflurane with TOTThe preparative resolution (asymmetric synthesis) of currentinhalation anesthetics (i.e. enflurane, halothane, and isoflurane)via inclusion complexes presents a challenge to researchers.  Thechallenge lies in the how to produce inclusion complexes of theanesthetics that consist of small, apolar molecules These moleculeslack the functional groups normally used for inclusion complexationor for attachment of a chiral auxiliary. Producing chiral-inclusioncompounds with inhalation anesthetics could offer pharmaceuticalcompanies a means of obtaining large amounts of enantiomericallypure (highly enriched) products.Toward this end, a multinational research effort between Israeliand German chemists, with funding coming from an Israeli-U.S.foundation grant and from German industries, has been working oncage-type clathrate-inclusion complexes.  The chemists believe thatenclathration may serve as a means of obtaining sufficientquantities of pure enantiomers, especially of the two kinds neededto conduct chiroptical and biological studies.  The availability ofsuch enantiomers could allow researchers to determine whether theyundergo a different metabolism, another problem that plaguesanesthesiology.Israeli chemists involved in the effort include Jallal M. Gnaim(The Institutes for Applied Research, Ben-Gurion University of theNegev, P.O. Box 653, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel) and Bernard S. Green(Dept. of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The School of Pharmacy, TheHebrew University of Jerusalem, P.O. Box 12065, Jerusalem 91120,Israel).  The two Germans, Volker Schurig and Heiko Grosenik, arechemists at the Institut fr Organishe Chemie, UniversittTbingen, Auf der Morgenselle 18, D 7400, Tbingen 1, Germany).The team's efforts have resulted in cage-type clathrate-inclusioncomplexes of tri-o-thymotide (TOT) that yield partial preparativeresolution of enflurane.  The partial preparative resolution occursafter a single crystallization step of TOT from solutions ofenflurane in 2,24-trimethylpentane.  Gas chromatography (a columncoated with polymeric chiral-phase Chirasil-Dex) reveals that thesingle crystals contain 38% ee of enflurane.  Furthercrystallization of TOT-enflurane clathrate crystals enhances the eelevel.  The chemists have found that, in some cases, the firstenantiomer eluted predominates, while, in other cases, theenantiomer eluted last predominates.To prepare the clathrates, the chemists obtained a solvent-free TOTby synthesizing and crystallizing a TOT-ethanol complex, which waswarmed to 130oC at 0.2 mm/g for 24 hours and recrystallized.  Theydissolved 0.2 g of the TOT in 1.0 ml of boiling enflurane and added9.0 ml of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (TMP).  Addition of the TMPfacilitated cage-type clathrate nucleation and lowered thesolution's density, in order to prevent the growing crystal fromfloating on top of the solution.  The team then filtered and slowcooled the complex, prior to filtering and washing the resultantcrystals with 1 ml of cold methanol.  This latter step yielded 0.08g of large, colorless cubic crystals with a TOT:enflurane ratio of2:1, with no TMP present.In Tetrahedron: Asymmetry [6(7), 1499-1502, 1995], the researchteam describes the TOT molecules as homochiral in each crystal;therefore, enclathration produces an enantiomerically enrichedenflurane.  Measurement of the TOT optical rotation occurs prior tofull racemization and once again if the concentration is sufficientto warrant it.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Activator Preparedfrom Snake VenomA method from Pentapharm AG (Buros: Engelgasse 109, Ch-4002, Basel,Switzerland; Tel: 061-312-9680, Fax: 061-311-2049) prepares aphospholipid-dependent prothrombin activator from the venom ofsnakes belonging to the Elapidae family.

The system consists of an activatedcarbon-adsorption unit with a minimum of two adsorber vessels and,if required, a liquid air-stripping or distillation unit.  Solvent-laden air passes through the adsorber vessel where its solventvapors are adsorbed by specially selected activated carbons.  Theamount and depth of activated carbon in the adsorber vessel isdetermined by the users' system requirements.The sequencing of adsorption and regeneration cycles is alternatedto ensure that each carbon adsorber is on-line for an equivalentperiod.  The result is a continuous and automatic processing ofsolvent-laden air.During the regeneration cycle of the VARA solvent recovery system,low-pressure steam strips the solvent vapors from the carbon.After the steam/solvent mixture is condensed and cooled, it passesthrough a decanter where the solvents and water separate byrelative solubilities and specific gravities into a water phase anda solvent phase.  Generally, water-insoluble solvents can be reuseddirectly.If required, water-soluble solvents and complex solvent blends arefurther separated, dehydrated and/or purified through liquiddistillation.  VARA offers complete extractive and azeotropicmulti-component distillation systems for the separation andpurification of solvent mixtures.  Depending upon customer andprocess requirements, these systems can be designed for eithercontinuous or batch operations.VARA's custom-designed units can handle solvent-laden air streamflows from 500 to 1,000,000 cfm.  Packaged vertical or horizontalsolvent recovery units handle 1,000 to 20,000 cfm.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Selective CoatedPowders for PSAOver the past 20 years, adsorptive gas separation, especially inpressure-swing adsorption (PSA), has been the focus of considerableresearch.  Many researchers believe that coated adsorbents wouldexpand the applicability of PSA to the separation of a wider rangeof gas mixtures.  Based on the premise that coated absorbentsenhance selectivity, R. van der Vaart and his cohorts at theUniversity of Twente (Faculty of Chemical Technology, P.O. Box 217,7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands) have taken a first step in thedevelopment of coated adsorbents for PSA.The scientists coated a dense cellulose acetate membrane on theouter surface of a porous tablet of compressed activated-carbonpowder.  A powdered Norit Americas (RB1) activated carbon waspressed to a diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm, usingbentonite as a binder.  The tablet was pyrolyzed at 1073 K in anitrogen atmosphere, and it was then dipped on side with a 14%cellulose acetate solution (from Eastman Kodak) in a DMF fromMerck.  The tablet's pores were blocked with a filler thatevaporated during the coating process.  The coated tablet was thendried in a pure nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature.Since permeability was found to be independent of pressure, theinvestigators concluded that a defect-free membrane was preparedand could be used in a limited test of their model.   They observeduptake times that corresponded to cycle times of kinetic PSAapplications. Preliminary calculations indicated that the coatedadsorbents show promising viability in these applications. Thescientists are conducting an extensive experimental program tosubstantiate their preliminary results.  The focus of that programis highly permeable silicone rubber coatings rather than the low-permeable cellulose acetate coatings.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Nonwovens AddMechanical StrengthSemipermeable membranes have no mechanical strength and need to besupported during the filtration process.  Support can be providedvia perforated tubes or channelled plates (i.e. porous, non-compressable support materials).  These types of support materialscome in the form of PVC or stainless steel tubes or plastic plates.The high pressures (e.g. 1-140 bar) often necessitated by theprocess mean that the distance between the holes or channels mustbe relatively large to retain the mechanical strength of suchsupport materials. A porous, non-compressable supporting layer isused between the semipermeable membrane and the supporting elementto provide a drainage layer.Produced by Freudenberg Nonwovens L.P. (20 Industrial Ave.,Chelmsford, MA 01824; Tel: 508/454-0461, Fax: 508/256-6214),Viledon nonwovens add mechanical strength and provide custom-madesupport and drainage layers for semipermeable membranes.  ViledonNonwovens meet the demands of industry by offering the followingadvantages:  high homogeneity and thus uniform porosity;  smooth surfaces;  no projecting fibers; and  good processability during the demanding membrane-coatingprocess;Used for reverse osmosis, microfiltration, and ultrafiltration,Viledon nonwovens are usually coated directly with the membranesolution.  When used in the various module systems, the nonwovenprovides direct support for the delicate membranes.  An equallyimportant factor is uniform distribution and drainage of thepermeate, for which the porous structure of the nonwoven isadvantageous.Viledon nonwovens are successfully employed plate, spiral-wound,and tubular configurations.  In the plate module, the permeatepasses through the membrane and is drained off in a drainage layeror in drainage channels.  In the spiral-wound module, a nonwovensheet is laminated on one side with the membrane and sealed at theedges to a second sheet, thereby forming a virtually continuous"bag."Especially for tubular modules, Viledon nonwovens meet high demandswith respect to rigidity and mechanical strength.  The nonwovensare initially welded to form a tube and them laminated on theinside with the membrane.  This tube is inserted into a perforatedmetal or plastic pressure tube, which provides the support.Marketing questions on Viledon nonwovens should be directed toShari Fowler-Hutchinson at Freudenberg's Chelmsford location.Technical requests should be directed to Volker Haendler (Tel: 011-49-6201-806319) at Carl Freudenberg Industrial Products (P.O.

(7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA 18195; Tel:610/481-4911) makes an oxygen (O2)-selective adsorbent with aporous substrate, such as carbon molecular sieve, activated carbon,carbon black, coal, or petroleum coke.  The substrate isimpregnated with an acidic solution and then dried.  The oxygenselective adsorbent, which is protected by U.S. Patent 5,447,557,can be used in a pressure-swing adsorption process for theseparation of oxygen from nitrogen, for example, in air.Another R&D effort at Air Products has resulted in U.S. Patent5,451,385 for a process that controls exhaust emissions frommethane-fueled internal combustion engines.  Developed by James G.Hansel et al, the process utilizes a crystalline zeolite to removenitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide from the exhaust emissions.The zeolite catalyst causes the carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,and oxygen in the exhaust gas to react with methane.The catalyst has a silicon-to-aluminum ratio of equal to or greaterthan about 2.5.  It is prepared by ion exchange of a non-acidsodium or ammonium form of crystalline zeolite with one or morecations selected from cobalt, nickel, iron, chromium, andmanganese.  The zeolite is exchanged with from 0.1 to about 15 wt% of the cation, based on the total weight of the exchangedzeolite.  The metal-exchanged zeolite is impregnated with from 0.1to 23 wt % alumina, based upon the total weight of the impregnatedmetal-exchanged zeolite.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Material CombinesCeramic and FibersWith a goal of becoming the largest "full line" supplier of high-temperature insulation products, the Carborundum Co. (Fibers Div.,P.O. Box 808, Niagara Falls, NY 14302; Tel: 716/278-2203, Fax:716/278-2440) is readying a panel version of its Excelfrax productline.  Other Excelfrax product forms, including Excelblok rigid-board insulation, are in the development stage.The developmental products, as well as the firm's commmercializedflexible blanket form called the Excelflex Composite Systems, arebased on Excelfrax's core high-temperature insulation material.This material blends ceramic (alumina and silica) powders andfibers to produce a microporous structure.  The structure decreasesradiant heat flow, thereby making Excelfrax materials extremelyefficient insulation materials.  The core material can bemanufactured into a variety of product forms, including compositesystems, molded shapes, and rigid boards.The firm's Excelflex Composite Systems are composed of a high-temperature (1800oF) core material that has been placed between twolayers of a high-temperature textile.  The standard textile is a1200oF S-Glass.  However, various high-temperature textiles can beused in the composite to provide protection from 500oF to 2,300oF.The layers are compressed into a uniform thickness (ranging from1/8-inch to 1/2-inch) and density (both standard and lightweight).The layers are then quilted into a finished composite.  TheExcelflex's standard configuration is 36" x 36" pads that are lock-stitched into one-inch squares.Market manager of Carborundum's Fibers Division, Jim Olchawski(Tel: 716/278-2008, Fax: 716/278-2440), calls Excelflex's extremelygood thermal conductivity its main advantage.  Because of thisexcellent thermal performance, Excelflex will provide the maximumamount of insulation within the smallest amount of weight andspace.  Stable at high temperatures, Excelflex has low thermaldiffusivity and excellent material strength characteristics. Also,Excelflex's flexiblity and ease of fabrication are importantconsiderations for many applications.Excelflex provides the best insulation (lowest thermalconductivity) of all the insulating products currently provided byCarborundum.  Olchawski recommends it as the material of choicewhenever high-temperature insulating materials are required andspace/weight savings are the primary consideration.  ExcelflexComposite Systems can reduce heat loss and reduce surfacetemperatures in a variety of materials, includingaerospace/defense, industrial, and commercial markets.Aerospace/defense applications for Excelflex include thermalinsulation/fire protection in aircraft engine struts, nacelles,cowlings, and avionics.  Industrial applications can be found innuclear power plants, petrochemical facilities, and otherindustrial areas (i.e. incinerators, heat-treatment furnaces,insulation for kilns and furnaces, and other metal/glass processingindustries).  Commercial applications include commercial ovens,night storage heaters, and many other appliance applications.Olchawski explains that Excelfrax is a "natural," the direct resultof two principal factors: The company's technical capabilities,developed over many years while working with Fiberfrax refractoryceramic fibers in the same markets and the partnerships createdbetween the company's full-service applications engineering teamand Carborundum customers in developing critical design solutionsfor any application.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Molecular Diffusionin a Single CrystalBoth industry and the scientific community are paying attention tozeolites as novel adsorbents and catalysts.  Significant attentionhas been paid to the measurement of diffusivity in zeolites, butthere has been little attention paid to applications based ondifferences in the rates of transport of molecules in zeolitemicropores.  However, microscopic methods that measure moleculardiffusion are beginning to surface.One of these methods has been investigated by Orhan Tula, D.B.Shah, and Shaozhuang Sun of Cleveland State University (Dept. ofChemical Engineering, Cleveland, OH 44115).  Their method involvesmodifying a single-crystal zeolite membrane.  The modificationconsists of incorporating a high-sensitivity Mass SelectiveDetector (MSD) into the membrane.  The MSD determines theconcentration of the diffusing species on the receiving side.  Itmeasures the small increase in concentration that occurs as a smallamount of substance diffuses through the crystal.Tula et al report that the modification yields a more accuratemeasurement.  Modifying the membrane with the MSD also enables theresearch to use a setup that measures directional diffusivity, aswell as concurrent and countercurrent diffusion.  To test theefficacy of its modification, the investigators measured theintracrystalline diffusivities of normal alkanes through silicates.The scientists results show a corresponding increase of thediffusivities of the hydrocarbons as the carbon number rises, dueto critical diameters being almost the same.  However, the lengthof the molecules affect diffusion.  Ethane with a length doublethat of methane exhibits a significant decrease in diffusivity overmethane.  Therefore, the team asserts that with carbon numbers lessthan six, the critical diameter is the major influence on thediffusion process.  With numbers larger than six, the hydrocarbonsexhibit a more relative diffusion decrease.Some difficulties need to be overcome before the full potential ofMSD modification can be realized. Problems with MSD calibration atlow concentration need to be solved.  The zeolite membranes need tobe made from larger crystals.  Researchers need a good embeddingmethod, one that can withstand high temperatures, in order tomeasure diffusivities at elevated levels.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Solid/Solid ReactionPrepares Redox VE.M. El Malki and a host of researchers from the University ofPierre and Marie Curie (Laboratoire de Reactivite de Surface,Paris, France) have prepared redox molecular sieves by solid-solidreactions, using a thermally pretreated vanadium (V)/beta-molecularsieve mixture.  Measurement techniques indicate that thermalpretreatment at intense temperatures (900oF) reduces only 6% of thevanadium in the mixture.Calcination causes the solid-solid reaction to disperse thevanadium ions inside the zeolite channels.  Tests indicate that, indehydrated samples, superhyperfine interactions occur between theunpaired electron of vanadyl cations and the aluminum nuclei. Inhydrated samples, though, evidence exists of intraporosity invanadium tetrahedral species, which are difficult to rehydrate. Theresearchers surmise this evidence from the persistence of a band260 nm at long hydration periods (about 8 days).X-ray diffraction reveals the beta-molecular sieve to be unalteredby the intraporosity vanadium species, even after pretreatment.  Itis cautioned that weakening of the zeolite framework could occursince BET tests indicate a porosity decrease in the presence of thevanadium species.  The researchers present their conclusions in theProceedings of the American Chemical Society, Division of PetroleumChemistry [40(1), 114-18, 1995].Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Adsorption IsothermsDetermined, ModeledMuch research has gone into aluminophosphate molecular sieves,particularly in the area of their water-adsorption characteristics.Citing a lack of literature on the single and/or multicomponentadsorption of permanent gases (i.e. nitrogen, carbon monoxide, andmethane) at room temperature by these adsorbates, a trio ofUniversity of Ottawa (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, 161 Louis-Pasteur, P.O. Box 450, Stn. 4, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 6N5, Canada)researchers headed by F.H. Tezel have conducted an investigation.Their investigation has resulted in a determination of adsorptionisotherms for a number of the permanent gases.  The determinationcomes from studying adsorption on three molecular sieves (AlPO4-11,AlPO4-17, and AlPO4-18) at temperatures between 23oC and 40oC andpressures up to 120 kPa.A decrease in the slope of the AlPO4-11's isotherms as thetemperature rises indicates the lower adsorptive capacity of thismolecular sieve at high temperatures.  This adsorbate exhibits itsgreatest capacity with methane and its lowest with nitrogen. Tezelet al attribute this to the "equal access" offered by this medium-pore molecular sieve to all gaseous adsorbates smaller than thoseof its pore aperture (3.9 x 5.1 in pore dimensions).  Methane,being the largest molecule (4.2 ), is easily trapped within the3.9 x 5.1  of the AlPO4-11.  Nitrogen, being the smallest molecule(3.0 x 4.1 ), easily leaves the adsorbed phase and is less easilyretained than the other gases.  The molecular sieve featuresintermediate capacity values for carbon monoxide (3.7 x 4.2 ).Tezel recognizes that AlPO4-11 adsorbs methane more readily than itdoes nitrogen and carbon monoxide at 40oC.  He attributes this toits larger molecular size and its energetic homogeneity and addsthat the nitrogen isotherm lies about the carbon monoxide isotherm.He explains this latter condition as a result of neighboringquadrupolar nitrogen molecules that repel each other to a lesserextent than do neighboring polar carbon monoxide molecules.  Thesmaller nitrogen molecules enter the molecular sieve pore openingsmore easily than the larger carbon monoxide molecules.For AlPO4-18, Tezel gives the following adsorptive capacitydecrease order at 40oC and 120 kPa: Carbon monoxide, methane, andnitrogen.  He explains that the researchers noticed a slight S-shape behavior for the carbon monoxide isotherm within the very lowpressure range.  The other isotherms of the other two gases exhibitlinear tendencies for the entire pressure range.Based on their data, Tezel and his colleagues have been able tomodel the adsorption isotherms, using Langmuir, Flory Huggins-Vacancy Solution Theory, and Freundlich equations.  Tezel reportsthat the team has  been able to predict binary adsorptionequilibria for the permanent gases and that stearic effectsregulate the adsorption mechanism in all three adsorbents.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Solid-Phase ExtractionIsolates and PurifiesSolid-phase extraction (SPE) is a powerful tool for chemicalisolation and purification.  From trace-level sample preparation toindustrial-scale chemical isolation, SPE plays an increasinglyimportant role in a broad range of applications, includingpharmaceutical, clinical, fine chemical, biomedical, food analyses,organic synthesis, environmental, and many others.  SPE utilizesthe same analyte/sorbent interactions that are exploited in thepowerful separation technique of high-performance liquidchromatography (HPLC).Varian Sample Preparation Products (24201 Frampton Ave., HarborCity, CA 90710; Tel: 310/539-6490 or 800/421-2825, Fax: 310/539-4270), formerly known as Analytichem International, pioneeredsolid-phase extraction technology with the introduction of the BondElut SPE extraction cartridge.  Normally, the cartridge is packedin straight-walled syringe-barrel tubes of ultraclean medical-gradepolypropylene and polyethylene or stainless steel frits.  Packedwithin each tube is a surface-modified bonded-silica sorbent.The sorbent selectively retains specific classes of chemicalcompounds within a given matrix.  As an example, the Bond Elutstrong cation exchanger (SCX) can be used to retain the cationicdrug, amphetamine, from urine.  The more specific the interactionbetween the sorbent and the analyte, the cleaner the final extract.Bonded silica sorbents are in many ways the ideal materials forchromatographic isolation.  This attribute comes primarily from thenumber of different functional groups that can be readily bonded tothe silica surface.  Bonded silicas are rigid supports that do notshrink or swell and form a clean, non-leachable substrate uponwhich the bonded functional groups are attached. They also arestable in a wide range of aqueous and organic solvent conditionsand possess very large surface areas due to their porosity.Solid-phase extraction works via three general extractionmechanisms:  Non-polar, polar, and ion exchange.  Each sorbentwithin a given extraction mechanism exhibits unique properties ofretention and selectivity that may be quite specific for a givenanalyte.  So even in an extraction calls for a non-polar extractionmechanism, it may be necessary to test several sorbents within agiven category to find the optimal balance between high recoveryand good clean-up.Both C18 and C8 give acceptably high recoveries for non-polaranalytes from an aqueous matrix.  The slightly increased polarityof C8 may allow many matrix contaminants to pass through thecartridge unretained.  Otherwise, it would be retained on the morenon-polar C18 sorbent.  The end result would be a cleaner finalextract with the C8 sorbent.Bond Elut cartridges come in a variety of sizes, ranging from 50 mgto 10 g of sorbent.  Smaller cartridges are useful when a samplesize is very small or when the ability to elute the analyte in avery small volume is needed for maximum concentration.  For sampleor rinse volumes greater than the volume of the standard Bond Elutcartridge, Varian recommends its Bond Elut LRC configuration as analternative.The flared shape of this cartridge allows users to pour up to 10 mlin it, without having to use additional adapters or reservoirs.The wide opening of the Bond Elut LRC also makes alignment andsample introduction easy for automated sample-processing robots.The cartridge's tubes have a sturdy, double-ridged lip thatprovides a consistent seal for reliable performance when used withthese robotic work stations.The Bondesil sorbents and sorbent-bed geometry of Bond Elut LRCcartridges are the same as the standard straight-barreled Bond Elutcartridges. This means that any method used on a standard cartridgemay be immediately transferred to a Bond Elut LRC with little or nomodification.Maximum retention capacity for polar and non-polar sorbents isapproximately 5% of the sorbent mass (i.e. 5 mg for a 100 mgsorbent bed).  However, this value must take into accountadditional compounds present in the sample matrix that are alsoretained by the sorbent.  Thus, for the compound users wish toextract, the effective capacity may be much less.  Varianrecommends testing the cartridge capacity for each specificapplication.Larger sorbent amounts provide greater capacity (the amount ofcompound that can be retained on the column).  Larger sorbentmasses also require more solvent to elute the compound from thecolumn.  Consequently, the analyte may be more dilute than if asmaller sorbent bed was used.Minimum elution volume for a cartridge is defined as two bedvolumes of elution solution.  Bed volume is 120 l per 100 mg ofsorbent.  In some cases, less than two bed volumes can be used.Such extractions are often very sensitive to flow rates and othervariables and are not recommended because irreproducible resultsmay be generated.Information on Varian's extensive sorbent cartridge line isavailable from Nigel Simpson, their Product Manager.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Reduction of FoodRadiostrontiumRadiostrontium contaminates foods and, once digested, accumulatesin the skeleton, where it is difficult to withdraw.  Scientists areseeking ways of preventing the consumption of radiostrontium infoodstuffs via the use of various adsorbents (mainly zeolites andmixed oxides of titanium, silica, or manganese). This isn't a largeproblem in the U.S., but is in much of the former USSR.Results obtained by A.M Puziy (Institute for Sorption and Problemsof Endoecology, Palladin prospect 32/34, 252142 Kiev, Ukraine), G.Bengtsson [MATFORSK (Norwegian Food Research Institute), Osloveien1, N-1430 s, Norway], and H.S. Hansen (Dept. of Animal Science,Agricultural University of Norway, 1432 s, Norway), indicate thatthe use of adsorptive materials may be regarded as promising forreducing foodstuff radioactivity.  The results come after testingof strontium binding by various sorbents in a number of differentwater solutions.The researchers have found that strontium adsorption from allstudied solutions depends upon pH, with a rise in pH resulting insteady adsorption increases for the titanium-silicate and thetitanium-manganese sorbents, in particular.  Adsorption on zeolitesremains almost constant.  The existence of either weakly orstrongly acidic groups explain these phenomena. All of theadsorbents exhibit high selectivities for tracer strontium in 0.1M of sodium chloride above a pH level of 6. However, in anartificial flood fluid (AFF), the zeolites (P and A4) exhibithigher selectivities than the mixed oxides above a pH level of 3.The research team have ascertained that the strontium binding inAFF fits well to a model of non-ideal competitive adsorption of 1:1stoichiometry.  The kinetics of AFF follow a biphasic manner witha rapid initial phase for all adsorbents. The second slow phasereveals a decrease for the zeolites and an increase for the mixedoxides.For reducing radiostrontium in liquid foodstuffs,  granular forms(titanium-silicate bound to activated carbon or titanium-manganese)for continuous flow through deep beds are recommended.  For batchapplications, they suggest powder forms of titanium-silicate orzeolites.

Better flow rates are valuable forenvironmental liquid/solid extraction procedures that requireextraction of large sample volumes.  Formulated for maximum flowthrough the membrane, the disks effectively adsorb organic analytesform aqueous samples and avoid many of the drawbacks associatedwith liquid/liquid extraction, such as emulsion formation, laborintensiveness, delicate expensive glassware, and excessive solventusage.Based on a combination of 3M's Teflon processing technology andVarian SPP's sorbents, the Empore Disk cartridge consists of amembrane that contains either embedded polymeric or silica-basedsorbent particles.  The particles are tightly bound in andindividually suspended in a web of inter-micro PTFE fibrils. Thisleaves the surface of each particle free for maximum interactionwith the sample during separation.  The result is a very highefficiency SPE device with superior purity and outstanding flowcharacteristics.Since the sorbent is held in place by the inert PTFE matrix, theEmpore disk is compatible with virtually all organic and inorganicsolvents.  The physical and chemical properties of the Emporedisks, with their silica-based Bondesil sorbents and a new expandedrange of HPLC-grade polymeric sorbents, present practicallyunlimited possibilities for the separation scientists.Empore disks are available in a number of bonded phases.  Disks areavailable in three diameters: 25, 47, and 90 mm.  By increasing thediameter of the disk used, the disk surface area available forsample passage increases dramatically, resulting in better solventflow rates through the disk.For more information on Empore Extraction disks, contact NigelSimpson, product manager, or customer service (Tel: 800/421-2825).Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Thin-Film ZeoliteReadied for MarketZeolite membranes can  separate nitrogen from natural gas depositsand remove hydrogen from hydrocarbons, such as benzene or methane.They have proven effective in removing noxious chemicals (i.e.carbon tetrachloride) from pollution sources. Research, especiallyon the academic level, is underway that could yield commercialbenefits.Researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder (Boulder, CO80309-0009; Tel: 303/492-6100, Fax: 303/492-5894) have developed athin-film zeolite membrane.  The new membrane can withstand hightemperatures and harsh (chemical) environments.The technology for the membrane involves growing ultrathin layersof zeolite crystals on the interior walls of small ceramic andstainless steel tubes. Formation of the membranes occurs withplacement of a zeolite-forming gel inside the small tubes.  Aftereach end is capped, the gel is heated to a temperature untilcrystals form around microscopic octagonal pores.The resultant zeolite crystals contain very small uniform-sizedpores about the size of a small molecule. This uniformity and smallpore size allows smaller gas and vapor molecules to pass throughthe zeolite membrane and rejects larger molecules.  The researchersare extending their technology through a project for designingzeolite membranes for use in environmental sensing devices thatwill detect minute quantities of pollutants.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996RO Separation withClay InvestigatedBuilding upon the knowledge that pure clay membranes reject ionicsolutes and desiring to broaden the scope of membrane separationtechnology beyond salt rejection, scientists from Japan and Canadahave investigated the solute separation characteristics ofmontmorillonite membranes in reverse osmosis.  Investigatorsinclude T. Matsuura (Dept. of Chemical Engineering), C. Detellier(Dept. of Chemistry) of the Industrial Membrane Research Institute(University of Ottawa, 161 Louis-Pasteur, P.O. Box 450, Ottawa, K1N6N5, Ontario, Canada), and M. Ishiguro of the National ResearchInstitute of Agricultural Engineering (2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba,Ibaraki 305, Japan).In the Journal of Membrane Science (107, 87-92, 1995), thescientists draw the following conclusions from their experimentaldata:  A montmorillonite layer works well as a reverse-osmosis membranein rejecting electrolyte solutions;  The montmorillonite membranes exhibit similar characteristics tocharged membranes;  The montmorillonite membranes exhibit lower separation of non-ionized organic solutes than polymeric membranes; and  The separation of amino acids with the montmorillonite membranedepends upon the net charge of the amino acid.The scientists base these conclusions on experiments with Smectitesthat come in two-dimensional arrays of silicon-oxygen tetrahedraand aluminum or magnesium oxygen-hydroxyl octahedral. The clay (inthe form of a paste) is coated on (until all of the paste istransferred into the cell) and sandwiched between two milliporefilters of 0.1 m pore diameter.  The filters are placed on aporous stainless steel surface.  The scientists advise placing afilter paper between the millipore filter and the porous stainlesssteel.  Doing so minimizes potential damage when applying highpressures of various non-ionized organic solutes.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROPOROUS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CALENDARFebruary 16-17, XIV IMS Conference: Membranes in Chemical andBiochemical Industries, New Delhi, India.

Chase, synthesized Si nanoclusterswith average diameters of only a few nanometers (nm) using thermalvaporization of Si in an argon (Ar) gas background.  The firstmonolayer of Si nanoclusters was deposited directly onto the basalplane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, and the layer wasexposed to oxygen (O2) for five minutes.  Although, additionalmonolayers were added until the film thickness reached about 250nm, no photoluminescence was observed.Post annealing the film in O2 produced a white photoluminescence,which peaked at about 600 nm.  The photoluminescence increased inintensity as a function of annealing time and temperature up to850(C without any accompanying shift in wavelength.  The decay timewas less than five nanoseconds.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed extensive oxidation ofthe film, and the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of the filmshowed a strong resemblance to the optical absorption curve of bulkSi, except for an increase in absorption at wavelengths longer than375 nm.  The scientists attribute the photoluminescence to therecombination of carriers in localized defect centers in thesilicon oxide layer.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Optronics ImprovesReflectance, DurabilityOptronic Labs, Inc.

(600Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ 07974; Tel: 201/582-3000).  NareshChand relates, in U.S. Patent 5,440,575, that the new films havelow levels of cracks, voids and particulate contamination and thatthey are stable in ambient atmospheres.The surfaces of nearly all semiconductor lasers must be protectedand/or modified.  Although dielectric films suitable for somedevices are widely used, e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO2) on silicon(Si), there is a need for a dielectric that is mechanically andchemically stable and free of pinholes, cracks, particulates andvoids.  It should also have good adhesion, be highly resistant tomoisture penetration and be adaptable for use as a semiconductorlaser facet coating regardless of emission wavelength.A number of materials, including yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ),have been proposed, but end up with shortcomings, including poorreproducibility with respect to refractive index and/or mechanicalstress and contamination with particulates.  In addition,conventional facet coatings are not normally stable in the ambientatmosphere, causing changes in laser properties and premature laserfailure.Because of the problems associated with conventional facetcoatings, nearly all such devices are packaged in hermetic, gas-filled enclosures.  These hermetic lasers are widely used inoptical fiber communications, optical interconnects, sensors, andprinting.  Hermetic enclosures add to the complexity ofmanufacturing processes, reduces yield, and increases the cost ofthe devices.  The AT&T researchers sought a highly reliable laserfacet coating stable in the ambient atmosphere.The AT&T scientists discovered that under the right processingconditions, high quality silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable foruse as laser facet coatings could be produced.  The key to theirwork was the use of a deposition by molecular beam techniqueinstead of conventional thermal evaporation processes.  The surfacelayer of the film is nearly always SiO2, but this layer normallyrepresents only about 10% of the entire film in most cases.  Ifparticular reflectivities are needed, the SiOx film can be combinedwith layers of other dielectric or semiconductor materialsdeposited using the same technique.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Poly-Optical DebutesScintillating ProductPoly-Optical Products, Inc.

Global Loop, Tucson, AZ 85706; Tel: 520/746-1234,Fax: 520/294-3300, email: opc_info@ix.netcom.com) in a new, gas-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure that may detectemphysema, asthma, pulmonary embolisms, and other lung diseasesthat have been difficult or impossible to diagnose withconventional proton MRI.  Employing this experimental "laser-polarized" gas MRI method, physicists at Princeton University andscientists with Duke University's Center for In Vivo Microscopyacquired the first high resolution images of a human lung, reportsOPC's Merrill Apter.Since they are filled with air and not water, a human lung isdifficult to image effectively using proton MRI because they lackthe necessary hydrogen atoms to produce a resolute picture.  Whilex-rays of the lungs can show some accumulation of fluid and scartissue, their exposures are too short to reveal porous lung tissue.Other diagnostic procedures for imaging the lungs, such asventilation scans with radioactive isotopes, expose the patient tosignificant levels of radiation and often fail to producesufficiently high-resolution images.  The noble gases used in thelaser-polarized gas MRI technique--usually helium (He) or xenon(Xe)--are inert and nonradioactive and therefore are harmlessinhalants, posing no health risk to the patient.Tuned to 795 nanometers (nm), the diode laser stimulates an atomictransition in the alkali metal rubidium (Rb) which is driven intoa vapor in a small oven heated to about 180C.  The Rb vaporbecomes polarized in the process and subsequently transfers some ofthe polarization to the nuclei of 3He or 129Xe during gas phasecollisions in a 50-100 cubic centimeter (cc) sealed cell.  Aftersufficient polarization is generated in the noble gas it can thenbe cooled to room temperature (condensing the rubidium vapor) andinhaled into the lungs for imaging.Physicist Hunter Middleton of Princeton University (223 JadwinHall, Princeton, NJ 08544; Tel: 609/258-2843, Fax: 609/258-1124,email: midleton@princeton.edu) describes how the research teamrelies on intense light from OPC's high power, diode lasers toproduce the required volumes of polarized gas.  "The highlypolarized state of the noble gas allows images taken with the newMRI technique to be generated in seconds, compared to the minutesoften required for conventional MRIs," says Middleton.  When theproject began they were using five sets of large titanium:sapphirelaser systems pumped by argon ion lasers to achieve the requiredlevels of polarization, but it was found that they were tooexpensive and inefficient.Turning to diode lasers, they were able to dramatically lower theiroperating costs. The compact 20-watt open heatsink diode laserinitially employed in the new MRI technique was priced at about$4,000 and used less than 80 watts of electrical input power.  Bycomparison, the argon ion and titanium:sapphire lasers togetherwere priced in the neighborhood of $500,000 and used about 250 kWof electricity to produce the same output power. "Thetitanium:sapphire setup was so big it required a separate room,"explains Middleton.  "The diode laser array, on the other hand, isso small and efficient that it allows us to move the laserpolarized gas MRI station easily from the laboratory to a hospitalenvironment equipped with only a standard 110 volt wall outlet."The 20-watt array was more than adequate for imaging the lungs ofa guinea pig, but couldn't produce enough polarized gas necessaryfor human tests.  For the first test of a human lung, a 120-wattarray produced nearly 1 liter of polarized gas in 4 hours.  "Thoughthe spectral distribution, or emission bandwidth, of the diodelaser array (about 2.5 nm) is much broader than that oftitanium:sapphire lasers and exceeds the absorption line of therubidium as well, it's nevertheless extremely efficient in thisapplication," says Middleton.  "We believe that imaging thefunction of the lungs and other organs and tissues filled with airspaces using laser polarized gas has vast potential and may evolveinto a nice complement to conventional proton MRI."Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996DOE's NonproliferationProgram Uses DeviceTunable infrared (IR) lasers under construction at Deacon Research,Inc.

(2-26-30 Nishi-Azabu,Minato-Ku, Tokyo 106, Japan; Tel: 3/34062111, Fax: 3/34062395).Hisashi Ohtusuka reports that the temperature in the region insidethe case housing the optical module is kept constant, preventingthe output power and the wavelength of the produced beam fromfluctuating.Laser diode pumped solid lasers include a solid laser medium towhich a rare earth metal, e.g., neodymium (Nd) is added.  Themedium is pumped by a semiconductor laser, or laser diode.  Inorder for a laser beam from such a device to have as short awavelength as possible, a crystal of a nonlinear optical materialis located in the resonator of the laser.  The nonlinear opticalmaterial alters the wavelength of the laser beam.The temperature of the optical module of such a device isordinarily kept at a constant level in order to keep the outputpower of the laser diode and the wavelength of the laser beam fromfluctuating.  This temperature is normally maintained by placingthe optical module on the surface of an electronic temperatureadjusting device.The temperature in the vicinity of the laser diode or nonlinearoptical crystal is detected and adjusted as needed.  The problem isthat when both the optical module and the cooling device are housedin the same case, the temperature adjustments are often notaccurate enough to keep the laser diode output and the laser beamwavelength from fluctuating.The optical module of the Fuji Photo Film laser includes a laserdiode, a solid laser crystal which is excited by the beam producedby the laser diode, and a resonator.  All three components areplaced in an inner case.  An outer case contains the temperatureadjustment device, temperature sensors, control circuitry and theinner case.  The new construction makes it easier to maintain anaccurate temperature in the optical module, which in turn increasesthe accuracy of the laser diode output and the laser beamwavelength.  U.S. Patent 5,446,750 details the Fuji Photo Filmwork.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996LiNbO3 ImprovesDisk Drives, PrintersA waveguide layer has been formed on the surface of a lithiumniobate (LiNbO3) electrooptical material by scientists at HitachiKoki Co., Ltd (1060 Takeda, Katsuta City 312, Ibaraki, Japan; Tel:292/738111, Fax: 292/741730).  Keiji Kataoka reports that the layeris incorporated in a light control device that includes a lightdiffraction device mounted on the surface of the electroopticalmaterial and electrodes on the front and back surfaces.  The newdevice, described in U.S. Patent 5,444,567, is intended for use inlaser printers and optical disk drives.Some conventional light control devices take advantage of anelectrooptical effect in which the refractive index of atransparent medium is altered by applying an electric field.  Inone type of these devices, light is directed through anelectrooptical material.  In the other type, light is directedthrough a waveguide layer formed on an electrooptical material.In devices of the first type, an electrooptical material is formedin the shape of a triangular prism, and electrodes completely coverthe opposite major surfaces.  When a voltage is applied to theelectrodes, an electric field is generated.  Ingoing light isapplied to the prism, and outgoing light is deflected by theelectric field.In devices of the second type, a waveguide layer on the uppersurface of the electrooptical material.  Electrodes are formed onan exposed surface of the waveguide layer, and when a voltage isapplied between the electrodes an electric field is generated alongthe exposed surface.  Light passing between the electrodes isdeflected.To produce a large deflection of the outgoing light in the firsttype light control devices, the electric field must be increased,and the beam diameter of the incoming light must also be increased.Also, in order to obtain a large electric field with a smallapplied voltage, the thickness of the electrooptical material mustbe reduced.  As a result, in order to produce a large deflection ofthe outgoing light, a transversely extended oval shaped light mustbe made to enter a relatively thin electrooptical material.  Theproblem is that it is difficult to attain this configuration.To cause a large deflection of the outgoing light in the secondtype of light control devices, the electric field intensity must beincreased and the width of the light must also be increased.  Inorder to increase the electric field intensity, the intervalbetween the electrodes is decreased.  The problem here is that whenthe width of the light is increased, the electrode interval shouldalso be increased.  As a result, it is very difficult to produce alarge deflection of light.The goal of the Hitachi scientists was to build a light controldevice in which a large deflection angle or a large change in thelight focusing position can be achieved with only a small appliedvoltage.  The waveguide laser was formed by titanium (Ti) diffusionon the surface of the LiNbO3.  Incoming light is led by a gratinginto the waveguide layer and becomes directed light.  Since the newlight deflection device is effective in controlling the light path,it can be applied to a wide range of devices.In a laser printer the size of dots recorded on the recordingmaterial must be rapidly changed so that half tone recording can beaccurately performed.  New light control devices can increase thenumber of gradations from black to white, improving half tonepictures.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Achieving StabilityOver Longer TimesOptical waveguides with improved stability over extended periods oftime have been constructed by scientists at NEC Corp. (5-7-1 Shiba,Minato Ku, Tokyo 100, Japan; Tel: 3/34541111).  Naoki Kitamura andHiroshi Nishimoto disclosed that one of the new NEC devicesincludes two optical waveguides formed in lithium niobate (LiNbO3)substrate.  A blocking layer is formed on the device to block thediffusion of lithium (Li) ions from the substrate, and a silicondioxide (SiO2) buffer layer is formed on the blocking layer.  Theelectrodes, from which operating voltages are supplied, cover eachcoupling part of the two waveguides via the blocking and bufferlayers.Conventional waveguide optical switches fabricated on a LiNbO3crystal substrate have low light absorption, low loss, and goodefficiency due to their high electrooptical effect.  In suchdevices, a buffer layer is formed on an LiNbO3 substrate, whichincludes two titanium (Ti)-diffused waveguides.  Metallicelectrodes are formed on a coupling portion of each waveguide viathe buffer layer.The buffer layer prevents light propagating along the waveguidesfrom being absorbed by the electrodes.  SiO2 is used for the bufferlayer because its refraction index of 1.45 is smaller than the 2.2refractive index of the LiNbO3 substrate and because SiO2 exhibitslow light absorption.  When the buffer layer's refractive index issmall, it is more feasible to reduce its thickness to prevent theabsorption of light than it would be for a material with a largerefractive index.When switching voltages are applied to the electrodes, an externalelectric field concentrates on the buffer layer because thedielectric constant of the buffer layer is smaller than that of thesubstrate.  The electric field in the substrate is relativelysmall.  The magnitude of the switching voltages needed forswitching and modulation becomes higher for larger thicknesses ofthe buffer layer.The small refractive index and extremely low absorption of light ofSiO2 makes it the best known material for the buffer layer.  Theproblem is that when a DC voltage is applied between electrodes, Liions, diffused from the substrate into the buffer layer duringfabrication, are pulled by the electric field and collected underthe electrodes.  As a result, an electric field counter to theexternal electric field is generated between the electrodes.The magnitude of the counter electric field increases as the totalnumber of ions increases because SiO2 has a high ion conductivitydespite its relatively high electric insulating property.  If theexternally applied voltages are kept constant, the resultantelectric field applied to the waveguides is reduced by thegeneration of the counter electric field, causing a deteriorationof the device characteristics.

(555 S. Woodward, Birmingham, MI 48009;Tel: 810/642-7000) has been awarded a $100,000 research contract bythe U.S. Air Force to evaluate the integration of interactiveholography in manufacturing.  James Fischbach, president and CEO,reports that the contract represents Phase 1 of a projected 15-phase $200 million project if Phase 1 is successful.  Phase 2 wouldinvolve $750,000, and Phase 3 would be worth $5 million.American Propylaea, which developed the world's first full colorcommercial hologram in 1993, scored a major breakthrough in 1994when it achieved a 42 inch x 45 inch, full motion, true colorholographic display system, the largest yet developed.  Fischbachpredicts that holography will be a $5 billion per year businesswithin 10 years and identifies the automotive, entertainment,medical, and retail markets as those with the greatest potential.Fischbach says that interactive holography could make it possiblefor automakers to cut design and development time by 50%, enablingthem to bring new car models to market in under 20 months, comparedwith the present 42 months in the U.S. and 36 months in Japan.Holography could also reduce the need for exploratory surgery andassist in the training of surgeons, enabling them to view 3-Dinformation in free space in front of a monitor screen to help themdetect and locate abnormalities and rehearse operations.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Coherent, Uniphase inLicense AgreementCoherent, Inc.

As diode lasers experience rapidgrowth in a variety of applications, components for these lasersare expected to show the greatest gains in sales.  Laser materialsand equipment such as chillers and power supplies should alsoexperience substantial growth through the end of this decade.The world market for laser materials and components is estimated byBCC to currently stand at $1,059.3 million.  The world market isprojected to grow at an average annual growth rate of 9.1% to$1,637 in 2000.  The U.S. dominates the world laser materials andcomponents market, accounting for some 40% of total sale, followedby Europe and the Pacific region.  Countries in the Pacific regionare expected to experience the highest average annual growth ratesin sales, 10.3%.  In the next few years, the Pacific region isexpected to replace Europe as the second largest market.Growth in sales of laser materials and components is highlydependent on the sales of the laser systems with which they areused.  Laser markets that are expanding rapidly include materialprocessing, medical therapy and telecommunications.  The researcharea, traditionally a major consumer of laser components, is in aperiod of flux.While some research areas are being slashed due to militarycutbacks, research into lasers is expected to continue at a steadypace.  Lasers have become key components of advanced weaponssystems, and military spending in this area should not decline asrapidly as in other areas.  Nevertheless, sales of laser materialsand components for research applications are expected to grow at arate significantly slower than those for other applications.  As aresult, component manufacturers will have to more aggressivelytarget industrial customers in the future.The report analyzes five major market segments: laser materials,optical components, equipment, instruments, and diode lasercomponents.  Laser materials include laser crystals, gases and dyesused in solid state lasers, as well as optical substrates andcoatings which form the basis of optical components.  Sales in eachof these areas should experience average annual growth rates ofabout 8% as demand for solid state lasers and their associatedoptical components continues to expand.  Particular strength shouldoccur in sales of tunable laser materials which have madeconsiderable inroads into the scientific market.Optical components include lenses, mirrors, prisms and beamsplitters, windows, filters, fiber optics, and modulators anddeflectors.  As key elements of laser systems, lenses, mirrors, andfibers are the largest markets in this segment.  Sales of thesecomponents should match sales of the lasers in which they are usedand should see healthy growth in the years ahead.  Fiber opticwaveguides, while only a small part of this market segment, shouldexperience an average annual growth rate of nearly 13% due to arapid rise in medical application sales.Equipment covers power supplies and cooling systems, which shouldboth see strong gains.  Sales of power supplies will be paced bydemand from carbon dioxide lasers used in material processing.This application should also generate significant demand forcooling systems.  Instruments include beam analyzers, detectors,vibration isolation systems, and positioning equipment.  Theseinstruments are generally used in research applications, and thismarket is not expected to grow rapidly. The average annual growthrate for this market segment is expected to be 5.8%.  The lonebright spot in this area is beam analyzers, which are expected tosee much greater use in the fast growing diode market.Diode laser components include diode laser drivers and diode laseroptics.  Sales in both of these areas should continue to be robustsince the use of diode lasers is expanding rapidly in mayapplications.

(K&S2101 BlairMill Rd., Willow Grove, PA 19090-1795; Tel: 215/784-6000, Fax:215/659-7588), a producer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment,has incorporated a holographic diffuser/condenser lens assemblyfrom Physical Optics Corp. (POC, 20600 Gramercy Place, Building100, Torrance, CA 90501; Tel: 310/320-3088, Fax: 310/320-8067) inthe machine vision system of its model 1488 turbo wire bonder.  Thewire bonder relies on ultrasonic technology to bond gold oraluminum wire to a silicon chip, or die, preparing it forinstallation into a printed circuit board.The new lens assembly helps the wire bonder's machine vision systemlocate reference points on the die during the semiconductormanufacturing process.  Prior to adopting this new opticalcomponent, K&S manually glass bead blasted and lacquered a diffusersurface to one side of an off-the-shelf condenser lens, a timeconsuming and unpredictable technique that, combined with theinherent problems of the light emitting diode (LED) light sources,often diminished the performance of the machine.The new optics assembly in the computerized K&S wire bonderintegrates two complex optical elements, a POC holographictrademarked Light-Shaping Diffuser (LSD) epoxy replicated to theplano side of a standard glass condenser lens.  Epoxy replicationis a precision process used in the fabrication of high performanceoptics, from optical flats to diffraction gratings.  LSDs aresurface relief holographic elements that shape light by preciselycontrolling the energy distribution along the horizontal andvertical axes, allowing engineers to match the light source withthe area requiring illumination.The LSDs--which can be mass produced using a variety of surfacerelief manufacturing processes, including injection molding--homogenize and shape the LED light before feeding it through thefocusing condenser lens, allowing the wire bonder's patternrecognition system to easily locate reference points on the diepad.  The diffuser/lens component works with fewer surfaces, isprealigned, and possesses the ability to perform tasks that areeither difficult, impossible or very expensive to do separately,says POC.The lens assembly takes advantage of the uniform light distributionand high diffusion rate of LSDs to overcome some of the problemscommon among LED light sources, including variations in brightness,structure, light distribution and alignment.  By doing this, itenables the wire bonder to attach the tiny wires--typically about0.001 inch in diameter--with more precision and accuracy than waspossible with the manually applied diffuser surface.POC manufactures holographic optical elements used in machinevision, LCD backlights, inspection lighting, and auto displays.The company works closely with product designers to pursue newindustrial, military, and commercial applications for itstechnologies.

(431 E. Spruce St., Tarpon Springs, FL 34689-4015;Tel: 813/938-0092).  Potentially superior to chromium:lithiumstrontium aluminum fluoride (Cr3+:LiSrAlF6), the new crystal isbeing considered for use in tunable laser systems which can operatein the 250-400 nanometer (nm) range, reports Arlete Cassanho.Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 is presently the only crystal that can challengetitanium:sapphire as a broadly tunable, near infrared (NIR) lasersource.  The Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 materials and their isomorphs have anadvantage for use in rugged, compact, solid state lasers becausethey can be efficiently pumped by diode lasers.  So far, though, itis not clear that the Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 is the best choice.  Negligiblepassive loss, coupled with its potentially superiorthermomechanical and thermooptical properties make Cr3+:LiSrGaF6worthy of consideration.Initially, Lightning Optical will work with previously grownsamples of Cr3+:LiSrGaF6 to characterize its benefits.  The crystalcan be grown with practically zero passive loss, and in a largeboule size when the company's proprietary synthesis process isused.  The same synthesis will be used for Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 to reduceits passive losses to the same level as that measured in theCr3+:LiSrGaF6 crystals.The project also calls for the development of other criticalcomponents, antireflection coatings, capable of withstanding therigorous temperature cycling required for the tunability andfrequency conversion, while maintaining a high damage threshold.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996NIST Finds ThatDisorder Is UsefulScientists using x-ray diffraction crystallography know that fewcrystals have ideal diffraction patterns. Most materials exhibitdiffuse scattering caused by a number of factors grouped under thename "disorder."  These disorders result in a variety of physicalproperties useful in optoelectronics, semiconductors, and hightemperature superconductors.A new paper from the Thermophysics Div. of the National Instituteof Standards and Technology (NIST) Chemical Science and TechnologyLaboratory, in collaboration with the Australian NationalUniversity, presents a broad overview of the many areas wherediffuse x-ray scattering has been important in understanding thestructure and function of crystalline materials.Topics covered include alloy systems, simple inorganic systems suchas mixed oxides or halides, low-dimensional conductors, inclusioncompounds, molecular crystals, macromolecular crystals, and quasi-crystals.

The method is thefirst to use solution phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sizedcrystals at low temperature.  The semiconductors made by the newmethod may be used in devices such as light emitting diode (LED)displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact disc playersand computer components.  The breakthrough offers intriguingpossibilities of developing integrated devices consisting ofsemiconductors and polymers, plastics or composites.Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combiningother materials with the semiconductors because of the very hightemperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currentlyproduced at temperatures of 500-1,200(C, but the method William E.Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, email: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu), associateprofessor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis, hasdiscovered allows growth at 200(C.  Buhro's technique, thesolution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth method, is similar to the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) gas phase growth method which has been used forsome 30 years.Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by thenonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which donot allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at lowtemperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium andindium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are thesites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds indiumphosphide, gallium arsenide and indium arsenide (type III-Vsemiconductors) nucleate and grow.Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solidmechanism, a three phase system where the chemistry occurs insolution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited intothe liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizesout as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is toturn down the heat on solid state synthesis.  This new methodexpands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Building a New FlatPanel Video ScreenA researcher at the Dept. of Energy (DOE) Brookhaven National Lab(Box 5000, Upton, NY 11973-5000) has invented a flat panel videoscreen that uses lasers as a light source.  Uses of the device mayinclude video advertising displays, television, computers,automotive dashboard and aircraft cockpit displays, as well asportable military maps and wall-sized displays for homeentertainment.  Since the Brookhaven device has advantages inbrightness, contrast, and viewing angle over the new generation ofliquid crystal cockpit displays, the U.S. Air Force is fundingdevelopment of the flat panel device for use in its new planes.In another project involving the new technology funded by the Dept.of Defense (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA),Brookhaven also is working on a 5 ft. plastic television screen formilitary use.The Clinton Administration has identified developing flat paneldisplays as vital to the economic future of the U.S.  Brookhavenengineer James Veligdan (Tel: 516/282-5400) invented the device anddeveloped the display screen prototype, which is 9 in. wide by 5in. high and approximately 1 in. thick.  The new flat panel screenhas several advantages over current technologies.Many video display systems now on the market use cathode ray tubes(CRTs).  Although reliable, they are very large, heavy, and noteasily transportable.  Other than CRTs, the major current videodisplay technology is limited to liquid crystal displays (LCDs),which are comparatively difficult and expensive to manufacture.The Brookhaven technology works by directing light from a miniaturelaser to a scanner, which guides the light beam into the propersector of laminated wave guides.  Composed of multiple sheets oflaminated borosilicate glass or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)plastic, the waveguides direct the light to the screen to displaythe video image."The system is totally eye safe, high-contrast, and offersexceptionally wide viewing angles.  Also, the screen can be used incold weather, whereas liquid crystals thicken and freeze astemperatures dip below freezing.  The technology can be adapted todisplay 3D images if the viewer wears polarized glasses.Maintenance is easy and inexpensive," says Veligdan.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Reimaging UnitsImprove FocusOpto Power Corp.

The team, headed by Keh-Yung Cheng (Tel:217/333-6642, Fax: 217/244-6375, email: kcheng@uxl.cso.uiuc.edu),have used molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and strain induced laterallayering ordering (SILO) techniques to build quantum wires,nanoscale atomic structures believed to dramatically increase theefficiency and reliability of light emitting devices such as laserdiodes.Many of the advances in computing, data storage andtelecommunications have come as a result of the evolution ofsemiconductor materials.  While silicon has been utilized tostretch the bounds of computer processing power and speed, othersemiconductors have been applied to create photonic devices.  Suchdevices can emit or detect light; for example, semiconductor laserdiodes can be used to read data from compact disks.Over the past 30 years, the techniques for creating thesesemiconductors have been refined.  Using a MBE method, scientistscan grow semiconductors in layers as thin as one atom.  Byselecting the types of semiconductor material, properties such asthe color of its light emissions can be engineered.An ultrathin layer, or quantum well, has done much to improve thereliability and efficiency of light emitting devices.  This quantumwell is the center of a semiconductor sandwich that is only a fewdozen atoms thick.  When structures approach this nanoscale,electrons begin to change their characteristics and exhibit quantumsize effects.  Such changes can affect and improve the overallperformance of optical devices, such as achieving more lightgeneration for a laser diode.The next step in quantum devices are structures that utilizequantum wires.  Similar to quantum wells, quantum wires have atomicscale thickness in two dimensions instead of one.  With thisadditional degree of quantum confinement, it is theorized that evenhigher levels of efficiency and reliability can be observed inpractical optical devices.The color of a standard laser diode's output light can vary withtime and temperature.  Quantum wire lasers, though, are thought tomaintain uniform characteristics over a broader range ofenvironmental variables.  Until now, very little success has beenachieved in preparing such quantum wire structures.In the Illinois work, the SILO process used MBE to growalternating, ultrathin layers, less than two atoms thick, insidesemiconductor structures.  The number of atoms in each layer isslightly different, either lesser or greater, than would normallybe required.  The resulting atomic imbalance creates a strain forceinside the growing crystal.  The strain force, in turn, causescertain atoms to group together along lines on the growing surface.When the SILO process is combined with quantum well fabricationtechniques in MBE quantum wire regions are formed almostautomatically.Cheng's group has demonstrated laser devices emitting in thevisible and infrared (IR) spectra range using quantum wires.  Thedevices, showed various new and unexpected optical characteristics,are the subject of further research at the university.  Eventualend uses may include improved supermarket checkout scanners andhome fiber optic communications.Back to Headline List CopyrightOPTICAL MATERIALS & ENGINEERING NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Miniature NIRSpectrometerOcean Optics, Inc.

Engineered to meet the needs of the broad-basedNIR spectroscopy marketplace, including applications intelecommunications, biomedicine, chemistry, microelectronics andenvironmental monitoring, the new PbS-256 complements OOI'sexisting family of small ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) fiberoptic spectrometers.The PbS-256 features a 256-element lead sulfide linear chargecoupled device (CCD) focal plane array with an on-boardmultiplexer.  User adjustable integration times of 1.0 microsecondto about 100 milliseconds provide essential dynamic range andsensitivity for measurements at low and high light levels.  Thedynamic range of the new NIR spectrometer is further enhanced,reports OOI's Rob Morris, by detector-based dark currentsubtractors that utilize global and individual pixel adjustmentsvia digital to analog converters (DACs).  This minimizes unwantedcurrent that flows in a detector's pixels when no photons arehitting the detector.The PbS-256, like Ocean Optics' other miniature spectrometers,employs special optics designed for use with single strand opticalfibers.  The light from the fiber is dispersed by a fixed gratingacross the detector.  Spectra are captured in milliseconds andbrought into a Microsoft Windows-based data acquisition andprocessing software program that allows the user to set and controla host of functions, including sensor integration time, auto darkcurrent correction, signal averaging and optical measurementtechnique.  The system's operating software provides users with theability to view full spectra in real time as voltage or as percenttransmission or absorbance, and to store them as ASCII files.At $15,000 per unit, the PbS-256 is believed to offer NIR spectralcoverage for a fraction of the cost of scanning devices such asfourier transform IR (FTIR) spectrometers.  The system has nomoving parts and is dramatically smaller, more durable and easierto transport for field work than bulky mechanical scanning systems.OOI also offers a line of optional fiber optic light sources,probes and sensors compatible with the PbS-256.Established in 1992, OOI manufactures low cost, miniature fiberoptic spectrometers, probes, light sources and accessories forindustrial process control, environmental monitoring, and medicaland research applications.  The company's line of UV, VIS and NIRspectrometers includes PC plug-in, benchtop and notebook platforms,available in 12 different diffraction gratings and 5 standard inputfibers for configurement to a wide range of application needs.

(1-4-1 Meguro, Meguro-Ku,Tokyo 153, Japan; Tel: 3 3494111, Fax: 3 34954428).  Fumio Matsuireports that the new medium includes a transparent substrate, ametal phthalocyanine-based optical recording film, a metalreflective film, and a protective layer.Optical recording media normally have advantages over competitivematerials in memory capacity with respect to write-in or read-outoperations. Operations do not involve contact of components.  Thereis a trend to standardize such media, e.g., optical disks, withrespect to optical and mechanical characteristics.The reflectance or reflectance ratio, one of the opticalcharacteristics of a recording film, must be 10-90% beforerecording and 27-90% after recording, and the uniformity ofreflectance must be less than 12%.  Conventional techniques forcontrolling this reflectance call for either mixing different kindsof materials or producing films with variable thicknesses.There are several problems with existing techniques.  First, whendifferent materials are mixed, some internal reactions may occur.In such cases, it is extremely difficult to control the resultingreflectance.  Second, it is difficult to manufacture films withuniform thicknesses.  This also makes control of reflectancedifficult.The Pioneer Electronic scientists built an optical recording mediumthat includes a transparent light transmission substrate ofpolycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or amorphouspolyolefin (APO) resin.  The substrate, formed by aphotopolymerization technique, has a thickness of 1.0-1.5millimeters (mm).  A recording film is formed on the substrate byheating a metal phthalocyanine and circulating it in toluene for12-24 hrs.  The aggregated portion, obtained by removing thetoluene, is then dissolved in tetrafluoropropanol.The solvent fractions containing the aggregated and nonaggregatedfractions were applied to the substrate using a spin coatingtechnique at a thickness of about 130 mm.  A gold, aluminum, silveror copper reflective film is then formed by vacuum evaporation,sputtering, or ion plating techniques.  An epoxy, acrylic,silicone, or urethane resin is then used to provide a protectivelayer on the reflective film.  The improved control of the medium'sreflectance stems from the ability to mix the aggregated andnonaggregated portions of the solvent in precise ratios.

(3-2-5 Kasumigaseki,Chiyoda-Ku, Tokyo, Japan; Tel: 3/5937111, Fax: 3/5924267) areintended for use in optical recording media, NIR absorptionfilters, and liquid crystal display devices.  Hisato Itoh reportsthat the advantages of the new absorbers include light, weather andthermal resistance, as well as high molar extinction coefficients.NIR absorbers play an important role in optoelectronic applicationssuch as information recording media, display media, sensors, andgoggles.  Conventional absorbers, based on cyanine, anthraquinoneor naphthoquinone dyes or dithiol complexes, suffer from severaldisadvantages.  Cyanine dyes do not have sufficient light andthermal resistance.  The absorption wavelength of phthalocyaninedyes is 600-700 nanometers (nm), extremely short.  Anthraquinoneand naphthoquinone dyes have low molar extinction coefficients.Dithiol complexes are not thermally stable, and they also have lowmolar extinction coefficients.The Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals formulation is based on phthalocyaninederivatives in which each of the 4 benzene rings contained in themolecule have 1-4 substituent groups.  The intermediates arereacted with a metal halide, acetate, or sulfate by heating in asolvent such as urea.  The absorber is coated onto a transparentsubstrate using a spin coating process.

Semiconductor lasers have advanced a long waysince their first demonstration in the early 1960s and have a largeimpact on many devices today.They act as sources for optical fiber systems and permit thereading of data from compact discs and barcode labels.  VCSELs havemany advantages over conventional semiconductor lasers.  The mostobvious is the possibility of very large arrays and a narrowcircular output beam, which can be efficiently coupled into thecore of a fiber.  As a result, the author believes that the timefor a book devoted to VCSELs has come.The first chapter of the volume describes the history and prospectsof VCSELs and the choice of material systems for emission indifferent wavelengths.  The second chapter concerns the opticalproperties of short vertical cavities, and the quantum mechanicalprocesses facilitating optical gain and spontaneous emissionprocesses are the focus of the third chapter.  Concepts aredeveloped from basic principles, and the effect of strain on theoptical processes in quantum wells is also covered.  Readers areintroduced to techniques for epitaxial crystal growth and thefabrication of VCSEL devices in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 exploresthe resistance problems that can arise due to the manyheterojunctions in dielectric reflector stacks.Chapters 6 and 7 are case studies which describe measurements madeon 2 VCSEL structures, one grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)and the other by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).In Chapter 8, experimental data from these case studies areanalyzed using models, and the final chapter describes otheraspects of VCSELs such as modulation response, arrays and noiseperformance.The book does a good job of covering the VCSEL field and should beof value to those experienced in the optics field, as well as tonovices and students.

The combined company would have salesin excess of $300 million per year, saysFiberite CEO Jim Ashton.    "This announcement should come as nosurprise," Hercules chairman Thomas Gossagesaid in a statement. "In light of decliningdefense spending, our strategy has been tocouple Composite Products with anothercomposites business to create a majorsupplier for growing commercial markets."Carbon to be Separate    The sale nonetheless marks the end ofan era of Hercules in aerospace, as thecompany sold its composite structuresbusiness to Alliant Techsystems last year.The various Hercules Composite Productsoperations have annual sales of about $100million, some 80 percent of which is believedto be in fiber.    "We view the graphite fiber businesseffectively as a separate business and willrun it that way," Ashton told PM. He notesthat a chronic overcapacity situation incarbon fiber has largely evaporated, withsome grades of material now in short supply.    Fiberite already holds license rightsto some Hercules prepreg, notably 3501-6, ahigh-volume epoxy with applications on U.S.Navy aircraft.    Fiberite, which last year absorbed theformer U.S. Polymeric business of BPChemicals, will be the second largest U.S.weaver-prepregger if the pending merger withCiba Composites boosts Hexcel to the $600-million annual sales level.

Theprocess was developed via a collaborationwith the U.S. Army Materials Directorate.    Dubbed SMARTweave, (SMART is an acronymfor sensors mounted as roving threads), theprocess is described as "a patented systemfor sensing the existence and state of cureof the resin in RTM manufacturing. The sensorgrid, which comprises two orthogonal sets ofconductive filaments separated by one or morepreform layers, is placed within thecomposite mold.    As resin fills the mold, the gapsbetween the filament planes are filled withconductive resin, which completes anelectrical circuit. Associatedinstrumentation detects the signal and caninfer resin location and, in some resins,cure state."    The SMARTweave process was initiallydeveloped in the late 1980s but work has beenrevived due to "the recent rise in popularityof RTM." Recent improvements have included anincreased number of sensors and betterinstrumentation.    The process is related to smartstructures technology, too, as CCM notes thatthe sensors embedded in the parts cancontinue to function during the service lifeof the parts.for the U.S. Army at CCM, Bruce Fink, 302-831-8645; fax 302-831-8525; fink@ccm.udel.comBack to Headline List CopyrightPERFORMANCE MATERIALS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996GOETZ MASTSChange in Racing Rules Spurs DemandFor Composite Masts for Sailing YachtsLast year's change in IMS standards governingthe use of carbon fiber on racing yachts hasspurred demand for the material, reportsGoetz Marine Technology of Bristol, R.I.

The former SP prepreg operations werebought by The American Materials &Technologies Corporation, which is headed byPaul Pendorf, formerly of Fiberite and XXsysTechnologies.    The SP sale, which had been pendingsince at least last summer (PM, July 17), waswrapped up in Boston on December 20.    The purchase price was not disclosed.    Pendorf is acting president and generalmanager of Culver effective January 1following the resignation of SP presidentJohn Shoemaker. Pendorf plans to recruit anew Culver chief as he returns his attentionto the acquisition entity AMT.    Plans are to take AMT public by mid-year while pursuing further advanced materialacquisition opportunities, Pendorf told PM.    Culver City hopes to capitalize on itsposition in high-temperature (primarily PMR-15) composites for jet engines with a newepoxy, CE-9013, said to combine advantages of250F-cure self-adhesive and 350F-curestructural materials, says Culver R&D chiefJerry Hartman.'Not Autoclave-Oriented'    The material boasts 30-day tackretention at ambient temperatures, saysHartman, and SP has achieved void contents aslow as 3 percent on woven fibers usingstraight vacuum bagging. Many jet engine andnacelle manufacturers use subcontractors forrelatively large parts, he says, and "a lotof them are not autoclave-oriented."    Culver's new phenolic, designated CPH-2400, draws on the company's experience inmaterials for aircraft interiors, saysPendorf, but the new company plans to tacklebus, subway, intercity train "and even cruiseship" markets.    The product's distinction is its fireperformance, as it has been tested for 20/20OSU peak/total heat release as compared tothe current Federal Aviation Administrationstandard of 65/65.

The overall $700-million acquisitionincludes the West Coast Composites carbonfiber autoclave shaft operation at Carlsbad,Calif. that was bought by Cobra in 1991.    "Together, the Cobra and Titleistbrands will strengthen American Brands'position as the world leader in the estimated$4 billion golf industry," said Standard &Poor's, which noted that American Brandsbankrolled the purchase with proceeds fromdivested tobacco and life insurancebusinesses.Competitor Callaway Supports the Deal    "As a very small owner of Cobra stock,Callaway Golf Company will vote in favor ofthe proposed merger," said a statement by therival clubmaker. "We see strong positivesdeveloping long term for Callaway Golf, andfor golf in general" behind the Cobra-Titleist marriage, Callaway said    Cobra-West Coast makes upwards of 8,000shafts a day at Carlsbad, primarily withcarbon fiber prepreg with a limited amount ofglass in the shaft tips, says West CoastComposites GM Rich Bayer. For 1996, "It'sgoing to be Newport getting the bulk of ourbusiness," Bayer says, although West Coastalso buys from Fiberite and Toray Industries.The company uses standard, medium and high-modulus fiber grades from a variety ofsuppliers.    "We're one of the few companies that'sautoclave-curing graphite shafts," Bayersays. The process yields stronger clubscontaining less material per unit, and allowsWest Coast to avoid the cell-wrapping thatnecessitates extra sanding and finishingsteps.Independent in Shafts    "We're very close to a net part out ofthe autoclave," Bayer says.    The West Coast GM also notes that CobraGolf is one of the few manufacturers to besuccessful in full sets of golf clubs,manufacturing and marketing both woods andirons. Cobra also makes all its own shafts,at West Coast: "We don't go to anybody else,"Bayer told PM.

Thiokol replaced Amoco's ERL-1908 epoxywith its own UF-3323 material for the Castor120, which is filament wound with premium T-1000G carbon fiber from Toray Industries. Thechange was made some two and a half yearsago.Tailored Properties, Room-Temperature Storage    UF-3323 is now the basis for a familyof prepregs available both as towpreg forfilament winding or as woven broadgoods, saysThiokol's Rolf Johns. Prepregs are made atBrigham City, Utah.    The company works with severalsuppliers of dry woven fabric, and hasprepregged aramid, carbon (both PAN- andpitch-based) and glass fiber from nearly allof the fiber suppliers, including vendors oflarge-tow carbon fiber material such as AkzoFortafil and Zoltek.    As for resin, "We will tailor theformulations to what people need processing-wise," Johns says. The original UF-3323required a 24-hour cure at 270F, he says byway of example; now Thiokol offers UF-3325with a four-hour cure. Another key sellingpoint is a product line that requires norefrigeration, with room-temperature shelflife "measured in years, not weeks" (PM,December 18).    Besides the UF-3323 towpreg for casefilament-winding, Thiokol now employs its ownwoven prepreg for the Castor 120 skirts. Italso supplies prepreg as the cosmetic outerlayer for ski poles.

The plant is planned for Taloja, northof Bombay, with a total investment of some3.5 billion Indian rupees, or $100 millionU.S. Initial capacity upon completion in 1998will be 30,000 metric tons, or more than 66million pounds of glass fiber per year.    The plant will be expandable to 90,000metric tons of material per year. TheMahindra partnership and the plant at Talojamark O-C's first direct participation in theIndian market.    "We have targeted India as a strategicgrowth segment and intend to be a long-termdirect participant in this important andgrowing economy," O-C chairman and CEO GlenHiner said in statement.    "It is important to partner with theright local firm in India, and the MahindraGroup is an excellent choice. We look forwardto working closely with them to develop ourbusiness," Hiner said.    Financial details were not disclosed.    About 25 percent of the production fromthe Taloja plant will be sold in India, thepartners say, "and the rest will be availablefor the global composites market." Most ofthe production from India will be sold inSoutheast Asia and the Middle East, with theautomotive industry singled out by MadhusudanDewan, managing director of Owens-Corning'soperations in India.Marketing in '95, a Tech Center in '96    O-C earlier last year establishedoffices in the south-central Indian city ofBangalore and secured land rights for theTaloja plant site near Bombay.    "Owens-Corning will establish anApplication Development Center in Bangalorein 1996," Dewan said, "to help companiesoperating in India develop new end-useproducts using building and glass compositematerials and technology."    The announcement last month was O-C'sthird during the quarter detailing plans toincrease capacity for glass fiber over thenext three years. In early October, thecompany unveiled plans to add 45,000 metrictons of capacity to existing facilities inBrazil and South Korea. Later that month,Owens-Corning reported plans to add 135,000metric tons of capacity to existingfacilities in Western Europe and NorthAmerica.    The three total well over 460 millionpounds of new production capability.Capacity Seen Stimulating Use    "We expect the use of compositematerials to continue to grow and we areactively developing plans to support thatgrowth with additional capacity. Theexpansion plans being developed now are overand above the increases we announced earlierthis year," said Carl Hedlund, Owens-Corningpresident for Asia Pacific. "We are committedto supporting the growth of the globalcomposites business."    The market for composites is expectedto grow by about 5 percent per year in NorthAmerica and Western Europe, and by more than10 percent per year in Asia and the Pacific,Hedlund said, predicting that O-C'scommitment will encourage new advancedmaterials applications.

But infrastructure markets have beenslow to develop and engineers are learningthat a systems approach involving materials,processes and application mechanisms, as wellas committed construction industry partners,is the only way that advanced materials willbe accepted.    "It's the total system that's going tobe qualified," says Fiberite's Ray Williams,who has been pursuing the infrastructuremarket for composites for eight years."That's the material, and the process used,and the apparatus. It's the total system."Composites Seen Process-Dependent    "Composite materials can strengthenstructural elements, such as columns orbeams, and may possess economic potential inretrofitting deficient structures," MohsenSultan of the Engineering Services Center ofthe California Department of Transportation,or Caltrans, says in a paper delivered at afederally sponsored seismic retrofitconference last month in San Diego (the paperwas co-authored by Gary Hawkins of TheAerospace Corporation). "Unfortunately, thephysical properties of composites areextremely process dependent and may changefrom batch to batch and from contractor tocontractor.    "As a result, composites cannot beprocured like steel, which has very wellknown and reproducible properties," Sultansaid. "Even though the [composites] industryis rich in data related to aerospace andmarine applications, the data we need,relevant to civil engineering applications,is very limited."    Caltrans, accordingly, has devised atesting scheme aimed at developing standardsfor composite building applications with aninitial focus on seismic retrofits. Theoverall framework includes a $180,000 federalgrant for column testing at the University ofCalifornia at Irvine, the first-everadministration of testing fees by SAMPE (theSociety for the Advancement of Material andProcess Engineering), and the activeparticipation of The Aerospace Corporation toevaluate materials, particularly with an eyeto their long-term durability.Five Organizations in Testing    The five organizations that have thusfar contracted with SAMPE for $25,000 worthof testing by The Aerospace Corporation are --> Mitsubishi/Obayashi, --> Tonen/Niccho Iwai, --> Newport Adhesives & Composites, --> Hexcel-Fyfe, and --> The American Materials & TechnologiesCorporation.    "The reproducibility and durability ofthese systems does exist," says SAMPEtechnical director Charlie Hamermesh. "Wejust want to confirm it."    The process is slow, but the stakes arehigh. "We don't want to have a mistake madeand ruin it for everybody," says TheAerospace Corporation's Gary Hawkins. Ahighly visible bridge disaster would be theworst possible thing if linked in thepublic's eye with composites, but even a lessobtrusive mistake that required a buildingjob to be repeated could cast a pall overcomposites in the eyes of the civilengineering community.Caltrans is Critical    Another concern is that standards bedeveloped that encompass the whole range ofcomposite seismic retrofit techniques. "We'drather see a performance spec than a processspec," says Hamermesh.    "The State wants to do this and push itthrough," Hawkins says of the Caltranseffort. "We just want to do it carefully."Hawkins notes too that if the compositesindustry can convince Caltrans of the worthof advanced materials, then other marketswill fall into place. Once Caltrans gives itsnod, he says, "not only do all the otherstates fall into line, but a lot of countriesfollow too. They really do lead the way."SAMPE, Charlie Hamermesh, 818-331-0616, ext602; fax 818-332-8929Aerospace Corporation, Dr. Gary Hawkins, 310-336-7379; fax 310-336-1474Fiberite, Ray Williams, 619-489-8589Back to Headline List CopyrightPERFORMANCE MATERIALS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996TURBINE MATERIALSCeramics and Composites in Charleston;DoE Program Conference Fee is Just $95The Advanced Turbine Systems MaterialsWorkshop will take place February 13-14 atthe Hawthorn Suites Hotel in Charleston, S.C.

KraMZ financial manager Alexander Bocharov said output in Octoberand November was down by half on the previous year, resulting in losses ofRb42-bil by the start of December. The downturn had been caused mainly byan imbalance between domestic and world prices for primary aluminum,Bocharov said.

London-based lawyers Herbert Smith, acting onbehalf of Codelco, confirmed Friday that a writ was served on LMEring-dealer Sogemin Metals Ltd on Dec 21, alleging conspiracy to defraudthe Chilean company. Both Sogemin Metals Ltd and US subsidiary SogeminMetals Inc--which acted as introducing broker--are named in the action,together with two Chilean companies who acted as Sogemin agents in Chile,and individuals dealing with former Codelco trader Juan Pablo Davila. Nospecific financial claim is made in the writ.Codelco's losses in the 1994 copper futures trading debacle are estimatedat $174-mil, and the claim is expected to cover ``a significant part ofCodelco's losses'', according to Tim Parkes, partner at Herbert Smith.   He said he expected further legal proceedings to be instigated byCodelco against other trading companies in both London and New York as theinvestigation into the losses continues, but could not give a timescale forthese actions. Sogemin, a subsidiary of Belgium's Union Miniere, now has 14days from the serving of the writ to decide whether it will defend theaction, and a further two-to-three weeks to lodge a defense.   Sources close to the company said the matter is now in the hands of itslawyers. Sogemin chairman Michel Moser could not be reached for comment.   Judge Jose Benquis, who is conducting the international investigationsinto Codelco's losses, said earlier in the week that the next order ofbusiness will be a summons to testify issued to Juan Marcelo Avendano,Davila's brother-in-law and a Sogemin employee. Benquis said Avendano isnot currently living in Chile, and that his whereabouts are still unknown.   Also under investigation, said Benquis, is whether Davila's sizableprivate accounts in Caribbean banks, valued at over $1-mil, are linked tothe Sogemin payments. Davila has thus far failed to satisfactorily explainthe origin of the funds, charged Benquis: ``In fact, the situation, in myopinion, has worsened.''   Meanwhile, Chilean Deputy Luis Valentin Ferrada, of the RenovationNacional party and a member of the Congressional investigating committee,said Codelco's case against Sogemin only confirms the commission's originalcontention that Davila could not have acted without the collusion ofbrokers and intermediaries. Ferrada is calling for a beefed-upinvestigation in the US, where Codelco suffered losses in gold and silverspeculation.   On Dec 26, when the presidentially appointed joint State DefenseCouncil-Codelco commission investigating Codelco's losses announced at apress conference in Santiago that a suit had been filed against Sogemin,Council president Luis Bates said that the commission must act``cautiously'' and ``with reserve'' in disclosing details in the case tocomply with confidentiality restrictions mandated by foreign courts. ``Itis not our intention to be close-mouthed. Reserve and caution are demandedby foreign legislation, namely US and British, that prevents us fromproviding more information and jeopardizing progress in the case,'' saidBates. While internal investigations abroad are ``very advanced, we mustproceed at a different pace at the level of coordinated internationalinquiries,'' he added.   Codelco CEO Juan Villarzu, who was also present at the conference,conceded that Codelco will have to abandon hope of recovering the lion'sshare of financial losses, as they were incurred by financial``mismanagement'' at the hands of one of its own employees. NeverthelessCodelco aims to recover some of the loss by exacting damage payments fromthird parties involved. ``Our goal is to learn the truth, punish thoseresponsible, and to recover costs for Codelco and the country,'' saidVillarzu.   The commission, headed by Bates, launched its investigation abroad inDecember 1994 to determine whether foreign operators were linked toCodelco's 1993 futures trading losses. Until now only Davila had beenformally charged.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   ZALDIVAR PREPARES FOR EXPANDED PRODUCTION(Santiago)While other mining companies scour the Chilean Andes hoping to find theirown Escondida, Compania Minera Zaldivar has gone into production with asomewhat more modest deposit located in the same neighborhood.   Owned in equal parts by Outokumpu and Placer Dome, Zaldivar producedits first copper cathode in June 1995 and estimates total 1995 productionat 23,000mt. The plan is to boost production to 85,000mt in 1996, and hitfull capacity of 125,000mt/year in 1997.   Zaldivar has been blessed with a deposit that allows it to get intoproduction with very little capital cost. Before moving on to the main zoneit will first extract the primarily oxide ore that lies almost exposed atthe surface of the Pinta Verde zone. Although this segment, with an averageof 0.75%, is lower-grade ore than the 0.86% main zone, it has a lowstripping ratio making for quick cheap extraction with little waste.   ``From a cash flow point of view, it is ideal to develop this type ofmine,'' said Tapani Jarvinen, Zaldivar's general manager.   A short leaching cycle for the oxides from the Pinta Verde section wasan added bonus that could not be ignored when Zaldivar engineers designedthe production schedule. The Pinta Verde oxide leach cycle is about 150days. For comparison, Quebrada Blanca, controlled by Cominco Ltd and TeckCorp, has a leach cycle of 210 days.   Zaldivar will be ready to begin working the high-grade main segment ofits deposit by the middle of 1996. While Zaldivar's reserves of 316-mil mtgrading 1.14% don't compare to Escondida's 1.8-bil mt or Collahuasi's3.1-bil mt, it is still a hefty deposit.   Jarvinen said Zaldivar uses standard heap leaching technology with theaddition of some novelties like water flushing in the tertiary crushingprocess. Even though the mine is located at a high enough altitude towarrant special precaution for humans, who lose 20-30% of their cognitiveability, and specially designed diesel engines, the bacteria, it seems,don't suffer from the effects of the altitude.   Zaldivar has the largest solvent extraction and electrowinning complexin the world built in one stage on an undeveloped site. It is also thefirst large-scale use of Outokumpu's Vertical Smooth Flow technology, firstused at a cobalt/nickel plant in Finland in 1991. The system has beentested on a pilot plant scale at Codelco's Chuquicamata since 1992, andwill produce 90% recovery from pregnant leach solution.   The first productive phase--called ``Stage 0''--consists of extractingthe oxides, which have some secondary sulfides mixed in, in order to feedthe SX-EW operation. While this is happening, stripping will begin in themain zone. When the oxides are depleted, extraction will start at the Stage1 pit while the Stage 2 pit is being stripped and so on. Seventeen yearslater, Zaldivar expects to be finishing up on Stage 5.   The acid leaching will use about 200,000mt of sulfuric acid annually,and slightly more at the beginning. Like most new mines that see theirproductive lives extending into the 21st century, Zaldivar uses aGeopositioning Satellite realtime dispatch system, allowing one centraloffice to monitor all equipment movements and optimize their use.   Zaldivar and Escondida have decided to make the best of their physicalproximity, turning the lack of elbow room into an advantage for both ofthem, particularly Zaldivar. The ``synergy factor,'' as Jarvinen calls it,consists of cooperative infrastructure development, property leasing, andsome old-fashioned gentlemen's agreements. The two jointly built a 170kmaccess road connecting both sites to the Pan American Highway junctionoutside Antofagasta. The double circuit 220 kilovolt transmission line thatruns from the Zaldivar SX-EW plant substation to the El Crucero substationwas also a joint venture and serves both mines.   Zaldivar has signed an agreement with Escondida, giving it rights toincur on Escondida property when digging some of its pits, to obtain therequired slope grade. Zaldivar's processing plant is even located onEscondida property, through a special leasing agreement.   Zaldivar pumps process water from Negrillar, 100km to the east. In thecase of a hypothetical future water shortage by either mine, Zaldivarconsiders that the good neighbor policy it has sustained thus far withEscondida, which has rights to a closer well, would lead the two companiesto draw up an agreement for water sharing.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   WARBURG SAYS COPPER HAS PEAKEDIllustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Newly released research from S.G Warburg estimatesthat copper's $1.325/lb price in the second half of 1995 is as high as itwill go for the next three years.

Thedollar will decline slightly against some currencies, the inflation ratewill move higher, and both short-and long-term interest rates will continuetrending lower.   This is the prognosis of many economists despite the currentless-than-rosy economic picture. Economic growth has slowed in recentmonths, with the index of leading US indicators--the barometer of economicgrowth about nine months ahead--slumping 0.5% in October, the steepest dropin six months. October's fall followed a 0.1% decline in September. Inother bad economic news, the unemployment rate rose to 5.6% in Novemberfrom 5.5% in October, new home sales fell 2.7% in October from September,and 10-month sales were running at 2% below 1994 levels.   But these declines tempered by a surge in spending for new construction,which the Commerce Dept said rose 2.7% in October, the second consecutivemonthly increase and the largest in more than three years.   According to Anirvan Banerji, economist with the International BusinessCycle department at Columbia University in New York, the leading indicatorspoint to a continuation of relatively slow growth through the first half of1996 for the current US economic expansion, which began in March 1994. Henoted that the slow growth stems from a backlog of inventories due to weakretail sales. Inventories are ``having a drag on production,'' he noted.   ``Once the inventory correction is over, there will be a slight pickupin the economy some time in the first half, but it will be not robust,''Banerji said. Beyond the second quarter, his crystal ball becomes blurred.He does not rule out a mild recession, but notes: ``For the second half of1996, the indicators are not yet giving us a clear signal.''   The Conference Board's chief economist Gail Fosler is more optimistic.She said that with long-term interest rates remaining low, economic growthwill be much stronger during the first half of 1996 than it was in thefirst half of 1995. ``By heightening financial market expectations andpushing long-term interest rates lower than economic fundamentals warrant,the Fed has unwittingly set the stage for the next phase of theexpansion,'' she said.   Fosler noted that the budget now under debate in Washington will morelikely help US economic growth than hurt it, because about one-third of the$90-bil in proposed spending cuts in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 shiftsprogram responsibility to the states and may not ``materially affect totalgovernment activity.'' The remaining two-thirds represent Medicaid andMedicare reform. The economic effect of these reductions will be verydifferent from defense cuts in the 1980s, she claims, since they representdecelerations in spending growth, not outright reductions.   ``This will still leave the growth in federal health care spending attwice the rate of growth in business spending or non government health carecosts,'' Fosler said. She added that the accompanying tax cuts will boostconsumer income as well and further stimulate the economy.   Charles Schultz, an economist at the Brookings Institution, alsobelieves the economic expansion will continue. ``I don't see any greatdangers of a recession in 1996, but I think it [growth] will be a bitsoft,'' he said.   Similar views were expressed by Cynthia Latta, senior financialeconomist with DRI-McGraw-Hill. ``GDP growth will depend on what happens inthe budget talks,'' she said. But she noted that GDP will increase by2-2.5% in 1996. Third-quarter GDP growth was unchanged from the Q2 level at3%. She does not anticipate a decline in the economy and noted: ``I thinkthe Federal Reserve has made anticipatory moves, to a greater degree thanit did in the past, and preempted a downward move in the economy.''Low interest rates   Economic growth in 1996 will get a further boost from low interestrates. The Fed recently lowered its Federal Funds Rate by 0.25% to 5.5%,its first reduction since July. Most observers believe the Fed might bewilling to make further cuts to nudge the economy along, once there is anagreement on the budget.   But interest rates must eventually rise with any boost in economicgrowth. While higher interest rates may be delayed by ``excessiveoptimism'' about this year's budget package, the longer this ``necessaryadjustment'' takes, the higher interest rates will ultimately rise, theConference Board's Fosler said.   The Brookings Institution's Schultz noted that the budget outcome willplay a key role in determining future economic growth and also the level ofinterest rates. ``If there is some compromise, I would expect interestrates to remain in the same general area where they are now. I don't seenany particular reason why they should move up or down significantly fromwhere they are,'' he said. Schultz added: ``The likelihood is that anychanges over the short term will be down rather than up.''   However, further economic growth will accelerate the increase in theinflation rate, according to Fosler. ``The Federal Reserve Board's recentsuccess in curbing inflation may prove to be its own undoing,'' she said.And although inflation is currently running at a rate of 2-3%, it is morelikely to rise than decline, even though prices of consumer goods are stillrising at a 2% annual rate at the producer level and discounting appears tohave ended at the retail level. Fosler noted that prices respond quickly tochanges in demand and, therefore, a reacceleration in consumer demand willraise prices.Inflation under control   According to Schultz, inflation ``has been behaving very well and is notgetting out of hand.'' He added: ``I don't see any pressure being built upin the economy.'' He noted that raw materials prices and wages remainsubdued. DRI's Latta agrees, saying: ``I would not expect inflation to comein at over 3% next year. We could get a spike up in food and energy prices,but I would not expect the CPI core rate to go above 3%.'' The November CPIremained unchanged at 0.1%.   Further evidence that the US will not face any serious economic shocksin 1996 are the states of affairs in Japan and Europe, where economicgrowth remains anemic at best. One economist described Japan as ``a basketcase,'' but Latta said: ``I think the Japanese economy will remain fairlyweak but will slowly come out of its slump, because the government isbeginning to handle the banking problem.''   Economic problems facing the major US trading partners will help keepthe dollar from skidding against the major foreign currencies. DavidAbramson of the Bank Credit Analyst believes the dollar will ``go higherbecause the European economy is weaker than the US economy,'' adding: ``Weare not going to be too worried about the dollar until we see signs thatthe US economy is strengthening.''   Based on the assumption that Japan keeps interest rates low and expandsbank reserves to keep its stock market strong, Abramson forecasts the yenat Yen 108 to the dollar for much of 1996. Latta pegged it at Yen 100-105.As for the Deutschmark, Abramson said, ``Europe needs to do more to turnits economy around, and the pressure on the German economy will keep itscurrency at about DM1.55 to the dollar.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   CHINA FACING 1-MIL MT ALUMINA DEFICIT IN 1996(Hong Kong)China is likely to have a 1-mil mt deficit in the domestic alumina marketin 1996 despite a projected 9% increase in output from 1995 levels, Chinesealumina and aluminum producers said.

And a 6% import duty cut in January may force alumina producers tolower prices to the domestic market and to long-term contractors, oraluminum smelters will boost alumina imports, they noted.   Major alumina producers offer at Yuan 3,230/mt ($389) to the domesticmarket and Yuan 2,999.88/mt ($361) to long-term contractors. But the risein alumina output in 1996 is not expected to keep pace with strong aluminumdemand. With an easing in the tight power supply situation, aluminum outputis projected to rise to 1.7-mil to 1.8-mil mt from an estimated 1.65-mil mtin 1995, aluminum producers said.   Many aluminum smelters, particularly those located in northwestern andsouthwestern provinces, hope to be able to operate at full capacity in 1996after power shortages in 1995 forced production cuts, the sources said.Their heightened output is likely to marginally cover the moderate growthof domestic consumption, they said.   The producers' plans for 1996 hinge on electricity supply. As a resultof rapid economic growth for the past decade and slow growth of electricitygenerating capacity, electricity supply is insufficient to meet demand inmany Chinese provinces.   Most of the aluminum smelters in China's northwestern Gansu provincehave failed to operate at full capacity in 1995, with insufficientelectricity in the area forcing these smelters to cut 10-30% of productionthroughout the year, a local official said. Total aluminum productioncapacity in Gansu is estimated at 300,000mt/year, the official said, andmay be achieved in 1996 as the electricity supply is likely to increase. InQinghai province, adjacent to Gansu, inadequate electricity supplieslimited Qinghai Aluminum Smelter's production to only 110,000mt in 1995compared with its capacity of 200,000mt/year, a company source said.Although Qinghai Smelter is hoping to boost its production in 1996, thenecessary increase in power availability is still uncertain, he said:``Local authorities have been unable to promise a supply rise.''   Meanwhile, in China's southwestern Guizhou province, an electricityshortage forced the 190,000mt/year Guizhou Aluminum Smelter to cut 1995output to 150,000mt, a smelter source said. ``We were able to produceenough alumina to support our full aluminum capacity production, but noelectricity,'' said the source. Guizhou Aluminum is planning to run at fullcapacity in 1996 despite uncertain electricity supply, the source added.   Alumina producers will try to keep up with the increased aluminumoutput. In 1996, China Great Wall Aluminum Corp, China's largest aluminaproducer, plans to run at full capacity of 800,000mt/year after failing toreach its target capacity in 1995 because of continual technical problems,a company source said.   Shanxi Aluminum Smelter, China's second-largest producer, also plans tooperate at its full capacity of 800,000mt/year in 1996, with hopes that thefirm will fully utilize its new facilities after completing a capacityexpansion earlier this year, a company source said. Shanxi Aluminum isexpected to produce about 700,000-720,000mt of alumina in 1995, the sourceadded.   Meanwhile, Shandong Aluminum Corp and Guizhou Aluminum Smelter will alsolift their alumina production to 540,000mt and 310,000mt, respectively,company sources said. But production at Guizhou will also depend on thepower supply in the province. 1995 production totaled around 470,000mt forShandong and 300,000mt for Guizhou, company sources said.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   PLENTY HAPPENED IN THE WORLD OF METALSHaving started production in October this year, Pingguo Aluminum will beable to produce only 40,000-45,000mt of alumina in 1995, but the firm ishoping to boost its alumina output to 100,000-150,000mt in 1996 to coverits aluminum production demand, a company source said.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   RHODIUM PRICES PLUNGE TO 22-YEAR LOWS(New York)Much to the dismay of dealers and producers alike, rhodium prices havecontinued to decline, plunging to a low of $256/oz early last week beforebouncing back slightly by week's end. Prices are currently at their lowestlevels since 1973.   The rebound came when a European buyer, believed to represent a Swissbanker, sought to take advantage of the low prices by placing several buyorders. Even though the total purchase was about 50kg, the price shot upinto the $270-$290 range. ``The buying seems to emanate from a Swissbank,'' one London dealer noted. ``The metal was readily available at $245to $250 yesterday [Dec 28], and this guy came in this morning and took outsome cheap metal and that pushed the price up.''   The market has been at a virtual standstill in recent weeks, and onetrader noted that last week's burst of activity was the first real buyingsince October, when Johnson Matthey was believed to have been a majorplayer. ``I won't be surprised if it [the price] goes to $200,'' one tradersaid.   One London dealer noted that ``there's plenty of metal around,'' adding:``Consumers are still working off their stocks, and there's no additionaldemand to soak up the metal that is available.'' He said the increasedsupplies have been coming from recyclers while mine supplies have beenholding steady.   The state of the market has confused most analysts, who believed thatconsumers would be attracted by the relatively low prices of the metal andtake the opportunity to build their inventories. But so far that has nothappened.   One analyst explained that the major auto manufacturers, who are thelargest end users of rhodium, already have their cupboards full.``Consumers are locked in with long-term contracts from the producers andthere is not enough additional demand to soak up the supplies,'' he said.   Another analyst noted that when rhodium prices hit $7,000/oz in 1990,auto manufacturers began making improvements in both their engine designsand catalyst technology with the aim of reducing rhodium consumption. ``Theswitch away from rhodium is a one-way street, and it has not turned aroundonce prices began to fall,'' he said.   In recent years, Ford Motor Co and the major Japanese auto manufacturershave made big strides in increasing engine efficiency to reduce the needfor heavy loadings in catalytic converters. For many car models,palladium-based catalysts can do the job of meeting antipollutionstandards, because of cleaner-burning engines.   Another blow to rhodium is that demand from the European auto market hasnot panned out as anticipated, and smaller quantities of the metal arebeing used there. On top of that, mine supplies are up and more is on theway.   According to Johnson Matthey's Interim Review of the PGM markets,Zimbabwe's Hartley PGM mine will produce 11,500oz/year of rhodium when themine gets up to speed by early 1997. For 1995, rhodium supplies rose to438,000oz from 426,000oz in 1994, outstripping demand, which rose to422,000oz in 1994 from 386,000 oz in 1993.   Producers are in the unenviable position of not being able to curtailsupplies, even though prices are falling. Rhodium is a byproduct of PGMrefining and producers depend on their chief products (platinum andpalladium) to make a profit. Rhodium is frosting on the cake, but in recentyears the layer of frosting has been getting thinner.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   US GROUP BUYS MAGMA SHARESAustralian mining giant Broken Hill Proprietary may have to lift its bidfor takeover target Magma Copper after an aggressive New York fundmanagement group grabbed an 8% stake in the US company, according to anAustralian newspaper report.

In addition, the deposit rate forSilarsa silicon remains 24.62% for future imports, until the completion ofanother review, or unless a court appeal causes it to change. Commerce Deptofficials completed the review prior to the US government shutdown.   Commerce decided to keep the rate unchanged, despite the fact that USproducers American Silicon Technologies, Elkem, Globe, and SKW argued thatthe duties should be increased punitively because Silarsa did not cooperatein this review or a previous one. Silarsa asked to be excused fromresponding to Commerce's questionnaire because it exported only 331mtduring the period of review, in October 1993, and it stopped manufacturingsilicon metal in January 1994 and has no near-term plans to resumeproduction.   The US companies urged Commerce to increase the rate to the average ofthe petition rates, 81.31%, or, at a minimum, to the lowest petition rateof 49.35%, because they said the current rate is not sufficiently adverseto induce Silarsa's cooperation.   Silarsa dismissed the US industry's claim, saying the 24.62% marginconstitutes an insurmountable barrier which precluded it from participatingin the US market and precipitated its decision to cease production. UStrading company Hunter Douglas also submitted comments, arguing that anincrease in the rate would have punished unrelated US importers who mustactually pay the antidumping duties even though they have no control overforeign exporters or their decisions about whether to cooperate in Commercereviews. Commerce agreed with Silarsa that ``there is no evidence toindicate that, if Silarsa resumes production, the current rate isinsufficient to ensure Silarsa's cooperation in a subsequent review.''   However, US importers are not in the clear retroactively yet; the USindustry still has several appeals pending before the US courts, and it hasthe option of appealing this review as well.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   BRAZILIAN MERGER WILL PRODUCE MINING GIANT(Sao Paulo)Brazil's Eluma, Caraiba Metais, Paranapanema, and Paraibuna mining groupswere merged Dec 22 into a new company, Companhia Brasiliera de Metais NaoFerrosas (CBMNF), after several months of negotiations. A group ofBrazilian pension funds, headed by Bank of Brazil pension fund Previ--whichalready controlled Eluma--will pay $300-mil for control of the othercompanies. The new company will be set up officially in one month after anaudit performed by the pension companies on Caraiba, Paranapanema, andParaibuna.   CBMNF's shareholders' equity is $900-mil, with yearly sales of $1.1-bil.The new company has plans to invest $600-mil and increase yearly income to$1.8-bil. CBMNF will be one of the world's largest tin companies, the onlyBrazilian producer of electrolytic copper, and the second-largestBrazilian producer of zinc. Daniel Birmann, president of the ArbiGroup--which sold its shareholding in Caraiba Metais--commented, ``a largemegacompany was an old idea of the Arbi Group, but we weren't able toachieve it.''   The funds will control 98% of the voting capital of Paraibuna, 71% ofParanapanema, and 66% of Caraiba. Previ's partners in the new company arePetros (Petrobras' pension fund), Aeros (the Brazilian airline companies'pension fund), and Sistel (Telebras' pension fund). $30-mil of the $300-milprice tag was paid on the signing of the protocol. Previ president JoseValdir Ribeiro dos Reis said that other groups are interested in buyinginto the newly-merged group, though no definite commitment has been made;potential Brazilian partners include CVRD pension fund Valia, CVRD itself,Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, and BNDES, the national development bank.   Foreign groups have also expressed an interest, Ribeiro dos Reis said,citing Australia's BHP plus another unnamed company. ``We have discoveredmany synergies among these mining companies in Brazil and we believe thatthe new holding will be competitive internationally,'' he added.   Analyst Roberto Vinhaes of Investidor Profissional noted that ``sincethe mining sector has not gone through significant technologicalimprovements, one of the ways out is to gain economies of scale.'' He addedthat, among other advantages for large companies in the mineral sector,``if the price of tin drops, the company could offset it, for example, by arise in the price of copper.''   Caraiba Metais produces 170,000mt/year of electrolytic copper for theinternal market and exports what it does not sell in Brazil. Paranapanemaowns one of the world's largest tin mines, the 18,000mt/year Pitinga minein the Amazon, and also controls the operations of the Bom Futuro reservesin Rondonia through its Ebesa subsidiary. Pitinga's 1995 output wasexpected to reach 11,000mt, up 2,000mt from 1994. Production at Bom Futurowas projected at 3,500mt for 1995, giving a total of 14,500mt for theParanapanema group.   Zinc producer Paraibuna is currently heavily in debt, and is looking toinvest in hydroelectric energy generation to reduce costs. The companycurrently produces 70,000mt/year of primary zinc. Eluma, which producescopper products and copper/zinc and copper/tin alloys, recently underwent arestructuring process using technology from Italy's Europa Metalli group.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   US COMMERCE DEPT AMENDS INTERLINK MAGNESIUM DUTY ORDER(Washington)The US Commerce Dept has amended its final antidumping duty order formagnesium from Russia to clarify that Interlink has a zero dumping marginwhen importing from either of the two Russian producers. The recentdecision answers a complaint stemming from the end of the investigationearlier this year.   Commerce published its final determination in the antidumping case onMar 30, and the final duty order was published May 12. Interlink alleged onMay 11 that a ministerial error had been made in that Commerce incorrectlyassigned a margin for its sales of magnesium supplied by Russian producerSolikamsk Magnesium Works. Commerce found the allegation constituted aministerial error, but because the US industry had already appealed thedecision to the US Court of International Trade, Commerce was unable tocorrect the error and publish the amended final determination.   Subsequently, the court granted Commerce leave to correct theministerial error, which it did in a Dec 20 Federal Register notice, whichwas prepared prior to the latest US government shutdown. The noticeclarifies that Interlink has a zero antidumping deposit rate for magnesiumfrom Avisma and from Solikamsk, but faces 100.25% from any other Russianproducer. Avisma and Solikamsk are the only Russian producers currently inoperation.   Six other trading companies also have zero duty rates: Gerald Metals,AIOC, Greenwich Metals, Hochschild Partners, Hunter Douglas, and MGMetals.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   PRICE ADJUSTMENTSPlatt's Metals Week has made the following adjustments to its NY dealer PGMprices: platinum declined to $399-407/oz; palladium fell to $128-132; andrhodium went down to $240-265.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   EAGLE MINING POURS FIRST GOLDAustralia's Eagle Mining said last week the first gold has been poured atits Nimary gold mine near Wiluna.

EPA decided in 1991 that it would not prohibitthe combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries, but the decision waschallenged in the US Court of Appeals, which remanded the issue back to EPAin June of 1992.   In a published notice prepared prior to the current partial USgovernment shutdown, EPA stated that it concludes it is unnecessary toinclude lead-acid battery combustion restrictions because additionalefforts to remove batteries from municipal waste combustors would havelittle impact on the amount of lead entering the waste combustors andlittle effect on controlled lead emissions.   EPA cited tests and studies showing that the facilities typically haveonly one battery per 300 megagrams (Mg) to 700 Mg of municipal solid waste,and that a significant percentage of batteries do not make it to municipalcombustors. EPA assumed a lead-acid battery recycling rate of 94.4%, sothat only about 5-mil out of 87.8-mil batteries generated were not recycledin 1992. It noted that 37 states have battery recycling laws based on theBattery Council International model rule, with mandatory take-back anddeposit requirements.   As many as 45-mil batteries may be stored in individual households, EPAmaintains, so ``battery storage by households, therefore, may represent asignificant reservoir of automotive-type lead-acid batteries that do notimmediately enter the municipal solid waste stream or the recyclingsystem.''In addition, a test program conducted at the Burnaby, BC, municipal wastecombuster found that ``lead-acid batteries do not appear to be a measurablesource of stack gas Pb emission,'' EPA said.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightPLATT'S METALS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   MONTHLY PRICESIllustration(s):Table: Major Metals (This table is not available electronically.

The processconsists of mixing a coating compound with the supercritical fluidand then spraying the mixture onto a heated surface where achemical reaction forms a stable coating.  Carbon dioxide ornitrous oxide are the supercritical fluids used.  The mixture issprayed through a nozzle onto a heated surface.  The pressure andtemperature of the surface depend on the coating.  The ratios ofthe metal precursors can be controlled somewhat precisely to formfilms such as mixtures of metal oxides.Back to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991New Low-Temperature CVD Process for TiN CoatingsInjection molding dies for plastics is one of the leadingapplications of a patented low-temperature CVD process developed byLiburdi Engineering of Canada.  The lubricity of the TiN coatingimproves plastic flow and reduces sticking during the injectionmolding process.The even coating of complex shapes, deep crevices, and runnerpassages in the dies is a major advantage of this new method. Inaddition, the low coating - temperature (500-650 Degree C)maintains tool hardness and minimizes distortion which can occurwith conventional CVD at 1000 degree C.  No postcoating heattreatment is needed.The low coating-temperature is achieved by using a subchloride oftitanium, TiCl3, to produce the TiN.  The TiCl3 is made in thereaction chamber by chlorination of Ti pellets in a reducingatmosphere.  The coatings can be made more adherent as well as morecorrosion- or wear-resistant by controlling the gas flow rates, thetotal pressure, and the chlorinator and coating temperatures.Other applications for these adherent and wear-resistant coatingsare carbide inserts, stainless steel turbine compressor blades, anddies used in metal forming operations.  An investigation toestablish correlations between coating parameters, composition,structure, and properties is now going on with the objective ofimproving the ability to tailor the coatings for specificapplications.  The company is interested in providing coatingservices to the plastic-molding and metal-forming industries andare also looking at joint development of new applications for theseTiN coatings.For additional information contact Liburdi Engineering Ltd., 400Highway 6 North, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L9J 1E7.

Co-founders Richard E. Hartand Jerome J. Schmitt claim that the jet vapor process brings manyadvantages to thin film deposition.  They include low cost, greatuniformity and high throughput.  Unlike CVD and PVD, jet vaporworks in a rough vacuum at low temperatures, and doesn't use toxicgases.  The largest part of the JVD system is a standard,fan-cooled mechanical pump.An R&D model is expected to cost about half as much as otherdeposition methods, according to Mr. Hart.  Right now, they areworking with a small group of companies and are acting as customfabricators.  It took four years to get the first JVD patent and anR&D unit should be ready this year.  Production units may beseveral years away.In addition to CVD and PVD, the jet system may compete with e-beamsystems used for evaporation.  Compared to e-beams, JVD can operateat much higher pressure, but in a low vacuum, and still producegood results.  Mr. Schmitt added that since JVD doesn't need highvacuums, it also doesn't require long pump down times.JVD works with a mix of known principles of compressible gasdynamics, fast flow systems, high temperature processes, plasmachemistry and film deposition.  A supersonic jet flow of inertcarrier gas is formed by a nozzle.  This flow is directed into alow vacuum chamber.  This chamber is continuously evacuated by ahigh-speed mechanical pump.  Depositing vapor molecules are seededinto the jet flow from a vapor source positioned within the nozzle.Finally, the jet transports the vapor species to the preparedsubstrate's surface, where a hard, dense, adherent coating isformed.  This process is distinct from plasma spray methods wheredroplets of molten metals or various ceramics are deposited.The founders say that JVD offers important advantages for thefabrication of integrated circuits and to the broad applications inoptics and aerospace.  Whether this process can obtain sufficientmarket share from the current entrenched deposition methods remainsto be seen.Back to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991More on Lasers for Surface ModificationSeveral issues ago we featured the use of lasers for surfacetreatment.  Although a small part of the overall picture at thepresent time, this technology is expected to increase in volume inthe near future.We were recently attracted to a discussion about laser chemicalvapor deposition. It is one way of depositing metals on substratesand is being used in microelectronics packaging.  In a reactionchamber containing gaseous precursors that are inert at roomtemperatures, a focused laser beam is introduced to selectivelyheat regions of the substrate.  Only in these heated regions willthe gaseous precursors react with each other.  The precursors arecarefully chosen so that the desired metal is the only solidreaction product.For packaging applications, some metals are of particular interest.They include aluminum, copper, gold, and tungsten.Tungsten is an attractive choice because it is compatible with manyother metals and dielectrics, does not corrode, and iscost-efficient.Even though laser CVD requires placing the workpiece in anexhausted environment, as it usually involves hazardous gases, itcan be a cost-effective solution for some applications.  IBM, forexample, recently disclosed that it is using laser CVD of metals inthe manufacturing of its System/390 computers.  IBM researchers atAlmeden, California, had previously developed laser CVD processesfor several metals including gold.Back to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991Ceramic Coatings Possible for High Temperature Auto PartsAutomobile manufacturers are becoming more interested in usingthermal-barrier coatings (TBCs) on engine components that aresubjected to high exhaust temperatures, as well as excessivelyabrasive conditions.  TBCs have been used for many years onaircraft gas-turbine engine components.  Plasma-arc thermalspraying is used to apply coatings of zirconium oxides containingvarious stabilizers such as calcia, magnesia, yttria, ytterbia, andceria.Diesel engine applications are very attractive to auto makers.Zirconia TBCs offer many advantages including: Retaining heat in the combustion zone to improve efficiency. Reducing component surface temperature for protection from thermal shock and oxidation. Controlling heat loss to temperature-sensitive components. Providing improved wear-resistance.Ceramic coatings can provide wear resistance, depending on the typeof mechanical loading involved.  Sliding wear, typically found invalve stems and piston rings, requires a coating having  a lowcoefficient of friction, such as aluminum, bronze or titaniumdioxide.  On the other hand, cam lobes and crankshafts need acoating with a combination of high compressive strength and bondstrength, such as tungsten-carbide and chromium-carbide coatings.The advent of higher exhaust-gas temperatures has led to researchof other types of ceramic coating methods.  A two-layer ceramiccoating for the inner passages of the ductile-iron exhaustmanifolds of diesel engines has been developed by researchers atHino Motors Ltd. and Hitachi Metals Ltd.  Coating is done bypassing a ceramic slurry containing a water glass binder throughthe manifold.  Good adhesion between the iron substrate and thecoating is ensured by a layer of magnetite (2Fe0-Si02), which isformed on the coating prior to coating.The two-layer coating applied to the manifold is designed towithstand cracking and peeling caused by the thermal shocks ofhigh-temperature exhaust gases. Testing of coated diesel-enginemanifolds confirms that oxidation is reduced and reliable operationis obtained without cracking or peeling at temperatures to about800 degree C.  But higher temperatures cause the coating to shrink.This limits use of the coating to the temperature range experiencedby conventional, uncoated iron manifolds.  Coatings capable ofhigher operating temperatures are needed if iron manifolds are tocompete successfully with stainless steel parts.Additional research and development efforts are needed if automakers are to realize the protection from high temperaturesafforded by ceramic coatings.Back to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991Researchers Grow Diamond on Nickel SubstrateThe epitaxial growth of diamond on a nickel substrate has beenaccomplished by Japanese researchers at STA's National Institutefor Research in Inorganic Materials (NIRIM) and Onada Cement Co.,Ltd.The researchers used a nickel single-crystal substrate, over whichthey circulated a 0.5 percent methane gas mixture at a temperatureof approximately 880 degree C.  This produced epitaxial growth ofdiamond crystal on the substrate crystal and is claimed to be thefirst hetero-epitaxial growth of diamond on a substrate materialother than cubic boron nitride.According to both organizations, the researchers have yet toproduce a single-crystal film of diamond, but NIRIM confirmed thatepitaxial growth is indeed possible on a cobalt single-crystalsubstrate.  In addition, reports indicate that a copper single-crystal substrate may be used because of its suitable crystallinestructure.For more information contact NIRIM, 1-1 Namiki Sakuramura,Niihari-gun, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken 305 Japan, and the OnadaCement Company, Ltd., 6276 Onoda, Onoda City, Yamaguchi 756 Japan.Back to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991Diamond Coating for Erosion ProtectionThe Science and Technology Center of Westinghouse Electric Corp.has developed a diamond coating process for the protection of zincsulphide and zinc selenide soft windows, used in infrared sensors,from erosion caused by rain, dust, or sand.It should be noted that previous attempts to deposit diamonddirectly onto optical surfaces have been unsuccessful due todiamond's chemical and mechanical incompatibility with thesubstrate material, and to the fuzzy image created by theunevenness of the grown film surface.  The Westinghouse methodeliminates these problems by first depositing a diamond film ontoanother material using microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapordeposition.  The diamond-coated material is embedded in achalcogenide glass bonding layer, and the glass is sandwichedbetween the zinc compound and diamond film.  The outer surface,which is the original substrate, is removed and exposes the diamondnucleation surface.  The bonding process is independent of themethod used to deposit the diamond film. An immediate applicationtargeted for this process is the protection of infrared optics.Quality optics in the visual range requires further work to reducea slight residual fuzziness caused by scattering, but visual imagedistortion has been almost eliminated.  The company has filed fora patent on its optical brazing technique.Westinghouse researchers have coated windows up to about 40 mm (1.5in.) in diameter.  Work on coating larger windows and curvedsurfaces is under way.  The program is funded by the U.S. NavalWeapons Center, China Lake, California, and Westinghouse.According to the company, future applications could includemultispectral windows that pass both visual and IR wavelengths, formissles and spacecraft, protection of photovoltaic cells in space,shatterproof plastic eyeglasses, and scratch-free watch crystalsand mirrors.For more information, contact Westinghouse Corp., Science andTechnology Center, 1310 Beulah Road, Pittsburg, PA 15235.Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel for Producing Process EquipmentThe Kemira Engineering Company of Finland has developed a techniquefor bonding ordinary carbon steel and special metals together toproduce a fully corrosion-resistant coated steel.  The majorapplication for this kind of steel is the production of pressurevessels and other types of process equipment.  The coating may bea layer of acid-resistant or stainless steel, zirconium, titanium,or tantalum.The technique is called Chemface cladding.  Cost reductions of 30to 50 percent are estimated over conventional designs usingexpensive metals.  The company claims that the properties impartedby this technique include absolute adhesion, vacuum integrity oflinings, and good mechanical strain resistance.Depending on the temperature, the bond strength is estimated to beten to twenty times that needed for operation under vacuum.Another application being considered for Chemface linings is thereplacement of vitreous enamel and other more conventional liningsto reduce maintenance costs.For additonal information contact Kemira Engineering, Oulu Office,POB 171, SF 90101 Oulu, Finland.Back to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991Toyota Develops Material with Controlled HardnessA material that can be stimulated by an external voltage toincrease its hardness without increasing its volume has beendeveloped by the Toyota Motor Company.  The new material iscomposed of cobalt polymethacrylate particles dispersed in a matrixof isoprene rubber.  When the external voltage is applied, thebinding forces between the entangled chains of particles increase,reducing the elasticity of the chains and hardening the material.There are no visible external changes and the volume of thematerial remains constant.The hardness of a 1 mm-thick film of this material can be adjustedfrom 0.1 to 1.0 MPa.  Since the changes do not involve theabsorption or release of water, the material could be used in theelctronic suppression of irregular vibrations in car engines andbodies.For additonal information contact Toyota Motor Corp., CentralResearch and Development Laboratories, 1 Toyota-CHO, Toyota City,AICHI 471, Japan.Back to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991Zinc Coating On SiteZinc coating can now be done on site without having to dismantlestructures, according to Galvatech Ltd. of the United Kingdom.Described by the company as a "unique" anticorrosion product, Zingazinc coating can be applied by brush or spray.  It is a liquidcomponent which when dry contains at least 95 percent electrolyticzinc that bonds to steel or iron, even if mildly rusted, to providemaximum corrosion protection.Zinga actually provides cathodic protection.  The zinc coatingrusts instead of the steel or iron base.  If the zinc coating isscratched, the rust cannot creep under the coating and causebubbling.  Worn hot-dip galvanizing can be recoated.  It is notnecessary to dismantle structures like barriers, fencing or pylons.Existing coatings of Zinga can be renewed and the new surface willresemble its original condition.  There will be no separationbetween the layers.  The company says that structures do not haveto be grit-blasted again after coating.  Mildly rusted structurescan be recoated without grit-blasting.For more information contact Galvatech Ltd., 193 John St., LondonEC1V 4QA, UK.Back to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991INDUSTRY NEWS - Spire Corporation Announces First Quarter Sales andEarningsOn May 14th, Roger G.

It supports a three yearprogram to explore uses of SPI-TEXTTM surface texturing technologyfor stray light suppression in advanced Army sensor systems.Optical sensors are of vital importance to the next generation ofArmy interceptors, designed to guard against ballistic missiles.Since their mission requires extreme sensitivity anddiscrimination, these sensor systems must have exceedingly darkinterior surfaces, or optical baffles, to achieve adequate straylight rejection and pointing accuracy.  Baffle materials mustmaintain their optical performance in the face of the shock loadsof interceptor launch and maneuver.  In addition, baffle materialscannot introduce contamination which would compromise the sensorsystem's signal-to-noise performance.Today's commercially available baffle materials consist of eitherblack paints or acid-bath anodized metals.  The best bafflematerials have highly textured surfaces to create low reflectivity.But these surfaces are fragile and easily damaged by incidentalcontact during handling.  They also shed particles under flightvibration.  A critical examination of failure mechanisms in currentmaterials suggested an innovative approach to producing superiorbaffle materials.  Essentially, this approach is to texture themetal surface directly, creating millions of light-trapping poresand cones per square centimeter.This leaves a sturdy metal surface without minute, fragileinterfaces subject to mechanical failure.In an earlier research program with the Army Materials TechnologyLab, Spire developed SPI-TEXT ion beam texturing technology toproduce extremely dark surfaces which are immune to damage fromordinary handling.  This program, sponsored by the U.S. ArmyStrategic Defense Command and the U.S. Strategic Defense InitiativeOrganization, produced textured aluminum surfaces as dark as thebest commercial baffle materials without compromising mechanicalhardness.  In simulated launch vibration tests, this materialproduced no detectable contamination on adjacent catcher plates.Accoring to Dr. Edward A. Johnson, Spire program manager, "SPI-TEXToffers a technological breakthrough to meet the stray lightsuppression needs of advanced sensor systems."Roger Little, President of Spire, said, "Spire is extremely proudof the progress made to date in this important technologydevelopment effort and of our contribution to the Army strategicdefense program.  We believe that our approach to hardened bafflematerials technology development has provided the Army withsubstantially improved materials quickly and cost effectively.

Apelian, A. Lawley, and P. Mathur.  DrexelUniversity Department of Materials Engineering, Philadelphia, PA.This report summarizes the objectives, approach and salient resultsof a program on spray casting.  Spray casting via the Osprey<191>process is emerging as a promising technology to producenear-net-shaped components of advanced materials.  The processinvolves the sequential stages of gas atomization and dropletconsolidation on a substrate to produce a disk, billet, tube,and/or strip.  The major advantage of spray casting is the abilityto produce uniform, fine grained materials at deposition rates inthe range 0.25-2.5 kg/s in a single operation from the melt.Composite materials can be manufactured by injecting second phaseparticles into the spray of droplets, or by in-situ reactionsbetween the droplets and the gas during flight.  The objectiveswere to develop a scientific understanding of the physical andthermal phenomena that are active during spray casting and whichgovern the shape and microstructural integrity of the preforms andto evaluate the Osprey process for processing bulk high-strengthlow-alloy steels.Available from NTIS: AD-A217 202/1/ABSBack to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991Method of Preparing a Thin Diamond FilmPrepared by R.A.

By heating the interface of the clad material and substratealloy to the eutectic temperature of the binary alloy, a superiormetallurgical bond is produced with minimal melting and heating.With the process, only a very narrow region of the clad-substrateinterface is actually fused and the clad surface retains a smoothtexture which does not require subsequent machining.  The coveragerates which can be obtained with the process are one to two ordersof magnitude higher than reported in the literature for laser-assisted fusion cladding processes in which the entire clad layeris fused.Available from NTIS: PB90-1770 15/ABSBack to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991Chemical Cleaning of Aluminum Alloy Surfaces for Use as VacuumMaterials in Synchrotron Light SourcesPrepared by N. Kaufherr, A. Krauss, D.M. Gruen, and R. Nielsen,Argonne National Laboratory, ILPhoton and electron desorption from the vacuum chamber walls ofelectron storage rings such as the proposed Advanced Photon Source(APS), are sometimes responsible for the production of large gasloads during operation even in systems with very good staticvacuum.  The gas released by beam-induced desorption results inscattering of the beam electrons, and a consequent reduction in thebeam lifetime.  In extreme cases, the beam-induced outgassing maycause so much scattering that it is not possible to obtain thedesign goals with regard to obtainable beam current.  Consequently,it is important that the surfaces which are exposed to the electronbeam and photon fluxes contain as little trapped gas as possible,and that the gas burden during operation be kept as low aspossible.  The current study investigates the effectiveness of achemical cleaning tratment developed at CERN for the LEP storagering, as applied to the 6063 alloy to be used in APS.Additionally, depth profiling of the chemically cleaned samples andsamples which were vapor-degreased only, provides new insight onthe cleaning process as it applies to the alloy proposed for use inAPS.  14 refs., 8 figures.Back to Headline List CopyrightSURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1991SPECIAL PATENT ABSTRACTSPatent Number: 5,001,002Issue Date: 3/19/91Inventor(s): Gribbin, John D.; Bothe, Lothar; Dinter, PeterOrigin: DEXAssignee: Hoechst AktiengesellschaftTitle: Sheet-like structure consisting of a substrate and a coatingAbstract: A sheet-like structure consists of an adhesion-promotingcoating on at least one surface of the substrate.

Of particular interestis research being done in diamond sensing applications atVanderbilt University (Nashville, TN 37235) by J.L. Davidson (Tel:615/322-3479, Fax: 615/322-7996) and W.P. Kang.Sensors used to be simple mechanical springs or thermometers, butelectronic control and processing demand more sensitive andinterfaceable devices.  The area of optic sensors has becomesophisticated, led by demands for missile guidance and clearer TVimages.  The area of mechanical and chemical sensors has laggedbehind because of the lack of an appropriate semiconductor materialto meet the requirements.The entrance of diamond as a deposited layered film is changing thepicture.  Diamond's attractive properties such as very fast chargecarriers, high electric breakdown, and heat conductivity result inthe best estimated performance for speed and power of any material.Recently the discovery and development of what might be calledsophisticated secondary effects in diamond are opening interestingsensor applications.  For example, diamond containing boron becomesa semiconductor like silicon and will change electrical resistancewith strain, called piezoresistance.This means it can be used as a strain gauge on rugged electronicmicrosensors for pressure and acceleration sensing.  CVDpolycrystalline diamond films have been applied in radiationdetectors, photodetectors and thermistors.  They have theproperties of wide bandgap, low thermal coefficient of expansion,and high thermal conductivity.The paper presented at the MRS Meeting by the Vanderbiltresearchers discusses some critical issues about diamond formicroelectromechanical sensing applications such as the stresslimits and high temperature responses of a diamond pressure sensor.The authors describe an all diamond pressure microsensor thatmeasures pressures when the temperature exceeds 600(F.  This meansthat miniature electronic sensors can be used in critical placesnot previously possible, such as the end of oil well drill bits andin power plants and engines near the combustion zones.The researchers have also observed that layered diamond films canbehave as chemical sensors measuring oxygen, hydrogen, and manyother chemicals.  For example, a diamond-based chemical gas sensorusing layers of metal and diamond which acts directly as anelectronic device has been made and its behavior as a gas sensorhas been studied.  The adsorption of gases such as those found inautomobile exhausts by the diamond sensor causes changes in itselectrical current behavior similar to altering the sensitiveproperties of a transistor. Thus, an electronic change arises fromthe presence of a chemical.This kind of input, coupled to amplifying and computingelectronics, provides sensitive, fast and accurate chemicalmeasurements which can be very useful in emission control.  Becausethe sensor is diamond, it can perform these functions inenvironments and at temperatures that would not support monitoring.Additional information on this research can be obtained bycontacting the authors at the address and number above.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Diamond for ElectronField EmittersAnother application for diamond technology highlighted at the MRSFall Meeting was presented by Wei Zhu (AT&T Bell Labs, Tel:908/582-7659, Fax: 908/582-2783) and involved the electron fieldemission properties of diamond.  Field emitters may be a potentialreplacement for hot cathode tubes, because emitters are smaller anduse less power.  Diamond is a preferred field emission material dueto its durability, long lifetime and the low wattage it needs toperform electronic tasks.Field emitters are useful for a number of applications includingmicrowave power amplifiers, flat panel displays, ion guns andelectron sources for microscopes.  Typical field emitters usemetals or semiconductors like silicon with sharp tip geometries.But the control voltage required for emission from these materialsis relatively high (about 100 V) because of their work functions.The high voltage operation increases the probability of damaginginstabilites due to ion bombardment and surface diffusion of theemitting tips, so high power densities have to be supplied from anexternal source to produce the required emission current.  Inaddition, the fabrication of uniform sharp tips over a large areaproves to be a difficult and expensive process.Diamond has recently emerged as a desirable field emission materialbecause of its negative electron affinity and good mechanical andchemical properties.  To induce stable electron emission fromdiamond, however, either the bulk or the surface of diamond must bemade conductive.  And to take advantage of diamond's negativeelectron affinity for low voltage emission, diamond must be dopedas a n-type semiconductor.  Unfortunately, effective and reliablen-type dopants for diamond are not available at the present time.The AT&T researchers have investigated the emission properties ofa variety of undoped and p-type doped diamond samples, includingCVD deposited diamond and commercial diamond produced by thetraditional high pressure, high temperature method.  They found astrong correlation between the electrical field required foremission and the density of defects introduced in diamond.Low emission fields have been consistently demonstrated forappropriately processed diamond emitters.  The present status andfuture prospects of field emitters for various potentialapplications with respect to the availability of suitable materialswas also discussed in the presentation.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Diamond Like Materialsin Flat Panel DisplaysA specific presentation on diamond and diamond-like materials forflat panel displays was presented at the MRS meeting by KeithJamison and others  of SI Diamond Technology (Houston, TX; Tel:713/529-9040, Fax: 713/529-1147).  The next generation of flatpanel displays for computers, personal digital assistants, andother portable displays may rely on field emitted electronsstriking phosphor as the light source.This design is essentially a flat CRT where each pixel has its ownelectron gun.  Recent experiments have shown that diamond anddiamond-like materials may make robust field emission electronsources for this application.  Diamond has a high thermalconductivity, relative insensitivity to contamination and, whengrown under certain conditions, can emit electrons at relativelylow electric fields.SI Diamond Technology has constructed a prototype 50 x 50 pixeldisplay using diamond like carbon as the electron source as a proofof concept for diamond field emission displays.  The company iscurrently building a 1/4 VGA display that can be used in commercialapplications.The electron emission properties of SIDT's diamond like carboncathode was presented and compared to other diamond and diamond-like carbon emitters.  The emission properties were determinedusing a number of novel analytical techniques that simulate a fieldemission flat panel display and measure the emission uniformity ofthe material and emission site density over a given area.  Thecathode requirements for SIDT's flat panel display was alsopresented along with current performance of the diamond like carboncathode presently used by the company.

(Fremont, CA; Tel: 510/572-6692, Fax: 510/572-2935) announced two next generation CVD systems that answerproduction level dielectric film requirements on leading edgedevices with 0.35-micron and below design rules.The Deep SubMicron (DSM) 9900 deposits superior quality insulatingfilms between metal layers for intermetal dielectric (IMD)applications, while the DSM 9800 performs premetal dielectric (PMD)applications by depositing dielectric films prior to firstmetallization.  In addition, the 9800 does a number of otherapplications including Si02 spacers and Ta205 storage capacitorsfor 256 megabit dynamic random access memories (DRAMs).Together, these systems provide comprehensive dielectric filmsolution for chipmakers adopting 0.35-micron and below technology.Both systems are enhancements to Lam's prior generation systemstradenamed Integrity PMD and Epic CVD tools introduced for advanceddevelopment efforts in 1990 and 1993.Lam's chairman and CEO Roger D. Emerick noted that the 9000 seriesreflects Lam's intensified focus on the CVD market.  "We firstentered the market in the early 1990s with leapfrog technology.Once the market demand caught up with our technical innovations, weneeded to prepare these tools for production proliferation," statedEmerick.He added that the systems were designed with technologyextendability in mind--both the DSM 9900 and the DSM 9800 havedeposited films on devices with 0.18-micron feature sizes, and theDSM 9800 has successfully deposited high quality films on 300 mmwafers.To meet production requirements, the new 9000 series CVD toolsincorporate features and benefits developed over the last year incooperation with several leading chipmakers and SEMATECH.  Specificchanges include reduced footprint, increased throughput, lower costof ownership, and the development of process solutions for specificfilm types.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Smoother Films forMachine Tool CoatingsResearchers at Argonne National Lab (Argonne, IL 60439; Tel:800/627-2596) have developed a new process for growing thin diamondfilms from C60 molecules, known as buckyballs or fullerenes.  Theprocess, which uses fullerenes as precursors for diamond filmgrowth, produces nanocrystalline films with unique properties.Very rough films are produced by conventional methods and to makethem smoother would slow the growth rate and interject graphiticphases into the finished product.  The Argonne films can be made asrapidly as the rough films but they are true diamond with verysmall grain size and are exceptionally smooth (as much as 17nanometers rms) even at film thicknesses greater than 10micrometers.  They do not need the expensive post-depositionpolishing required for conventionally grown diamond films.In this new process, diamond film is grown from fullerene moleculesinstead of from hydrocarbons such as methane.  The buckyballscollide and fragment into highly energetic carbon dimers (C2).  Thedimers then insert into the diamond lattice to form a new diamondlayer.  Since little hydrogen is added in the process compared withconventional methods, the resulting films have very low hydrogencontent and are high quality.Because of their smoothness, these films could be used as coatingsfor machine tools and bearings.  The films have been deposited onsubstrates such as silicon, silicon carbide, silicon nitride,tungsten and tungsten carbide.  Friction coefficients are as low as0.05 and, because of their smoothness, the wear rates of thecounterface material have been found to be as much as 100 timeslower than for conventional diamond thin films.  In addition, undera cooperative R&D agreement funded by the Dept. of Energy's (DOE)Office of Energy Research, Laboratory and Technology TransferProgram, Argonne and SI Diamond Technologies (Houston, TX) areevaluating the films as candidates for filed emission displays.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Another DiamondPatent for GEA microwave or flame-assisted method of depositing CVD diamond wasrevealed in U.S. Patent 5,464,665, issued November 11, 1995.  Theinventors are Thomas R. Anthony and James F. Fletcher and theassignee is General Electric in New York.Broadly, the present invention is directed to improving a chemicalvapor phase deposition (CVD) method for synthesis of diamondwherein a hydrocarbon/hydrogen gaseous mixture is subjected to acombustion flame in the presence of oxygen to at least partiallydecompose the gaseous mixture to form CVD diamond. The improvementin process comprises subjecting said combustion flame to one ormore of dielectric heating, d.c. discharge, or a.c. discharge.Dielectric heating can be accomplished by subjecting the combustionflame to microwave (MW) frequency discharge or radiofrequency (RF)discharge. By superimposing dielectric heating or d.c./a.c.discharge plasma generation on combustion flame process, the carbonutilization rate of the combustion flame process should improvesubstantially. As noted above, given the low carbon utilizationrate for combustion flame techniques already, small percentageimprovements in the carbon utilization rates translate intosubstantial cost savings in generation of CVD diamond by suchcombustion flame technique.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Diamond Nucleation byGas Phase SeedingDiamond films have been deposited on substrates withoutpretreatment by placement of a nickel wire above the substrate bya group in Germany, led by Ch. Woll (Institut fur AngewandtePhysikalische Chemie, Universitat Heidelberg, INF 253, 69120Heidelberg, Germany; email: cc1@ix.urz.uni-heidelberg.de), reportedin Applied Physics Letters.  The nickel wire was seen to increasethe nucleation density by five orders of magnitude.  Electronmicroscopy showed continuous diamond films to be produced withRaman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showing thepresence of Ni in the diamond phase.The diamond was grown in a standard hot filament CVD chamber witha tungsten hot coil and a resistively heated substrate holder.  Thesubstrate (100 or 111 silicon or Cu) was heated to 800-850oC, 5 mmfrom the filament.  Growth rates of 0.5-1 micron/hour were attainedin a 0.5% methane, 95.5% hydrogen at a 100 sccm flow rate.  Whenthe Ni wires were placed 0.5-1 mm from the substrate diamond wasseen to grow preferentially in the area in line with the Ni wireand the coil.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Carbon-CoatedMetal ParticlesResearchers at Northwestern University (Evanston, IL, Tel: 708/491-3115) have discovered a way to cover tiny pellets of metal withgraphite in an airtight fashion.  Electron microscope pictures ofthe pellets, which measure less than a millionth of an inch across,show layers of single atoms of graphite running around them.  Thepictures resemble bucky tubes, a relative of buckyballs.  Insteadof being hollow tubes, however, the spherical layers totallyencapsulate the round metal pellets.The pellets, called encapsulated nanoparticles, form spontaneouslywhen graphite is present during the process of vaporizing the metalparticles using a tungsten-based electric arc, according to theresearchers.  They believe the pellets could be used in a widerange of applications such as medicine, since they could travelthrough the human bloodstream without exposing the body to themetal contained inside.  They would be useful in MRI giving greaterclarity to images inside the body, and in anti-cancer therapy andcell separations which currently use larger magnetic particles.The discovery was described at the Fall Meeting of the MRS inBoston by graduate student Jon Host.  The research team was headedby D. Lynn Johnson and Julia Weertman, Walter P. Murphy professorsof materials science and engineering; Vinayak P. Dravid, associateprofessor; and Thomas O. Mason, professor of materials science andengineering at Northwestern's Robert R. McCormick School ofEngineering and Applied Science.The pellets have other possible uses such as magnetic strips oncredit cards, magnetic ink on checks, and in cassette tapes.  Thefinding was unexpected.  The original goal of the research was tomanufacture, analyze and utilize the tiny metal particles, whichmeasure 10 nanometers in diameter.  When a batch of nickelparticles was soaked in acid so it could be analyzed for anypossible contamination from the tungsten, it was discovered that ablack residue remained at the bottom of the container whichcontinued to be magnetic.When analyzed with the transmission electron microscope, theresearchers realized that the nickel particles had been insulatedfrom the surrounding acid by the layers of carbon atoms surroundingit.  The original findings were reported in the journal Nature.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Photoluminescencein Thin FilmsPhotoluminescence has been detected in thin films of partiallyoxidized silicon (Si) nanoclusters by scientists at the LawrenceLivermore National Lab (Livermore, CA 94550; Tel: 510/422-1100).The scientists, reports Lloyd L. Chase, synthesized Si nanoclusterswith average diameters of only a few nanometers (nm) using thermalvaporization of Si in an argon (Ar) gas background.  The firstmonolayer of Si nanoclusters was deposited directly onto the basalplane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, and the layer wasexposed to oxygen (O2) for five minutes.  Although, additionalmonolayers were added until the film thickness reached about 250nm, no photoluminescence was observed.Post annealing the film in O2 produced a white photoluminescence,which peaked at about 600 nm.  The photoluminescence increased inintensity as a function of annealing time and temperature up to850(C without any accompanying shift in wavelength.  The decay timewas less than five nanoseconds.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed extensive oxidation ofthe film, and the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of the filmshowed a strong resemblance to the optical absorption curve of bulkSi, except for an increase in absorption at wavelengths longer than375 nm.  The scientists attribute the photoluminescence to therecombination of carriers in localized defect centers in thesilicon oxide layer.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MRC TargetsWin CertificationMaterials Research Corp.

The team, headed by Keh-Yung Cheng (Tel:217/333-6642, Fax: 217/244-6375, email: kcheng@uxl.cso.uiuc.edu),have used molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and strain induced laterallayering ordering (SILO) techniques to build quantum wires,nanoscale atomic structures believed to dramatically increase theefficiency and reliability of light emitting devices such as laserdiodes.Many of the advances in computing, data storage andtelecommunications have come as a result of the evolution ofsemiconductor materials.  While silicon has been utilized tostretch the bounds of computer processing power and speed, othersemiconductors have been applied to create photonic devices.  Suchdevices can emit or detect light; for example, semiconductor laserdiodes can be used to read data from compact disks.Over the past 30 years, the techniques for creating thesesemiconductors have been refined.  Using an MBE method, scientistscan grow semiconductors in layers as thin as one atom.  Byselecting the types of semiconductor material, properties such asthe color of its light emissions can be engineered.An ultrathin layer, or quantum well, has done much to improve thereliability and efficiency of light emitting devices.  This quantumwell is the center of a semiconductor sandwich that is only a fewdozen atoms thick.  When structures approach this nanoscale,electrons begin to change their characteristics and exhibit quantumsize effects.  Such changes can affect and improve the overallperformance of optical devices, such as achieving more lightgeneration for a laser diode.The next step in quantum devices are structures that utilizequantum wires.  Similar to quantum wells, quantum wires have atomicscale thickness in two dimensions instead of one.  With thisadditional degree of quantum confinement, it is theorized that evenhigher levels of efficiency and reliability can be observed inpractical optical devices.The color of a standard laser diode's output light can vary withtime and temperature.  Quantum wire lasers, though, are thought tomaintain uniform characteristics over a broader range ofenvironmental variables.  Until now, very little success has beenachieved in preparing such quantum wire structures.In the Illinois work, the SILO process used MBE to growalternating, ultrathin layers, less than two atoms thick, insidesemiconductor structures.  The number of atoms in each layer isslightly different, either lesser or greater, than would normallybe required.  The resulting atomic imbalance creates a strain forceinside the growing crystal.  The strain force, in turn, causescertain atoms to group together along lines on the growing surface.When the SILO process is combined with quantum well fabricationtechniques in MBE quantum wire regions are formed almostautomatically.Cheng's group has demonstrated laser devices emitting in thevisible and infrared (IR) spectra range using quantum wires.  Thedevices, showed various new and unexpected optical characteristics,are the subject of further research at the university.  Eventualend uses may include improved supermarket checkout scanners andhome fiber optic communications.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996AT&T DevelopsStable Facet FilmsSilicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable for use as nonhermetic laserfacet coatings have been produced by researchers at AT&T Corp. (600Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ 07974; Tel: 201/582-3000).  NareshChand relates, in U.S. Patent 5,440,575, that the new films havelow levels of cracks, voids and particulate contamination and thatthey are stable in ambient atmospheres.The surfaces of nearly all semiconductor lasers must be protectedand/or modified.  Although dielectric films suitable for somedevices are widely used, e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO2) on silicon(Si), there is a need for a dielectric that is mechanically andchemically stable and free of pinholes, cracks, particulates andvoids.  It should also have good adhesion, be highly resistant tomoisture penetration and be adaptable for use as a semiconductorlaser facet coating regardless of emission wavelength.A number of materials, including yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ),have been proposed, but end up with shortcomings, including poorreproducibility with respect to refractive index and/or mechanicalstress and contamination with particulates.  In addition,conventional facet coatings are not normally stable in the ambientatmosphere, causing changes in laser properties and premature laserfailure.Because of the problems associated with conventional facetcoatings, nearly all such devices are packaged in hermetic, gas-filled enclosures.  These hermetic lasers are widely used inoptical fiber communications, optical interconnects, sensors, andprinting.  Hermetic enclosures add to the complexity ofmanufacturing processes, reduces yield, and increases the cost ofthe devices.  The AT&T researchers sought a highly reliable laserfacet coating stable in the ambient atmosphere.The AT&T scientists discovered that under the right processingconditions, high quality silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable foruse as laser facet coatings could be produced.  The key to theirwork was the use of a deposition by molecular beam techniqueinstead of conventional thermal evaporation processes.  The surfacelayer of the film is nearly always SiO2, but this layer normallyrepresents only about 10% of the entire film in most cases.  Ifparticular reflectivities are needed, the SiOx film can be combinedwith layers of other dielectric or semiconductor materialsdeposited using the same technique.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Single Crystal Films forHigh Frequency UsesAnother paper of interest to the thin film business was presentedat the Fall Materials Research Society Meeting.  It was part of theepitaxial oxide thin films symposium and was given by Y. Suzuki andcolleagues from AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey (Tel: 908/582-4633).Others involved in this research include R.B. van Dover, E.M.Gyorgy, V. Korenivski, Julia M. Phillips, D. Werder, C.H. Chen, andR.J. Felder.  The basic thrust of this work follows.High frequency filters that can be incorporated into integratedcircuits would ease design problems where power dissipation istightly budgeted.  In mobile communications, integrated filterscould have an impact on increasing performance while reducing sizeand cost.  These filters are composed of capacitors and inductors.While capacitors have been easily incorporated into integratedcircuit technology due to their planar geometry, inductorcomponents have not.The solutions have been either to use discrete inductor componentsor to simulate an inductor with a capacitor in an active circuit.The former solution raises size and cost, while the latter possiblyreduces performance and reliability.  Therefore, a high performanceintegrated inductor would be an excellent solution.To fabricate an inductor with a large inductance, a significantfield has to be generated over a large volume.  The researchers canincrease the inductance of a thin film device material by usinghigh permeability material.  There are other requirements for thematerials to be used in these thin film inductors.  To reducedissipative losses due to eddy currents, a magnetic material withlow conductivity has to be used.Other requirements include high saturation magnetization values atroom temperature and low magnetic losses.  Sinel structure ferritesare good candidates.  The successful growth of single crystalferrites in thin film form is an important step towards theirfuture incorporation into integrated circuits operating atmicrowave frequencies.The AT&T researchers have successfully grown high quality singlecrystalline spinel ferrite thin films of (Mn,Zn)Fe204 and CoFe204on SrTi03 and MgAl204 substrates at low temperature.  These ferritefilms are buffered with spinel structure layers that arenonmagnetic at room temperature.  Ferrite films grown on SrTi03 andMgAl204 buffered with CoCr204 and NiMn204 exhibit excellentcrystallinity and bulk saturation values, thus indicating theimportance of lattice match and structural similarity between thefilm and the immediately underlying layer.X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, atomicforce microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analysisprovide a consistent picture of the structural properties of theseferrite films.  The researchers have also incorporated these singlecrystalline ferrite thin films into device structures to takeadvantage of their high permeability.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Diffusion BarrierMethod PatentedAT&T, NJ, was issued U.S. Patent 5,468,689 on November 21, 1995,for a method for preparing a silicon nitride gallium diffusionbarrier for use in molecular beam epitaxial growth of galliumarsenide (GaAs).

Walker.The technique involves reacting nitrogen and silane in a ratio ofless than 300:1 in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor depositionapparatus to form a silicon nitride layer.  This layer is depositedon a reflowable glass layer previously deposited on a (100) siliconsubstrate oriented 3 degrees off axis and bearing a thin film ofsilicon dioxide.  Finally, GaAs is deposited by molecular beamepitaxial growth on the silicon nitride layer.

"This is by far thehighest operating temperature for an interband transition laser atthis wavelength," he explained. "We now have a device which workswith a compact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldycryogenic system, and room temperature operation is just around thecorner."The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-IIquantum well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVECand then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing thematerial growth and device design for diode lasers that can producesufficient power at 3-5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVECscientists are also testing a more advanced quantum- cascade laserdesign, which should produce higher-intensity light with lesselectric current, while emitting within either of two atmospherictransmission windows at 3-5 microns and 8-12 microns.Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicleand air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covertillumination for night vision, free space communications, and IRcountermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly inthese windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhousegas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical processcontrol, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IRsystems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compactIR sources are available.The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at muchshorter wavelengths. Long distance telephone networks use 1.3 and1.5 micron lasers in their optical-fiber systems, and a 0.8 micronbeam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible lightranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readilyabsorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmissionwindows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within thewindows are too bulky and expensive for most commercialapplications.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996PhotodetectorsSet a RecordA record low dark current operation of InGaAs (1.55 micron) p-I-nPhotodetectors on silicon and GaAs has been reported in AppliedPhysics Letters.  The authors, led by  F. E. Ejeckan (School ofElectrical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853;email: felix@ee.cornell.edu), fabricated the photo conductors byfirst bonding the p-I-n epitaxial layers, followed by chemicalremoval of the host InP substrate from the p-I-n structure, afterwhich the photodetector was fabricated on top of the exposed p-I-nlayers.Bonding of the photodetector to the substrate is done as efforts atheteroepitaxial growth have not met with success due to theinherent material defects present in devices grown by this method.Bonding eliminates these material defects but the films often aremechanically weak and thermally unstable.  The technique employedby the authors of bonding by atomic rearrangement (BAR) avoids thisweakness and obtains a covalently bonded interface free of defectsother than crystallographic misfit.Under 5 volt reverse bias, dark currents down to 57 pA on GaAs and290 nA on Si were measured.  A external quantum efficiency of 80%was deduced from the responsivity at 1.55 microns of 1 A/W, and theseries resistance across the bonded interface was 17 ohms for GaAsand 350 ohms for Si.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Laser Ablationof DiamondThin, electron-transparent layers of diamond for examination in thetransmission electron microscope (TEM) can be fabricated fromthicker diamond substrates by using a laser beam to ablate thesurface of the substrate according to work done at Caltech and theResearch Triangle Institute for NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab(Pasadena, CA, Tel: 818/354-2240).  Those involved include ThomasGeorge, Marc C. Foote, Richard P. Vasquez, and Edward P. Fortier ofCaltech, and John B. Posthill of RTI.An older method of laser ablation involved the use of photon energyabove the gap between the valence and conduction electron-energybands of the diamond substrate, but this method involves the use ofphoton energy below the band gap.  The growing interest in the useof diamond as a bulk substrate and as a coating material hasincreased the need for TEM for characterization of diamond-basedmaterials.  The below-band-gap laser ablation method may help tosatisfy this need, and it could also be applied in general tocutting and etching of diamonds.The basic idea is that below-band-gap radiation should not beabsorbed in the bulk of the substrate.  As a result, damage to thebulk of the substrate should be minimized and the major part ofabsorption of radiant energy should take place on the surface onwhich the laser beam impinges.  In experiments to test thefeasibility of the method, a pulsed, focused beam from a KrFexcimer laser was used to thin substrates of a type 1a naturaldiamond at normal and glancing (22() incidence.  The laserwavelength was 248 nm, whereas the band-gap wavelength of purenatural diamond is about 226 nm.The surfaces of the laser-thinned substrates were examined by useof scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The diamond substratesthinned at glancing incidence could be examined in this way withoutfurther treatment.  However, to render the substrate thinned atnormal incidence transparent to electrons, it was necessary toperform argon-ion milling to remove a layer of graphitic andamorphous carbon that had formed on the ablated surface.  (Thislayer apparently forms early in the laser ablation process andenhances the absorption of radiation at the surface).Back to Headline List CopyrightTHIN FILM/DIAMOND TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996OnTrak Ships FirstCMP Polishing SystemOnTrak Systems (1753 S.

Semiconductor lasers have advanced a long waysince their first demonstration in the early 1960s and have a largeimpact on many devices today.They act as sources for optical fiber systems and permit thereading of data from compact discs and barcode labels.  VCSELs havemany advantages over conventional semiconductor lasers.  The mostobvious is the possibility of very large arrays and a narrowcircular output beam, which can be efficiently coupled into thecore of a fiber.  As a result, the author believes that the timefor a book devoted to VCSELs has come.The first chapter of the volume describes the history and prospectsof VCSELs and the choice of material systems for emission indifferent wavelengths.  The second chapter concerns the opticalproperties of short vertical cavities, and the quantum mechanicalprocesses facilitating optical gain and spontaneous emissionprocesses are the focus of the third chapter.  Concepts aredeveloped from basic principles, and the effect of strain on theoptical processes in quantum wells is also covered.  Readers areintroduced to techniques for epitaxial crystal growth and thefabrication of VCSEL devices in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 exploresthe resistance problems that can arise due to the manyheterojunctions in dielectric reflector stacks.Chapters 6 and 7 are case studies which describe measurements madeon 2 VCSEL structures, one grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)and the other by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).In Chapter 8, experimental data from these case studies areanalyzed using models, and the final chapter describes otheraspects of VCSELs such as modulation response, arrays and noiseperformance.The book does a good job of covering the VCSEL field and should beof value to those experienced in the optics field, as well as tonovices and students.
