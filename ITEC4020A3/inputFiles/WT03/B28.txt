Their parents are interested in the product, and want to be surethat it has bona fide educational value, but the kids just want tohave fun.       How do you market two messages - educational and entertaining -about one product to two audiences?      Simple, says Cynthia Colmenares, vice president of sales andmarketing at Comfy Inc. Use one medium to carry two distinct messages.      The company, a creator of an electronic learning aid productwith add-on software that plugs into a PC or Macintosh, needed toemphasize to parents that its electronic activity center, whichretails for about $99, would definitely help their children on theroad to computer literacy, and to the mastery of many learning skills.      Yet, kids needed to know that the product would be fun to use.      Comfy launched a television commercial campaign on Cable NewsNetwork and Nickelodeon in which two streams of information weresimultaneously directed to the parents and the kids.      The voice-over in the first commercial, called "First Step," isdirected at parents, and talks to parents about watching their kidstake their first steps, utter their first words, and use their firstcomputer.      The visuals in the commercial, however, are directed at kids,which depict children having fun with their families and oldersiblings at the computer.      The visuals in the second commercial depict young and olderchildren laughing and playing with the product, while the voice-overonce again emphasized to the parent the educational values of theproduct.              Comfy made sure to broadcast the commercials at times when bothkids and parents would see t. They appeared Saturday morning andduring the early evening half-hour sitcom time frame. Comfy, whichbegan its TV ad campaign last year, is still running in the New Yorkmarket.       There are companies who do not try to market to the youngercustomer at all, saying that parents are the major purchasers, andmarketing should be directed at them.  Fisher Price, for example, saysit does not market educational toys to the 6 and under set becausethey believe the kids are just too young to absorb a marketingmessage.      There are ways to convey to kids that your educational productis fun, without actually conducting a formal marketing campaign,however.              While no marketing is specifically aimed at kids, companyspokesperson Linda Duttenhauer at Davidson & Associates, Inc., acompany which led the market with educational products such as its"Blaster" series of math and reading CD-ROMS,  said that there areways to communicate a sense of fun and play to kids.      The company points to the product's packaging, which arecolorful and contain characters that are fun and appealing to kids.Davidson has also created a Web site (http://www.davd.com) thatcontains a Fun Zone for kids to play games online.      An excellent example of a best-selling educational productmarketed differently to parents and kids may be Broderbund SoftwareInc.'s "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego," a CD-ROM product (withspin-off television shows and assorted products), that teaches kidsabout geography as they assume the guise of a detective and search forclues to find the elusive character. "Where in the World is CarmenSandiego" has sold more than 5 million copies since its debut. Thereare currently six different Carmen Sandiego software titles available.      The company, which pioneered in the educational software segmentin 1985 with the release of its first Carmen Sandiego product,targeted parents and kids in different ways, first by creating aproduct that contains the educational/entertainment balance.      Parent-focused ads, which appeared in consumer softwaremagazines such as Family PC, PC Magazine and Home PC, conveyed theserious but entertaining character of the CD-ROMs, in order to get parents to understand the educational benefit of the product, saidJennifer Apy, product marketing manager at Broderbund.       Interestingly, parents also need to know that the product isentertaining as well as educational, because, said Apy, "parents know'good for you' products are not kid-cool, and kids won't sit with it."      Comfy, which has plans to launch a product line for olderchildren ages 8 to 14 in '97, says it plans to market to both segmentsagain, since purchases of electronic toys and edutainment productstend to be family decisions.      "The main thing we have tried to do is look at the product anddesign and market it from the kids' point of view," says Colmenares.       This perspective makes sense, and seems to be reaching the kids:Comfy reports that they've had 6-year-olds call their 800 number tofind out more about the company's Comfy Activity Center.      Early on in the product's roll-out, in 1994, the company alsocreated pint-sized kiosks which it placed in retail stores, so kidswould be attracted to trying out the product. And, after becomingfamiliar with the characters in the software, the kids would geteverything from little rulers, to stickers to pencils, all with thename of the company and its phone number, and with pictures of thosecharacters.  In July 1996, the company also installed the kiosks inday care centers and Montessori schools to expose kids to the product.      The best educational product delivers the educational component,but makes the education transparent to kids.       To target  kids, and convey that the brand is  "cool,"Broderbund cultivates licensing agreements that keep the productsfresh and "cool" in the kids' minds. he licensing agreements includetwo fast-paced television shows, appearing on Fox Kids Network and thePublic Broadcasting System, as well as books, games and puzzles.      "You've really got to strike that educational-entertainmentbalance at the product level" before sending out dual marketingmessages, said Apy.

And when it is built and monitored correctly, kids can find theinformation they need easily, and companies can keep pace with kids bychanging their Web sites as fast as kids change their minds.      LEGO Systems, Inc., based in Enfield, Conn., the U.S. divisionof the Denmark-based LEGO Group, found this to be true when the LEGOWeb site went online in March.      Though kids had written to the maker of colorful, plastic bricksand construction sets to start a Web site, company officials insteadfirst informally monitored an unofficial LEGO user Web site to seewhat customers were saying about the company and its products. Usersvisited the unofficial Web site to talk about new products coming out,exchange personal opinions about products and hold auctions forhard-to-find LEGO sets.      After six months of planning, the official LEGO Web site wasopened (www.lego.com) - without a great deal of fanfare. The company'srationale was that a Web site is an extension of a company's brand,and a poorly executed or serviced site could affect how customers seethe company. Instead of making global announcements and finding itselfunprepared for the volume, LEGO proceeded with caution.              "If you set it up too quickly, and it's lousy, that's all thekids will remember," said Steve Hawco, director of direct marketingfor LEGO Systems Inc. "We were concerned that we would get inundatedwith traffic."      Instead, users found out about the Web site throughword-of-mouth and through exploring the Web, and LEGO saw heavytraffic on the site in its first few months.      Visits to the site peaked in June and July, and has reached asteady rate, attracting approximately 10,000 visitors a week, saidcompany representatives. The site is maintained in Denmark, thoughrepresentatives of the privately held company declined to share thecost of maintaining the site. Company representatives did say thatpart of the maintenance costs involve how often the company refreshesthe site, something LEGO Systems has not yet determined.Web site is a Give and Take      LEGO's Web site has been set up to both gather information onthe kids (and adults) that use its  products, and give kids and theirparents the opportunity to customize the information they receive fromthe company by allowing them to choose to receive information onproducts they select.      Along with providing information on the history of the company,and a worldwide listing of where LEGO products are sold, the Web siteasks kids their name, gender, age, where they live, the type ofcomputer they have, and whether it has CD-ROM capability. The company,which markets its products globally, asks for computer hardwareinformation so it knows what users around the world will be using tolook at the Web pages, and tries to take that into consideration whendesigning the pages.   The Web site is sprinkled with LEGO bricks and charactersthroughout, which underlies a basic principle of marketing on theIntenet - the Web site should extend the brand visually, usingfamiliar imagery, such as LEGO bricks in this case, but it also needsto go beyond that. The marketing challenge is how to take an existingbrand, and translate the feel of that brand onto a Web site to enhancethe brand.              "The entire presentation of the Web site should be in sync with,and true to the existing brand," said Tom Robbins, vice president anddirector of communications, Foote, Cone, & Belding/Los Angeles, aglobal advertising agency which has created Web sites for Levi Straussaimed at teens.      If you're marketing a brand with a cool, hip image, or aneducational brand identity, then the graphics, the pace, and even thelinks on the site should reflect that.       Using the colors and characters that kids associate with thebrand is just one way way to establish that continuity.       On the LEGO Web site, kids are asked to supply their e-mailaddress; if they do, they receive a membership certificate. They arealso asked if they want to receive e-mail on specific product lines,with a listing of those product lines. So far, said Hawco,approximately 25,000 users have registered their e-mail addresses.Targeting All Ages      One of the common frustrations of marketing a diverse productline such as LEGO's to a customer base that ranges from 3-months- to16-years-old is that kids within that group have very different needsand interests.      Taking that into consideration, the company maintains a freeclub, called the LEGO Club, for kids ages 5 to 12. When kids sign up,they receive a magazine called LEGOmania six times a year - which mustbe broadly focused to reach that entire group.       On a Web site, it's possible to create links to informationorganized by age group or product line, making it possible to talk tokids at an appropriate level, and specifically to their interests.       The real value in marketing to kids on the Internet is theability of  the electronic medium to give kids what they ask foralmost immediately, and - if the Web site is designed well - tocustomize the type of information they receive from the company.      "Because the Internet is new and interesting, marketers seem tohave forgotten their basic marketing lessons," said Andrew Watt, COO,Cyber Dialogue, an online consumer research and database marketingcompany in New York. "If you think of the Internet as a broadcastmedium only, you are missing its potential - which is, you can treatevery one of your customers as individuals. If you can get one-on-onewith your customer, and involve them in the marketing plan, you have amuch better chance of meeting their needs."      In addition to providing specific icons which relate toproducts, another way of tailoring information is to allow kids toselect whether they want to receive e-mail on a particular productline or new product launches, and by doing so, allow them to createtheir own personal marketing channel between themselves and thecompany.  And if you market your products globally, as LEGO does,there are several other considerations in designing a Web site.      Designers at LEGO had to grapple with which language to use,American or British English, (the company decided on American English)and how to design icons that would have universal appeal.(Steve Hawo, LEGO Systems, Inc., 860/749-2291, ext. 6799; Tom Robbins,Foote, Cone & Belding, 415/398-5200; Andrew Watt, Cyber Dialogue,212/804-1170)Working the Web1. Don't assume that demographic data gathered from your Web site isrepresentative of your entire customer base. One way to validate the data collected online is to hold traditionalfocus groups, and compare the results.2. Always pre-test the Web site on kids to solicit feedback, and tomake sure it has been designed with their needs and abilities in mind.3. Try to establish early on what type of computers most of the kidsare using to visit your Web site. Though kids generally demand lots ofgraphics on the Web, if their computers can't handle intensivegraphics, the site may download and function too slowly to retaintheir interest.4. Take advantage of the electronic medium to change, and refresh yoursite often - kids change fast, and your Web site should keep pace.    5.  Additionally, marketers who create online or Internet sites forchildren should become familiar with the advertising guidelines set forth by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Councilof Better Business Bureaus.Back to Headline List CopyrightSELLING TO KIDS via NewsNetOctober 16, 1996CONGRESSIONAL HEARING TARGETS DIRECT-MAIL KIDS LISTS      Marketers targeting kids 16 and under through direct mail,beware: the first congressional hearing was held last month inWashington D.C., on a bill which could affect how direct marketers dobusiness.      The bill, which was first introduced several months ago, seeksto prohibit the sale, distribution or rental of lists that containprivate information about kids without parental permission.      Proponents of the bills say it will protect children bypreventing others from using information gathered from lists to harmthem.  Direct marketing executives support some elements of the bill -such as a ban on the use of prison labor to process information aboutkids - but contend that if the bill is passed, the direct marketingindustry will be dramatically impacted, and so will kids - whocurrently receive direct mail on a wide variety of products. Congressadjourned without taking action on the bill, and marketers will bewatching when Congress convenes again to see if the legislation isreintroduced.

That is the conclusion of recent data collected by SimmonsMarket Research in their "1995 Kids Study."  The study surveyed 2,118kids on whether and how often they went grocery shopping, whether theyactually selected items to purchase, and the products in which theywere considered the "expert" in their family.      Marketers should consider actually observing kids in thesupermarket to understand their purchasing behavior.      Kids selected approximately five items per shopping trip -though 11% of 9- to 11-year-olds picked 10 or more items.      And when the kids are pulling products off the shelves, they aremost likely to pick breakfast cereals, candy and gum, and cookies -the top three categories kids picked from a list of 29 food products.      "You've got to watch the environment in which the purchasingoccurs," said Dr. Langbourne Rust, marketing consultant and consumerpsychologist specializing in kids. "Focus groups force thought to amuch higher level, but the challenge is to see how kids think whenthey aren't [forced]."      The supermarket and convenience store is a place where  kids'marketers can find success - if they understand the many simultaneousfactors that characterize kids purchasing behavior there. It's one ofkids most favorite destinations to make purchases in (perhaps becauseso many products there are actually within their budget). According toa report sponsored by Kurt Salmon & Associates, Discount Merchandiser,and Lisa Frank, Inc.,  kids ages 8 to 12 spent $378 annually on fastfood, groceries, snacks, candy and other food products. The 13- to17-year-old-group spent $633 - and the majority of those purchasestook place in either the convenience or grocery store.        According to the Simmons study,  54% of kids ages 6 to 8, 48% of9- to 11-year-olds, and 39% of 12- to 14-year-olds are considered theexpert in their family when it comes to breakfast cereals - notsurprising, since 90% of  American households have several varietiesof cereal in their homes at one time.        How do the cereal companies, and others attract kids' attentionwhile shopping in the supermarket?  Rust suggests a number of approaches:      * Directing information to the child sitting in the shoppingcart;      * Displaying products at cart height;      *  Designing packaging that encourages and supports childrenphysically interacting with it;       * Selecting product names carefully, so children can pronouncethem, and mothers can interact with their children (packaging withdistinctive colors, shapes and animals are good catalysts for mothersto talk to their kids about the product);       * Not relying on too much text on the product's packaging foryounger kids; and       * Using age-appropriate text for the older set.If you can get the kids to notice your product from furtheraway, thatworks, too, said Rust. Or, once kids approach the cereal aisle, forexample, distinguish your product by adding a kid-friendly feature,such as a handle on the box, which is perceived as an added-valuefeature. Candy companies do this when they package candy in a baseballhelmet or truck. The kids perceive the toy as added value. Marketers are not only targeting kids, they are also trying to keepone step ahead of all of the other cereal, candy, and cookie marketerson the shelves.      So, try watching what the winners are doing - and then do justthe opposite.      "It's a question of becoming distinctive, and it is enormouslycomplex and subtle," said Rust. "As soon as a marketing approachbecomes formulaic, the [marketer] that wins is the one that breaks theformula."

Back to Headline List CopyrightSELLING TO KIDS via NewsNetOctober 16, 1996FROM WALL STREET TO THE CLASS BEAT     It's a product recognized around the world, though most closelyassociated with board rooms, not homerooms.Bringing the Wall Street Journal into classrooms was not an easyassignment for Melinda Patterson Grenier, editor and publisher of  the6-yearold The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition. Grenier sought tochange kids' image of the Journal, and faced a complex marketingchallenge: how to market a product perceived by kids as being foradults only.     The goal was to see if the company could find a way to make theproduct more teen-friendly, and penetrate the classroom market aroundthe country. This would not only serve an educational mission, butbegin building brand loyalty to The Wall Street Journal.      The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition is targeted to highschool student from ages 14 to 18, though gifted kids in the fifth andsixth grades ages 10 and 11 are also reading it. The classroom editionconsists of a set of 30 copies of the newspaper per classroom, a20-page teacher's guide, and a free poster set, for $165 a year. Foran additional $135 per year, eight videos, which are designed in anewscast style, supplement the regular subscription package.     The company made the product more teen friendly - by not changinga word of copy, illustrating an important concept that many marketersmiss.     "Kids care about the same things as adults do - jobs, money,politics," said  Grenier. "They are sophisticated, and they don't wantto be talked down to. And you cannot go wrong by having higherexpectations for kids."     What the publishers did do was to talk extensively with kids, andteachers - who needed to be sold on the program - and found out howthe kids perceived the brand, and how that perception could bechanged, without compromising the editorial quality associated withThe Wall Street Journal.     The Classroom Edition reaches about 600,000 kids per month. In'91-'92, the Edition was in 1,200 high schools. In '96-'97, it is in4,000 high schools, or 16% of the high schools in the U.S. Not quiteas many readers as The Journal, which boasts a circulation of 1.8million.     Grenier, a former school teacher and reporter for The Wall StreetJournal, took the suggestions of kids and teachers, put together a16-page black-and-white prototype, and took it on the road toinner-city high schools in cities like Detroit, and elite high schoolsthroughout Illinois.             She listened to what the kids had to say, and followed asuccessful marketing research formula: though clearly the expert inher product, Grenier recognized the kids as experts in themarketplace, that is, they know all about what kids want.  The teenshad specific requests: they wanted color in the publication, a page onpolitics and policy, a page that would cover careers, and more casestudies and marketing stories.  All these suggestions have beenincorporated into the product.      When she handed out the prototype, which contained an articleabout a Tom Cruise movie and a story about McDonald's,  the kids lovedthe product, and thought it was written specifically for them.     In fact, the articles were exact reprints of those which hadoriginally appeared in The Wall Street Journal, though by repackagingthem according to content that would interest kids,  a kid-friendlyproduct was launched.       The publisher realized early on that in order for the product tobe successfully marketed to kids, the teachers in the classroom - whowould ultimately be the ones to purchase the product - would also haveto be included in the marketing and product development process, andbeyond.     A teacher's advisory board was formed, to advise the publisher onthe selection of articles. This last point is crucial, because theproduct not only had to appeal to kids, but had to fit into the schoolcurriculum and satisfy teachers. A Web site(http://info.WSJ.com/classroom/) was also created, with two icons, onefor teachers and one for students. (M.

"We feel it's important to instill good savings habits in kids,and we are hoping to create an awareness of this issue similar to therecycling campaign of the '80s," said Christine Cooke, vice presidentand manager of educational services, Merrill Lynch. "If they come toMerrill Lynch down the road, that's nice, but we are doing this as acommunity service."     Other advertisers include International Paper Co., TexasInstruments, Inc., Stanley Kaplan, and the Dreyfus Corp.       Advertisers have the option of taking out ads for an academicquarter,  a semester, a full year, or sponsoring posters, specialinserts, or even purchasing buttons on the Web.     A full page black-and-white ad costs $14,850. Sponsorship of aposter is $30,000. A button on the Web is $1,500 a month, and an ad inthe teacher's guide is $5,000 per page. A black-and-white ad in TheWall Street Journal could run upwards of $100,000.       Advertisers need to realize that kids represent a media-savvygeneration now. "What we are finding is that kids do not resent beingadvertised to - they resent being lied to, or being talked down to,"said Steve Russell, advertising sales manager for Classroom Edition. "The lesson is, you better talk straight to them, or you're done."      Grenier agrees that kids love learning about companies, enjoybeing consumers, and therefore enjoy the whole product - editorial andadvertising - but warns that kids today have a wider interest range. "There's got to be something in it just for them," says Grenier. "Theyare not going to read it just because it says The Wall StreetJournal."Back to Headline List CopyrightSELLING TO KIDS via NewsNetOctober 16, 1996CHILDREN'S TELEVISION WORKSHOP, CBS SIGN PROGRAMMING DEAL     Companies that can look beyond their individual marketingphilosophy - and focus on the larger picture - may find that a mergercan bring them new markets or add a new slant to their brand's image.     That is one marketing message behind the recent deal between CBSEntertainment and Children's Television Workshop (CTW), in which CTWwill develop at least three half-hour series for the network'sSaturday morning line-up.     The first half-hour show, targeted at 6- to 11-year-olds, isslated to appear in Fall '97.     CTW, which has built a reputation as the leader in children'stelevision programming with an educational flavor ("Sesame Street,""The Electric Company"), has typically chosen its corporate sponsorsand directed its  marketing initiatives carefully.     "We are very careful how we market ourselves to kids," saidAllyson Kossow Felix, vice president of marketing and communications,CTW, based in New York. "In the pre-school arena, we don't selldirectly to kids, and we don't let our own characters promoteproducts. And we would never team up with an alcohol or tobaccocompany."     For its part, CBS has initiated a drive to offer at least twohours of children's educational programming on its Saturday morningline-up. This initiative comes after the Federal CommunicationsCommission has pursued the networks to try and mandate a requiredminimum of hours for educational programming. The FCC has suggestedthat in 1998, three hours of educational programming per week berequired of the networks.     Independently of the CTW shows,  CBS is rolling out two new showswith educational content for '96-'97:  Secrets of the Cryptkeeper'sHaunted House" and "Bailey Kipper's P.O.V." Additionally, two existingeducationally-oriented shows, "Beakman's World" and "Storybreak" willreturn to the line-up.  In addition to the two hours of educationalprogramming, CBS offers such kids' shows as "Teenage Mutant NinjaTurtles,"  "The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat" and "The Lion King'sTimon and Pumbaa."     Yet CBS maintains it is already careful about the advertisementsthat appear on Saturday morning programming, which is generallylimited to cereals and toys.      "Unless a corporation decides to embrace educational TV as acorporate mission, we will probably not attract new advertisers," saidMichael Nowacki, vice-president of daytime and children's sales, CBS."There is very little image-driven advertising or image selling tokids. It is mostly product driven."     CTW has previously and successfully entered into agreements withother commercial networks - they currently have an hour-long cartoonshow running on the Cartoon Network called "Big Bag", and anothershow, "Ghostwriter," a literacy-based program, which appears insyndication - and insists that entering into the commercial domainpresents them with new marketing opportunities.     "I think, first and foremost, [the deal] goes right to CTW'scorporate mission, which is to be where kids are, and this means thatmore kids will get to see our programming," said Kossow Felix.      Though CTW's preschool programming on public television iscommercially uninterrupted, and the new shows on CBS will containcommercials, CTW maintains that older children can distinguish betweenprogramming and commercials.      CTW says that young viewers will not be confused by aCTW-produced show on a commercial network because children don'tnecessarily distinguish which network is providing the programmingthey enjoy.     And as long as two disparate companies marketing a producttogether have a commitment to maintaining the integrity of theproduct, there should be no marketing obstacles.     "Kids don't perceive our programming as 'spinach television,' "says Kossow Felix. "Kids are attracted to great programming, and aregoing to watch what they like. We are already on cable, PBS, thecommercial networks, we have magazines and we're online. We have ahome video relationship with Sony.  We live in the commercial world.We  recognize the power of our combined partnership." (CTW, 212/595-3456; CBS, 213/852-2028) Back to Headline List CopyrightSELLING TO KIDS via NewsNetOctober 16, 1996PBS BECOMES ADVENTUROUS AND 'VIRTUOUS' IN PRIME TIME     With animated shows like "X-Men" and "Bugs Bunny" catching kids'fancy, how might a show about virtues fare among pint-sized viewersand potential commercial partners?      The Public Broadcasting System, based in Alexandria, Va., isbanking on the success of its first animated primetime series,"Adventures from the Book of Virtues." It has already secured somepotentially lucrative merchandising and promotional deals and looks tobe positioning the animated series near the top of its programmingroster.     The primetime series premiere which aired in early September isadapted stories from The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great MoralStories ($27.50), a New York Times bestseller written in 1993 byWilliam Bennett.       Porchlight Entertainment, the producers of the series, wentfull-force with the PBS product, bringing in a number of marketing anddistribution partners including Reader's Digest, Turner HomeEntertainment and Warner Resound.  This series is the largest projectthat the upstart Porchlight has launched. Other Porchliht projectsinclude the Family Channel original "Night of the Twisters."     "We have approached this as a major programming event," saidWilliam Baumann, executive vice president and CFO of the LosAngeles-based Porchlight.  The partnership-wide launch, advertisingand promotion of the series will exceed $10 million during 1996 and1997.         PBS owns the home video, audio and visual rights and the rightsto promote the series.       The marketing push, which began nine months in advance of thepremiere, is aimed at both parents and children.  Parents, who may befamiliar with Bennett's book, expect to recognize the show's moral andeducational content.  And the show's animated characters shouldattract kids, according to Baumann.     Six episodes aired this year over the Labor Day weekend and willair again on Thanksgiving afternoon.  Seven new episodes will premierin January 1997 and an additional 13 to 26 episodes are expected for1997 and beyond. The show airs at 8 p.m. in most U.S. locations.     Philadelphia-based healthcare CIGNA Corporation, sponsors theseries, filling a 15-second advertising slot before and after eachepisode.     A major consumer product push starting in early 1997 will includestory books, coloring books, posters, magnets, activity kits, learningtoys and a series of home videos related to the PBS series. Initially, approximately 8,000 independent Christian bookstores,members of the Christian Bookstore Association have secured exclusiverights to sell the products through the Christmas season.  Thisexclusive retail opportunity was part of the deal between WarnerResound, a recognized Christian distributor, and Turner HomeEntertainment.  The products will find mainstream retailers in lateJanuary 1997.      Turner recently aired an infomercial on cable to promote a seriesof 13 home videos produced by Porchlight.  A series of 12 story booksfrom Simon & Schuster, the publishers of Bennett's book, will relateto characters and events in the series.       Hamilton Projects, a New York-based licensing and merchandisingagency, contacted major toy manufactures such as Hasbro Inc., Mattel,Playmates and Tyco to manufacture toys, board games, electroniclearning toys and activity kits related to the series. No deals,however, have been inked.      Products will achieve considerable success in the Christianmarket because the show's moral content appeals to Christianconsumers, according to Joanne Loria, senior vice president atHamilton.      The major element of the series' publicity campaign, led bysenior vice president Michael Gerrety of New York-based Hanson &Schwam Public Relations, was to "make [the show] appealing to familiesand children without making it too `kiddy.' "  Gerrety concedes thatyou cannot sell virtues to children. "The virtue and moral aspects ofthe show are included in the entertainment," he says.       Reader's Digest, making use of its vast household readership,will promote the show to a select group of consumers through a directmail campaign.       PBS will move the series from prime time to Sunday morningsduring the spring of 1997 and the first 13 episodes will run in aweekly cycle.       The first show, airing on 30 of the 33 PBS stations, managed a1.9 rating/3 share according to PBS.  Each rating point represents apercentage of television households that tuned in to "Adventures."     To keep parents and children abreast of the show's developments,a World Wide Web page has been created for the series(http://www.pbs.org/adventures). Porchlight received 500 e-mailresponses since the Sept. 2 premiere and Web site hits exceeded300,000.

A letter from VSDA President Lou Berg to chapter presidentssuggested that the locals "discontinue trade shows that areindependently sponsored by the regional chapters."  But anotherletter, coming from regional president Tom Daugherty of theSpokane, WA chapter before the meeting, says that to stop localretailers from sponsoring shows is to do them "a totaldisservice."     VSDA officials claim locals can still mount smallexhibitions as long as they're not called "trade shows," and theydon't charge more than $100 per table for member companies toexhibit.  Executive vice president Pam Horowitz says the regionalchapters approached the national association and asked for VSDA"to take an active role in the organization of their shows.  Manyshows have become too large for regional chapters to handlealone."     Connecticut Chapter President Ron Maslowski said before theLas Vegas meeting that "there's discontent all over the country"over the VSDA announcement.  "We had (a trade show) scheduled forMarch, and they told us in no uncertain terms to cancel it.  Theylike the big shebang to be (the national convention in) Vegas,and the movie studios now could be pulling back their money ifthere are too many of these local shows, so they made this move.But we would have all the small people at our show, the localcandy dealers and local label dealers.  If they can't come to alocal show, where can they go?  They sure aren't going to go allthe way out to Vegas."     Maslowski claims "we've had membership drop off becausethey're disillusioned.  They feel (VSDA) is for the big guy now."But after the Las Vegas showdown, Los Angeles chapter PresidentFina Damian says "everything was discussed and everyone was inagreement.  At first, they thought it was just going to be thefour shows (announced by VSDA), but the locals found outotherwise."     "I hear there will be eight to 10 shows next year, and thecities will rotate," says San Diego Chapter President HowardBregstein.  "The money is going for a justifiable cause--into thenational treasury to fight legal and legislative issues."  VSDAofficials say the money they take in from the five local shows(in Sparks, NV Feb. 26-27; Toronto Apr. 29-30; Chicago May 13-14;Atlanta June 12-13 and Austin, TX Nov. 13-14) will go back to thechapters.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990STUDIO PRINT CATALOGS PROMOTE SOME TITLES WHILE SELLINGMERCHANDISE     With such products as a chess set whose men are all LooneyTunes characters ($495) and "Star Trek" coffee mugs whosecharacters "beam up" as you add hot coffee ($12), merchandisecatalogs from studios have become a profitable cottage industry.Studios such as Warner and Paramount promote their catalogsactively.  But even studios which don't have major catalogs offersome collectibles through mail, at least through licensing deals.     There are occasionally products that tie-in directly tovideocassette titles, but the rule is more often to offer genericstudio merchandise or memorabilia connected to a current (orupcoming) theatrical release.  Sometimes the failure to providevideo offerings is based on a lack of communication between videoand theatrical divisions; other times, management doesn't see aparticular video-related offer as important.     Lorraine Brodek, director of consumer products for WarnerBros., says her company doesn't specifically try to promote videowith its catalog, but it doesn't rule out the possibility,either.  "We don't coordinate with videos generally, but we dohave "Lethal Weapon 2" product and "Batman" product listed in thecatalog.  Many times, public demand will dictate which titleshave merchandise tied-in."     Warner has promoted its catalog on rental cassettes, butmust walk a thin line to avoid upsetting some retailers who seedirect-response pitches as competitive.  An animated spot showsDaffy Duck walking the backlot at Warner Studios and urgingviewers to call for the catalog featuring Looney Tunesmerchandise and other Warner tie-ins.  Brodek says there has been"very strong response" to the on-cassette ads, but that much ofthe time, the interest is more in the Warner logo product than inany specific title-based merchandise.     At other studios, the emphasis shifts a bit.  Paramount, forexample, offered "White Christmas" tie-ins in its holidaycatalog, as well as boxed sets of such cassette series as "StarTrek", "Friday the 13th" and "Pee Wee's Playhouse" (not tomention the "Star Trek" MasterCard or "Friday the 13th"Spitballs).     MGM/UA tells VMN it's now updating its catalog, and thatsome video titles may be included in the marketing promotions.Even if a video title is listed in the catalog, the merchandisemay be left over from a promotion done when the film was intheaters.     "It's not necessary to think of it as a video title or atheatrical title; it's more a question of whether the title willhave the kind of following necessary to create a demand for themerchandise," says Brodek.  "The catalog is meant less as anattempt to promote the titles and more as an attempt to sell theitems we have listed.  We're targeting the customer who will beinterested in our products, so we keep the title above all elsein mind.  It doesn't matter if it's on video or in theaters."Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TOP 100 LIST SHOWS BEST-SELLERS at $2.7 BILLION, With 170-MILLIONUNITS SOLD     VIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER's annual chart of the top 100best-selling prerecorded videocassettes of all time (see chart,p. 4) dramatizes the overwhelming influence of sellthrough on thehome video market.  By Dec. 31, 1989, the list accounted for 170million units sold, an increase of 85% over last year's 92million.  And dollar volume, estimated at $2.751-billion for the107 titles on this year's list, was up 69% over the 105 titles onlast year's list.  (There are more than 100 titles on the chartbecause several titles tied at the cut-off point, 500,000 units.)     Last year, only 59 titles sold over 500,000 units, but bythe end of 1989, all 107 titles on this year's list had done so.In fact, the top 36 titles on this year's list sold over onemillion copies, a feat accomplished by only 18 titles last year.The top 10 titles accounted for 46% of the chart's total unitsales, and 38% of total factory dollars, as estimated by VMN.     But the impact of sellthrough pricing was clear, as theaverage factory price of a cassette plummeted from $21.22 lastyear to $16.19 this year, a 24% slump.  That drop compares to 10%in 1988 and 9% in 1987.     Two studios, Disney and Paramount, accounted for 56 of thetop 107 titles.  Disney/Touchstone alone racked up more than$900-million in estimated revenue from the titles on the chart,and itself accounted for a full third of the total revenue earnedby charted titles.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990CUMULATIVE NORTH AMERICAN TOP 100 UNIT AND WHOLESALE DOLLARVOLUME BY STUDIOStudio    # of    Unit Vol.   %       $ Volume    Percent(all     Titles     mil)   of Units  (millions)  of Dollarslabels)Disney     34       56.3     33.1      $909.7       33.1Paramount  22       26.3     15.5       461.0       16.8Warner     12       21.4     12.6       407.6       14.8MCA         6       20.5     12.1       349.0       12.7CBS/Fox    13        8.9      5.2       251.4        9.1MGM/UA      5        6.0      3.5       155.3        5.6RCA/Columbia3        1.9      1.1        57.9        2.1IVE         4        2.2      1.3        35.8        1.3HBO         2        1.2      0.7        20.8        0.8Others      6       25.2     14.8       102.5        3.7Source: VIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER     Noteworthy from this year's chart:     For the first time in history, no non-theatrical title madethe cumulative top 20 list.     The list is heavily peppered with short children's titles,accounting for much of Disney's strength.     The industry's maturity is obvious--as only 16 titlesreleased in 1989 were strong enough to muscle their way onto thelist.  Many evergreen titles scored substantial sales gain in1989, notably a re-released "Wizard of Oz" shipping more than 3million new units last year.     Only a handful of top titles came from companies not linkedto the seven major studios: Orion, IVE (Family HomeEntertainment), Western Publishing, Parker Bros., Video Reel (inbankruptcy) and Vestron (for sale).  Companies which are not amajor studio or a mini-major, or a toy company, have had littleluck in making the list.     When the chart first appeared, covering the period through1985, unit cut-off for the Top 100 was 110,000 units.  Four yearslater, the cut-off is more than four times that, up 30% from lastyear, and 53% from the 1987 chart.  List prices given are highestsince initial release, but in estimating studio revenue, VMN hastaken re-pricing into account.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990VIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER's Top 100 All-Time Best SellingVideocassettes                                HIGHEST  STUDIO    REL.

Pioneer LDCA announced thatMontgomery Ward would be stocking laser software in 44 of itsstores, but a spokesman for Ward reports that the company "hasbeen asked to consider carrying laserdisc software, but nodecision has been made yet."     A representative of Video Channels, the Pittsburgh-basedrackjobber which supplies both Ward and Sears, says "it's up tothe companies to announce" their plans, but confirmed that somelaserdisc product had been ordered by Ward for stocking bymid-February.     If it does stock laserdiscs, Ward would be the first massmarket retailer to offer the software, although hardware fromPioneer and other companies has been in place at Sears, JC Penneyand other stores for some time.  It could mean another step inthe ongoing effort of laserdisc to be a mass market consumerproduct.     The Video Channels representative could not confirm rumorsthat Sears was about to follow Ward's into the laserdiscbusiness.  A spokesman for Sears said the world's biggestretailer is "currently stocking Pioneer hardware, but not thesoftware, and we have no plans at this point" to start sellingdisc movies.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990RITE AID BACKS OUT OF VIDEO RENTAL, BLAMING LACK OF SPACE     The country's largest drug chain, Rite Aid (Shiremanstown,PA) is exiting the video rental business because it invites toomuch cutthroat competition and takes up too much store space,according to a company spokesman.  All this has led to a severedecline in profits in the 950 stores in which the chain rentedsoftware. Rite Aid operates 2,400 stores in the eastern half ofthe country.     According to the spokesman, the company will take a pretaxwrite off of $22-million in the third quarter on its video rentaldepartments.  He says that supermarkets, mass merchants and othercompetitors are offering video in more space and with morebreadth than Rite Aid can afford.  It will continue to offersellthrough titles.     The 1.5-million tapes in Rite Aid's inventory will be soldto consumers at $12.99 each, according to the spokesman.  He saysthe rental business seemed like a better idea in 1985, when RiteAid entered it, than it does today, particularly since theaverage specialty store devotes more than 5,000 square feet torental inventory, while the average Rite Aid store encompassesonly 6,700 square feet in its entirety.  Only a few hundred feetwent to video rental.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990MEDIA SIGNS AGREEMENTS WITH HANDLEMAN, VIACOM AND WEST COAST     Media Home Entertainment has been busily shoring up itsoperations, signing separate agreements with Handleman Co. todistribute and market the company's sell-through catalog, withViacom, for Media to market releases from Viacom Pictures andwith West Coast Video Duplicating to buy Media's Culver Cityduplicating facilities and to manufacture all Media's product forfive years.

A study released by Cambridge Associates (Stamford, CT)predicts that special-interest revenues will increase from $325million in 1989 to $420 million this year.  The bulk of theincrease will go to direct mail houses, direct response TV sales(on cable shopping channels or with 800 and 900 services) andother non-retail outlets.  Cambridge estimates direct responsewill account for more than one-third of all special interestvolume.  Supermarkets, which increased their market share 6% in1989, are the only retail outlets expected to increase marketshare in 1990.     New Line Cinema has become the ninth studio to sign a long-term contract with Request Television, the New York-based pay-per-view service.

New World Video and its sister company, New World Pictures,were sold shortly before the end of 1989 to Trans Atlantic Video,according to sources within the disbanding company.  New Worldissued pink slips to its remaining staff this month. There are noplans for the company to continue distributing productdomestically.     New World was sold to the Andrews Group in 1988, andnegotiations to sell it again began months later.  Video staffhad been pared down to a handful by the time Trans Atlantic Videobought the company in late December.  There were no immediateannouncements about the distribution of New World titles alreadyon the market, such as "Heathers," "Godzilla 1985" and "Lust inthe Dust."     "We've been in limbo for over six months," said one NewWorld executive. "The bad side is that you hate to walk away fromsomething that used to be good, but the good side is that we hada long time to prepare for it." When the company was "healthy andstrong," the executive says, "there were 25 or 30 employeesaltogether."  When the deal was consummated, there were six.

FOR SMALLSIZES     A low-end version of Steadicam, the Academy Award-winninginvention that steadies a hand-held camera to eliminate bumps andjumps, is now being marketed for the home video movie enthusiast.Steadicam, Jr., a hand-held apparatus that attaches to the bottomof a VHS-C or 8mm camcorder, has been introduced by CinemaProducts Corp., the company that developed and sells the originalprofessional model.     The camcorder version, which weighs less than two pounds,attaches to the bottom of the camcorder, and includes a viewscreen on the front of the unit that eliminates the need for theeyepiece.  A 3.5-inch LCD screen shows the camera operator theview being recorded by the unit.  The Steadicam also includes alow-intensity light that attaches to the back of the camera.     There are no plans to make a Steadicam for full-sizecamcorders, since the added weight of such a unit makes theoperation of a Steadicam impossible. Steadicam, Jr. lists for$549.  The company's Jac Holzman says the initial market for theproduct will be semi-professionals, using the unit at weddingsand other events.  It will be available first quarter this year.     But the key to the presentation is steadiness. After somepractice, the company's chairman Jac Holzman says, any operatorcan handle the Steadicam easily, and the camera "floats," using aseries of weights and balances. Basically a smaller version ofthe $40,000 professional version, Steadicam, Jr. is a system ofdistributed mass and balances, with the center of gravityprecisely placed above the floating inter-gimballed handleassembly. The handle, placed below the body of the camera, allowsthe operator to run or move with the action without bouncing thecamera or the image it records, Holzman says.PARAMOUNT'S KLINGENSMITH SEES PPV GAINING WHERE HOME VIDEORECEDES     Speaking at a pay-per-view convference in Anaheim lastmonth, Paramount Pictures video president Bob Klingensmith said aHarvard Business School survey commissioned by Paramount predictspay-per-view will increase its market share while home videobegins to fade.     Klingensmith went on to say that PPV is central to thefuture of movie studios in general, and that it should be apriority among all film companies "if we're going to continue tomake bigger movies with bigger stars." He compared the doubledigit inflation of filmmaking with the single-digit growth ofmarkets including home video and said relying on homevid andother markets and ignoring PPV "won't let us catch up with thatkind of cost rate."     PPV is expected to increase by 750 percent by 1993,according to the Paramount president, but he estimates that itwill still be only one-tenth the size of pay-TV and four percentthe size of home video. Klingensmith urged other movie companiesto raise the priority of PPV, suggesting that by 1995, it couldbe a $1-billion business for motion pictures alone, discountingspecial events and other PPV alternatives. Among the steps hesuggested should be taken to push PPV along were direct mail andprogram guides to inform the public, advertising on cablestations, setting aside preview channels for future use andpushing to get PPV listed in TV grids. He did not mention anyfurther drop-off in home video revenues, although the Harvardsurvey, which he said was commissioned to get "an unbiased look"at the alternatives, saw homevid losing ground to PPV in comingyears.    *Australia may be getting pay-TV soon, as a governmentcommittee recently okayed the implementation of such a system.Still, the Federation of Commercial Television Stations (FCTS)has called for a delay in cable installation.

Here's a sampling of the videonews from around the  globe:COMPANY ANNOUNCED INTENTION TO MARKET VIDEO ON DEMAND BY END OF1990     The Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas may--ormay not--have seen the first shot fired in a new technology warthat could conceivably change the entire business of videosoftware distribution.  A company called Entertainment MadeConvenient 2 (EMC2) Inc. (Denver, CO) says it is ready andwilling to begin transmission of Video On Demand by the end ofthis year.     Company co-founder and vice chairman Will Gravenand some investors have put together a plan which would requirethe end user to purchase a new VCR and satellite receiver.  Oncethe hardware is in place, Graven told a hastily-called CES pressconference, a telephone number is called and an eight-digit codespecifying the program to be sent is punched in.  The videoprogram is then down-loaded into the VCR via satellite at a rateapproximately 10 times that of real time (a 2-hour movie would besend in 10 to 20 minutes).     Graven admitted EMC2 had not yet licensed the technology toany hardware manufacturer, and that no software studio had signedon to provide programming.  But he says there are advantages toboth ends of the distribution chain, and he has seen "greatinterest" from hardware and software suppliers. "We will be theelectronic video rental store," he says. "The studios we'vetalked to have been very interested because above all else, weoffer them security.  Macrovision is built-in, and the tape willerase itself on the second play.  And we'll pay a royalty on eachand every transaction.  All the program supplier will need is aPC hooked up to our mainframe." According to Graven, the hardwaremanufacturers will find it very simple to add the chips necessaryfor his system to existing assembly lines. "It will not requirenew assembly lines or new buildings. The S-VHS or 8mm chassisthey're using now will work very well. And the new generation VCRthey make will receive and record digitally."  While it'spossible for manufacturers to build in such now standard VCRfeatures as record, timeshift and standard playback, Graven sayshe expects the first units to be made strictly for the EMC2system. "Later on, they'll probably add in the other functions."Initial retail cost for the VCR and satellite receiver (currentsatellite users can keep their existing receiver) should bebetween $1,200 and $1,500, he estimates.The satellite systemshould work even better than proposed fiber optic video deliveryoperations now being tested, according to Graven.  "Everybodysays the answer is going to be fiber optics, but very quicklyafter you start with fiber optics you have traffic problems."  Hesays that the EMC2 system eliminates depth of copy and breadth ofcopy as problems because the consumer will never have the systemtell it a title in the catalog is not available.  For consumerswho wish to rent a title, a button can be pushed in the initialtransaction informing the system that the erase function shouldnot be built into the transmission.  The system will then billthe consumer for the retail price of the program.  Rentalprograms should be "comparable to current rates," says Graven:about $3 for a current hit, $2 for something from catalog and$1.50 for a one-hour non-theatrical program. Graven says thesystem will be ready to run by late Third Quarter 1990.  Untilhardware and software manufacturers are licensed, however, therewill be no system to start up.  And there has been no indicationfrom any software or hardware supplier that any agreement isimminent.  Graven claims to have been negotiating withmanufacturers and studios for two years, but declines to mentionany company names until contracts are signed.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990VSDA TO SPONSOR LOCAL SHOWS; REGIONAL CHAPTERS REACT ANGRILY     Some retailers are voicing anger at the VSDA for its recentannouncement that the trade group will sponsor its own localshows. Chapter officials say they're being cut out by the parentorganization while VSDA officials say their intention is to doanything but that.     Retailers say they're less upset with the sponsorship byVSDA than they are with the association's suggestion that members"discontinue trade shows that are independently sponsored by theregional chapters." VSDA president Lou Berg made that suggestionin a letter to regional chapter presidents.  Another letter,coming from regional president Tom Daugherty of the Spokane, WAchapter, says to stop local retailers from sponsoring shows is todo them "a total disservice."     VSDA officials claim members can still hold exhibitions on asmall scale, as long as they're not called "trade shows," andthey don't charge more than $100 per table to exhibit.  Executivevice president Pam Horovitz says the regional chapters approachedthe national association and asked for VSDA "to take an activerole in the organziation of their shows.  Many shows have becometoo large for regional chapters to handle alone. Our intention isto contribute our expertise and professionalism in handling theseshows."     Connecticut chapter president Ron Maslowski says "there'sdiscontent all over the country" over the VSDA announcement. "Wehad (a trade show) scheduled for March, and they told us in nouncertain terms to cancel it. They like the big shebang to beVegas, and we see the movie studios now could be pulling backtheir money if there are too many of these local shows, so theymade this move. But we would have all the small people at ourshow, the local candy dealers and local label dealers in thestate. If they can't come to a local show, where can they go?They sure aren't going to go all the way out to Vegas."     Maslowski goes on to claim that "we've had membership dropoff because they're disillusioned. They feel (VSDA) is for thebig guy now. It's going to hurt in the long run." VSDA officialssay the money they take in from the five local shows (in Sparks,NV Feb. 26-27; Toronto Apr. 29-30; Chicago May 13-14; AtlantaJune 12-13 and Austin, TX Nov. 13-14) will go back to thechapters.

San Diego Chapter President Howard Bregstein tells VMN hewas "pretty upset when I heard" that VSDA national would sponsorfour regional shows this year, and that the organization wasurging its regional chapters to avoid sponsoring their own tradeshows.  But after he voiced his disapproval at the Las Vegasmeeting, Bregstein says, he realized the guidelines set down bythe national association are not as strict as he'd feared.     "A lot of things were due to a lack of communication," saysBregstein. "They're not telling you you can't run your ownexhibition; they just don't want you to call it a trade show.  Ithink (after the meeting) the national board of VSDA understandsthe nature of the regionals a little better."     Bregstein says he was among those alarmed at the thoughtthat only four regional shows, in cities chosen by VSDA, would beheld every year.  At the meeting, he says, he found out that waswrong. "They discussed nothing but the regional trade show issueall morning," he says.Back to Headline List WT03-B28-3IA059-000320-B033-197http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae29.html 205.156.212.5 19970114195853 text/html 34375HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 19:57:00 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:26 GMTContent-length: 34188Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae29.html Sample Issue Copyright AEROSPACE DAILY via NewsNet January 2, 1996 Vol. 177, N SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES HILL'S CHOICES ON VETO: A QUICK FIX OR POSSIBLY NO BILL (384 words) PHILIPPINE AIRLINES IN $3 BILLION DEAL FOR 32 AIRBUS, BOEING JETLINERS (116 words) RUSSIA, CHINA LAUNCH U.S., INDIAN SATELLITES (106 words) CHIEFS' PROCUREMENT PUSH A CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITY FOR FY '97 (605 words) FOR PENTAGON IN '96, BOSNIA AND THE BUDGET WILL BE KEY (513 words) PLUS CA CHANGE: STEADY CONSOLIDATION IN STORE FOR AEROSPACE (599 words) ARPA PUSHING MULTI-CHIP MODULES, MEMS, LOW-POWER DEVICES (541 words) 1996 SHAPING UP AS A BIG YEAR IN SPACE, WITH PITFALLS (660 words) WHAT'S AHEAD IN AEROSPACE FEELING FLUSH (90 words) BUSY, BUSY (112 words) SLOW START (68 words) RUSSIAN TALKS (115 words) NASA'S PLAN (115 words) POWER PROFILE (103 words) JAPANESE SPENDING (59 words) END IN SIGHT?

Clinton vetoed the bill largely because of its provisions for "a costlymissile defense system able to defend 50 states from a long-range missilethreat that our intelligence community does not foresee in the comingdecade." The bill called for developing a national missile defense (NMD)system for deployment in 2003.   The president also complained about provisions requiring the dischargeof all service members who test positive for HIV, the virus causing AIDS,and restricting his authority to put U.S. troops under United Nationscommand.   Senate Armed Services ranking Democrat Sen. Sam Nunn (Ga.) warned of theveto threat over NMD all year and at one point during the conference,congressional sources said, chastised Republicans for being more interestedin a campaign issue than in getting a bill.   Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), chairman of the House National SecurityCommittee's research and development subcommittee and the leading Housenegotiator on missile defense, said the Republicans conceded every NMDissue to the White House except the call for deployment by a date certain.Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), chairman of the procurement subcommittee,said the Republicans wanted to do away with "the research-foreversyndrome."   "I remain committed to enacting a defense authorization bill for thisfiscal year and will immediately begin work with my colleagues toward thisend," House NSC Chairman Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), said in a statementissued after the veto last Thursday.   Spence could not be reached for comment Friday. It was not immediatelyclear whether he and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) would seek to reconvene the conference shortly after the start of thenew session tomorrow or wait until the week beginning Jan. 22 when theHouse was scheduled to return for the President's State of the Unionmessage.   Starting later raises the possibility that various interests mayseparately conclude they are better off with no bill at all. For example,some proponents of additional B-2 stealth bomber production might prefer nobill to possible restrictive language against further B-2 production.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996   Vol. 177, NPHILIPPINE AIRLINES IN $3 BILLION DEAL FOR 32 AIRBUS, BOEING JETLINERS   Philippine Airlines is close to finalizing a $3 billion aircraft orderfrom Airbus Industrie and Boeing, although only Airbus has confirmed thedetails of its share.

Priority for the House National Security and Senate Armed ServicesCommittees will be rewriting that portion of the FY '96 authorization thatprovoked the veto, primarily the ballistic missile defense section. Butonce that is out of the way, the FY '97 budget will be next on the agenda.   The White House is expected to send its defense budget to Capitol Hillearly in February. There is a surprising degree of consensus in Congress,and in the Pentagon as well, that lawmakers should adhere as closely aspossible to the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that procurement beboosted 50% to $60 billion in FY '98, two years ahead of the ClintonAdministration's schedule.   The Joint Chiefs made the recommendation in a budget assessmentsubmitted in November by their chairman, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, toDefense Secretary William J. Perry. Their concern is two-fold: thatexisting modernization projects have been delayed by a lack of funds, andthat projected savings elsewhere in the budget may not be realized to freeup monies for increased procurement   The Administration requested $38.7 billion for procurement in FY '96, afigure Congress boosted $5.4 billion to $44.1 billion in the defenseappropriations act. Rep. C. W. (Bill) Young (R-Fla.), chairman of the HouseAppropriations national security subcommittee, said in an interview thateven while Congress "won't be able to increase the top line," he will tryto increase procurement funds within those numbers.   The congressional budget resolution set the national security FY '97ceiling at $267.3 billion in budget authority and $265 billion in outlays,a rise of $2.6 billion in authority and $1.7 billion in spending. Youngsaid he plans to call the service chiefs to testify on their request forspeeding up the procurement increase.   "For them to make this kind of a request and do it publicly is veryunusual," he said, predicting the Chiefs' testimony will swing a lot ofweight on Capitol Hill. "That says to me that they're really serious aboutthis."   The Senate panel made its intentions clear in its fiscal 1996 report when it said DOD "decisions to cancel or delay modernization programscreate unrealistic modernization funding requirements for the future."   The Armed Services Committee noted its $5.3 billion procurement boostand $1.7 billion increase in research and development, and said it believesthat DOD "must continue to fund these accounts at similar, inflation-adjusted levels in future budget requests."   House National Security Chairman Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.) said he alsointends to focus on the Joint Chiefs' request to accelerate themodernization increase. Like Young, Spence said the projected procurementincrease would have to be achieved without raising the top line.   Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), chairman of the House NSC research anddevelopment subcommittee, said his panel will hold hearings on theatermissile defenses, exploring command and control and the problem ofdifferentiating between strategic missiles, which are restricted bytreaties, and theater types, which are not.   Weldon said he is assembling a team of outside experts to tackle theintelligence community "head on" over their assessments of the Russianmilitary.   "My impression right now," he said, "is that the intelligence communityis sanitizing reports to Congress because it wants to support the Russianleadership."Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996   Vol. 177, NFOR PENTAGON IN '96, BOSNIA AND THE BUDGET WILL BE KEY   The Defense Dept. will spend much of 1996 dealing with Bosnia operationand its $2 billion pricetag. As troops try to keep warring factions apart,planners back at the Pentagon will be trying to reprogram funds to pay forthe effort.   Congressional approval for a reprogramming will be required, andCongress will certainly have a say in the source of the offsets. DefenseSecretary William J. Perry says he wants to take the money from unrequestedfunds that Congress provided for fiscal year 1996, including long-leadmoney for more B-2 bombers, but he may have trouble doing it.   Another issue that will pit the Pentagon against Congress is the DODplan to reduce the number of theater missile defense programs in its fiscal1997 budget, which is slated to go to the Hill early this year. The movecomes as Congress is pushing hard for missile defense.   Congress hasn't been entirely supportive of one TMD program, Corps SAM(or MEADS) - Senate authorizers proposed zeroing it. But it does enjoysupport at the Pentagon, and, because of its international dimension, isn'tabout to be cut.   This election year isn't likely to see many defense programs on thechopping block, or even many controversial program decisions, for thatmatter. Some of the high stakes decisions were made last year, when thePentagon decided to buy only 20 B-2s and to go for more C-17 airliftersrather than a Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft.   Still, some key decisions are slated for 1996. Among the most closelywatched will be the downselect in the Joint Advanced Strike Technology(JAST) program's concept demonstration phase. But even though one of thecompetitors - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and a team headed by McDonnellDouglas - will be knocked out, many expect the loser to keep an alternativealive in case JAST hits a snag.   Munitions programs will also be in the spotlight. The Pentagon willaward two pre-engineering and manufacturing development contracts for theJoint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) program late in the year,kicking off the effort in earnest. The final downselect in the AIM-9XSidewinder competition will also be made a year's end, leaving a candidatefrom Hughes, or Raytheon, or a derivative of the British ASRAAM, to bedeveloped as the new U.S. Air Force/Navy short-range air-to-air missile.   Pentagon observers will also be watching to see what happens to theJoint Requirement Oversight Council. Headed by Adm. William Owens, the vicechairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the JROC has had major input in themerging of service requirements. But industry and DOD officials aren'tcertain what Owens' impending retirement will bring, and whether hisreplacement, Air Force Gen. John Ralston, will have the same fervor forprogram consolidation.   Also, while the Pentagon in 1996 will probably stick with its strategyof fighting and winning two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts, achange to a more modest goal is expected to come in 1997. Such a shiftwould almost certainly prompt changes in the force, as well as therestructuring of programs.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996   Vol. 177, NPLUS CA CHANGE: STEADY CONSOLIDATION IN STORE FOR AEROSPACE   If you're an aerospace CEO with cash burning a hole in your balancesheet, 1996 may be your best year for a merger or acquisition, but thatdoesn't mean the slow, steady consolidation of the 1990s will give way to amad rush to close deals this year, financial analysts and industryexecutives agree.   "1996 probably won't be all that different from 1995," says MerrillLynch VP Byron Callan, who predicts "one or two surprises" on the scale ofRaytheon's acquisition of E-Systems last spring, "one big multi-industrydivestment," such as Westinghouse's break-up, and "a whole bunch of smallerdeals," along the lines of Litton's buying PRC for $425 million, or Thiokolbuying Howmet.   What's different this year? "The big thing is just the valuations,"Callan says, echoing other Wall Streeters who think the $2.3 billionbenchmark Raytheon set for defense electronics acquisitions "is going tostick."   Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, defense and aerospacecompanies spent most of their energy downsizing, and selling off pieces forcash - "monetizing," as restructuring leader General Dynamics described it- but so far very little of that cash has been spent. Coupled with amodestly improving defense and aerospace outlook, that leaves a lot ofeager buyers and few sellers.   "ITT is basically frozen out of doing anything" because of the terms oftheir existing restructuring plans; "TRW has pretty much said flat out theydon't see the need to do anything rash," and "most of the managements ofbig publicly traded companies have said they want to remain independent,with Northrop Grumman being the prime example of that," Callan says.   He recently told clients that the scarcity of sellers and the highprices that will be paid to close deals will have "mixed implications" fordefense and aerospace companies and their shares, "benefiting those stocksviewed as takeover candidates, while possibly harming those that rely ongrowth via acquisition," such as Loral and Tracor.   While those factors will temper the enthusiasm for mergers andacquisitions, there are also plenty of reasons to get deals done soon.Interest rates are low, and 1996 will be the last relatively quiet periodbefore election-year uncertainty takes hold.   "From a seller's standpoint, can sellers sit back and wonder if they'regoing to get as good a deal in 1997 or 1998," Callan says. "There are a lotof hypotheticals out there."   There will be a new Administration; there may be a Republican in theWhite House, and there may even be another Bottom-Up Review of defenseplans and programs after the new team takes over. The longer sellers wait,Callan argues, the more likely it is that buyers' enthusiasm will wane.   Even so, the lull will be temporary, and some analysts looking just alittle further into the decade think there may be a whole raft of newdefense properties coming on the market. The 1990s saw several bigcombinations - Martin Marietta buying GE Aerospace, followed by the newcompany's merger with Lockheed; Northrop buying Grumman, and then buyingVought; Loral buying IBM Federal Systems - and some of those combinationsmay begin to unwind in a few years.   "Bigger has proven better for shareholders, but we wonder just how muchof a competitive advantage it has imparted to those who have embracedconsolidation," Callan says. "If there are two or three more big deals in1996, we think that an issue for investors to start pondering is whetherthe new defense empires might be better able to unlock value by insteadbreaking themselves up."Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996   Vol. 177, NARPA PUSHING MULTI-CHIP MODULES, MEMS, LOW-POWER DEVICES   Defense electronics will both push and be pulled by the commercialmarket in the coming year, drawing on dual-use technologies capable ofsatisfying military requirements for customized, compact, rugged, portableinformation subsystems, either embedded in military weapon systems orcapable of providing tailored information services to military personnel.   Lance Glasser, director of ARPA's Electronics Technology Office, sayscheaper, smaller and faster electronics will create markets beyond today'sapplications and enable information technology to be applied to newdomains. Despite the pull of commercial technologies, DOD-uniquetechnologies, as well as technologies in which DOD needs to lead the stateof the commercial art, will continue to exist.   The emerging technology of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) iscreating families of microscopic sensors and actuators capable ofinterfacing directly with microprocessor-based advanced informationprocessing systems for both military and commercial applications.Commercial applications are leading the way. Goodyear, for example, isdeveloping passive sensors that would be embedded in truck tires to monitorpressure, temperature and tire wear and to provide a unique identificationcode for each tire as an anti-theft measure.   "Coupled with advances in wireless communication, low-power electronicsand conformal/embedded manufacturing, this miniaturization will not onlylead to improvements in the operation and maintenance ofequipment/processes and increased sensing capability over wide areas, butalso to applications in broad areas ranging from personal inertialnavigation systems to microsatellites," says Kaigham J. Gabriel, MEMSprogram manager at ARPA.   Success to date with its Multi-Chip Module (MCM) development program tointegrate digital and analog components in the same package has led ARPA topush for an end-to-end capability in Application Specific ElectronicModules (ASEMs) in a variety of military applications.   Principal goals for ARPA's ASEM program this year call for creating afull service merchant capability, including design, manufacture and test;cutting the non-recurring engineering (NRE) time five- to 10-fold from 1992levels and NRE costs at least five-fold to less than $25,000. Clock speedis to be pushed up five-fold to 500 MHz.   ASEMS are the successor to Application Specific Integrated Circuits(ASICS), and among the trends that ARPA sees driving the new markets forASEMs are increased portability of electronic products, greater concern forthe form factor as the products are reduced in size, increased use ofbattery-powered wireless products, merging of computing and communications,greater demands for reliability and anticipated reductions in the cost perfunction of around 50% every 18 months.   In anticipation of expanding demands for low power devices for a widespectrum of military applications in mobile, wireless electronic products,ARPA last year launched a program to create an industry-wide technologybase.   The goal of the program, designated Low Power Electronics, is to enablethe electronic portions of future systems to dissipate two orders ofmagnitude less power than is possible today with conventional technology-while at the same time maintaining at least parity with current systems insuch performance metrics as clock frequency, bandwidth and noise margins.   According to Zachary J. Lemnios, low power program manager at ARPA,applications of the near-term future build on such existing commercialproducts as hand-held GPS navigation devices, the constantly shrinkingpersonal computer, mobile communications devices with global reach andhealth monitors and other biomedical devices.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996   Vol. 177, N1996 SHAPING UP AS A BIG YEAR IN SPACE, WITH PITFALLS   Events planned over the next 12 months promise to shape internationalspaceflight for decades to come, but just what that shape will be dependson the outcome of missions and commercial ventures set for launch in 1996,and on decisions to be made in the White House, on Capitol Hill, and in thepolling places of the Russian Federation.   By the end of the year the first of the "Big Leo" communicationssatellites should be in low-Earth orbit; Europe's Ariane V should be anoperational launch vehicle, and the configurations of the next-generationU.S. launchers should be a lot clearer.   However, the future of the International Space Station remains murky.NASA managers - with the White House watching carefully over theirshoulders - must find a way to keep Russia in the program now that theyhave rejected a cost-saving proposal to plug Mir into the configuration(DAILY, Dec. 26). And the economic reforms at the heart of Russia's spacepartnership with the rest of the world will be put to the test in June,when Russian voters pick a president as Boris Yeltsin's term expires.   In January, 10 years after the Space Shuttle Challenger was lost, theShuttle built to replace it is scheduled to lift off on a mission devotedin part to testing tools and techniques for Station assembly (DAILY, Dec.21). As Endeavour orbits overhead, Shuttle managers on the ground will havestarted work in earnest to transfer Shuttle operations to United SpaceAlliance, a joint venture created to take on the job, by September (DAILY,Nov. 8, Dec. 1).   The Shuttle prime contract is but one effort to trim fat from NASA'sbudget so it can mount a "balanced" program while building the Station. InFebruary, NASA's Office of Space Science will launch the first of its"faster-better-cheaper" Discovery platforms, the $150-million Near EarthAsteroid Rendezvous (NEAR), toward an encounter with 433 Eros in January1999.   But in the end it will be the Congress that decides whether the Stationis built. With the U.S. government in budget gridlock as the new yearbegins, the $2.1 billion-a-year Station pricetag seems particularlyvulnerable. And the squeeze on NASA spending will become even tighter asthe agency decides which of three competing designs it will build as its X-33 reusable launch vehicle (RLV) prototype.   In April the subscale McDonnell Douglas DC-XA will return to the skiesover White Sands, N.M., for a series of vertical takeoff and landingflights designed to test materials for the X-33 (DAILY, Dec. 16, 1994). Bythen the troubled X-34 program should be back on track (Dec. 11, 14),giving the U.S. two shots at developing the world's first commercial RLV.   Big spending in government civil space programs like the Station andShuttle notwithstanding, the end of the Cold War continues to openopportunities for commercial space operations. Last year the U.S. launchedmore commercial than government expendable launch vehicles, and the trendwill continue in 1996 (DAILY, Dec. 22). Abroad, Ariane V is scheduled tofly for the first time, and a Russian Proton will launch its first Westernsatellite.   The launch glut is good news for satellite-makers, who have a lot ofhardware to orbit. In September a Delta II is scheduled to launch the firstbatch of Iridium communications satellites to LEO, with another flightscheduled in November, while competitor Globalstar should be putting thefinishing touches on its platforms for a first launch in mid-1997.   In the U.S. alone, the Aerospace Industries Association expectscommercial programs to pace a $1 billion rise in space-sector sales, to $28billion for the new year. Profits of a different kind should come in earlyin the year, as NASA scientists locked out by the government shutdownfinally get to report the first results from the Galileo spacecraft's probeof Jupiter's atmosphere. Spectacular images of the Jovian system willfollow in the months to come.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996   Vol. 177, NFEELING FLUSHLargely absent from last year's customer list, U.S. carriers can beexpected to start dusting off long-postponed plans to buy new aircraft andengines.

In the 1990edition of the agency's U.S. Industrial Outlook, CommerceDepartment experts predict the value of aerospace productshipments will climb from $105.7 billion in 1989 to $114.2billion in 1990.  That represents a gain of 3.8 percent afteradjusting for inflation.      The report, which looks at very large segments of theaerospace industry, gives avionics providers an idea of whichsegments to target by pointing out where the greatest share ofgrowth will take place.  According to the report:     Large jet aircraft production "will drive industry growth in1990." Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are expected to deliver 512transport aircraft in the new year.  That is the largest numbershipped since 1968.     Demand for general aviation airplanes and helicopters isexpected to increase in 1990.  Shipments of U.S. general aviationairplanes should pass the $2 billion mark for the first timesince 1981.     U.S. manufacturers will pare down production rates on mostmilitary aircraft programs in 1990.  The U.S. government willtake fewer deliveries from all fighter programs.  On a morepositive note, McDonnell Douglas is slated to deliver its firstC-17 transport aircraft in late 1990.  Also, the government isexpected to make the contract award in 1990 for 211 off-the-shelfbusiness jet aircraft for the Tanker-Transport Trainer System(TTTS).  If the contract is indeed awarded, it will be thelargest single business jet buy in history.     U.S. shipments of missiles, space vehicles, and relatedproducts are forecast to grow more than 3 percent in 1990.Increasing production of U.S. expendable launch vehicles willpace the expansion.     U.S. aerospace trade will rise to a record high in 1990.Projected exports of $33.1 billion and imports of $11.3 billionwill yield a trade surplus of $21.8 billion, up 12 percent fromthe estimated 1989 surplus.U.S. EXPORTS AVIONICS/SIMULATORS 1986/90Dollars in Millions                    1986     1987     1988     1989     1990Avionics            $208     $323     $401     $735     $800Flight Simulators   $126     $107     $159     $180     $180U.S. IMPORTS AVIONICS/SIMULATORS 1986/90Dollars in Millions                   1986     1987     1988      1989     1990Avionics           $306     $308     $310      $210     $280Flight Simulators  $91      $142     $109       NA       NASource: Department of CommerceCautious Optimism Tone For Long-Term Outlook      As is the case the immediate future, the report alsoindicates that civil aerospace programs will be the focus throughthe new decade.

Total sales for 1990 are expected to reach $137.4 billion,representing a 14 percent gain for the industry, AIA said.Profits for 1989, however, declined from $4.9 billion to apreliminary estimate of $4.3 billion.      The civil aircraft sector will be supported by a recordbacklog and increased demand for transport aircraft by theworld's airlines.  That sector's sales will surge from $20.1billion in 1989 to a projected $32 billion this year.  Salesactivity in the military aircraft sector will also rise slightlyin 1990, but will decline in real terms from 1989's figure of $42billion as a result of continued cutbacks in defense spending,AIA said.      Despite the projected growth in sales, AIA pointed out thatspending for military aircraft, a category of aerospace businesswhich has recorded strong growth throughout the 1980s, isprojected to have declined in 1989 by 4 percent after adjustmentfor inflation.  Total sales to the U.S. government, primarily thePentagon, are expected to have risen 4.3 percent in 1989 to $72.2billion.

The trade group estimated defense electronics salesfor 1989 totaled $55 billion.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIONICS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1990SIMULATION/ELECTRONICS SEEN WEATHERING BUDGET STORM      While future defense budgets are expected to fall, somefinancial analysts and industry officials are predicting that thesimulation and electronics industries will be relativelyuntouched by cuts in Pentagon spending and may even grow.      According to Dr. Malcolm Currie, chairman and CEO of HughesAircraft Co., new military tools that are being shaped byemerging technologies will require new levels of training, newskills and new education to be used effectively.  These new high-technology tools offer "tremendous opportunity for a growthindustry" in simulation and training, says Currie.      "Today we face reduced defense budgets, diminishedresources, and reduced force levels.  We have the continuing paceof technology and the complexity of equipment to deal with,"according to Currie.      Wolfgang Demische, a well-respected analyst with UBSSecurities Inc., said if current budgetary trends continue forseveral years "the simulation and training [business] might looksomewhat better" than weapons development.  GM Hughes, Raytheonand Loral are positioned well for these opportunities, Demischesaid in an interview with AVIONICS REPORT.      An "emphasis on upgrading existing platforms" with force-enhancing electronics will become attractive to a fiscallyconservative Pentagon and Congress, and as a result, advancedelectronic and composite material industries are good places toinvest, Byron Callon, an aerospace/defense analyst for PrudentialBache, told AVIONICS REPORT.      Charles Gabriel, senior vice president of the WashingtonResearch Group, affiliated with Credit Lyonnaise, believes theindustry will become "leaner, meaner, more qualitative."      Some analysts, Paine Webber for example, feel defenseelectronics stocks should generally be avoided.      Surveillance, arms control verification, and avionicsupgrades will not be significant growth areas in the future,according to Paine Webber analysts.      The brokerage firm is telling customers who are still hungryfor defense electronics stocks to consider buying in June 1990since Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will be in the UnitedStates and talk of arms control treaties could increase the valueof defense electronics stocks.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIONICS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1990DAB FOR MIDS EXPECTED IN FEBRUARY;OSD TO RECOMMEND MIDSCO      Officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)will recommend that the international consortium, MIDSCO Inc., beawarded a sole-source, firm-fixed-priced, full-scale development(FSD) contract for NATO's Multifunctional InformationDistribution System (MIDS), Pentagon sources tell AVIONICSREPORT.      The recommendation will be made next month at a meeting ofthe Defense Acquisition Board (DAB).  The program is expected tobe worth as much as $5 billion to participating companies overthe next 20 years.      OSD will recommend that MIDSCO get the contract in order toallay European concerns, sources said.  European firms make upthe bulk of the MIDSCO consortium, which is headquartered inDelaware.      A Navy official close to the MIDS program said that theinternational concerns are very important because all thenations' monies are needed to keep the program alive.       The MIDSCO group is composed of Plessey Electronics SystemsCorp. (U.S.), Thomson-CSF (France), Siemens (Germany), Italtel(Italy) and Inisel (Spain).  The Navy official said the U.S. iscontributing about 40 percent of the funds for the program andthe Europeans are putting up the balance.      But others said since there are no "purely owned" U.S.companies in the MIDSCO group, it will be difficult for theconsortium to get the contract.  Plessey U.S. is part of theBritish-based firm which was recently bought out by GEC ofBritain and Germany's Siemens (AR, Sept. 22, 1989, p. 1).Hughes Wants Role      Officials at Hughes Aircraft Co. are irritated by reportsthat MIDSCO will get the MIDS development contract.  The firmfired off a letter last August saying it had not been given afair chance to participate in the FSD phase of the MIDS programand requested that the Defense Department reconsider OSD'sposition on the FSD contract award.  Hughes officials tellAVIONICS REPORT that if MIDSCO is awarded the contract, the U.S.will be sending its money overseas.  A Hughes official also saidthat his firm's substantial effort on the Joint TacticalInformation Distribution System (JTIDS), which MIDS will be basedon, qualifies it for consideration for the FSD award.      A Pentagon source said that in a reply letter to Hughes, OSDsaid "We will take your (Hughes') concerns through theacquisition process and keep you advised along the way."  Headded that while MIDSCO will be recommended for the FSD contract,there is no guarantee that the DAB will agree and said that theprocess is "rigorous and very democratic."      A Pentagon official made it clear that the full-scaleproduction phase of the MIDS program will be competitive.Joint Venture Possible      Indeed, he mentioned it is possible that some sort of jointventure for MIDS may be decided on at the DAB.  An Air Forcesource confirmed that a lot of talk about a joint venture hadoccurred.  Others noted a joint venture would force the Pentagonto change some of the original ground rules in the MIDS programwhich basically called for MIDS to go sole-source to MIDSCO.      However, an Air Force source pointed out that the idea of ajoint venture has not "really been thought about in theinternational environment" and added that "everything has beennegotiated to date within the current MIDSCO structure."      The Air Force source also disclosed that since it is aninternational program, MIDS was originally going to bypass theconventional U.S. acquisition process.  But John Betti, undersecretary of defense/acquisition, said last August that hisoffice should have some input into the MIDS program.  TheFebruary DAB meeting is an outgrowth of Betti's request, an AirForce source said.MOU/RFP Being Readied      Describing the current status of the program, a Pentagonsource told us that Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) for FSDbetween the participating nations are being finalized and that aRequest for Proposal (RFP) is nearing completion by severalworking groups in the MIDS program.  He said a letter of intentis ready for the various nations to review that, if approved,would allow the release of the RFP after the DAB meeting nextmonth.      If the DAB decides to proceed with a joint venture for MIDSFSD, meaning Hughes participation in addition to MIDSCO forexample, then the program could be delayed by one and a half totwo years because the acquisition process would have to beredone, sources said.  RFPs would have to be rewritten and sentout to industry for comment and bids would have to be obtainedagain and  government/industry negotiations would have to startall over, sources said.      According to Pentagon sources, the Navy will have the leadfor the U.S. in the program and the Air Force will play asupporting role.  The Navy F/A-18 jet-fighter will be the U.S.platform that first uses the MIDS terminal.  A Navy source closeto the program confirmed that this is what OSD has been sayingverbally, but added that OSD's "grammar has been nebulous" andnot totally reassuring.      Industry sources said the Air Force wanted the lead on MIDSand had called for the FSD to be competitive.  A Pentagonofficial acknowledged that the Air Force did want the lead on theprogram but that for budgetary reasons and because it did notelect the F-16 as a MIDS platform, the Navy was given the lead.      An Air Force source said he was unaware that a finaldecision had been made to give the Navy the lead.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIONICS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1990SAR REPORT UNDERSTATES NAVSTAR GPS PROCUREMENT COSTS      A General Accounting Office (GAO) report states that aSelective Acquisition Report (SAR) for the Navstar GlobalPositioning System (GPS) understates Navy and Marine Corpsrequirements by 4,000 units and subsequent procurement costs by$200 to $400 million.      Initial SAR estimates in December 1988 said the Air Forcetotal program cost for user equipment would be $4.1 billion(escalated dollars) for about 25,500 sets.      The GAO report also states that delays in operationaltesting of low-rate production sets will result in a 15-monthpostponement of a full-rate production decision, from March 1989to June 1990. Operational testing of low-rate production setsshould have been completed in the third and fourth quarters of FY'90.      The Navstar GPS is a "space-based radio navigation systemdesigned to provide precise, continuous, all-weather, commongeographical coordinate system, world positioning navigationdata, together with time and velocity information, for amultiplicity of military and civil users," according to thereport. The Air Force, Army and Navy joint program has been inlow-rate initial production since June 1986.      Only 5 percent of all military platforms able to carry thesystem will be tested. The report says, "Air Force officialsstated that while the number of test platforms is limited,additional data from other operational tests for othermodifications involving GPS user equipment will be used and thecombined testing data will cover 90 percent of the interfacesbetween GPS user equipment and other navigational and weaponsystems." The platforms to be used are: F-16 fighter; the SH-60antisubmarine warfare helicopter; LST-1179 tank landing ship;FFG-7 fast frigate; CG-26 guided missile cruiser; SSN-637 nuclearpowered submarine; SWCL light special warfare craft; the UH-60Manpack troop transport helicopter; and the HMMWV (High MobilityMulti-purpose Wheeled Vehicle).      A fully operational GPS consists of a space segment with 21satellites and three orbiting spares, "in six orbital planesabout 10,900 nautical miles above the earth." A ground controlsegment with a master control station, three ground antenna andfive monitoring stations around the world to control thespacecraft are also included. In addition it will contain a userequipment segment with four types of radio receivers to convertsatellite signals into navigation, time and position information.      The four types of receivers are: five channel sets for highperformance aircraft; five channel sets for ships and submarines;two channel sets for medium performance aircraft, likehelicopters; and the Manpack/Vehicular set for hand-held andvehicle applications. The space segment is in full-rateproduction and the control system has been installed and preparedfor Space Command turnover.

Analysis and interim report preparation will takeup to 90 days, and final reporting for a full-rate productiondecision will take another 60 days. Program officials expect thefinal test report to be submitted on April 15, 1990."      The DoD requires a complete report 45 days prior to aDefense Acquisition Board meeting.

Some of E-O's major projects include the ATARS IRlinescanner and the AAR-47 missile warning system.  Loral saidthe acquisition will boost its position in all-weather, high-resolution, day-night imaging for reconnaissance and missileguidance across a spectrum of sensor technologies.

Top marketing executives from all three enginemakers tell AP that asthey look ahead this year, it's clear that 1995's optimism wasn'tmisplaced. A few carriers are poised to make major decisions on bigturbofans for large aircraft this month, and many other key competitionsinvolving GE's GE90 and CF6, P&W's PW4000 Series and Rolls-Royce's Trentand RB211-535 will probably be decided early in the year.   In some cases, numbers are still being worked out. But right now enginemarketeers are fighting hard to power aircraft for Air India, InternationalLease Finance Corp., Delta, Air China, China Airlines, South AfricanAirways, Malaysian Air System and Philippine Air Lines. In addition, whilenot officially in the market for new aircraft, insiders say AmericanAirlines, Northwest Airlines, TWA and Continental are all hot prospects for1996.any day now   Marketing executives describe many of the deals as being at the "any-day-now" stage, among them Air India, which may buy 10 firm plus 13 optionBoeing 777s or McDonnell Douglas MD-11 trijets, and South African Airways,looking at ways to power six firm and 10 option 777s. Malaysian Air System,expected this week to announce plans to buy as many as 25 long-range Boeingjetliners, 777s and 747-400s, is also close to choosing engines and mayunveil its engine decision along with its aircraft decision.   International Lease Finance Corp., which is reportedly looking at arounda "dozen" Airbus A330 widebody twins, along with perhaps 18 to 20 777s, isseen by many as making up its mind before the end of January. Airbus, onthe losing end of 1995's market share battle after a triumphant 1994, waspushing hard for a decision before the end of December, but ILFC chiefSteven Hazy has reportedly signaled that mid- to late-January is a morelikely date.   "The other one right behind it is Delta," which wants to start phasingout its elderly Lockheed L-1011 trijets, says one of Rolls-Royce'smarketing chiefs. The first few retirements will probably be replaced byexercising existing options on Boeing 757s. But sometime this quarter thecarrier is expected to declare the competition open, at which time "theywill be looking at a longer-term replacement for the Tri-Star," he says.That evaluation could take some time, running into 1996's fourth quarter.   A few 1996 contests are active without actually being declared, amongthem American Airlines and Delta.   "Don't expect a selection" at American in 1996, "but a lot ofposturing," says a GE executive. "American has stated their desire for777s, and that will probably be considered by the aircraft and enginemakersas a campaign."   Still, tight-fisted American Chairman Bob Crandall has also made itclear that he won't buy an airplane - ever - unless he can make it costless than anything he's already operating, which at least one marketeerthinks may be too tall an order. "Crandall's party line is no newairplanes," a Rolls executive adds, although "we continue to update themevery couple of months on the progress of the Trent, and we visit themregularly in hopes that we are positioning the Trent" as a crediblecandidate whenever an evaluation finally gets underway.   Northwest, already on the list to start receiving Airbus A330 twins, isreportedly quietly in the market for 777 twins this year, and Boeing thinksthere's a niche for a few 777s at that airline. All three enginemakers areexpected to make the trek to Eagan, Minn., within three to four weeks toshow off GE90s, PW4084s and Trent 800s.   Egyptair has been in the best-and-final offer stage for engines to powerits three Boeing 777s for months, and at least two of the enginemakers saythey've "won" the competition three times. With spares, and the relativelyhigh margins produced by small, non-launch customers, Egyptair could beworth about $800 million to the winning enginemaker within the next fewweeks.   Like Delta, TWA hopes to start replacing L-1011 Tri-Stars, but engineindustry executives expect the carrier to use the decision this year as anopportunity to get smaller, cashing in the airplanes in favor of a mix ofBoeing 767 widebodies and 757 narrowbodies. America West and Continentalare also in the market for additional Boeing 757s, a market where Pratt &Whitney's PW2000 competes with Rolls' RB211-535.'controlled growth'   "When you look at what the environment is, traffic and revenues arefairly strong, and...airlines are starting to see some of the results" ofprevious years' cost-cutting, says a Rolls executive. As a result, airlinesnow feel better about returning to a buying mode, but executives agree thatyou won't see a return to the buying frenzy of the mid-1980s.   "If there's one word that summarizes it, it's controlled growth," hesays. "There's still some caution at the airlines about adding newaircraft, and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that there's aheavy debt load out there. Let's face it, towards the end of the '90s therecould be another cycle downturn, plus you've got a lot of pilot issues outthere."   In addition, some of the euphoria will begin to wear off as marketingefforts shift from the Far East - where new aircraft, especially widebodytwins, have been selling like crazy to newly cash-rich airlines - to Europeand North America, where carriers are healthy again, but chastened.   That may mean a cooling off period from 1995's new order growth rate,which outpaced 1994's nearly four times over. But cool doesn't mean cold,and the enginemakers remain optimistic about prospects in North America andEurope.   "On big twins, very few people in Europe and North America made a move"in recent years, remarks one P&W executive. "The wave of big twins sweepingthrough Asia is already decided...and the next wave has probably got to gothrough Europe and North America.   "The big twin market race is not over," he declares, and the 777 "is notjust an Asian airplane. Boeing has hit a home-run with this airplane."Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.BOEING RATE HIKES SIGNAL JETLINER RECOVERYFaster Ramp-Up For 777; Previous Cut-Back Plans Reversed   Enginemakers looking for hard evidence of recovery need look no furtherthan Seattle: Boeing is boosting jetliner production rates for the firsttime in three years, and should reach 24 aircraft per month by early 1997as 777 production rises faster than originally planned.   Apart from the 757 long-range narrowbody, Boeing reports rates will riseacross the board - 737 and 777 come in for the biggest hike - andmanagement is putting off a planned 757 decrease for three months. By thefourth quarter of 1996 Boeing should be building 22.5 aircraft per month,rising to 24 when the 777, which entered service last spring, reaches fullspeed.   The rate hike is partly to catch up after a two-month Machinists'strike. But it also reflects a fundamental recovery in the jetlinermarketplace, and it led the company to sound its most optimistic tone aboutproduction since the 1990s began.   "This is a positive sign to see the beginning of an upswing inproduction rates," says Boeing Commercial Airplane Group President RonWoodard. "It reflects the turnaround that our customers are experiencingand underscores the positive long-term outlook for our industry."   Rates on the 737, originally expected to slip from today's seven permonth to five next April, will instead rise to 8.5 per month by the fourthquarter of 1996. Production of 747s will rise from two per month to 3.5 inthe fourth quarter, while 757 production will hold at four aircraft permonth until September, 1996, when the rate goes to three. At the same time,767 production will rise by half an airplane, to four per month.   Boeing is also ramping up 777 widebody twin rates faster than originallyprojected. The company was going to build three 777s each month throughout1996 and then boost the rate to four per month in 1997. But yesterdayBoeing said it would build 3.5 777s each month by the third quarter of1996, and will build five per month in early 1997.   Even with two quarters of recovery under its belt this year, Boeingoriginally planned to cut production back. Through the first half of 1995the company booked 25% more orders than it had through all of 1994, but thenew orders wouldn't have started paying off until 1997 or later, and Boeingwas supposed to remain stuck at 17.5 planes per month until at least 1997.   Management now thinks rates should recover to 20 aircraft per monthduring the first quarter of 1996. Boeing describes this as "pre-strikelevels," suggesting that non-strike rates never actually hit the 17.5-planenadir originally forecast, although during the strike the company barelymanaged to push out a dozen planes a month.   "Boeing...continues to work with customers on the specific deliverytiming following the strike," the company says in a prepared statementdetailing the new production rates, and expects to project total 1996deliveries before the end of January.   Peak deliveries came in 1992, when Boeing built 441 aircraft at a rateof better than 36 planes a month.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.GE90 MAY NEED MORE TESTS TO WIN EARLY ETOPSTeething Problems, FAA Discomfort Combine To Move The Goalposts   Officials on the FAA's Reliability Assessment Board - the body thatgives thumbs-up or down to enginemakers' requests for ETOPS clearance -will probably give General Electric the go-ahead this month to begin itscrucial 1,000-cycle flight test series on the GE90, but early extended twinoperations clearance probably won't be granted without additional groundtest runs, sources tell AP.   It's widely believed that board members and U.S. airworthinessauthorities remain uncomfortable with the concept of early long-range twinclearance, particularly in the face of pressure from even more skepticalEuropean counterparts. One source says that at least four out of sevenboard members, when asked to produce a draft of their decision on GE90 inOctober, came down against early ETOPS.   And a surge during an acceptance flight last month for a GE90-poweredBritish Airways 777 - embarrassingly, less than a week before GE was due toappear before the board to prove the GE90 was reliable enough to go on tothe next phase of testing - didn't help. That surge held up deliveries ofBA's second and third airplanes, although FAA late last month okayed aproposal to modify fan tip clearances just on BA's GE90s as an interimsolution to expedite deliveries.clearance modification   A GE spokesman tells AP this week that British Airways now has itssecond aircraft, and the third should be delivered before the middle ofthis month. Aircraft already in service will get the clearance modificationsometime in mid-January "as a precaution," he says.   But are all these troubles enough to scupper early ETOPS? Probably not,airworthiness authorities in the U.S. and Europe privately concede. At thesame time, however, regulators point out that the GE90 design has beentweaked several times over the past half year, and another set of groundruns is "probably not a bad idea," says one U.S. official.   If the word from the board is to go for more tests, the answer needs tocome soon - the 1,000 cycle ETOPS test will take about four months to run,a period of time during which additional ground runs could be done withoutjeopardizing delivery dates or promises on winning the extended- rangeclearance. After that, some delay would be inevitable, and that could costGE millions of dollars.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.THIOKOL, CARLYLE CLOSE ON HOWMET FOR $750 MILLIONRocket-maker Could Own Howmet Outright By 1999   Rocket-maker Thiokol and aerospace-heavy merchant bank The Carlyle Groupclosed last month on their joint purchase of gas turbine components andrepair giant Howmet Corp. for $750 million.

Two of UTC's aerospace units - Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney - have beenthe subject of merger and sell-off rumors, and early last year, Davidwouldn't rule out putting Sikorsky up for sale. In August, the Londonfinancial markets started their annual rumor of a merger between P&W andrival Rolls-Royce.   But selling is now out of the picture, and David says "it might even benice if we could make an acquisition, or two, or three," with the caveatthat any acquisition be a ready fit for UTC with no pruning.   After a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, David tells APthat he would consider acquisitions in either the engine or helicoptermarket, and that so far the only obstacle has been a lack of candidates.   He hints that one reason UTC is interested in buying on the propulsionside is to boost Pratt & Whitney in its "neck-and-neck" competition withGeneral Electric.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.INT'L JET ENGINE SUPPLY TO ACQUIRE STARTUP CARRIERMerger With Air 21 Up For Shareholder Approval   International Jet Engine Supply agreed to merge with startup carrier Air21, effectively acquiring the Fresno, Calif.-based regional airline if thecarrier's shareholders okay the deal in a special meeting slated forFriday.

The new contract also answers industry speculation that with theintroduction of the new G-V business jet - powered by BMW Rolls-Royce'sBR710 turbofan - the G-IV and G-IV SP might begin to wind down.   "Today's announcement reconfirms Gulfstream's plan to build the G-IV SPand G-V concurrently," Rolls says in a prepared statement. The 13,850 lbst.Tay 611 already powers 280 G-IV and G-IV SP business jets.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.RUSSIAN COURT TAKES UP RYBINSK CHALLENGES NEXT WEEKFuture For GE's 'Strategic Partner' Should Resolve   The two-year battle over whether and how to privatize Russia's once-proud Rybinsk Motors - General Electric's strategic partner in the formerSoviet Union - looks set to end next week, when a Russian high court willtake up a lawsuit challenging the state's authority to put up stakes in thecompany for public sale.   The State Property Committee's Federal Bankruptcy Agency had hoped toput 37% of the aircraft enginemaker on the block last week, but wound upputting off the auction until mid-February because of another lawsuitclaiming that part of that stake had already been set aside for workers.   But the second lawsuit, by AO Rybinskiye Motory itself against thestate, claims that the whole privatization is improper, a suit that will beheard Jan. 15 by a Moscow high court.   "I venture to suppose that the court will not decide this case in favorof Rybinsk Motors," says Georgy Tal, the bankruptcy agency's first deputychief executive. "And after that the decision of the lower court will bemeaningless."   That would clear the way for the auction to proceed, and for Rybinsk tosettle down to the business of recovery.   Rybinsk makes engines for almost all Russia's military transports andmore than half of its civil aircraft, including the Ilyushin Il-76,Ilyushin Il-62 and Tupolev Tu-154M, but output tumbled to six engines permonth in 1995 after averaging nearly 10 a month in 1994.   Last fall GE worked out framework agreements with Rybinsk covering anyGE engine with potential Russian applications, and the goal - now delayed -was to have solid agreements worked out by the end of 1995 covering atleast three engines in five applications: the CT7 turboprop on the SukhoiSu-80 and Kamov Ka-64, CFM International medium turbofans for re-enginingprojects, and industrial turbine installations.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.GENERAL ELECTRIC   GENERAL ELECTRIC may wind up being rival Pratt & Whitney's biggestcheerleader, at least for now. That's because as the first early ETOPSengine in commercial service, the PW4084 is under the microscope as thevalidation - or repudiation - of the whole idea of winning extended twinoperations clearance from entry into service. GE may not like P&W, butuntil the GE90 gets its own early ETOPS approval, GE needs to ensure thatthe concept gets all the support it needs.   "They better pray nothing happens to [the P&W] engine," quips an FAAofficial, noting that GE may not hear definitively about early ETOPS untilmid-1996.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.IS IT GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS?   IS IT GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS? Airbus Industrie delivered 106 aircraftthrough November, a lot more than it booked in new orders. Some financialanalysts like to see that - it means inventory is being converted into cashas the backlog slims down. But it also means that future deliveries, andthus future cash flow, will be curtailed, and that could pose interestingproblems for aircraft enginemakers looking to new Airbus products formarket expansion.   One industry veteran tells AP that the money problem couldn't come at aworse time for the European consortium. "They have to solve" the problem ofthe A330 and A340, he says, noting that if Boeing keeps its market leadwith the 777, a re-engining isn't enough to keep up with the 777's rangeand payload. "The A330/A340 wing is maxed-out," he says. Regardless ofengine, "you won't go any faster, any farther."Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.IRAN MAY BE CLOSE   IRAN MAY BE CLOSE to a deal to open an aircraft plant to build Russianjetliners, some 17 years after the Islamic revolution closed the door toflag carrier Iran Air renewing its fleet of Boeing-built jetliners.Published reports in Iran claim that the Isphahan plant in central Iranwill start building Tu-114 transports within a year, and other planes arereportedly also under study.

Japan's governmentagreed last week on a new five-year defense plan that scuttled the futurefighter program - slated to produce a demonstrator aircraft by the turn ofthe century (AP, Sept. 29, 1994) - in favor of continuing work on theprogram's 10,000 lbst.-class turbofan. Japan's Defense Agency hopes to useIshikawajima-Harima's 3,674 lbst. F3-30 turbofan, which now powers theKawasaki T-4 trainer, as the starting point for the new machine.   JDA also cut back on its FS-X procurement, dropping 11 of the 141originally planned U.S./Japan co-developed fighters under pressure from theFinance Ministry.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.ORDERBOOK AT A GLANCE -- COMMERCIALIllustration(s):Illustration: Graph: OrderBook At A Glance -- CommercialCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAEROSPACE PROPULSION via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   Vol. 7, No.AEROSPACE PROPULSION ORDERBOOK -- COMMERCIAL   This update includes late 1995 orders, but final 1995 delivery figureswon't be available for several weeks.

CopyrightAIR CARGO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996BLIZZARD OF '96 WREAKS HAVOC; WILL COST INDUSTRY MILLIONS      The blizzard on the East Coast brought most air freightoperations to a standstill for parts of last week. Airport closuresfrom North Carolina to Maine had a ripple effect on air travelthroughout the country, forcing countless cancellations and delays.       United Parcel Service, which operates regional sort hubs inNewark and Philadelphia, trucked all air packages to open airportsand diverted flights to its Louisville, Ky. headquarters, says UPSspokesperson Ken Sternad. "We had a lot of contingency plans tokeep things moving and made alternative arrangements where customerscould pick up packages at our facilities or had drivers walking insome areas."       The storm is going to cost UPS millions of dollars, mostly inadded operational costs such as overtime, rerouting of flights andusing a less efficient distribution system, he says.        "[Jan. 8] will go down as a day of infamy," says FedExspokesperson Bill Carroll. "Our whole East Coast operation prettymuch came to a stop because all major airports were closed. We havedealt with a lot of ice, hurricanes and earthquakes, but we havenever been hit this hard in such a large area. Usually disastersare confined to a fairly small geographic area and don't have sucha far reaching impact," he says.      Airborne Express couriers made deliveries on foot in New YorkCity early last week, but did not face the pickup and deliveryobstacles of FedEx and UPS because the company focuses on primarilybusiness accounts, says Airborne spokesperson Scott Hopper. "Thedowntown business areas were cleared first so we were able to reachcustomers," he says. "We had planes on the ground on the West Coastand other warmer cities, but by Wednesday we were making about 60%of our deliveries."       DHL sent its drivers out to make deliveries in New York Cityvia the subway on Jan. 9 until the driving restrictions werelifted, says DHL spokesperson David Fonkalsrud.       TNT Express Worldwide rerouted all international shipmentsfrom JFK International Airport to Miami International until JFKservices resumed on Jan. 10.      "We faced the obvious problems of finding lift to the FarEast due to flight cancellations," says Michael Tomasulo, AirExpress International director of airline gateways, North America."Our commercial customers understand what we were up against andcarriers were very good about honoring our lift allocations." AEIwas still struggling with backlog from a very heavy December whenthe storm hit, but says operations were back to normal by themiddle of last week.   Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR CARGO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996FAA RETRACTS FREIGHTER CONVERSION KIT CERTIFICATION, ISSUES AD       The Federal Aviation Administration retracted a previouslyapproved modification kit which converts a passenger Boeing 747 aircraftinto a freighter. The airworthiness directive, issued Jan. 3, impacts 10Boeing 747-100s and -200s operated by four carriers, all converted bySan Francisco-based GATX Airlog. The AD, citing defective main deckfloors and inadequately constructed doors, requires the carriers tomodify the aircraft to meet the revised FAA standards by Jan. 30 or beforced to halve the payload now carried by the aircraft. The fourairlines affected by the AD -- Evergreen Airlines, Tower Air, AmericanInternational Airways and Polar Air -- all have plans to modify theaircraft to meet the revised standards before the end of the month andhave the aircraft back in service carrying full payloads of cargo. Thenew weight limitations would reduce the 747's payload from 220,000 pounds to 120,000 pounds, making the aircraft nearlyimpossible to operate economically.      The issue of the 747 cargo door is not new. GATX and theairlines have been engaged in dialogue  with the FAA for more thana year.     "This has taken on a life bigger than most ADs, even more thanthose of a more serious nature," says Rick Hatton, president ofGATX Airlog. "The need to make some corrections along the way islike any other AD. The fact the FAA continues to hammer the safetypoints is unfounded, but it's their prerogative and has nothing todo with structure," he adds. "In fact, the incidents all validatethe strength of the structure."     "Our analysis failed to show that all of the points around thedoor meet 150% of the required FAA standard. We don't think it's asafety-related issue, but it was easier to fix it than to fightit."     GATX Airlog, whose only business is modifying 747s tofreighters, received FAA approval to begin modifications in 1988.The firm is finishing its 23rd of the type this month.     GATX is supplying the four carriers with the materials to makethe modifications and procedures for the aircraft. Once all aircraftmodifications are complete, Hatton says, the FAA will most likelyterminate the AD before it takes effect.     American International Airways expects its two 747-100s to bedown for about 10 days to undergo the modification beginning Jan.10, says Bill Gray, AIA vice president and general manager. "Forus, the first quarter is always slower so this is the time to dothe modification," he says. Gray qualified the modification as "thecost of doing business," adding he expects the modifications to costbetween $150,000 and $200,000, not including loss of business.     Tower Air anticipates the modification to take four days and itis scheduled to be completed by its own maintenance staff by theend of the month.      Polar Air is making the changes during its routine maintenancewhich had already been scheduled for this month for the twoaffected aircraft, says Polar Air spokesperson Catherine West. Theairline plans for both aircraft to be fixed and approved by the endof January. "Although, there is any real proof of the problems,there is enough of a risk that the carriers want to take care ofit," she adds.    Calls to Evergreen were not returned at press time. Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR CARGO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996CORRECTION:     Fritz Companies received ISO 9002 certification in 10 UKoffices, not ISO 9001 as reported on Dec. 7.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR CARGO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996FOUR INFLIGHT INCIDENTS ON RECORD     Operators of the 10 affected aircraft have reported fourinflight incidents that have resulted in substantial structuraldamage. GATX and the carriers maintain that the incidents havenothing to do with the way the aircraft was modified. The incidentreports include: a 3.0g dive maneuver, which was successfullyrecovered by the pilot; a total engine separation due to departureinto known turbulence; an uncontained engine failure which resultedin wing and fuselage damage; and a severe landing that resulted ina 40-foot by 3-foot hole in the fuselage.     The FAA is accepting responsibility for the matter, saying itissued the certification in error and has since streamlined itscertification process for cargo equipment, moving the process to itsNorthwest regional office.     The FAA found that a payload reduction was the only way to makethe aircraft safe under adverse conditions. It intends toinvestigate other types of loading conditions to determine whetheradditional operational limitations must be imposed to address thestructural inadequacies of the main deck floor and other areas thathave not yet been identified. Although the action is a final rule,comments are invited. The deadline is March 4.    Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR CARGO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996FEDEX INDIA PLANS AIR SERVICE, AWARDS CONTRACT FOR CARGO CONVERSIONS    Blue Dart Express, FedEx's exclusive agent in India, is gettinginto the airline business. Already the largest air express companyin India, Blue Dart will be the first carrier to operate jetfreighters in the country. The firm bought two Boeing 737-200s fromAir India for $4 million, which are now being converted intofreighters by Georgia-based Stambaugh Aviation. Air services areslated to begin in March.      Bombay-based Blue Dart, with revenues of $27.7 million in 1995and expected revenues of more than $40 million this year, was thefirst company to be given permission from the Indian government tooperate air cargo services in the country. To date, the company hasacted as FedEx's India agent as well as a domestic courier.        "It has always been Blue Dart's vision to set up a domesticexpress aviation service with its own fleet of aircraft but thiscould only be done when the Indian government deregulated theaviation industry about three years ago," Diwaker Singh, senior vicepresident, marketing and commercial tells ACR. With sites set onproviding a total transportation and logistical solutions forcompanies such as GE, Motorola, IBM, Ford and Sony which havefactories in the country, Singh is confident that Blue Dart "willrevolutionize the way that distribution is currently done in thecountry."     The 737 will carry eight pallets of cargo once the conversion iscomplete. Singh is initially targeting door-to-door express cargowith heavy cargo treated as filler. The long-term objective is veryclear, he says. Blue Dart is positioning itself to be "anintegrated express door-to-door package mover." Blue Dart alreadyholds a 26% market share in India and Singh only sees that figurerising. Once air services begin, he predicts revenues increasing byabout 100% by 1997.     "The fact that they are adding air service will certainlyimprove our domestic network," says FedEx spokesperson Cliff Morley."But FedEx service levels will remain the same, unless, of course,they improve their transit times."     Competition in cargo is fierce, but thanks to the sheer size ofthe country and often undependable service, Singh sees the chance toenter the fray as a "great opportunity." To date, the only domesticair competition Blue Dart faces is from United Parcel Serviceaffiliate, Elbee Lmt., which currently operates four Fokker F27turboprops. Singh expects to add a third 737 in about six monthsand possibly more, depending on market demand.

Following a year-long study, Airbornechose the 767 over both the Airbus A300B4 and the McDonnell DouglasDC-10-10.    Nine of the 12 will be acquired from Itochu Air Lease Corp.,with the remaining three from Marubeni Corp. Airborne lists thepurchase price, plus spares and major modification to cargoconfiguration, at $290 million.    Airborne is completing the conversion at its airline hubfacility in Wilmington, Ohio. Airborne, which does not create a sideloading door but loads with special containers through the passengerdoor, is able to save a significant amount of money on theconversions. The first conversion is expected to begin in April andenter the fleet about seven months later.      The 767s will be a net gain of 12 aircraft for Airborne. Thecarrier, on some its heavier routes, plans to replace DC-8s withthe 767s where upgrades are merited. The DC-8s will move to newroutes or a second aircraft will be added where certain city pairsneed two flights.       Airborne also plans to acquire 10 to 15 more 767-200s in thenext eight years at a total cost of $310 million. The first two767s will arrive in 1997, followed by four in '98, four in '99 andtwo in 2000. The move "should decrease operating costs while keeping capitalrequirements relatively unchanged," the airline says.    The 767 has many operating advantages over other aircraft of thesame size, mostly due to newer, fuel-efficient engines and a two-person crew. Airborne figures its 767s will have a 14% lower directoperating cost per hour than the DC-8, 17% less than the A300 and43% less than the DC-10-10.    Several factors in Airborne's decision were to acquire aircraftthat could serve markets that it is outgrowing with DC-8s, as wellas the ability to fly unrestricted transcontinental payloads at autilization rate of at least 12 hours a day.     The cargo airline also incorporated environmental factors in itsdecision, telling ACR that the 767 has the lowest nitrous oxideemissions of any candidate aircraft, 17% lower than the A300B4 and48% less than the DC-10-10.    Airborne now operates a fleet of 63 DC-9s, 35 DC-8s and 11 YS-11s. The carrier says it has no plans to retire any aircraft as aresult of the purchase decision, and has been adding eight to 10DC-9s and DC-8s annually and plans to continue that rate.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR CARGO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996FAA, AIRLINES BEGIN TESTING BOMB-RESISTANT CARGO CONTAINERS    Some of the nations's largest airlines will participate in anFAA program to test baggage and cargo containers that can withstandan explosion like the one that downed Pan Am Flight 103 overLockerbie, Scotland in 1988.    The program, scheduled to begin in June and run through 1997,will collect cost and performance data so that the FAA candetermine whether to mandate use of the containers, says Ken Hacker,the agency's aircraft hardening program manager. The $5 millionprogram will demonstrate the cost to airlines of maintaining thehardened containers and how well their blast-resistant propertieshold up under repeated use on flights.     Unlike current containers, which can still be used afterincurring minor damage from routine handling, hardened containerswill have stricter standards. The operational testing will help theFAA answer questions from the U.S. Congress about the cost-benefittradeoff between explosives detection and aircraft hardening, Hackersays. Increased blast resistance within an aircraft reduces the needto detect smaller and smaller amounts of explosives. Researchsponsored by the FAA Technical Center has shown that it is feasibleto contain an explosion within a cargo container.     The FAA is considering requiring hardened cargo containers tohold mail or electronic equipment, or for aircraft that fly inareas in which a security threat exists. Hardened containers protectan aircraft's fuselage by absorbing some of the pressure of anexplosion and venting the rest into the cargo compartment oradjacent containers at a manageable rate. They also weigh more.    While airlines are interested in enhancing safety, they areconcerned about the cost and extra weight of hardened containers,says Trans World Airlines spokesman John McDonald.    But research is being done to develop a hardened containerweighing 250 pounds, says the FAA's Hacker. Aluminum containers nowin use weigh 150 to 250 pounds. Mass-produced hardened containersare expected to cost $3,000 or more. Aluminum containers cost $1,500to $2,000.    Another concern of airlines is the limited applicability ofhardened containers. The prototype containers, which conform to LD-3cargo container standards, are only used on widebody aircraft. Cargomoving on narrowbody aircraft is usually not containerized. AmericanAirlines Cargo  spokesman Ed Martelle pointed out that 68% of hiscarrier's fleet are narrowbody aircraft and could not use thehardened containers.He also worries about terrorists' response tothe use of hardened containers. They likely would turn their effortsaway from international flights, which are served by widebodyaircraft, and target the U.S. and European markets, which are morelikely to be served by narrowbody aircraft, he says.    The FAA next month will choose several companies to supply 10 to20 containers for the tests. American Airlines, TWA and Delta AirLines will be among the first airlines to use the containers onscheduled passenger flights in May or June.     The prototype containers, which conform to LD-3 cargo containerstandards, will be placed on Boeing and McDonnell Douglas widebodyaircraft. Cargo carriers will also be included in the program tosee how different operating conditions affect the containers'performance.    Based on the feedback it receives from the participatingairlines, the FAA will ask vendors to modify the containers and mayalso select additional manufacturers later this year.

Although the cargo facilities are larger -- with a net gain of22,000 square feet of space and better equipped -- it is locatedthree and a half miles from the main terminal making last minuteadditions a near impossibility. The one-way tug ride from SouthService Center to the terminal takes a minimum of 20 minutes.Operational costs have more than tripled at the new airport, butDick Martino, United's manager for cargo services, maintains it isstill a profitable station.     The Denver operation is the fourth largest in United's domesticsystem in terms of volume. It is also the most technologicallyadvanced. Yet growth opportunities look dim for heavy freight. "Weare really struggling with a diminishing manufacturing base becausemost area companies are paper-based," Martino says.     Calling trucks his most fervent competitor, Martino says theairlines and truckers go head-to-head for shipments destined withina 500 mile radius of the airport. "Truckers have really learned todo business," Martino says. "On the rate side they have always beenthere, but they are becoming much smarter and better automated."     Still, air cargo in Denver managed 16% growth in 1995.Agricultural products are a mainstay for the Denver operation,namely beef from Nebraska, Iowa and Colorado headed for the FarEast. United's Small Package Dispatch (SPD) also is gaining ground.SPD pieces travel in the baggage mode, can not exceed 70 pounds andreceive same-day service. Denver posted a record month for SPD inOctober with more than 1 million pounds shipped. An average monthis closer to between 300,000 and 500,000 pounds.     The U.S. mail is also big business for United's Denver Cargooperation. United carries 70% of the U.S. mail in Denver and is theonly carrier with a direct link to the U.S. Postal Servicefacility.     Denver is really a trucking market for United, Martino says. Andit is forced to be because 80% of the aircraft United flies intothe market are narrowbodies typically filled with passengers,baggage and ski equipment in the winter months, not leaving muchroom for cargo. In the summer, Denver is plagued by thin air andhigh temperatures, which proves to be an impossible combination forfreight because the aircraft is invariably weight restricted. Twentyof the 270 daily United flights from Denver are served withwidebodies. United's largest port at Chicago O'Hare Internationalhas the same fleet mix, Martino says, because the widebodies arerelegated to the coasts for international flights.

Within a 300-mile radius of its home base at Luxembourg airport are someof the biggest players in the air freight business: scheduled carriersLufthansa, Air France, KLM and British Airways which have made cargo a coreoperation. Federal Express, UPS and DHL planes also are flying into airportsless than a day's truck drive away, underlining the new challengers in thebattle for European cargo.     Heiner Wilkens, president and chief executive officer of Cargolux,meanwhile, insists the company is nimble enough to survive. The headlinefigures show Cargolux is more than keeping pace with the competition. Lastyear, it moved up three places to 17th in the world air freight rankings, andto No.5 in Europe pushing ahead of both Swissair and Alitalia.     Cargolux's bottom line also is looking a lot healthier after the savagerecession of 1992-93. A $4.88 million operating loss in 1993 was transformedinto a $10.7 million profit in 1994 as revenues surged to $307 million from$241 million and traffic was up 39 percent at a record 182,000 tons.     The surge continued in 1995 with an operating profit of between $16million and $17 million.     Mr. Wilkens arrived in May 1995 when Cargolux was on a roll, celebratingits 25th year in business. In September it took delivery of its third Boeing747-400 freighter -- a fourth is due in 1998 -- and was involved in thenegotiations for an "open skies" pact between Luxembourg and the UnitedStates. And the market is booming, noted Mr. Wilkens, with a load factor inexcess of 90 percent.     But he doesn't minimize the size of the task facing Cargolux. "Tomaintain our existing market share we must grow every three years by anamount equivalent to the capacity of one 747 freighter."     This search for cargo is taking place in a fast changing environment.Carriers like KLM say there will be at most three of four dedicated scheduledcargo airlines by the turn of the century. Lufthansa and KLM are gettingcloser to their big corporate customers to provide door-to-door transport andlogistics services, inevitably bypassing freight forwarders. Meanwhile, theintegrators are moving increasingly into markets that were once the preserveof all-cargo and scheduled carriers.     Mr. Wilkens isn't fazed. "We are a forwarders' airline. We willconcentrate on our core (air freight) business and trucking.     "We don't want to go into the business of the forwarders...they are ourpartners. As long as they don't want to get into the airline business wewon't go into theirs."     In time, Cargolux could form alliances with some big freight forwarders,but it will stick to what it does best -- hauling freight. That's why itdecided last June to go ahead with a $100 million plus order for a Boeing747-400F.     Mr. Wilkens, a 30-year veteran of the industry, doesn't think theintegrators provide the only viable strategy for the future.     Forwarders, he said, can give customers services the integrators cannot.An example: If a U.S. computer company wants to get components to a plant inEurope by a certain date, a forwarder can arrange for cheaper sea transportif the delivery schedule is known in advance.     So far, Cargolux is staying ahead of the game with a 37 percent increasein freight ton kilometers, more than double the industrywide growth of 15percent. Its seven Boeings serve a network that spans the globe, and theAsia-Pacific region, the fastest growing air freight market in the world,generated 44 percent of its revenue last year.     Cargolux also intends to build Luxembourg airport into a key Europeanhub. In March, it will open a new 50,000-square meter cargo terminal whichwill double capacity to 500,000 tons a year. The warehouse cannot open soonenough, with Cargolux fast running out of space. Last year air freighttraffic surged by nearly 37 percent to 252,000 tons, making this smallairport the 8th largest air freight center in Europe.     Despite the bumper figures, Cargolux must continue its "relentless"pursuit of cost cutting, according to Mr. Wilkens. Cargolux is a tightoperation with just 735 staff, of which around 550 are based in Luxembourg.But it must boost productivity at one of the higher cost bases in the worldto compete against the low cost Asian and U.S. carriers. One way to remaincompetitive is by flying the most efficient aircraft in the world. The loweroperating costs of the 747-400 more than outweighs the $105 million pricetag. "The 747-400 freighter has given us a clear edge in the market," Mr.Wilkens.     Industry executives say Cargolux has a gold plated guarantee of survivalin the 24.5 percent share held since 1987 by Lufthansa, the world's secondlargest air freight operator, after Federal Express.     There has been speculation in the industry that Lufthansa is keen totake control of Cargolux to add an all-cargo arm to its freight operationjust as it added an integrator with the joint purchase with Japan Air Linesof a controlling stake in DHL, the express and courier operator.     For the time being, Mr, Wilkens "totally rules out" a takeover byLufthansa. It's been a good investment for Lufthansa, he says, yield anaverage 5 percent return compared with 3 percent from Lufthansa's recentlyindependent cargo unit.     The two carriers have a hands off relationship, focusing mainly on waysto jointly have costs, for example, by sharing warehouses. Lufthansa alsobooks space on Cargolux's planes.     Cargolux's local shareholders, Luxair SA, the national airline, and acouple of Luxembourg banks, would also balk at letting go of the company."There's a national feeling about Cargolux. We are the big intercontinentalcarrier for Luxembourg," Mr. Wilkens said. Indeed, Cargolux planes are themost visible symbol around the world of this tiny nation of 370,000inhabitants.     Sometimes, it pays to operate out of a small country. Thus Cargoluxprovided four of the six people in the Luxembourg team that negotiated theopen-skies agreement with the United States that came into force last June.     The payoff for Cargolux came within days of the signing of the accord.For the first time it was able to pick up local freight in Mexico fortransport to Seattle on its regular Luxembourg-Mexico-Seattle run.     The battle for freight, however, is also being waged on the ground, withair cargo companies battling the increasing challenge from door-to-doorintegrators.     Much of that battle is being fought on Europe's freeways where all themajor carriers are trucking cargo from all over the continent to their hubs.Cargolux is keeping pace with the competition, with scheduled trucks carryingbulk and containerized freight between Luxembourg airport and 35 airports inEurope. Non-scheduled trucks operate services to over 80 other cities inEurope. Last year. Cargolux's freight traffic rose by over 30 percent.     In the air the toughest competition comes from subsidized Europeancarriers dumping freight rates and more scheduled carriers getting back intofreight to exploit the current boom. There is also the end of the tight airfreight capacity with the new Boeing 777s coming into service offering thesame capacity as a Boeing 747-100.     But there will always be new business, according to Mr. Wilkens.Computer companies are shipping components from manufacturing facilities allover the world to a small number of assembly plants. And markets are foreverevolving: Ten years ago, Cargolux's business out of Italy was almost allshoes and clothing. Today fashion makes up only 25 percent of its cargo, thebulk now consisting of machinery, chemicals, auto parts, computers, printers,telex machines and electronic goods.

WATER: DECISION HINGES ON THREE FACTORS By Michael Goldstein, AirCommerce Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News     Two hundred years ago, sailors died of scurvy if they couldn't get thevitamin C from fruit that they needed. Voyages were long, ships were slow,and fruit rotted without refrigeration. In an era of moldy hardtack, spoiledbeef and salt pork, the idea of shipping perishable produce from one countryto another was as alien as the thought of living on Jupiter.     Thankfully, there's been plenty of progress since. From delicatecherries and plums to fragile fresh flowers, highly perishable produceroutinely travel by air and sea to hungry markets a continent away. Whatdetermines whether produce goes by air or ocean?     Ron Rembaum, general manager for refrigerated cargo services at MaerskLine, says, "At this point, the vast majority of fresh produce, everythingfrom bananas to cherries, can go by ocean. The only cargo that's really goingby air is the fruit that's most perishable. Berries do not move by water. Ifit's sold as tree-ripened, like cherries from Chile, it goes by air. Butvirtually everything else goes by ocean."     Ocean freight rates for perishables should remain stable this year dueto increased competition from independent carriers like Hanjin Shipping Co.,Hyundai Merchant Marine and Evergreen Marine Corp., all of which have madebig investments in fleets and reefer containers, he said.     But revenue should grow about 5 percent due to higher volume, Mr.Rembaum added. "The demand just keeps growing. Reefer cargo (like produce) isthe cream of the crop, and it pays more than dry container, so we've placedour resources there."     Air freight may be more expensive, but often it's the only way to shipproduce when it absolutely, positively has to be there on time."Perishability is the No. 1 reason, plus the value, because air freight is somuch more expensive," the Maersk executive said.     "Some commodities can't go by air because of the price. Most fruits andvegetables do not carry a high profit margin," he added. "Apples may behigh-volume, but not high-margin, and that rules out air shipping."     Dave Moore, executive vice president of Raymond Express, a freightforwarder in South San Francisco, Calif., that specializes in perishables,said the commodities most likely to be shipped by air are the mostperishable, like cherries or strawberries.     "These products can't go by ocean, where it's a long trip of 10 or moredays to the destination, so there'll be no shelf life when they get there."     Market demand is the other key variable determining whether a productgoes by air or sea. That's especially true when the harvest has just begunbecause demand is high and supply is low, he said, adding that fruit shippedat the start of the season can command a premium price that will more thanpay for shipping costs.     Ocean carriers are deploying a not-so-secret anti-aircraft weapon in theform of controlled-atmosphere containers, which can slow the ripening processand preserve fruits better than refrigeration alone.     "Controlled atmosphere makes ocean even more competitive with air, buteverything relates to cost," said Mr. Rembaum of Maersk. But this methodcosts the shipper over $1,000 additional per container.     While the new technology hasn't caught on as rapidly as its developershad hoped, it's becoming more and more common. A key reason is to cut down onclaims from the shipper.     "We will not accept certain cargoes if we don't think they'll arrivesafely. If commodities like avocados or bananas have a transit time of 20days, we think it will turn out badly, and we'll turn it down," the Maerskofficial said. "When we carry plums or peaches from Chile to the Far East, wewill not accept them without controlled atmosphere. CA is extra insurance forshipper, grower, and line, but the grower and shipper will have to pass alongthe extra cost. And some produce, like citrus or apples, don't work undercontrolled atmosphere all that well."     Mr. Moore of Raymond Express notes that air freight tonnage, especiallyto the Far East, has been consistently growing. While Hong Kong and Singaporehave slightly declined, other Asian markets, like Japan, are stable whileothers are growing far faster than the European market.     "Indonesia, and Thailand are increasing, with their increase indisposable income, the lowering of tariffs, and the consumer's attraction tofresh, healthy, foods," he said.     Air freight rates to Asia have increased by 10 percent to 15 percentover the past year because of strong demand and limited space for cargo onpassenger flights due to higher passenger travel. If prices get too high,more traffic will move by ocean, Mr. Moore said. "The European market, forexample, except for the most highly perishable products, has flipped towardsocean," he said. "The plum business used to be an air business, but now hasmostly flipped towards ocean, except for early harvest."     Because air rates are so high, and because the demand is there, Mr.Moore believes some ocean carriers may be able to raise rates. But, he adds,"if the market continues strong, the carriers will add additional flights.Eventually, the cycle will turn."     Bill Spohrer, president of Miami-based Challenge Air Cargo, whichprimarily ships to and from Latin America, said he expects rates there toremain stable. That is helping Challenge's business, which is growing bothsouthbound and northbound, he said.     Challenge's top item is fresh-cut flowers from South America, which havea very limited shelf life and need to go by air.     Ocean carriers are becoming more competitive with produce, he said,noting that they recently dropped rates into Central America by 25 percent.     "As various countries in Latin America improve their ports and roads,maritime will play a bigger role. We move a tremendous amount of freshasparagus out of Peru.     Some is now going by ship, which never happened before two years ago.But the lion's share still goes by air, because it arrives in better shapeand much faster. Everyone wants everything yesterday." As ports are upgradedto use technologies like controlled atmosphere, and faster ships come online, air carriers more efficient, and they'll offer better service. Therewill always be a difference in price, but the air carriers can grow moreefficient."

A MAJOR REGIONAL AIR CARGO HUB By Phillip Hastings, AirCommerce Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News     Feb. 26--The Promised Land may hold more promise than ever, as worldleaders raise the possibility of an accord between Israel and Syria. Thecontinuation of the Middle East peace process could pave the way for Israelto become a significant air cargo hub for the entire region.     The country might also have a similar role to play in servicing otherneighboring regional markets such as the eastern Mediterranean and parts ofthe former Soviet Union. That, at least, is the optimistic view of localIsraeli air cargo industry executives.     There are, of course, major stumbling blocks on the political front. Apeace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993 and with Jordanin 1994, has still to be followed by an end to the official state of warstill existing between Israel and Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.     And while there is a momentum toward a settlement with Lebanon andSyria, not even the most hopeful observers envisage a settlement with Iraqwhile Saddam Hussein is still in power in Baghdad.     If peace does come to the region, Israel will have to invest heavily --and soon -- to expand its main airport and the nation's general transportinfrastructure.     To that end, Israeli officials have earmarked $1 billion over the nextfour years to Israeli ports, to allow them to rival in size the Persian Gulfports of Jebel Ali and Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.     Israel's basic underlying geographical advantage when it comes tointernational trade and freight gateway activities is spotlighted by MichaelMayer, cargo division director for El Al Israel Airlines.     "If you look at a map you can see that Israel lies on a straight linebetween key Southeast Asian centers like Singapore and much of Europe," hesaid.     The urgent need for further investment to enable Israel to exploit thatgeographical advantage, though, is highlighted by the situation at its maininternational air cargo gateway, Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport.     According to figures supplied by cargo handling company and terminaloperator Maman, annual air cargo traffic growth has averaged 8.6 percent overthe last five years. The final total for 1995 is expected to reach around190,000 metric tons -- more than double the 1985 figure of 92,000 metrictons. And that sort of growth, Maman said, is putting the airport'scargo-handling facilities under pressure.     "The number of cargo movements has increased to the point where we arenow having some difficulties giving the right levels of service to ourcustomers. We are short of facilities and need further expansion," admittedMaman's senior deputy managing director, Isaac Tomer.     Maman is hoping to get the go-ahead shortly for construction of a new$50 million cargo terminal. The 30,000-square-meter facility, which willvirtually double the amount of cargo-handling space available, forms part ofa general "Airport 2000" expansion project at Tel Aviv that also includesplans for a new passenger terminal.     However, Maman said precise timing of the new cargo sector developmentwill be governed to some extent by recent court hearings into objections fromenvironmentalists.     "We have the plans and the budget for the new cargo terminal project butwe do not yet have the land," Mr. Tomer said.     "We hope to get that land by around May this year, with construction ofthe building and systems completed by the end of 1997. That may be a littleoptimistic, though." Current facilities include a main cargo terminal forboth imports and exports of 27,000 square meters, supported by two othersheds of 6,000 square meters (for import consolidations) and 4,500 squaremeters (exports and courier traffic) respectively. In addition, Agrexco(Agricultural Export Company) operates a 5,000-square-meter terminal foragricultural produce exports.     Once the planned new cargo terminal becomes operational, Maman said, theexisting main building will be used solely for handling imports.     Provided that development goes ahead -- and more Arab countries sign airtransport agreements with Israel -- Mr. Tomer believes Tel Aviv could becomeincreasingly interesting to international airlines as a potential regionalhub.     "We have an advantage here in terms of position and direction. Airlinesflying into the Middle East from Europe and North America, for example, couldshorten their flying time by hubbing via Israel," he suggested.     El Al's Mr. Mayer believes there are also opportunities fortransshipping air cargo moving between Western Europe and the former SovietUnion.     "It can make sense to route cargo from Western Europe to southern partsof the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), for example, via Israel. Itis not too much of a detour and there are a growing number of air servicesbetween Tel Aviv and southern CIS points," he said.     In that context, Mr. Mayer believes that the commonwealth states arealready emerging as a potentially important cargo market for El Al. "Theclosest place in Russia, for example, is only two and a half hours' flyingtime away from here," he said.     El Al currently operates scheduled passenger flights to Moscow and St.Petersburg, using both Boeing 747 and 767 aircraft with bellyhold cargocapacity. It also is looking at other service development possibilities insouthern parts of the commonwealth.     In March the airline is due to increase to twice-weekly its weekly 767service from Tel Aviv to Tashkent in Uzbekistan. That move would put El Al ona par with Uzbekistan Airlines, which already operates twice-weekly flightson the same route.     However, if Israel is to develop a general air cargo transshipment rolefor the Middle East region, Mr. Mayer warned, then the country will need toupgrade its rail and road connections substantially.     "For example, the development of land links between Israel and Jordanwould open up the possibility of moving Jordanian air freight via Israel," hesaid.     Such development is already under way. At the beginning of the year,Israel and Jordan agreed to allow their commercial trucks to cross eachother's territory. The same wide-ranging transport agreement also paves theway for the introduction of direct air links between the two countries.     The real prize, though, said the chairman of the Israeli Federation ofForwarders and Customs Clearing Agents, Amir Shani, is the hoped-for futureestablishment of trucking and other transport links between Israel and Arabcountries beyond Jordan, especially those in the Persian Gulf region.     In addition to upgrading its freight transport infrastructures in a bidto become a more significant cargo hub, Israel also is placing considerableemphasis on its technological capabilities, particularly in the field ofcommunications.     A prime example of that is the current move to develop a communityelectronic data interchange system, IFTS (Integrated Foreign Trade System),which will electronically link importers, exporters, public and privatefreight transport organizations, customs and financial institutions such asbanks, along with other overseas communication systems.     IFTS EDI center manager Shaul Abramovich believes that development ofmore sophisticated communications systems will help the general growth ofIsrael as a trade center in a number of ways.     "We can foresee the development of international multimodal transport,with goods arriving in Israel by sea or air and then being trucked on toneighboring countries and further afield to the gulf. That will need to besupported by sophisticated information systems which can plan and track themovement of cargo," he said.     He also noted the trend among multinational manufacturers and suppliersto establish regional distribution centers where they can hold stocks closeto their customers.     "By developing good EDI systems, we can assist those foreign companiesestablishing regional warehouses in Israel to keep in close touch with thoseoperations and quickly access information about stock movements and stockreplacement requirements," Mr. Abramovich added.     Overall, though, Israeli trade and freight industry executives admitted,the development of their country as an international cargo hub remains verymuch linked to the continuation of the peace process with its Arab neighbors.Most appear optimistic that process will continue. END       Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR COMMERCE via NewsNetFebruary 26, 1996JAPANESE MARKET STILL STRONG FOR U.S. GROWERS By Mark Magnier, AirCommerce Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News     TOKYO--Feb. 26--Imported fresh fruits and vegetables will continue to doreasonably well in Japan's affluent and demanding market in 1996 due tochanging consumer tastes and the declining number of Japanese farmers.     "The prospects look real good," said John Child, agriculture counselorat the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. "Farmers are getting older and vegetables arevery labor intensive, so fewer are able to do it."     That said, the American farmer's best friend will continue to be badweather. Japanese demand for imported fruits and vegetables rises mostsharply in years when Japan suffers bad weather and multiple typhoons.     The last time that happened -- 1994 -- U.S. farmers saw enormous demandfor their onions and broccoli, the two largest U.S. fresh vegetable exportshere.     In more normal years, U.S. produce exporters to Japan can expectmoderate growth.     Japan's total imports of fresh fruits and vegetables from all sources in1995 were estimated at $2.6 billion, compared with $2.37 billion in 1994.     Fresh vegetables showed the strongest growth as Japanese consumersrespond to vegetables' perceived health benefits. Fruit -- which has seenrelatively little growth -- evidently doesn't have the same reputation.     "Japanese fresh fruit consumption is modestly declining in favor ofjuice," Mr. Child said.     The United States, meanwhile, expects final figures for 1995 will showtotal vegetable exports to Japan of $259 million, up $6 million over 1994.The relatively small increase is partially explained by the huge jump inimport demand in 1994, which proved difficult to match. The United Statessupplies approximately 29 percent of Japan's fresh imported vegetables.     U.S. fresh fruit should see a healthy $864 million in total 1995 Japansales compared with $785 million in 1994.     A year ago, the first shipment of Washington state apples in 24 yearsarrived in Japan with great fanfare. But the great expectations thatWashington growers held for Japan have failed to materialize as demand hasproven to be rather mild. Japanese consumers, it turns out, find Washingtonapples aren't sweet enough.     In addition, Japan is still not ready to open its market to freshtomatoes grown in the United States, according to officials from the U.S.Department of Agriculture.     Concerns about a plant disease called the tobacco blue mold have held upapproval of U.S. tomato imports. U.S. tomato growers, however, argue thatJapan's domestic tomato industry would face no risk of a blue moldinfestation from imports of U.S. tomatoes. Washington may take the case tothe World Trade Organization.     Nonetheless, U.S. officials in Japan say Japanese consumers are sheddingsome of their traditional distrust of foreign farm products, which havesuffered from a perception that they contain more chemicals and harmfuladditives than domestic varieties.     Some U.S. products, like cherries, broccoli and asparagus, are nowmainstays in Japanese supermarkets.     That's not to say domestic resistence to farm imports has disappeared --particularly when it involves products as emotional to the Japanese as rice.But some U.S. officials say domestic resistance is changing, with accusationsnow more likely to come from fringe consumer groups than the farm lobbiesthemselves.     "It's still a major concern for U.S. produce suppliers," a U.S. officialsaid. "But it's not going to keep you out of the market."     Other countries that have benefitted from Japanese fresh importliberalization are China and Australia. China has done well exporting certainAsian vegetables not widely grown by Australia or the United States.     Australia has a seasonal advantage over the United States for freshfruit and vegetables. Because it's located in the Southern Hemisphere,Australia's growing season complements rather than directly competes withJapan's season.     "We see good prospects for increased access and exports to this market,particularly if Japan's economy recovers," said John Sainsbury, Australia'sagriculture counselor in Tokyo.     On the other hand, when Japan does have a bad weather year, U.S. farmersare in better position to take immediate advantage.     As part of an expanded market presence, U.S. fresh produce exporters arealso trying to expand their distribution channels into this affluent marketby selling directly to regional farm cooperatives, secondary supermarketchains and other emerging players in Japan's changing retail industry.     U.S. farmers are also looking at new potential export products --assuming they can get through Japan's laborious and expensive food safetycertification system. These include tomatoes, plums, new apple varieties andpeppers.     Turning to the traditional large-volume U.S. exports to Japan, onionssaw an increase from January through October of 1995 relative to theyear-earlier period. But a slowdown in the last two months of the year meansthe 1995 totals will probably be lower than last year.     U.S. broccoli exports were up slightly to $114 million in the first 10months of 1995 from $109.2 million in the same 1994 period.     Two factors were at work here, U.S. officials say. Broccoli shipmentsrose sharply in 1994 leading to little growth in 1995 as demand caught upwith supply. Also, higher competition toward the end of 1995, particularlyfrom Australia and New Zealand, meant that prices got squeezed.     Asparagus declined in the first 10 months of 1995 to $32.9 millioncompared with $33.5 million a year earlier.

MIA's designation as a "reinvention lab" last fall by Vice President AlGore is speeding the creation of new systems to slash the time it takespassengers and cargo to pass through Customs checkpoints.     "We're working on every single process we have in Customs to see how tocut down obsolete paperwork," said D. Lynn Gordon, director of the SouthFlorida Customs Management Center in Miami, one of 20 such U.S. centers.     "It's a continuing process. Government resources are not getting anygreater. There's a constant need to reverse and redo, and we'll continue toadjust. Traffic is up 10 percent to 15 percent a year here in Miami," Ms.Gordon said.     Part of Customs' efforts to help re-engineer the airport includeupgrading a computer system that checks passengers' names against a list ofknown smugglers, terrorists or drug traffickers. Those identified throughcomputerization will be singled out for more thorough enforcement procedures.Also under way is a plan to improve MIA's in-transit waiting areas forforeign-to-foreign travel.     "We're trying to improve communication with all inspection, airline andairport personnel. Some of this has a lot to do with airlines and baggagehandlers or immigration. We want to make sure that everyone takes ownershipand joint risk assessments," said Jay Ahren, U.S. Customs Service PortDirector for MIA.     As the hub for trade and travel with Latin America, MIA is poised forcontinued growth as the nation's top cargo airport. International cargo lastyear jumped 25 percent to just under 1.4 million tons. More than 14.4 millioninternational passengers traveled through the airport, a 10.2 percentincrease over 1994.     Customs modernization changes allowed under the North American FreeTrade Agreement Implementation Act are helping to ease regulatoryrequirements for the trade community.     Customs' automated broker interface system is dramatically improvingproductivity for Greyhound Leisure Services Inc., which recently renewed a10-year contract to operate duty-free shops at the airport.     The company has been able to eliminate 300,000 forms it previously hadto file with Customs, according to Phil Salta, customs document controlmanager for Miami-based Greyhound.     "The paperwork required by Customs is being done through more electronicinterfacing. It tremendously speeds up the availability of merchandise thatused to take six to seven days to get. Now, it's about 1.75 from the point ofentry," he said.     Mr. Salta said that Greyhound, which sells liquor, tobacco, perfumes,cosmetics, electronics, glassware and porcelain at MIA's duty-free shops,will save about $300,000 during a three-year period by filing Customs formselectronically.     Bruce Roberts, vice president of operations for Miami InternationalForwarders, which handles both air and sea cargo, said about 35 percent ofhis company's 4,000 monthly clearance and follow-up entries are nowpaperless.     "The program has created benefits for us. We don't have to run outpaperwork for steamship lines, for example," Mr. Roberts said. "We can clearand move cargo without submitting hard documentation to Customs or steamshiplines."     Miami International Forwarders' clients include Epson Computers, SamsungElectronics, Levi Strauss, Liz Claiborne, and Farrah.     Customs' decision to eliminate the requirement for fences separatingdomestic and bonded goods has won praise from the local trade community.     "We had a huge number of good inside fencing. There was no need for thephysical fences and that's saved us at least $100,000. It used to be thatCustoms was on Prozac, and the real driving force for change here has beenLynn Gordon," said Raul Pedraza, president of the Eagle Cos. a Miami-basedinternational transportation and logistics company.     Bonded carriers can now transport merchandise within seaport limitswithout having to obtain a cartman's license, and operators of foreign tradezones, container station and centralized examination stations and bondedwarehouse proprietors can transport merchandise to their facilities.     "It's a form of privatization because we can transport goods under ourown bond," said Mr. Pedraza, past president of the 200-member National BondedWarehousing Cargo Association.     "They've also allowed us to do entry processing electronically, all withone check a month. It's really the first time that government has outsourcedregulations. Now, we have automated systems, with Customs in a supervisoryrole. The streamlining has taken two weeks off the process and has gotten thegoods to move through the port more quickly," he said.     Eagle has about 300 clients and $20 million in annual revenue fromhandling electronics, cruise ship materials such as wines, table goods andspare parts.     Other Customs' streamlining efforts are continuing. Plans are under wayto redesign the agency's Automated Commercial System. Customs CommissionerGeorge Weiss in Washington also is seeking input from the trade community onrevising the Automated Commercial Environment User Requirements Document,part of an overall Strategic Information Management Plan.     In another move, U.S. Customs established five so-called Strategic TradeCenters last October. They are located in Plantation, Fla., west of FortLauderdale, as well as Chicago, Dallas, Long Beach and New York.     "We're part of a new organization that is part of the streamliningprocess. We try to ensure that there is informed compliance with importation.It's a way of helping to protect the domestic industry," said HowardCooperman, deputy director of the 17-staff Plantation Strategic Trade Center."We're getting a much better handle on compliance rates."     Functions of the new domestic trade offices include technical operationsand watchdogging predatory trade practices affecting the U.S. economy.     Priorities of the five offices include embargoes, quotas, transshipmentsand intellectual property rights.

All those stories and a lot more can be found in this month'sAirCommerce.     We begin here at home where this has truly been the winter of ourdiscontent. Record snows, ice storms and wind gusts that have seentemperatures plummet to all-time lows have shown what can happen when acreator has too many toys to play with. And yet, while bloodied and knockedto one knee, North America's air transport system is, pardon the expression,weathering the century's worst winter.     Janet Plume tells how in this month's cover story, "A Winter toRemember".     Elsewhere, the Promised Land is looking more promising than ever. Thereis a saying in the Middle East that roughly translates to "You get a chickenby hatching the egg -- not by smashing it." It is a lesson in patience for aregion that has waited thousands of years for peace.     Today, Israeli officials have taken a decidedly different approach, thatcan best be described as "patience may be a virtue, but it will never help arooster lay an egg."     Phil Hastings looks at the region's new peace initiatives and Israel'saggressive approach to developing itself as the cargo hub for a region ofnearly 500 million residents.     Lockheed's L-1011, once thought to be the airplane that would keep thecompany in the passenger business, has found its niche as a cargo plane. TedReed explains just where.

These kinds of catastrophes, includingHurricane Camille, which killed over 300 people in the South in 1969, or theroaring tornadoes of 1974 that killed some 350 people across the South andMidwest, wiped entire towns off the map.     The winter of '96 included a January blizzard that stretched a thickblanket of snow and ice across 17 states from Kansas City to Boston. Whilelacking the tragic human and property losses of those earlier storms, manystill heralded the blizzard as the "Storm of the Century." Its greatestlegacy, however, will be as the storm from which we finally learned to cope.     Today, in the era of instant media alerts and high-tech communicationsforums, business and homeowners have substantially more lead time to preparefor the worst of weather.     The impact of January's record snowstorm was successfully minimized byresponsive networks in government and business that allowed the corporate andpublic world to sidestep much of the damage before it occurred.Municipalities in the Northeast banned motor traffic from city streets. Hubairports shuttered their hangars, but opened emergency stations for strandedtravelers. Airports and carriers implemented emergency plans on the drawingboards for months and in some cases years.     Despite reducing the loss of life and property exponentially, the impactof January's record lows and devastating icy onslaught was still widespread.Insurers expect to pay out some $585 million in claims, making the storm themost expensive winter blast since 1965, according to the American InsuranceServices Group Inc.     Air carriers alone expect to incur up to $120 million in delays and lostbusiness, according to the Air Transport Association.     Air cargo handlers expect to confront weather-related calamities as partof doing business. But the Blizzard of '96 affected such a large part of thecountry that no air carrier could ignore it.     "This was similar in severity to Hurricane Andrew, but with ice," saidATA economist Dick Swieringa. "It stretched over a big part of the countrythat has an enormous amount of air travel and lasted several days, paralyzingan entire system."     Airports shut down from Washington, D.C., to Boston, with LoganInternational setting a new record for its longest down time since the winterof 1978. Snow drifts in central Pennsylvania reached 7 feet. Nearly 3 feet ofsnow was reported at Baltimore-Washington and Newark, N.J. internationalairports as well as New York's LaGuardia Airport. A state of emergency wasdeclared in some areas as winds gusted up to 60 mph along the Atlantic Coast.Subzero record lows were reported from Kansas to Vermont.     Transportation along the East Coast ground to a standstill.     Chicago's O'Hare Airport, which never actually shut down but hadhundreds of flights canceled, rolled out its stranded passenger program forsix days, offering cots, blankets, pillows, travel kits, coffee andsandwiches to more than 1,200 travelers, most of whom were headed east andcould get no further than the Windy City.     "They came this far and couldn't get where they were going, and thenmany of them couldn't get back to where they had come from," said LisaHoward, Airport Public Relations Director. "We called it Camp O'Hare."     It wasn't just passengers who were stranded. At one point, O'Hare had209 aircraft, many with cargo, sitting overnight on the ground that werescheduled to be elsewhere.     In Philadelphia, airport managers began planning for the blizzard onJan. 5, two full days before the storm hit.     "We had our maintenance and snow removal people in place," said PhyllisVan Istendal, Philadelphia International Public Relations Manager. "When wesaw this coming, we made plans to deal with it."     Mr. Swieringa said the costs incurred by airports will eventually bepassed onto the users in the form of higher landing fees.     "This storm was a very disruptive type of thing," he said. "But it couldhave been worse. One thing we're seeing now is that with higher and higherlevels of automation within companies, they can recover more quickly and gettheir aircraft back into position, be back on schedule more quickly than whenthey had guys with green eye shades."     Delta Airlines canceled more than 1,800 flights during the deluge ofsnow and ice, according to Jackie Pate, corporate communications manager.International flights scheduled for John F. Kennedy Airport were rerouted toAtlanta, Cincinnati and Orlando, Fla.     "The reason that cargo didn't suffer to the extent that the strandedpassengers did is that a lot of customers couldn't get to the airport so itwasn't a case where we had deliveries piling up," Ms. Pate said.     As the worst of the blizzard swooped down Jan. 7 on the East Coast, theimpact on air cargo movement was reduced because Sunday and Monday are theindustry's two lightest days, said Ed Martelle, spokesman for AmericanAirlines' cargo division.     United Parcel Service implemented its winter contingency plan, whichincluded rerouting some shipments to nearby gateway airports -- such aschanging flights scheduled for UPS' main East Coast package-sortingPhiladelphia hub to Louisville, Ky. -- and trucking freight to cities whoseairports were closed, according to Jennifer Giles, a UPS public relationsmanager.     Even by using ground deliveries, the storm's timing enabled UPS todeliver most packages that it picked up Friday to the destination airports.Operations managers at UPS headquarters in Atlanta did encounter difficultiesgathering status reports on deliveries in the snowbound areas.     "That's because all able-bodied management people were out makingdeliveries," UPS spokesman John Flick said.     Dave Fonkalsrud, spokesman for DHL Worldwide Express, said theBrussels-based carrier had to be creative to get its shipments to customersin New York City. On Jan. 9, city officials in New York banned motor vehiclesfrom city streets. Because a large number of DHL's customers are financialinstitutions awaiting letters of credit where an extra day in delivery canamount to a significant loss of interest, 60 DHL couriers devised analternative means of delivering some 6,000 shipments.     They took the subway.     Emery Worldwide's North American Sortation Center in Dayton, Ohio,considered the January blizzard the second winter calamity of the season.     A Dec. 14 snowfall was followed by a warming trend that created steamand thick fog that prevented Emery planes from landing in Dayton.     Tim Strauss, hub operations director, recalls employees going home forthe night and returned at 4 p.m. the next day to join the day-sort team toprocess all the freight.     "But by the time the planes were ready and reloaded, they required majorde-icing, which caused further delays," said Mr. Strauss.     To compensate for an additional lost day, employees returned early againon the third consecutive day to run an extra operation.     Stealing a look at the calender, Mr. Strauss ruefully noted,"Unfortunately, we haven't seen the end of this."

"As regional trade opportunities are expanding, long-standing vehicles(of trade finance) are not always relevant to the changing needs of buyers,sellers, and the institutions which facilitate trade. We're hoping newersystems will satisfy them," said Tom Noonan, president of First Meridian Bankin Coral Gables, Fla. "Most trade between Latin American countries istriangular," said Jim McCollom, executive vice president in the Miami officeof Banco Santa Cruz, a Bolivian bank.     "The goods may move between Brazil and Bolivia, for example, but thetransaction will be financed from Miami. Virtually all such trade has beendollarized. The institutions handling that financing are increasingly basedin the U.S. because that's where the dollars are," added Mr. McCollom, who isalso first vice president of the Florida International Bankers Association.     That doesn't mean the financing is necessarily being handled by domesticinstitutions.     In the past, most Latin trade was financed through Edge Act banks, namedafter a 1919 federal law that allows foreign and domestic banks toparticipate in international trade finance. The debt crisis in the 1980s,together with consolidations and mergers, caused many to withdraw from thescene.     However, some Edge Act banks are still around. Banco SantanderInternational and Standard Chartered Bank, for example, play a major role infinancing trade within the hemisphere. In explaining their continuedactivity, one Edge Act Bank official, while declining to be named, claimedthey offer financing at rates less than half that of Latin American "agentbanks" operating from the United States under similar but different bankinglaws.     Mr. McCollom disputed that assertion. "Although Edge Act banks are morelikely to be dealing directly with both the importer and exporter, rates aremarket driven. While there may be some unique individual situation, and I'mnot aware of any, the claimed differential does not exist."     While most U.S.-based agency banks active in Latin America have theirroots there, some significant agents don't. Two of the largest, Barclay'sBank and Deutsche-SudAmerikanishe Bank, are European.     Mr. McCollom said agency bank volume is growing. "The numbers sayroughly $6 billion was in the system during 1995, but these were almostentirely 90-to-180-day transactions, meaning the money turned over more thanonce. I'd say that figure actually represents about $15 billion to $18billion in trades."     Meanwhile, paperless trading is also gaining ground.     "Import-export finance is about to move off the printed page and ontoyour desktop PC. This will eliminate most of the written documentationcurrently required, and will end the delays, expenses, difficulties inresolving inter-document discrepancies, the back and forth in making changes,and the errors those complexities generate," said Guy Tozzoli, president ofthe World Trade Centers Association Inc.     The New York-based association plans to begin a three-month test of itsnew Full Service Trade System in the United States, Taiwan and France inJuly. Mr. Tozzoli estimated that it will take one and a half to two yearsbefore the system is expanded to a worldwide basis.     WTCA's 303 members, located in 89 countries, will supply traders withsoftware, security codes, pre-approved credit based on local rules, andtraining in the system.     "The funders could be banks, insurance companies or any other kind offinancial institution," Mr. Tozzoli said.     Other concepts are winning attention, too. Tony Brown, senior vicepresident and division head at MTB Bank's Trading Alliance Division in NewYork, said new traders and small ones often find it hard to obtain financingbecause banks wants to see assets and a strong balance sheet.     "They turn away those who lack them. That's where we come in. We dotransaction-based financing."     MTB will control the transaction all the way to the final buyer, Mr.Brown said. "It's important for us to know all the parties involved. We arerigorous in our examination of quality of the goods, knowledgeable in therealities of the market for those goods, and attentive to other factsnormally of no interest to asset-based financiers."     MTB will often buttress transactions with the participation of adomestic correspondent bank, plus insurance against the consequences ofpolitical interruptions and economic disturbances, he said, adding that thismay cost more than traditional financing.     Transactions involving major capital purchases are also encouraging newstrategies. "Let's say a Canadian or U.S. firm is about to supply a powerplant or telecommunication system to a Latin American country," said DavidHarris, president of New York-based Harris Corp. "Unlike consumable goodsfinance, the time frame is five or 10 years. Historically, portions of thisdeal might have involved the issuance of project-specific bonds which majorinstitutions would have bought, either for their own portfolio, or resale.The prime potential source for such funds nowadays is the institutionalinvestor market, but so far an infrastructure is lacking."     Mr. Harris suggested that the U.S. mortgage securities market couldprovide a model for securitizing capital projects. "We're very interested inencouraging such a structure for hemisphere transaction capital, and we thinkthe region offers the best opportunity to apply it."

Now she's lookin' for a cowpoke to take her to the hoedown.     After several grueling years, the Phoenix-based airline surpassed itsrevenue goal in 1995 by $25 million. This month, its stock has traded in theneighborhood of $17 per share and close to its 52-week high of $19 and wellabove the low of $7.675 a share. But hiding in the midst of this revelry wasa disturbing statistic: Following years of expansion, 1995's cargo revenuegrowth was flat.     Even before the year-end result was known, America West had begunsearching for ways to boost cargo revenue, says Tawn Downs, the airline'scargo planning manager and acting director of cargo sales and services. Ms.Downs would like to see double-digit cargo growth for 1996. This year, herdepartment will use a lot of its energy to boost its cargo sales andmarketing skills. To help this effort along, Ms. Downs wants to enhanceAmerica West's cargo automation.     "We were close to selecting a vendor for a new cargo system," Ms. Downssays. "Then we decided to step back and re-evaluate our needs."     In 1995, air cargo represented 3 percent of America West's revenue. Halfthe cargo income was from U.S. mail. About 40 percent was general bulkfreight and the rest was airport-to-airport packages. All of the 65,000 tonsof freight flown was tendered loose. The pieces were individually loaded intothe airline's fleet of narrow-bodied jets and transported through its U.S.route network.     Automating the cargo activity for a passenger airline is a complicatedundertaking. Software engineers say it is more difficult than automating thepassenger system. And unlike the international air cargo business, wherespace is usually booked in advance, most domestic freight arrives at theloading dock without warning. The freight is loose, so the computer must keeptrack of many shipments at one time.     Also, the limited freight capacity of narrow-bodied passenger planestends to produce split shipments, which are harder to track. For example,when a forwarder tenders a shipment of 150 boxes, it may be split into two ormore partial shipments that each travel on a different aircraft with adifferent route to the final destination.     Freight capacity is constantly changing. A load may be balanced betweenpassengers, baggage, mail and freight. Then, a last minute flightcancellation will add dozens of new passengers and bags and the wholeequation has to be recalculated very quickly.     Even though advanced bookings are not the rule in domestic traffic, thesystem must still be able to reserve space for freight with guaranteeddelivery times and for special commodities like human remains that requireadvance booking by law.     Just to make things more complicated, America West is exploring newfreight products and handling methods that will effect its automation needs.     Ms. Downs says the airline is studying the market for counter-to-counterpackages that weigh less than 100 pounds. This category of freight is growingand produces higher yields than heavy freight. Since many of these shipmentsare dropped off at the counter, ticket agents will need access to the cargoreservations system and additional training in how to use it.     So far, Ms. Downs has not been able to find a cargo system that suitsthe airline's needs. "It has to be easy to use and easy to learn," she says."We cannot afford 40 to 80 hours to train a cargo agent. We must keep costsdown. On the other hand, if the system is not easy to use, agents won't useit. That's a proven fact."     Among other things, the ideal cargo system for America West must receiveinformation from the passenger reservation system in order to advise cargohandlers of last-minute gate changes. It must communicate with the new weightand balance system in order to facilitate flight planning. It must providestrong general ledger and accounting services.     It must report on utilization patterns by aircraft, by flight number, bytype of cargo. "If we don't know how we utilize aircraft in a particularmarket, we can't maximize revenue," Ms. Downs says.     Today, America West tracks cargo through an archaic system that residesin its passenger reservations computer, Ms. Downs explains. It lacksinformation on capacity and utilization. "It is not suitable for the way wewant to do business in 1996 and beyond."     Ms. Downs is looking for a cargo system and has reviewed a number ofthem. They either did not offer the right combination of features, could notoperate on America West's brand of computers, or could not justify their highcost, she says.     "People were saying a new system would reduce our freight claims by 60percent," Ms. Downs reports. "That was supposed to save us big bucks. Well,our claims are less than 1 percent, so I don't think so."     Automation can also reduce the time agents spend on the telephone withcustomers and the need to rekey shipment information at various stations."But I still don't see millions of dollars saved here," Ms. Downs says.     "We ought to be able to buy software for a system like this for under $1million," Ms. Downs says. "But I haven't found one product that does it all.And all the other people I talk to in this business say they can't find oneeither."     Anybody want to sashay over to the hoedown?

In the case of this winter's "Storm of the Century," some people mightthink the nation's leading air freight carrier had luck on its side. Ken May,Federal Express Global Operations Control and Coordination Manager, will tellyou his company was merely prepared.     The 17 states from Kansas to the East Coast that were paralyzed byrecord snowfall and subzero temperatures included FedEx's most heavilytrafficked routes. The blizzard hit three of its four U.S. hubs atIndianapolis, Memphis, Tenn. and Newark, N.J. and affected 25 percent to 30percent of its business worldwide.     As the winter storm began its eastward march across the Great Plains,Mr. May put a winter contingency plan, two years in the making, into effect.     "We set up a war room in the control center in Memphis," Mr. May said."Any time from now on when we have a natural disaster, we will mobilize inthis war room with 25-30 people who represent different operating groups inthe company."     The war room crowd talked through the situation and decided how tohandle it. Specialized software provided down-the-line effects of potentialscenarios.     "We sat down and talked about what was facing us," Mr. May said. "Westarted by shutting down the Indianapolis hub on Jan. 2, where they wereabout to get 10 inches of snow."     FedEx rerouted all 40 Indianapolis flights to Memphis, where employeesran a second sorting operation after handling packages for the 120 flightsthat normally arrive in Memphis every night. Packages were delivered on timethe next morning without a hitch. It was the first time FedEx had shut down amajor hub facility and moved the entire operation to another facility.     "This blizzard was one reason that we decentralized several years ago,"Mr. May said. "We realized what could happen to us if we lost our singlemajor hub during one of these catastrophes."     By the time the blizzard reached FedEx's third hub in Newark, N.J., theweekend had arrived.     "The majority of our packages for Saturday delivery are handled inMemphis," Mr. May said. "The packages Newark receives on Saturday are forMonday delivery."     But the New Jersey hub still faced an uphill battle. "They had time ontheir side with the weekend," Mr. May said. "But manpower was the problem;people had a hard time getting to work." Realizing the work force in Newarkwas sorely short-handed, courier packs normally handled in Newark werere-routed to Memphis for sorting. Newark employees were left to sort boxes.     "I feel like we handled that storm flawlessly," Mr. May said. "We keptour service levels high while we managed through it."     Three weeks later, on Groundhog Day, when another icy blast howled intoMemphis, FedEx maintained normal operations while other airlines cancelledflights.     "We brought 120 airplanes in here and out that day with an averagedeparture delay of little more than an hour," said Mr. May.     "We started planning for this type of situation last summer," he said."We spent a lot of hours drilling and training people how to keep runwaysopen in these conditions. We think it's paid off." FedEx has placed a $20million price tag on business lost during the icy blizzard that buried theNortheast this winter. The final cost of the blizzard of '96 will be higherafter FedEx adds in the extra expense it incurred coping with the storm. Butthe innovative Memphis air freight carrier could have been hurt a lot worsewithout its war plan, Mr. May said.

With the recent proliferation of regional trade pacts, customs officialsfrom Canada to Chile have joined forces to begin simplifying the maze.Governments are working together to streamline paperwork and cut back on redtape, expedite cargo clearance at border crossings, harmonize rules of originand rid agencies of fraud and corruption.     For example, Canada, Mexico and the United States are poised tointroduce a prototype for standardized electronic documentation to cleargoods through customs at their borders. The Information Exchange andAutomation Working Group, a trilateral panel created under the 1994 NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement, is spearheading the project.     "The problem with our borders is not that free trade doesn't work. It'sthe fact that we don't get information on these transactions until theshipment arrives," said Robert Ehinger, director of international trade dataexchange for U.S. Customs.     Under the program, the three countries would standardize trade datagathered by customs officials to the point where cargo documentation arrivesat the border crossing before the truck or train does. This way, customsofficials would have enough information to decide whether to stop theshipment for inspection or let it move through immediately.     The procedure will apply to automotive parts, beer and liquor,electronics, fresh fruits and vegetables, lumber, newsprint, steel, textilesand apparel at two U.S.-Canada crossings and four Mexico-U.S. crossings. Theprototype was originally scheduled to be used in the field for a minimum ofsix months beginning in January, but will probably not be launched until thefall, Mr. Ehinger said.     He attributed the delay in part to the U.S. government shutdowns inrecent months, adding that the schedule depends on getting the propertechnology in place along the borders.     Officials are also working to develop a hemisphere-wide customsprocedures guide, one of the mandates trade ministers from 34 nations setlast June during a summit meeting in Denver to prepare countries for afree-trade zone spanning North, Central and South America. The ministers willmeet again in March to work toward making hemispheric integration a realityby 2005.     In early February, the Working Group on Customs Procedures and Rules ofOrigin, one of seven technical groups established during the summit, met inLa Paz, Bolivia, to start work on the guide. Group members also begandiscussing ways to simplify customs procedures, identify areas for technicalcooperation in customs operations such as computerized networks and fraudprevention as well as to develop a transparent system of rules of origin.Origin rules, which determine where a product is made or what percentage of aproduct is made in a specific country, are pertinent because countries usethem to determine the product's tariff treatment.     A U.S. customs official who was present at the meeting stressed theimportance of "understanding that we're developing things the same way andthat we're talking about the same things."     Several South American countries are following the same approach. "Withregard to customs, Mercosur is working hard to coordinate policies andbureaucratic standards," said Eva Holz, a commercial law professor at theState University of Uruguay Law School.     Ms. Holz referred to efforts among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay andUruguay, the four members of the Southern Cone Common Market customs unionknown as Mercosur, to harmonize complicated tariffs and customs regimes. Forexample, "in the past, importers and exporters had to go through customspaperwork with several different state agencies. The countries have agreed tostreamline this whereby you only have to go through customs," she said.     In addition, Brazil, which has both federal and state regulations, hasmade headway in simplifying requirements.     Ms. Holz stressed that continued economic reform, especially in Braziland Argentina, Mercosur's two largest economies, would be key to pushing thecustoms standardization process forward.     Felipe Garcia, an adviser with the National Law Center forInter-American Free Trade in Tucson, Ariz., agreed, saying that moreopen-door economic policies as well as the advent of high-tech customssystems would facilitate the development of unified codes and practices."Because of technology and other factors this area of trade policy will beeasier to harmonize and change than others," Mr. Garcia said.

With hundreds of players in the global market, the task of keeping upwith the scope of events, issues and trends in the express air courierindustry could keep even a prolific carrier pigeon tied to his typewriter 24hours a day.     This column, nonetheless, will make a noble, monthly attempt to visittopics of interest to international couriers, to take note of those whosupport their businesses, and to illuminate those who stand in their way. Thenumber of companies involved in this industry is large and getting larger --the Air Courier Conference of America, in Washington, counts over 110corporate members alone. And counterpart organizations elsewhere in the worldare expanding rapidly, too.     As has often been the case with globalization, the expansion rate of thecourier market outside the United States is distinctly faster than within.According to Air Cargo Management Group, of Seattle, the international marketfor air courier express shipments is growing at a rate of 25 percent a year,compared with a mere 15 percent domestic U.S. growth rate.     Lee Hibbets, research director for the consultants' group, saysinternational shipments constitute about a fifth of the volume of daily U.S.shipments, just nosing past the 5.5 million mark.     But it will not take long for international shipments to exceed the U.S.level. Carriers are moving into new regions, new countries and new airportsas fast as they can stencil a new "Open For Business" sign.     In Latin America, a hot market for air couriers, a regional organizationworking to remove trade barriers is the Conferencia Latino Americana deCompanias Express, or Cladec, which is registered in Panama. Among othertargets, the group is focusing on customs agencies to get them to modernizeclearing technology, encouraging national governments to lift surcharges, andpressing congressmen to rewrite laws to facilitate air courier shipments."We've successfully worked with customs in several of the (South American)southern cone countries," confirmed Susan Lyon, a spokeswoman for the LatinAmerican business of DHL WorldWide Express, a member of Cladec.     Indeed, DHL has had such positive results over the last few months witha pilot program in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru, that thecarrier plans in April to expand the billing decentralization program to atotal of 38 countries around the globe, she said. The new system permits afactory manager in Peru, for example, to order parts or supplies from a U.S.manufacturer and pay for the shipment through a local account, rather thanusing the U.S. shipper's account, she explained.     Cladec, in turn, is encouraging the formation of country associationsfor air couriers throughout Latin America, to help galvanize change on alocal level. Thus far, 15 country associations have been formed in LatinAmerica, according to Larry Burtchaell, the executive director of Cladec."We're just getting started in the Caribbean now," noted Mr. Burtchaell, onhis way to Lima for a group meeting with a number of Peruvian officials.     Since no single air courier can hope to have enough aircraft oremployees to serve every airport in the world, strategic cooperation is thebylaw of this industry, in contrast with others. While DHL carries out arecently announced $30 million upgrade of its hub in Panama, the company hasforged agreements with American Airlines and other carriers to handle itsexpress shipments in the southern cone of South America. "There must be 20different (cooperative) combinations that companies use to get the materialswhere they go," said Ms. Lyon.     That's 20 permutations of the global combinations of several hundredplayers in the market, each of which forms extended geographic networks thatare constantly shifting as the market expands and matures. Schedules andpricing, of course, are easier to track.

Modern technological advancements incooling and transporting perishables are keeping produce fresher longer.     When it comes to perishable produce, two things are paramount: theintegrity of the cooling process and the rapid movement of freight. Three newtechnological developments offer great promise in these areas: vacuumcooling, improved temperature recording and satellite-driven tracking andtracing of cargo.     Vacuum cooling involves the extremely rapid evaporation of water fromfruits and vegetables. Even when produce is cooled, humidity can causedegradation. Used for decades to cool iceberg lettuce, which is extremelysusceptible to cold water damage, vacuum cooling systems have only recentlybeen modified to cool other types of produce.     In January, Lufthansa purchased a vacuum cooling system from PackagedRefrigeration Systems Inc., a Jacksonville, Fla.-based manufacturer ofindustrial refrigeration systems for its new perishable-cargo terminal atMiami International Airport.     "Vacuum cooling provides a better means by which perishables can bepreserved for transportation," said Mel Torre, a Lufthansa spokesman in NewYork.     "The problem with air cooling is that it's inefficient," said StanBadenhop, director of produce cooling equipment at Packaged RefrigerationSystems. "You can't get the cool air to be in contact with the entire producepallet. If you have several boxes of fruit, for example, stacked on a pallet,it's impossible to cool the central boxes, which are blocked by the adjacentcartons."     With vacuum cooling, produce is put on a conveyor and moved into a steelvacuum chamber with doors at either end. The pallets are rolled in, the doorsclose, the vacuum pumps turn on and the air is evacuated. The product is thencooled to its optimum level. The process takes 45 minutes to an hour.     Moving perishable commodities requires that they remain within a fewdegrees of this optimum level of coolness. A new temperature monitoringsystem developed by Ryan Instruments in Redmond, Wash., not only helps motorcarriers maintain the appropriate levels, but also provides a computerizedhistory of the freight's temperature.     "Our new devices offer continuous monitoring of perishables throughoutthe cold chain," said Dan Vache, a Ryan vice president. "At any time duringthe cold cycle, you can download information telling you the temperature ofthe freight at any given time."     If a shipper sets the temperature gauge at 38 degrees for a particularperishable product, and the temperature either drops below or rises abovethat level, a red indicator light flashes. Downloading of the monitor's datawill indicate precisely when the temperature changed. The new monitoringsystem is particularly effective in resolving disputes over degraded produce.     "Let's say you have a restaurant in Los Angeles that wants its producedelivered early in the morning and left out on the back dock," he said. "Theshipper gets the freight there on time, but the restaurant's workers show uplate to move it off the dock. The produce degrades in the heat, andaccusations fly."     With Ryan's new monitoring device, a computer read-out of thetemperature data will reveal exactly when the freight dipped below the targetcooling level.     Satellite communications is another new technology helping to meet thejust-in-time inventory requirements of fresh produce sellers and buyers.     "If a receiver of produce has to have a load diverted, we can re-routeour trucks within minutes," said Jack Liles, president of the rail servicesdivision at KLLM Transport Services Inc. KLLM, a Jackson, Miss.-basedrefrigerated motor carrier, mounts satellites on the roofs of its trucks toprovide two-way communications. Each truck driver is equipped further with acomputer and modem, allowing the transfer of a wide range of data.     The new system has been a boon to produce buyers, Mr. Liles said. Herecalled one shipper who decided that the temperatures set for a shipment oftomatoes were too low. "The shipper called us and wondered if thetemperatures could be hiked up a bit," he said. "We contacted the driver, hadthe temperatures changed, and called back the customer five minutes later."

As U.S. growers expanded into the global arena, exports of freshvegetables inched up 3 percent to nearly 1.8 million tons in the fiscal yearthat ended last Sept. 30, according to U.S. Department of Agriculturefigures.     Fresh fruit shipments, however, dipped about 1 percent to just under 2.7million metric tons. Shipments to Mexico plunged 41 percent to 159,167 tons,due to the peso crisis and economic turmoil there, while exports to Canada,by far the largest market, fell 5 percent to 824,808 tons.     Exports to Mexico have also been hit by a trade dispute stemming from aU.S. ban on Mexican avocado imports.     Growth in new Asian and Latin American markets, however, nearly offsetthe drop in shipments directly north and south of the U.S. border. Tomatoes,cherries, apples and other fruits have become hot commodities among anincreasingly Westernized population in the Pacific Rim and in Latin America.     The virtual explosion of new trade opportunities has made consumer foodsthe largest and fastest growing segment of global agricultural trade. Themarket is now estimated at close to $200 billion worldwide.     Lettuce, potatoes and onions led the list of fresh vegetable exports in1995. More than two-thirds of all exported vegetables were shipped to Canadalast year. The United States' northern neighbor, whose colder clime and shortgrowing season limit fruit production, has slowed its imports from the UnitedStates in the past three years.     In 1993 when U.S. fresh vegetable exports reached a record, 40 percentof those sales went to Canada and Mexico. U.S. exports to its two closestneighbors had skyrocketed 1,000 percent since 1988.     Fresh fruit and vegetable exports to some parts of Latin Americadeclined last year due in part to phytosanitary concerns. In November,Ecuador shut its borders completely to U.S. fresh fruit and vegetableimports, holding up shipments for two weeks until representatives of theUSDA's Foreign Agricultural Service convinced authorities that thecrop-damaging Oriental fruit fly was discovered outside California's growingregions and would not appear in imports.     Sheena Kuruvilla, international trade manager for the United Fruit andVegetable Association, said Mexican agricultural leaders are using U.S.exports as a political handball.     "Mexico has said that if the United States refuses to remove barriersagainst Mexican avocados, they will impose barriers against U.S. exports suchas apples," she said.     Mexico has petitioned the USDA to permit avocado imports, which havelong been banned for sale in the United States because of inadequate Mexicanpest controls. Mexican growers argue they have substantially improved theirpest control methods and the U.S. ban amounts to a non-tariff trade barrier.Florida and California avocado growers have campaigned against dropping theban. Mexican leaders have threatened to retaliate with bans on various U.S.products.     Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has indicated he would drop the banif the pesticide issue has been addressed.     "Countries will use bad science to keep us out, but the rules have towork both ways," Mr. Glickman recently told a public policy conferencesponsored by the Alexandria, Va.-based fruit and vegetable association, whichbegins its annual conference today in New Orleans.     Last month, Colombia, which buys the bulk of its apples and pears fromthe Pacific Northwest, threatened to impose a fumigation requirement on allU.S. fresh fruit and produce shipments.     Colombia is the No. 3 market for Washington State apples, behind Braziland Mexico, buying some 444,000, 42-pound cartons last year. The region alsosent more than 60,000 cartons of pears to the Colombia.     Colombian officials insist the Oriental fruit fly doesn't exist in theircountry, and could be introduced in U.S. shipments. Argentina, Brazil andEcuador have passed similar measures.     Colombian officials later suspended the fumigation order after U.S.growers protested the practice. But they still require a special certificatestating the fruit originated in a state where the Oriental fruit fly has notbeen detected.     U.S. growers are not eager to begin fumigating because the process iscostly and can damage the produce being treated.     Ed Brooks, Latin American marketing director for the Washington AppleCommission, said the Colombian fumigation requirement could have had a majorimpact on sales.     "Our fruit was more expensive this past season because of the smallercrop," Mr. Brooks said. "It's difficult to stay competitive with other appleproducers such as Chile."     Last fall's apple harvest in Washington State, which exports aboutone-third of its apples, reaped 80 million boxes, down from 92 million boxesin 1994. While the state produces about half the national harvest, itaccounts for 90 percent of all U.S. apple exports.     Washington State's apple exports to Mexico shrank about 50 percent lastseason to 4 million boxes. James Thomas, spokesman for the Washington AppleCommission, said the devaluation of the peso and continuing economic turmoilcontributed to the decline.     Asia is expected to become a major consumer of fresh foods over the nextfive years as portions of the Uruguay Round are enacted, including subsidyand tariff reductions.     But California exporters are worried that customers such as Japan andSouth Korea could cancel the $26 million in U.S. fresh fruit and vegetablesthey buy each year if California growers lose an irreplaceable crop fumigant.The sale of methyl bromide is scheduled to be banned in California March 30along with some 200 other chemicals under a state birth defects preventionlaw.     Both Japan and Korea require pre-export fumigation with methyl bromideon certain stone fruits and cherries. Considered to be damaging to the ozonelayer, methyl bromide is scheduled to be phased out of use in the UnitedStates by 2001.     Another hot market for U.S. fruit and vegetable growers is China, whichopened its market to U.S. apples in 1994. However, imported apples incur a 40percent tariff duty plus a 16 percent value-added that tax keeps costs highand volume low.     Hong Kong is an important market for grapes and oranges, while Taiwan isthe largest importer of U.S. apples.     The first shipment of Florida grapefruit since trade barriers came downmade its way to Thailand last year. U.S. exporters pay a 57 percent tariff,which is reduced 3 percent each year. But 1996 exports of any of Florida'sproduce are likely to become more expensive this year in the wake of a deadlyfreeze that gripped the nation earlier this month. The rise in prices causedby the shortages is likely to result in lower export volume, agricultureofficials said. END          Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR COMMERCE via NewsNetFebruary 26, 1996TRADE BATTLES CLOUD AGRICULTURAL IMPORT FORECAST DESPITE RISING DEMAND By Janet Plume, AirCommerce Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News     NEW ORLEANS--Feb. 26--As the first baby boomers turn 50 this year, thesex, drugs and rock 'n roll generation is turning to healthier living habits,which is good news for fresh fruit and vegetable importers.     Americans ate a record 100 pounds of fresh fruit per capita in 1994,according to the Department of Agriculture. While final figures for 1995haven't been released, that number is expected to be up about 15 percent.     Fresh fruit imports were expected to approach 1.9 million tons lastyear, up more than 16 percent from 1994. Fresh vegetable imports wereestimated to top 2.5 million tons at year's end, up some 14 percent from1994's tally of nearly 2.2 million tons.     Bananas lead the U.S. fresh fruit import crop, with more than twice asmany tons shipped into the United States as the combined total for all otherimported fruits. Melons, mostly from Mexico, and grapes, mostly from Chile,rank second and third.     Tomatoes, almost all from Mexico, rank as the top vegetable import,followed by potatoes, which come exclusively from Canada and cucumbers, forwhich Mexico is the only source.     With consumer demand rising, the outlook for fresh fruit and vegetableimports would appear to be rosy, boosting free-trade efforts on the road tohemispheric integration. But U.S. farmers increasingly view the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement as a raw deal. Phytosanitary standards havebecome major stumbling blocks among the 34 countries attempting to reach aFree Trade Agreement of the Americas by 2005.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has been traveling the globe inthe past six months pressing countries to drop unscientifically founded,anti-pest barriers to U.S. farm products. His leverage for making suchdemands rests in part on proof that the United States itself is willing totake the politically painful step of eradicating its own non-tariff barriersto farm product imports.     U.S. farmers, though, are loudly protesting surges in imports fromMexico and Canada, arguing the increased supply drives down prices below costlevels. Shortly before Christmas last year, Florida growers dumped hundredsof pounds of beans, eggplant and squash into a parking lot to call attentionto the more than 50 percent increase in Mexican shipments of cucumbers,eggplants, peppers, squash and tomatoes. Earlier this month, FloridaAgriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford issued an order halting every truck inthe state carrying foreign produce and subjecting it to new health and safetyinspections.     Free-trade proponents say the real problem with Mexican imports lieswith the collapse of the peso, making Mexican fruits and vegetables muchcheaper to sell in the U.S. market.     The administration's push to lift an 81-year-old ban on Mexican avocadosis one such example.     Last year, Mexico petitioned the USDA to lift the ban on its Haasavocado, which was imposed because of Mexico's poor pest controls. Mexicangrowers claimed they had gone to great lengths to eradicate pests and thatthe U.S. ban amounted to a non-tariff trade barrier.     Last July, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Serviceproposed lifting the import ban, saying a study had concluded Mexicanavocados would not bring pests into California, where 90 percent of U.S.avocados are grown.     Florida and California avocado growers campaigned fiercely to keep theban. USDA received some 2,000 letters from growers protesting a change in theban.     Rules set down under the Uruguay Round world trade agreement specifythat countries can't bar imports of agricultural products without a soundscientific reason. Avocado growers claim imports would pose a high risk tothe U.S. crop, cited a University of California study last fall thatchallenged Aphis' conclusions.     The newer study concluded that certain species of fruit fly wouldprobably become established in California in three to 50 years after importsbegan. Aphis had said the fruit fly wouldn't be established for 1 millionyears.     Advocates of lifting the ban argue the risk to the growers is economicrather than a threat to the health of their crops. Mexican imports havedriven down prices of tomatoes, grapes and brussels sprouts this winter.     Earlier this month, the Agriculture Department began moving forward withplans to lift the ban and allow Mexican avocados to be imported into 19northeastern states. Mark Affleck, president of the California AvocadoCommission, said he had confirmed the USDA was reviewing a final rule to beissued by the office of general counsel.     Mr. Affleck said his group would oppose the rule in federal court.     Similar trade disputes between the United States and other countriescould be affected by the avocado controversy. Exporters of stone fruits inCalifornia and the Pacific Northwest say their products are prohibited fromentering Mexico because of the U.S. ban on avocados.     In Florida, tomato growers have vociferously opposed the increased levelof Mexican tomatoes entering the United States, which they insist amounts todumping. U.S. imports of Mexican tomatoes shot up 40 percent during the12-month period between Oct. 1, 1994 and Sept. 30, 1995 to 534,345 tons,which represented 96 percent of all U.S. tomato imports during that period.     NAFTA allows Mexico to ship a certain amount of tomatoes to the UnitedStates at reduced tariff rates. Once the quota level is exceeded, the normalimport tariff kicks in, adding about one-half cent a pound to the cost ofimported tomatoes. But the slow pace in measuring those imports in early 1995produced a months-long delay in finding that Mexico had exceeded its quota.The delay lasted long enough for the tomatoes to reach U.S. supermarkets.     U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor proposed rectifying thesituation by measuring imports on a weekly basis rather than semi-annuallyduring each growing season, as is the current practice.     Customs officials have warned they lack the resources to monitor tomatoshipments and alter tariff rates every week, and have speculated such a rulecould result in mountains of tomatoes rotting on U.S. borders.     Mexican growers argue the natural peaks of the tomato season duringJanuary and February and the unreliability of weather conditions cannot beregulated to keep tomato shipments uniform throughout the season.     Florida growers, who believe they have not received promised protectionfrom Mexican imports, argue the weekly quota would allow them to deal withsurges in imports that cause disruptions in their ability to set prices thatcover costs. Only a tiny portion of the Florida winter vegetable crop isexported, so NAFTA -- which has received much stronger support from growersdependent on exports -- has simply produced more competition for them.     Mexican officials, who have denounced the bill as a protectionist biasthat violates NAFTA, have threatened retaliation against U.S. exports ofmeat, grain and dairy products if Congress approves a bill backed by theFlorida Fruit & Vegetable Association. The bill would redefine who canqualify for import protection under U.S. trade law and make producers of"seasonal" perishable commodities eligible for relief.     In California, U.S. table grape growers are considering levying chargesthat Mexican producers have dumped their product on the American market.Imported fruits and vegetables are normally sold for a price that ispredetermined by the importer and the wholesaler before the shipment arrives.     Sometimes fruit is sold on consignment, when the shipper tells the buyerto get whatever price he can. Domestic farmers contend consignment imports,which skyrocketed last summer in California during grape growers' peakseason, destabilize the market by driving down prices. They also claim it canprovide growers a vehicle to divert large quantities of a certain product toa specific market, which would constitute dumping.     Growers contend Mexican bankers urged Mexican grape growers to dumptheir produce on the U.S. market in 1995 after the peso's collapse. Importsof Mexican grapes nearly doubled last year, rising from some 41,085 metrictons during fiscal 1994 to 80,501 metric tons during fiscal 1995.     California growers harvest nearly two-thirds of the nearly 2 billionpounds of red, green and black table grapes consumed annually in the UnitedStates. The bulk of the remainder is imported from Chile and Mexico.     While much of the concern over U.S. imports stemmed from domesticgrowers in the past year, an 11th-hour, 1995 decision by the CaliforniaSupreme Court scored a major victory for free trade.     The state high court struck down an inspection fee collected since 1992by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. The Pacific MerchantShipping Association estimates the department will have to return nearly $3million to shippers who paid the fees during the past three years on foreignagricultural products. It's not immediately known whether the decision willalso affect similar fees that have been collected from airlines, who paid outabout four times as much as ocean carriers. A handful of domestic airlineshave filed lawsuits protesting collection of the inspection fees.     Shippers had argued the fee was discriminatory because domestic shippersdidn't pay a similar fee when agricultural goods were trucked across statelines.

Unlike other cherrygrowers in Lodi, Calif., his company, M&R Packing, was insured.     Indeed, 1995 was the pits for California's sweet cherry industry. Heavyrains throughout April and May decimated the fragile fruit. Growers ended upshipping barely 500,000 18-pound packages of fresh cherries, down from about3.8 million packages in 1994. "It was a disaster," said Mr. Reynolds,co-owner and vice president of M&R, which farms cherries on about 400 acres.     Serendipity, however, had knocked at his door only a few months earlier.American Agrisurance Inc., a Fresno, Calif.-based insurer, decided it wouldtake the plunge and provide loss and damage insurance to the state's cherrygrowers.     "Thanks to American Agrisurance, we were able to collect about $2,500 anacre for our losses," Mr. Reynolds said. "That money was a godsend."     For American Agrisurance, however, the tremendous losses were a hellishreminder of how risky the cherry insurance business can be. After just oneyear of insuring cherries, the company has pulled up stakes, convinced thefruit is uninsurable. "Right now we don't want anything to do with cherries,"said Chuck Luna, American Agrisurance field representative.     Mr. Luna explained that high cherry losses are only part of its decisionto call it quits. "The biggest problem is the reinsurance market, which won'ttouch cherries for beans," he said. Reinsurance is bought by insurancecompanies to help spread their risks.     That creates a dilemma for farmers like Mr. Reynolds and others inCalifornia. American Agrisurance was the only private insurance carrier inthe state willing to consider cherry coverage. "We had one insurer in here inabout 1992 or 1993, but then they lost their shirts and never returned," Mr.Reynolds recalled.     The U.S. Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency, which providesinsurance on almost every fruit and vegetable farmed today, won't touchcherries either. "We had a program years ago, but we terminated it. Right nowthere's no insurance for cherry growers," said William Murphy, regionalservice director in the risk management division of the agency, whichreplaced the Federal Crop Insurance Corp.     While the government's Non-insured Agricultural Program (NAP) offerspost-disaster financial assistance to cherry growers, the criteria forreceiving funds is very stringent. NAP funds, which are limited anyway, onlykick in after 35 percent of growers in a county suffer a 50 percent loss oftheir average yield.     The lack of any kind of risk transfer mechanism for cherry growers isnothing new, according to Jim Culbertson, manager of the California CherryAdvisory Board, a quasi state-industry organization promoting the cherryindustry. "It's been a problem on and off for years," Mr. Culbertson said."Now and then, a courageous insurer like American Agrisurance will buck theodds and offer insurance. But that's usually the exception, not the rule."     Many insurers, such as Chicago-based CNA Insurance Cos., write cherryinsurance only if it's a small part of a large farm's business. "It's justtoo volatile," said Lance Mallinson, CNA vice president of commercial lines."The loss ratios are horrendous."     The vulnerability of sweet cherries is pronounced when compared withother fruits. Cherries are highly susceptible to frost, rain and otherweather conditions. One of the most common production perils is rain nearharvest time, which causes "rain cracking," a condition encouraging fungalinfection.     Exacerbating the problem is a high demand for dark red cherries,especially among Pacific Rim importers. The darker the cherry the longer itmust remain on the tree before harvest. "Dark cherries almost invitedisaster," said Mr. Luna.     The situation has become so grim for California's cherry growers thatthey appealed to the federal government to reconsider its posture againstinsuring the fruit. "We got together with the San Joaquin Agricultural Officeand various consolidated farm services offices in the state to ask the farmservices agency to reconsider cherries for an insurance program," Mr.Culbertson said.     Mr. Murphy said he received the growers' letter at an opportune time."We had just ordered a study on the feasibility of insuring sweet cherries,"he noted. "The report (by the Economic Research Service of the U.S.Department of Agriculture) indicated that such a program was feasible."     The USDA report concluded there would be widespread participation amongsweet cherry growers in a catastrophic insurance plan -- if the premiums werelow enough and the benefits ample.     "The conclusion is that sweet cherries are insurable, but the risks areso significant that we will need to proceed with caution," Mr. Murphy said.The next step in the process is a focus group meeting with growers in Marchto determine their interest in participating in the insurance program, headded.     "We've got a number of different coverage plans that we'd like to floatto the growers to see which fits them best," Mr. Murphy said. "I'm hopefulthat come this cherry season, we'll have a program up and running."

While both markets continue to show promise of strong growth, exportersare turning their eyes toward relatively new markets in the Pacific Rim wheremany countries have experienced trade liberalization, rising incomes andincreased consumer demand for fresh products.     Apples, oranges and grapefruit lead the U.S. fresh fruit export marketin that order. Approximately half the 663,054 tons of apples, 599,385 tons oforanges and 481,744 tons of grapefruit that were shipped abroad last yearwent to Asia.     Japan, the largest net food importer in the world, is second to Canadain overall imports from the United States and normally ranks as the largestU.S. market for grapefruit, oranges, cherries and some other fruits.     On another front, California exporters worry that some foreign customerssuch as Japan and South Korea could cancel the $26 million in U.S. freshfruit and vegetables they buy each year when California growers lose anirreplaceable crop fumigant. Next month, a state birth defects prevention lawwill ban the sale of methyl bromide along with some 200 other chemicals. Aspecial session of the state legislature is considering repeal of the law.     Both Japan and Korea require pre-export fumigation with methyl bromideon certain stone fruits and cherries. Scientists believe methyl bromidedamages the ozone layer, and the fumigant is scheduled to be phased out ofuse in the United States by 2001.     "There is research under way to find viable alternatives," said SheenaKuruvilla, international trade manager for the United Fruit and VegetableAssociation. "If we are left with nothing else to use but fumigants, then wewill have a problem. But if we come up with a viable alternative it willdepend on how good that viable alternative is."     China, which began importing U.S. apples in 1994, is another hot marketfor U.S. fruit and vegetable growers. However, imported apples are subject toa 40 percent tariff, plus a 16 percent value-added tax that keeps costs highand volume low. U.S. growers also dislike the Chinese rule that requiresmedfly traps in every warehouse where apples are stored for shipment toChina. Exporters say the traps are unnecessary because the medfly could notexist in the Northwest's cold climate.     The first shipment of Florida grapefruit since trade barriers came downmade its way to Thailand last year. U.S. exporters pay a 57 percent tariff,which is reduced 3 percent each year. But 1996 exports of any of Florida'sproduce are likely to become more expensive this year in the wake of a deadlyfreeze that gripped the nation earlier this month. The rise in prices causedby the shortages is likely to result in lower export volume, agricultureofficials said.     The United States has been the major supplier of fresh fruits andvegetables to Taiwan for several years. The top U.S. seller in this categoryis apples, followed by grapes, plums, grapefruit and other citrus products.U.S. kiwis have held onto a lead market share in the face of new competitionfrom French and Chilean imports, as well as from traditional New Zealandsuppliers. U.S. exporters nearly dominate the fresh onion, lettuce and celerymarkets in Taiwan.

From Wire and Staff Reports EXPD,SUNW END           Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR COMMERCE via NewsNetFebruary 26, 1996LACK OF FEDERAL FUNDS DELAYS MANY PROJECTS TO RELIEVE AIRPORT CONGESTION By Ted Gogoll, AirCommerce Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News     Feb. 26--A consistent shortfall in government funding has forced U.S.airports to seek alternative financing for needed projections and raised thecry for creation of a National Aviation Infrastructure Development Bank.     Airports that have traditionally relied on the Airport ImprovementProgram (AIP) to fund construction projects have found a growing gap betweenthe money authorized by Congress and the actual funds legislators are makingavailable.     The funds, which are distributed by the Federal Aviation Administration,are used to improve and construct runways, taxiways, aircraft parking apronsand to modernize safety and efficiency equipment.     While the authorizations have annually increased, the amount of moneyactually appropriated by Congress has decreased from a high of $1.9 billionin 1992 to $1.45 billion in 1996, a figure airport officials say isinadequate to handle their expansion needs. To meet the shortfall, airportshave had to rely increasingly on tapping the bond market, using passenger andshipper fees.     "We have done a periodic survey to find out what airports really needover a five-year period. We consistently see that airports (collectively)need at least $10 billion a year in capital development funding," said RobWigington, senior vice president of Airports Council International-NorthAmerica, an organization that represents local, state and regional governingbodies that own commercial service airports in the United States, Canada andBermuda.     Even when the airports pool all of their financial resources, they stillfall short of necessary funding.     "Congress is saying that airports are bringing in $3.5 billion in bondsoutside of the AIP, and the passenger and shipper taxes would bring in anadditional $1 billion a year with less than $7 billion in total. The airportsstill need $3 billion more a year, but that's the best the (AIP) programcould do," said Mr. Wigington.     According to the FAA, 22 airports in the United States have "serious"congestion problems, experiencing more than 20,000 hours of delay a year.These delays result in $32 million in added costs to airlines. The FAAforecasts that, unless necessary capacity investments are made, the number ofcongested airports will increase to more than 32 by the year 2006.     Addressing the two-headed problem, FAA Administrator David Hinson said,"We cannot afford the billions of dollars in annual delay costs and lostproductivity to the airlines, air travelers and businesses, nor can we affordto weaken our economic competitiveness abroad, by permitting an inefficientand inadequate air transportation system."     Meanwhile, the lack of funding has placed many projects on the backburner. The Airports Council International's Mr. Wigington placed the backlogat about $8 billion, with some projects sitting on the shelf for upwards ofseven years.     "When we apply for grants, we apply between October and January.Generally, right after the first of the year, the grant will comethrough...But these projects have been on the books for several years at theFAA," said Chip Snowden, manager of aviation planning for JacksonvilleInternational Airport.     Airport and airline officials note the problem of delayed constructionis not confined to cosmetic alterations but also involves important safetyprojects.     "When dealing with safety and efficiency of the aviation system, itmakes no sense to have to wait," said Mr. Wigington.     A possible solution to the current budget problems has been proposed bythe Airports Council and the American Association of Airport Executives. Thelatter represents executives who manage primary, commercial service, relieverand general aviation airports in the United States. They began talks in 1994to spearhead a National Aviation Infrastructure Development Bank.     As envisioned, the congressionally established bank would be funded byexisting aviation taxes and user fees.     "Given that aviation has a good flow of revenues, we could set up anentity outside of the government process and generate sufficient capital inthe private-sector market," said Mr. Wigington.     Currently, money is put into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund(established in 1970), which is financed by taxes on passenger tickets,domestic air cargo and noncommercial aviation fuel. The fund supports 70percent of the FAA's operating expenses and also provides grants for airportsthrough the AIP. The NAIDB would take over a large part of the trust fundduties.     "It would be the sole way to fund the AIP, so that the trust fund wouldno longer pay for the AIP but be funded by this infrastructure bank," saidMr. Wigington. "The trust fund would pay for FAA operational expenses, so itwould separate the capital equipment programs and have it funded by thebank."     Supporters of the proposal stress that the bank would be created withoutan increase in user fees on shippers and passengers.     "It would be a very strong creditworthy entity because of its access toaviation revenues," said Mr. Wigington. "We would be able to generate between$14 billion and $25 billion over a 10-year period. That revenue stream wouldcome into the bank through various user fees.     "The beauty of it is that we propose keeping the fees at the same level,so there is no additional tax or fee burden...It is essentially privatizingthe funding. We would take the cargo waybill tax and leave it the way it is.The private sector can do a lot more with funding, especially because the FAAcannot go and borrow money (from the primary markets)."     Under the NAIDB plan, the bank would serve to collect fees and handleall financing, while the FAA would still make the decisions on what to buyand when. In essence, Congress would still authorize all the funding, saidMr. Wigington.     Donna McLean, a spokeswoman for House Transportation and InfrastructureCommittee's Aviation Subcommittee, said the subcommittee supports morefunding for airports but has reservations concerning the NAIDB and potentialbudget problems.     "There are a couple of problems with the bank, such as budget-scoringproblems. Basically what they are suggesting is using the user fees, and(taking money) away from the trust fund, which we believe will causeproblems," said Mrs. McLean. "I'm not convinced that the airport system needsto be borrowing money. If you look at your personal budget, you would borrowmoney to buy a house or for one-time needs.     "But when talking about the national airport system, you'll havecontinual payments. In your personal budget, you wouldn't borrow to buyfood," she said.     Mrs. McLean said that, despite the bank's potential, it probably won'tpass in Congress when it comes up for debate.     "We will continue to look at this issue during the AIP reauthorizationdiscussion. We are certainly interested in discussing new approaches tosecuring additional funding for the airports and other FAA programs. But,initially, while (the plan is) appealing, the budget problems could mean thebank proposal's downfall," said Mrs. McLean.     The AIP is also preparing for its reauthorization, come this fall, asits current two-year authorization expires. Hearings are set to begin on Feb.29 and continue until March 20 to discuss the next AIP reauthorizationperiod.     "We are not sure if this time around it will be a multiyear or a singleyear," said Victoria Pannell, vice president of public affairs for theAirports Council International. She said the AIP authorization will depend,in part, on the still-to-be-determined financial status of the FAA's new AirTraffic Control Corp.

With the recent proliferation of regional trade pacts, customs officialsfrom Canada to Chile have joined forces to begin simplifying the maze.Governments are working together to streamline paperwork and cut back on redtape, expedite cargo clearance at border crossings, harmonize rules of originand rid agencies of fraud and corruption.     For example, Canada, Mexico and the United States are poised tointroduce a prototype for standardized electronic documentation to cleargoods through customs at their borders. The Information Exchange andAutomation Working Group, a trilateral panel created under the 1994 NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement, is spearheading the project.     "The problem with our borders is not that free trade doesn't work. It'sthe fact that we don't get information on these transactions until theshipment arrives," said Robert Ehinger, director of international trade dataexchange for U.S. Customs.     Under the program, the three countries would standardize trade datagathered by customs officials to the point where cargo documentation arrivesat the border crossing before the truck or train does. This way, customsofficials would have enough information to decide whether to stop theshipment for inspection or let it move through immediately.     The procedure will apply to automotive parts, beer and liquor,electronics, fresh fruits and vegetables, lumber, newsprint, steel, textilesand apparel at two U.S.-Canada crossings and four Mexico-U.S. crossings. Theprototype was originally scheduled to be used in the field for a minimum ofsix months beginning in January, but will probably not be launched until thefall, Mr. Ehinger said.     He attributed the delay in part to the U.S. government shutdowns inrecent months, adding that the schedule depends on getting the propertechnology in place along the borders.     Officials are also working to develop a hemisphere-wide customsprocedures guide, one of the mandates trade ministers from 34 nations setlast June during a summit meeting in Denver to prepare countries for afree-trade zone spanning North, Central and South America. The ministers willmeet again in March to work toward making hemispheric integration a realityby 2005.     In early February, the Working Group on Customs Procedures and Rules ofOrigin, one of seven technical groups established during the summit, met inLa Paz, Bolivia, to start work on the guide. Group members also begandiscussing ways to simplify customs procedures, identify areas for technicalcooperation in customs operations such as computerized networks and fraudprevention as well as to develop a transparent system of rules of origin.Origin rules, which determine where a product is made or what percentage of aproduct is made in a specific country, are pertinent because countries usethem to determine the product's tariff treatment.     A U.S. customs official who was present at the meeting stressed theimportance of "understanding that we're developing things the same way andthat we're talking about the same things."     Several South American countries are following the same approach. "Withregard to customs, Mercosur is working hard to coordinate policies andbureaucratic standards," said Eva Holz, a commercial law professor at theState University of Uruguay Law School.     Ms. Holz referred to efforts among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay andUruguay, the four members of the Southern Cone Common Market customs unionknown as Mercosur, to harmonize complicated tariffs and customs regimes. Forexample, "in the past, importers and exporters had to go through customspaperwork with several different state agencies. The countries have agreed tostreamline this whereby you only have to go through customs," she said.     In addition, Brazil, which has both federal and state regulations, hasmade headway in simplifying requirements.     Ms. Holz stressed that continued economic reform, especially in Braziland Argentina, Mercosur's two largest economies, would be key to pushing thecustoms standardization process forward.     Felipe Garcia, an adviser with the National Law Center forInter-American Free Trade in Tucson, Ariz., agreed, saying that moreopen-door economic policies as well as the advent of high-tech customssystems would facilitate the development of unified codes and practices."Because of technology and other factors this area of trade policy will beeasier to harmonize and change than others," Mr. Garcia said.

END        Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR COMMERCE via NewsNetFebruary 26, 1996DUTCH AIRPORT GIVES EQUAL STATUS TO CARGO, PASSENGERS; AIMS FOR MAINPORTtatus By Bruce Barnard, AirCommerce Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News     Feb. 26--Transportation officials in the Netherlands, fearingcompetition for air cargo from other transport centers in northern Europe,have earmarked over $20 billion for improvements to Amsterdam's SchipholAirport.     Unlike most airports, Schiphol, the home base of KLM Royal DutchAirlines, gives cargo equal billing with passengers.     Schiphol got final clearance from the Dutch upper house of Parliament atthe end of November for a 33 billion-guilder ($20.5 billion) expansionincluding the construction of a fifth runway to increase the airport'scapacity to 44 million passengers and 3 million tons of freight annually by2015.     The plan includes high-speed passenger rail connections linking theairport to Brussels, Paris and Frankfurt. The government is also supporting astudy for a 220-mile-an-hour rail freight service linking Amsterdam and Parisairports via Brussels.     Schiphol has a very clear idea where it wants to be at the beginning ofthe 21st century: a mainport for Europe. The aim, according to Hans Smits,president of Schiphol, is to become "a very sophisticated hub of traffic andtransport by air, rail and road, where optimum management of supply anddemand is the main element."     Schiphol boosted its cargo business by 9.6 percent to 874,000 tons in1994 as the fourth busiest cargo center in Europe.     But that performance was eclipsed by Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport,where freight surged by 17.6 percent to 898,000 tons, and London's Heathrow,up 13.4 percent at 1.048 million tons. In fact, Paris and London easilyoutpaced Frankfurt, which remains Europe's top cargo airport but grew by only7.8 percent in 1994 to 1.402 million tons.     The small loss of overall Europe market share was a setback for anairport that regularly notched the fastest cargo growth rates in Europe inthe 1980s.     Cargo figures are carefully studied by the Dutch, where Schiphol startswith the disadvantage of a small domestic market of less than 15 millionpeople. Schiphol management, like KLM, has focused on transforming theairport into a transit point for passengers as well as freight.     Between 70 percent and 80 percent of freight passing through Schiphol isbound for other destinations in Europe. And the airport is determined it willcontinue handling this "foreign" freight. It takes less than five hours toclear cargo through Schiphol, compared with 12 to 15 hours at Paris andFrankfurt.     One of Schiphol's major assets is KLM, which has made cargo a coreactivity. The airline is among a handful of European carriers committed tothe handling of freight through the end of the century.     A substantial share of Schiphol's cargo arrives by truck from pointsacross the continent. KLM recently opened its fourth European "minihub," thisone in Zaragosa, northern Spain. It also flies in freight from Manchester,Malmo, Sweden, and Linz, Austria and has a trucking link with London.     This dedication, allied to a global surge in air freight movements,helped Schiphol to raise cargo traffic by 16.5 percent to 473,000 tons in thefirst half of 1995, nearly twice the 8.8 percent rise in passenger traffic itrealized in the same period.     Schiphol planners forecast that both intercontinental passenger andfreight traffic will increase on a small number of European hub airportsserved by an equally select breed of scheduled airlines, integrators andall-cargo carriers.     On current trends, Schiphol is likely to hold its place among theworld's busiest cargo centers well into the 21st century. There is a huge gapbetween Schiphol's fourth place in the cargo rankings and fifth-place Zurich,which handled just 337,000 tons in 1994.     But Schiphol's planners say a challenger can make its mark extremelyrapidly. Nearby Brussels, with its ample spare capacity, is an obviousthreat, particularly after Swissair, a dedicated cargo player, acquired a 49percent stake in Sabena, the Belgian national carrier based at BrusselsZaventem airport.     Schiphol isn't taking any chances. It is selling itself as adistribution point for companies and a center for information and datacommunications flows.     The airport has also forged a marketing alliance with nearby Rotterdam,the world's biggest seaport, with the appointment of a joint representativein Tokyo. The Netherlands has already been extremely successful in theJapanese market: Some 42 percent of all Japanese companies in Europe havelocated their operations in the country.     Looking ahead, Mr. Smits ponders whether Schiphol should consideralliances with other airport-based companies, to build a new mainport. "Amainport is no location, it is a major enterprise. It does not thinknationally, but internationally," he said.

The Boeing 757-200 was about a dozen miles off course when itcrashed into a mountain as it made a night approach in good weather tothe airport at Cali, Colombia, killing 160 passengers and crew. Fourpassengers and a dog survived.       The report describing the events, prepared from the airplane's30-minute cockpit voice recording and digital flight data recorder byColombian air safety investigators, with assistance from the NTSB andFAA, depicts the two-man crew as confused about the aircraft'slocation as it approached Cali from the north. It says the recordingsrevealed no evidence that the crew ran a descent checklist or anapproach procedures briefing. It says there was no evidence of amechanical problem, bad weather, bomb or missile, or failure ofpertinent ground-based navigational aids.       About 63 miles north of the airport, the crew checked in withCali Approach Control and was cleared to the Cali VOR (VHFomnidirectional radio range) near the airport and told to report whenit reached the Tulua VOR on the way. The crew acknowledged theinstruction, according to the report.       But at some point after the aircraft had already passed south ofthe Tulua VOR, the crew programmed the aircraft's flight managementsystem to fly to the Tulua VOR, the report says. The aircraft, whilecontinuing to descend, made a 90-second turn to the east, toward themountains.       "Flightcrew discussion took place during this turn regarding areturn to the centerline of the approach course," according to thereport.       The crew then reset the autopilot and the aircraft turned to thesouthwest, back toward the centerline and the airport, according tothe report.        Nine seconds before the end of the recordings, the groundproximity warning system (GPWS) sounded. The GPWS gives crew anaudible warning if the aircraft gets too close to the ground. The crewincreased engine power and pulled up two seconds after the GPWSwarning, the report says. The stick-shaker, a stall-warning, came onas the crew tried to gain altitude. The flight spoilers, extendedduring descent to increase drag, were not retracted, according to thereport.

The TRACONs at Boston Logan International, Bradley Internationalin Windsor Locks, Conn., and Manchester Airport in Manchester, N.H.,are deteriorating, the FAA says. In addition, the facilities wouldhave to be enlarged to fit new air traffic control (ATC) equipment,says Ray German, the agency's manager for the Boston ConsolidatedTRACON (BCT) project.       A single TRACON handles arriving and departing traffic withinabout 40 miles of an airport. A consolidated TRACON would serveairspace surrounding all three of the airports. The FAA hasconsolidated TRACONs in metropolitan New York City and SouthernCalifornia.       Officials in the FAA's New England region recommendedconsolidation after they began looking at the problem of agingfacilities two years ago. This year, the FAA plans to start evaluatingoperational, personnel and cost issues for possible sites for thefacility, and now is in the process of choosing a contractor to help.       The agency is also preparing a cost-benefit study to learnwhether the user benefits of consolidation, such as more direct routesfor aircraft and better management of the region's airspace, canjustify the project's cost, although such benefits are not the mainreason for consolidating the TRACONs, the FAA says. If consolidationis chosen the controller workforce likely will not be reduced, Germansays.       A decision to fund the project could take as long as a year, headds. If consolidation is chosen, the project could be completed asearly as 2002, German says.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR SAFETY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FAA QUICKENS STARS PROCUREMENT       The FAA will award the Standard Terminal Automation ReplacementSystem (STARS) development contract in April, instead of waiting untilAugust, because the three firms that passed the pre-bid operationalcapability demonstration (OCD) showed significantly more progress thanthe agency expected.       Boeing , Loral and Raytheon, along with their subcontractors,will be awarded equal value contracts to begin developing STARS, saysFAA spokesman Jeff Thal. The result of funding three separate effortsis that the FAA will end up with a more mature system, Thal says. Theamount of the contracts has not yet been determined. The early awarddate will also allow the contractors to get a jump start on softwaredevelopment, which the FAA determined from the OCD will take 20 monthsrather than 14. By October, after evaluating each company's software,the FAA will select one firm to complete development, testing, andproduction of STARS. The total value of the contract could approach $1billion.        The new equipment, to be installed starting at the end of 1998,will increase automation of air traffic control, improve weatherdisplays and provide better surveillance of airspace at more than 220civilian and military terminal radar approach controls (TRACON)nationwide.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR SAFETY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996GEORGIA TRAFFIC EXPERT TO BE NOMINATED TO NTSB       President Clinton will nominate Georgia transportation officialGeorge Black Jr. to the National Transportation Safety Board, theWhite House says.       Since 1988, Black has been director of transportation forGwinnett County, Ga., outside of Atlanta. Black oversees the county'sroad, airport, and storm water systems. He has also been a countytraffic engineer, and from 1985 to 1988 was the county's director ofengineering. He co-founded the county police department's fatalaccident investigation unit and has helped investigate more than 1,500truck and automobile accidents.

One provision of the rules, however, would offset these costs byallowing airline pilots to work longer hours. An increase in themaximum permitted flight time from eight to 10 hours for two-pilotcrews would produce savings of $1.8 billion in current dollars, theFAA estimates.       The Commuter Safety Initiative (CSI), unveiled Dec. 14, includedthree separate rules to create `one level of safety' for all airlines.The commuter rule brings all scheduled airlines operating aircraftwith 10 to 30 seats under Part 121, the rules that govern carriersoperating aircraft with more than 30 seats. The commuter rule and theair carrier training rule, which require commuters to upgrade theirtraining, are both final rules. The flight, duty, and rest time ruleis a proposed rule, which means the FAA must consider public commentsbefore finalizing it (Air Safety Week, Dec. 18, 1995,).       According to FAA calculations, the commuter rule will cause theprice of a one-way airline ticket to increase by $0.62 for carriersoperating aircraft with 10 to 19 seats and $0.30 for carriers with 20to 30 seat airplanes. The total cost to airlines of implementing therule will be $75 million in current dollars. Initial compliance costs,however, will be much higher than on-going costs. On a per airplanebasis, the cost to upgrade a 10 to 19 seat airplane will be $19,400and $21,900 for a 20 to 30 seat airplane in 1996.       The costliest provision of the flight and duty time rule appliesto the scheduling of reserve pilots who must be available to reportfor work at short notice. The proposal requires that allowable dutytime be reduced for reserves who are given less than 10 hours ofnotice. Currently, there are no additional restrictions placed on theduty time of reserve pilots. The FAA estimates that this provisionwill cost Part 121 carriers $73 million a year over the next 15 years.The requirement to count ferry flights toward flight and duty timelimits could cost Part 121 airlines flying unscheduled operations $17million a year.         Despite vociferous opposition to the CSI by Alaskan commutercarriers and air tour operators concerned about the rule's economicimpact, the FAA did not exempt them from meeting Part 121 standards,saying these operations are not sufficiently different from othercommuter operations to merit an exemption.        The proposed flight and duty time rule reduces the number of dutyhours from 16 to 14 for two-pilot crews. A duty period is the time acrew member is at work and available to fly. The maximum length of theduty period increases as the number of pilots in the crew increases.   ... Certification Regulations for Airports, Carriers and AircraftAlso Addressed       Airports. Commuter airlines still will be allowed to serveairports that have not been certified under Part 139, the rulesgoverning airports served by airplanes with more than 30 seats. Theseairports will not be required to meet the air carrier standards, sincethe FAA is prohibited by federal law from regulating airports thatserve airplanes with 30 or fewer seats. Should Congress passlegislation allowing the FAA to regulate airports serving airplaneswith 10 to 30 seats, the agency has assigned the Aviation RulemakingAdvisory Committee to recommend the requirements in Part 139 thatshould be applied to airports now serving commuter operations.       Carriers. The commuter rule creates a new part, Part 119, thatconsolidates certification, operations and maintenance requirementsfor Part 121 and Part 135 operations.       Aircraft. Starting in March, the rule requires all new typecertifications for 10- to 19-seat airplanes to meet transport categorystandards, Part 25. The existing fleet of this size aircraft cancontinue to operate under their current type certification, but mustmeet upgraded equipment and performance requirements.

The NTSB affirmed the revocation of the airman certificates of AlexButchkosky, who had appealed Administrative Law Judge William Pope'saffirmation of the FAA's revocation. The FAA revoked Butchkosky'scertificates because in 1989 he was convicted in U.S. District Courtof three offenses involving importation and distribution of marijuanaand because when applying for a medical certificate in 1990 heanswered "no" to the question of whether he had ever been convicted ofa crime. Butchkosky said he was told by a representative of theAircraft Owners and Pilots Association that convictions under appealdid not have to be reported. Pope said Butchkosky "did not honestlybelieve that he had no criminal convictions when he completed hismedical certificate." The board said it would not challenge a judge'scredibility finding unless there was evidence it was arbitrary.*  Administrator v. Larson, NTSB Order No. EA-4408, Dec. 1, 1995. TheNTSB denied the appeal of Alan Larson, an Alaska Island Air Inc. pilotwhom the FAA fined $15,000 for flying a DC-3 in September 1993 withouta qualified second-in-command, flying an aircraft that was notairworthy, and falsifying a flight log. Larson appealed to the NTSBafter Administrative Law Judge Patrick Geraghty upheld the fine butreduced it to $13,000. In his appeal to the board, Larson made threearguments. He argued, for the first time during the case, that the FAAhad no jurisdiction over most of the more than 50 flights it cited inits complaint because the DC-3 was being operated as a publicaircraft, and therefore was not subject to the Federal AviationRegulations the FAA claims Larson violated. The board discarded thatargument because Larson admitted the FAA's allegation in its complaintthat the DC-3 in question was a civil aircraft. Second, the board saidthat although the flights were paid for by the U.S. government, thatdid not necessarily mean the aircraft should have been designated apublic aircraft. Finally, the board said that even if Larson had beenflying a public aircraft, many FARs would still have applied. Becausethe civil status of the aircraft was not in dispute as the case waslitigated, the board said it had no reason to pick through theviolations after the fact to see which might have applied and whichmight have been dismissed, and how that reassessment might haveaffected the penalty the FAA assessed.*  Administrator v. Kline, NTSB Order No. EA-4409, Nov. 30, 1995. TheNTSB granted, in part, the appeal of the FAA after Administrative LawJudge William Mullins reversed part of the FAA's decision to suspendthe private pilot certificate of Forrest Kline for flying too low overa house in Rimrock, Ariz., several times in August 1994. The FAA hadsuspended Kline's certificate for 120 days, claiming he violatedFederal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Section 91.13(a) by flying his WorldWar I biplane carelessly or recklessly and FAR Section 91.119(c) byflying less that 500 feet over a house that was just off the end ofthe runway at a private airport in Rimrock. Because of the terrain atthat airport, aircraft land and depart in opposite directions, whichrequires departing aircraft to make a sharp right-hand turn aftertakeoff, according to NTSB documents. Kline appealed to the judge, whoupheld the violation of Section 91.13 but dismissed the violation ofSection 91.119, saying the right-hand turn after takeoff wasappropriate. The judge reduced the suspension to 45 days. The FAAappealed the judge's decision to the NTSB, which reinstated theviolation of Section 91.119, saying there was no reason Kline couldnot have delayed his right turn slightly to avoid flying over thehouse. The NTSB left the suspension at 45 days, arguing that the twocharges were duplicative.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR SAFETY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NTSB ACCIDENT AND INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS1U.S. AIR CARRIER INCIDENTS OR ACCIDENTS, OR OTHERACCIDENTS INVOLVING SERIOUS OR FATAL INJURIES, BEINGINVESTIGATED BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARDDATE:  11/2                          SITE:  Portland,MaineAIRCRAFT:  Boeing 737-3B7            REGIST.:  N373US (USAir)             CIRCUMSTANCES:  Struck bird during takeoff/damage to first stage fan       blades/power loss #2 engine/IMC2/N4          DEATHS:  0                           INJURIES:  0                         INVESTIGATOR:  R.

All seven aboard were killed whenthe plane crashed eight miles south of the Inuvik airstrip. The boardsaid the right engine's left-hand magneto (Bendix S6LN-1227) hadexcessive wear between the flyweight and axle pin, which led tomagneto failure and right engine failure. Investigators could find noevidence that the aircraft operator, Arctic Wings and Rotors, hadcomplied with an FAA airworthiness directive (AD-78-09-07 R3, issuedJan. 17, 1983) that called for inspection of the magnetos. Further,the board found that after the right engine failed the pilot rotatedthe rudder trim wheel in the wrong direction, which compounded the yawand roll to the right.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIR SAFETY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996RVSI WAS GRANTED A PATENT FOR ITS ID-1 ICE DETECTION SYSTEM*  New York-based RVSI was granted a patent for its ID-1 ice detectionsystem, which can be used to detect ice or snow on aircraft wings andother large surfaces.

Strengthening aircraft noise rules might have driven down thevalue of older aircraft. Many airlines have already spent large sumsto hushkit older aircraft to meet Chapter 3 requirements, which willbe mandatory as of Jan. 1, 1997.     Instead, the group's decision to retain Chapter 3 limits onaircraft noise appears to provide welcome relief for airlines.Increasing the stringency of noise rules would have impacted theMcDonnell Douglas MD-80 series and Boeing 737 series.      The absence of any change in noise rules and only a modestreduction in emissions provides comfort for used aircraft values. Butit is only superficial. Airlines will be allowed to continue operatingtheir Stage 3 equipment until well into the next century but thethreat of restriction has not passed. Over the course of the next yearit will be vital to monitor the progress of the EC in formulating non-addition rules on both noise and emissions.      The International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) Committeeon Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP/3), meeting December 5-15in Montreal, recommended that the present Annex 16, Chapter 3,relating to aircraft noise limits, be retained for the foreseeablefuture. The group also asked the ICAO's full council to accept aproposal reducing aircraft NOx levels by 15-16%.      Compared to the proposed measures, the group's decisions on noiseand emissions represent the most lenient increases that could havebeen anticipated. But rather than settling these issues, its decisionscould result in a fragmentation of policy, with regions and countriesintroducing their own measures, providing confusion rather thanclarification.     The U.S. and European Commission sought to support their owninterests, making the Montreal meeting an intensely political affair.The EC was anxious to increase limits on noise since stricter rulesmay have increased the retirement rate of older and predominantlyU.S.- manufactured aircraft, giving European manufacturers businessopportunities as airlines sought replacement aircraft. Notsurprisingly, the U.S. position in Montreal highlighted the cost ofimplementing additional noise restrictions, particularly in terms oflower aircraft values.     The lack of agreement on the retention of Chapter 3 noise levelsmay not provide the status quo that the U.S. and others had sought,however. The failure to compromise may allow both camps to pursuetheir own objectives.     The lack of any agreement on noise as opposed to a compromise,may spur Europe to pursue its own policy without having to takeaccount of supra-national recommendations. The EC can be expected topush for further non-addition rules sooner rather than later. Theprimary targets will be the MD-80 series and hushkitted aircraft whoseemissions, even after modification, are seen as falling outside theEC's minimum standards.      A 3 decibel reduction of the sideline measurement compared to thepresent Chapter 3 rules will also impact a significant number ofwidebodies unless bypass ratio engines of greater than two are onceagain exempted.      Should the EC proceed with a non-addition rule, some responsefrom the U.S. must be expected.     The lack of any ICAO recommendation on noise increases thelikelihood that airports will pursue their own individual policiesinvolving a plethora of different restrictions. The absence of"Chapter 4" may make it easier for the airframe and enginemanufacturers to produce the next series of large widebodies, but witholder aircraft being allowed to remain in service for that muchlonger, new sales may be impacted.      CAEP/3's proposal to lower NOx levels follows the 20% reductionin NOx agreed to by ICAO in the early 1990s when the EC was pressingfor a 40% cut.      The NOx proposal reflects the current level of technology andapplies to newly certificated engines as of Dec. 31, 1999 andproduction engines as of Dec. 31, 2007. The airframe/enginecombinations apparently impacted by the recommendation include the Tay650 on the Fokker 100, the PW2040 on the 757, the CFM56-5B1 and -5B2on the A321, and the PW4168 and Trent 768 on the A330. But as the cut-off point is some 11 years away, manufacturers will have ample time tointroduce the required marginal improvement in NOx emissions, althougha non-addition rule imposed by EC countries will make it difficult forthe manufacturers to plan ahead.      There remains considerable concern about the impact of aircraftemissions on the environment and with research still being undertaken,the cautious approach of ICAO seems justified.      The NOx decision was a compromise favoring the U.S. lobby, passedby a 10-4 majority. Since CAEP/3 did not agree unanimously there isevery indication that the ICAO council will reject the recommendation,thereby retaining the status quo. In the event ICAO fails to adopt therecommendation, this again will allow the EC to pursue its own policywith a non-addition rule also expected to be adopted.      Recommendations of CAEP/3 require approval by the ICAO Councilbefore they can take effect.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIRCRAFT VALUE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996BOEING RETURN TO WORK DAMPENS SURGE IN USED VALUES     The return to work by Boeing machinists last month after a 10-week strike was a relief to customers, but for owners of used aircraftthere was a measure of disappointment.      The lack of new availability was beginning to raise values forsome used aircraft by an appreciable amount. The prospect of furtherrises in used values were impacted by Boeing's announcement that itintends to increase production rates to compensate for the strike andaccommodate additional demand. Boeing has, however, instructed itssuppliers to reduce production rates to avoid oversupply ofcomponents.      By the end of the first quarter of 1996, Boeing expectsproduction to be at pre-strike levels and in the fourth quarterproduction of the 737 will increase from seven to eight and a halfunits per month. This reverses a previously announced plan to reduce737 production to five per month as of April 1996. Production of the747 will rise from two to three and a half per month also by thefourth quarter of 1996 and the 767 will increase from three and a halfto four units per month at the same time. The 777 will seen anincrease from three and a half units per month to five units in early1997. The reduction in the production of the 757 from four to threeunits will be delayed from June to September 1996. The changes inproduction are relatively modest and reflect a spate of recent orders.     China Airlines has become the latest customer for the new 737,ordering six -800s with options for an additional nine. Boeing valuesthe order and options at $750 million, or nearly $47 million peraircraft, which equates to the list price. A total of 220 orders havenow been placed for the new generation 737.

In announcing Boeing's 1995 market share results, Woodard saidAsia will become Boeing's largest market and that Boeing has the 747-500X and 747-600X under study. He declined to say which carriers aredriving the studies, but industry experts expect them to be majorAsian airlines.     On the chances for a launch in 1996, Woodard says he "would besurprised if a decision was made on that this year, but it couldhappen."     The 747-500X would have a new, larger wing, about an 8,000-milerange and the same passenger capacity as the 747-400. The -600X wouldhave the same new wing, but would be larger, carrying about 100 morepassengers than the 747-400. In high-capacity routes in Asia, a one-class configuration of the 747-600X could carry more than 660 people.      Woodard says Boeing would launch both versions as a family, ifthe market demanded it. Even with the 747 possibilities, the 737remains Boeing's bread and butter money-maker. Of 346 Boeing aircraftordered in 1995, 176 were 737s, including 129 newer -600, -700 and -800 versions. Boeing also said its 346 orders include 85 jets fromnine customers that had not been announced or that were intentions toorder.Boeing's 1995 OrdersModel     US        Non-Us    Total     Value***********************************************737       61        115       176       $6.84747       2         37         39        6.52757       9         4          13         .80767       4         22         26        2.51777       0         92         92       14.57********************************************** Total value in billions Source: Boeing "The largest market over the next 20 years will be for smalleraircraft" below 200 seats, he says. Growth versions of the best-selling 737, especially the 737-800, are putting pressure on the 757,and Boeing also is evaluating a stretch of the 757.     Boeing's 1995 market share for new aircraft orders rose to 69.7%,compared with Airbus' 14.8% and McDonnell Douglas' 9.9%. The remaining5.6% market share went to 70-seat or more jet builders, mostly BritishAerospace and Fokker. In 1994, Boeing and Airbus both had 41% of themarket. Woodard projects Boeing to have a 67% market share during thenext 20 years.     Woodard notes that Boeing won more than 90% of the 1995 ordersfrom Europe. Foreign orders accounted for 88% of Boeing's 1995 orders,and it delivered 206 jets last year, 29 fewer than expected. In the1980s, North America was the largest market, with Asia third. From1995 through 2014, Woodard says Asia will be No. 1, followed by NorthAmerica and Europe.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIRLINE FINANCIAL NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996AIRLINES SCRAMBLE WITH TICKET TAX, REFUND SCHEMES     U.S. airlines have a headache that won't go away. Lack of afederal budget resolution, which has prevented airlines fromcollecting the 10% ticket and other taxes, has airline managersscratching their heads, eyeing competitors' moves and trying to figureout how to give refunds to millions of passengers who bought ticketsin 1995 and paid taxes that airlines temporarily cannot collect.     "Anyone who had expected a quiet start to the new year has beengreatly disappointed," noted Air Transport Association spokesman ChrisChiames. Most U.S. carriers have scrambled to change and drop nearlyevery fare by 10% and begin refunding taxes to passengers withoutcreating an administrative nightmare. One fare was listed as $89.10,10% off a $99 fare.      In the meantime, as airlines looked to the Internal RevenueService for guidance, they received none. The ATA blasted the IRS lastweek for being "caught flat-footed and unable to provide guidance" onan issue that was discussed for several weeks.     The U.S. Treasury estimates that $5.9 billion in ticket, cargoand associated departure taxes were to be collected in the currentfiscal year, or about $16 million each day. Most airlines, includingAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines chose toreduce prices immediately by 10%. Southwest Airlines is a notableexception, choosing to raise fares 10% for a short-term gain.     United Airlines, which lowered fares late last week, sees winterfare sales driving ticket sales much more than tax savings. "It's tooearly to tell how the ticket tax issue will effect the market," saysUnited's Tony Molinaro. "We'll look at it mid-month." United flies200,000 people each day.     When the budget showdown ends, the fun may begin on collectingback taxes. "We believe that no excise tax can be enactedretroactively," says Chiames. "It would be impossible to collect. TheIRS would have to collect it."

Following a year-long study, Airbornechose the 767 over both the Airbus A300B4 and the McDonnell Douglas10-10.     Nine of the 12 will be acquired from Itochu Air Lease Corp.,with the remaining three from Marubeni Corp. Airborne bought the 12,plus spares and major modification to cargo configuration, for $290million.     Airborne also will acquire 10-15 more 767-200s in the next eightyears at a total cost of $310 million. The first two 767s will arrivein 1997, followed by four in '98, four in '99 and two in 2000. Themove "should decrease operating costs while keeping capitalrequirements relatively unchanged," the airline said.     The 767 has many operating advantages over other aircraft of thesame size, mostly due to newer, fuel-efficient engines and a two-person crew. Airborne figures its 767s will have a 14% lower directoperating cost per hour than the DC-8, 17% less than the A300 and 43%less than the DC-10-10.     Among the factors in Airborne's 767 decision were: to acquireaircraft that could serve markets that it is outgrowing with DC-8s;the ability to fly unrestricted payloads transcontinentally, and tofly at an aircraft utilization rate of at around 12 hours or more perday.      Airborne now operates a fleet of 63 DC-9s, 35 DC-8s and 11 YS-11s. The carrier says it has no plans to retire any aircraft as aresult of the purchase decision, and has been adding eight to 10 DC-9sand DC-8s annually and plans to continue that rate.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIRLINE FINANCIAL NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996HARRIS BRINGS START-UP PLANS TO AIR CANADA BOARD     Air Canada Chairman Hollis Harris again is expressing his desireto start a low-cost airline in the U.S., possibly when he "retires"from Air Canada late next year. In a year-end interview, Harris saidhe discussed his ideas with the Air Canada board of directors and evenfloated the idea of the airline investing in his new carrier andselling him up to 35 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s.     "I think there will be another ValuJet," he said, noting that ifhe doesn't use the DC-9s, some other start-up airline could do thesame. Harris said he told his board that the new venture would notcompete against Air Canada.     The airline's DC-9s, 11 of which are owned and 24 leased, areexpected to come out of Air Canada's fleet in 1997. The jets have anaverage age of 26 years.     A new U.S. carrier with the same equipment and roughly the samecosts as ValuJet would be formidable.     "It could easily squeeze some smaller start-ups out ofexistence," says an industry analyst, depending on which city it wouldcall home. Beginning a hub in Atlanta (ValuJet's home) or Dallas(Southwest's) would be extremely risky, pointing to a possibleinvasion of smaller low-cost carrier hubs in Denver (WesternPacific's) or Orlando (AirTran's).     Since Harris and ValuJet President Lewis Jordan live in the samesmall Georgia town - Peachtree City -and know each other well, somesort of joint DC-9 operation also could be possible. ValuJet currentlyis expanding its fleet to 43 aircraft this month, meaning an airlineoperating Air Canada's 35 DC-9s would nearly equal ValuJet in size.     Sources say Air Canada should want a stake in the new carrier,especially with its new found financial health and a desire not to leta start-up eat up its profitable U.S.-Canada routes or ruin itsmargins.     Air Canada and its regional airlines have launched or willlaunch service on 30 new routes by March, and a start-up alliance with'Air Hollis' would make it formidable into many north-south markets.Within the last few months, Air Canada began new non-stop servicebetween Canada and Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington,Houston, Las Vegas and Minneapolis.     Air Canada reported a net profit of $94 million for 1994 and $50million for the first nine months of 1995. Its 120-jet fleet includes21 new aircraft. Air Canada operates 500 daily flights, and also takesadvantage of 83 aircraft from five feeder airlines, all of which are100% owned by Air Canada.

Independence intends to obtain government approvals and beginoperations by May 1, Hagerty tells AFN in an exclusive interview.Independence had hoped to start operations last year [AFN, July 3,1995].     The new carrier will operate two Airbus A300B4s 11 hours per dayfor passenger and freight service from New York and Atlanta to LosAngeles. "We expect to offer fares 20% less than the lowestunrestricted fare, and, on average, our fares will be 50% lower thatwhat the marketplace now offers," Hagerty says. "We expect tostimulate additional cost-to-coast travel," he says, much the wayValuJet Airlines has seen local traffic jump when it enters a market.     Hagerty, former CEO of USAir Express carrier CCAIR Inc., wasresponsible for the commuter airline's fully subscribed initial publicoffering in 1989. The two million-share offering was led by MerrillLynch. Although it wasn't mandatory, Hagerty is investing inIndependence. He replaces Barry Harris, who ended a short seven-weekstint as CEO to return to his Washington, D.C. government affairsconsultancy.     Independence Air had raised $500,000 in 1995 and expects another$2.2 million by the end of the first quarter. "We expect to go publicsometime this year," he says. Most of the airline's managers, likeHagerty, have 25 years of airline experience.     Hagerty also expects Independence to make a profit as it startsoperating, since its unit and fixed costs will be low. Seat mile costsin the four cent range. Transcontinental tickets prices will be as lowas $119.     The airline has had tentative discussions to secure operatingleases for its airplane of choice - the A300 - but hasn't signed acontract. During the first phase of operation, Hagerty expects to needa minimum of eight A300s. "That's all contingent on early profits," hestresses.     Independence sees early cargo volume helping its balance sheet.The airline also has seen "a lot of interest on from freightforwarders, since we have a low-cost wide-body to offer."Back to Headline List CopyrightAIRLINE FINANCIAL NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996NORTHWEST APPROVED TO FLY FIRST NONSTOP US-CHINA SERVICE     Northwest Airlines will fly the first non-stop service from theU.S. to China, receiving authority just before the new year to flyDetroit-Beijing.     The new service will start May 1 with three flights per weekusing Boeing 747-400s. The government approval would have allowedNorthwest to start April 7 at the earliest.     The U.S. signed its 29th international aviation pact with ChinaDec. 23, which should lead to more route authority approval in thecoming months. The new nonstop service will save time and money forairlines and passengers by allowing them to bypass Tokyo, thetraditional Asian gateway to China.     The new bilateral gives Northwest nine flights per week toChina, phased in over the next two years. FedEx receives fourfrequencies immediately, and China Southern is allowed to serve theU.S., both for passenger and cargo.     Northwest, though, is the big winner, adding to its alreadyburgeoning business to Asia. Northwest's Pacific Division had a 12%profit margin for the third quarter ending Sept. 30 [AFN, Dec. 25,1995].      The airline reported in its Form 41 reports to the U.S.Department of Transportation that it had $836 million in Pacificoperating revenue, $170 million in operating income and $100 millionin net profit for the third quarter.     Northwest President and CEO John Dasburg said General Motors,Ford and Chrysler provided "valuable assistance" in lobbying for theChina rights. The airline will fly the "Great Circle" route to China,over Alaska and eastern Russia. The 6,600-mile flight will take 13hours. Northwest began service to Shanghai in 1947, reinstating it in1984; today it operates one weekly flight through Tokyo. It also fliesthrice weekly to Beijing through Tokyo.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIRLINE FINANCIAL NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996AIRBUS WINS LARGE PHILIPPINE AIRLINES ORDER     Airbus won a plum order for 24 aircraft of three types fromPhilippines Airlines, securing a long-term role with a carrier thathas exclusively operated Boeing 747s on its long-haul routes. Theorder was announced Dec. 29, bolstering a sagging Airbus orderbook for1995.     PAL ordered four A340-300s, eight A330-300s and 12 A320s.Deliveries of the first A340 and A330 will begin in the second quarterof 1997. PAL had ordered four A340-200s, the first of which will enterinto service by the end of this year.     A statement by Airbus said PAL's A320s will "become theairline's sole single-aisle aircraft type," which means the carrier's11 Boeing 737-300s - all leased - would become available. PAL has afairly new fleet of 737s, with the oldest jet manufactured in 1988.

ICAO estimates that airlines flew 2.2 trillion revenuepassenger kilometers (RPKs) in 1995, an increase of 7% over the 2.1trillion flown in 1994.     Capacity, based on available seat kilometers (ASKs), is estimatedto have risen 6% to 3.3 trillion, and average passenger load factorwas expected to rise one point to 67% worldwide. In addition, ICAOestimates 21.6 million tons of freight were transported last year, up8% over 1994. The data indicate a continuing recovery of the worldairline economy and the likelihood of record traffic growth in 1996.     Internationally, passenger traffic rose 8%, ICAO estimates, to1.2 trillion RPKs, up from the 1.1 trillion flown in 1994. Availablecapacity in ASKs will have risen slightly less than traffic growth, 7%-- totaling 1.8 trillion, meaning that average load factors oninternational routes also increased by approximately one point, to68%.

For 10 major carriers, trafficrose 1.6% over November 1995, while capacity actually decreased 0.3%.The positive trend for the 11 months through November was almost asstrong, with revenue passenger miles rising 1.3% faster than a modestboost in available seat miles.     The Alaska Air Group showed a welcome positive switch inNovember: RPMs up 13.3% versus an ASM increase of only 5.8%.

Proportionally, the two biggest gainers were a low-farestartup and a veteran major that dropped its own low-fare operation.ValuJet Airlines and Continental Airlines picked up more than 350% inshare value in 1995.     Two recovering airlines, Northwest and USAir, saw their stockprices triple last year. A mix of new and old airlines doubled shareprices, from the modest Frontier to the giant United Airlines. Moremoderate but still welcome increases were posted by American Airlines'parent AMR Corp. and Delta Air Lines.     Southwest Airlines, the big loser on 1994 stock markets,recovered 37% of its share price.     Despite lagging the high-flyers in 1994, AMR's past strengthenabled it to remain the most valuable U.S. airline franchise - atleast according to the market's guess. AMR equity was worth $5.64billion Dec. 29.     Federal Express and Delta slipped a notch in the ranking, asNorthwest's gains puts it second, at $4.30 billion. United's climbsharply in 1995, but the second largest airline in the world was stillonly seventh in U.S. market value at year-end. A late-December drop ofnearly 15% in UAL Corp. share prices did not help.     Overall, 17 publicly traded airline companies gained $13.15billion during the year, nearly doubling their market value.

The move prompted animmediate outcry from outgoing British Airways Chairman Sir ColinMarshall, who indicated that BA may take legal action against the EC.     European Commissioner of transport Neil Kinnock and SpanishIndustry Minister Juan Manuel Eguiaguaray reached agreement Dec. 14 onthe bail-out proposal. The European Union said the agreement calls forthe loan to be considered a market-compatible investment and "wouldnot therefore constitute state aid." The EU plans to make a formaldecision on the proposal in mid-January.     Marshall, an opponent of state-aid to ailing carriers, said thetranche of funds "astonished" the European airline industry. "The[European] Commission's justification seems to be that the state aidoriginally requested has somehow been miraculously transformed into aninvestment," Marshall told the Royal Aeronautical Society Dec. 14, atthe annual Wilbur and Orville Wright lecture.     "It is an amazing decision which further sets back the prospectof truly fair competition in Europe," Marshall said. "It is sad to seethe Commission give in to political pressure. I find it extremelydifficult to see how the Commission could [conclude] that this is notstate aid."     Marshall hopes the EC will distribute a report by consultantsDeloitte & Touche, commissioned by the EC to look into Iberia'sbusiness plan. "We are ... considering our response [which] couldinclude legal action against Neil Kinnock's proposal," Marshall said."The practice of state aid makes a mockery of single market practicesand weighs heavily against British airlines."     Under the EC proposal, the commission would "indicate itswillingness" to consider a request for an additional capital injectionof up to 20 billion pesetas [$164 million] in 1997 if Iberia achieves"financial and other indicators" for 1995 and 1996, which would beconfirmed by independent accountants.      The European Union estimates that on the advice of itsconsultants, "the minimum capital injection to meet immediate cashrequirements would be slightly more than 50 billion pesetas [$410million]." However, it added, "a higher capital injection could beconsidered to be feasible on commercial grounds."     The EU, in approving an 87 billion-peseta initial tranche, tookinto account annual profit growth of 4%; the cost of the new capital;and proceeds from Iberia's interest in Aerolineas Argentinas.     After the EU said last year it would not approve a bailoutwithout Iberia divesting its majority stake in Aerolineas Argentinas,Iberia parent Teneo Group negotiated a sale of the Latin Americancompany to private investors.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIRLINE FINANCIAL NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996KLM FILES SUIT AGAINST NORTHWEST CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS     KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is suing the controlling directors ofNorthwest Airlines, saying that last month's adoption of a "poisonpill" defense by Northwest was illegal and invalid. The suit says thepoison pill "was not to protect the Northwest stockholders fromhostile acquisitions, but to restrict KLM's ability" to exercise anoption it was granted two years ago to buy an additional 5% ofNorthwest stock. KLM was granted an increase in ownership after itmade an emergency loan to Northwest for $50 million and helped arrangefor $200 million more.     The complaint filed in a Delaware court seeks an order to setaside or modify the "poison pill" on the grounds that Northwest'saction was "tainted with self-interest," since it was "advocated andapproved by a majority of directors who stood to gain financially ifKLM is prevented from exercising the option."Back to Headline List WT03-B28-13IA059-000320-B034-270http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae39.html 205.156.212.5 19970114200445 text/html 32859HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:02:45 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:32 GMTContent-length: 32672Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae39.html Sample Issue Copyright AIRLINE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNet January 17, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES CONTINENTAL, TACA GROUP SIGN CODESHARING/MARKETING ALLIANCE (276 words) LUFTHANSA, SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS SIGN COOPERATIVE ALLIANCE (226 words) MALAYSIA AIR CHAIRMAN SAYS VIRGIN ATLANTIC STILL CODESHARING (201 words) TAIWANESE COMPANY PLANS PANAMANIAN AIRLINE (185 words) BUSINESS TRAVEL PRICES WILL RISE 3%-4% IN 1996, AMEX PREDICTS (365 words) DELTA TO CRS VENDORS: LOWER FEES TO REDUCE DISTRIBUTION COSTS (244 words) AER LINGUS NAMES NEW EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT (93 words) GULFSTREAM INTERNATIONAL, SANDALS RESORTS IN PARTNERSHIP (87 words) ATLANTA-BASED NEW-START INDEPENDENCE AIR GETS NEW PRESIDENT (266 words) DELTA, AMERICAN EXPRESS LAUNCH CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARD (137 words) AMERICAN UNVEILS EXPANDED CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM (122 words) FORMER KIWI EXECS FORM CONSULTING GROUP FOR START-UPS (737 words) MARKETING BRIEFS (160 words) YIELD MANAGEMENT/RESEERVATIONS (342 words) AIRLINE ADVERTISING (113 words) AIR SOUTH TO START BUSINESS-CLASS SECTION; EXPANDS TO FLORIDA (255 words) CANADIAN PLANS BUSINESS-CLASS UPGRADE IN 737 FLEET (165 words) BRITISH AIR SUBSIDIARY TO OFFER 25% INCREASE IN CLUB EUROPE SEATING (105 words) CopyrightAIRLINE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996CONTINENTAL, TACA GROUP SIGN CODESHARING/MARKETING ALLIANCE      Continental Airlines and the Taca Group of Central Americanairlines, which compete in numerous U.S.-Central American markets,will team up in a new marketing and codesharing alliance.      The pact will provide for the Taca reservations code onContinental flights between its Newark hub and Miami, Houston andDallas, as well as Houston and Los Angeles. Continental's two-lettercode will appear on selected Taca Group flights between Panama Cityand several destinations including Guayaquil, Quito and Santo Domingo.      The agreement will become effective June 1, this year, subjectto the approval of the U.S. government and El Salvador.      The Taca Group consists of Taca International Airlines,Aviateca, Copa, Lacsa and Nica.      "Central America and the northern tier of South America areimportant markets for Continental and are obviously the home marketsof the Taca Group carriers," says David Grizzle, vice president-alliance development for Continental.      "This alliance will increase the presence of Continental in eachof the markets we already serve, add some additional markets, and willimprove the Taca Group's reach into the U.S."      Grizzle says Continental will benefit from increased scheduleconvenience for passengers, improved through check-in and seatselection, and OnePass frequent flyer mileage accrual opportunities onTaca airlines. The frequent flyer cooperation is reciprocal, so Tacapassengers flying on Continental flights also will be ableto accrue Taca mileage.      What was unclear last week is if Taca customers may also accrue mileage through LatinPass, the 15-airline frequent flyer program whosechief founder is Taca Group Chairman Federico Bloch.

Tajudin was responding to reportssuggesting that Virgin Atlantic would formally request dissolution ofthe code-sharing arrangement.      Under the agreement, MAL and Virgin operate 14 weeklyfrequencies from Kuala Lumpur to London, and seven weekly frequenciesto Australia using MAL aircraft. "Mr. Branson is a gentleman.

"In fact, he is in constant contact with us.We're very happy with the (code-sharing) arrangement."      The code-sharing agreement, which came into effect last May, wasconsidered a coup by Malaysia Airlines, because it enabled the carrierto market to passengers needing to fly through London onto theEuropean continent, or the opposite way to North America.

The publication, 1996 Trends & Forecastsfor the Business Travel Industry, suggests the increase is on top of a5% increase in average fares from 1994 to 1995, suggesting a minorslowdown in price increases.    For 1995, typical business fares were estimated to have risen 3%,based on data from the first three quarters of the year.) For October,the latest full month in 1995 of actual booking data available, theaverage fare paid by business travelers rose 12% higher than October1994, based on corporate reservations booked through Amex in the 215routes tracked by its "Airfare Index" for business travel.     In addition, full-coach fares rose 3% from October to November,while the lowest discount fares fell by 1%. The lowest discount farelevel, however, is 14% higher compared to November 1994.    Discount fares will be difficult for business travelers to find,Amex says, suggesting that average full-coach fares will continue torise. Amex says load factors are forecast to reach a record high of67% by the end of 1996. "There's no relief in sight for 1996," Amexadds, "as passenger traffic is expected to outstrip supply growth,bringing fares back to nearly 1993 levels."    Electronic distribution will play a larger role in streamliningbusiness travel and reducing costs, Amex suggests. "Travel agencies,airlines and computer reservations systems providers are introducingtools this year that enable booking travel by e-mail or Internet, ordirect computer dial-up to reservations services," Amex says. "If notbooked through a corporate preferred agency, however, employees mayfind themselves paying 15% to 20% more than corporate rates.    "These tools," Amex says, "along with electronic expense reportingsoftware, are expected to reduce the administrative burden ontravelers, and streamline accounting and data management associatedwith travel."    The publication estimates that the average company spends 43% ofits travel and entertainment budget on air fares, with 21% on lodging,8% on car rentals, 25% on meals and 3% on miscellaneous expenses. Amexbelieves U.S. companies spent approximately $140 billion on travel andentertainment in 1995.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIRLINE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996DELTA TO CRS VENDORS: LOWER FEES TO REDUCE DISTRIBUTION COSTS    Delta Air Lines issued a plea to computer reservations systemvendors to help it reduce distribution costs incurred through agents'booking practices.    Since the option of electronic ticketing is rapidly becoming theindustry norm, "CRSs will be forced to offer product distribution forlower participation fees, and the more efficient CRSs will have anadvantage over other systems," says Robert Coggin, executive vicepresident-marketing for Delta.    A recent rate increase will bring Delta's CRS distribution coststo $250 million annually, the airline claims. "Continued rateincreases and other CRS marketing practices, such as productivitypricing, which encourage abuse, will only encourage Delta and othercarriers to implement practices designed to minimize or eliminate thedistribution of their product through CRSs."    Airlines have been increasingly concerned about "productivitypricing," which offers substantial bonuses to travel agents who book acertain number of segments in a given period on one airline. Thepractice, airlines claim, encourage agents to make large numbers offalse bookings.    "We are at a critical juncture in our effort to determine the mostcost-effective means of distributing our product," Coggin says. "WhileDelta has long supported CRS distribution, we cannot support aninefficient system which relies on increasing participant charges asits primary source of revenues." Coggins says that if Delta cannotreduce distribution costs "through dialogue," it will have no choicebut to find other avenues "that might be available to us." Coggin didnot say what those avenues might be.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIRLINE MARKETING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996AER LINGUS NAMES NEW EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT    Aer Lingus, last week named a new executive vice president forNorth America.

Roy Hagerty, a 25-year industry veteran,replaces Barry Harris, a former acting administrator of the FederalAviation Administration, who decided to return to his consultingbusiness in Washington after less than two months with the fledglingfirm.    It was the second such leadership change at Independence Air.Before Harris, the Department of Transportation indicated to thecompany that the appointment of Stephen Quinto, one of the airline'sfounders, would be inappropriate due to the bankruptcy of his lastairline, Northeastern, in 1982.    Hagerty, who most recently served as president of AirlineDevelopment Group, a consulting firm based in Raleigh, N.C., says thecompany needs some $6 million in startup funds to get off the ground.The company is still looking at Airbus A300B4 aircraft, which cancarry some 270 passengers depending on configuration, but also is agood cargo aircraft.    Before his job at Airline Development Group, Hagerty was chairman,president and CEO of CCAIR, Inc., a U.S. regional airline thatoperated as Piedmont Commuter and later USAir Express. Hagerty grewthe business from a money-losing effort in 1983 to a $60 million firmthat reported profits of $4 million in 1991.

Iverson and several of hiscolleagues have formed a consulting group to help startup carriers getoff the ground. Turn Key Aviation Co. was formed in response tointerest airline executives had for Iverson's Kiwi start-up blueprint,he says.    Marketing is one of the key ingredients to key success for a new-start airline, and Iverson tells Airline Marketing News that he triesto "focus people on those marketing ideas and opportunities specificto the startup environment." New-start executives waste a great dealof money, he claims, on marketing programs tailored to major airlinesthat don't apply to new entrants. "Marketing dollars are extremelyscarce for skimpily-funded airlines," he says. "Very often, there'ssuch a lack of marketing expertise with small airlines that they willrun to something that seems very sexy to the public, not realizingwhat effects it will have on them."    One of those areas is loyalty programs. Iverson warns new entrantsnot to be lured into frequent flyer alliances with major airlines thatbring with them large per-passenger expenses. "Try to take a closelook at what your non-cash resources do for you in customer loyalty,"he says. "Unfilled seats are one of those resources."    As an example, he suggests that a new-entrant carrier offer onefree roundtrip for every five roundtrips. "You reward the customer forfrequency and make it simple for the airline," Iverson says.    Iverson also advises airlines to shy away from large computerreservations systems for distribution purposes. "Our feeling is,looking at successes such as Western Pacific and ValuJet," he says,"comes very definitely down on the side of an in-house, proprietaryreservations and yield management system. I think they allowtremendous flexibility in the control of an airline's inventory."    Citing Western Pacific as one of the most successful startups toutilize good internal yield management, Iverson says, "Ourunderstanding is that they have the ability to almost instantaneouslyreallocate fares and availability to maximize yields."    An in-house system also allows an airline to much more easilymaximize revenues, and he cautioned against taking too much of asimplistic approach to pricing. "Kiwi and UltrAir thought it would bea wonderful idea for a single price, unrestricted ticketing scheme,"Iverson recalls. "What wound up happening is that they turned overtheir inventory to the major carriers, because all they [majorcarriers] had to do was lower their fares in one of their `buckets,'"a term used in the airline industry to describe a category ofrestricted fares.    "Kiwi ultimately had to approach it from a much more traditionalyield management system," Iverson says. Instead of buying an off-the-shelf system, however, Iverson says the carrier "tried to do itpiecemeal." It hired individuals with yield management expertise fromother airlines "and then tried to meld it into the Kiwi process."    It was not an easy cultural change to make, Iverson recalls, afterKiwi reservations and sales employees had become accustomed to asimplified pricing scheme. "When multi-tiered ticketing andrestrictions popped up," he says, "it was not accepted by the staff.We had to show we were losing a significant amount of money per seat.Then people started buying into it."    Advertising and external promotions also are a critical element ofshort-term success, Iverson says. He notes that ValuJet spent nearlyhalf of its startup capital of $3 million on advertising and relatedpromotions. "Southwest Airlines," he says, "spends something like 80%of its annual advertising budget for a new market in the first coupleof months of a new service." For a three-aircraft startup, hesuggested a figure of some $1 million per year.    He also advises startups to "take a non-traditional look at how toget your name out to the public." Use innovative public relations tomaximize your free publicity. Southwest, ValuJet, Air South andWestern Pacific are all good examples of innovative publicity yieldingbenefits nearly equal to that spent on advertising and salespromotions.    Sussex, New Jersey-based Turn Key says it is currently is workingwith three start-up carriers that expect to launch service this year."Our group is different from other consulting concerns in that we havearranged for sources of financing, have aircraft ready to be put on acertificate and have a marketing and public relations team that madeKiwi a household name," Iverson says.

The airline also will start new service to severalsouthern U.S. destinations, mostly in Florida.    Air South Chief Financial Officer Tom Volz says the carrier willcharge $20 extra for an "up-front club section" seat. At the sametime, it will eliminate "lounge areas" it has had on its six Boeing737s-200s. The airline has lowered costs from 14 cents per seat milewhen it first flew last year to about eight cents. It costs Air South8.3 cents per seat mile to fly a 250-mile segment, Volz says.

Air Southwill soon start non-stop service from South Carolina to Atlanta,Raleigh-Durham, Jacksonville and Myrtle Beach. New one-stops areplanned to Miami, Tallahassee and Tampa-St. Petersburg.

The first segmentof the fleet to get upgraded business class sections will be the 737s,37 of which are flown by Canadian.    The 737s will be reconfigured and outfitted with 12 widerbusiness-class seats. The new seats will replace 20 economy-classseats. In addition, the pitch between each of the 88 remaining coachseats will be lengthened by an inch, to 34 inches. Pitch for businessclass will be 39 inches.    Gregg Saretsky, vice president-passenger marketing for Canadian,says the move is partially prompted by last year's "open skies" U.S.-Canada air services agreement, which opened up transborder services toa variety of new markets and new entrants. "The bar has been raised tomaintain a superior business class on shorter-haul routes," he says.    The reconfiguration program begins Jan. 28.

The expiredtaxes are the 10% airline passenger ticket tax, the 6.25% cargo waybilltax, the $6 international departure tax and the 17.5 center-per-gallon non-commercial aviation fuel tax. A seven-year balanced budget vetoed byPresident Clinton last month would have extended the excise taxes throughSept. 30, 1996.   Without the taxes, the only significant revenue flowing into theaviation trust fund is the interest on the trust fund balance. In adiscussion with reporters last month, FAA Deputy Administrator LindaDaschle said the uncommitted balance in the trust fund could be depleted ineight or nine months if taxes do not resume. White House officials andcongressional leaders have continued to negotiate over a budget dealthroughout much of the holiday season and will resume talks this week.Since Congress already has given FAA authority to obligate funds, includingAirport Improvement Program grants, for fiscal 1996, FAA spending shouldnot be affected by the tax expiration.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAIRPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996   Vol. 13, NoDOT UPHOLDS MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF LOS ANGELES LANDING FEES   DOT late last month found 81.5% of disputed fees at Los AngelesInternational Airport reasonable, ordering a reduction in the landing feeto $1.68 from $2.06 per thousand pounds landed weight, and a refund ofapproximately $5 million to the airlines. The decision differs from theNovember recommended decision by DOT Administrative Law Judge Burton Kolkoon the issue of police department expenses. Contrary to Kolko's ruling,DOT allowed for most of the police expenses sought by the city. However,DOT kept with Kolko's decision to exclude charges sought for police workbeyond the airport's boundary.   Kolko recommended that over the course of a year, the airlines were duejust over $7 million in refunds from the airport - representing 14 cents ofthe disputed fee. Under DOT's decision, the city will have to refund orcredit airlines only nine cents per thousand pounds landed weight in feesit found to be unreasonable.   Under an existing agreement with the airlines, 29 cents of the disputedfees relating to costs for airfield land valuation are collected and placedin escrow pending litigation stemming from a June 30 DOT rates and chargesdecision. Los Angeles will adjust the landing fee to $1.97, said JohnDriscoll, executive director of the Department of Airports. Roughly $1.3million will be returned to the airlines for collected fees allocated tofire engine company costs. DOT did not prevent the city, however, fromlater making a new allocation of the fire unit's cost when it reconcilesthe airport's actual versus budgeted expenses.   DOT disagreed with Kolko's decision that police expenses should bebourne by the community, Driscoll noted. Rather, DOT said that thoseexpenses should be shared in part by the airlines and other airport revenuesources, he said. "That was a big win for all of the airports in thiscountry. Had the judge's decision prevailed, it would have been a disasterfor airports across the country," Driscoll said. "Even with today'sdecision, LAX's current landing fee is significantly lower than many otherU.S. international gateways." Driscoll said that the judge "upheld ourright to charge the airlines our legal fees in defending ourselves in theselawsuits they have brought against us and lost. As a result, not onedollar of taxpayer money will be used to pay legal costs."   "Today's decision pays lip service to the congressional mandateprohibiting cities, like Los Angeles, from diverting airport revenues topay for general public services," Air Transport Association President CarolHallett said. "We are left with no choice but to go back to Congress forthe second time in three years to get this mess cleaned up." Hallett saidthat the increased landing fees are "nothing more than hidden taxes" forLos Angeles area citizens. "The airport has nearly $1 billion in retainedearnings, and city hall projected a $50 million surplus for the currentfiscal year.

According to authority Chairman StanleyGlassey, Johnson Controls was selected from the final four firms vying forthe contract because it offered the best chance of minimizing airportoperating costs while the maximizing revenue stream (AIRPORTS, Dec. 5,1995). In its proposal, the firm agreed to pay an independent company toconduct appraisals of its performance. SJTA said a plan for automatedmaintenance, data collection and management systems as well as demonstratedaffiliations with airlines and cargo carriers were key factors to thefirm's selection.   The firm has a use and occupancy agreement at the airport set to expireMarch 31. Once final negotiations are complete, this month JohnsonControls will be awarded a five-year operations, maintenance and support-services contract to begin April 1. A $8.4 million terminal expansion toinclude the addition of a second level and passenger loading bridges alsowill be completed that month. If for some reason a final agreement withJohnson Controls is not reached, SJTA said it will begin negotiations withSerco Corp. of Gibbsboro, N.J. despite the firm's "limited and only recentexperience operating civilian airports."

The commission's green paper on "internalizingexternal costs" in the transport sector pleads for more "efficient"transport pricing - i.e. a system that reflects the "true costs" ofcongestion, noise, pollution and accidents. The document mainly focuses onroad vehicles, but also announces some measures regarding air transport.   In the first half of this year, the EC plans to propose a system of"differentiated landing charges based on noise emissions." An example ofthis approach is the introduction of differentiated port charges forsegregated ballast tankers, which are safer and more environmentallyfriendly. The commission nevertheless admitted that "complicated aspectsof extra-community competition play a role in aviation and maritimeshipping." The tax exemption for aircraft fuels, "which could lead to adistortion in transport choices," will be reviewed in the second half of1996, the commission said.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAIRPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996   Vol. 13, NoTRANSPORT CANADA STRIKES AGREEMENTS ON TORONTO, WINNIPEG AIRPORT TRANSFERS   Transport Canada last month said it had reached "common understandings"with the airport authorities set up to operate Toronto and Winnipegairports, thus setting principal financial issues surrounding the transferof the airports to local control.

The order was a major disappointment for Airbus Industrie,which had hoped Malaysia would invest in its A330 and A340 familyof widebodies. MAL currently operates eight A330s.      The airline, a Boeing customer for more than 27 years, alsotook options on three 747-400s and two 777s. Deliveries begin in1997 and continue through 2001.      Rolls Royce won the engine maker order from Malaysia, itssecond major order in Asia to power the 777. Singapore Airlineschose Rolls-Royce in December to power its 34 777s on order. Pratt& Whitney won the order for 747 engines worth $400 million to theU.S. engine maker.       Boeing says the Malaysia decision confirms that the "777 is anexcellent airplane for operations into and out of the Asia-Pacificregion," says Ron Woodard, president of Boeing Commercial AirplaneGroup.      He adds that the 747-400 has demonstrated its suitability toAsia-Pacific markets, since it enables convenient, non-stop serviceto distant destinations. Malaysia currently operates 65 Boeing jets,including 15 747s and 50 737s. Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN AVIATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996 BOEING CLAIMS MORE THAN 80% OF ASIAN AIRCRAFT ORDERS       Asia-Pacific carriers gave Boeing Commercial Aircraft 82% oftheir orders for new aircraft in 1995, a lean year for ordersacross most of the rest of the world. The manufacturer counted 346firm orders in 1995, versus 106 for Airbus and 114 for McDonnellDouglas.    Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 36% ofBoeing's orders last year, versus 13% for Airbus and 11% forDouglas.    The 226 orders for Boeing aircraft were placed by 20 Asianairlines, from giants like All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines toTaiwan's U-Land. And lessors are taking up a little of the slack inairline demand: Ansett Worldwide Aviation accounted for seven newjet orders in 1995, mostly 737-300s.    ANA and Singapore are helping Boeing into the 21st century, withbig orders for the 777 series. Asia-Pacific airlines accounted formore than two-thirds of the 1995 orders for the 777-200 and -300.     Asian airlines also helped keep the old goods moving for Boeing.Nearly half of the orders for the traditional 737-200 and 747-400were placed by carriers in the region.                                   In December, Singapore Airlines gave Boeing one of its largestorders of the year for 34 777s and a 747-400 freighter. China Airlines ordered six 737-800s with optionson nine additional aircraft in late December. Deliveries areexpected to begin in 1998 and the order is worth an estimated $750million. China Airlines' 737s will be powered by CFM56-7 engines,manufactured by CFMI, a joint venture between General Electric ofthe United States and SNECMA of France. The aircraft will be usedon regional and domestic routes.     Boeing also posted new orders from Thai Airways for two 737-400s, Korean Air for four 777-400s, Japan TransOcean for one 737-400, Asiana for three 747-400s and Japan Airlines for 16 747-400sand five 777-300s and one 767 in December.     The JAL order for 16 747-400s announced by Boeing in its monthlywrap up of orders and deliveries is not new, says JAL spokespersonMorris Simoncelli. "The 16 747s are all part of our original orderfor 50 jumbo jets placed earlier in the decade," he says.  JALdeferred delivery on a portion of order several years ago and isnow ready to come up with a delivery schedule. The airline isoperating 32 of 50 747-400s ordered and deferred delivery on theremaining 18 aircraft, he says. Delivery schedules for the 18aircraft are expected to be announced in the next few months,Simoncelli says.    Airbus Industrie launched 1996 with a surge of orders from threecustomers. Philippine Airlines had by far the largest order of thefour -- 24 aircraft, including four long-range A340-300 widebodies,8 A330-200 twin-engine widebodies, and 12 A320 narrowbody planes.BWIA International Airways, Yemenia Airways and GATX Leasing alsologged new Airbus orders.     Delivery of PAL's Airbus aircraft begin in the second quarter of1997, with nearly simultaneous delivery of the first A340 and A330.The first A320 will be delivered in the third quarter of 1997. PALhas an additional four A340s from a previous order, which will bedelivered to PAL at the end of 1996.    The airline plans to use the new A340s to develop its long-haulroute system, including new nonstops to Europe and North America,Airbus says. A330s will be used on high-density Asian services andon medium-to-long range routes as far away as the Middle East.    PAL is also expected to order eight Boeing 747-400s valued at$2.7 billion, but Boeing Commercial Airplane Group  has yet toconfirm it. GE Aircraft Engines confirmed Jan. 5 it has receivedorders totaling $700 million from PAL for the CF6-80C2 to powereight 747-400s and a mix of CF6s and CMF56s to power the Airbusaircraft.      The number of Airbus operators increased from 123 to 131 in1995.    McDonnell Douglas posted 114 orders totaling $4.3 billion in1995, a significant improvement over 1994 figures where the U.S.manufacturer logged only 23 new orders. Asian carriers Korean Air,U-Land and EVA Air placed orders for narrowbody aircraft, the MD-80and MD-90.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN AVIATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996AIRBORNE FORGES PARTNERSHIP WITH VIETNAM POST    Airborne Express  has forged a partnership with the VietnamMinistry of Postal and Telecommunications to provide express andfreight delivery domestically and to worldwide destinations. Airborne has been operating in Vietnam since the country'sliberalization in mid-1994 and has offices in Ho Chi Minh City andHanoi.      FedEx and UPS have similar arrangements with Vietnam, butAirborne is the only firm licensed to offer express, air freightand ocean freight, says Bruce Grout, vice president for Asia Pacificoperations. Airborne acts as a freight forwarder in Vietnam relyingon the lift of carriers such as Air Vietnam, Singapore Airlines,Lufthansa and Cathay Pacific to handle its cargo. To date, it hasenough capacity, but Grout sees capacity tightening as multinationalbusiness continues to grow in the region. Express products aregrowing at the fastest, he says but air freight is climbing. "[Airfreight] will just take time to grow, as it did in China."     "As a country Vietnam is not all that important [to the cargoindustry]. But it becomes very important if you are doing businessin Southeast Asia," Grout says. "We are starting to see a lot ofbusiness between Europe and Vietnam." Seventy percent of Airborne'sbusiness is intra-Asian, but the international business is growing,he says. Footware, namely its contract with Nike, is Airborne'sprimary export. Grout expects to break even in Vietnam this yearand see a profit in 1997. "But who knows?

Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN AVIATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996MALAYSIA AIRPORTS BERHAD CONSIDERS EXPANDING MARKETING EXPERTISE    Malaysia Airports Berhad (MAB) Managing Director Khairuddin binIbrahim says the company hopes to use the experience gained frommanaging Malaysia's 36-airport system to assist airports in othercountries.     The company already has a contract to manage PochentongInternational Airport in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The contract wasawarded to a new MAB subsidiary, Malaysia Airports Management andTechnical Services, via a joint venture with Aeroports de Paris.     Malaysia Airports Management and Technical Services is beingfunded through internal sources and is initially expected to consultwith Malaysian airports to improve their management operations.Eventually, says Khairuddin, the company is looking to market itsmanagement expertise to Indochina, Pacific, Southeast Asian andAfrican countries. New airport projects in Seoul and Bangkok "may betoo big for us at the moment," he adds.    A second subsidiary, dubbed Malaysia Airports Niaga (MAN), ischarged with expanding the retail revenue base, including hotels,parking and shops. Concessions at Langkawi Airport, for instance,has just been tripled to 24 locations. As concessions space becomesmore available at other Malaysian facilities, MAN will compete tomanage the concessions.    MAN is also involved in an airport supermarket at Kuala Lumpur,and is considering forming a joint venture to branch further inthat direction. Retail revenue accounted for 30-35% of MAB's totalrevenue - about $20-$23 million - in the first six months of thecurrent fiscal year. Khairuddin says he would like to see thatfigure increase to 50% over the next five years. Marketing its dutyfree expertise overseas "in the long term. . .depends on what sortof opportunities are available," Khairuddin explains.    MAN's position in the organization reveals an interestingdichotomy. "They are essentially a business organization," explainsKhairuddin, that acts as a relatively independent subsidiary andwill have to compete for all concessions opportunities at Malaysianairports. But the company also will set price controls for dutyfree and retail business to fulfill MAB's goal of making KualaLumpur International Airport-Subang "an airport with the lowest dutyfree pricing in this region."Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN AVIATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996ASIAN STOCKS OFF IN 1995; RETAIN $49 BILLION OF MARKET VALUE    Fresh competitive forces are loose in Asia-Pacific, even asworld business conditions revive and traffic grows at near a double-digit pace in the region.  Reflecting the competition, several Asianairlines lost share values on stock exchanges in 1995, in somecases substantially.    Japan's two giants, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, wereoff 7% and 3%, respectively, in yen. Japan Air System was down evenmore sharply, 15% for the year. The other major loser was ThaiAirways International, down 20% in both local and U.S. currencies.Even mighty Singapore Airlines lost slightly. Singapore's currentfinancial remain very impressive, but the dominance the carrier oncehad at efficient, low-cost operation will be challenged more broadlyby others.    This challenge is coming partly from global carriers, especiallyin the U.S. But the most intense pressure is likely to be fromother Asian airlines. Cathay Pacific strengthened its route systemin 1995 and received a nice appreciation in share values. QantasAirways got off to a decent start as a privatized airline - thecarrier's size and position make it a threat in the SoutheastPacific. And Air New Zealand, with much more experience at fullyprivate management than Qantas, is not standing still. ANZ picked upsome ground on exchanges in 1995.    The market trimmed but hardly downgraded the bright prospects ofmost Asian carriers. Even after $3.45 billion in overall sharelosses, the ten airlines surveyed by AAN retained a market value of$48.83 billion Dec. 31. That is nearly 60% more shareholder valuethan the much bigger U.S. airline industry had - and it does noteven include all Asian airlines.    Competition will continue to trim some hefty margins in Asia1996. But the basic reason for competition -- booming passenger andcargo markets -- justifies that huge equity stake.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIAN AVIATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996NEWS IN BRIEF    China Eastern Airlines ordered two visual systems for its AirbusA300-600 and McDonnell Douglas MD-82 flight simulators. Both of thenew VITAL ChromaView systems from Flight Safety International willbe installed in the fourth quarter of 1996.     All Nippon Airways chose Pratt & Whitney and International AeroEngines to power its recent orders for Boeing 777-300s and AirbusA321s. Both will begin joining the fleet in 1998. The engine orderis worth an estimated $400 million.     National Jet Systems of Adelaide, South Australia took deliveryof its first Jetstream 41 from JSX Capital Corp. National JetSystems is JSX's first customer in Australia. The airline alsooperates a fleet of 13 BAe 146s and an Avro RJ70.

Following an accord signed by thegovernments of China and the United States that allows for expanded,direct service between the two nations. One of the most importantaspects of the air services agreement is that it opens the door forcodesharing between Chinese and U.S. carriers.       Detroit-Beijing service will be operated by Northwest thrice-weekly on Boeing 747-400 aircraft. The air services agreement allowsNorthwest to boost weekly service to nine in 1998. Northwest'sShanghai service was reinstated in 1984 and today the carrieroperates to the city once weekly with one stop in Tokyo.Northwest's current thrice-weekly Beijing service was instituted in1992 and also stops in Tokyo.       Northwest has a long relationship with China. It first servedShanghai in 1947. The airline also has pilot training contracts withfive Chinese carriers -- China Southwest, China Eastern, ChinaNorthern, Xiamen and Shanghai Airlines.     The air services agreement gives China the right to begincodesharing immediately. U.S. carriers can begin codesharing threeyears from the date Chinese codesharing commences. China Eastern,Air China and China Southern among others are very anxious to see[codesharing] begin, says U.S. Department of Transportationspokesperson Pat Murphy. American Airlines  and Delta Air Lines have also expressed great interest.        "We have had discussions on a couple different levels withChinese carriers and codesharing is certainly a possibility and wewill continue to entertain those talks," says Northwest Airlinesspokesperson Doug Killian.     Delta has never served China, but flies to Taiwan and Hong Kong."We are looking at expanding codesharing to China, but we have tolook more closely at the agreement first," says Delta spokespersonTodd Clay. "We are approached on a regular basis from carriersaround the world and we are happy that the new bilateral agreementwill offer new opportunities in China. I suspect [the Chinesecarriers] have approached every carrier about codeshareopportunities," he adds.    As for American, "we haven't applied for route authority becausethe key to Asia for American is Japan. We would love beyond rightsto China from Japan, but that doesn't look like it is in the plansfor our government or the Japanese government," says AmericanAirlines spokesperson Al Becker.

The committee specified that NTSB use the extra money torelocate to new offices and for laboratory space. The amount recommendedprovides for 360 full-time employees, an increase of 16 over fiscal 1991.Aviation safety accounts for the largest portion of the funding -- $12.6million.   The Senate also suggested the same level for the essential air serviceprogram as did the House bill (H.R. 2942) (DAILY, Sept. 13). Both chambersrecommended funding the requested level of $38.6 million, which is $12million more than last year. The carrier projected to receive substantiallymore than any other is Exec Express II at an estimated annual compensationof $3.6 million.   The Senate report accompanying the bill contains several generalprovisions that are not included in the House version, or are changed fromthe House version. Aviation-related provisions: -- Direct the DOT secretaryto prepare and implement a plan for providing slots at Chicago O'HareAirport for essential air service carriers. -- Allow FAA to increase theamount of an airport improvement grant for Ames, Iowa. -- Allow for thesale of Atlantic City Airport to proceed. -- Make a technical legislativechange that allows soundproofing of public/private buildings to be paidwith airport improvement grant funds. -- Allow combination aircraft tooperate in Alaska until FAA conducts a study. -- Allow the DOT secretary toenter into a sole-source contract with the Puerto Rico Ports Authority forthe construction of an air traffic control tower. In 1991, $4 million wasappropriated for the project, which was to be arranged through a five-yearlease/purchase agreement. The administration now wants to fund theprocurement fully, which may delay other major airport improvements. Thetower and these improvements must be concurrently constructed; otherwiseline-of-sight safety may be diminished. -- Allow the FAA and NashvilleAirport to use airport improvement formula grant funds to relocate an ASR-9air traffic radar and to purchase a temporary VORTAC system. -- Direct theDOT secretary to conduct a noise impact study covering New York andConnecticut to determine ways to reduce airport noise. It will go farenough north to cover Stewart Airport in the Newburgh/Poughkeepsie area,and also will encompass the Westchester, Staten Island, Queens and Nassauareas. -- Direct the DOT secretary to issue regulations on airports'ability to conduct criminal background checks for security purposes.   House Appropriations Committee staff member Tom Kingfield last weekpredicted that if the Senate is able to get the appropriations bill to thefloor soon, the two chambers could go to conference in early October andhave a package for the President to sign by mid-October. He said aviationbenefits well in both the Senate and House funding levels, noting that theHouse recommendation of appropriating $8.9 billion for FAA is a 200%increase from just 10 years ago. The Airport Improvement Program,recommended at $1.9 billion, is up from $450 million in 1982, an increaseof 300%. Prospects for satisfactory funding of aviation programs in thenear future, however, are not looking bright. In fiscal 1994 and 1995,there will be only one cap on spending, which will be over total domesticspending, meaning competition among individual government agencies will befierce.   Kingfield, addressing the American Association of Airport Executives andAirport Operators Council International fall legislative issues conference,said airport operators are fortunate they have the passenger facilitycharge (PFC) to fall back on. They were advised, however, to break the linkthat ties the full funding of AIP with allowing the charge of PFCs,considering AIP probably will not be appropriated at the full level.Copyright 1991 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION DAILY via NewsNetSeptember 16, 1991   Vol. 305DOT is expected early this week to grant antitrust immunity for airlines toDOT is expected early this week to grant antitrust immunity for airlines todiscuss schedule adjustments at Honolulu Airport.

Airlines saidto be interested in the New York-Washington-Boston operation includeAmerican, United and USAir. American, according to sources, has offered$115 million for pieces of the operation, including gates and valuabletakeoff and landing slots. Delta paid $113 million for the Pan Am shuttleoperation, but that transaction was part of a larger deal that includedEuropean routes, a number of aircraft and an investment in a revamped PanAm.   USAir showed interest in the airline in earlier discussions, butfinancial troubles at the carrier make an acquisition of the operation orthe bulk of the assets unlikely. While United is said to have expressedinterest in the shuttle, an attempt to purchase the airline could faceJustice Department opposition because of United's strong presence in theWashington, D.C., area. The government objected to efforts by that airlineto purchase Eastern gates and slots at Washington National Airport earlierthis year. Those assets wound up being sold to Northwest.   The Trump Shuttle, although in financial trouble, has enough cash tooperate at least through the end of the month, one source told The DAILY.The carrier has been earning a steady stream of money from its charteroperations, and its revenues are up slightly, as business travel in themarket has returned after the slow summer period. But the Trumporganization and its shuttle operation still face a heavy debt burden.Trump bought the shuttle from Eastern in 1989 for $365 million and hasinvested tens of millions of dollars in refurbishing the operation's 727aircraft and fitting them with hush kits. Meanwhile, the market hascontracted drastically over the past few years, pushing revenues downsharply.   Signs were evident as early as two weeks ago that the deal might befalling apart (DAILY, Sept. 6) Northwest said it was unable to conclude anagreement with its Machinists union that would allow it to assume controlof the shuttle, but one union leader at Trump suggested that an impassewith the union might be a way for Northwest to back out of the transaction.A lack of money on the part of Northwest, stiffening competition from Deltaand the possibility of a deal with Continental, which could give Northwesta shuttle operation all are likely to have contributed to the decision topull back.   While other unions at the carrier agreed to alter their contracts to goahead with the deal, Machinists had been holding out for severalconcessions. One included a provision to put Trump workers at pay paritywith employees at Northwest, a move which would have cost Northwest morethan $10 million extra, one source said. Other conditions were that they beautomatically recognized as the collective bargaining agent of the ticketagents at Trump and that a rival union, Aircraft Mechanics FraternalAssociation, agree to step down as the representatives of mechanics atTrump, which AMFA agreed to with some conditions.   Delta took possession of the Pan Am Shuttle at the beginning of themonth. The carrier initially had some problems integrating the airline intoits operation but now says those problems have been worked out. A Deltaspokeswoman said the carrier has been running extra sections almost dailyduring the week to accommodate passengers and has established an on-timerecord so far of about 95%.Copyright 1991 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION DAILY via NewsNetSeptember 16, 1991   Vol. 305DOT ASKS CARRIERS FOR INTEREST IN GREECE-PARIS BEFORE DESIGNATING UNITEDUnited has notified DOT it holds the requisite operating authority toprovide service between Paris and Greece and has asked the department tonotify the Greek government that it plans to exercise its fifth-freedomtraffic rights.

Speicher said United has informedthe government of Singapore that the airline is considering flying to otherdestinations in the region -- such as Malaysia and Indonesia -- fromSingapore. Carrier currently operates three flights a day from Singaporeand has just won approval from the government of Singapore to build an8,000-square-foot passenger lounge at Changi Airport. Speicher said Unitedwould not have made the type of financial commitment it has made inSingapore if it did not intend to grow at Changi. United's primaryAsia/Pacific region hub is Tokyo, and it has smaller hub operations atSeoul and Taipei.    In 1990, Pacific division traffic growth accounted for much ofUnited's full-year increase in systemwide revenue passenger miles. But1991 has been a different story. Through the first eight months this year,United's Pacific division traffic was down 3.5% from a year ago. Largepart of the problem has been the slow recovery of traffic from Japan sincethe end of the Gulf War. Japanese traffic did not return to even 1990levels until last month, and Speicher said traffic in the market willprobably remain flat, compared to 1990, for the rest of this year. Hedescribed the Japanese market as the cornerstone of United's Pacificdivision.   Decline in United's Pacific RPMs also can be traced to the carrier'srelatively small growth for the year. Through the first eight months thisyear, its Pacific division capacity increased only 4.5% from year- agolevels, which is nearly 12 percentage points below the carrier's plan forthe year. Speicher said the airline had planned to increase its Pacificcapacity 16% this year, but when the year is over, the gain will probablybe only 4% over 1990. United's traffic also has been diluted by an increasein overall available capacity in the Asia/Pacific region. Speicher saidcapacity in the area is finally beginning to catch up with demand. United'sPacific plans for 1992 do not include any new routes, but the carrier doesplan to switch existing aircraft for 747-400s on some routes. Overall,United expects its Pacific capacity to increase 8%-10% next year.Copyright 1991 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION DAILY via NewsNetSeptember 16, 1991   Vol. 305AMERICA WEST, NORTHWEST SIGN STANDSTILL AGREEMENTAmerica West has signed a standstill agreement with Northwest thatprecludes any merger or takeover activity between the two airlines for theduration of their 10-year marketing alliance.

Agreement, however, contains an escape clause releasingNorthwest from the terms of the pact should a third party attempt a hostiletakeover of America West. Also, the pact will not affect Northwest'stwo-year option to acquire America West's Honolulu- Nagoya route or AmericaWest's two-year put option, which would require Northwest to buy the routeif requested to do so by America West.   "This standstill agreement reaffirms both our intentions and those ofNorthwest that the marketing alliance is not a prelude to any change ofcontrol," said Michael Conway, president ofAmerica West, who adds the titleof chief executive this week. "We entered into the agreement based on ourconviction that both airlines would benefit by working together asindependent carriers, and nothing has occurred to alter that view," hesaid.

Rejected, however, was a similar proposal for cabincrew members. European Commission was empowered to develop regulationsleading to pan- European license, and expected to complete development ofthese common rules by the end of 1992. The French, who have stricterstandards for flight attendants than other EEC nations, objected toincluding cabin crews in the initial phase of the changeover to a commonEuropean license.   In another major development, the ministers agreed to incorporate JointAirworthiness Requirements (JARs) into European Community law, making theirapplication mandatory throughout the EEC. Decision came only after heateddebate between the Commission and ministers from member states overprocedures to be used before the technical rules could be adopted into EEClaw.   The Commission, composed of independent civil servants, sought soleauthorisation to transcribe the JARs into Community law after simpleconsultation with a committee of experts. The transport ministers wantedthe last word on the adoption of all standards, and they rejected theCommission view that the debates would be extended by presenting every JARto ministers who would have the interests of their own countries in mind.   Final agreement calls for a regulatory committee of experts from memberstates to assist the Commission. The committee must first adopt each newmeasure before it can be incorporated into EEC law.   Also at the meeting, the ministers took up the thorny issue of waiversto noise rules after Greece complained the phaseout of some Chapter 2aircraft as early as 1995 would be too expensive for Olympic Airways.Olympic is looking for a temporary exemption for its Boeing 737-200s.   A similar exemption is being considered for Third World countryairlines. The Commission staff is developing a list of these airlines andtheir aircraft, with the issue to be raised again at the Dec. 16-17transport ministers' meeting.   The ministers failed to adopt a proposal that would have extended theCommunity's transport regulations to Sweden and Norway, a decision that isunlikely to mean any radical change for SAS. That airline, because of theinvolvement in its structure of Denmark, a Community member, already wasfollowing Community rules.   Agreement, which was to formalise the arrangement for SAS, was rejectedon procedural grounds, and will be raised again at a forthcoming meeting ofthe ministers.   SAS is supporting extension of EEC rules to Sweden and Norway, seeingthis action as a means to obtain further marketing opportunities in theface of stiffening competition from Community airlines.Copyright 1991 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION EUROPE via NewsNetOctober 8, 1991AIRLINE EXECUTIVES ATTACK COMPETITION POLICY,URGE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON ATC   European airline chief executives, describing the European Commission'sstand on competition between Community carriers as "ideological," haveattacked it claiming attempts to create more competition were misguided anddamaging to the industry.   Led by Air France's Bernard Attali, the heads of five members of theAssociation of European Airlines (AEA) told Competition Commissioner SirLeon Brittan, and Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert, in a "frankexchange" that their attempts to create more competition ignored theeconomics of the airline business.   European airlines are worried the Commissions competition watchdogs aresubjecting routes where only two carriers operate to increased scrutiny.The presumption appears to be that only two carriers operating on a routeis suspicious and the situation should be looked at.   Joining Attali were the chief executives of Alitalia, Lufthansa, KLM andSwissair, who also called for urgentaction to reform Europe's inefficientand often cash-starved air traffic control system, run by individualcountries. Air traffic problems are a major source of airline delays.   Disagreement with the Commission on the competition issue comes as theEC is asking for an increase in its powers to oversee airline competition.EC has asked member governments for approval to examine competition onroutes within countries in the 12-nation Community and routes betweenCommunity and third countries.   Major airlines are worried by a commission proposal on slot allocation,designed at encouraging new entrants at congested European airports, apartfrom Amsterdam's Schiphol, by taking slots from large operators andredistributing them.   Brittan and Van Miert "do not seem to understand that some routes cannotsupport more than two operators. If you added a third, all three would berunning at a loss," said an AEA spokeswoman.   Attali told Commissioners their polices were injecting uncertainty intothe airline industry when companies needed to plan years ahead on airlineorders and strategy.   Commission plans also were attacked as shortsighted since they only takeinto account competition between airlines and ignore the fact airlinescompete with cars and Europe's fast developing high-speed train network.   On the air traffic control problem, the executives, according to the AEAspokeswoman, said "We are creating a Europe without borders on the groundbut they still exist in the air."   Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert last month called forEurocontrol's powers to be boosted as a means of creating a unifiedEuropean air traffic control unit.Copyright 1991 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION EUROPE via NewsNetOctober 8, 1991AIR FRANCE SUMMONED BY GOVERNMENT TO EXPLAIN PENDING JOB CUTSCresson and Attali in Private Talks   Air France's plan to cut its workforce by 3,000 by the end of 1993 hascome under government scrutiny, with the carrier's president, BernardAttali, being summoned to see Prime Minister Edith Cresson to explain theactions of the state-controlled company.   The Cresson government is angered that a series of state-run companies,including Air France and auto maker Renault, have announced plans to cuttheir work forces when French unemployment is above the average of itsEuropean Community neighbors and shows no sign of falling. Cresson told theFrench Parliament that state-run companies should only announce layoffsafter consultations with the unions, the government and the EmploymentMinistry.   Air France has refused to comment on the meeting or on whether its plansto save 1.5 billion French francs a year would change. Most of theemployment cutbacks are expected to come through attrition and voluntaryearly retirement.   Cresson is reported to have shocked executives of state-run companies bysuggesting they cut their pay in proportion to the cuts in staff. Head ofAerospatiale is said to have asked for a raise because he is taking on moreworkers.Copyright 1991 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION EUROPE via NewsNetOctober 8, 1991SABENA TAKES A BACKSEAT AS BELGIAN GOVERNMENT COLLAPSE   Future of Belgian airline Sabena has taken a backseat as the governmentwavered and finally resigned Friday.

TEA, which is operating under the Belgian equivalent of Chapter 11bankruptcy, is in desperate need of cash to meet its debts. Sale ofSunsnacks to Neckermann, the Belgian tour subsidiary of Europe's fourthlargest tour operator, Frankfurt-based NUR Touristic, came as TEA's U.K.subsidiary ceased operations.   Charter carrier TEA U.K. ceased operations when Manchester Airportofficials impounded one of its five Boeing 737s for non-payment of landingfees. TEA U.K. operated from Manchester, London Gatwick and East Midlandsairports.

Loss for the full year should amountto 35 million pounds sterling, compared with 38.8 million pounds sterlingin 1990.   Turnover for the first half of 1991 amounted to 139.2 million poundssterling, down 19% from last year's 171.2 million pounds sterling.   David James, chairman of Davies and Newman, said the share issue will beused to purchase 20 737 aircraft over the next four years, and toinaugurate 11 new routes. Carrier will not increase the size of its 38-airplane fleet, but will replace older 727s and BAC-111s with newer 300-and 400-series 737s.   Earlier this year, Dan-Air applied to the U.K. Civil Aviation Authorityfor 11 route licenses to complete its European network.

According to IATA, the tax would apply to alltravelers leaving the country using tickets purchased locally. Scheduledairline passengers would pay roughly $37 per departure and charterpassengers would pay $49 if the tax proposal is adopted by the FinnishParliament and the country's president.   "This proposed tax on travel is just a rip-off," charged IATA DirectorGeneral Guenter Eser. "It does nothing for the passenger and the Finnishgovernment has the nerve to expect the airlines and agents to collect themoney," he said. "This taxation is going on all over the world and, sooneror later, the consumers are going to decide that they have had enough."Copyright 1991 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION EUROPE via NewsNetOctober 8, 1991FINNAIR BEGINS TALKS WITH LUFTHANSA AS IT LEAVES QUALITY ALLIANCE   Finnair and Germany's Lufthansa announced the start of partnershipnegotiations after Finnair withdrew from the European Quality Alliance(EQA) partnership with SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.   A Finnair spokesman said talks with Lufthansa could center on revivingjoint flight agreements that ended in the 1980s. He pointed out that bothFinnair and Lufthansa were actively extending their networks to the Balticstates and Eastern Europe.   Negotiations, which start immediately, will aim to have some agreementsin place for the start of summer 1992's timetable.   A deal between Finnair and Lufthansa would appear to make commercialsense. Finnair flies to five destinations in Germany, more than to anyother country. Lufthansa recently stepped up flights to Finland andannounced new services to Latvia starting November.   Lufthansa for its part said the companies would increase cooperation inboth the freight and passenger sectors. Links might extend to catering andtechnology, it added. The Finnair withdrawal from the EQA was a bid forindependence as the other companies decided to enter into even closercooperation.   The closer cooperation, agreed in Vienna on September 30, will focus onmarketing and sales,a joint traffic system and product cooperation. It willstop short of mergers between the three remaining EQA airlines.   The cooperation will cut costs and increase the companies' market share,the partners said. Finnair will negotiate bilaterally with the EQA partnersabout existing agreements. The hourly shuttle service between Helsinki andStockholm will continue. The EQA partnership was already close before theVienna decision. Partners share office space, handle each other's airportservices and exchange cockpit crews.

Traffic also declined, showing a 9.9% decrease between January and June1991 compared with last year. Most pronounced drop, 11%, was ininternational traffic, while domestic traffic was off 7.4%.

Air Crash Near Roselawn,IN, No. 1070 (J.P.M.L.); No. 95 C 4593 (ND IL).     The FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining U.S. courtjurisdiction over a foreign state.     American Eagle Flight 4184 from Indianapolis to Chicagocrashed on Oct. 31, 1994.  All 64 passengers and four crewmembers were killed.  Twenty-one suits were filed in Cook CountyCircuit Court and removed to the U.S. District Court for theNorthern District of Illinois by defendant Avions de Transport,Regional, G.I.E. (ATR), the manufacturers of the ATR-72-210aircraft.  Plaintiffs then moved to remand the cases to statecourt.     Plaintiffs argued that the FSIA did not apply because ATRwas not an agency of a foreign government, but rather a privatecorporation in which the governments of France and Italy have aninterest.  ATR countered that the interests of the two countries,when "pooled," are sufficient to meet FSIA requirements.     Judge Castillo held, "There is simply no sound policyjustification for reading the FSIA to apply to an entity majorityowned by one foreign state but not to apply to an entity majorityowned by two or more foreign states.  The sensitive concernsraised by a federal court's exercise of jurisdiction over aforeign sovereign are no less implicated in the latter context.Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs' argument that pooling isimpermissible."     The judge next considered the "tiering" of ownershipinterests, noting that the two governments owned ATR throughintermediate corporate entities.  "Because we find that an entitythat is majority owned by an agency or instrumentality of aforeign state meets the definition of a foreign state under theFSIA, we further find that tiering of ownership interests isperfectly permissible for purposes of determining whether anentity is entitled to foreign state status under the Act," JudgeCastillo ruled.     "Contrary to plaintiffs' contentions, we do not believe thatpermitting both pooling and tiering, as we do in the presentcase, so far removes the foreign state from the entity named asthe defendant as to unduly expand the scope of the FSIA beyondthat contemplated by Congress."     Judge Castillo then held that in actions where the foreignstate is a third-party defendant, it may properly remove theentire action, including the underlying action against non-ATRdefendants, to the federal court.     The judge also ruled that the FSIA, under which the foreignstate is subject to a bench trial only, does not violate theSeventh Amendment by conferring jury-immunity on a corporationowned by  foreign states, and that plaintiffs are entitled tojury trials on claims against the non-foreign state defendants.     Judge Castillo said he will consider certification of theruling for interlocutory appeal to the Seventh Circuit U.S. Courtof Appeals.     Plaintiffs' liaison counsel is Kevin M.

Members of the International Air Transport Association(IATA) agreed to lift the Warsaw cap on Oct. 31, 1995, butalthough 22 overseas airlines have signed the IATA agreement,American and other U.S. carriers have not yet done so.  Thoseairlines are attempting to work out a detailed agreement butnothing has been finalized.  They must also receive approval fromthe U.S. Department of Transportation.     The Convention caps compensatory damages unless plaintiffsprove willful misconduct on the part of the defendant airline, asin the Pan Am Lockerbie cases and the Korean Air Lines Disastercases involving the 1983 shootdown of a KAL jet by the SovietUnion.     Claims against American are being handled by Robert L.Alpert of International Claims & Litigation Management Group,Inc.  American Airlines officials would not comment on thematter.     Lee S. Kreindler of Kreindler & Kreindler in New York City,the lead plaintiff attorney in Lockerbie who expects his firm tobe involved in the Cali crash litigation, said American risks badpublicity if it seeks to keep damages under the Warsaw limitafter agreeing in principle to lift the cap.  Kreindler told theNational Law Journal that American most likely will offer moneyin excess of the limit.     "The Cali accident has to be evaluated as a Warsaw case inwhich the passengers will have to prove willful misconduct to getrealistic damages," Kreindler said.  "If it turns out thatAmerican either breaks with other American carriers or Alpertsays, 'I tear up the Warsaw Convention,' then we may bepleasantly surprised."Back to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996SHIPPERS SAY FEE AWARDAGAINST CARGO AIRLINENOT A FEDERAL MATTER     In an opposition brief filed Oct. 19 with the U.S. SupremeCourt, Georgia Pacific Corp. and BTL Specialty Resins Corp.contend that attorney fees imposed against petitioner BurlingtonAir Express in a lost cargo case were awarded under a Georgiastatute and not federal law, making Burlington's argumentsinappropriate for U.S. Supreme Court review.  Burlington AirExpress, Inc. v. Georgia Pacific Corp. et al., No. 95-560 (U.S.);see Aviation LR, Dec. 26, 1995.     Burlington contends that cargo airlines are not subject tothe Interstate Commerce Act and have been placed outside thejurisdiction of any regulatory commission or agency by theAirline Deregulation Act.     Georgia Pacific and BTL (respondents) say the state courtaward was based on evidence of bad faith and "stubbornlitigiousness" associated with their insurance claim on the lostcargo, under a Georgia litigation expense statute.  That judgmentwas ancillary to, but independent of, the underlying claim, therespondents argue.  "The Georgia courts did not award Respondentstheir attorney's fees and expenses under the Interstate CommerceAct, the Airline Deregulation Act, federal common law, or anyother federal authority," the brief states.     "A review of the Georgia decisions discusses the appropriatefederal law to apply to Respondents' claims, and Petitioner'sdefenses, only on the insured values of the lost shipments.  IfPetitioner had wanted a clarification of the law on a claimagainst an air carrier for lost shipments, the making of aninterpretation of shipping contracts, the limitation of tariffs,and other defenses associated with air cargo carriers, Petitionershould have sought certiorari on the appropriate judgment."     Respondents contend, "There is no federal questionpresented.  If Petitioner does not like Georgia law, it shouldtake care not to act in bad faith, or it should not do businessin Georgia."     In affirming the fee award, the Georgia Court of Appealsheld, "Although deregulation took Air Cargo Carriers outside thejurisdiction of any regulatory commission or agency, the body oflaws and principles expressed in the [Interstate Commerce] Actcontinues to be applicable to air carriers as Federal CommonLaw."     In petitioning for Supreme Court review, Burlington contendsthat the Georgia ruling essentially renders the AirlineDeregulation Act void in that state.  "Moreover," the carrierargues, "this interpretation gives a preference to shippers inGeorgia by allowing attorney fees which are not available toshippers in other states.  This is contrary to all of the AirlineDeregulation Act provisions and purposes."     Respondents are represented by Everett W. Gee III of Parker,Johnson, Cook & Dunlevie in Atlanta.

Federal Aviation Administration v.National Transportation Safety Board et al., No. 94-1428(DC Cir.); see Aviation LR, Dec. 26, 1995.     The FAA charged that Rolund, flying for Wings West Airlines,used Visual Flight Rules (VFR) when visibility was less thanthree miles, and descended to 2,100 feet despite being ordered bya controller to stay at 2,500.     The NTSB reversed the suspension order, and the FAA'spetition for reconsideration was denied.     The DC Circuit affirmed, holding that the FAA clearly failedto articulate its own interpretation of the rules while arguing "for the first time " that the NTSB should defer to thatinterpretation.  A reasonable Board might also conclude, thepanel held, that the FAA had not shown that ground visibility wasless than three miles when Rolund took off.  The appeals courtalso cited evidence supporting the pilot's assertion that he didnot hear the altitude instruction.     Rolund now seeks $26,503 in attorneys' fees from the FAAunder the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA).  Under 28 U.S.C.Section 2412, a prevailing party may be awarded fees and expensesunless the position of the United States was substantiallyjustified or special circumstances make an award unjust.     The FAA said it was substantially justified in seekingreview of the NTSB decision.  "The Board did not explicitlyreject as arbitrary or capricious the interpretation of theregulations advanced by the FAA and affirmed by the ALJ at thehearing; rather, the Board applied its own novel interpretationof the regulations to the facts of the case.  The FAA tookexception, arguing that the Board's approach was inconsistentwith precedent and contrary to aviation safety," the FAA argued.     "Accordingly, the FAA argued before this Court that theBoard erred in failing to defer to the FAA's interpretation ofthe FAA safety regulations involved in the case."     The FAA also said it was substantially justified inbelieving that its interpretation of the regulations had beenraised before the NTSB.  Concerning the visibility at takeoff,the FAA noted that its objection was to the Board's "novelregulatory interpretation" that the official weather report wasnot controlling as to ground visibility.     "Accordingly," the brief stated, "the FAA was substantiallyjustified in advancing to this Court that the Board erred when itfailed to defer to the FAA's reasonable interpretation of theregulation, as required by Board case law and 49 U.S.C. Section44709(d)(3)."     On the altitude change violation, the FAA argued that it wasadvancing a long-standing interpretation of the applicable rule,adopted through Board adjudication, which on its face requiresairmen to comply with a controller's instructions except inemergency situations.  "The defense of 'I did not hear it' wasunacceptable in the absence of some reasonable explanation forthe communication not being 'hearable,' such as radio failure,"the FAA contended.     The FAA also said Rolund is seeking an unreasonable amountof fees.     Rolund claimed that the FAA's appeal was fatally flawed fromthe outset, raising issues for the first time on appeal that theagency had failed to consider in prior proceedings.  "It would bedifficult to conjure a more blatant abuse by the FAA of its dutyto consider the justification for its case.  This is exactly thetype of abuse which Congress intended to prevent by enacting theEAJA," Rolund's fee application stated.     The FAA is represented by Allan H. Horowitz and Clarence C.Butcher Jr. of the FAA in Washington, DC.  Rolund is representedby Mark T. McDermott and Peter J. Wiernicki of Joseph, Gajarsa,McDermott & Reiner in Washington, DC.

A secondrevocation order was issued in 1994 because Manin falselycertified the lack of convictions on his 1992 and 1993applications.     The National Transportation Safety Board affirmed the FAArevocation and denied reconsideration.     The Sixth Circuit affirmed, finding the NTSB decisionsupported by substantial evidence that Manin had been federallyconvicted before applying for his 1992 and 1993 certificates.The panel also noted that Manin failed to perfect a timely appealof the 1991 revocation.Back to Headline List WT03-B28-19IA059-000320-B035-213http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae30.html 205.156.212.5 19970114201144 text/html 261731HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:08:58 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:28 GMTContent-length: 261543Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae30.html Sample Issue Copyright AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNet January 1, 1996 Vol. 144, N SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES HEADLINE NEWS JAPAN BEGINS F-2 PRODUCTION IN $246-BILLION BUDGET PLAN (899 words) NASA COUNTERS RUSSIAN PLAN TO CUT STATION COSTS (696 words) BOEING MOVES AHEAD WITH SEA LAUNCH VENTURE (621 words) RADARSAT DELIVERS FIRST SAR IMAGE (300 words) ATLAS SETS RECORD (231 words) MILSTAR COMPLETES FIRST CROSS-LINK TRANSMISSION (271 words) EUROPEAN AIRFRAMERS MERGE TO BUILD MUSCLE Aerospatiale, Alenia and British Aerospace forming Aero International Regional to position themselves for the future in an overcrowded regional aircraft market (1145 words) NEW RUSSIAN MIGS SET FOR FLIGHT TEST (1238 words) FIRST FLIGHT OF C-130J DELAYED (368 words) AGM-130 SEEKER TESTED (404 words) ALCATEL PICKS MATRA FOR WORLDSPACE SATELLITE (725 words) USAF STEPS UP PACE OF BOSNIA AIRLIFT (479 words) F-16S UPGRADED FOR BOSNIA CAS ROLE (455 words) CROATS PONDER EARLY PUSH INTO EASTERN SLAVONIA (1186 words) ROUGH BALKAN TERRAIN FORCES CHANGE IN JOINT-STARS' TACTICS (812 words) ELECTRONIC TAGS TO TRACK CARGO BOUND FOR BOSNIA (545 words) AIR TRANSPORT ALASKAN AIR SAFETY OVERHAUL URGED (699 words) TRAMCO HELPS AMERICA WEST (192 words) TWA BEGINS RECOVERY, BUT REMAINS UNPROVEN (853 words) MD-83 TREE STRIKE SPARKS NTSB PROBE (1172 words) CRASH TRIGGERS REVIEW OF AMR FAA launches inquiry as NTSB weighs review of training at American, Eagle carriers (937 words) 747 SKID PROBED (312 words) BOEING TO EXPAND 737 `ROLLS' PROGRAM (645 words) PRODUCTION EXPANSION HERALDS MARKET UPTURN (335 words) JAS GETS MD-90 (93 words) PRIVACY ISSUES FRAME PILOT RECORDS DEBATE (440 words) IATA'S AVIATION ENGLISH COURSE COMES TO CHINA (446 words) DELTA, LOCKHEED MARTIN PURSUE JOINT L-1011 WORK (776 words) NEWS BREAKS THAAD TEST FAILURE LINKED TO SOFTWARE ERROR (185 words) FIRST FLIGHT FOR HONDA ENGINE (172 words) PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON vetoed the $265-billion Fiscal 1996 defense (103 words) THE PLANNED LAUNCH of the first Ariane 5 has slipped about three weeks to (56 words) PHILIPPINE AIRLINES has said it plans to order $4 billion in new aircraft (47 words) THE ECHOSTAR-I direct broadcast satellite was successfully placed in (56 words) SWITZERLAND'S DEFENSE AGENCY will procure four ADS 95 Ranger unmanned (75 words) ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS has shifted its engine choice for the 10 Airbus A321s (93 words) AIRBUS INDUSTRIE'S 185-SEAT A321 twinjet transport obtained FAA (50 words) SCHEDULED AIRLINES WORLDWIDE carried more than 1.2-million passengers and (64 words) THE WORLD HEALTH Organization and ICAO are calling for a complete ban (62 words) GLOBALSTAR HAS SECURED $250 million in new bank financing, bringing the (80 words) THE FIRST PRODUCTION McDonnell Douglas MD 600N helicopter has made its (57 words) MCDONNELL DOUGLAS has signed a contract with Motorola's Satellite (76 words) EUROPEAN NH-90 HELICOPTER ENTERS FLIGHT TESTS (129 words) 9,000 PILOTS HIRED IN `95 (238 words) RUSSIA LAUNCHES U.S. MILITARY RESEARCH SATELLITE (170 words) AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING C-17S FLY LONG-RANGE AIR DROP MISSION (330 words) F/A-18 DROP MODEL TESTS TO BEGIN (934 words) DEFENDER CERTIFIED (104 words) S-76BS TO THE RESCUE IN JAPAN (457 words) INDUSTRY OUTLOOK MESA MARKETS AGGRESSIVELY (112 words) JOINT MILITARY MAINTENANCE IN ASIA (80 words) CRM FOR ONE (89 words) EMC = SMARTER MACHINES (104 words) LASERS HIGH AND LOW (117 words) NEW FASTENER (118 words) AIRLINE OUTLOOK A340 BREAKTHROUGH (147 words) GE90 INCREASED CLEARANCES (91 words) JAPAN OPTS FOR TCAS OPS (79 words) KLM STAKE (85 words) ON/OFF SWITCH (104 words) REDUCING INJURIES (109 words) GOLFER FERRY (65 words) WHO'S WHERE KAMAN CORP.

The cutbacks include a reduction in the total purchase of FS-X fightersfrom the 141 recently sought by the air force to the 130 originallyplanned.   A close air support fighter based on the Lockheed Martin F-16C/D, theFS-X has officially left the experimental stage and has been renamed theF-2. It will replace the Mitsubishi F-1.   THE AIR FORCE APPEARS to have staved off calls for F-2 productionnumbers to drop as low as 80 to reflect a reduced threat in the post-ColdWar era. As part of its lobbying effort, the service pumped up its requestby 11 aircraft, ostensibly to benefit the Blue Impulse acrobatic team andreserve forces. But the addition was padding, in part to make projectedunit costs look better. The first 12 production aircraft are expected to befunded in fiscal 1996 and will cost about $120 million each. A fullprocurement will reduce that number to about $80 million each.   The F-2 flew for the first time in October. An entry into service is setfor 1999.   The F-2 cutback was expected. A more interesting casualty was the airforce's proposal to introduce Japan's first airborne refueling and trooptransport aircraft, which would have given the Japanese the potential toextend their air power for greater involvement in internationalpeacekeeping efforts.   That proposal has been tabled, for the time being, but may be taken upagain in three years during a midterm review of the five-year defenseplan.   The air force has tried for years to acquire tankers to extend the rangeof its fighters for interdiction missions. But political constraints,particularly from the Socialist and Communists parties, have blocked thepurchases out of concern that Asian nations would fear a resurgence ofJapanese nationalist aggression. The Socialists' objections, plus theFinance Ministry's opposition because of the program's costs, have againprevailed.   Another casualty was a Defense Agency request for an advanced technologyfighter demonstrator. Lack of funds has reduced that effort to powerplantstudies. The JDA expects to revive the effort in the 2001-2005 budgetplan.   The new force buildup is part of Japan's first rewrite of its militarystrategy in 19 years. The new policy advocates smaller forces but saysJapan must help assure stability in East Asia. It also describes militaryassistance in rescue missions, natural disaster relief and anti-terrorismcampaigns.   The new plan does not call for additional Lockheed/Kawasaki P-3Cantisubmarine patrol aircraft. Instead, a replacement will be sought.Besides an ASW role, the new aircraft is to have a capability for surfacetracking of ships as the navy picks up more roles traditionally reservedfor civilian authorities (in this case, smuggling and illegalimmigration).   The P-3C multitask replacement aircraft is expected to be introducedafter the turn of the century.   Left unmentioned is a replacement for the Mitsubishi T-2 trainer, a Mach1.6 aircraft from which the F-1 was derived. The T-2's design service lifeis nearly over. Between 1969 and 1986, Mitsubishi built 96 T-2s.   The five-year plan calls for installation of advanced phased-arrayradars built by Mitsubishi Electric for the F-15J. The same radar is to beused in the F-2.   At the navy's request, ShinMaywa is planning an improved US-1A amphibiansearch-and-rescue aircraft with higher thrust engines. ShinMaywa has beencampaigning the US-1A for civilian applications throughout the Asia-Pacificregion.   A replacement for the air force's 31 Kawasaki C-1 medium troop/cargotransports also is being sought.   Budget highlights:  -- Although force consolidation prevails throughout the army, theParatroop Group, Helicopter Group and eight Hawk surface-to-air missilegroups remain as they are.  -- The 12th Div. will be shifted from a ground force to an air mobileforce, signaling a need for a helicopter transport buildup.  -- The navy's land-based antisubmarine warfare aircraft will be reducedfrom 16 units to 13.  -- The navy's tactical aircraft will be reduced from about 220 to 170.  -- The air force's three F-2 fighter squadrons, reconnaissance unit,three air transport units, AWACs patrols and six Patriot missile batteriesare retained as is.  -- But one of today's 10 interceptor fighter forces will be eliminated.  -- Tactical aircraft numbers will drop from 430 to 400, with acorresponding drop in fighters from about 350 to 300.  -- Personnel will be reduced in favor of automation at 20 of 28 airdefense radar sites.

ANSELMO(WASHINGTON)   NASA has rejected Russian Space Agency proposals to build theinternational space station around Russia's orbiting Mir station, but hascountered with a proposal it believes would significantly reduce Moscow'sup-front commitment.   During six days of meetings in Houston just before Christmas, NASAofficials outlined an ambitious, multifaceted plan to their Russiancounterparts that would allow the RSA to delay or modify its contributionof several large components to the international project withoutsubstantially altering the station's design or initial assembly schedule.   The proposals would significantly reduce the number of Russian launchesduring the initial assembly phase of the international station and allowMir to continue to be utilized for scientific missions until at least2000.   The Russian station, which was orbited in 1986, was scheduled to shutdown when assembly on the international station began in November, 1997.But it has lasted longer than expected.   Russian officials do not want to abandon Mir before its life ends, butthey also don't have the money or launch capability to conduct stationassembly flights and resupply Mir at the same time. That dilemma led to twoproposals the Russians made in Houston to connect the early elements of theinternational station to Mir (AW&ST Dec. 11, 1995, p. 35).   Among the key points in NASA's counterproposal, according to sources:  -- Russia would build and launch the station service module on the thirdassembly flight in April, 1998, as scheduled. RSA officials had proposeddelaying the module, which is critical to the station's early assemblysequence, or making modifications that might cause a delay.  -- Delivery of three Russian research modules and a Science PowerPlatform (SPP) to power them would be delayed for several years. Rollcontrol that would have been provided to the station by the SPP could beprovided instead by a boom similar to the one that provides roll control onMir. NASA and RSA will also examine the feasibility of transferring twonewer Mir science modules, Spektr and Priroda, to the international stationin place of the brand new research modules.   Orbiting and outfitting the SPP and its arrays would have required sixlaunches on Proton boosters, and the three research labs would haverequired three additional launches. The substitute boom will require onlytwo Russian launches.  -- Russian launches would be further reduced by using the space shuttle,instead of Russia's Soyuz vehicle, for changing out crews afterhuman-tended capability is reached. NASA officials believe the shuttle canaccommodate the additional 1,800 lb. that would be added to stationassembly flights to transport crews. Russian cosmonaut requirements on theinternational station would also be reduced until its research modules weredelivered.  -- NASA's Mission Control Center at Johnson Space Center would expandits role during the assembly sequence. RSA officials had said their controlcenter in Moscow would be overburdened handling both its share of stationassembly and Mir.  -- NASA will consider extending ``Phase 1'' scientific and engineeringexperiments on Mir into 1998 or 1999, which would mean increased payment toMoscow for ``rent'' of the facility.   Russian officials had complained they were responsible for too much ofthe early elements of station assembly. NASA's plan is aimed atsignificantly delaying much of that contribution without affecting thedesign or assembly of U.S., European, Japanese or Canadian components.Russia is not the first station partner with money problems. In fact, Japanis the only one that has not reduced its commitment.   IN RELATED NEWS, prime station contractor Boeing said damage to a flightarticle for the FGB space tug--which is being paid for by NASA but isscheduled to be built and launched by Russia--will not delay its plannedlaunch in November, 1997, as the first station element.   Boeing said an error by a Russian test operator caused a pressuredifferential that damaged the FGB's internal bulkhead and elements of threeforward sections of its pressurized instrument module.Photograph(s):Photograph: NASA has proposed delaying some Russian components for theinternational space station for several years, but U.S., European, Japaneseand Canadian hardware would be assembled on schedule.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NBOEING MOVES AHEAD WITH SEA LAUNCH VENTUREBy:JOSEPH C. ANSELMO(WASHINGTON)A hefty order from Hughes and a key regulatory go-ahead from the U.S.government has allowed Boeing to move full speed ahead with a uniqueinternational partnership to launch payloads from a sea-based platform.   The Sea Launch venture between Boeing, Russia's RSC Energia, Ukraine'sNPO Yuzhnoye and Kvaerner Group, a Norwegian ship builder, was first madepublic last April (AW&ST Apr. 17, 1995, p. 25).   Boeing officials, however, had been unclear for several months whetherthe U.S. government would permit them to conduct enough launches to makethe $500-million venture commercially viable.   Approval finally came last month, when the Clinton Administration gaveSea Launch permission to conduct at least 11 geosynchronous launches andpossibly 14 through the end of 2001 as part of a launch agreement withUkraine (AW&ST Dec. 18/25, 1995, p. 97).   THE ADMINISTRATION decided to fold Sea Launch into the agreement becauseit will employ two stages from Ukraine's Zenit booster. Boeing had objectedto being covered under the Ukrainian quotas. But company officials now saythey can live with the number of launches they have been allowed.   Another key piece of the puzzle fell into place last month with thefinalization of a commitment from Hughes Space and Communications topurchase at least 10 launches. That deal, worth about $1 billion withoptions, provided Boeing and its partners with the financial impetus toproceed.   The launch venture is also discussing launch services with another U.S.satellite manufacturer and hopes to announce a deal within two months,according to Sea Launch President Ronald C. Olson.   Sea Launch plans to use a complex mix of booster components and supportequipment from around the globe to offer launch services from a converted31,000-ton North Sea oil rig.   Besides the two stages from Ukraine's Zenit booster, the venture plansto use a Russian Block DM upper stage. The stages would be shippedpiecemeal to the U.S., where they would be integrated with American-builtfairings and adaptors. Launches would take place in the Pacific Ocean ininternational waters south of Hawaii.   The oil rig is currently being converted to a launch platform in Norway,while a Sea Launch command and control ship is under construction at ashipyard in Scotland.   Sea Launch plans to orbit its first payload, a yet-to-be-designatedHughes satellite, in 1998. The venture plans at least one other launch thatyear, and ultimately hopes to ramp up to 6-8 launches a year, Olson said.   The Sea Launch booster is designed to carry 12,000 lb. of payload togeosynchronous orbit. That would allow it to orbit a next-generation HughesHS-702 satellite with room to spare for a smaller, piggybacked payload.   Olson said he believes his company's main competitor will be Europe'sArianespace consortium.   ``We're not going after [U.S.] government or NASA business,'' he said.``Our goal is to take market share away from Arianespace. Right now theyenjoy about 60% of the market share. We'd like to get that percentage backin the United States.''Olson said Boeing will hold the largest share of Sea Launch, 40%, whileRussia's RSC Energia will hold a 25% share, the Norwegian Kvaerner Group a20% stake and Ukraine's NPO Yuzhnoye 15%.   Energia's share is larger than Yuzhnoye's because 60% of the Zenit'scomponents actually come from Russia, including its Energomash-suppliedengines, Olson said.   He said Sea Launch is negotiating to establish a ``home port'' for itsship and an assembly facility in Long Beach, Calif.Photograph(s):Photograph: This 430-ft. long, 31,000-ton oil-drilling platform is beingconverted at a shipyard in Stavanger, Norway.

Data for the first image released last month was gathered in lateNovember. It is possible to see the effects of high winds on the watersurface since the waves generated strong radar returns (see bright area inupper left of image). The image covers an area 132-km. wide and it wastaken from an altitude of 156 km.   Dennis M. Nazarenko, manager of application solutions at RadarsatInternational, said the images are close to specifications. The satelliteis not in its final orbit yet, and data-processing software is still beingfine-tuned.   John Hornsby, Radarsat International's director of operations, said thecompany is still in the early phase of commissioning the satellite, whichwill take about three months. Radarsat expects to begin providing imagesfor commercial use in mid-February. The satellite was launched on Nov. 4.   Radarsat plans to certify ground stations in Norway, the United Kingdomand Singapore after tests of acquisition and processing capabilitiesstarting early this month. Hornsby said he expects a number of other groundstations to come on line in 1996. Stations may be commissioned inAustralia, Africa and Brazil, and there is also interest in China andJapan.   Hornsby said Radarsat International is already studying possibleimprovements that might be made in a second satellite. Some long lead timehardware will probably be ordered for Radarsat 2 later this year.   Radarsat International worked with Spar Aerospace Ltd. to design, buildand launch the satellite under the aegis of the Canadian Space Agency. BallAerospace & Technologies Corp. built the spacecraft bus.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NATLAS SETS RECORD(CAPE CANAVERAL)Lockheed Martin capped a record year of space launches in 1995 when itsAtlas-Centaur successfully orbited Hughes' Galaxy 3R satellite to serve thedirect-to-home television market throughout Latin America.   Atlas-Centaur 120 lifted off Pad 36A here on time at 1923 EST, Dec. 14.The Atlas 2A vehicle had a smooth ascent, and about 29 min. after launchthe Centaur upper stage separated to leave the HS-601 satellite in itsgeosynchronous transfer orbit.   The launch was the 11th of an Atlas-Centaur vehicle from Complex 36 herein 1995. That was the most Atlases ever launched in one year.   Hughes Space and Communications Co. engineers took more than 4 hr. togain full communications with the spacecraft after it reached that orbit.Hughes officials were unavailable to explain the delay.   The satellite was expected to take about 10 days to maneuver to itsgeosynchronous station at 95 W. Long., after which it is to undergo severalweeks of testing before becoming operational in January.   Galaxy 3R has 24 C-band transponders that will be used to providebroadcast programming to the continental U.S. It also has 24 Ku-bandtransponders that will be used by Galaxy Latin America to deliver DirecTVentertainment programming to Mexico, Central and South America, and theCaribbean.

The cross-link capability supports the existing Milstar low data ratepayload and the planned medium data rate system being developed for Block 2Milstars.   Cross-linking enables a message to be routed around the Milstarsatellite constellation for downlink to a destination terminal. The systemprovides secure inter-satellite communications by using specificfrequencies and high-gain, narrow-beam antennas, program officials said.   The first cross-linked message was uplinked from the Military CommandCenter in Virginia Dec. 15 through the first Milstar satellite, developmentflight satellite-1 (DFS-1), which was placed in orbit in February, 1994.The message then was relayed directly to the second of two Block 1spacecraft launched in November. Development flight satellite-2 downlinkedthe message to Pacific Command in Hawaii.   The two spacecraft combined have a cross-link coverage extending fromEurope and Africa to beyond the Hawaiian Islands, program officials said.   Milstar's cross-linking capability is intended to provide a worldwidecommunications capability when the constellation is completed around theturn of the century, with four spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit, programofficials said.   The third spacecraft is scheduled to be completed in 1998, while thelast three Milstar 2s are set for delivery in 1999, 2000 and 2001.   The medium data rate payload was added to Block 2 satellites as a resultof a program restructuring in 1991. Lockheed Martin is prime contractor forMilstar.

AIR will be formed this week to streamline the three partners' widerange of 29-115-seat regional commercial transports. In the long term, AIRplans to launch all-new aircraft, although no specific timeframe has beendetermined yet.   Aerospatiale, Alenia and British Aerospace each own a 33.3% stake inAIR, a company headquartered in Toulouse.   ``A major European [aircraft manufacturer] is born. The joint venture isopen to new partners, European and from outside Europe,'' AIR ChiefExecutive Officer Henri-Paul Puel said.   AIR, although not expected to cut excess production capacity soon, ispaving the way for a unified organization holding a major share in theregional aircraft market. However, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA) andFokker, its Dutch affiliate, are not involved and remain AIR's competitors,as does Sweden's Saab-Scania, a stand-alone regional aircraft producer.   ``AIR's doors are wide open to welcome DASA. We cannot envisage building[regional transports] in Europe without the Germans,'' Puel said.``However, I am not sure Fokker still does exist,'' he cynically added,referring to the Dutch manufacturer's deep financial difficulties.   During the next 2-4 years, AIR's priority will be to market and supportexisting products still manufactured by the founding partners, includingenhanced derivatives. In the U.S., AIR Marketing Inc. of Chantilly, Va.,will succeed ATR's North American sales branch. Product support will behandled by AIR Support Inc. of Sterling, Va.AIR's product range comprises:  -- Jetstream twin turboprops. Jetstream Aircraft, a Scotland-basedBritish Aerospace subsidiary, is producing the 29-seat Jetstream 41 twinturboprop transport. Jetstream concluded orders for 103 41s and delivered67 aircraft to eight operators in 1995. Although the 19-seat Jetstream 31is still being marketed, production was recently terminated and additionalaircraft will now be manufactured to order only.  -- ATR twin turboprops. Avions de Transport Regional, a Toulouse-basedAerospatiale-Alenia consortium, is producing 48-66-seat ATR42/72 twinturboprop transports and enhanced derivatives such as the higherperformance ATR42-500. ATR has received orders for 290 ATR42s and delivered284 aircraft. The consortium sold 172 ATR72s and delivered 160 aircraft.Late last month, the combined ATR42/72 backlog was only 18 aircraft, a lowlevel tied to weak sales in 1995. However, major orders are currently beingnegotiated, Puel claimed.  -- Avro jet transports. Woodford-based Avro International Aerospace,also a British Aerospace subsidiary, produces 70-115-seat, four-engineRJ70, RJ85, RJ100 and RJ115 transports. In 1993, the enhanced RJ linesucceeded British Aerospace BAe-146 models with the same capacities. Avrohas received orders for 95 RJs and delivered 46 aircraft.   THIS YEAR, THE AIR partners plan to produce about 100 aircraft,comprising 25 Jetstream 41s, 25 RJs and 50 ATRs, generating sales estimatedat $1.2 billion, Puel said.   This week, AIR will establish an integrated management staff, located inATR's corporate headquarters building next to Toulouse airport. TheFrench-based management, marketing and product support services will haveabout 700 employees. In addition, nearly 100 employees will be based inItaly, 50 in the U.S. and 50 in the Pacific Rim. The integration isscheduled to extend over the 1996-98 period, company officials said.   The three partners' product support activities are scheduled to becombined on June 1. By the end of the year, unified spare part activitieswill be established at Weybridge in the U.K. Training facilities, includingflight simulators, will be transferred gradually to Naples, Italy.   NEARLY 200 CARRIERS around the world currently operate more than 1,450aircraft produced by AIR's partners. ATR, Jetstream and Avro delivered morethan 1,200 regional aircraft. In addition, AIR will also support earlieraircraft types such as 50-seat Hawker Siddeley HS-748s, 70-seat BritishAerospace Jetstream 61s/ATPs and 19-seat Jetstream 31s, an AIR officialsaid.   The new company's scope is scheduled to expand broadly when all-newprograms are launched. Before the agreement to form AIR, ATR planned todevelop an 80-seat twin turboprop transport, known as the ATR82. And Avrowas considering a twinjet derivative of the RJ, expected to be equippedwith CFM56 Lite turbofan engines planned by CFM International, a GeneralElectric-Snecma joint company. Such new concepts are now scheduled to bereplaced by AIR-developed aircraft.   Launching an all-new, 100-seat twinjet could become AIR's first majorinitiative, company officials acknowledged. However, the future of such aconcept is tied to the outcome of the proposed AE-100 Asian Expressprogram. Aviation Industries of China (AVIC) and the Korean CommercialAircraft Development Consortium (KCDC) have not decided yet on a Westernpartner for the 100-seat-category twinjet (AW&ST Oct. 16, 1995, p. 23).   Last month, AIR formed Beijing-based Aero International Asia. DASA andFokker are promoting a rival concept, and two U.S. manufacturers, Boeingand McDonnell Douglas, also submitted offerings.   AVIC and KCDC planned to select a Western partner in September, butdelayed their decision and are now planning a two-step selection procedure.Two finalists are expected to be retained, and the winner will be selecteda few weeks later.   AVIC and KCDC plan to offer a 5-6% share in the AE-100 to an additionalpartner, Singapore Aerospace or Hindustan Aeronautics, before the programis formally launched.   ``If a U.S. manufacturer wins, the Europeans will think seriously aboutlaunching their own [100-seat twinjet] program,'' Antonio Di Blasi said. Heis AIR senior vice president-projects and strategic marketing.   At this stage, the planned AE-100 program is resulting in increasinglycomplex issues. Chinese and Korean industry officials apparentlyunderestimated the numerous problems that must be resolved before such aglobal undertaking can materialize, a French official pointed out. Inaddition, Alenia, AIR's Italian arm, is a risk-sharing partner in the newlylaunched 100-seat McDonnell Douglas MD-95 twinjet transport.   The AE-100's basic model, a 108-seat aircraft, will be followed by ashortened, 95-seat derivative and a stretched, 137-seat version, AVICManaging Director Gao Zhanmin recently said. The twinjet, as currentlyenvisioned by AVIC's Beijing-based engineering team, would have a50-metric-ton (110,000-lb.) maximum takeoff weight, Mach 0.78 cruise speedand 1,500-km. (810-naut.-mi.) range at maximum payload. No engine type hasbeen specified yet.   According to a French industry official, an all-new 100-seat twinjetwill be economically justified if it can offer direct operating costs atleast 10% below those of existing aircraft such as the Fokker 100 and theAvro RJ or newly-launched programs--Boeing's 737-600 and McDonnell Douglas'MD-95.   AIR participants are considering a five-abreast cabin configuration. Theresulting aircraft would not compete with the wider-fuselage, 124-seatA319, the Airbus Industrie consortium's smallest aircraft, the Frenchofficial said.Photograph(s):Photograph: AIR's product range includes the 29-seat Jetstream 41 (bottom),the 66-seat ATR72 (center) and the 70-seat Avro RJ70 (top), seen hereflying in close formation.

The imminent flights will mark the first completely new aircraft to betested by the famed Mikoyan organization since the MiG-29 first flew 15years ago.   Mikoyan officials are planning the AT's scheduled first takeoff by Jan.20 and the new fighter's initial flight also early this year.   The tests will be conducted at the Ramenskoye Flight Test Center nearMoscow, where the aircraft were making final high-speed taxi runs in lateDecember. Mikoyan chief test pilot, Taskayev Roman, will fly bothaircraft.   In addition to the initial flights with the new fighter and trainer,MAPO-MiG will accelerate midair refueling tests with MiG-29M aircraft,which earlier could not be refueled in flight. The Russian air force hopesto buy 30 MiG-29Ms with the new refueling capability this year.   MAPO-MiG also plans to redesignate newer versions of the MiG-29M as theMiG-33, although there will be no differences in flight hardware betweenthe two designations.   The revival of MiG flight test activity is being aided by a rejuvenatedMikoyan financial/industrial base. The new business foundation stems fromthe design bureau's merger with MAPO, the Moscow Aircraft ProductionOrganization that built MiG aircraft during the Soviet era. Several banksare also part of the organization, which has been designated a``financial/industrial group'' under Russian law.   Vladimir Kuzmin, who earlier headed MAPO, is director general of the neworganization. He shares some of that overall responsibility with RostislavBelyakov, who headed Mikoyan as its general designer. Belyakov, who hasbeen battling ill health, has a direct management line to the head ofdesign/development, Anatoliy Belosvet.   A recent influx of funding from the Russian Ministry of Defense forflight test of the new advanced fighter will also help the company, Russiansources said.   The aircraft, informally called the MiG-1.42, carries the officialdesignation of MFI (loosely translated as ``multifunction fighter''). Thetwin-engine MFI is designed to be both a military and commercial competitorto the Lockheed Martin F-22, the Eurofighter 2000 and the Dassault Rafale.The Russian aircraft has 16 control surfaces, including canards and a twintail, that are driven by a fly-by-wire system. It was initially to haveflown in 1995, but funding problems and the need to conduct further testingon control system actuators pushed the scheduled first flight into early1996.   The aircraft is to have supersonic cruise (``supercruise'') capabilityand limited stealth characteristics.   If the fighter has a successful flight test program, it would not enterservice until after 2000. In contrast, the new MiG-AT trainer would beginfield evaluations at a Russian air force school within a few months of itsinitial flight, if selected by the Defense Ministry over the Yakovlev Yak/AEM-130, a competing trainer.   Through late December, the AT had completed at least five high-speedtaxi tests. Like the new fighter, the AT was to have flown in 1995 but wasslowed by funding delays.   Russia plans to buy 250-300 trainers to replace its current Czech-builtL -29 and L-39 aircraft. The winner will also have export opportunities,and already India and Uzbekistan have signed options to procure the newtrainer.   MAPO-MiG IS WORKING with France's Snecma and Turbomeca, which willsupply the AT's twin Larzac engines. Export versions, to be marketed bySnecma, would also have a Sextant Avionique/Gosniias glass cockpit.Yakovlev is teamed with Italy's Aermacchi for development of theYak/AEM-130, which has a fly-by-wire control system and two Klimov turbofanengines (AW&ST June 26, 1995, p. 26).   Details emerging from the Russian Defense Ministry indicated a splitover which aircraft is favored. At least some senior air force managershave expressed a preference for the Yak/AEM-130, but Russian Air DefenseForce (PVO) officers earlier liked the MiG-AT (AW&ST Sept. 12, 1994, p.43).   While the MiG-AT is set to fly by Jan. 20, the Yak/AEM-130 will not makeits first flight until well into 1996, Russian sources said. No decisionwill be made until after flight tests begin, but it could come relativelyearly in the flight test phase, they said.   Yakovlev will test a single aircraft, but MAPO-MiG officials believe aplan to ``field-test'' several ATs in parallel with traditional flighttesting will work to their advantage in the Defense Ministry's decision.Under the plan, MAPO-MiG would produce 15 ATs in 1996 and provide 5-7 ofthem immediately to one of the four Russian air force flight trainingschools.   MiG engineers believe another factor in their favor is that the initialflight test aircraft is composed of 25% ``serial'' components and structureidentical to and off the same tooling that would be used for productionaircraft. This 25% includes the horizontal stabilizer and the wing with itsintegral fuel tanks.   The second MiG-AT is in advanced fabrication and will have 50% of itsstructure as serial components. The third aircraft will be the same asproduction versions from a design and production tooling standpoint.   These first three aircraft would all go into the AT flight test programat Ramenskoye, while the fourth aircraft would be devoted to static loadstesting.   If selected by the Russian government, MAPO-MiG would produce 35 ATs in1997 and 50 in 1998. The company believes there is global market potentialfor about 1,200 AT aircraft.   While testing the new fighter and trainer, MAPO-MiG this year will alsoincrease testing of the MiG-29M--to be redesignated the MiG-33. Theevaluations will continue new air refueling system development begun inlate 1995 and tests of the aircraft using laser-guided bombs.   Recent weapon tests with laser-guided bombs indicate that theMiG-29M/MiG-33 radar has the capability to acquire a ground target atranges up to 50 km. (31 mi.), a distance greater than earlier testsindicated. The aircraft can then use its own laser designator, or a laserdesignation by ground forces, to guide the weapon once it is dropped.   WHILE THE NEW PROGRAMS show that the Russian air force is trying tomaintain advanced developments, the air force budget will have to beincreased significantly if any of these aircraft are to be placed inproduction.   During all of 1995, for example, the air force ordered only 15 newaircraft including helicopters. Of these, only two were fighters.   Last year, MAPO-MiG built 35 of the standard MiG-29 version, and nonewere delivered to the Russian air force. Seven of the aircraft weredelivered to Slovakia and 10 to Hungary in exchange for Russian debtrelief.   The only funded MiG-29 deliveries were to Malaysia, which received 18 in1995. An additional 18 MiG-29s are expected to be ordered by Malaysia undera new procurement cycle that begins this year (AW&ST Dec. 18/25, 1995, p.12).Illustration(s):Illustration: The new MiG-1.42 ``MFI'' fighter will have a supersoniccruise (``supercruise'') capability.

Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems has delayed first flight of theC-130J by about a month to complete functional testing and debugging of thenew, software-laden transport's systems.   Program managers had expected to have run C-130J No. 1's AllisonAE2100D3 engines, with their six-bladed Dowty Aerospace R391 propellers, bymid-December. While the aircraft had been fueled, the engines had not beenrun by Dec. 21.   Low-speed taxi tests were delayed, as was the first flight, whichtentatively had been scheduled for about Dec. 27. That flight is nowtargeted for the second half of this month.   In addition to the enhanced performance that the Allison/Dowtypowerplant provides, the C-130J uses fully integrated digital avionicsbuilt around 10 Mil-Std 1553B data buses and two mission computers.   The aircraft also has a two-pilot flight deck with a front panel of fourlarge and five smaller liquid crystal displays and two Flight Dynamicshead-up primary flight instrument displays.   Countering the testing setback was the Royal Australian Air Force'sorder for 12 C-130Js, with options to buy more. The C-130Js are to replacethe RAAF's 12 C-130Es. Additional aircraft could be used for tanker andairborne early warning missions and for the eventual replacement of the airforce's 12 C-130Hs.   The $670-million contract calls for Lockheed to deliver the aircraftover the next five years.   ``This is an important signing for the C-130J,'' said Al Hansen,executive vice president for Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems. ``Manycustomers in the Asia-Pacific area use the Royal Australian Air Force as aguide in ordering their own equipment.''The Australian contract brings the number of C-130Js ordered this year to39.   The No. 1 test aircraft is the first of 25 stretched -30 versions of theC-130J that Lockheed Martin is building for the United Kingdom's Royal AirForce. The U.S. Air Force also has ordered two standard-length C-130Js.   Aircraft No.1's first flight is to launch a test program of about 1,000flight hours. The second and third aircraft are to join the flight testprogram next month, with a fourth and fifth coming on line in March.Photograph(s):Photograph: Australia's contract bolsters the C-130J order book.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NAGM-130 SEEKER TESTED(BOSTON)   The U.S. Air Force and Rockwell International have successfully tested anew infrared seeker on the precision-guided, rocket-propelled AGM-130 thatcan be launched at a target from more than 40 mi. away.   AGM-130s with television seekers or an earlier-generation scanninginfrared seeker are now in the U.S. Air Force weapons inventory and couldbe used in Bosnia if needed. The weapon was just entering service duringDesert Storm and was not used in that conflict. The AGM-130 has either a2,000-lb. blast/fragmentation warhead or a similar weight penetrating bombwith a forged steel case. It can be dropped from as low as 200 ft. to hittargets 15 mi. away, or from altitudes of more than 30,000 ft. to hittargets more than 40 mi. away.   When it is dropped at 200 ft., the rocket motor boosts the weapon up toa cruising altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 ft. After rocket burnout, the weaponglides to its target. An aircraft might fly low to hide behind terrain orfly high and stand off at a considerable distance from the target.   After launch from an F-15E or an F-111, the bomb glides for a while andthen is boosted by a rocket motor. The motor drops off after it is expendedand the weapon continues to glide. An INS/GPS unit puts the weapon in thecorrect position about 15 sec. before impact for a weapon system operatorin the fighter aircraft to guide it in manually using imagery from thetelevision or infrared seeker.   The seeker tested late last year at Eglin AFB, Fla., is a staring focalplane array made of mercury cadmium telluride with 256 X 256 elements. Itwas produced by Rockwell's Autonetics & Missile Systems Div. The staringfocal plane array is interchangeable with the charged coupled device cameraused in the weapon. The new seeker has a cryogenic cooling subsystem.   The test at Eglin involved an F-15E dropping a Rockwell AGM-130 whileflying at 480 KTAS at an altitude of 2,000 ft. The aircraft was 14.2 n.m.from the target and the weapon made a direct hit. A Rockwell official saidthe new infrared seeker has greatly improved sensitivity and performsbetter in adverse weather conditions.Photograph(s):Photograph: A USAF F-15E launched this AGM-130 with a new Rockwell seekerat 2,000 ft. and 480 KTAS.

The WorldSpace/ Alcatel system could revolutionize the way radiobroadcasting is conducted around the world.   The WorldSpace system is specifically geared to bring digital radioservices, including programs by international broadcasters such as theVoice of America, to 3.5 billion people living in developing nations.   Alcatel Espace of Paris is the prime contractor for the WorldSpaceorganization, based in Washington. Matra Marconi will be Alcatel's majorsubcontractor in the project.   IN ADDITION TO coordinating the space segment, Alcatel will build theadvanced broadcast system to be integrated with all three Matra satellites.This system will include the On-Board Baseband Processor (OBP) on eachsatellite that will continually switch among dozens of radiouplink/downlink channels.   WorldSpace secured up to $650 million in financing for the long-termproject and signed Alcatel to an overall contract worth $600 million.   The initial down payment on that contract enabled Alcatel in lateDecember to select Matra Marconi for a contract worth $100-150 million todevelop the initial three satellites.   Matra was selected over Aerospatiale, Alenia and Space Systems/Loral.Alcatel had in fact negotiated complete (but unsigned) contracts with allfour competitors before selecting a final bidder, according to FrancisFraikin, Alcatel's director of commercial telecommunications.   The first spacecraft, designated AfriStar-1, is to be launched inmid-1998, and placed in geosynchronous orbit over Africa at 21 deg. E.Long. From that location, its three spot beams will cover all of Africa,Turkey and the Middle East.   Two additional spacecraft are to be launched by mid-1999. The secondsatellite will be CaribStar-1, to be positioned over the Pacific off SouthAmerica at 95 deg. W. Long. Its spot beams will cover all of Mexico andCentral and South America, as well as the Caribbean.   The third satellite, AsiaStar-1, will be positioned at 105 deg. W.Long., where it could beam radio broadcasts into all of India, southern andeastern China and the entire Pacific basin.   Each of the 2.7-metric-ton advanced Eurostar-type spacecraft will have a5.5-kw. power capability and a planned orbital lifetime of 15 years.   Much of the area to be served by the WorldSpace system now relies onantiquated shortwave broadcasts. The three satellites will enable bothlocally based broadcasters, as well as major ``world service'' networks, tobeam high-quality signals to millions of square miles of rugged terrainwith minimal ground infrastructure.   Each spacecraft will have 288 standard ``voice'' channels that can becombined by the OBP system into 144 individual ``monoaural-music'' channelsor 72 high-quality channels that can provide music with compact disc (CD)quality. Stations using the satellites will be able to mix and matchchannel needs, depending upon their broadcast plans each day. The OBPsystem will make the proper allocations on board the satellite.   The three satellites combined will have 216 CD-quality channels.WorldSpace will offer 126 of these for sale to international and nationalbroadcasters. The Voice of America and Holland's Radio Nederland havealready signed up for this service. The remaining 90 channels will bereserved for ``pay-radio'' services. WorldSpace is also selecting companiesto build the system's small, low-cost radios.   ALCATEL MANAGERS VIEW the program as vital to positioning the company asa full satellite service provider in the 21st century, Fraikin said.   Alcatel is also completing contract arrangements with GE Americom,Princeton, N. J., for the separate $240-million ``Starsys'' program inwhich Alcatel would provide the GE unit with up to 24 small satellites totrack vehicle fleets.   A contract for the first six satellites and their launch costs would beworth about $100 million, according to Norbert Lannelongue, Alcateldirector of Observation Sciences.   The major new element for Alcatel is to jump from the role of providingjust a communications payload for a satellite to the new, higher level ofproviding a complete telecommunications system that includes thesatellites, ground system and revenue generating services, Fraikin said.   ``We are alone in Europe as a company that is both in the satellitebusiness and is also a telecommunications company,'' he said.Photograph(s):Photograph: Matra Marconi Space will provide advanced versions of thisEurostar spacecraft for the WorldSpace/Alcatel system.MARIO FOURMY/REACopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NUSAF STEPS UP PACE OF BOSNIA AIRLIFTBy:DAVID HUGHES(BOSTON)The U.S. Air Force intensified the pace of air operations into Bosnia andHungary over the Christmas holidays, taking advantage of good weather byconducting 50-60 flights a day to four airfields in the theater.   The weather cleared on Dec. 21 after several days of low clouds and fog,and the Air Force was able to operate nearly 100 C-130 and C-17 missionsinto Tuzla by Christmas day. As of Dec. 27, there had been a total of 164missions flown to Tuzla carrying 1,235 tons of cargo. Other destinationsserved include Sarajevo, Zagreb and Taszar in Hungary.   C-141s began flying into Bosnia on Christmas eve, when the firstStarlifter touched down at Tuzla. This aircraft was operated by the 16thAirlift Sqdn. at Charleston, S.C., the only -141 unit with a specialoperations mission. The pilots are trained in low-level navigation and inthe use of night vision goggles but did not need these special proceduresat Tuzla. The airport is now equipped with TACAN and with precisionapproach radar (PAR).   The first C-17 to land at Tuzla arrived on Dec. 19 with a self-propelled155-mm. howitzer, a support vehicle and trailer. Prior to Dec. 8, when aC-17 landed at Sarajevo carrying humanitarian supplies, the aircraft hadnot participated in any U.S. airlift operations into Bosnia. The C-17 cancarry four times the payload of the C-130.   As of Dec. 26, the C-17 provided lift for more passengers and cargo insupport of Operation Joint Endeavor than C-5s or C-141s (see chart below).C-130s from Air Combat Command logged 242 missions in support of theoperation and carried 1,269 passengers and 2,221 tons of cargo as of Dec.28.   Twelve C-17s have deployed from Charleston AFB, to Rhein Main AB inGermany to support Bosnia operations. Tuzla can only accommodate one C-17(or one C-141) in addition to 3 C-130s on the ground at the same time.   Air Force Mission Planning System computers were airlifted by C-17s toEurope. This system built by Sanders is being used to plan C-17 routes intoBosnian airports and creating mission profiles.

McKENNA(MELBOURNE, FLA.)Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Services technicians have completed arush installation of upgraded modems in 38 Block 40 F-16s to improve theaircraft's close-air support capabilities for NATO operations in Bosnia.   Developed by the Naval Research Laboratory and produced by SymetricsIndustries Inc. here, the Improved Data Modems (IDMs) are designed toincrease the interoperability of units from the various U.S. militaryservices in combat. The high-speed, burst data modem shifts frequencies tofrustrate interception and jamming and is capable of translatingcommunications transmitted in various military protocols, such as the U.S.Air Force's AFAPD, the Army's TACFIRE and the Navy/Marine Corps MTS.   Each of the modem's two digital signal processors can handle twochannels, working with the aircraft's ARC 164 UHF HQII and ARC 186 radios.When wired into the aircraft, the modem permits the pilot to receive voiceand data communications simultaneously on a single radio channel.   The modem also includes a generic interface processor, a power convertercard and a KY58 encryption device.   The modems already are in use supporting thesuppression-of-enemy-air-defenses capabilities of Block 50 F-16s.   Lockheed Martin and Symetrics responded to an Air Force request toquickly equip the Block 40 F-16s slated for close-air support (CAS)missions in Bosnia. Symetrics' workers produced 41 IDMs in 30 days, and theLockheed Martin technicians installed the units in 36 aircraft at AvianoAB, Italy, and two at Hill AFB.   The effort, dubbed Project Sure Strike, is intended in part todemonstrate the ability to meld the IDM's capabilities with those of theCAS Integrated Targeting System. That system consists of a Mark 7 lasertargeting, the AN/PSN-11 precision lightweight GPS receiver, a LittonHand-held Terminal Unit and a Magnavox AN/PRC-113 VHF/UHF radio.   The system is intended to allow ground troops to precisely guide theBlock 40 F-16 pilots to their CAS targets.   The modems on the aircraft are designed to handle both digital andanalog data and voice traffic through the F-16's installed radios,according to Jerry L. Sinclair, vice president of programs at Symetrics.   THE CURRENT INSTALLATION on the Block 40 F-16s restricts communicationsto TACFIRE communications, which is the protocol for the CAS IntegratedTargeting System. The aircraft operational flight programming must bealtered before takeoff if the mission calls for another protocol. The SEADBlock 50 F-16s have the capability to switch protocols on the fly.   The IDM passes signals from the ARC 164 or 186 radio over a Mil-Std 1553bus to the aircraft's fire control unit and to the pilot's HUD, where thesignal generates a target-designator box. The pilot can store up to fiveIDM targets and store or ignore IDM messages.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NCROATS PONDER EARLY PUSH INTO EASTERN SLAVONIABy:DAVID A. FULGHUM(WASHINGTON)Croatian leaders are believed to be weighing their army's chances ofrecapturing eastern Slavonia--possibly between mid-January andmid-March--instead of waiting for up to two years for a Serb pulloutenvisioned in the current regional peace plans.   In order to derail an offensive, senior U.S. defense officials say NATOforces will be very aggressive and intrusive in their aerial reconnaissanceof the region and will move quickly and with great force to derail anypreparations for renewed conflict. The contested portion of Croatia isbordered by Hungary on the north, Serbia on the east and Croatia on thesouth and west.   ``We don't think the Croats have made the decision [to attack] yet, butit is one of their serious planning options,'' a senior U.S. defenseofficial said.   Croat leaders could be tempted to launch an offensive for a variety ofweather-related, military and political reasons, according toWashington-based defense officials. Analyses show the initial key dangerperiod will run from the final pullout of United Nations' force inmid-January until the region's spring thaw, probably in mid-March.   KEY MANEUVER AREAS for tanks and other vehicles in the northern part ofSlavonia--the only remaining occupied area of Croatia, earlier known asUnited Nations Sector East--are swamps that will only support motorizedtraffic while frozen, U.S. officials point out. After the thaw, the Croats'slashing style of attack--involving armored spearheads and fast-movingcolumns of mobile troops--would be severely limited.   Moreover, expected bad winter weather and heavy cloud cover during theperiod could prevent Allied air attacks on the Croat attackers until afterSlavonia is reoccupied, a task that under ideal conditions could take onlya matter of hours, according to a senior U.S. military official.   The Croatian government is under intense pressure from nationalist hawksto retake the last part of Croatia still under Serb control. Nationalleaders believe NATO commanders may remain focused on Bosnia, allowing themto prepare for an attack with some degree of freedom.   ``The Belgian and Russian troops in the area now are clearly inadequate,and in an offensive would do little more than provide targets,'' thedefense official said.   Another temptation for the Croats is the relative slowness with whichNATO forces are moving into the region, establishing influence andbeginning to monitor military activities. By moving soon, the Croats mightface less NATO interference and fewer Allied troops.   Finally, the Croatian military high command has contempt--which somebelieve is misplaced--for the combat prowess of both the Bosnian Serbmilitary units and the Yugoslavian National Army (JNA).   Senior Croat military leaders consider the JNA, in particular, to be``clumsy , slow-moving and overly reliant on firepower and mass,'' thesenior U.S. military official said. ``The Croats point out very eagerlythat they would rely on tempo rather than mass. Their [doctrine is to]reach deep and seize key points; isolate rather than overwhelm.''   If the Croats retake eastern Slavonia, it will put them only the widthof the Danube River from Serbia which, so far, has stayed out of directparticipation in the Bosnian conflict. But a Croat attack to Serbia'sborders would be difficult for Serbia's leaders to swallow, and they mightretaliate.   ``If the attack were just in Sector East [eastern Slavonia], theCroatians can get to the Danube within hours, easily,'' the defenseofficial said. With heavy artillery, the Serbs could choose to saturate theadvancing Croats with long-range fire from across the river. ``They arevery good artillerymen,'' he said. To silence or inflict heavy damage onthe artillery, ``the Croats would have to go deep, use counter-battery fireand use their air force,'' striking into Serbia proper.   However, U.S. opinion is divided over what the JNA's response might beand its potential effectiveness. The Krajina Serbs occupying Sector Eastare seen as a great embarrassment to the Serbian national government. Ifthe Croats attacked quickly and were successful, there would likely belittle or no response from the JNA, a second senior U.S. defense officialsaid.   ``If they get bogged down [in an extended fight], the Serbs might beforced to weigh in,'' he said. ``The Croats really only have a small airforce'' consisting of a few dozen MiG-21 fighter bombers and Mi-24 attackhelicopters. ``If they tried striking across the Danube, the Serbian airforce could kick the hell out of them. It would be like poking at ahornet's nest.''   THIS SCENARIO COULD quickly undermine the fragile peace in the region.So the question for the West becomes how to contain such aggressive movesbefore they gather momentum. Western technology, much of it airborne, mayagain provide the answer. The U.S., in particular, is moving its mostsophisticated intelligence gathering aircraft into the region. Moreover,service planners are piecing together a sophisticated communicationsnetwork to collect, sort through and route this intelligence to keydecision makers that has no parallel, even in Desert Storm.   Central to the U.S. effort will be its nationally controlledsurveillance satellite network and the decidedly more flexible U.S. AirForce E-8 Joint-STARS, RC-135 Rivet Joint and EC-130 Airborne Command andControl Centers and British Nimrod electronic warfare aircraft. Alsodedicated to the peacekeeping task will be the joint-service,long-endurance Predator unmanned aerial vehicles that became operational in1995.   Some U.S. officials believe that, in particular, Joint-STARS'intelligence collecting capability will ``be used as a confidence buildingmeasure because it can look on both sides of the Danube River,'' theintelligence official said, keeping track of military preparations by allthe factions--Croat, Bosnian and Serb. And the U.S. plans to use itsreconnaissance forces aggressively.   ``We are going to enforce the peace our way,'' a U.S. military officialsaid. In order to prevent renewed hostilities, NATO forces will strike hardand preemptively at anyone seen making preparations for war, he said.   JOINT-STARS CAN accurately and continuously track ground vehicle andlow-flying helicopter traffic. Rivet Joint can plot the site and type ofelectronic emissions and even monitor military voice and datacommunications. Critical information, including the stated intentions ofsuspected commanders and activities of small units, could be interceptedand analyzed for NATO officials.   The Predator UAV, which is scheduled to return to Bosnian operations atthe beginning of March, even has additional operational versatility. It canfly directly over areas of interest, such as troop concentrations orcommand sites, to observe at low altitude without risk to aircrews.   Croatia formed the strike arm of its new air force aroundSoviet-designed MiG-21 fighter bombers and Mi-24 attack helicopters fromthe former East German air force. According to U.S. intelligence officials,the Croatian government has even more money to spend on arms, unlike manyother Eastern European nations, and continues to survey the world marketfor additional military equipment. U.S. officials decline to say how theformer East German equipment got to Croatia other than suggesting it was``not a state to state'' transfer.Photograph(s):Photograph: RC-135 Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft will play a key rolein policing the peace in Bosnia and eastern Slavonia.RANDY JOLLYCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NROUGH BALKAN TERRAIN FORCES CHANGE IN JOINT-STARS' TACTICSBy:DAVID A. FULGHUM(WASHINGTON)The U.S. E-8 Joint-STARS, NATO's major aerial platform for spying onBosnian military ground and helicopter traffic, will face much moredaunting terrain than it did in its 1991 operational debut in OperationDesert Storm.   Joint-STARS is expected to begin flying missions early this month toprovide NATO peacekeepers with improved situational awareness of Bosniangovernment and Bosnian Serb movements. During Desert Storm, the long-range,synthetic aperture radar-equipped aircraft were observing the virtuallyfeatureless desert plains of Kuwait and Iraq, where even wind-blown barbedwire could be seen by the aircraft's moving target indicator (MTI). Fromthe sky over Bosnia, U.S. military radar operators and analysts will haveto pick ground vehicles and low-flying helicopters out of topographystitched with mountains and ravines that can often block the radar's view.However, in compensation, the Bosnians will be restricted to a smallernumber of more predictable routes, generally following the valleys andpasses.   TO MINIMIZE THE radar's difficulties in looking into narrow valleys orthe far side of mountains, mission planners have been plotting a variety offlight tracks and orbits that will allow the two E-8s the most extendedlooks at crucial road, rail and low-level flight routes, according to AirForce and Northrop Grumman officials.   The first task was to get the necessary permissions and clearances tofly 60-120-n.m. tracks over Hungary, Croatia and the Adriatic Sea. With theaircraft sensor's ability to look out to a range of 200 n.m., its crew cankeep the Joint-STARS well beyond range of Bosnian Serb SA-2 and SA-6surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). Bosnian Serb threats to acquire thelong-range, more capable SA-10 SAMs have so far proven empty. Even so, noproposed Joint-STARS patrol tracks will position aircraft over Serbia orthe Bosnian Serb Republic.   Joint-STARS crewmen will rely on system-generated cues and predictivealgorithms that memorize the direction, speed and size of ground trafficand alert operators if vehicles of interest do not move as expected orpredicted.   ``If a [military] convoy disappears, it will alert you,'' a NorthropGrumman official said of the Joint-STARS system. ``It has a memory; itknows where to look'' for a string of vehicles, for example, to reappearout of a valley or tunnel or from behind a mountain.   The Joint-STARS' impressive computer memory also helps retain a radarpicture when the aircraft turns. The E-8 is limited to a 30-deg. bank, soit takes about 2 min. to reverse its course in order to start a new leg ofa patrol. The aircraft is largely blind during much of the turn, so thecomputer's memory is used to keep continuity in the ground picture.Operators generally monitor a 60 X 60-n.m. target area at any moment.   With only two available aircraft--a Desert Storm-veteran E-8A and thefirst new E-8C--and three trained crews, the amount of time E-8s will beavailable over Bosnia will be limited. Certainly, there will not bearound-the-clock coverage of Bosnia. It is likely the aircraft will be usedmost extensively at night and in bad weather, two periods that treatyviolators would use to hide prohibited movements. The radar on the thirdJoint-STARS aircraft, another A-model, has been removed. A fourth crew isin training and might be available for Bosnian operations.   The E-8C will have an almost all-military crew with only three or fourcontractor personnel on board for maintenance chores. The older aircraftstill requires some contractor operators, an Air Force official said.Ironically, the older aircraft actually have better imagery resolution thanthe E-8C with its larger crew and more powerful computers. The E-8C isawaiting an improvement to duplicate the older aircraft's image clarity.About 25 contractor personnel have deployed to Rhein Main, Germany, withthe two aircraft.   ONE HOT TOPIC OF debate in the surveillance community is how to bestfind and track helicopter traffic. Helicopters have been used by all thewarring parties to violate United Nations no-fly zones, and NATO observersare particularly eager to monitor and control such flights. Joint-STARS cantrack helicopters, and the system will note and remember the distinctive``pig-tail or death spiral'' pattern at the end of most helicopter flights.As a result, Joint-STARS operators can plot sites regularly used byhelicopters for takeoffs and landings, such as headquarters, forwardrefueling and rearming locations or other command and control sites, aNorthrop Grumman official said. A variety of such clues will be used toanalyze and predict helicopter and ground traffic.   Joint-STARS also can receive the aerial picture from an E-3 AWACS, thusallowing the E-8's operators to make a more comprehensive analysis ofBosnian activities. AWACS does not have the capability of receiving theJoint-STARS picture.Photograph(s):Photograph: Joint-STARS aircraft will face new challenges in trackingvehicles and helicopters in Bosnia's mountainous terrain.RANDY JOLLYCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NELECTRONIC TAGS TO TRACK CARGO BOUND FOR BOSNIABy:DAVID HUGHES/BOSTON   U.S. Transportation Dept. cargo tracking specialists are helping theU.S. Army create a system for tagging nearly all military cargo headed forBosnia so it can be tracked electronically and monitored via satellite.   Commercial electronic tags will be put on nearly all containers headedinto Bosnia. The tags, which will include cargo data, have small radiotransmitters with a limited range that can communicate with interrogationunits. These units will be placed at choke points on the land routes intoBosnia and installed along with commercial-grade satellite communicationstransmitters to beam data back to the U.S. via Inmarsat.   Savi Technology, a company recently acquired by Texas Instruments, issupplying some of the tags. Each one includes a miniature radio transceiverand a microcomputer in a package about the size of a deck of playingcards.   WHEN TAGGED CARGO en route to Bosnia passes an interrogator, thenear-real-time data on cargo type and location will be received at acommand center in the Volpe Transportation System Center in Cambridge,Mass., where the International Transportation Information Tracking(Intransit) group works. This is the same group that tracked the shipmentof Patriot missiles to South Korea for the U.S. Army in 1994 (AW&ST May16, 1994, p. 59).   The Intransit specialists will also install a monitoring station for theArmy, probably at Huntsville, Ala. Smaller monitoring sites will also beestablished in Germany, Hungary and Bosnia. Data will be sent first viaInmarsat satellites to Cambridge, Mass., then relayed to the other sites.   Intransit has assisted the United Nations in the past in monitoring theenforcement of economic sanctions in the former Yugoslavia. For example,oil barge traffic on the Danube River has been monitored by electronicmeans.   One of the main objectives of the Army is to make sure that a situationdoes not develop like the one in Desert Storm in which thousands ofcontainers had to be opened after they arrived to see what was in them.Electronic tags can be read by hand-held interrogators that will beprovided to soldiers. Commercially available tags are being used becausethey are inexpensive enough to use in large quantities. The Army is alsousing Qualcomm, a commercial cargo tracking system, to track some of thecargo bound for Bosnia. Qualcomm uses Ku-band satellites.   David Reed, chief of the Advanced Concepts Div. at the Volpe Center,said commercially available electronic tags were used in Somalia with greatsuccess. The Army already is using them at staging areas in the U.S. Whencargo arrives at Dover (Del.) AFB to be airlifted to Europe, it ismonitored by four interrogation units. Reed said palletized cargo bound forBosnia in military transports will be tagged, but may have to be retaggedat airports as it is repackaged for overland shipment.   TRAINS LEAVING Germany for the former Yugoslavia may have satellitecommunications equipment installed along with GPS receivers so theirpositions can be monitored from the U.S. or Western Europe. As a trainpasses an interrogator, it will be possible to check each tagged item.Illustration(s):Illustration: Diagram: U.S. Army will use commercially available electronictags on cargo containers bound for Bosnia.

PHILLIPS(WASHINGTON)Alaska's rough terrain, adverse weather and isolated, often crude airfieldspose serious aviation safety risks that can be minimized through a seriesof fundamental improvements, according to a U.S. National TransportationSafety Board report.   The chief safety issues identified by the NTSB's extensive review ofAlaskan aviation included weather reports and observations, airportconditions, flight and duty rest times, and heavy reliance on visual flightrules (VFR) by most commuter, air taxi and general aviation pilots.   OF THESE, TAKEOFF AND LANDING accidents and continued flight intoinstrument meteorological conditions were cited by the NTSB as the leadingcauses of crashes in the state, which has the largest number of airplanesper capita in the nation. Aviation is Alaska's main mode of transportationand is often the only lifeline available for many remote villages.   Although takeoff and landing accidents occur frequently, they result infewer deaths than flying into hazardous weather, the report said.   Because a majority of commuter and air taxi operators depends on VFRconditions to conduct their flights, they are under pressure to reach theirdestination and become vulnerable to the vagaries of deterioratingweather.   To improve flight safety in Alaska, the NTSB is urging the FAA to:  -- Implement by Dec. 31, 1997, a demonstration program to create alow-altitude, IFR route system in the Arctic and southeast regions of thestate that would more fully meet the needs of Alaska's air transportationindustry.   Such a network would include use of the Global Positioning System as asole source of navigation for both en route and non-precision instrumentapproaches. Many of Alaska's remote airfields lack any type of instrumentapproach capability.   The system also would use satellite-based voice communications as wellas Mode S transponders or VHF data link to provide air traffic controllerswith information on aircraft position and altitude. In addition,uncontrolled airspace would be used during the program to accommodate IFRdepartures, en route traffic and instrument approaches.   In another key part of the program, NTSB officials are urging the FAA topermit the use of turbine-powered, single-engine aircraft in commercialoperations under IFR, if they are equipped with redundant vacuum andelectrical subsystems. Current FAA rules prohibit use of single-engineaircraft to carry passengers under VFR or IFR conditions.   Although the agency already is studying the possibility of allowingsingle-engine, turbine-powered aircraft to conduct such operations withpaying passengers on board, the NTSB also is recommending that the FAAevaluate whether single-engine, piston-powered aircraft should be included.The majority of small aircraft flying in Alaska are powered byreciprocating engines, but a growing number of turboprop-powered aircraftare entering commercial service.  -- Determine the effect on safety of converting existing VFR operationsconducted under FAR Part 135 into IFR operations at remote or isolatedlanding sites. The FAA would consider expanding weather reportingfacilities at such locations, install automated weather reporting systems,or develop nonprecision instrument approaches at the sites and allowoperators to use them without the benefit of extensive weather data.  -- Require Part 135 operators to provide initial and recurrent trainingto pilots in aeronautical decision-making and judgment. The training wouldbe tailored specifically to that operator's environment. Commercialoperators also would be required to develop flight time duty limitations.  -- Assist the National Weather Service in providing graphical weatherinformation to pilots that is specific to Alaska, and distribute that datavia the Rural Alaska Television network, Direct User Access Terminal(DUAT), Alaska Public Television and the Internet.  -- Ensure that staffing at Alaska's Automated Flight Service Stationsare adequate and that problems associated with poor radio communicationscapability through remote outlets or navaids can be resolved.  -- Modify the Notice to Airmen system to permit dissemination ofunverified information, labeled as such, about airport and remote fieldconditions reported by official and unofficial aviation resources. Thereport also suggests that a training program be established that wouldpermit ``microphone-in-hand'' reports on airport conditions by Alaskaairport maintenance personnel and contract workers.Photograph(s):Photograph: Real-time reports of Alaskan airport conditions would reducelanding accidents.

Tramco has been performing modifications and other maintenance forAmerica West over the last two years.   Laid-off employees will receive about 35% of annual salary, and thosewith six years tenure will receive 56%.

VELOCCI, JR.(NEW YORK)Trans World Airlines Inc., while still no picture of health, appears to beon the path to a recovery scarcely imagined a year ago.Here's why:  -- Entering the industry's traditional January-March slow period, TWA hasa cash cushion of more than $300 million. That is nearly triple the amountthe company had in reserve in January.  -- TWA is one of only two full-service carriers in the U.S. that reducedits cost per available seat mile significantly in 1995, according toindustry analysts; Delta Air Lines is the other. Excluding subsidiaryoperations, TWA's cost per ASM at the end of the third quarter was 7.8cents, down from 8.3 in December, 1994.  -- Operating cash flow--the lifeblood of a business--has increasedsubstantially and is more than sufficient to cover the airline's debtobligations. In fact, the ratio of cash flow to interest and principalcoverage currently stands at its highest level in years. Prior to thisyear, TWA was scraping by.   ``The company's image has been tarnished for so long, I'm getting realenjoyment out of surprising all of the skeptics who thought we couldn'tpossibly survive, much less make money,'' Chief Financial Officer RobertPeiser said.   At the start of 1995, the airline projected a net loss of $237 millionfor the full year. Actual losses for the first nine months were about $200million, which means the airline is approximately on target with itsbusiness plan. For 1996, the airline expects to generate operating and netincome of $251 million and $95 million, respectively.   TWA has started to convert some skeptics into cautious optimists. ``It'sremarkable what the airline has accomplished,'' Furman Selz analyst RaymondNeidl said.  According to Michael K. Lowry's assessment, TWA ``has turned thecorner.'' ``Its financial condition is substantially better, liquidity isimproving, and passenger demand for TWA's product is firm,'' said thepresident of Aviation Forecasting & Economics Inc., in Lake Oswego, Ore.   While all of that may be true, there remain those who continue to lookupon TWA as still a largely unproven entity.   ``A rising tide lifts all ships, and a good deal of improvement at TWAis attributable to the favorable operating conditions, as well as thedemise of Continental Airlines' CalLite,'' Rene Shaker, an analyst atMoody's Investors Service, said. ``TWA still has significant challengesahead.''   One of those is Southwest Airlines' encroachment into St. Louis, TWA'slargest and most important domestic hub, she said. Another challenge isstrengthening the airline's international operations. Load factors areabout 12% higher than last year, but that part of TWA's business is widelyperceived as hobbled because it includes no route authority to London'sHeathrow Airport.   ``It's not that TWA can't make money from the international routes ithas in place now,'' First Boston analyst Paul Karos said. ``It's just thatnon-Heathrow routes tend to be lower-margin business, on average.''   THERE ALSO IS A LACK of understanding on just what it is that TWA hopesto become. ``Management needs to do a better job of defining the role theyenvision for the airline long-term,'' Shaker said. ``Fighting a battle forsurvival, which it seems to have won, and fighting for competitive positionare quite different,'' Shaker said.   Perhaps TWA's most pressing chore is increasing revenues. ''For now, thecarrier probably has done as much as it can to clean up its balance sheetand reduce debt service,'' Neidl said.   TWA management has put revenue enhancement at the top of its prioritylist and taken the action necessary to position the airline for substantialtop-line growth, starting in1996. A new computerized yield-managementsystem is expected to optimize the allocation of full-fare and discountedseats on all of TWA's daily flights. TWA is the last major U.S. carrier toadopt such a system, which is considered essential in today's competitiveenvironment.   TWA's 1994 revenues were about $3 billion. Neidl believes the carrier'syield-management system could increase that by about 3% or $100 millionannually--an estimate that Peiser said is reasonable.   The airline also is trying to address the seasonal swings in itsrevenues. TWA hopes to form a number of code-sharing alliances with othercarriers in the U.S. and in other countries. ``We have a good shot atseeing a number of them materialize in the near future,'' Peiser said.   Additionally, TWA has signed an agreements with a major tour operator,who has guaranteed to fill a large number of seats on flights bound forwarmer climate destinations. This will complement the carrier's efforts tofortify its presence in the Caribbean, Mexico and other parts of CentralAmerica, as well as seasonal increase in service to Florida.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT TWA is somewhat restricted in how fast it can moveinto or expand in markets where its greatest revenue opportunities mayexist. The carrier simply does not have enough aircraft. Management is inthe market for replacement aircraft and hopes to make an announcement soonconcerning its fleet plan.Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Trans World Airlines Inc.

Only one person was slightly injured during the evacuation following anemergency landing, but the aircraft incurred damage to its wings andlanding gear. The aircraft carried a crew of five and 72 passengers as itlanded shortly before 1 a.m. at Bradley at Windsor Locks, Conn., on Nov.12.   The mishap has drawn a high level of interest at the NTSB, which hasstarted looking at major incidents as closely as accidents in recent years.A full report on the incident should be completed by late spring or earlysummer. An NTSB investigator said ``a lot happened'' during the 70 sec.from the time the plane struck the trees until it came to a stop on therunway. The NTSB is still piecing together the course of events. There werereports of gusty winds and turbulence in the area at the time of theincident, but the NTSB is still evaluating data to see if wind shear was afactor.   The week after the incident American told its pilots to add 100 ft. tothe minimum descent altitude (MDA) on all non-precision approaches and toadd .5 mi. to the visibility minimums. An American official said thistemporary change applies to its operations worldwide while the companyevaluates all of the non-precision approaches in its route system.   The VOR approach to Runway 15 at Bradley calls for aircraft to pass afinal approach fix at 4.8 mi. from the runway (5 mi. DME from the BradleyVOR on the airfield) and descend from 2,000 ft. to the MDA of 1,080 ft.There is a ridge between the final approach fix and the runway that has anelevation of about 770 ft. with a stand of trees on it about 50 ft. tall.The MDA is calculated by adding 250 ft. to the 820 ft. obstacle elevationand then rounded up to a 20-ft. interval, to arrive at 1,080 ft.   The aircraft had descended from the final approach fix and flown almosthalf- way to the runway when the pilots received a ground proximity warningsystem ``sink rate'' alert just prior to striking the trees. The pilotswere unable to avert impact with the trees, but as the aircraft skimmed thetree tops they were able to advance the power and initiate a go-around toavoid crashing in the wooded area. An on-board wind shear alert soundedafter the aircraft hit the trees and the NTSB is studying this.   THE PILOTS DID NOT REALIZE they had struck the trees even though theyheard a loud noise, or that the encounter with the trees had dented andtorn holes in the flaps and slats. Both wing tips had been hit, compositematerial had been shattered and the navigation lights were broken. Brushand tree limbs were found in the wheel well and a landing gear door hadbeen torn off. The horizontal stabilizer had incurred some damage, perhapsfrom flying wood debris, but the plane was still flying.   The pilots began to retract the gear and flaps but then elected to landinstead when they spotted the runway lights. The Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219engines were not producing full power and NTSB investigators found evidencethat the right engine caught fire at some point after impact with thetrees. It has not been determined whether the right engine failed.   When the pilots saw the runway, they selected gear down and flaps 40deg. The gear and flaps worked, even though some of the hydraulic linesrunning through the wheel well had been broken. The aircraft was equippedwith a 60-channel flight data recorder, which is providing good data.   THE AIRCRAFT STILL HAD difficulty making the runway. Workmen had removedsome trees from the approach end of Runway 15 the week before the incident.Those trees could have posed an additional hazard on this emergencyapproach. The MD-83 wiped out a whole row of T-shaped ILS antennas as itapproached the threshold and then touched down short of the runway in theoverrun area and bounced once before rolling 4,000 ft. to a full stop. Thebrakes were still functioning. The crew and passengers then evacuated theplane.   The NTSB is trying to determine why the aircraft was about 260 ft. lowwhen it struck the stand of trees on a ridge and cut a path about 250 ft.long and 100 ft. wide. The aircraft broke off mostly 2-in.-dia. branches upto 15 ft. below the top of the trees before climbing away from theobstruction. Some larger branches also were broken off.   Investigators are examining what procedures the pilots used in settingaltimeters and maintaining MDA, what role turbulence may have played andwhether the height of the ridge line was correctly surveyed. Anotherquestion is whether the crew stopped the descent before striking thetrees.   The National Weather Service at the airport was reporting winds of 170deg. at 25 kt. gusting to 40 kt. about 5 min. before the MD-83 landed. AnLLWAS alert did sound in another quadrant of the airport about 2 min. priorto the tree strike incident.   THE WEATHER OBSERVATION at Bradley 5 min. before the plane landed alsonoted cloud cover of 1,700 ft. scattered and 2,800 ft. overcast withbarometric pressure falling rapidly. The visibility of 3 mi. in moderaterain was sufficient to fly the VOR Runway 15 approach. The tower was closedbecause a window had been blown loose. A air traffic controller who wasassisting repairmen responded to a radio call from the American Airlinesflight prior to the incident and advised the crew of the winds and theLLWAS alert, and that the runway was clear.   The NTSB is looking at the weather information provided to the crew andhow up-to-date it was as well as the altimeter data received from BostonCenter and ACARS. A special American Airlines procedure for having pilotsset their altimeters so they read zero on the runway has been examined bythe NTSB but is not an area of interest in the investigation. All threealtimeters on the MD-83 have been tested and found to be working properly.   An international aviation industry group led by the Flight SafetyFoundation, with ICAO involvement, has been trying to have the waynon-precision approaches are designed changed to avoid the potential forcontrolled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT). The CFIT task force would also likeaircraft to descend gradually on these approaches as if they were on an ILSglidepath.   American completed temporary repairs and flew the aircraft to itsmaintenance base in Tulsa, Okla. The engines have been torn down; therewas heavy damage to the right engine and the rotating parts in the leftengine were out of alignment.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NCRASH TRIGGERS REVIEW OF AMRFAA launches inquiry as NTSB weighs review of training at American, EaglecarriersBy:JAMES T. McKENNA(MELBOURNE, FLA.)U.S. officials are weighing an inquest into pilot training at AmericanAirlines and its regional affiliates in the wake of a 757 crash thatappears to have been caused in part by poor cockpit discipline.   Senior National Transportation Safety Board officials believe the Dec.20 crash of American Flight 965 into a mountain near Cali, Colombia,warrants a probe of training at American's Flight Academy. American and itsfour American Eagle affiliates train pilots there.   The FAA has begun a review of American's operating procedures andtraining with the airline and its pilots union, the Allied Pilots Assn.   The Boeing 757-223's flight data and cockpit voice recorders were flownat the Colombian government's request to the NTSB's laboratory inWashington. U.S. and Colombian investigators there reviewed 30 min. of datafrom the digital Sundstrand Data Control 980-4100 FDR and transcribed 30min. 36 sec. of data from the Fairchild A-100 CVR.   According to Capt. German Duarte, a Colombian investigator, the recorderdata sets contained no indications that the pilots of Flight 965 performedtheir descent checklist or an arrival/approach procedures briefing.   The pilots may have been confused about navigation aids used duringtheir approach to Runway 19 at Cali's Alfonso Bonilla Aragon InternationalAirport, he said, adding that they may have botched an ``escape maneuver''as their aircraft neared the San Jose mountain.   The NTSB and FAA are only assisting in the Flight 965 investigation,which is being run by Colombia's civil aviation authority. Their focus ontraining at American and the American Eagle carriers stems from the factthat the crash just south of Buga, Colombia, is the latest in a string ofAmerican-affiliated accidents.   THE BUGA CRASH, IN WHICH 163 persons on board were killed, was only thesecond fatal accident involving an American Airlines aircraft in 16 years.But it was the fourth accident in 14 months and the second in just 39 daysinvolving American or American Eagle crews.   ``It appears that [the Colombian] accident was entirely within thecockpit,'' one U.S. official involved with the investigation told AVIATIONWEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY. Added to the string of other accidents, ``that's ahighly unusual rate of training-related events.''   The NTSB already has launched a major investigation of an Americanflight that ripped 100 ft. through treetops before landing at BradleyInternational Airport in Connecticut (see p. 44).   Flight 965 departed Miami with 167 persons on board, including sixBogota-based cabin crewmembers, Capt. Nicholas Tafuri and First Officer DonWilliams. Air traffic controllers at Cali lost radio contact with theaircraft at 9:38 p.m. Duarte gave the following description of events:   Tafuri, working the radios, contacted approach control as Flight 965descended through 20,000 ft. about 63 mi. north of Cali. The controllersaid the flight was ``cleared direct to Cali VOR, descend and maintainone-five thousand.''   Tafuri, who had more than 10,000 hr. of flying time and more than 2,000hr. in the 757, acknowledged the clearance.   Two minutes later, the controller radioed that winds at the airport werecalm and asked whether Flight 965 could approach Runway 19.   ``Yes, sir,'' Tafuri said. ``We'll need a lower altitude right away,though.''   The controller then cleared the flight ``to the VOR DME approach runwayone-niner, ROZO number one arrival. Report Tulua VOR.''   ``We'll report the VOR, thank you, sir.''   Cali approach reiterated, ``Report Tulua,'' which the crewacknowledged.   The pilots then consulted their approach plate publications anddiscussed the navaids to be used in the ROZO 1 arrival and their positionrelative to Tulua VOR. They then asked if they could fly direct to the ROZOnondirectional radio beacon north of the airport and execute the arrivalprocedure.   ``Affirmative, direct ROZO one and then runway one-niner, the windscalm,'' the approach controller responded.   After the crew acknowledged that, the controller said, ``Affirmative,report Tulua and twenty-one miles, five thousand feet.'' The crew agreed.   Duarte said the FDR indicates that at a point south of the Tulua VOR,the pilots selected that VOR, code ULQ, in the flight management system.The aircraft then turned left for about 90 sec., to an easterly heading.   As the descent continued, the autopilot was switched to the headingselect mode and the aircraft entered a right turn to the southwest.   The 757's ground-proximity warning system (GPWS) issued a ``Terrain''mode warning, and called out ``Pull Up!'' repeatedly for 9 sec., until theCVR tape ended. FDR data indicated that the pilots initiated a GPWS escapemaneuver, increasing engine power and pitching the nose up, 2 sec. afterthe first aural warning. The stickshaker activated during this maneuver.   FDR data also indicate that the flight spoilers, which had been deployedduring the descent, remained extended until impact, Duarte said. Theaircraft hit near the top of the 12,000-ft. mountain 12 mi. east of itsdesired approach path and 38 mi. north of Cali.

At the time of takeoff into falling snow, JFK ATIS was reporting windsfrom 330 deg. at 11 kt. and a 2,000-ft. RVR. According to NTSB preliminaryaccident data, the pilot of Flight No. 41 reported control difficultyduring the takeoff roll, then aborted takeoff on the 11,352-ft. runway atan airspeed ``under 80 kt.'' Markings indicate the aircraft initiallydeparted the runway to the left, 1,200 ft. from the start of the roll. The747 continued to veer left, then fully departed Runway 4L 2,100 ft. fromthe beginning of the roll. The aircraft, with about 102,000 lb. of fuel onboard, hit an electrical conduit structure, which tore off the No. 4JT9D-7A engine.   The aircraft came to rest 4,800 ft. from the start of the roll, 800 ft.to the left of runway centerline in a nose-down position, its nosegear andright main gear collapsed. Portions of struts had pushed through theforward cabin, lifting seats 2-3 ft.   There were no fatalities, and about 35 minor injuries were reportedamong the 445 passengers and 15 crew, all of whom were evacuated safely.   The 747 had been deiced twice prior to departure, and the NTSB said theaircraft was ``well within'' departure safety limits following its seconddeicing. Tower Air Chairman and CEO Morris Nachtomi said on the day of theaccident ice and snow accumulation on the runway had caused the aircraft toskid.   The NTSB said it is encountering difficulty reading FDR data due tosoftware problems. But the safety board expects this to be resolved andresults of the investigation released within 3-4 months.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NBOEING TO EXPAND 737 `ROLLS' PROGRAMBy:EDWARD H. PHILLIPS(WASHINGTON)Boeing's special ``rolls team'' is completing its probe into uncommandedrolls involving 737-series aircraft as company engineers analyze new waketurbulence data pertinent to the crash of a USAir 737-300 in September,1994.   Between April and August, 1995, Boeing received reports of 20 incidentsfrom U.S. airlines involving unexpected rolls in the 737. Most of theincidents could not be explained by equipment faults or failures associatedwith autopilot or yaw damper systems, Jean A. McGrew, 737 chief projectengineer, said.   To address those incidents, Boeing formed the team in August todetermine why the rolls were occurring. Initial analysis indicated theevents ``were clearly different'' than typical anomalies, he said. Usinginformation from each aircraft's flight data recorder (FDR), the teamreviewed the events and conducted an analysis of the 737's lateral controlsystems in an attempt to find a cause. By comparing FDR traces, a patterngradually emerged, McGrew said.   In each case, during the initial upset 50% of the traces showed similarcharacteristics, such as small increases in airspeed accompanied by rapidroll rates and significant changes in vertical load factor, particularlynear peak roll angle. Mechanical failures typically do not produce suchchanges in load factor, according to McGrew.   Roll rates, for example, initially were slow but increased to valueswell above the 6-7 deg./sec. normally induced by a system fault such as anautopilot hardover. In addition, not all of the aircraft rolled in the samedirection, he said.   When the traces were compared with those of five 737s known to haveencountered wake turbulence, the similarities were ``remarkable,'' McGrewsaid. The team determined that at least seven upsets probably were causedby wake turbulence, five were caused by equipment failures, and anotherthree involved some degree of interaction by the flight crew.   As a result of the team's work with FDR traces, Boeing essentially hasdeveloped a process to discern between an in-service roll event caused by afailure and one caused by wake turbulence. McGrew expects Boeing willexpand the program this year to include other U.S. airlines and foreigncarriers operating the 737.   Exactly what role wake vortices played in the loss of control of USAirFlight 427 remains largely unknown. Boeing engineers expect analysis of newdata on vortex encounters will help them better understand the positions ofprimary flight controls after the initial upset occurred.   The USAir 737 was flying at 6,000 ft. about 4.5 n.m. behind a Delta AirLines 727-200 when it apparently encountered wake turbulence from the leadaircraft during initial approach to Pittsburgh. The ensuing loss of controlled to a crash that killed all 132 people on board.   U.S. National Transportation Safety Board officials are particularlyinterested in movement of the aircraft's rudder. Accident analysisindicates the rudder was deflected up to 21 deg. during the upset event andremained displaced until impact with the ground. After 15 months ofintensive investigation, neither the NTSB nor Boeing has been able todetermine what could have caused the rudder to move.   Boeing engineers are still extracting data from wake vortex researchflights conducted last September (AW&ST Oct. 2, 1995, p. 33).   The chief purpose of the flights was to define more precisely thelocation of the 727's vortices in relation to the accident aircraft.   Engineers can then calculate aerodynamic coefficients of the airplanewithin the vortex flow field to help verify accuracy of a distributed liftmodel for the 737-300 developed by Boeing, James W. Kerrigan said. He islead aerodynamics engineer, 737-series stability and control, for BoeingCommercial Airplane Co.   Prior to the flights in September, engineers lacked data from airbornewake encounters to support results generated by the model.Photograph(s):Photograph: Boeing will expand its roll program to include additional U.S.airlines operating 737-series aircraft.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NPRODUCTION EXPANSION HERALDS MARKET UPTURN(SEATTLE)Boeing will increase production by four transports a month to 24 by early1997 to accommodate increased sales and help recover from a 10-weekmachinists' strike. This will be the first production rate increase forBoeing in three years.   The shift signals the long-awaited upswing of the internationalcommercial transport market. Boeing's deliveries during the strike fellbehind by about 30 aircraft.   The production spool-up affects almost all Boeing transport lines. Buildrate for the 737 narrow-body will increase to 8.5 a month from seven permonth by the fourth quarter of 1996. This reverses a previous plan to dropproduction to five airplanes a month by April. The manufacturing rate ofBoeing's flagship 747 also will increase to 3.5 monthly from two byyear-end.   Construction of wide-body 767s will increase from 3.5 to four a monthduring 1996. The new Boeing 777, now being built at a rate of 3.5/month,will increase to five a month in early 1997.   ALTHOUGH THE MANUFACTURING rate of the 757 still will decline in 1996from four to three transports a month, the move to the lower rate has beenpostponed from June to September.   Major orders for Boeing wide-body aircraft by Saudi Arabian Airlines andSingapore Airlines helped drive the production expansion. Boeing also hasbeen successful at selling its new ``next-generation'' line of 737s. Thisincludes a year-end deal with China Airlines for six 737-800s and nineoptions potentially worth $750 million.   During 1995, the Seattle-based manufacturer announced new orders for 261transports valued at $19 billion. This more than doubled the previousyear's total of 120 new orders worth $7.76 billion.   The 777 has been a strong performer for Boeing, garnering about 230orders and commitments. Since its October, 1990, launch, the 777 has won an80% market share, according to top Boeing managers. The modernized 737-600/700/800 series has logged almost as many sales, for 220 units, in thelittle over two years it has been available.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NJAS GETS MD-90(LOS ANGELES)McDonnell Douglas has delivered an MD-90 to Japan Air System--the firstreceipt of the new derivative by a customer outside the U.S. JAS plans touse the aircraft, and nine other MD-90s it has on order, in domesticservice, which is scheduled to begin in April.

PHILLIPS(WASHINGTON)Airline industry officials are urging Congress to be cautious aboutlegislation regarding accessibility of pilot employment records because ofserious privacy and legal issues.   During testimony before the House aviation subcommittee in December, anumber of senior airline and air taxi industry representatives toldlawmakers they generally favor at least limited access to a pilot'spersonnel records as part of a pre-employment program.   OFFICIALS WITHIN the airline industry support access to personnelrecords by prospective employers, but are concerned about ``thorny privacy,defamation, negligence and contract interference issues'' that must be``thoroughly explored and resolved'' to protect both the airlines andpilots, Edward Merlis, senior vice president of the Air Transport Assn.,said. The ATA represents most major U.S. airlines including cargocarriers.   ``It's a subject which must be addressed,'' Randolph Babbitt, presidentof the Air Line Pilots Assn., said. ALPA represents more than 44,000 pilotsat 37 airlines. Babbitt considers recommendations made by the U.S. NationalTransportation Safety Board as ``too narrow'' in scope.   Safety board officials made the recommendations after its investigationinto the crash of an American Eagle regional transport in December, 1994.The captain's previous employer was not required to transfer his records tothe American Eagle carrier. Those records revealed previous deficiencies inthe pilot's flying performance that were unknown by American Eagle.   The NTSB wants standardized information about pilot qualifications to bemaintained and shared among airlines as well as independent trainingagencies such as FlightSafety International. An airline's hiring andtraining practices currently are not required to meet any standardspecifications except those mandated by the Federal Aviation Regulations.As a result, hiring practices are ``extremely diverse,'' Babbitt said.   To strengthen control of pilot records, ALPA is calling for a programsimilar to one proposed in 1992 by a Transportation Dept. study thatsuggested more stringent hiring and training procedures as well asformulation of performance-based standards for entry-level pilots. Tougherpre-employment screening, standardized training and monitoring programswould help maintain ``the high quality of airline pilots, both now and inthe future,'' Babbitt said.   HE WANTS THE NTSB to conduct a special study of hiring and trainingrules within the U.S. airline industry, followed by an FAA/industrycoalition charged with implementing new changes.   The National Air Transportation Assn. (NATA) supports a bill introducedlast month by Sen. John McCain (R.-Ariz.) that would provide some degree ofliability protection for airlines releasing pilot records. The billessentially would permit the transfer of a pilot's existing records toanother airline if the pilot had applied for a job with the secondcarrier.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NIATA'S AVIATION ENGLISH COURSE COMES TO CHINA(HONG KONG)China's aviation establishment has asked the International Air TransportAssn. to conduct a major aviation English language skills course as part ofthe country's drive to meet world air safety standards.   Training would be given to some 2,000 pilots and as yet an undeterminednumber of air traffic controllers. It would be modeled after a similarprogram that IATA set up three years ago in Prague for Eastern Europeanairlines. Training will be in language skills only; IATA is not teachingpiloting or ATC skills.   THE REQUEST COMES FROM the Civil Aviation Administration of China withAir China's pilots in mind as the first students. A lack of English skillsis regarded as one of China's most persistent problems (AW&ST Oct. 2, 1995,p. 50).   Director General Pierre Jeanniot said IATA and the CAAC also willestablish a joint-venture data processing center to bring China's billingand settlement services up to international standards. The Chinese hadinitially undertaken the task on their own, but realized they werereinventing the wheel and will now turn to proven IATA software to make thetask easier.   IATA will provide its first training for the Chinese aviation sector toa group of 250 travel agents, who will learn accounting procedures forinterlining of tickets as well as other tasks. Jeanniot said there was apotential need for 10,000 Chinese travel agents to be trained.   The three Chinese IATA members--Air China, China Southern and ChinaEastern--will send managers to Geneva for courses in various businesstasks, such as yield management and weight balancing.   Jeanniot, who recently visited Beijing to discuss cooperation with theCAAC, said IATA will begin translating its technical documents intoChinese. The first will be IATA's Dangerous Goods Manual.   Late last year, IATA began reviewing China Northern's application tobecome its fourth Chinese member airline. A fifth member--probably ChinaSouthwest--could be admitted during the next year.   Jeanniot criticized the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for its tightgrip on civil aviation operations. He particularly targeted the PLA'scontrol of the nation's airspace and sale of aviation fuel, which is twiceas high as world averages.   ``There is a need for a political decision'' at a high level to reducethe role of the military in civil aviation policy, he said.   Jeanniot praised China's efforts to improve air safety. But he notedthat in many areas the effort is uncoordinated. For instance, airlines arenot permitted to discuss airport expansion programs with planners.   ``A customer-driven industry concept doesn't exist'' in China, hecommented.Photograph(s):Photograph: IATA will help 2,000 Chinese pilots master aviation English.

McKENNA(MELBOURNE, FLA.)Delta Air Lines and Lockheed Martin are teaming to close what they say is agap in maintenance services for L-1011 aircraft in North America.   The airline, which is among the world's largest L-1011 operators, hassigned an agreement to join with Lockheed Martin to provide comprehensivemaintenance, engineering and parts support for more than 200 L-1011s inservice in the world today. Lockheed built the aircraft in the 1970s.   The partnership, the terms of which will be defined over the nextseveral months, should allow Delta to boost its financial performance. Thecarrier would gain additional revenue from contracts to service L-1011s forother carriers. It also would be able to spread the cost of performingdamage-tolerance assessments of airframe repairs to its fleet of 56 L-1011sover a larger base that included other carriers' aircraft.   Lockheed Martin, in turn, would be able to add Delta's shop, engineeringand spares capabilities to the global L-1011 support structure. It alsowould be able to market its overhaul and maintenance centers as a``one-stop shop'' for L-1011 services.   AN ALLIANCE OF DELTA and Lockheed Martin ``would fill a major void inNorth America for L-1011 maintenance and support services,'' Dan Patterson,president of Lockheed Martin Aircraft Center in Greenville, N.C., said.Patterson recently took over at the former Lockheed Aeromod Center afterthree years of running NASA's space shuttle launch operations as head ofLockheed Space Operations Co.   Lockheed Martin officials had been concerned that their limited aircraftsupport structure would be strained by the migration of L-1011s from majoroperators in North America and Asia to smaller operators in Asia, Africaand Latin America.   Trans World Airlines and Cathay Pacific, both carriers with extensiveengineering and maintenance capabilities, have begun selling off theirL-1011s. The smaller airlines likely to buy such aircraft may not havesubstantial engineering and maintenance operations or the interest andmoney to develop such operations. They would require a greater level ofengineering, maintenance and spares-production services than the currentL-1011 operators.   That demand would tax the existing L-1011 support structure. Theperception that that structure is overburdened might cause used-aircraftcustomers to favor McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, which enjoy a wider and morerobust support structure.   The result would be a rising number of parked L-1011s and decliningsupport-service revenue for the company.   In their search for more support business, Lockheed Martinrepresentatives decided to check on Delta's interest in farming out L-1011maintenance to the center in Greenville.   Contrary to ``outsourcing'' that work, ``Delta was interested in'in-sourcing,' bringing more third-party L-1011 work in house,'' RobertStephenson said. The director of strategic and technical development at theGreenville center, Stephenson participated in those initial talks.   When the talks concluded, he said, both the Delta and Lockheed Martinofficials realized that the answer was for the companies to join inpursuing L-1011 maintenance work.   ``An alliance takes advantage of each other's inherent strengths,'' RayValeika, Delta's vice president of technical operations, said. ``Together,we have all the technical skill to keep those airplanes flying. It's aniche for us that no one else can move into.''   Valeika and Stephenson are used to working with each other, havingserved together as engineers for Pan American World Airways for a number ofyears.   As envisioned now, Lockheed Martin would concentrate on L-1011 airframemaintenance and modifications, including freighter conversions. Thecompany's Aircraft Service Co. in Ontario, Calif., which hold asupplemental type certificate for an L-1011 freighter conversion, wouldreceive additional work under the alliance. But most of the work would goto Greenville.   Delta would overhaul and maintain alliance customers' Rolls-Royce RB211engines, as well as aircraft component refurbishment and shop support.   Greenville already handles some L-1011 airframe work, ``but thecustomers are pretty much on their own for the engine and component workright now,'' Stephenson said. The advantage of working with Delta is thatwork could be trucked from Greenville to Atlanta in 2.5 hr. and be doneunder one contract, he said.   Delta will continue to do all its L-1011 airframe and powerplantmaintenance work in house, Valeika said, and may expand the wingmodification work it does now to include alliance customers' aircraft.   The partners envision a range of services for customers, from a one-timeoverhaul to complete turn-key maintenance services for an airline.Stephenson said they are already at work contacting potential customers.Photograph(s):Photograph: By teaming with Lockheed Martin, Delta could spread the cost ofsupporting its L-1011s over a larger base and generate more revenue fromits maintenance unit.BILL HOUGHCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NTHAAD TEST FAILURE LINKED TO SOFTWARE ERRORU.S. Army and Lockheed Martin engineers suspect a computer software errorcaused the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) missile to stray offcourse initially and miss a Storm target during an attempted intercept onDec. 13.

Major carriers added 2,300 new cockpit crewmembers to their rosters, orabout 1,000 more pilots than in 1994 and at least four times more than in1993. That year, only 466 new pilots landed jobs with airlines, accordingto AIR Inc., an Atlanta-based company specializing in airline careerdevelopment.   New, entry-level airlines hired less than 100 pilots in 1995, comparedwith 288 in 1994.

Benning, Ga.,to Egypt for a mass parachute drop.   The aircraft flew recently from Lawson Army Airfield (Ga.) to a dropzone near Cairo (loading troops photo center right). The 14.5-hr. flightcovered 6,400 naut. mi. and involved refueling from a KC-10 enroute (topright). The C-17s descended to low level to drop members of the 3rdBattalion, 75th U.S. Army Ranger Regiment from 800 ft. above the ground(photo below). The soldiers were participating in Bright Star '95, aU.S./Egyptian exercise. The C-17s were from the 437th Military Airlift Wingat Charleston AFB, S.C.   Col. Jack Pledger, deputy director of plans at Air Mobility Commandheadquarters, said this small scale exercise shows how a larger number ofC-17s could air drop an Army brigade-size unit. He noted that six C-17salso demonstrated this capability over the summer. The first four C-17s inthe formation dropped equipment while the next two carried paratroopers.   The C-17 is also designed to fly into austere airfields for airlandoperations and is now being used in Bosnia. All 120 of the aircraft will beequipped with AAR-47 missile attack warning systems and ALE-47 flaredispensers for self-protection.   Pledger said the Air Force has received 23 C-17s and may be receiving asmany as 15 per year if plans for an accelerated multiyear acquisition areapproved. The Air Force was directed by the Defense Acquisition Board tofind the most favorable production rate. Pledger said the Air Force expectssome savings if the plan is approved since parts can be purchased in largequantities to reduce costs. Also, five production C-17s used in the flighttest program are being reconfigured for delivery to operational squadrons.If the accelerated plan is approved, the last of 120 C-17s would bedelivered in 2003.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NF/A-18 DROP MODEL TESTS TO BEGINBy:EDWARD H. PHILLIPSLANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER, VA.Flight tests of an F/A-18E/F drop model scheduled to begin soon willprovide important data on stall, post-stall and spin recoverycharacteristics applicable to the full-scale aircraft's upcoming flighttest program.   Mark A. Croom, drop model program manager at Langley's Vehicle DynamicsBranch, expects the first drop to occur in March or April. The model willbe flown chiefly to explore the low-speed envelope, with a particularemphasis on stall and post-stall regimes. The flights will also reliablypredict a vehicle's behavior during large amplitude or highly dynamicconditions such as spin entry, he said.   Plans call for making about 50 flights with the model during thethree-year program. The majority of drops will be made from 12,000 ft. orless, and will last about 90 sec. Upgraded display and control consoleswill allow the model's flight crew to reconfigure the control system ``onthe fly,'' thereby maximizing the amount of research achieved per flight.   In addition to being 25% larger than the F/A-18C/D, the F/A-18E/F designincorporates subtle changes that may cause ``significant differences inhigh-alpha flight dynamic behavior,'' Croom said. He cited the aircraft'smodified wing leading-edge extensions, for example, which may altervortical flows and thereby change spin recovery characteristics comparedwith the original design.   A smaller model of the F/A-18E/F has been tested in Langley's 20-ft.Vertical Spin Tunnel to help determine developed spin and spin recoverycharacteristics. The drop model flights will augment that work, accordingto Croom.   A NONPOWERED, 22%-SCALE F/A-18E/F drop model, which has a wing span ofnearly 10 ft., has been completed by Newport News, Va.-based DynamicEngineering Inc. and delivered to Langley for systems integration. Duringthe next few months, the 400-lb. vehicle will be fitted with 400 lb. ofinstrumentation and other special equipment, increasing its drop weight toabout 900 lb. That includes ballast to give the model correct masscharacteristics for scaling.   NASA researchers also want to use information from the drop flights torefine the program's aerodynamic data base, and to formulate control lawsdesigned to enhance handling qualities of the full-scale airplane.   NASA's F/A-18E/F drop model program began about three years ago whendesign of the U.S. Air Force F-22 advanced tactical fighter and NavyF/A-18E/F were well underway. Plans originally called for testing an F-22drop model, but funding was inadequate and the program was terminated.Although the Vehicle Dynamics Branch would prefer to conduct at least twodrop model programs simultaneously, limited money permits only one.   Langley recently concluded drop tests of an X-31 model after conducting25 flights during a two-year period. The longest of these was 128 sec. Twofinal drops were made last autumn to evaluate differential action of thecanards for yaw control at high angles of attack. Using differentialpressure along the fuselage forebody, the canards ``proved as effective asthrust vectoring'' to control directional movement, according to Croom.   For the final flight, most of the aircraft's vertical stabilizer hadbeen removed to gather data to validate wind tunnel studies. Without thestabilizer, directional control was lost at about 25 deg. angle of attack,he said.   In addition to the upcoming F/A-18E/F flights, the Advanced ResearchProjects Agency (ARPA) is considering a follow-on, drop model program forthe X-31 or another aircraft type chiefly to evaluate flow control devicesactivated by microelectronic machines. ARPA sponsored the X-31 flights andis involved, along with the U.S. Navy, in the F/A-18E/F drop modelprogram.   To improve launch capability for the upcoming flights, Langleyresearchers have modified a Bell UH-1 aircraft by installing landing gearskids that are higher and wider than the original unit. Previously, modelswere suspended from an outrigger-type mount on the right side of theaircraft. Although the system worked, it caused pilot workload to escalatesignificantly during takeoff and landing.   THE NEW SKIDS, WHICH WERE obtained by NASA from storage at Davis-MonthanAFB, had been installed on a small number of specially modified UH-1helicopters operated by the U.S. Army. They allow drop models to be carriedbeneath the helicopter's fuselage and directly on its center of gravity,which greatly improves launch operations as well as safety during takeoffand landing, Croom said. A zero-impulse bolt (ZIB) is used to release themodel. The ZIB imparts virtually no force to the model during release.   Langley researchers plan to conduct the F/A-18E/F drop flights from theisland side of NASA/Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Va.Previously, all drop model tests were based at Langley's Plum Tree TestRange in a wetland region near the research center.   During the next three years, Croom expects to install two small turbojetengines in the F/A-18E/F drop model for a series of powered flights. Eachengine would be rated at about 280-lb. static thrust.   To learn the water recovery techniques necessary at Wallops, NASA hasconferred with the U.S. Navy's program to launch and recover BQM-74 targetdrones near Virginia Beach, Va. The key challenge for Croom's team,however, was to learn how to seal models properly to prevent salt waterintrusion.   Tests using the X-31 model demonstrated that the relatively ``soft''water landings caused little or no damage to the vehicle. The F/A-18E/Fmodel will feature special salt water sensors designed to sever parachutelines quickly upon landing. Rapid separation of the risers preventsunderwater inflation of the 63-ft.-dia. parachute, and subsequent sinkingof the $1-million vehicle. nPhotograph(s):Photograph: Researchers removed most of the vertical stabilizer from theX-31 model to conduct tests involving directional stability.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NDEFENDER CERTIFIED(LONDON)Pilatus Britten-Norman has been granted a full type certificate from theU.K.'s Civil Aviation Authority for its new BN2T-4S Defender 4000, whichrecently completed a 150-hr. flight test program.

These includerappelling (photo, below left), rescue (photo, lower right) and precisionforest fire water drops with a 240-gal. external bucket (photo, upperright).   The port city of Niigata is located on the western edge of centralJapan's narrow coastal plain and is hemmed in by mountains as near as32-mi. away and up to 7,000-ft. high. The mountain scenery is a magnet fornature lovers and the Niigata City-based helicopter unit is called toevacuate injured hikers. It also is equipped to perform coastal search andrescue and will provide back-up emergency services to the 1996 WinterOlympic Games, to be held in neighboring Nagano Prefecture.   Entering service in April, the 11,700-lb. gross weight S-76B quicklydistinguished itself when torrential rains in July caused flash floodingand landslides. In the storm's aftermath, hundreds of residents in NiigataPrefecture were isolated without electrical power, according to MakotoWatanabe, unit commander.   In one 5-hr. period the S-76B evacuated 212 people, making 19 roundtrips in difficult weather. The twin-engine helicopter operated from anadvanced site complete with refueling capability to avoid ferry time to itsNiigata Airport base.   The helicopter flew several other missions over the five days followingthe sm, Watanabe said. These included rapid identification of highwaydamage, downed bridges and power lines. The S-76B also provided timelytransportation of disaster response experts, relief teams and emergencysupplies. Community needs quickly were identified where conventionalcommunications links were down.   Niigata's S-76B is configured with a rescue hoist and provisions forfour litter positions, Nightsun searchlight, public address speaker andsnow skis for winter operations. It is flown by contract pilots from AeroAsahi Corp., Japan's largest private helicopter operator.   A second S-76B, ordered at the same time, is operational with YamanashiPrefecture, located at the base of Mt. Fuji. It is equipped with atelevision communications broadcast system and forward-looking infrared(Flir) camera. In July, it rescued an injured teenager in mountainousterrain at an altitude of 9,400-ft.   Niigata unit operations normally are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. daily.Aircraft currently are flown single-pilot, with a mechanic seated in thecopilot's position as a safety coordinator and observer. The addition ofnight flights is under study but would require two-pilot crews. Typicalduty staffing includes the aircraft captain, an engineer, a mechanic, adispatcher and four to six specially trained rescue crew.   Niigata Prefecture purchased the S-76B with a subsidy provided byJapan's Ministry of Home Affairs.   Both helicopters are powered by twin Pratt & Whitney PT6B-36turboshafts.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NMESA MARKETS AGGRESSIVELYBy:COMPILED BY PAUL PROCTORMESA, ARIZ., IS TACKLING ITS BASE-CLOSING head-on with an internationalmarketing campaign.

The CL-415s would be equipped with a radar, Flir and searchlights, butthey also could be configured to perform their traditional fire-fightingrole.   The aircraft can scoop 6,100 liters (1,600 gal.) in 12 sec. from a lakeor ocean, drop the water on a fire and then repeat the process. Theaircraft also can convert the water to foam by injecting chemicals intoit.   A CL-415 flew daily exhibitions last month at the Langkawi InternationalMaritime and Aerospace Exhibition in Malaysia after already appearing inTurkey, Greece, Lebanon, Syria, Cyprus and the Dubai air show. Its next airshow appearance will be in February at Asian Aerospace `96 in Singapore.   Bombardier's five-month, 21-nation tour is part of a multimillion-dollareffort to demonstrate the capabilities of the aircraft in variousroles--including fire-fighting, maritime surveillance, search-and-rescueand environmental monitoring. The tour will also take the 415 to Indonesia,the Philippines, Japan and Taiwan. Bombardier is leasing the demonstratoraircraft from the province of Quebec, Canada, and has repainted it. SISAM,a subsidiary of Alitalia, is providing the flight crews. SISAM operates afleet of CL-415s and CL-215s in Italy.   Ray Mathieu, marketing director for Canadair's Amphibious Aircraft Div.,said the CL-415 demonstrations at Langkawi were made to the MaritimeEnforcement Coordinating Center and the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The airforce would operate the aircraft for the coordinating center if CL-415s areacquired.   Japanese authorities became interested in the airplane after the Kobeearthquake, which caused disastrous fires last January. Mathieu saidMitsubishi Heavy Industries is now assisting Bombardier in marketing the415 in Japan. This arrangement grew out of Mitsubishi's relationship as arisk-sharing partner on the Global Express and de Havilland Dash 8. CL-215Tturboprop- and CL-215 piston-powered aircraft have been leased in recentyears by several U.S. states.   The CL-215Ts are turboprop aircraft created in a retrofit program inwhich piston engines were replaced. These aircraft do not have the glasscockpit of the newly manufactured CL-415. Two CL-215Ts were evaluated fortwo months in 1994 during fire season by the Los Angles County Fire Dept.,and two more are being evaluated now.   The two CL-215Ts on duty in Los Angeles can be airborne 5 min. after afire alarm is received and are being used primarily to fight wild fires inurban areas. Representatives from the Japan National Fire ResearchInstitute recently observed the 215Ts fighting fires in the Los Angelesarea.   Darrell Higuchi, deputy chief of the Los Angeles County Fire Dept., saidthe county probably will continue to lease aircraft each year for 60-90days during brush fire season when the Santa Ana winds are a factor. Thereare many bodies of water in the county, as well as the nearby ocean, wherethe aircraft can scoop water. About 80% have boat traffic, but localagreements call for lakes and reservoirs to be cleared for scoopingoperations if necessary. Higuchi said the 215Ts make 6-20 airdrops of waterper hour on a fire.   Bombardier also worked with the Swedish Coast Guard last summer todemonstrate a CL-215 in the dual role of fire-fighting and coastal patrol,with the intent of Sweden looking at the CL-415 later.   One element of the Swedish demonstrations was pollution monitoring,according to James Cherry, president of Canadair's Amphibious Aircraft Div.By landing in the water near vessels suspected of discharging their bilgesillegally, the aircraft can collect samples for later analysis. Bombardierofficials said the evaluation may continue this summer.   The Canadian company has delivered two CL-415s to Quebec, four to Italyand seven to France, and is building about 10 of the aircraft per year. Theaircraft costs $18 million and is powered by two Pratt & Whitney CanadaPW123AF turboprop engines.Photograph(s):Photograph: Malaysia's recent LIMA '95 offered Bombardier a rareopportunity in Asia to demonstrate its CL-415 water bomber in action.

Saeaga will begin charter operations in January and scheduled servicesthis spring using two de Havilland Dash 8s and a Canadair Regional Jetflying from a home base in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, to Davao and GeneralSantos in the southern Philippines and Manado in north Sulawesi,Indonesia.   The aircraft sale, which is valued at $49 million, marks the first useby a single operator outside Canada of the Dash 8 and RJ. De Havilland alsoplaced four Dash 8-200s and two Dash 8-300s with another Malaysianregional, Pelangi Air, during LIMA `95 here. These were the firstplacements of Dash 8s in Malaysia, bringing to 42 the total orders for theAsia/Pacific region. It is also the first sale of an RJ in the region.   Cross-border flight operations are jealously guarded by nationalcarriers, which often do not operate 50-seat aircraft, whether turboprop orjet. As a result, the cities may be under-served by the tourist marketsimply because connections for foreigners are a burden.   Saeaga will buck this trend, taking advantage of a memorandum signedlast February by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines to promoteregional trade opportunities, including air travel, in what is called theEast Asean Growth Area.   Kota Kinabalu is an established tourist destination, but other Malaysiancities, such as Miri, are harder to reach. Miri is about 100 mi. from theSarawak Chamber, said to be the world's largest cave system. The regionoffers rain forests and excellent diving in ``untouched'' locations.   ``This region is undeveloped for air routes,'' said Rob Greatbatch ofAirtrade Aviation Consultants in Singapore.   Airtrade and another consultancy, EAA Malaysia, are establishing theairline on behalf of its owners, Ekran Berhad, a Malaysian company withinterests in hotels, and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.Ekran also operates Sabah Air and Ekran Air, which will turn over theirroutes in the region now being served by helicopters.   Part of the consultants' tasks will be to find a permanent managementteam. Recruitment of flight and cabin crews has already begun.   Saeaga's strategy is based on the top-end tourist market from the U.S.and Europe that wants to see unspoiled natural areas. For those seeking theunusual, Greatbatch suggests that diving in the Spratly Islands is apossibility.   Since Saeaga will offer some competition to the region's nationalcarriers, it will look to airlines outside the area, such as in Singaporeand Hong Kong, for booking agreements. The marketing strategy is thatSaeaga will extend their tourism packages. But much of the airline'ssuccess will depend on development of tourist facilities in places likeBalikpapan, Pontianak, Zamboanga and Tarakan.   Saeaga's Dash 8-200 will be flown in a one-class, 37-seat configuration.Its 300 will have 50 seats, as will the Canadair Regional Jet.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NMALAYSIANS SEEK KUALA LUMPUR HUB(LANGKAWI, MALAYSIA)Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad says Kuala Lumpur's new airport should tryto equal Singapore's better known Changi Airport and become a regionalhub.   That will be a stiff challenge since Changi is regarded as one of theworld's best. But Mahathir says the transformation of the nation's economyfrom a simple supplier of raw materials--chiefly rubber and tin--into asupplier of manufactured goods will support such a goal. Malaysia's economyhas had an average annual growth of at least 8% for the past eight years,and manufactured goods now account for 80% of its exports.   Emphasizing Kuala Lumpur as a regional hub would help Malaysia Airlinesgrow, give Malaysia greater bargaining power in international air servicesnegotiations, and help serve as an anchor for Mahathir's Vision 2020program to promote the country's development of a manufacturing base.   That strategy assumes that Kuala Lumpur's present airport at Subang willbecome a prime industrial location for aerospace manufacturing. The airportwill remain active for military, police and maintenance/overhaul activitiesbut be closed to passengers once the new Kuala Lumpur International Airportat Sepang opens.   However, Malaysia is a skeptic about an ``open skies'' air servicespolicy. Singapore has the opposite view and serves as a pass-through hubfor numerous foreign carriers, particularly from Europe and the U.S., ondestinations elsewhere in Southeast Asia and Australasia.   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Singapore would not maintain acompetitive advantage because of its more liberal policy. ``I don't thinkmany countries offer open skies,'' Liong Sik said during the recentaerospace conference here sponsored by AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY andthe Asian Strategy & Leadership Institute. ``Other countries haven'toffered open skies to Singapore.''   The new airport at Sepang is 30 mi. south of Kuala Lumpur and isregarded as the largest single project undertaken by the Malaysiangovernment. Built on a greenfield site of 25,000 acres, it will cost anestimated 13 billion ringgit ($5.3 billion) and is to open by January,1998.   First-phase construction includes a main terminal of 246,333 sq. meters(2.65 million sq. ft.), two 4,000-meter (13,120-ft.) runways with an8,000-ft. separation, and 80 gates and remote aircraft stands. Annualcapacity is expected to be 25 million at opening and 60 million by 2020.The site is large enough to accommodate 90 million passengers.   The Sepang airport's opening will close Kuala Lumpur's smaller airportat Sungei Besi, which had been proposed as a city airport for regionalservices. But Liong Sik says Sungei Besi is to be converted fordevelopment.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NGULFSTREAM RAMPS UP G5 TEST PROGRAMThe Gulfstream 5 features new engines and a new wing--the aircraft is14,400 lb. heavier and flies 6,000 ft. higher than its predecessor, theG4SP.By:PAUL PROCTOR(SEATTLE)Gulfstream is spooling up its G5 flight test program with a goal ofobtaining FAA certification in October and comparable Europeanauthorization by year-end.   A second G5, serial no. 502, already has begun ground-based statictesting at Gulfstream Aerospace's Savannah, Ga., factory. The next G5 tobecome airborne, serial no. 503, is scheduled to lift off later thismonth.   Gulfstream's first G5, serial No. 501, performed a successful 1 hr. 18min. maiden flight from Savannah on Nov. 28 (AW&ST Dec. 4, 1995, p. 101).The demonstration put Gulfstream solidly on track in the race to bring tomarket the world's first, 6,500-naut.-mi.-range luxury business jet. Moreimportantly, Gulfstream retained about a one-year lead on competitorBombardier's all-new Global Express.   Gulfstream claims more than a $2-billion backlog for the Gulfstream G5,which will cost more than $35 million, complete with customized passengerinterior, avionics and exterior paint. Bombardier said it holds more than40 orders for the Global Express, which is of similar range and price.   A total of four G5s will participate in flight test and certificationflying, according to Lee Johnson, director of flight test operations. Thethird aircraft to fly, serial no. 504, is scheduled to become airborne inFebruary. The fourth aircraft in the flight test fleet, no. 505, is to flyin June.   As of mid-December, the pioneer G5 had accumulated 8.4 hr. of air timeover four flights. Testing was interrupted to install a trailing-coneassembly and a stall/spin chute. The latter will be used later in theprogram during stall characterization work.   Initial test points already logged include stability, control andhandling checks over a variety of flight regimes. Aircraft speed has rangedfrom 130% of estimated stall speed to 300 kt. and altitudes as high as20,000 ft. have been achieved, Johnson said.   The flights were ``smooth and problem-free'' and the aircraft handledwell, John O'Meara, chief test pilot, said.   The function of every system on board the aircraft, many of them all-newor significant updates from the predecessor G4SP, also has been checked,Johnson said. Initial confirmation of aircraft aerodynamic projections hasbeen performed and brief autopilot tests run. The flaps and landing gearsuccessfully have been cycled.   Performance of the G5's twin 14,700-lb.-thrust BMW Rolls-Royce BR710-48powerplants also is being closely monitored. The G5 is the first aircraftto be powered by the all-new engine series. Evaluations include ``rapidreversal'' throttle changes and throttle ``slams.'' Thrust reversers havebeen deployed on every landing.   Through the remainder of the flight test program the no. 501 G5 isexpected to continue to expand the performance envelope, including thetype's planned top altitude of 51,000 ft. and maximum operating speed ofMach 0.9. A stall series is planned to be performed to evaluate theaircraft's new, high-performance wing.   OVERALL, THE G5 has a projected maximum takeoff weight of 89,000 lb.,compared with the G4SP's 74,600 lb. Maximum cruise altitude is 6,000 ft.higher than the G4SP and cruise speed is slightly faster at Mach 0.88.Despite flying heavier, faster and higher, the G5's new wing is expected torequire a Mach trim system only at speeds of Mach 0.85 and above, if atall, Johnson said.   Fuselage structure also has been beefed up to provide a 6,000-ft. cabinat 51,000-ft. This compares with 6,500 ft. at 45,000-ft. for the G4SP.   Gulfstream serial no. 503 will be used to closely evaluate the functionand reliability of aircraft systems including fuel, electrical, hydraulicsand brakes. It will perform additional flight control tests and verifybraking and steering.   This aircraft probably will fly to 3,700-ft.-high Roswell, N.M., thisJune for takeoff and landing performance trials. It also is the likelychoice to shuttle to Fairbanks, Alaska, for cold weather tests in earlyMarch.   The third G5 to join the flight test program, serial no. 504, will beused to closely examine engine and aerodynamic performance. The latter taskincludes in-flight analysis and verification of estimated flight andstructural loads, Johnson said. This airframe also will be used to verifynoise footprint, with measurements to be performed at a small airportoutside Savannah.   Gulfstream also plans to use the aircraft to conduct icing trials thisspring, weather conditions permitting.   G5 no. 504 also will evaluate cabin environmental system performanceincluding pressurization, ventilation, heating and cooling, Johnson said.Equipment cooling will be examined during planned hot weather tests inSavannah and possibly Roswell or El Centro, Calif.   G5 serial no. 505 will perform required HIRF (High Intensity RadiatedField) and lightning strike tests. An FAA pilot will be on board forcertain function and reliability and crew-workload tests needed forcertification.   Overall, about 1,700 hr. of G5 flight test is planned, Johnson said. Atthe height of activity, the test program will employ about 110 full-timeworkers, including technicians, engineers, support personnel and sixpilots. nPhotograph(s):Photograph: Gulfstream reports more than a $2-billion backlog for itsultra-long haul G5 business jet.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NGLOBAL EXPRESS SEEKS SPEED EDGEBy:DAVID HUGHES(BOSTON)Bombardier is beginning to assemble the first long-range Global Expressbusiness jet and will receive the wing and wing box/center fuselage fromMitsubishi later this month as the company prepares for a first flight inSeptember.   John Lawson, president of the Canadair Business Aircraft Div., said theall-new business jet will be certified to the same standards as the Boeing777 and will meet extended twin-engine operations (ETOPS) criteria such assystems architecture and redundancy. Like the 777, Global Express is beingdeveloped on IBM/Dassault Systemes Catia computer-aided designworkstations. Data are being exchanged via satellite communications amongthe various partners, including Bombardier's Canadair, de Havilland andShort Brothers units, as well as Mitsubishi in Japan.   The Gulfstream 5 completed its first flight in November, giving itnearly a year lead over the Global Express. But Lawson notes the Bombardieraircraft has a number of advantages in the competition, such as a largercabin and better range at high Mach numbers. While both the Global Expressand Gulfstream 5 fly 6,500 naut. mi. at Mach 0.80, the Global Express isexpected to fly nearly as far (6,330 naut. mi.) at Mach 0.85. The aircraftis also expected to fly 5,000 naut. mi. at Mach 0.88. ``Gulfstream knowshow difficult it will be to compete with this aircraft once we fly,'' hesaid.   Demand for the Global Express prompted the Bombardier board of directorslast year to add 12 more aircraft to the early production schedule--six infiscal 1998 and six in 1999. The company has received firm orders for thefirst six additional aircraft since availability was announced last June.   In all, Bombardier has announced more than 40 firm orders. This includessales in the Middle East where TAG Aeronautics, its exclusive distributor,converted four options to firm orders at the Dubai air show in November.This brings TAG's total orders to 10. Bombardier officials said the actualfigure for Global Express orders is ``well in excess'' of 44.   Lawson also expects to see a government market develop for the aircraftafter it is in production. The aircraft could be used to transport heads ofstate or high-ranking government officials.   Military versions are also possible. Lawson said Bombardier isinterested in supplying aircraft for the U.K.'s Airborne Standoff Radar(Astor) surveillance aircraft program. Teams led by Loral Europe Ltd. andRaytheon are analyzing a variety of aircraft as possible high-altitudesurveillance platforms during a 17-month project definition phase beingfunded by the British Ministry of Defense. When configured as a businessjet, Global Express can climb directly to 43,000 ft. starting at maximumtakeoff weight, Lawson said. It has a ceiling of 51,000 ft.The aircraft hastwo generators for each engine, two batteries and an APU, so it has amplepower for the mission, according to Bombardier.   The corporate version of the Global Express costs $29.5 million``green,'' and the typical price for an interior will be $3.5 million.Bombardier's completion center at Tucson, Ariz., will be actively competingfor Global Express interior work, but customers will be at liberty to pickother suppliers.   Lawson noted that the Tucson facility recently completed the interior ofthe first Canadair Special Edition (a modified Regional Jet), which has acabin about the same size as Global Express'. The Special Edition interiorweighs 5,750 lb. in a 46.2-ft.-long cabin, versus the 6,000 lb. allowed forGlobal Express' 48-ft. cabin. Lawson said the Special Edition interiorshows that Bombardier's weight allowance for Global Express completion issufficient. The Special Edition interior was designed for the TAG Group, aMiddle Eastern customer.   THE FIRST GLOBAL EXPRESS FORWARD fuselage barrel arrived in Montreallate last month and is being mated to the nose. This assembly will then beshipped to de Havilland at Downsview, Ontario, where Global Expressproduction will take place. Mitsubishi will deliver its first wing and wingbox/center fuselage section from Nagoya, Japan, to Downsview in lateJanuary. These components will be mated by late February. All aircraftsections should be assembled by late March or early April. The tail andrear fuselage are being built by de Havilland.   Bombardier also is completing an integrated systems test rig atDownsview. This will be used to test the Honeywell Primus 2000XP integratedavionics suite, the Sextant flight control system, as well as hydraulic andelectrical systems. Testing of hardware and computer software is expectedto reduce technical risk.   Lawson noted that Bombardier has a good track record in bringingaircraft to market as promised, as shown with five aircraft during the pastfive years. The company is now producing 140 aircraft per year, making itthe fifth largest producer of civil aircraft worldwide, according toLawson. And the Regional Jet, the Challenger 604 and the Lear 60 allexceeded expectations as far as initial performance guarantees. Now thatwind tunnel tests are complete, Bombardier has reduced the 5,540-ft.(1,689-meter) balanced field length estimate for Global Express by 440 ft.to 5,100 ft. (1,554 meters). This is at maximum takeoff weight, at sealevel with standard (ISA) temperatures.   At Dubai, Bombardier also said the manufacturer's empty weight for theaircraft is now guaranteed at 40,700 lb. (18,462 kg.) 2%. With the6,000-lb. (2,720-kg.) outfitting allowance, the empty weight comes up to46,700 lb. (21,183 kg.). Global Express also achieves relatively lowtakeoff and approach speeds at maximum weights with both slats and flaps onthe wings. Approach speed at maximum landing weight is 125 kt. and rotationspeed at maximum takeoff weight is 130 kt.   Bombardier officials believe there is a market for 550-850 long-rangebusiness aircraft and said sales to date have been solid. ``These are notphantom deposits,'' Lawson said.Photograph(s):Photograph: Last year, Mitsubishi fitted lower wing plank sections tostringers in Nagoya.

VELOCCI, JR.(NEW YORK)Texas Instruments' aerospace and defense business is considered by manyindustry observers a prime candidate for the auction block, but that's notthe view from Dallas.   The operation is not for sale, and top management are adamant in theircommitment to hold onto it. Speculation about the business' future has beenrekindled with the recent announcement by Westinghouse Electric Corp. thatit will sell its Electronics Systems unit.   TI looks upon the industry's consolidation very differently than manyother large companies who are making bold, strategic moves in thatprocess.   ``We don't think bigger is necessarily better,'' says Systems GroupPresident Dean Clubb. ``Our model is to acquire capabilities that will helpus satisfy the needs of our customers while giving us a competitive edge.We are working that angle all the time.''   More often than not, properties that the Group does purchase are apt tobe relatively small, niche acquisitions.   For example, TI recently acquired PhotoTelesis Corp., a defensecontractor located in San Antonio. TI, which is a major supplier ofelectro-optics for military applications, was drawn to the eight-year-oldfirm because of its specialty in advanced imagery and data transmission viamilitary radio. The technology allows images from a battlefield to betransmitted almost instantly over a satellite to monitors at a commandcenter.   With the addition of PhotoTelesis, TI expects to be able to expand itsmarkets and strengthen its strategy of equipping a digital battlefield,according to John Wright, manager of the Group's Advanced Land CombatSystems.   ``We're not that interested in purchasing things just to get bigger,''said Clubb, who also is a TI executive vice president.   The last several years certainly bear that out. During this time, anymajor U.S. aerospace/defense company interested in growth by acquisitionhas had ample opportunity to implement such a strategy. It is evident thatTI has chosen another route.   The contribution of aerospace and defense to TI's revenues has droppedto less than 20% from almost 30% in the early 1990s. Of the corporation's$10 billion in revenues in 1994, about $1.8 billion came from the Group.But it has remained solidly profitable, with net margins in the 8-12%range.   LOWER U.S. DEFENSE procurement is chiefly responsible for the decline,although explosive growth in semiconductor sales tends to exaggerate thedwindling proportion of the Group's overall contribution. TI's strongfinancial performance continues to be driven by its semiconductor business,which accounts for about 75% of its revenue and more than 90% of itsprofit.   From Wall Street, TI's aerospace and defense business is seen as havinginsufficient critical mass--or at least approaching such a state--tocompete effectively long-term in an industry that is rapidlyconsolidating.   Some analysts think the operation could be overwhelmed by competitorswho are participating in the consolidation, such as rival electronics andmissile producers Raytheon, Hughes Aircraft and perhaps even Loral. Intime, their expanding technology base and growing economies of scale couldput the TI operation at a cost disadvantage, they argue.   ``One thing you can't do in this kind of an industry environment isdither, and TI has been doing little more than standing on the sidelinesand watching as the Group's biggest competitors consolidate,'' according toone Wall Street veteran of recent large aerospace/defense transactions.``This is a very capable business, but at this point it probably has morevalue to another company.''   Not as far as TI management is concerned. ``We're a valued part of thecompany because of our systems expertise,'' Clubb said.   He ought to know. As a member of the TI Strategy Leadership Team, he isamong a small group of TI executives who shape the strategic direction ofthis $10-billion corporation. Virtually every member of the company's topmanagement, from the chairman and CEO on down, has been president of thesector containing TI's aerospace and defense business.   For years, TI has aggressively promoted a cross fertilization of ideasand technology between the Group and the company's more commercial-orientedbusiness sectors. Under contract to the government, TI created the firstforward-looking infrared systems using cryogenically-cooled detectors in1964, and in 1977 created an uncooled detector that dramatically reducedthe size and power requirements of thermal imaging. The Group remains amajor conduit for the transfer of technology developed for militaryapplications.   ``It's important to understand the culture of Texas Instruments,'' JamesSchwendinger said. He is head of the aerospace and defense practice ofDeloitte & Touche, a management consulting firm. ``TI is top tier when itcomes to knowledge transfer, and their aerospace and defense businessfigures very prominently in that process. They also have kept the businesspretty well aligned in terms of operating performance and cost-control.   ``So what if [the Group] remains a second-tier player, as long as it isthe supplier of choice in some very specialized technologies?'' he added.``Wall Street may look at this part of the Texas Instruments puzzle aslacking critical mass, but I would be very surprised to see TI cut it loseunless the business becomes a financial drain, and I don't expect that tohappen.''   The Group has three major objectives: profitable growth, higher qualityand lower production costs by at least 20%--possibly more--depending on howclosely TI and its military customers work together.   Clubb expects the Group's backlog, which has been declining in recentyears, to begin growing again within the next two years. In addition topursuing follow-ups to existing military programs, the company is exploringother defense markets that it is not now serving.   Traditionally, international sales have accounted for 12-14% of theoperation's revenues. That is expected to increase substantially. ``Thereare many foreign countries standing in line, ready to buy ourprecision-guided weapons and sensors,'' Clubb said. ``We're just waitingfor government [licensing].''   THE GROUP'S STRATEGIC business plan calls for commercializing more ofthe operation's defense technology, as well as targeting possibleopportunities in air traffic control. Texas Instruments withdrew from theFAA market several years ago.   Clubb leaves no doubt about where the quality initiative fits into theGroup's overall business strategy. ``Winning with quality may sound fairlyeasy, but our objective is to produce products at a level that would causeexisting and prospective customers to think twice before awarding acontract to anyone else.''Photograph(s):Photograph: A Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler fires an AGM-88 High-speedAnti-Radar Missile (HARM) made by Texas Instruments.RANDY JOLLYCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NU.K. TILT TO EUROPE URGED ON DEFENSEBy:JOHN D. MORROCCO(LONDON)British lawmakers are urging greater government support for preserving thenation's defense industrial base and closer cooperation with other Europeannations as a means to that end.   A joint Parliamentary report by the Defense and Trade and Industrycommittees criticized the government's short-term approach to defenseprocurement which emphasizes lowest cost. It called for the Ministry ofDefense to adopt a long-term approach to procurement aimed at retaining keystrategic capabilities within the U.K. and greater use of technologydemonstrator programs.   The government's policy of straddling the Atlantic in terms of defensecollaboration was also criticized. Lawmakers said they saw no problems withU.K. companies collaborating with U.S. companies where it was ``mutuallyadvantageous.'' But they argued that increased collaboration with otherEuropean countries is ``crucial'' to the survival of the British defenseindustry.   Lawmakers believe immense savings can be achieved through rationalizingEurope's defense industry and eliminating duplication and subsidies.   Specifically, the report says it is imperative that the U.K. be fullyinvolved in any future European armaments agency ``from its inception.''France and Germany are discussing the creation of such an agency that couldinitially exclude the U.K. British officials fear this would give Frenchand German companies an early lead in European cooperative programs thatmight result in the marginalization of British defense companies.   Lawmakers also want to see any such efforts go beyond just coordinatingand managing joint programs. It foresees greater savings throughcoordination of military requirements, perhaps by the Western EuropeanArmaments Group, an agency of the Western European Union.   But the underlying message of the report was that more attention must bepaid to the long-term health of the U.K. defense industry. Awardingcontracts to foreign suppliers based on competitive cost reasons alonecould result in the long-term loss of critical domestic skills.   Preserving the U.K. defense technology base should be a ``priority,''the report stated. Such considerations should be ``built into theprocurement process from the initial stages right through to the decisionto order the equipment.'' Specifically, lawmakers called for:  -- Identification of critical technologies for the industry anddevelopment of strategies to retain a leading edge.  -- Promotion of dual-use technologies.  -- Increased funding for technology demonstrator programs.  -- Clearer guidelines to industry on priorities for procurementdecisions.  -- A more active government role in promoting ``fair access'' for U.K.companies to overseas markets and in pressing for the elimination ofsubsidies to foreign manufacturers.  -- Considering export potential at an early stage in determining weaponspecifications.   Sir Barry Duxbury, director of the Society of British AerospaceCompanies (SBAC), ``wholeheartedly'' welcomed the report. Many of itsrecommendations echo those of the SBAC, including the call for increasedfunding for technology demonstrator programs to preserve critical skillsand reduce procurement costs. He is awaiting with interest the formalresponse of the Ministry of Defense to the report which is not expecteduntil later this year.   ANTICIPATING THE REPORT, however, a senior Ministry of Defense officialsaid a more ``systematic'' approach to the long-term viability of thedefense industrial base would be taken in future procurement decisions.Days before the report was released, Minister for Defense Procurement JamesArbuthnot said ``cost effective collaboration''within a European defenseindustry would be pursued with ``maximum vigor.'' But he also noted thatopportunities existed to build upon the U.K. defense industry's ``strongfoothold'' in the U.S.   The balance between buying off-the-shelf systems, largely from the U.S.,versus collaborative or national development is to be reexamined in lightof future strategic requirements. A key indicator of how far the governmentis willing to go could come shortly when it decides on whether to upgradeRoyal Air Force F3 Tornado fighters, lease used U.S. F-16s or keep patchingthem up until the Eurofighter 2000 arrives next century.   This is a sensitive issue, given the criticism of two previous decisionsin which the U.K. opted to buy U.S.-developed systems--the Lockheed MartinC-130J and the McDonnell Douglas AH-64--rather than European-developedalternatives. Issues of preserving critical skills and jobs were key inthose competitions.   The Ministry of Defense has been evaluating F-16s as a far less costlyalternative to upgrading its Tornado F3 interceptors. But it isquestionable whether the long-term costs would outweigh the short-termbenefits. The Royal Air Force would have to develop an entirely newlogistics system to support the F-16s.Photograph(s):Photograph: Leasing more capable F-16s instead of upgrading existingTornado F3s could undermine support for the Eurofighter 2000.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NCONFERENCE OUTLINES SPACE `RAMP-UP' PLANBy:WILLIAM B. SCOTT(COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO.)A classified conference here last month outlined for U.S. theater commandstaffs how joint and service space commands would allocate orbital assetsand provide space support if peacetime operations ``ramp up'' to a combatfooting.   Some discussions are believed to have addressed scenarios that mightarise during the current Bosnian peacekeeping effort, and how militaryspace assets could be used by U.S. forces. Military officials would notcomment on particulars of the meeting, however.   THE THIRD ANNUAL Space Support to the Warfighter Conference, cohosted bythe U.S. Space Command (USSC) and the National Reconnaissance Office'sOperational Support Office, attracted about 250 attendees from 40organizations. The five-day meeting included senior working-level teamsfrom the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff; commander-in-chief (CINC) staffs fromPacific, Central, Atlantic and European theaters; Air Force, Navy and Armyspace commands; national intelligence agencies, and the Defense InformationSystems Agency.   This year's event included briefings, working groups and demonstrationsor displays related to space ``force enhancement'' topics, such as:  -- Communications.  -- Navigation (Global Positioning System).  -- Space control.  -- Missile warning and the Theater Event System, with emphasis ontheater-class missile threats.  -- Intelligence.  -- New modeling and simulation techniques and tools, such as the TheaterSupport Operations Cell (TSOC). Carried by Space Support Teams (SSTs)during deployments to an exercise, the prototype TSOC is a SiliconGraphics-based computer system that depicts space data in user-friendlygraphics. For example, it displays orbits of satellite constellations in asimple format, enabling better visualization of coverage at a particulartime (AW&ST Sept. 18, 1995, p. 36).   ``TSOC focuses on the implications of space systems, not thetechnology,'' said Col. Gary W. Dahlen, vice-director of operations forUSSC. ``The most important purpose of this tool is to improve situationalawareness and battlespace knowledge. Operational commanders are fluent inwhat ships, tanks and airplanes do. What hasn't been in their bag of tricksis knowledge about space systems.''   Demonstrated for conference attendees this year, TSOC uses commercialand government-developed software already developed for other purposes.Service versions now being acquired for Air Force, Navy and Army spacesupport teams will closely parallel the USSC-developed version.   Last month's conference also devoted an afternoon to the concept ofglobal broadcast systems (GBS), a potentially revolutionary method forcommunicating data to many troops at once via spacecraft. Analogous todirect broadcast television, GBS would beam information to specific areason a battlefield or theater. Conference attendees were to help develop aconsistent set of requirements for direct broadcast data.   ``We're trying to understand what the field wants,'' Dahlen said priorto the conference. ``Should data be `pushed' or `pulled'? Should there be a'smart hub' that sends data on only some channels? Should there be anyfeedback mechanism or status messages? How does [GBS] interact with theconcept of the Global Command and Control System?''   THE ANNUAL SPACE SUPPORT conference was initiated in 1993 to improvecoordination between the USSC and theater CINCs. To support the needs ofCINC staffs unfamiliar with space-based capabilities, USSC and its servicecomponents set up SSTs dedicated to providing expertise to theater or``warfighting'' commanders and their staffs. Led by an Air Force or Armycolonel or Navy captain having operational experience, these SSTs nowsupport 10-15 major CINC exercises annually. Team members spend 140-180days/year in-theater, helping staffs integrate space capabilities intoexercise planning and execution (AW&ST Dec. 12/19, 1994, p. 24). Now``space officers'' are assigned permanently to CINC staffs to assist withday-to-day operations.   End-of-year space support conferences were established ``to tie up theloose ends and bring everybody up to date,'' on technologies, issues andspace command activities, Dahlen said. Because attendees consistently havebeen ``operators'' from CINC staffs, such as directors of intelligence,operations and communications, the meetings typically concentrate oncapabilities available now or in the near future.   ``THE FIRST YEAR we had about 10 people from the unified commands andtheir components. The second year we had 10-19, and this year [requestsranged from] 13 for some commands and up to 25 for others. These forumsseem to be attracting the right people,'' said Chris H. Lugenbill, a memberof the OAO Corp./PRC Inc. contract support team for USSC. About twice asmany people request attendance as can be accommodated at each conference.   The annual events are hands-on, practical sessions aimed at providingapplicable information that attendees can take back to their units andapply immediately. Dialogue also has helped the space community betterfocus its support efforts.   ``Our first priority is to understand the field guy's job, and thesecond is to broker space solutions to problems the field commanders mighthave,'' Dahlen said. ``Many people out in the field thought there was amystique about space systems--'behind the green door' [highly classified]or too technical. We now give them hands-on [experience] such as operatinga GPS 'Slugger,' manipulating multispectral data and using communicationdevices.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NBOEING PLANS EELV TESTINGBy:JOSEPH C. ANSELMO(WASHINGTON)Boeing is planning an air drop and water retrieval of a propulsion systemcontaining a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) to demonstrate the viabilityof using recoverable components for a new launch vehicle family.   The air drop will be part of a series of tests the company plans toperform this summer as part of a $30-million contract it won last August tovalidate its concept for the Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle(EELV) program.   Similar EELV contracts were won by Alliant Techsystems, Lockheed Martinand McDonnell Douglas, but only two competitors are slated to survive whenthe Air Force awards pre-engineering, manufacturing and developmentcontracts in December.   Boeing officials believe their plan to use a recoverable propulsionmodule powered by a Block 2 SSME offers the best hope of meeting the EELVprogram goal of lowering launch costs by 25-50%. The company recentlysigned an agreement with NASA to utilize a spare SSME and engine testfacilities at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.   Plans call for the SSME to be integrated with a 17-ft.-dia. prototypepropulsion module that is being built for Boeing by Textron. Testing wouldbegin this summer with several simulated drops from a test stand crane intoa canal at Stennis to verify integration and instrumentation data. Thatwould be followed by an airplane drop of the propulsion module, possiblyover the Gulf of Mexico.   ``Basically, we'll be demonstrating the conclusion of the operationalsequence as the propulsion module is decelerated and returned by waterentry,'' said Tim White, Boeing's EELV program manager.   The propulsion system would then be recovered and the SSME test-fired todemonstrate its reusability, he said.   The idea of a recoverable propulsion module is not new to Boeing. Thecompany conducted 550 tests over 14 years as part of its proposals for theill-fated Advanced Launch System and National Launch System programs. Butthis summer's tests will mark the first time that live engine hardware hasbeen used.   NASA has also offered the use of Stennis' three active test stands toBoeing's EELV competitors, but only Boeing has signed an agreement to date,according to Patrick Scheuermann, EELV project manager at the space center.He said Stennis is eager to offer its facilities for use by industry andthe military.Photograph(s):Photograph: Boeing plans to use this test stand at Stennis Space Center(Miss.) for its EELV effort.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NTHE$112-MILLION NEAR EARTHBy:EDITED BY JAMES R.

VELOCCI, JR./NEW YORK   TRW Inc. is preparing to take action to increase shareholder valuesubstantially. Among other things, the company is considering repurchasinga block of its own stock as well as acquisitions.   Whatever TRW does, some Wall Street analysts are hoping it includes thesale of the information systems and services unit. The business accountsfor 6% of total sales. While the unit seems to be holding its own, theanalysts believe it could do even better if spun off to the right buyer.Some market professionals believe such a move would raise TRW's tradingmultiple.   ``The perception is that TRW cares very little about shareholdervalue,'' said Jack Blackstock, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &Jenrette. ``Depending on how aggressively the company addresses this issue,it's not hard to envision the stock at $100-115 a share.'' While Blackstockhas set a 12-month target price of $90-100, he described the company as a``table-pounding buy.'' The stock closed at 771/4 last Wednesday.   Definitely not on the list of options is the sale of TRW's space anddefense business, according to Chairman and CEO Joseph T. Gorman. Aftersagging in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is showing net growth. Salesin 1995 exceeded $3 billion. Not since 1987 has space and defense made sucha relatively large contribution to TRW's coffers. In the first nine monthsof 1995, the operation logged $3.6 billion in new contracts. Firm backlogstands at a record $4.6 billion.   ``I was among the analysts who sat around in disbelief back in 1992 whenGorman told us the space and defense business would show net growthstarting in the second half of the 1990s, and it's turning out that he wasright,'' Blackstock said. ``What that tells me is that he's a lot betterthan people give him credit for.''   As expected, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. recentlywon their court battle over the 1991 cancellation of the U.S. Navy's A-12attack aircraft. A federal judge ruled the program was killed forconvenience, not default as the government contended. Now, one outstandingissue is how much of the $2 billion-plus in claims the contractors willcollect. The other issue is whether the government will appeal.   Some aerospace analysts believe the anticipated win already is reflectedin the companies' stock prices. ``This did not come as a surprise, althoughit was a big step toward clearing the air,'' Merrill Lynch analyst ByronCallan said. ``Now the question is not whether they'll get something butwhen and how much.'' What has not been factored into the stock prices ishow a settlement could enhance earnings power, Callan added.   ``I would be surprised if there is no attempt to seek damages over andabove the claims already pending,'' JSA Research analyst Paul Nisbet noted.``If that happens, there could be two paydays.'' Executives of bothcompanies have cited possible damage to their concerns' reputations fromgovernment accusations.   Callan and Nisbet think the stock prices could increase slightly on thereality of the settlement, depending on size and timing. If the companiesdo collect, McDonnell Douglas is expected to use the windfall to pay downdebt and add to its war chest for acquisitions. General Dynamics, which isvirtually debt-free and has about $1 billion in cash, is expected to useall of the money for acquisitions.

NORDWALL(WASHINGTON)A cooling system developed by Fairchild Controls using refrigerant and anunusual compressor design is gaining applications to cool military avionicsthat require high output and low weight.   The vapor cycle system has an efficiency 10-20% greater than an aircycle system, according to Drew Bogus, director for business development atFairchild Controls. The electrically powered design avoids the degradationsin aircraft performance sometimes caused by large bleed air extraction topower the alternative--a conventional air-cycle environmental controlsystem. Still, the system puts an electrical load on the engine drawing 36Kva. for maximum cooling in the latest application.   That utilization uses two independent systems to cool the Apache Longbowmission avionics. One cools the forward avionics bay and gunner, and theother cools the aft avionics and pilot. First flight for the Apache Longbowinstallation was late September, about 15 months after contract award.Production deliveries could begin in October, Bogus said.   The positive displacement compressor has an unusual helical-rotordesign. Twin counter-rotating screws give the heli-rotor higher compressionefficiency, in a small housing, than other compressor designs, according tothe company. The compressors are currently produced in two sizes, a 54-mm.diameter and a 30-mm. The smaller of the rolling piston compressors hascooling capacities between 2 and 4.5 kW., depending on the applications.   The small rotors turn at about 11,000 rpm., a much lower speed than aircycle machines, because the thermodynamic properties of their refrigerantrequire less mass through the compressor to get the same cooling capacity.The closed-loop vapor cycle system uses HFC-134a, the environmentallyfriendly refrigerant now standard for most automotive air conditioners.Company officials say the lower speed makes the system inherently morereliable with a current MTBF (mean time between failure) of 1,500 hr. and agoal of 2,000 hr. Vapor cycle systems are also quieter, producing about 50%less noise, according to Bogus. They can be designed to run at multiplespeeds, high for rapid cooling, low for standard use.   The increasing density of military avionics is creating the need forcooling solutions such as this vapor cycle system and liquid flow-throughcooling in the U.S. Air Force's new F-22 and the Army's AH-66 Comanchehelicopter. But the technology is far from new. Fairchild Controls' vaporcycle systems have been used for years in the Pave tack airborne targetingand laser designation system for F-111s and for cooling VIP helicopters.Photograph(s):Photograph: Fairchild Controls' twin counter-rotating screws give theheli-rotor high compression efficiency in a small housing.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightAVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 144, NMITSUBISHI INTRODUCES AIRBORNE IR IMAGER(WASHINGTON)Mitsubishi's new IR-G600 high-resolution thermal imager is designed foraircraft/unmanned aerial vehicles.

International aviation decisions should turn on what is best forour country, not which carriers can generate the most political support. In1995, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena did an excellent job in thisregard. U.S. passenger and cargo carriers are capitalizing on a plethora ofnew international opportunities, while the increased competition isbringing consumers lower air fares, reduced shipping costs and greaterchoices. . . .   Looking ahead to 1996 . . . we face a number of challenges, most notablyaviation policy with Japan and the U.K. Also, we have a golden opportunityto obtain an ``open skies'' agreement with Germany that would be a catalystfor further liberation of European air service opportunities. . . .   The major impediment to liberalizing aviation relations with Japan isthe high operating cost of Japanese carriers, due in large part to Japan'stightly regulated airline industry. Until Japan permits its carriers tobecome more competitive, there will be enormous pressure within the countryto continue to protect its air service market.   Japan, along with other Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation membersincluding the U.S., recently committed to work toward free and open tradebetween all member nations. The so-called Bogor Declaration has thepotential to have a major impact on U.S./Japan aviation relations.   ONE THING, HOWEVER, IS CERTAIN: The continued refusal of Japan to abideby the terms of U.S./Japan bilateral concerning beyond rights guaranteed toseveral of our carriers undoubtedly will complicate aviation relationsbetween our two countries. Currently, Japan is refusing to honor UnitedAirlines' right to provide service between Osaka and Seoul. FedEx is beingwrongfully denied the right to provide service between Japan and China.Beyond rights from Japan are absolutely essential if U.S. carriers are tofully participate in the booming Asia-Pacific market. . . .   Of all our international aviation agreements, the most restrictive andtherefore our most anti-consumer bilateral is the so-called Bermuda 2 pact.Approximately 58% of the passenger traffic between the U.S. and U.K. iscarried on British airlines. In 1984-85, British carriers improved theirmarket share vis-a-vis U.S. airlines by 21%. During the same period, amajority of carriers from other European Community countries lost marketshare. These statistics are particularly remarkable when one considers thatoperating costs of European carriers are higher than those of U.S.airlines...   THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT IS ENTHUSIASTIC about promptly securing an openskies agreement with the U.S. An open skies agreement with Germanyimmediately would produce new air service opportunities for our carriersbetween the U.S. and Germany. Equally important, German airports wouldprovide well-situated gateways for our carriers to serve points beyondGermany such as the Middle East and the booming Asia-Pacific market.   An open skies agreement with Germany--in combination with liberalizedair service agreements we secured with the Netherlands in 1992 and nineother European countries earlier this year--would mean nearly half of allpassengers traveling between the U.S. and Europe would be flying to or fromEuropean countries with open skies regimes. The recent European Commissionreport on E.C./U.S. aviation relations astutely concluded that otherEuropean countries that resist liberalization ``will either have to followthe open skies policy, or risk being left behind in the competition and inmarket share.''   BETWEEN 1992 AND 1994, total passenger traffic between the U.S. and theNetherlands grew an astounding 56%. During the same period, total passengertraffic between the U.S. and U.K. grew just 7.5%. What does thisillustrate? It demonstrates that Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is drawingpassenger traffic originating in the U.S. away from U.K. airports,particularly London Heathrow.   The international aviation challenges we face in 1996 make it imperativethat our negotiators continue to make decisions based on economic analysiswith the goal of maximizing benefits for the U.S. economy. This was asuccessful formula in our 1995 international aviation negotiations. In1996, it is critical we build on the lesson we learned during the pastyear.About the Author(s):Larry Pressler (R.-S.D.) chairs the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce,Science and Transportation. In a speech on the Senate floor just before theholidays, he said 1996 will be a critical year for the U.S. ininternational aviation negotiations. And, he outlined his vision ofstrategies the nation should pursue.

EVACUATE!A few lessons, and one or two laughs from an actual evacuation.By:Dan ManninghamOn October 9, 1969, United Airlines Flight 74 operated as a DC-8 from LasVegas to New York. Fred Edwards was the captain, Tom Greene was secondofficer (Flight Engineer) and I was in the copilot seat. It was a typical``Vegas'' trip, being nearly full with a crowd of New Yorkers on their wayhome from the tables.   In the front lounge, four passengers were playing poker. These were fourrough-looking guys. Tough, mean, angry. Definitely not the types you wouldexpect to see at an arts festival or the garden club.   One of those men would make an excellent character for a movie. He couldbe in the orthopedic business, a bone specialist. He could be named``Frank'' or something. At least that's how he looked to me.   This Frank appeared to have a 20-inch neck, 30-inch sleeve, 40-inchwaist, was about 50 years old, 60 pounds overweight, 70 inches tall with anIQ of 80. He had hands like shovels and a face like raw meat. And he lookedmean. This was not a guy who worried about whales or human suffering in adrought-stricken country.   The IQ thing was just appearance, though. Frank was no dummy. As thegame progressed, Frank stuffed his considerable winnings into hissee-through shirt so that his ample torso was eventually obscured by layersof tens and twenties. By the time we began the Canarsie VOR approach toRunway 13L at JFK, Frank was finishing a solid payday, and his threecompanions were looking unhappy.   In the cockpit, the flight was completely normal. The evening in NewYork was clear, cool and calm in the nicest sense of a fall twilight. Fredflew the Canarsie approach with his usual skill, and we rolled out right onfinal and with the VASI lights perfectly red over white. The touchdown wassweet, and we made the early turnoff with the help of considerable enginereverse. Fred was an artist of flight.   As we cleared the runway, our day began in earnest with the simultaneousarrival of two separate communications. First, the tower controller calledto say, ``United 74, it appears that your right wing is on fire.'' At thesame instant, the cabin call chime rang urgently, and Tom grabbed the phoneto hear the aft flight attendant say that the entire right wing was inflames. Without warning, we were on fire in a big way, and the conclusionto a routine flight suddenly became the beginning of a serious challenge.The next five minutes contained so many separate activities that 26 yearslater, my memory is expanded as if it contained several hours.   My job was to proceed (that was the word in the emergencyprocedure-''proceed'') to the ground and direct the evacuation from there.It was my favorite emergency assignment: Leave the burning airplane forothers to deal with, and help the passengers as they came off (as in, ``Youstay here, and I'll go for help.'')   Fred and I shut down all four engines, and the airplane was suddenlyquiet and dark. The emergency lights worked off a dedicated battery, andthat provided minimal illumination. My ``proceeding'' took me over thepedestal and directly across Tom's lap. (I think he still has a heel printon his right thigh.)   When I opened the cockpit door, the forward flight attendant-a largewoman-was just latching open the big entry door. Her size had combined withan adrenaline rush to create enough raw energy to slam that heavy door openlike the screen door on Grandpa's cabin. The slide was inflating nicely,too.   For some reason, the PA wasn't functioning, so I exercised myconsiderable talents at sheer oral volume to announce to the passengersthat leaving the airplane was a wise choice at this particular time oftheir lives. I just shouted that message down the long, dark cabin and wasamazed to watch passengers suddenly spring to their feet in search of anexit. I later learned that the flight attendants at the rear door heardevery word clearly, a fact that did not surprise my children.   Frank did not need any such instruction. He had seen the flames throughhis window and pushed his way onto the slide after scooping up all of themoney on the table and stuffing it into his already bulging shirt. He hitthe ground running and was never seen again. Not in the assembly. Not onthe buses to the terminal. And not at baggage claim. Frank had his ownagenda.   I followed Frank to the ground, and instructed the next two passengersto assist others as they came off the slide before I moved to the nextevacuation station. New Yorkers were leaving the airplane like commuters attheir home station. From the over-wing exit, passengers were sliding offthe flap, and I asked one of the men to instruct the evacuees to assembleon the grass well clear of the airplane. I still hadn't seen the right wingwhere the fire was, but I was on my way. Approximately 30 seconds hadelapsed from the initial transmission from the tower.   As I rounded the tail, the airplane appeared completely normal in everyrespect, with no evidence of fire or any other distress. This was bothpleasing and puzzling, but the evacuation was in progress and needed to beconcluded as safely as possible.   When I reached the right-flap area, a large, ungainly woman was justscooting toward the drop-off point and sobbing in terror at the prospect ofsliding those 10 feet or so to the ground. I made a quick judgment call tosend her back through the airplane because I could see that she wouldalmost certainly suffer severe harm in the drop. By this time her . . .well, her ah . . . her umm . . . posterior was somewhat critically balancedat the flap hinge so that she had great difficulty performing a maneuverthat could best be described as cheek reversal. Still, with the help ofloud encouragement and a male passenger on the wing, she was able towriggle her hindquarters back up onto the wing far enough to stand up andwalk back to the over-wing exit. From there, she could re-enter theairplane and then leave again in a relatively safe and dignified manner byway of an entrance door slide.   By this time, no more people were coming out, so I returned to the leftside where the passengers were assembling, sort of. Getting 120 passengersto stand still in one area following a serious emotional trauma was likeherding turtles. Individuals and groups just kept wandering off and had tobe repeatedly asked to stay put for a head count.   Suddenly, that big empty airplane seemed very dark and quiet. A lightbreeze flowed across JFK, and a sweet melancholy pervaded the scene of 120people who were safely evacuated but now were coping with very real andvery recent fear. Passengers stood around in small groups and talkedquietly as though something solemn was happening. And in a way, it was.   At that moment, a young man approached me to say that his ``baby wasstill on the airplane.'' That started the adrenaline all over again, and Iscrambled up the aft slide into the dark cabin of the abandoned airliner, afeat that proved to be far more difficult than I anticipated due to theangle and slickness of the slide. I noticed Fred right behind me, andtogether we searched the cabin but found nothing. No passengers, no babyand only the detritus of 120 human beings on their way home from acompletely frivolous journey: decks of cards, newspapers and empty cups. Wesearched again, quickly, and then slid to the ground for the second time tofind the father with his baby in his arms. There never was an explanation.Fathers are entitled to that.   Now I noticed that the area was filling with fire vehicles, policecruisers and airport officials. Shortly thereafter, buses arrived to takethe passengers to the terminal where they would eventually retrieve theirluggage. Somehow, we got our bags from the airplane and made our way to thecompany office spaces in the United hangar. It was a lousy way to end atrip, and it was not over.   Fred knew that the NTSB-and others-would want a complete statement ofthe event. He also knew that it was difficult to provide a coherent andconsistent statement from three individuals. Therefore, we grabbed anotherpilot in operations and adjourned to a diner to review the experience.Fred, Tom and I sorted through the details of a 60-second experience fornearly three hours until we were satisfied that the details were correctand in proper sequence.   I went home and typed three copies on my 20-year-old mechanical Royal sothat we could meet with various investigative bodies in the morning andsound rational as a crew in the process. This was not an exercise inobfuscation but, rather, an attempt to organize our collective memories foraccuracy.   We all agreed that the evacuation was a valuable experience, gained withminimal harm to people or property. We were all surprised by the greatvalue of United's disciplined and repeated training in evacuations.According to the control tower's reckoning, the airplane was completelyemptied in less than 60 seconds. If the fire had propagated, that mighthave been all the time we would have had.   We all chuckled at ``Frank'' and his behavior, but that was a lesson inhuman independence and fickleness.   We noticed that nothing ever works as planned; in this case, the PAfailed when we needed it most. Also, the aft, left slide originallydeployed straight down, which would have prevented its use. But,fortunately, some passengers were able to shake it into position. Still,that delayed the evacuation for several seconds.   I personally reviewed my decision to send two or three people back intothe airplane from the right wing, and concluded that it did probably save aserious injury-but at some risk to those passengers if the fire hadrekindled. Still, it's always hard to argue with success. It could havegone wrong, but it didn't.   We noticed in retrospect that the lack of daylight complicated theentire procedure. Darkness in the cabin and on the ground made everythingmore difficult. Pocket flashlights were a tremendous help.   I was impressed by the readiness of passengers to respond to firm, loudorders to evacuate. Even those who had watched the fire through the windowsdidn't move toward the exits until expressly ordered to do so by acrewmember.   We all found the process of developing a coherent statement together tobe extremely beneficial. The Safety Board received that statement the wayin which it was intended, and no one questioned our motives for preparingit.   The morning meetings went well. No threat of legal or punitive actionwas raised. In fact, we were given a compliment or two. After meeting withthe officials, I walked out to look over the airplane.   It was sunny that morning-sunny and warm. The DC-8 stood alone on thehangar ramp; deserted. It looked more dignified with its doors closed andthe slides removed. It looked like the proud airplane it was, even as itlooked isolated and abandoned. It was a reminder that character is withinthe individual, not the group.   I examined the aircraft carefully, but there was no evidence of a fire.No soot, or charring or damage. The lighting that morning was excellent,and any evidence of fire should have been clearly visible, but there wasnone. I would find out later that no one ever did find evidence of a fire.The great fire that had alarmed the tower controllers from more than a mileaway, that the flight attendants saw through the windows and thatfrightened Frank was a mystery. Some things just are.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   ATC ON THE BLINKATC computers seem to be dropping like flies. What's wrong with the system,and what will you encounter if you get caught in an outage?By:Perry Bradley   In May 1993, when the Clinton administration began its push forcorporatizing the ATC system, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena andVice President Al Gore held a press conference at Washington NationalAirport to demonstrate just how dire was the need for change. Pena and Goreheld up vacuum tubes and displayed archaic computer terminals to prove thepoint that the FAA desperately needed reform.   As it turns out, the publicity stunt with the vacuum tube was prophetic.Although several plans for FAA reform have come and gone in the interveningyears, aging ATC equipment has begun to exact its toll on the system'susers, as predicted.   Even though overall system availability is at 99.4 percent-an all-timehigh-reports of equipment outages seem to be coming ever more frequently,especially at Air Route Traffic Control Centers. Witness these recentexamples:   -- On August 9, 1995, a power out-age at Oakland Center caused 333delays and one TCAS resolution alert. Full service was restored after 78minutes.   -- On September 7, 1995, a power failure at Kansas City Center caused aservice interruption lasting six hours, 23 minutes, resulting in 13delays.   -- On October 17, 1995, a power failure at Fort Worth Center resultedin 263 delayed flights. The equipment failure lasted 14 hours, 35 minutes;air traffic services were disrupted for 12 minutes.   -- On September 11, 1995, a computer failure at Chicago Center resultedin 35 delays and one ``operational error.'' Service was fully restored intwo hours, eight minutes. On November 1, two computer failures at ChicagoCenter resulted in 313 delays.   -- On November 16, 1995, New York Center twice went to back-up systemsfor a total of 48 minutes due to a computer error. Approximately 30aircraft were delayed.AN AGING SYSTEM   Glitches like these were never supposed to happen. The AdvancedAutomation System (AAS), conceived in the mid 1980s, was to have completelymodernized and restructured the nation's ATC system. AAS' failure is welldocumented. Almost from the outset, program milestones began slipping, andcosts skyrocketed. Several program reviews followed, ultimately resultingin a radical restructuring of the automation plans.   Stan Rivers, the FAA's deputy director for airway facilities, saystoday's problems have their roots in delays in the modernization program.``You just can't keep stuff around for 30 or 40 years without running intosustainability problems,'' he notes, explaining that wiring becomesbrittle, components wear out, and it gets tougher to find people who knowhow to keep the old systems running. ``That's just age, and there's almostnothing you can do about it.''   Federal officials prefer the term ``service interruption'' to outage.But semantics aside, no one disagrees that the ATC system is showing itsage. And with even temporary fixes more than a year away, experts alsoagree that the string of interruptions will continue for the foreseeablefuture.   While news reports have tended to lump all the failures together, infact, the interruptions have occurred for a variety of reasons-somerelated, some downright mundane. For instance, New York Center twice wentto its back-up systems on November 16, 1995, prompting some limited delays.While a software problem initially was suspected, it turned out a stuck keyat a controller's workstation sent 14,000 commands to one of the center'scomputers, overwhelming it and prompting it to shut down, according to JohnWalker, who manages New York Center.   Still, there are two common threads linking a number of the outages overthe past year: First, the most serious upsets have been complete powerfailures that ironically stemmed from an initiative to upgrade the powergrid at the 20 center facilities. Oakland, California, New York and ChicagoCenter all had complete failures during the switch to the new ARTCCCritical and Essential Power System, or ACEPS.   ``At some point, you have to switch over from the old to the new, andthat's a sensitive transfer,'' says Rivers. The FAA has since revised someof its procedures for working on the power grid to minimize the chance of aproblem.   The other frequently implicated component is a 1960s-vintage IBMmainframe computer that drives controller displays in the five busiestcenters. In the mid 1970s, 15 of the 20 center facilities made thetransition to a Raytheon Computer Display Channel. However, the fivecenters with the highest volume-Chicago, Cleveland, Fort Worth, New Yorkand Washington, D.C.-retained the older IBM 9020Es that are failing withincreasing regularity. In August 1995, the FAA decided to invest $65million to replace the 9020Es, beginning in 1997.REDUNDANT SYSTEMS   Despite all the hype, chances are if a center has a failure, you willactually feel very little impact-if you know about it at all, according tocontrollers and FAA officials. The centers are built with at least twolayers of redundant systems backing up the primary operating system. (Seeaccompanying graphic.)   Of the more than 82-million air traffic operations annually, fewer than250,000 experience delays, according to the FAA. Some 98 percent of delaysare weather related, leaving just two percent of all delays attrib-utableto equipment failures. Still, it does happen.   Simply stated, an air route traffic control center comprises three basiccomputing components: the host computer, the Display Channel Complex (DCC)and the Direct Access Radar Channel (DARC). The systems are intertwined insuch a way that if one of them fails, the others can make up for itsabsence, albeit with reduced capabilities.   The host computers, IBM 3038 mainframes installed in the mid 1980s, arethe nerve center of the operation. They handle all flight-data processingincluding flight plans, automated hand-offs, and automatic flight-progressstrip generation.   From the host computer, data are fed to the DCC. The DCC processes radarinformation and drives the controller's display. Ironically, the fivebusiest centers have the oldest DCCs. ``They're a little older thananything else we've got,'' says the FAA's Rivers.   The final component in the triad is the DARC. The DARC is a back-upsystem that sends comparatively raw radar data directly to controllerworkstations. If the DCC fails, the system reverts to DARC/Host operations.If the DCC and the host computer both fail, the system goes to DARC-onlyoperations, the most degraded condition short of an all-out shutdown.WHEN THE SYSTEM BLINKS   Denis Burke has had more than his fair share of experience with computeroutages and back-up systems over the last year or so. As air trafficmanager at Chicago Center, Burke has seen seven outages since September1994, and says he expects more. ``Technicians are watching over [the 9020E]very carefully,'' Burke comments. ``It's been gone over with a fine-toothedcomb. We expect that though we will probably experience some more outages,they won't be significant.''   When a system does fail, the first thing the center will do is``sterilize'' its airspace, according to Burke. In September 1994, Chicagoexperienced its worst outage (to date) when power to the facility wasinterrupted for an instant during maintenance. After the outage, all of thecomputers had to spool back up, a process Burke likens to rebooting yourhome computer. In that instance, it took just 12 minutes to sterilize thecenter's 133,000-square-mile chunk of airspace.   In the event of an outage, the center contacts FAA flow control, whichinstitutes a ground hold on any inbound aircraft not yet airborne. Trafficalready en route, but not yet in the affected center's airspace, will bererouted around the center. Aircraft already in the center's airspace mightbe asked to hold while controllers verify that all the aircraft they arehandling are up on the back-up system. Alternatively, some aircraft in thearea may be handed off to other centers or to approach controllers.   Controllers often let pilots know when they are experiencing equipmenttrouble, but notification is not required. Some of the hallmarks of aproblem, says Burke, are ground delays on days when weather obviously isn'tan issue, or when you suddenly hear new transponder codes being given toaircraft in your area. Because their workload goes up during an outage,controllers often will ask pilots not to read back instructions unless soadvised.   Power outages also can take down radios. In the event of a com failure,you are expected to adhere to your last clearance and to attempt toreestablish communications on your last assigned frequency. If that doesn'twork, try calling the nearest flight service station, or any other ATCfacility in your area-an approach control or control tower, for instance.Chances are, by the time you establish contact, word of the failure will beout, and plans will be set in motion to handle the aircraft involved.   Burke and other facility mangers who have experienced outages say pilotshave conducted themselves in outstanding fashion. Indeed, the FAA confirmsjust two operational errors in 1995 during outages. Obviously, TCAS is avaluable tool for pilots and provides an additional safety net during anoutage.FAILURE MODES   Noting the system's inherent redundancy, Burke says the transition tothe DARC/Host-the primary back-up-can be virtually transparent. ``Truly theonly catastrophe that's involved is the lack of ability to move the samevolume of traffic,'' he explains.   In DARC/Host mode, controllers begin to lose some of their ``enhanced''capabilities. No longer do they get automatic conflict alerts, minimum safealtitude warnings, or the ability to put a five-mile distance referenceindicator circle around slow-moving traffic to ease vectoring otheraircraft.   However, most functions of the primary system are replicated. ``Theinformation you need to separate airplanes is all there: location, speed,altitude, direction of flight, and flight plan,'' says Burke.``Everything's there, but some of the enhancements that have been addedover the years are no longer there, and that's always a concern, but it'snot a safety issue.''The host computer continues to operate in DARC/Host mode, and that meanscontrollers still have access to flight-plan information, can automaticallyhand-off traffic to other ATC facilities, and get automatic preparation ofpaper flight-progress strips that are used to back-up radar information.   If the primary system fails, controllers may have a little additionalwork to ensure that the transition to the back-up is successful. But oncethe changeover is verified, operations should be almost business as usual.   A worse event is the failure of both the DCC and the host computer.Although rare, such dual failures have occurred, and their impact can bedramatic. In essence, when the system reverts to DARC only, controllershave to do their work either manually or verbally, which reduces theability to handle traffic by as much as 70 percent.   For instance, while radar screens still track aircraft, all of theflight-data-processing functions go off-line when the host computer shutsdown. That means controllers have to manually create and update data stripsand hand-off all traffic verbally, which requires land-line contact withother controllers.TO THE RESCUE?   The recent spate of outages and the attention they've gotten in thepress have prompted the FAA to decide to spend $65 million to upgrade thetroublesome 9020Es at the five centers that still have them. Chicago isslated to get the first upgrade in January 1997, with the others to followat the rate of one per month through May 1997. DCC Rehost, as the projectis called, initially was conceived as an ``insurance'' program to offsetold computers reaching a critical state before broader center upgradesbegin in 1998.   On August 1, 1995, DOT Secretary Pena cashed in the insurance policy andannounced that the Rehost program would proceed. Essentially, the Rehostprogram uses new hardware to operate the software currently running on the9020E. If all goes according to schedule, the Rehost will serve as aBand-Aid until the $1.1-billion Display System Replacement (DSR) programbegins to replace center hardware and software in 1998. In 2001, the FAAplans to upgrade DARC to make it a more robust and automated back-up; andin 2002, ARTCC host computers will be replaced to increase capacity.   Other FAA initiatives triggered by the rash of service interruptionsinclude reviewing and updating contingency plans at all centers, retrainingcontrollers on making the transition to back-up systems, training moretechnicians to work on the old equipment, and adding more controllers atChicago Center.   Controllers themselves look on promised computer fixes with a jaundicedeye. ``In the corporate world, most King Airs fly with two pilots, eventhough they can be operated by one,'' observes Mark Scholl, who heads theNational Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) union shop at ChicagoCenter. ``The FAA doesn't staff a facility like you'd staff an airplane.We're staffed for the best sunny day in July, not an emergency.''   Citing years of delays in the former advanced automation system,controllers at Chicago Center say they doubt the Rehost program or the DSRwill happen as scheduled. ``[Adding staff] is a concrete thing that willhelp,'' according to Bryan Zilonis, another NATCA representative inChicago. ``Computers are just another promise, and we've heard thatbefore.''   Whether it's new computers, new people, or a combination of both thatprovides the fix, everyone involved with the ATC system agrees thatadditional service interruptions are likely-at least for the next year. Thetransition to back-ups often is seamless, but prudence dictates thatflightcrews, like controllers, take a little extra time to review theircontingency plans.   ``You just have to remind yourself that it's a possibility,'' Burkeadvises pilots. ``You need to sit up, listen up and be prepared.''Illustration(s):Illustration: Chart: Operational AvailabilityIllustration: ARTCC Equipmnt ConfigurationTable: Summary of Major Interruptions at ARTCCS (This table is notavailable eletronically.

Parke   Business is thriving for most of the dedicated business-aviation FBOs inthe Chicago area.   A score or more of fine airports that offer services to corporateaircraft of every sort dot the Chicago area, but a half dozen in theimmediate vicinity of Chicago's business centers get the bulk of thebusiness. Each of these closer airfields has 5,000-plus-foot runways andsuitable instrument approaches, plus other accommodations for largercorporate aircraft. And perhaps surprisingly, for many crews headed forChicago, there is no better destination than that mother of all humongousairports, O'Hare International (KORD).THAT MAMMOTH O'HARE   In spite of O'Hare's consistently leading the list of the world'sairports with the largest number of movements per year and havingoccasional, vastly inconvenient ATC failures, many pilots appreciate itscontrollers for their precise communications and handling. For the mostpart, flightcrews appreciate their grasp of corporate aircraft needs.   ``Best in the world,'' said one corporate pilot munching popcorn freshfrom the O'Hare Signature Flight Support popcorn machine while otheraircrew members nodded approval. ``They know that we need to stay aloft,and they cooperate. All you have to do is your standard homework and staywith them, and you're in and out fast. We have fewer delays here than we doat other smaller airports. And when feasible, they will land us close tothe general-aviation area.''   Runways 9R (10,141 feet) and 4R (8,071 feet) feed directly into thecorporate-aviation parking area in the southeast corner of the vast complexwhere Signature Flight Support provides services.   Several flightcrew members gave particular credit for their satisfactionwith ORD to the squeaky clean, spacious Signature facilities. They toutedthe usual crew amenities such as lounge rooms and rest areas, in additionto the Signature specialties of loaner cars and fresh popcorn.   Managed by Michael Brasier, the O'Hare FBO provides a large parking rampwith plenty of overflow room nearby. On-site deicing is available. Accessfrom parking to the Signature reception area is through a tightly guardedsecurity gate. This can be cleared by a van driven by a Signaturerepresentative, or a limousine can pick up or deliver passengers ifaccompanied by a Signature representative.   Also, Signature's fleet of vans picks up and delivers corporate-aircraftpassengers connecting with commercial flights.   The Signature reception desk handles orders and services, and explainsthe Signature Prime Rate II formula for fuel pricing.   A helipad is located near the general-aviation area and is used forcharter flights to outlying business centers and by several corporationsthat operate frequent shuttle services from O'Hare to business headquarterson the fringes of Chicago.   Landing fees at O'Hare for FAR Part 91 operations are set at $2.59 perthousand pounds maximum landing weight, and slightly lower for Part 135operators.ON TO THE MIDWAY   Midway Airport (KMDW) offers miles of runways, four precisionapproaches, two full-service FBOs and 40 minutes driving time to downtownChicago. Located 15 miles southeast of O'Hare, Midway is still the airportof choice for many corporate operators.   KMDW features eight runways, each over 5,000 feet, three with ILSapproaches and one runway-22L-with an MLS, assuring landings under mostadverse weather conditions.   Situated in one of the industrial parts of town, Midway is surrounded bylow-profile commercial structures. The area generates relatively few noisecomplaints and, consequently, is favored by regional airlines as well as bycorporate operators.   Several large Chicago-based corporations have built their own hangar andservice areas on the field.   Until three years ago, regional-airline traffic had grown to a volumewhere a mandatory slot system had become necessary. This was dropped whenseveral airlines ceased operations. Recently, Southwest Airlines (as wellas several other carriers) established operations at Midway, and plans fora new airline terminal are under way. At the same time, there is talk ofreinstating the slot system.   Signature at KMDW, which is managed by Brent Nielson, is in a largehangar complex on the west side of the airport. The Signature FBO providesall the standard services including on-site deicing, and is the onlygeneral-aviation FAA repair station on the airport.   All of the Signature trademark specials are in evidence: flight-planningservices, crew cars, lounge and rest areas, popcorn and mountain bikes.(Demand for mountain bikes has been light, however.)Just next door is the Million Air facility managed by Michael Kieffer. Theramp and reception areas are large and welcoming.   Monarch Air Service, also on the west side of the airport, is the basefor Duncan Avionics. Monarch, which is the oldest FBO on the airport,services many of the lighter aircraft.   Landing fees are pegged at $2.55 per thousand pounds max landingweight.AURORA: OFF THE BEATEN TRACK   Aurora Municipal Airport (ARR) with its 6,500-foot east-west ILS Runway9 is a good example of an airfield thriving by virtue of itsout-of-the-mainstream location (30-nm southwest of O'Hare). Also, it isoften preferred for its easy access to Chicago business districts via Route88. In addition, ARR is praised by customers for its FBO services andfacilities, as well as for being in the epicenter of nearby industrialdevelopment. (A Toyota distribution plant is within sight.)   There are no landing fees, only parking and tiedown charges.   Aurora is much admired and supported by its community. Frequent civicevents and traditional celebrations take place at the clean andwell-ordered airport. Credit for much of this feeling of good will must goto Airport Director Robert Rieser, a promotion-oriented administrator whoalways has his eye on ways to make the airport more useful to thecommunity.   Rieser has prepared a complete ``Summary of Economic Impacts of AuroraAirport'' and a ``Request for Special Funding for Aurora Airport.'' Bothdocuments stress the benefits of the airport, as he sees them, and presenta case for building a new 6,500-foot Runway 15-33, and related taxiways.   His case would seem to be supported by the dramatic increase inturbine-powered aircraft operations at the airport since the opening of thepresent 6,500-foot runway six years ago.   Two FBOs handle the burgeoning traffic. Lumanair Aviation Services wasestablished in 1960 by the Luman family and is run by Mike Luman, an activepilot. In addition to a full range of business-aviation services, Lumanairoperates an FAA repair station and charter business. Lumanair is a Phillips66 Performance Center.   Viking Express also operates a busy FBO at ARR-with storage hangars,charter and air freight. Robert Burwell, the company's president, claimsViking's fuel prices are 25 percent below the average in the Chicagoregion.DuPAGE: A NEW LOOK   Architectural modesty is not what the new DuPage Airport (DPA) ad-ministration and services building is all about. The glass-walled,three-story structure towers over the ramp at the northwest end of Runway1L. Thomas H. Fawell, airport director, boasts there is nothing in the newDuPage Airport environment that calls for modesty.   Indeed, this general-aviation airport with its 5,100-foot ILS runwaypositioned 25-nm west of O'Hare, is determined to attract corporateoperators (as well as small airlines). To accomplish this goal, the DuPageAirport Commission constructed imposing buildings and integrated allservices such as fueling and maintenance through a central reception centerin the administration building-DuPage Flight Center. Further, theCommission built an 18-hole golf course and business-meeting center nextdoor.   According to Fawell, since its opening in 1994, the golf course andbusiness center already are contributing about a half-million dollars ayear to the operation of the airport, which is expected to be profitable atleast by the year 2000.   Transient aircraft traffic is increasing daily as the policy of noservice charges or landing fees becomes well known. Fawell also expects theheavy investment in modern snow removal and deicing equipment to beginpaying off as more aircraft divert to DuPage after the efficacy of itsequipment proves itself.   ``We have more sophisticated ice removal and snow-removal equipment persquare foot of runway than O'Hare,'' says Fawell.   Requests for maintenance and other services may be made directly toDuPage Flight Center, the focal point of the airport. The staff will thenact as a guide to the wide range of FBO services available at the airport.   In addition to being a Phillips 66 Performance Center, avionics salesand repair, major and minor airframe and powerplant maintenance as well asfixed and rotary wing charter are all available on the airport through theDuPage Flight Center. Among the crew benefits offered by DuPage FlightCenter is a complete exercise room with adjoining lounge and quiet rooms.PALWAUKEE: THE NECESSARY OPTION   Palwaukee Municipal Airport (KPWK) sits in the middle of a busy shoppingand light-industry area, a mere eight-nm north of O'Hare. The extendedcenter line of its Runway 16 ILS just about bisects the area betweenO'Hare's Runways 14L/32R and 4L/22R. Takeoffs on KPWK Runway 16 are limitedto aircraft that have a standard turn radius of less than 5,000 feet. Anote on the Palwaukee Two SID says, ``This [turn radius] will ensureseparation from the Runway 14R final approach course'' at O'Hare.   It is certainly true that occasionally, movements at Palwaukee are atight squeeze with its neighbor to the south. But for hundreds of operatorseach year, KPWK is the airport offering the best service in the area.   Many long-time operators at Palwaukee say the principal reason for suchenduring respect and admiration is Priester Aviation, the major FBO andveteran service provider on the airport. Charlie Priester, who founded theoperation and owned the airport in 1952, still is a part-owner and dailyworker. In 1986, he sold the airport and a large part of the Priesteroperation to the local community. Today, his son, Mike, is a part of thestill-growing Priester activities at the airport, although the majorityownership is held by a small group of investors. These backers includeRichard Ferris, former chairman of United Airlines, Arnold Palmer,celebrity golf pro, and Mark McCormack, head of a management corporation.   On an average day, the ramp area outside the Priester operation oftenresembles the corporate-aircraft display area at an NBAA convention.Elsewhere on the airport, new hangars are under construction.   Another construction project at KPWK will add more clear area at eachend of the 5,100-foot Runway 16/34. The planned improvements also willallow the Runway 16 ILS localizer, which is now offset three degrees, to becentered, resulting in lower minimums.   Because of an increase in international flights by its customers,Priester arranged with U.S. Customs to establish a special clearancefacility paid for by Priester and by arriving international flights, at theairport. Other improvements include the planned construction of a new towerand a new Priester reception/administration building in an area beingcleared in the northeast corner of the airport.   Priester imposes a minimum fuel-service charge, combined with afuel-discount price program. According to Mike Pryor, Priester marketingmanager, the service charge is rarely imposed, since the minimum fuelpurchase is almost invariably met.   Priester is not noted for promotions or gimmicks to entice customers.But, the company does have its One-Stop Check-In program. Here is how itworks: After appropriate screening and suitable notification, aircraft crewpersonnel can simply check in at the Priester reception desk and pick uptwo keys. One is for the rental car waiting outside (with all paperworkhaving been completed), and the second is for a pre-registered room in anearby hotel.   The other FBOs on the airport-American Flyers, predominantly a flightschool, and Service Aviation-attract primarily piston aircraft.WAUKEGAN: `PRESIDENTIAL SERVICE'   Waukegan Regional Airport (UGN), 25-nm north of O'Hare and 17-nm northof Palwaukee, is outside the heavy airway-traffic zone of close-in Chicagoairports. However, it is near enough to downtown Chicago to be easilyreached by ground transportation. An additional incentive for using UGN isits proximity to Chicago's Gold Coast, the string of upscale towns andresidential areas along the western shore of Lake Michigan, north ofChicago.   The airport has an ILS on Runway 23, plus a complex of administrationand reception buildings on the south side of the field. On the northwestcorner sits an impressively long row of ``high-tail'' individual hangars toaccommodate a flock of aircraft owned by major corporations in the area.   Airport services are dominated by DB Aviation and its founder, CEO andpresident Daniel A. Bitton.   Bitton recently acquired most of the other FBOs on the field, includingthe former Trans Air Aviation and Byrne Aviation, and rolled their fuelservice, avionics repair and maintenance capabilities into DB Aviation FBO,a wholly owned subsidiary of DB Aviation.   DB Aviation's goal is epitomized in its presidential-service logo. ForBitton, this is no idle promotional gambit. The simulated presidential sealis a reminder to all employees that they must reach for perfection incarrying out their jobs.MEIGS: CHICAGO'S HOMETOWN AIRPORT   For many of those attending a convention at Chicago's huge McCormackPlace, a sports event at Soldier Field, or a meeting in any one of theChicago lakefront office buildings, the most convenient arrival is byaircraft into Meigs Field. Meigs, practically in downtown Chicago's lap,consists of a single, 3,899-foot, north-south VFR runway, a large parkingramp and a pleasant reception/administration building. Signature FlightSupport is the FBO, managed by Sharon Lockhart. The airport occupies anarrow strip along the eastern perimeter of Chicago's busy downtown andLake Michigan. From Meigs, a taxi ride can have you in the heart of thecity in 10 minutes.   Meigs, with its restricted visual approach procedure, is essentially VFRonly. A VASI provides three-degree vertical guidance. The airport iscompletely closed between 2200 and 0600 hours local.   Many corporate-aircraft operators with medium to large aircraft prohibitoperations at the airport except in emergencies.   In spite of its limitations, the airport regularly logs over 10,000movements a year. According to a Chicago city estimate, most of these arefrom travel initiated by people who are conducting business in downtownChicago.   A landing fee of $2.25 per thousand pounds is imposed at Meigs, and adaily parking fee of the same amount is charged after the first 30minutes.   The airport was constructed on a landfill site originally used for theWorld's Fair of 1933. Following the Fair, the land was turned over to theChicago Park District and, in 1946, it was leased to the city to build anairport. The lease expires in September, and the city is not planning torenew it. Many business people and aviation organizations are vigorouslyresisting such a move.MILWAUKEE: CLAIMING A PRESENCE   Milwaukee's airport authority loudly claims that General MitchellInternational Airport (KMKE) should be recognized as Chicago's third majorairline facility. But most corporate- aviation operators have a differentperspective. For conducting business in the Milwaukee area or in case of aneed to divert, it is nice to know that KMKE-with four precision approachesand Category II and III capability- is only 57-nm north of O'Hare.   A first-class, full-service Signature Flight Support facility, managedby Jerry Grabner, is on the east side of the field.

Donald Bateman, AlliedSignal Commercial Avionics Systems' chiefengineer of Flight Safety Systems, has an iron stomach, which is anessential part of his job description. Bateman has pored over hundreds ofcontrolled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) accident reports to find out whyflightcrews flew otherwise well-working airplanes into the ground,frequently snuffing out the lives of all on board.   ``You're 20 times more likely to be involved in a CFIT accident than amid-air collision,'' Bateman claims. Armed with those statistics, he hasbeen in the forefront of GPWS development for more than 26 years.   GPWS, mandated by the federal government two decades ago on airliners,didn't enter service as pilots' favorite avionics box on board theaircraft. Early systems were simplistic aural warning devices, highly proneto nuisance or false alarms because they merely reacted to inputs frombarometric and radio altimeters.   During its 20-year maturation, however, GPWS has evolved into a more-effective safety system that is much less likely to ``cry wolf.'' Currentversions blend radio altimeter inputs with ILS glideslope and discretesignals from gear and flap systems in order to modulate the thresholds atwhich warnings occur. The intent is to eliminate most nuisance alarms.However, enough false alarms still occur to cause some pilots to discountGPWS warnings.   Purely reactive GPWS has another problem: It can't look ahead at terrainto help the pilot anticipate having to fly an avoidance maneuver. As aresult, the aircraft has to fly in close proximity of the terrain prior toreceiving a GPWS alert.   Bateman's latest project is Enhanced GPWS, about which we first reportedin B/CA's June 1994 issue (``Enhancing GPWS Data,'' page 82). In contrastto first-generation, reactive ground prox boxes, EGPWS will anticipateterrain hazards well before they pose a threat to the aircraft. The systemprovides both an aural alert and a visual display of proximate terrain onan EFIS screen or a weather radar indicator.   EGPWS retains the well-proven, reactive ground proximity warningfunctions of older generation GPWS thus making possible FAA certificationof the new system under the existing TSO regulation.   EGPWS uses ARINC 453, the weather radar data bus, to send full-colorterrain graphics to display systems, because it's the most common graphicsinterface. As a result, weather radar graphics or terrain imagery may bedisplayed on a screen, but not simultaneously. Some display systems can beconfigured (at the option of the buyer) to automatically switch to terrainimagery in the event of a terrain alert. Certain display systems also canbe configured to automatically change range scale to 10 miles to help crewsfocus on the location of the terrain hazard if a terrain alert occurs.TERRAIN DATABASE   AlliedSignal engineers obtained a global-terrain elevation model fromthe U.S. Department of Commerce. The model divides most of the Earth'ssurface into 30-arc-second blocks-equivalent to one-half-mile squares atthe equator. The exceptions are countries that, for military securityreasons, don't want to release details of their terrain contours to thepublic.   Omitted from the terrain elevation database, for example, is informationabout North and South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, southern Japan andOkinawa, as well most South American countries with borders in the AndesMountains. Most of Africa, however, along with Russia, Mongolia and Chinaare included, as well as North America and Europe.   The terrain-elevation model, nonetheless, is enormous in size--farlarger than the database storage capacity of any civil-production digitalavionics system. Bateman's team of engineers solved the storage-capacityproblem by limiting the use of the high resolution, 30-arc-second terrainelevation blocks to circular areas within a 16-mile radius of databaseairports. In the 16- to 30-mile rings from the airports, the terrainelevation divisions are compressed into one-minute blocks-one-half the datadensity of the terrain data closest to the airports. From 30 to 60 miles,two-minute terrain blocks are used. Outside of 60 miles, the terrain modelis compressed into four-arc-minute blocks. The logic is that civil aircraftaren't likely to operate close to the Earth's surface except when departingor approaching landing facilities.   Pilots will find EGPWS's airport database impressive and large-including all public-use and military airports with hard-surfaced orunpaved runways at least 3,500 feet long. As a result, many of the airportcircles overlap, thus providing far better than four-arc-minute resolutionover large areas. For example, most of the mountainous terrain within a120-nm radius of Aspen, Colorado is divided into 30-arc-second, one- andtwo- arc-minute blocks.   Fifty or so airports with particularly steep, proximate terrain, such asJuneau and Dutch Harbor, Alaska, will get even higher terrain blockresolution-15-arc-minute divisions, resulting in one-quarter-mile-squaremaximum block areas.AURAL ALERTS, THREAT DISPLAY   EGPWS compares the aircraft's GPS position and barometric altitude withthe location of the terrain elevation contours in the database to computepossible terrain hazards.   Caution alerts are triggered when EGPWS anticipates encountering-in oneminute or less-a terrain hazard block that is as much as 800 feet below theaircraft. A synthesized voice sounds, ``Caution, terrain.''   Similarly, warning alerts are triggered when the system predicts aterrain hazard approaching in one minute or less that is as much as 400feet below the aircraft. The system warns, ``Terrain ahead. Pull up!Terrain ahead. Pull up!'' Both the caution and warning avoidance maneuversare based on a one-quarter-g vertical acceleration.   As shown in the accompanying illustrations, the caution and warningalert envelopes are modulated as a function of aircraft ground speed,airport proximity, vertical flight path, turn radius and aircraft altitudeversus airport elevation. Bateman's goal was to produce an effective safetysystem with maximum credibility because of designed-in immunity to nuisanceor false alarms.VISUAL BACKGROUND DISPLAY   In addition to the aural and visual threat alerts, EGPWS also provides abackground terrain display on the screen when the aircraft operates withina specified, computed ground proximity envelope. The screen remains blackwhen the aircraft is in level flight, and all terrain elevations within themaximum selected display range are more than 2,000 feet below theaircraft's barometric altitude.   Relative terrain block elevations that are less than 2,000 feet belowthe aircraft are displayed in varying densities of green, yellow and red asa function of terrain elevation versus aircraft altitude. For example, whenthe aircraft is parked at the ramp in non-mountainous areas, the screenshould be flooded with 25-percent density yellow dots, indicating that allthe terrain elevations are at or above the aircraft altitude. Green isreserved for terrain elevations below the aircraft, but within 2,000 feetof its altitude. There is no background display for terrain more than 2,000feet below the aircraft, if it is in level flight.   The various elevation floors, upon which the background colors andpattern densities are based, also are modulated as a half function ofaircraft descent rate. If the aircraft is descending at 2,000 fpm, forinstance, all the background display floors are moved down by 1,000 feet.   Aural alert envelopes also trigger a visual threat display. An auralcaution alert is indicated by a hazardous block illuminated in solidyellow. The terrain block turns bright red in the event of an aural-warningalert.FLYING WITH EGPWS   In September 1995, we rode along on a EGPWS demonstration flight inAlliedSignal's Beech King Air C90. Departing from Snohomish County PaineField in Washington State, we flew up the Stillaquamish River valley, deepin the Cascade Mountains. As we approached terrain on either side of thevalley, the background display indicated its location and elevationrelative to the aircraft's position and altitude. A black corridor on thescreen indicated the location of the valley floor, thereby helping us tostay on a safe course.   Approaching a ridge line at the end of the valley that towered 1,000feet above the aircraft's altitude, EGPWS issued a ``caution terrain''alert, and the display automatically changed from 80-mile scale to 10-milescale. The gently rising terrain leading to the ridge triggered the cautionalert at three miles (about one minute away), and the correspondingelevation blocks on the screen were displayed in bright yellow. Shortlythereafter, the reactive GPWS function also alerted us to the impendinghazard. A gentle pull on the yoke and an increase in power resulted in oursafely climbing above the hazard.   After clearing the ridge, we switched to 80-mile scale and started agentle turn. We were impressed with EGPWS' ability to ``look ahead'' todistant terrain such as 10,560-feet-high Glacier Peak. This summit wasdisplayed as blocks of red on the screen because its relative elevation wasmore than 2,000 feet above the aircraft's altitude.   The most impressive feature of the system, though, was its ability toprovide a timely terrain-hazard alert as we approached the sharply risingThree Fingers peak due east of Arlington, Washington. As we flew to withinseven miles of Three Fingers, EGPWS anticipated the impending hazard. Theaural alert sounded ``caution, terrain'' and the threat display on themoving map illuminated the hazardous terrain elevation in a bright yellowblock.   We intentionally pressed closer, causing EGPWS to twice sound ``Terrainahead. Pull up!'' The display automatically changed to 10-mile scale, andthe appropriate terrain elevation blocks turned bright red.   We pulled up only enough to clear the peak by a legal 500 feet and justafter clearing it, the reactive GPWS function-the one mandated by the FAAfor airliners-warned us with a ``Terrain! Terrain!'' alert. If we had beendepending upon reactive GPWS alone for terrain avoidance, we would havenever heard the warning, and the NTSB would have sifted through thefragments looking for accident clues.   EGPWS will be standard equipment on the Gulfstream V, and severalairlines are upgrading to the system. The system, though, provides alarge-scale improvement in situational awareness that will attract theattention of many other aircraft manufacturers and business-aircraftoperators.   EGPWS currently is priced at $59,233, which is close to twice the costof standard ground prox boxes. Its ability to anticipate terrain hazards,however, and its virtual immunity to ``cry-wolf'' false alarms are aquantum technological leap over current generation GPWS.Illustration(s):Illustration: Enhanced GPWS DisplayIllustration: Enhanced GPWS - Caution and Warning Aural Alerts and ThreatDisplayCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   JET SUPPORT EMS PROGRAM (PAGE 72)Once considered an upstart, JSSI is making inroads as the only independentin the power-by-the-hour game.By:Perry Bradley   It wasn't so long ago that mention of Jet Support Services, Incorporatedwould most likely have met with a resounding, ``Who?''Not so these days. Since its launch in 1989, JSSI of Chicago has steadilyadded customers and says its portfolio of powerplants in the EngineMaintenance Systems (EMS) program-the only independent engine-maintenanceprogram in the corporate marketplace-will top 500 in the first quarter ofthis year.   As with programs offered through original equipment manufacturers(OEMs), operators pay a fixed fee into the EMS kitty based on the number ofhours they fly. In exchange, JSSI pays for scheduled and unscheduledmaintenance. In practice, the programs are slightly more complicated, butthey essentially allow operators to dial in hourly operating costs andinsure themselves against maintenance hits that are not in the budget.   JSSI's strategy for penetrating the often skeptical corporate-aviationmarket is forthright and logical: Offer more-flexible programs than thecompetitors', offer them at favorable rates, and stay focused on customerservice. And according to operators we polled, the company is succeeding onall fronts.SAFETY NET   The company provided B/CA with a complete list of its customers fromwhich we sampled a selection of operators, being careful to poll from allareas of the country and from operators of various engines for which EMS isoffered. Operators ranged from a large Fortune 500 company with 11 aircraftin the fleet to single-aircraft operators. Aircraft ranged from a SikorskyS-76 to Gulfstream IVs.   Overall, the opinion of the program was very favorable. ``On a scale ofone to 10, the lowest mark I'd give them in any category would be a nine,''commented one Falcon 10 operator.   Most operators said they view EMS as a financial-planning tool thatprovides stable budgeting, even though many said they feel the program, inthe long run, costs more than self-insuring. ``The CFO likes an insuranceprogram,'' said one. ``From a cash-flow point of view, I can't arguethat.''   Operators rated customer support as high, and most said they planned torenew at the end of their five-year terms and would recommend the programto a colleague. The criticism most often voiced was that JSSI's expertiseis deeper in finance than it is in technical support.   One of the hallmarks of JSSI's program is flexibility. Unlike OEMprograms, JSSI will insure virtually any engine. (See accompanying chart.)Service is available at any factory-authorized service center. AlthoughAlliedSignal TFE731s make up nearly 75 percent of the enrolled engines,JSSI also covers everything from Allison 250 helicopter engines toRolls-Royce Speys and Tays. Mixed-fleet operators said the ability to useonly one source to cover all their engines was a major attraction.   The company also offers operators a variety of buy-in options as anenticement to add airplanes to the program. Although the portfolio includessome new aircraft, many of the aircraft are added to the program at resale,either by brokers or by new owners. According to JSSI President RickHaskins, the typical customer is the second owner of an airplane that wasnot originally on an engine program, or it is an operator upgrading to jetequipment for the first time.   However, some operators with new aircraft are on the program. During thewarranty period, JSSI covers all scheduled maintenance, and picks upcoverage of unscheduled maintenance when the warranty expires. Because JSSIrequires operators to use factory-authorized service centers, warrantycoverage isn't affected by the program. On some engines, operators pay areduced rate during their warranty period.   Several operators we talked with put used aircraft on the program justafter buying them. The enrollment fee ranges from $15,000 to $25,000 forused aircraft; brand-new aircraft can be enrolled for $2,500. JSSI alsorequires a ``Pre-Induction Diagnostic Survey''-a thorough examination ofthe engine that runs about $2,500 for each powerplant.   JSSI lets operators buy into the program with either a lump sum thatbrings the engine up to date on the program, or through a pro-rata program.While one operator did a 100-percent buy-in, most said a major attractionwas JSSI's lower enrollment price through the pro-rata program.   Many operators said they opted for EMS because the buy-in was farcheaper than for competing OEM programs. The competitor most oftenmentioned was AlliedSignal's Maintenance Service Plan. (See``AlliedSignal's Maintenance Service Plan,'' B/CA, March 1995, page 52.) Abroker that routinely puts TFE731-powered aircraft on engine programs saidhe shops between MSP and EMS, and ``JSSI wins virtually every time. Thepro-rate makes JSSI more attractive.''   The pro-rata program is set up as follows: JSSI and the operator sharethe cost of the first of each subsequent scheduled event based on thenumber of hours on the aircraft when enrolled. For example, if an aircrafthas been flown 1,000 hours and has a 2,500-hour hot-section inspectioninterval and a 5,000-hour overhaul limit, the operator would pay 40 percentof the first hot section, and 20 percent of the overhaul. The pro-rate alsoapplies to any cycle-limited parts. JSSI covers 100 percent of allunscheduled maintenance once the contract is inked.   About half of the operators with whom we spoke added aircraft to EMS atthe time of purchase. Most said the process was straightforward. However,one operator said he ended up with some confusion over who would pay forservice bulletins. That operator, who flies a Lear 35, said in addition tohis approximately $100,000 pro-rata share of his first major periodicinspection (MPI), he also had to spend about $16,000 extra per engine onservice bulletins. Another said he ended up paying more for cycle-limitedcomponents than he thought he would have to pay.   JSSI's policy is to pay for all mandatory or recommended servicebulletins from the date the contract is signed, says Haskins. However,operators are responsible for any bulletins that pre-date the contract. Inthe event an optional bulletin is upgraded to recommended or mandatoryafter the contract is signed, JSSI shares the cost on a pro-rated basis.   Another operator with whom we spoke said he had run into a Catch-22 whenbuying a used Westwind. The previous owner was about 35-percent behind onhis payments to JSSI. The prospective buyer said his options amounted toeither paying the back balance, or letting the original contract drop andre-enrolling the aircraft-a much pricier option.   Haskins said he wasn't aware of the particular circumstance, but saidowners are required to notify JSSI in advance of a sale, and must haveaccounts paid in full before transferring their coverage. Starting January1, 1995, JSSI instituted a new policy that penalizes late payments, and EMScontracts stipulate that falling behind in payments can be construed asbreach of contract. Still, if you're considering buying an airplane on EMS,it's a good idea to make sure JSSI has been notified and that the accountis current.OEM INDEPENDENCE   Another major attraction to EMS is its independence from the enginemanufacturer, according to many of the operators. ``I was hell-bent on notgoing with another factory program,'' said a Lear 60 operator who had aLear 35 on MSP and shopped EMS versus Pratt & Whitney's factory program forthe PW305 when the flight department got the new airplane. ``I just feelbetter with a neutral party.''   Several operators said they sense an inherent conflict of interest inhaving the factory also manage maintenance of their engines. One complaintoften voiced was that money paid for factory-sponsored programs seems tosubsidize repairs to the entire fleet of engines. For instance, ADs oftenare paid for by the OEM, regardless of whether an engine is covered ornot.   Still, independence wasn't a virtue for all the customers. One Lear 35chief pilot who currently is on EMS said his first preference would be toforego the program altogether and self-insure by setting aside reserves.But if he had to pick a maintenance program, he would prefer to go with theOEM. Asked why, he said, ``JSSI's sole purpose is to make money.''The financial aspect of the arrangement generated a lot of comments.Operators were nearly unanimous in describing EMS as primarily a financialprogram, and a good one at that. However, on the technical side, there wasa stark difference of opinion.   ``As a financial tool set, it rates a 10 out of 10, but on the technicalside, they're pretty weak,'' said one operator with a fleet of aircraft onthe program. ``I'd like to be able to just call and say it's broken andhang up.'' Instead, he said he finds himself as involved in maintenance ashe would be if his company were self insured. Another operator said hethinks of JSSI as offering a clerical function.   Haskins says he's aware of the perception that the company is morefinancial than technical. He and Marla Rabin, vice president foradministration and finance, worked together in investment banking beforelaunching JSSI in 1989, with what he concedes was a limited background inaviation. One of the company's goals for this year is to hire moretechnical staff.   The technical component of JSSI is run by Karl Florian, who joined thecompany two years ago after a career with the Xerox flight department.Approximately 15 contractors work with JSSI in the field, representing thecompany at various maintenance shops where clients take engines forservice. Rep-resentatives are routinely dispatched to oversee majorscheduled events.   For unscheduled work, the severity of the problem dictates whether afield rep is dispatched or not.   ``We're very happy with our technical staff, but I think we need to putmore people in the field,'' says Haskins. ``The ideal guy shows up in hissuit and tie, but in his trunk he also has a pair of coveralls.''   While some of those surveyed said the technical side was weak, otherscomplained that it was too much a presence. Because it is an independentengine maintenance company, JSSI acts as a middle man between the operatorand the service facility. The company sends a representative to overseescheduled maintenance as well as major unscheduled events.   One operator complained that getting pre-authorization from JSSI seemedinevitably to result in delays. However, another said that JSSI'sinvolvement speeded the process. A Falcon 10 operator said parts shortagesthreatened to add significantly to downtime on an overhaul, but ``JSSI beatthe bushes, found the parts, and got my engine going again.''A chief of maintenance at a company with a Westwind in charter serviceoffered an interesting perspective. ``They'll slow a job down, but theother extreme is people who view factory programs as a blank check.'' Priorto joining the flight department, he worked with a maintenance facilitythat did a considerable chunk of work on factory-covered engines. He saidhe felt that oftentimes new parts were installed where repaired or reworkedparts would have been more cost effective. ``It's kind of like healthcare,'' he said. ``When an insurer is paying $10 for Band-Aids, that drivesthe cost up for everyone. JSSI really keeps the costs down.''IN THE TRENCHESWhen it comes to actually getting work done, operators rate JSSI's serviceas excellent. Virtually all had undergone scheduled maintenance, and manyof the operators also had needed to call on JSSI in an emergency. In onecase, an operator had an AOG at a remote Nevada airport on a weekend. ``Iwas in a conference call with JSSI and a maintenance facility within 10minutes,'' he said. ``If I was an independent and not on an insuranceprogram, I wouldn't have known where to start calling.''   Another operator had his first experience with the program even beforebuying an airplane. During a pre-purchase inspection, an engine facilitynoted vibration that was close to being outside specifications. Theprevious owner called JSSI, which authorized a fan balance. ``I'm reallyimpressed with them,'' the subsequent purchaser said. ``I becamecomfortable with them immediately.''   One operator with whom we spoke said he was new to the program and hadjust 1,700 hours (in relation to a 4,500-hour overhaul limit) on hisengines, but was experiencing chronic temperature problems on one side. Aservice facility eventually recommended an overhaul. ``JSSI said noproblem,'' he says. Another operator needed work done in the core of hisengine some 1,000 hours before the stipulated overhaul limit. JSSI not onlybacked the work, but also encouraged him to go ahead with the fulloverhaul. ``What JSSI did really gave me a favorable opinion. They jumpedin and agreed to pay for lots of extra things that weren't in thecontract,'' he said. ``They just kept making it a better deal.''   Asked about ``fine-print'' issues, few operators had any complaints.``Where there's a gray area, they seem to come down on the operator'sside,'' said one. One operator noted that his company's legal staffreviewed JSSI's contract prior to signing up, and returned it to the flightdepartment without any recommended changes.   None of the operators said they had any trouble with the paperworkaspects of the program. JSSI supplies forms that are filled out monthly.Operators simply fill in the blanks, multiplying the hours flown by thehourly fee to arrive at the total due for the month. On most of the enginesit covers, JSSI also pays for operators to participate in trend-monitoringprograms.RESALE BOOSTER   In addition to the claimed benefit they derive while on the program,many operators said they feel JSSI also pays dividends when it comes timeto sell their aircraft.   Brokers say that aircraft on engine programs tend to sell faster andoften for more money than non-covered aircraft. And aircraft value guidesgive additional credit for aircraft that have engines on insuranceprograms. The amount of the credit ranges from the value of a singleoverhaul to treating the engines as though they were zero-time.   Fletcher Aldredge, publisher of the Vref Aircraft Value Reference, saidJSSI is gaining acceptance in the marketplace, and that awareness of theprogram is increasing. ``Anything new has a major sell job, but EMS isdefinitely one of the services that's gaining acceptance,'' he said.   Several operators who had purchased used aircraft confirmed that theairplane's having been onan engine program was a factor in their decision. ``I wanted to get anairplane that was on a program especially because it was our first jet,''said one.   JSSI's flexibility extends to resale. Operators can leave the programwith the airplane, presumably recovering some of their cost in thetransaction. The transfer fee is $2,500. However, operators also can selltheir aircraft without the coverage, retaining their reserves forapplication on a new aircraft.   ``What we're doing here is leaving the dollars with the flightdepartment,'' says Haskins. ``It allows the flight department to makeproductive choices about how they want to use their assets.''   If the engine coverage is retained, JSSI gives the operator use of thereserves paid into the program, minus the company's monthly management feeand any money already expended on maintenance. The remaining balance can beapplied toward the buy-in for another aircraft or for hourly operatingfees. However, operators cannot opt for a cash rebate.   JSSI has come a long way in six years. While it's still a small company,its acceptance and list of clients is growing. A key company focus isservice. ``We want to serve our customers like they are treated in amom-and-pop type of shop as opposed to having them feel like they're just anumber,'' said JSSI's Marla Rabin. ``We want to grow, but we want to havethe mentality of a small company.''   So far, the strategy appears to be working. Said one operator,``Whenever you tell your boss to invest this kind of money, you wantassurance you've done the right thing. After a year and a half on theprogram, I'm sure we did the right thing.''JSSI LANDS A BIG ONE   Business JetSolutions, the joint venture between Bombardier and AMRCombs, recently contracted with JSSI for coverage of its FlexJetfractional-ownership aircraft.   JetSolutions compared JSSI's EMS program with OEM programs andself-insuring, concluding it was cheaper than the OEM options and onlyslightly more expensive than socking away reserves, according to DennisKeith, vice president of marketing and sales. ``We did an analysis onengine costs and reserves, and the marginal difference in cost, compared towhat JSSI can do it for was just not worth the hassle,'' says Keith. ``Itboils down to a small insurance premium.''   Another factor in selecting EMS, Keith said, is having just one vendorthat covers JetSolution's entire fleet, which includes General ElectricCF34s on the Challengers, Pratt & Whitney Canada PW305s on the Lear 60s andAlliedSignal TFE731-2s on the Lear 31As. Finally, JetSolutions felt theprograms would increase resale value of the aircraft shares, providingowners with higher residual value.   JetSolution's initial fleet includes 14 aircraft. As of mid-November1995, the company said its customer base was ``well into the doubledigits.'' As part of the JSSI agreement, aircraft owners in JetSolutions'Alliance Plus management arm also receive discounts on EMS enrollment feesand hourly rates.OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS   Rick Haskins and Marla Rabin were working in the investment-bankingbusiness when they were approached with the idea of starting an independentengine-maintenance program in late 1988. A couple of months later theyrented office space; and a year after that, they signed their firstclient.   ``We kind of wanted to try something on our own to see if all thisadvice we'd been dispensing really worked,'' Haskins says modestly. ``So wejust did it.''   Haskins serves as president of JSSI, while Rabin is vice president foradministration and finance. The third founder was Ron Zilberbrand, whoheads up the sales effort. Early on, the company was regarded as ``kind ofcute,'' Haskins says. Now, it's taken a little more seriously-both by OEMsand by operators shopping for protection against unscheduled maintenanceexpense.   ``Our market is anybody with any budget sensitivity, whether it's a hugeFortune 500 company or a little guy who's a charter operator,'' saysHaskins. ``Budget sensitivity is the critical path.''   One of the unique aspects about JSSI is its ability to cover virtuallyany turbine engine. While AlliedSignal TFE731s make up the bulk of itsportfolio, the company covers 17 different engine types, includingeverything from Turbomeca and Allison helicopter engines to Pratt & WhitneyCanada PT-6s to P&WC JT15s and AlliedSignal APUs.   How can the company handle so many engine types? For one, Director ofTechnical Services Karl Florian does extensive research with operators,OEMs and service facilities to help set hourly rates. However, just asimportant, Haskins and Rabin say, is the company's basic structure. ``Ifyou have the management systems and management techniques in place, thereshouldn't be any reason in the turbine world why you shouldn't be able tohandle an engine,'' says Haskins. The company also recently announced ajoint venture with Stevens Aviation that will provide nose-to-tail coverageof King Air 200s for a base rate of $390 per hour (B/CA, November 1995,page 28).   JSSI makes its money from enrollment fees-$2,500 for a brand-newaircraft and a range of about $15,000 to $25,000 for used aircraft-and fromextracting a management fee from the hourly charge that clients pay forengine operations. However, the remainder of the monthly fee goes into atrust that exists outside JSSI's corporate structure. JSSI can't spend themoney for corporate purposes, nor does it derive any interest income fromthe third-party irrevocable trust, which is administered by LaSalleNational Bank. The company is authorized to spend money only for enginerepair and maintenance, and carries an insurance policy that backs up thetrust.   Haskins and Rabin attribute the company's success to the flexibility ofits programs and to a strong customer-service orientation. So far,operators of some 500 engines seem to agree, and the company isexperiencing a perfect renewal record as the first of its five-yearcontracts begin to run out.   The strategy for the future is to continue to grow without forgettingwhat got them where they are today. ``The worry we have is how far and howfast we can expand without losing what got us here, and what got us here iscustomer advocacy,'' says Rabin.

His inflection wasunmistakable: ``Aren't you actually a jet?'' We imagined that he thumpedhis aging computer console a couple of times, trying to clear its digitalcobwebs, as he watched us climb out of Dulles at 240 KIAS. At 37,000pounds, the Saab 2000 admittedly was well below its 50,260 pounds MTOW,with only a few passengers on board. The relatively light weight, however,doesn't discount the Saab 2000's performance accomplishments.   The climb to FL 310 took 19 minutes from brake release, which isrespectable for a high-performance turboprop. However, without ATC delays,we would have reached that flight level in 16 minutes-more like the averagejetliner. After one minute at FL 310 in ISA+4C conditions, the Saab 2000settled into a 368 KTAS cruise while burning 1,920 pph.   After level off, we had to pull back the power levers to avoid pushingthrough the 0.62 Mach Mmo red barber pole on the primary flight display.There was plenty of energy remaining in the engines, with the power leversin the max-cruise position.   Saab's recipe for spirited climb performance and jet-like cruise speedis a classic, three-part blend: lean fuselage cross section,high-aspect-ratio wing and huge turbine engines. The fuselage cross sectionis taken from the Saab 340, but it is stretched 24 feet overall, resultingin 20.67 feet more cabin length for the passengers, and up to 120 cubicfeet more baggage volume depending on interior configuration. The wing,which is a scaled up version of the one on the Saab 340, retains its 11:1aspect ratio and relatively thick chord section.   Most of the credit for the performance gains, though, goes to theRolls-Royce Allison AE2100A turboprop engines which, at their 3,770-shpnormal takeoff rating, offer twice the power of the Saab 340's GeneralElectric CT7 engines, and even more at their 4,152-shp APR rating. Notably,both normal and APR horsepower ratings are available up to 36C (97F).LONG LEGS, SHORT HOPS   When needed, the Saab 2000 Executive Shuttle can fly 36 passengers 1,289nm with NBAA IFR reserves, at an average cruise speed of 360 KTAS,according to the aircraft operations manual (AOM). Slow down to along-range cruise speed of 280 KTAS and, if needed, you could fly more than1,600 nm.   Most missions, however, are likely to be in the 200- to 400-nm range,based on the projections of the one Executive Shuttle operator in theUnited States and the experience of Switzerland's Crossair, which now hasamassed more than 55,000 flight hours in the Saab 2000.   Short-haul missions and density-altitude performance are the Saab 2000'sstrong suits. In comparison to the Canadair RJ, the Saab 2000 burns threepercent less fuel on a 300-nm trip, but it is only seven minutes slower.The Saab 2000's fuel economy advantage, compared to the Canadair RJ's,disappears with longer-range trips, and its slower speed results innoticeably longer trip times.   The corporate operator with whom we spoke (wishing to remain anonymous)said the company looked at other 36-seat aircraft, but all were slower thanthe 295 KTAS cruise-speed turboprops they currently fly. The operatorestimates that the Saab 2000 will burn one-third less fuel and offer a75-knot speed advantage, compared to its current shuttle aircraft. The firmselected the Saab 2000 because it will save them 10 minutes to 20 minutesper leg, compared to any other 36-seat turboprop. The flight departmentruled out a 50-passenger regional jet because of longer runway requirementsand higher operating costs for its average 200-nm mission.   Fuel economy favors a jetliner-like climb/cruise/descent profile becauseit saves as much as 20 percent in fuel consumption. For example, the Saab2000 can fly 36 passengers 200 nm in 47 minutes with a block fuel burn of1,450 pounds, according to the AOM. Flying the aircraft anywhere between13,000 feet and FL 310 on such trips makes less than a one-minutedifference in trip times.   Hot-and-high airport conditions impose virtually no limitations on theSaab 2000. It can carry substantially more payload and fly longer legs withmaximum payload compared to the Canadair RJ, especially when departing fromhigh-density altitude airfields.   For example, when using the 3,770-shp normal takeoff power (NTOP) ratingand a no-flaps configuration, the Saab 2000 can depart Denver at 38C (100F)with 36 people and full fuel. The APU, however, must be used for cabinpressurization during NTOP departures because the engine bleeds are shutoff. (Using reduced, ``flex'' power for takeoff allows the engine bleeds tobe turned on.)   Crossair's experience with the Saab 2000 provides potential corporateoperators with a credible gauge of the aircraft's day-in and day-outperformance. The Swiss carrier's average trip is 400 nm, and the averageblock time is 1+15, according to Thomas Brandt, Crossair's Saab 2000 fleetchief. He told B/CA that when the Saab 2000 flies at FL 290 to 310, itcruises at 355 to 365 KTAS, depending on temperature aloft, and that theblock fuel burn for such trips is 2,400 pounds. Crossair also flies theaircraft on 800- to 1,000-nm charters, such as between Basel, Switzerlandand the Greek Islands, and between Berlin and St. Petersburg, Russia.PASSENGER ACCOMMODATIONS   Travelers accustomed to coach seats on jetliners will find slightly moreseat width on the Saab 2000. The cabin seats are 18.1 inches wide on theright, two-seat side and 18.5 inches wide on the left, single-seat side,providing about one-half to one inch more width than the average coachseat. The fuselage's circular shape and its 7.1-foot interior crosssection, however, offer less shoulder room in the window seats than thecomparatively vertical side walls of most jetliners.   The Executive Shuttle's 36-seat configuration provides the 24 rearpassengers a 34-inch seat pitch, making possible three club-seatingsections in the forward section and resulting in one inch less seat pitchin the front section.   The aircraft we flew for this report was completed by AIM Aviation,Limited of Bournemouth, England. It had leather-covered, fold-out worktables for passengers in two of the club sections, and fold-down traytables for forward-facing seats in the aft cabin. A conventional FAA Type Ientrance is located at the left front of the fuselage for passengerboarding. A folding boarding ladder, with its operation aided by countersprings, slides into the passenger door opening from a storage compartmentaft of the cockpit. There is another Type I door at the right rear side ofthe aircraft for galley servicing. Left- and right-side Type III emergencyexits are located at mid cabin.   A single lavatory is located in the forward section of the cabin. Justaft, there is a 104-cubic-foot carryon storage compartment on the rightside and a 39-cubic-foot coat closet on the left side. The ExecutiveShuttle, in contrast to the airliner configuration, has no overhead luggagecompartments adjacent to the passenger seats.   The aft galley has storage for hot and cold meal service for one servingto 36 passengers, plus hot and cold beverage storage.   In the rear section of the pressure vessel, 328 cubic feet of baggagevolume are available in two compartments that are accessible on the groundby means of a 53-by-51-inch cargo door, and in flight through a door in thegalley area. The aft baggage compartments have a capacity of 2,756 pounds.(Weight and balance data for the aircraft were not available when we flewthe aircraft, thus we could not check if loading the aft compartment tocapacity would adversely affect the center of gravity under certainconditions.)ACTIVE NOISE ATTENUATION   The Saab 2000's six-blade, Dowty Rotol props turn at only 950 rpm in allphases of flight other than takeoff. Then, they turn at a modest 1,100 rpm.Each prop, though, converts enough torque to thrust to propel the Saab 2000to nearly six miles per minute in cruise.   Saab uses a combination of dynamic vibration absorbers, acousticalinsulation and an active noise cancellation system to blot up noise andvibration, with the goal of achieving 76 dBA interior sound levels. Whilethe active and passive systems are effective, Crossair claims that thecabin sound level actually is 78 dBA, which exceeds the manufacturer'sspecification for the aircraft. Saab is developing an improved soundattenuation system for the aircraft that will be fitted to the 2000 at alater date (B/CA, September 1995, page 122).POWER VERSUS STABILITY AND CONTROL   The Saab 2000, being the most powerful turboprop ever built by SaabAircraft, posed some unique challenges during development that ultimatelyled to a one-year delay in certification. Joint Airworthiness Authoritysign-off occurred in March 1994, and the FAA certificated the aircraft inApril 1994. The first production aircraft was delivered to Crossair inAugust 1994, but it had c.g.-envelope limitations and performanceshortfalls that were corrected in later production aircraft.   Saab anticipated considerable directional control forces in the event ofan engine failure, thus it elected to fit the Saab 2000 with arudder-by-wire system to help control yaw. Early in 1992, though, Saab'sflight-test engineers also found shortcomings in longitudinal stability, sothey widened the chord of the horizontal stabilizer by seven percent. Saaboriginally planned to use a manually operated mechanical elevator controlsystem (MECS). By mid 1993, however, it became apparent that MECSlimitations would restrict the center of gravity envelope, or ``loadabilityrange'' as termed by Saab. In addition, the pitch forces associated withMECS would be considerable, especially at high speeds.   At that point in the development program, Saab elected to fit the 2000with a fly-by-wire powered elevator control system, PECS for short, that islinked to a digital flight-control computer. PECS, similar to fly-by-wiresystems fitted to fighters, allows aerodynamic stability requirements to berelaxed, thereby permitting the c.g. envelope to be extended by 50 percent,according to Saab.   PECS uses a belt-and-braces design for redundancy, including left- andright-side, dual-channel flight-control computers. These computers providethe appropriate control-yoke-to-elevator movement, which is geared toindicated airspeed, along with flap-position trim bias, speed and Machpitch trim, and g-force loading. The pitch-trim function is built into thePECS computers. There is no elevator trim tab. The system greatly reducesthe pitch-control forces because it uses springs for artificial controlfeel rather than aerodynamic control surface feedback.   The spring loaded, artificial pitch-feel system suggests thatpitch-control feel might be numb. Such is not the case. In our opinion,however, the stick forces seem nicely proportionate throughout most of theflight envelope because of the pitch-control law fidelity programmed intothe fly-by-wire computer.   The muscle to move the left and right elevators is provided by twohydraulic actuators on each side, powered by three independent hydraulicsystems. Pitch control is retained in the event of two out of threehydraulic system failures or jamming of either the right or left elevator.In addition, a hydraulic-actuated, emergency-pitch-trim actuator isconnected to the left elevator in case both dual-channel PECS computerssimultaneously fail.   P-factor is another challenge. Pilots flying the Saab 2000 will have nodifficulty in identifying the left powerplant as the critical engine,because of the clockwise prop rotation of both engines. The fly-by-wirerudder system all but eliminates yaw control problems, even when one isflying the aircraft with one-engine-inoperative. However, manual rollcontrol makes power-induced roll trim changes quite noticeable.   Vmca, as a result, is defined more by roll-control limitations than byrudder authority. Saab intends to reduce Vmca by fitting vortex generators(VGs) to the leading edges of the ailerons. The VGs will be hidden from theair flow except when the ailerons are deflected to large angles, therebyeliminating any drag penalty in cruise. The upgrade will be available bythe middle of this year.   Counter-rotating props might seem an obvious solution. Saab told B/CA,however, that such a change would be expensive to engineer, plus both theengine gear box and the propeller assemblies would be left- or right-sidespecific, thus requiring two sets of spares in inventory.   In our opinion, however, the Saab 2000 would benefit fromcounter-rotating propellers because of its prodigious horsepower and largeprop diameter.SYSTEMS DESIGN   Other systems reflect Saab's compulsion for rugged construction anddispatch reliability, about which Crossair had good things to say. With fewexceptions (such as dual nav lights) design emphasis is on componentreliability rather than component redundancy.   The airframe has a 60,000-hour/75,000-cycle design life and a 24-monthwarranty. Other components are warranted for at least 24 months, with a30-month warranty on the Dowty Rotol propellers and a 36-month warranty onthe engines.   Avionics and other systems are well integrated for diagnostic functions.(See sidebar). Many of the normal and abnormal procedures, including mostpreflight checks, are automated to reduce pilot workload.   Engines and propellers are controlled by FADECs for low pilot workloadand high reliability. (See sidebar.) The Sundstrand APU is certificated forinflight operations, and it starts automatically in the event of an enginefailure. Its three-phase, wild frequency 45kVr AC generator is identical togenerators on the engines, and it can power all electrical equipment. Mostelectrical systems are DC-powered-supplied by three transformer rectifierunits. The APU is required for dispatch because it's used to supply bleedair to start the engines.   The fuel system, similar to the Saab 340's, uses wet-wing fuel tankswith cross-feed, single-point pressure refueling (15 minutes maximum) andgravity fill functions. Extendable sight gauges in the bottom of the tanksallow the crew to crosscheck fuel quantity on preflight without having touse dipsticks. The fuel-boost pumps are located in dry canisters that allowremoval and replacement without defueling.   Three hydraulic systems powered by engine-driven and/or electric pumpssupply pressure to actuate the landing gear, wing flaps, wheel brakes,nosewheel steering and fly-by-wire rudder and elevator. The standby pumpsare located in the wing root fairings for easy access.   Bleed air is used for engine anti-ice, to inflate the deice boots on theleading edges of the wings and empennage, and to supply the dual air-cyclemachines. Electric power is used for prop, probe and windshield anti-iceheat. Rain removal is by windshield wipers.PRICE AND VALUE   The B/CA Comparison Profile compares the Saab 2000 to a compositeaverage that encompasses the Saab along with the de Havilland Dash 8-300,Fokker 50EX and Canadair RJ. The named aircraft are all able to seat 50people in airliner configuration. (The Dornier 328-110 was not includedbecause its cabin is smaller than other competitors'.)The Saab 2000 scores well on the B/CA Comparison Profile, racking upfirst-place or second-place scores in 16 of 24 categories, including theprice index in which it has a seven-percent advantage.   The aircraft carries more payload, and it carries it a longer distancethan any competitor does. Clearly, it is the fastest 50-seat turbopropcertificated for civil use. No other aircraft in the $14-million pricerange carries so many people, so far and so fast. Only the seven-passengerPiaggio P180 Avanti, for example, is faster-and it is out of production.   Although the Saab 2000 isn't as fast as a 30-seat Corporate RJ, nor doesit burn as little fuel during a 1,000-mile trip, it is at least $5-millionless expensive to buy than any jetliner of similar capacity.   Also, the Saab 2000 is one of the quietest turboprops in production, butpassengers won't confuse it for a jetliner-at least not at present.   The Saab 2000 Executive Shuttle offers the most advanced avionics suiteof any 36-seat corporate shuttle, provides highly automated systems forreduced flightcrew workload, and brings the ability to operate out of3,400-foot runways on typical 200-nm trips.   Hot-and-high airport conditions impose few takeoff weight limitations onthe Saab 2000. It's the only aircraft in the Comparison Profile that candepart from 5,000 feet on a 25C day at maximum takeoff weight.   As scheduled airline service continues to atrophy (the result of lessprofitable routes being abandoned), corporate-shuttle aircraft become moreattractive to dozens of companies with remote plants and subsidiaries. Withspeed and interior sound levels approaching those of a jet, short fieldperformance that is competitive with other turboprops' and virtuallyunrestricted hot-and-high performance, the Saab 2000 provides one of thebest alternatives to chartering an airliner full time.FLYING IMPRESSIONS   With the exception of its aircraft flight manual (AFM) and thetwo-volume AOM, the Saab 2000 offers more ease-of-use features for pilotsthan the competitive aircraft.   These three tomes should be carried on the aircraft because of thepaucity of information provided by the AFM alone. The FAA-approved AFM, forexample, lacks step-by-step emergency procedures needed for continuing atakeoff in the event of an engine failure just after V1. Those vital stepsare contained in the non-FAA-approved AOM.   In our opinion, the checklist-as an extension of the AFM-is equallyincomplete with respect to procedures. The AOM provides both technicaldescription of the systems and amplified procedures needed for certainemergency and abnormal conditions.   No set of aircraft manuals that we can remember dilutes proceduralinformation over so many pages of text.   Once strapped into the cockpit, though, pilots will find plenty ofwell-thought-out automation to ease the workload. A clearance-deliveryfeature, for example, powers the right radio-tuning unit and VHF com 2transceiver from the center battery bus. Start the APU, and power isautomatically supplied to the avionics. The FMS provides the cabin-pressurecontroller with the destination field elevation.   However, the current production Collins FMS 4100 is limited. It storesonly two flight plans. There are no provisions for weight calculations and/or fuel-flow predictions. The TSO C129 A2 GPS only is authorized for enroute and terminal operations.   The APU supplies plenty of bleed air through the dual air-cycle machinesto quickly heat or cool the cabin. Our calculated V-speeds for a41,000-pound takeoff weight, including full fuel and three passengers, were116 knots for takeoff decision and rotation speeds, and 122 for the takeoffsafety speed-within two knots of the Vmc limited takeoff V-speeds. Afterengine start, we quickly moved the condition levers from the ``start''position (in which the 12.5-foot, six-blade props remain feathered) to the770 rpm, ground idle ``run'' position. This was done to reduce buffetingand vibration in the cabin.   Our computed takeoff distance was 3,450 feet. After aligning theaircraft on the runway, we pushed the takeoff/go-around mode annunciatorand then advanced the power levers to the detent. Engine response wasdecidedly crisp, and the aircraft surged forward with an initialacceleration that few civil aircraft can match.   Pitch force with PECS was light and well balanced, but roll control washeavy in comparison, significantly detracting from control harmony. Powerchanges produced quite noticeable roll changes, requiring aileron inputsand roll-trim changes.   Our initial rate of climb was 2,500 fpm at 190 KIAS. We lowered the nosefor better forward visibility and accelerated to 240 KIAS. Twelve minuteslater, including pauses for ATC restrictions, we passed through FL 180 witha climb rate of 1,700 fpm. Again because of ATC restrictions, our initialcruise altitude was FL 250, which we reached in 13 minutes with a totalfuel burn of 980 pounds. We accelerated to 365 KTAS in ISA+6C conditionswith a fuel burn of 2,150 pph.   Later, we were cleared to climb to FL 310, reaching it 19 minutes afterdeparture. Using 62-percent power, we accelerated to 370 KTAS while burning2,040 pph in ISA+5C conditions. Total fuel burn for the climb was 1.390pounds. At that point, we had to reduce power to avoid exceeding the 0.62Mmo redline.   Steep turns in the Saab 2000 bring out a little numbness in the PECSpitch feel, but in normal maneuvering the fly-by-wire system has a natural,proportionate feel. Recovery from clean and dirty stalls is aided by astick-pusher system. Holding the stick back after the stick pusher firesresults in a gentle left-wing roll off because of P-factor, even at flightidle.   Simulated OEI conditions bring out the Saab 2000's unique handlingcharacteristics. Directional control requires very little rudder pedalinput because of the rudder-by-wire system. Roll control through the manualailerons, though, requires more of an iron fist approach, especially atslow speeds and high power settings. Once the aircraft accelerates to 160KIAS or power is reduced, roll control forces become greatly reduced, andthey are easily counteracted with roll trim.   Our computed landing distance, based on a 37,000-pound arrival weight,was 3,700 feet with a 112- KIAS Vref, based on Vmo limits. The aerodynamicVref, based on 1.3 Vso speed, was 107 KIAS.   Landing the aircraft requires some finesse because of its comparativelystiff struts. After touchdown, we pulled the power levers back to flightidle, then up and over into the ground-idle position. Pulling the leversback farther against spring tension activates reverse thrust, which iseffective in slowing the aircraft on slippery surfaces.   Our total fuel burn for the 1+07, 333-nm, great-circle-distance trip was2,790 pounds.ROLLS-ROYCE ALLISON AE2 100 ENGINES   Few turboprop engines can match the dispatch reliability, fuelefficiency and digital-control sophistication of the AE2100. The propgearbox, adapted from the venerable T56 engine that powers the U.S. NavyGrumman E2C and P3C Orion, has a 30,000-hour mean time between repair. Thegas generator, shared with the AAS3007 turbofan, is sized for 6,000-shpapplications. As a result, the gas generator has a 125C temperature marginfor the AE2100C at its normal takeoff power rating of 3,770 shp.   The 14-stage, axial flow compressor has variable inlet guide vanes andfive stages of variable stators that are controlled by the full-authoritydigital engine control (FADEC). The rotor blades and stator vanes aresteel, for FOD resistance and low erosion.   Downstream of the effusion-cooled, annular combustor are twohigh-pressure turbine stages to drive the compressor, and two low-pressureturbines that power the prop gear box. The engine's modular constructioneases maintenance chores, and most routine inspections can be done with aconventional tool box.   The FADECs not only control all the gas generator functions, but theyalso are linked to the prop-control units, enabling the engine to be fittedwith single-power-lever controls. On the ground or in flight, the FADECskeep the props virtually in perfect synchronization, even during prop speedtransitions.   Five annunciator buttons select the appropriate rpm and power ranges forvarious phases of flight: takeoff/go-around, max continuous power, climb,cruise and flex power. The latter mode allows the use of reduced- powertakeoffs that lower thermal stress on the engine, and result in a morecomfortable acceleration rate for the passengers.SAAB 2000 AVIONICS   The Saab 2000 has the most sophisticated avionics system ever installedin a turboprop regional aircraft, not only because of its power, but alsodue to the way it ties into so many other aircraft systems.   Six, 7.25-inch Collins Pro Line 4 EFIS tubes occupy most of the Saab2000's instrument panel, including primary and secondary EICAS screensinboard of the left- and right-side primary flight and navigation displays.The amount of information that can be displayed almost seems more thanwhat's needed-and that's intentional. If one tube should fail, the aircraftcan be dispatched with the five remaining displays, providing that thedisplay can be moved to one of the center EICAS positions.   The panel layout enhances hand-eye coordination. Directly above thedisplays is a central, flight-guidance control panel, flanked by left- andright-side radio-tuning units and display controllers. EFIS reversionswitches are located on the overhead panel.   A Collins Integrated Avionics Processing System (IAPS) forms the hub ofthe well-proven, hub-and-spoke, ARINC 429-linked Pro Line 4. Left- andright-side data concentrator units (DCUs) receive inputs from analog anddigital engine and systems sensors, translate the data into ARINC 429 andforward it to the IAPS for processing and display on the EICAS.   Both DCUs are required for dispatch, and there is no provision for athird, onboard spare.   The Collins FMS 4100 flight management systems are optional. In ouropinion, these boxes offer less power and fewer features than competitiveFMS units and newer Collins designs.   This year, the avionics system will be upgraded to Version 6.0. The FMSwill be improved, HUD will be added as an option, and enhanced GPS sensorswill be installed.

Designers attempt to give aircraft exceptional capabilities in allareas-including price-but the laws of physics do not allow one aircraft todo all missions with equal efficiency. Tradeoffs are a reality of aircraftdesign.   In order to obtain a feeling for the strengths and compromises of aparticular aircraft, B/CA compares the subject aircraft's performance tothe composite characteristics of aircraft in its class. We averageparameters of interest for the aircraft that are most likely to beconsidered as competitive with the subject of our analysis, and then wecompute the percentage differences between the parameters of the subjectaircraft and the composite numbers for the competitive group as a whole.Those differences are presented in bar-graph form, and the absolute valueof the parameter under consideration, along with its rank with respect tothe composite, are given.   For this Comparison Profile, we present selected parameters of the Saab2000 in relation to a competitive group consisting of the CanadairCorporate Jetliner, the de Havilland Corporate Dash 8-300 and the FokkerExecutive F50. It should be understood that this Comparison Profile ismeant to illustrate relative strengths and compromises of the subjectaircraft; it is not a means of comparing specific aircraft to each other.Illustration: Graph: Time and Fuel Versus Distance. Time and Fuel Versus Distance-This graph shows the plot of two missions: the first flown atmaximum-speed cruise and the second at long-range cruise. The numbers atthe hour lines indicate cumulative miles and fuel burned for each of thetwo profiles. The intermediate points on these lines are accurate only forthe full trip; however, they can provide the user with a rough idea of thetime and fuel required for trips of intermediate length. For example, theSaab 2000 can carry a 7,200-pound payload, representative of 36 passengers,more than 1,200 miles at high-speed cruise. Flying at an average long-rangecruise speed of 289 KTAS results in a range of about 1,600 miles with thesame payload.Illustration: Graph: Specific Range. Specific Range-The specific range ofan aircraft, the ratio of nautical miles flown to pounds of fuel burned(nm/lb), is a measure of its fuel efficiency. This graph shows specificrange values at three altitudes at a mid-range cruise weight of 44,000pounds. For example, the Saab 2000 cruising at 360 KTAS at FL 310 at thisweight achieves an SFC of 0.19 nm/lb. Note how pronounced the SFC curve isfrom long-range cruise to high-speed cruise at each of the three chartedaltitudes.Illustration: Graph: Range/Payload Profile. Range/Payload Profile-Thepurpose of this graph is to provide rough simulations of trips under avariety of payload and airport density altitude conditions, with the goalof flying the longest distance. For the Saab 2000, we have used high-speedcruise instead of long-range cruise for all weights. The payload lines,which are intended for gross simulation purposes only, are each generatedfrom end points. Time and fuel burns, shown at the top of the chart, areplotted for individual one-, two- and three-hour missions published in theaircraft operating manual. For example, the Saab 2000 can carry a7,200-pound payload (36 passengers) more than 1,200 nm withoutdeparture-airport density altitude limitations. Remember, the runwaydistances are based on the 100-percent normal takeoff power of 3,770 shpand flaps 15-not the reduced flex power setting of 91 percent used for thespecifications box.Photograph(s):Photograph: The Saab 2000's lineage is immediately apparent.

The irony of the situation is that all these folks will be paid fortheir enforced vacation, so they might just as well have stayed on thejob.   Part of the blame can be affixed on House Speaker Newt Gingrich.Returning aboard Air Force One from the funeral services for Israeli PrimeMinister Yitzhak Rabin, he was relegated to the coach section and enjoinednot to use the forward lav.20 His Speakership took extraordinary umbrage at this presidential snub,and vented his political petulance in the Halls of Congress by being anobstacle to progress. He slowed the settlement of the stalemate ofbudgetary differences between the Republicans and Democrats, a.k.a. Doleversus Clinton.20 The pundits who cover and chafe at the Washington scene called it adraw. Madam Rivkin, who is in charge of our moneybags, hinted that it mighthave been necessary to shut down our ATC system. Of course, this was merelysabre rattling. But one thing she did is a puzzlement. In order to keepcertain vital functions of the government running, she transferred $62billion from the Civil Service retirement fund to the OMB.20 Not only is it astonishing that one person or department possessessuch fiscal clout, but I was under the false impression that retirementfunds-especially government ones-were sacrosanct. It also beggars thequestion as to whence cometh the funds to send $12 billion to Mexico. (Thisextrapolates out to $500 for every citizen in the U.S.A.)   Hersch, what do you think of our chances of being repaid for this``loan''? Perhaps about as good as getting repaid the dough we were owedfrom World War I?Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the government goslings are flapping theirgalluses over what to do about the FAA. The only area of agreement is thatsomething needs to be done about it. Republican Senator John McCain'saddled overview is that reformation is the answer. Among his convolutedproposals is a special tax on business jets and an easement on airlinefees.20 In my humble opinion, the most sensible reform is to make the FAA anindependent agency, headed by a strong leader with extended tenure,supported by a knowledgeable committee that would receive director fees formonthly meetings rather than full-time employment. This would attract somereal talent. Most of this proposal is embodied in HR 2276, which was beforethe House at press time.20 Spearheading the opposition, nach, is Secretary Federico Pea, whosepower will be heavily diminished by loss of authority over the 50,000 soulsoverseeing the governance of the FAA.20 As an independent agency, the FAA could function vastly moreefficiently to update equipment and modus operandi. The present air trafficcontrollers should be awarded medals for their exceptional handling ofheavy traffic with some equipment older than my dog tags. Recent failuresof equipment in Oakland, Chicago and New York breed only contempt for thepresent arduous process of equipment replacement. Little consolation can bedrawn from the fact that no two aircraft have come together as a result ofthese dreadful and completely unnecessary outages. Pilot skills, pilotskills.WIND SHEAR CAN KILL   A few weeks back, a good friend-who is a Learjet owner and an avidgolfer-underwent serious shoulder surgery; his second. The cause of thisdiscomfiture was the result of a Mohawk Airlines crash at Rochester, NewYork in July 1963. The Mohawk 404 took off in the teeth of a severethunderstorm and, as it lifted off, it encountered wind shear and crashed.I believe the fatalities were the pilot and two others, with injuries toalmost all passengers.20 My friend suffered a severe broken shoulder and other injuries. Theparaphernalia installed in his shoulder permitted him to resume golf a yearor two later. The pins and whatnot finally failed, occasioning thesubsequent surgery.20 Now comes the good news: Several avionics manufacturers havecertificated-or will soon certificate-airborne wind-shear detecting radar.It took only 32 measly years to come up with this equipment. I do not faultthe avionics manufacturers for the delay because it has been the FAA'sresponsibility to research the problem.20 It is outrageous, in my view, that it took a full generation todevelop this vital equipment, especially since we have had airborne radarfor over 40 years.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   WHO SHOULD SEE YOUR TRAINING RECORD?Government must proceed with caution as it explores wider access topilot-training records.By:David Collogan   Recently, B/CA urged the FAA to look favorably upon an expected NTSBrecommendation seeking to assure the free exchange of training andcompetency information involving applicants for pilot positions.   The NTSB's intent is rational: to prevent air carriers from passingalong inept pilots from company to company. But, the implementation of sucha rule is fraught with potential mischief.   Conceptually, the issue should simply be that of protecting the aircarriers from civil suit when they pass on unflattering, but safety-relatedtraining information. However, the NTSB recommendation, in its final form,seems to avoid simplicity in favor of building another bureaucracy.   The Safety Board proposes that airlines and private training companies be required to collect and provide the FAA with a paperwork mountain ofinformation on how pilots perform during training. Specifically, the NTSBsaid those private enterprise businesses should ``maintain pertinentstandardized information on the quality of pilot performance in activitiesthat assess skills, abilities, knowledge and judgment during training,check flights, initial operating experience and line checks.''   The NTSB also wants the FAA to require airlines and training firms ``toprovide the FAA, for incorporation into a storage and retrieval system,pertinent standardized information'' on those same pilot performanceparameters, which airlines should use for ``evaluating applicants for pilotpositions . . .'' These recommendations fail the smell test at every step:   -- While private businesses must keep detailed training records fortheir own purposes, they should not be responsible for collecting suchinformation for the federal government.   -- The mere existence of such a federal database has terrible potentialfor misuse.   -- A cost/benefit analysis would show that such a record-keeping systemwould cost millions of dollars and provide few, if any, safety benefits.   -- Adoption of this element in the Board's suggestions would subjectairlines and training companies to never-ending lawsuits and focus theirattention on the legalities of record-keeping instead of the quality oftheir training programs.   It's important that you should know the background in case you missed itin our December 1995 issue (Viewpoint, page 3). This all resulted from theSafety Board's investigations into several recent pilot-error accidents,the latest of which was the AMR Eagle/Flagship Airlines Jetstream crash inNorth Carolina 13 months ago-the same accident that spawned the so-called``one level of safety'' rule the FAA issued in December 1995.   The NTSB blamed the accident on the pilot-in-command's incorrectlyassuming the Jetstream's engine had failed. (The No. 1 engine ignitionlight illuminated, but the Board found no evidence of engine failure.)Further, the Board noted the pilot's subsequent failure to follow approvedprocedures for engine failure, go-around, and stall recovery.   Also cited ``was the failure of AMR Eagle/Flagship management toidentify, document, monitor and remedy deficiencies in pilot performanceand training.''What does any of this have to do with creating a database of pilot-trainingrecords? Even though the pilot had been working for Flagship for fouryears, the NTSB raised the issue of the pilot's less-than-exemplary recordat Comair, his previous employer.   The Board said Flagship had not requested the pilot's records fromComair when he was hired, nor was it Comair's policy to release suchrecords even if they had been requested. The NTSB believes some of thepilot shortcomings might have been traceable back to his performance atComair.   Air Line Pilots Association President Randolph Babbitt was sharplycritical of the NTSB's proposals, observing that after four years atFlagship, any performance problems the pilot might have had when hiredshould ``have been a known quantity [before the accident occurred] if thequalification program were effective.''   The ALPA president noted that training records and programs are notuniform from carrier to carrier. Pilots also do not have the opportunity``to comment on or rebut a particular notation,'' many of which are verysubjective, Babbitt said.   The FAA said it recognizes the importance of pilot-training records, butadded, ``There are privacy issues that must be addressed. The FAA isprepared to work with Congress, the NTSB and the aviation industry toresolve these issues.''

Thisyear's event is being held at Singapore's Changi Airport on February 6-11.   While other shows in the region focus on their local niches, AsianAerospace `96 is the big umbrella for the Asia/Pacific region as a whole.And it's where the CEOs turn up en masse.   Like other shows of its kind held recently, the Singapore air show isshaping up to be bigger and better than ever. Participating companies areup from 935 to 950, and from 34 countries as opposed to 31 two years ago.Corporate chalets-so important for hobnobbing with customers and signingdeals-are up to 126 from 116. (To judge the growth of the show, comparethat with a mere 30 chalets as recently as 1988).   The number of aircraft on display, however, will remain at around 70,because of the immutable restrictions on outdoor space imposed by theChangi Airport authorities. What will be interesting, though, will be theproportion of business aircraft in the static park.   Among them is bound to be a Singapore Airlines Learjet 31, one of sixoperated by the airline for pilot training. The airline recently placed arepeat order, and is slated to take four new Learjet 45s in the fourthquarter of 1997, with options on another two. Learjet recently delivered aModel 60 to Malaysia for airways inspection and calibration, and will havea representative aircraft on show.   The Citation X is slated to make its first Singapore appearance, as isBombardier's Global Express mockup. Gulfstream is unlikely to take the G-Vtest aircraft that far that soon, settling instead for a G-IVSP on display.Raytheon will be present with a Hawker 800 and Beechjet 400A, and Canadairwith a Challenger. Fairchild is making a first-time appearance as it sensessome demand for its 19- to 20-passenger Metroliner in the region, and Saabwill be playing up its larger 50-passenger Saab 2000. In that category, theCanadair Regional Jet also will be on exhibit.   Jet Aviation International, a corporate aircraft charter and managementcompany, is exhibiting for the first time, in support of its new Singaporeoperations. Indeed, many of the developments in business aviation arehappening outside the show. Among them: Zimex recently opened abusiness-aircraft maintenance/charter operation; Gulfstream has set up aregional parts depot with $1.5 million worth of spares; and AlliedSignaland Aviall have set up or beefed up their support for corporate-aviationcustomers in the region.   Back at the show, an undisputed highlight will be Bell Helicopter'spublic unveiling of both the new Model 407 light single helicopter andModel 430 intermediate twin helicopter, both of which will have justreceived U.S. certification.Photograph(s):Photograph: From under the wing of a Gulfstream IV, a view of the staticdisplay area at Singapore's Asian Aerospace `96.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   SUN-DEVIL-AREA FBOS MAKE SUPER BOWL PLANSBy:L.M./G.A.G.   Several Phoenix-area FBOs are making some special arrangements towelcome pilots headed west with their passengers to the Super Bowl, onJanuary 28, at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona.   At Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, all of the FBOs will beextending some extra hospitality. The FBO managers with whom we spoke saidthey have blocked hotel rooms, but urge all comers to claim them fast.Hotel rooms are scarce-not only due to the Super Bowl, but because of thePhoenix Open Golf Tournament taking place simultaneously. Travelers who arelate with their hotel bookings may have to shuttle to the game fromlodgings in Las Vegas or Tucson.   Angelo Tedeschi, Cutter Aviation's general manager, says his facilitywill have buffet-style refreshments, a large-screen television andhelicopter shuttles to and from the game. Super Bowl paraphernalia will befor sale in the lobby. He's had rooms blocked for two years. GTA AviationServices and Sawyer Aviation also will offer food and big-screen TVs. Inaddition, GTA will be auctioning off a Super Bowl ticket. At the city-runLincoln J. Ragsdale Executive Terminal, a 40-foot-by-60-foot hospitalitytent will be set up on the apron area just east of the terminal. The tentwill be equipped with a large-screen TV, tables, chairs (and heaters, ifnecessary). Ballpark-theme food and beverages will be served.   At Phoenix-Deer Valley Municipal Airport, General Manager Ron Haarersays his facility is making rooms available. ``We have a flight academy andwill use some of the apartments,'' he explained. A big-screen TV will beset up. Jet A will be selling for $1.67 per gallon using a credit card;100LL for $1.73 using a credit card.   The one FBO at Williams Gateway Airport-DynAir Fueling-is decking outits lounge area with refreshments, a large-screen TV, a pool table andmovies on videocassette for those who don't want to watch the game. Therewill be helicopter shuttles to and from the game site, and discount fuelrates for the duration.   At Scottsdale Airport, two FBOs are making a special hospitality effort.Desert Aviation (formerly Aero Services) is assisting with roomaccommodations and transportation. A big-screen TV and refreshments will beawaiting the arrivals. Les Horrell, president, said that staff will helppilots plot what to ``see and do'' while in the area. Russ Allen, directorof aviation services for Corporate Jets, says a reception cosponsored byLearjet and AlliedSignal will greet the facility's guests. ``One hangarwill be decorated in a Super Bowl motif, and we will have catered food anda large-screen TV,'' he noted. Also available will be 60 crew cars and afew remaining blocked hotel rooms.   From January 24-29, special arrival and departure procedures will be inplace at the following airports: Sky Harbor, Scottsdale, Deer Valley,Falcon Field and Goodyear Municipal.   A slot time (with a 30-minute window) will be required for all generalaviation IFR arrivals and departures. Beginning at 0600 hours to midnighton January 22, pilots can call the Albuquerque traffic-management unit(TMU) to request an arrival slot time and reservation number. Calls for adeparture slot can be made starting January 26. The toll-free number is(800) 879-4435.   Reservations can only be made 48 hours in advance of the estimated timeof arrival or departure. Pilots should be ready to provide the TMU withdeparture and destination identifiers, and proposed UTC arrival/departuretime. The TMU will provide a time and reservation code that must beincluded in the remarks section of the flight plan. Pilots must arrive nomore than five minutes before and no later than 10 minutes after their slottime and depart in the block time allocated. Users not complying with thesetimes could face extensive delays.   Except for emergencies, air-filed IFR flight plans, changes indestination or aircraft without coded slot approvals will not be acceptedby ATC to land at the five program airports.   The FAA warns that VFR aircraft desiring to land at Sky Harbor mayexperience delays of more than 30 minutes. Pilots in VFR aircraft shouldcontact Phoenix Approach no later than 20 nm from Sky Harbor for delay andClass B airspace clearance information.   Overflight traffic not landing in the Phoenix areas should avoidtransiting within a 30-nm radius of Sky Harbor at and below 10,000 feetmsl.

The NTSB has put out a wake-up call for managers and their line pilotsto start paying attention to the safety implications of crew fatigue.   To spread the alarm, the Safety Board sponsored an internationalconference in November 1995 to help determine the extent to which fatiguecontributes to transportation accidents, and to reveal some of thecountermeasures that can be used to avoid fatigue-related accidents. Theconference attracted more than 500 attendees from around the world.   One NTSB member confided that although formal aviation-accidentinvestigations might not be able to identify fatigue as a frequentcontributing factor, he was convinced that about half of allgeneral-aviation accidents are fatigue related.   David Dinges, M.D., from the University of Pennsylvania Medical Schoolin Philadelphia, discussed the vast amount of research that had been doneto uncover the characteristics of hazardous fatigue. Mark R. Rosekind, ofthe NASA Fatigue Countermeasures Program in Moffett Field, California,discussed a variety of steps that can be taken to avoid the oftendevastating results of severe fatigue.   The eye-opening message of the presentations was that an enormousreservoir of information establishes irrefutably that no one is immune tofatigue. Guest speakers made it clear that the effects of fatigue could beheightened by a number of contributory conditions, including the lack ofproper nutrition and the impact of emotional disturbances. Rosekind and Dr.Dinges also emphasized that while judicious use of caffeine might providesome short-term beneficial effect in overcoming fatigue, the body soondevelops resistance to its awakening jolt.   According to researchers, testing in recent years clearly has documentedthe deleterious effects of fatigue on performing complicated tasks as wellas on judgment.   Presenters conveyed examples of transportation accidents in which flawedjudgment resulting from fatigue was found to be causal. Examples cited werethe Exxon Valdez grounding and an aircraft accident at Guantanamo Bay, Cubain 1993 in which the crew had been on duty for 18 hours and had flown forapproximately nine hours.   Rosekind's research into fatigue countermeasures shows that a number oftechniques can be used to reduce or stave off the most serious fatigueepisodes. Brief supervised naps, although not presently authorized in mostaircraft operations, often refresh long-duty crewmembers. Bright lights andanimated conversations in the cockpit, too, sometimes help (but thatsuggestion can butt up against the sterile cockpit theory).   Researchers agree that in aviation, pilots and managers must be wellinformed in order to understand the complexity of forcing the body clock towork in accordance with the demands of modern business. Ultimately, thephysical toll will demand the modification of rules that allow unrealisticexpectations to be made of individuals.   At present, few pilots receive any training or information on how toavoid fatigue.What's more, many career aviators still believe they areimmune to its hazardous effects.   In coming months, the FAA may revise rules and recommendations regardingduty and flight times for pilots. Meanwhile, managers and line pilots canstudy and consider the scientific information on fatigue.

Concern over replacement parts has long been a part of aviation,particularly when the source of those parts has been other than theOEM-such as independent parts distributors, repair stations or PartsManufacturer Approval (PMA) companies.   Indeed, concern particularly over bogus replacement parts issues in theairline industry (not any actual increase in the number of incidents)reached a crescendo when the FAA disclosed plans to tighten up rules andprocedures for the manufacturing, distributing and disposal of replacementparts.   Few incidents of alleged wrongdoing by independent parts distributorsand repair stations have been reported. And, the vast majority of PMAcompanies dealing with general-aviation parts are not only legitimate, butalso can offer some significant advantages over OEM-provided parts.   Dallas-based Superior Turbine is an example of a PMA company at itsbest. Superior Turbine was founded in 1992 to manufacture parts for theAllison 250 series engines. The company is a division of Superior AirParts, established in 1967 and now one of the largest suppliers of partsfor Continental and Lycoming piston engines. In 1995, Superior Turbinestarted operating out of a new Dallas-based facility.   Good PMA companies claim they offer these four primary advantages overOEMs: lower prices, speedier delivery, expanded warranties and betterquality. For instance, Superior says it sells Allison parts at 25 percentbelow Allison Engine's list prices. Of course, once after-market partssuppliers begin competing with OEMs, most original manufacturers drop theirprices to meet the competition. In addition, many PMA firms, like Superior,ship parts much faster than the typical OEM. OEMs' shipments can take up to90 days because replacement parts are only a small portion of many OEMbusinesses.   As competitors with OEMs, Superior and other PMA firms strive to provideparts of higher quality than the original ones they are replacing. Forexample, Superior entered the turbine-engine-parts business with its ST-250package, consisting of Superior-developed and certificated hot-section andoverhaul replacement parts for Allison 250s.   Because Superior feels its parts are of a higher quality than originals,the company covers its products with a materials and workmanship warrantythat is often longer than the OEM's: two years or 1,000 hours of engineoperation. A prorated warranty is in effect in the third year.   However, even the best of PMA firms are not infallible. When mostsuppliers were out of a certain Lycoming engine rod bolt, Superior found adealer that had some surplus bolts. Since they were presented as genuineLycoming bolts, and since an inspection of the first batch revealed theywere acceptable, Superior ordered 3,000 bolts and began to sell them toengine shops.   Superior later discovered that some bolts in the last batch didn't meetspec, and the company immediately drafted a service bulletin and urged theFAA to issue an AD. In addition, the company used its parts-tracking systemto identify and contact all customers who bought the suspect bolts.   One engine failure was traced to the bolts, and although Superior didn'tmanufacture the defective bolts, it offered to pay for labor, new bolts andother related parts.   Operators will find that the best of the PMA firms provide that kind ofcustomer support, in addition to being a provider of high-quality parts.Photograph(s):Photograph: Superior Turbine CAD/CAM operator Dennis Miller adjusts partsdimensions on design and manufacturing drawings to meet PMA requirements.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   SPLITTING AIRSBy:P.E.B.   A recent NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System report provides a goodreminder (as though you'd forgotten) that the FAA sometimes splits hairswhen defining operating procedures.   A VFR pilot called approach control prior to entering Class B airspace.The controller responded with the aircraft's call sign, transponder codeand a request for an ident, with which the pilot complied.   The airman continued his flight and penetrated the Class B boundary.About a minute later, the controller said, ``I guess a clearance meansnothing, but you are cleared into the Class B airspace,'' the pilot relatedin his ASRS account.   The pilot had assumed-wrongly-that giving him a code implied clearance.Not so, says the FAA, which says look at the FARs and the AeronauticalInformation Manual. FAR Part 91.131 and the AIM stipulate that a pilot mustbe specifically cleared to enter Class B airspace.   However, had the pilot been approaching Class C or Class D airspace, hewould have been perfectly legal. The standard in those instances requiressimply establishing two-way radio communication. In other words, as long asa controller answers a call using the aircraft call sign (even to ask apilot to stand by), then two-way communication has been established, andthe pilot is free to enter Class C or D airspace-unless specifically askedto remain clear.   Another split hair: If the controller responds to a call, but does notuse your call sign, two-way communica-tion has not been established,according to the AIM and ATC controllers' handbook. For instance, if yourcall is answered with, ``Aircraft calling,stand by,'' you have to stay clear of Class C and D airspace as well asClass B.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   BOOK REVIEW: AVIATION MANAGEMENT, CASTRO STYLEBy:P.E.B.   In his preface to Corporate Aviation Management, author Raoul Castrosets an ambitious goal: to write a ``practical guide for the executive incharge of the aviation department, the aviation department manager or chiefpilot, aspirants to aviation management positions, and teachers andstudents of aviation management.''   What results is a 349-page text that is a soup-to-nuts guide forcorporate aviation management. Because it sets out to do so much, the textis best used as an overview, and is likely to appeal more to those peoplestudying business aviation or interested in rising through the ranks incorporate flight departments than to current managers.   The book is organized into four parts: an overview of corporate aviationand basic management principles, a discussion of flight-departmenteconomics, a section Castro calls the ``Seven Key Factors,'' and a briefsection that attempts to predict the future of corporate aviation.   The crux of the book is delivered in the second and third sections.Within the economics section is a chapter on how to assess the costs andbenefits of aircraft operations. Castro delves deeply into justificationissues, providing useful real-world examples of how to compare the use ofbusiness jets to other modes of transportation, and how to translate thetime business jets save into money that can offset the cost of aircraftoperation.   Section three breaks down corporate aviation into three departments andfour operational objectives, which combine to form Castro's ``Seven KeyFactors.'' The departments are: flight, maintenance, and schedule andpassenger service. The operational objectives are: safety, security,emergency planning and training. It is this section that touches-sometimestoo briefly-on virtually every facet of corporate-aircraft operations.   The author's writing style is sometimes choppy, but at the same time,the book is easy to understand and a quick read. Castro, who currentlyworks as an aviation consultant, has held (since 1947) positions toonumerous to mention in corporate aviation, including 17 years as manager ofMarcor's multi-aircraft flight department.   Corporate Aviation Management is published by the Southern IllinoisUniversity Press and is available for $34.95, plus $3 postage and handling.To order, call SIU at (800) 346-2680.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   CRM-THE AMPLIFIED FORMBy:L.M.   A Stow, Massachusetts-based company-Cockpit Management Resources(CMR)-takes crew resource management (CRM) a step beyond the one-seminarapproach. The company, established in 1979, contracts with corporations togive individualized, year-long training-correspondence-course style-topilots.   ``We don't believe you can change behavior in a short workshop,'' saidBob Mudge, who is a co-president and founder of CMR, along with his son,Gordon.   The elder Mudge is a former pilot with Delta Airlines, and previouslyNortheastern Airlines, while his son is a general aviation pilot. Accordingto Bob Mudge, the company's interaction with each pilot amounts toapproximately 18 to 24 hours per year. ``Our approach to CRM differs fromtraditional CRM in that it is objective, not subjective.'' And it isprivate, between each pilot and CMR.   Pilots enrolled in the program receive one study unit per month for 12months. The units include written material for the student to study, plusaudiotapes of pilot, copilot and check pilot scenarios. Once students feelthey have mastered the material, they must complete essay questions ormultiple-choice questions and mail the answers back to CMR for feedback andcritique.   The company has coined its approach to CRM as the Quantum-Pro ManagementSystem. To CMR, Cockpit Resource Management is a systematic, ``not justpsychological or operational training method.'' CMR emphasizes thedebriefing-tracing errors back to their cause ``so crewmembers can avoidthem in future flights,'' said Mudge. ``What we're after is significant,measurable improvement in flightcrew performance that lasts over time.''   Kevin Lynch, a pilot for a Fortune 50 company on the West Coast andprogram coordinator in his flight department for Quantum-Pro said, ``Whathelped us most is the debrief, going over the strengths and weaknesses of aflight. The program also defined a common set of tools that everyone in theflight department can use to make communication happen.'' Lynch said theCMR program introduces standard management procedures that the pilots canimplement without question, just like standard operating procedures.   Mudge says the goal of CMR's Quantum-Pro system is a quality-controlledflight department that performs with increased safety, fewer regulatoryviolations, improved customer service, lower training expenses, highermorale and fewer internal administrative/personnel problems.   CMR offers two versions of the course. The fee for the all-up version,requiring responses to essay questions, is $3,395 per pilot. Anotherversion that involves less individualized interaction with CRM, andresponses to multiple-choice questions, costs $2,495. If a corporationwants to kick off the program with a two-day workshop on site, there's anextra charge of roughly $3,000. Other workshop arrangements arenegotiable.

Ever worry about what happens to the EKG that is transmitted to the FAAduring your flight physical? Many do-unnecessarily. The process has been inuse for years, and few bugs invade the system.   The data from an AME's EKG machine are faxed to the FAA's EKG center inOklahoma City. There, a computer reads the data received. If the computerreads something that is out of normal range, an FAA doctor reviews thetracing. Then, if it is considered ``clinically significant'' (a true heartproblem), your AME may get a call. If it is only suspicious, the agencywill probably write you requesting that you have the EKG repeated. In thelatter case, the AME already has signed you off, so you won't be grounded.But the FAA expects you to comply with its request for another test.   But, what about those bugs that can affect any electronic transmission?Contrary to popular belief, those electronic glitches are easily detectedbecause they don't come close to the signal put out by your heart. If afaulty transmission occurs, there is often an immediate alarm in OklahomaCity, and the FAA will attempt to call the AME before you leave the office.At worst, you might have to return to the AME for a retest, but a pilot isnever grounded as a result of a transmission anomaly.   What's more, before the agency required EKGs to be transmitted, therewere more errors and queries generated from handwritten copies beingmailed.   Incidentally, it's smart to ask your AME to read your EKG before it'stransmitted to the FAA. The leads hooking you to the EKG machine can bereversed or loose, or the doctor may need to explain a variation. Ofcourse, it's far more expedient if the FAA initially gets an accuratetracing along with a clinically acceptable explanation for a variation.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   A TUG HERE, A PUSH THEREBy:G.A.G.   Once more, communication and cooperation win without the power of sizeor weight. We are referring to the success of smaller, regionally orientedaviation groups to obtain significant changes in the way the federalgovernment does business.   A few months ago, it was the New York State Aviation Association asvictor (B/CA, November 1995, page 42). This time, it is the culmination ofmore than three years of effort by the Teterboro Users and OperatorsAssociation-known locally as TUG (Teterboro Users Group).   One of the tangible effects of TUG's constant dialogue with Northeastarea ATC officials has been a marked reduction in traffic delays at NewJersey's Teterboro Airport. (See accompanying chart.)   These reductions in delays come, in part, directly from the followingTUG-encouraged enhancements: the creation of a secondary departureposition, a VOR/DME approach for Runway 24, charted visual approaches forRunways 1 and 6, lower minimums for the ILS to Runway 6, and the DaltonDeparture Procedure. The FAA is also working on developing an LDA approachfor Runway 19.   TUG turned its attention to Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM)criteria at a meeting with ATC officials in December 1995. The FAA providedinformation on the cost and the process for obtaining RVSM approval.

England-based Captain Zvi Doron, the person who brought you theHummingbird software for evaluating and comparing helicopter performance(B/CA, September 1995, page 58), recently introduced similar software forlight and medium airplanes. Called Sparrowhawk, the PC-compatible programallows comparison of performance capabilities for up to three aircraftsimultaneously. Parameters of aircraft from two-seat pistons to twin-engineturboprops are included in the database.   The program contains a list of default values to ensure an unbiasedcomparison, says Doron. The defaults include number of crewmembers, crewweight, average passenger weight and fuel reserves in terms of flying time.The user can redefine these defaults according to the operatingconditions.   Specific mission profiles can be tested by defining range or payloadrequirements. An editing menu allows the user to explore numerouscombinations of existing, modified or new aircraft.   In addition to having a PC with MS-DOS 3.0 or higher, users need atleast 640 KB of memory and a color or monochrome VGA monitor with astandard resolution of 640 x 480.   Software price is $175.

Searles   For most business-aircraft operators, the FAA is the local inspector whodutifully, and usually cordially, conducts certification check rides andmaintenance inspections. But no matter how amicable your local FlightStandards District Office (FSDO) representative is, there are times whenyou wonder if the agency isn't just a Washington-based bureaucracy whoseprimary objective is to make life difficult for those who fly.   In an era in which it has become fashionable to criticize all governmentagencies (especially regulatory bodies), it's tempting to think of the FAAas a phalanx of curmudgeons bent on hassling operators. But despite currentstereotypes of aviation-agency personnel, there are 1,500 full-timeemployees at the FAA's Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey whoare working quietly and conscientiously to develop new technologies andprocedures that will make flying safer, easier and more efficient.   The FAA Technical Center, which recently celebrated its 15thanniversary, is a national scientific test base for the agency's research,development and acquisition programs. Located on the 5,000-acre, FAA-ownedAtlantic City International Airport, the Tech Center tests and evaluatessystems and procedures of ATC, airborne communications and navigation,airports, aircraft safety and airline security.   In addition, the Tech Center is responsible for long-range developmentof innovative systems and concepts, as well as new aviation hardware andsoftware. The facility also modifies existing equipment and procedures. Atany given time, 150 projects are under way at the center.   One of the reasons that much of the FAA's research and development isconducted at the FAA Technical Center is because Atlantic City is subjectto a wide range of weather conditions. The site also is close to theNortheast's high-density air-traffic corridor, yet has open airspace overthe nearby Atlantic Ocean.   The Tech Center site, located 10 miles northwest of Atlantic City, wasoriginally developed during World War II as a naval air station. When theaviation infrastructure was struggling to keep pace with the rapidlyexpanding postwar use of civil aircraft, the Airways Modernization Boardtook over the facility on July 1, 1958 and renamed it the National AviationFacilities Experimental Center (NAFEC).   NAFEC inherited three dozen wooden buildings that were erected in theearly 1940s, which made it difficult to perform some of the experimentsthat required strictly controlled test environments. Although the FAA movedits fleet of specially instrumented aircraft into a new, modern hangar atAtlantic City in 1968, for many years NAFEC was unable to get enough moneyto modernize the other facilities there.   By the early 1970s, the expense and inconvenience of continuing to workin dilapidated buildings made the agency seriously consider moving its testand evaluation functions to Oklahoma City. The poor working conditions atAtlantic City, coupled with recurring rumors of the center's imminentdemise, took a toll on the morale of NAFEC personnel.   However, the threat of an impending shutdown coalesced support amongNAFEC proponents. Local citizens-led by the first NAFEC director, acongressman and a one-time Atlantic City mayor-formed a partnership withother government officials to obtain the backing necessary to modernizeNAFEC's physical plant. Their efforts resulted in a new, $50-million,four-story, 516,000-square-foot building. On May 29, 1980, Vice PresidentWalter Mondale and FAA Administrator Langhorne Bond presided over thededication of the new FAA Technical Center, the name by which not only thebuilding but also the entire complex has since been known.   The Tech Center is unique because of its ability to conduct totalsystems testing and integration. At least one example of every electronicsystem installed in the ATC system-from those troublesome 1960s vintagecomputers to the latest digital devices-can be found at Atlantic City. Asone Tech Center official said, ``We're the first FAA facility to get thenew equipment and the last to get rid of the old equipment.''   By having access to all types of ATC equipment and utilizing the TechCenter's immense simulation capability, project engineers can experimentwith modifications to existing equipment or procedures without having totake a single runway or navaid out of service.   In addition to relying on simulation of new equipment and techniques,the Tech Center uses a variety of specially equipped aircraft to test-flynew hardware and procedures, collect data and flight-check experimentalground-based surveillance systems, navaids and other guidance systems. Thecurrent fleet of ``flying laboratories'' consists of two Convair 580s and aSikorsky S-76 (all with glass cockpits), a Boeing 727-100, a Beech King Airand a twin-piston Aero Commander.   The Tech Center's aircraft operate primarily from Atlantic CityInternational Airport, which has two runways, including one that is 10,000feet long. However, what makes the airfield distinctive are itsexperimental approach and guidance systems. Atlantic City is the site ofthe National Concepts Development and Demonstration Heliport and isequipped with MLS, AWOS, PAPI and a system of reconfigurable landinglights.   The Tech Center also has one of the finest aircraft test ranges in theworld, and over the years, the facility's navigation branch has developedan ex-ceptional data collection, reduction and analysis capability. As TomGrygotis, manager of the Tech Center's flight-test branch, said, ``You cantest things here you can't test anywhere else in the world.''   But it takes qualified people as well as sophisticated equipment to makea technical center. Atlantic City was able to make the transition from atest and evaluation facility to one that is more involved in conceptualwork by injecting a lot of young, high-technology blood into theorganization, remembers former acting FAA Administrator Joseph Del Balzo.He started at the Tech Center as a project engineer in 1960 and served asdirector of the facility for five years beginning in 1976.   ``We had a lot of joint programs with universities,'' recalled DelBalzo, who now heads a consulting firm in Washington, D.C. ``Embry-Riddleconducted advanced degree courses on [the Tech Center] campus, and we had adoctorate program in human factors in conjunction with Columbia University.At that time, we ran the government's largest co-op program, especiallywith minority institutions, which accounts for the diversity at the TechCenter today.''   By attracting technically qualified people to Atlantic City, the TechCenter was able to convince headquarters that it could assume completeprogram responsibility for research into such areas as aircraft safety andairport technology. This, in turn, led to a resident world-class technicalcapability in a host of disciplines, from ATC simulation and aircraftcrashworthiness to fire testing and human factors.   For example, the ATC simulation facility can replicate, in real time,virtually any airport and traffic situation in the world on its radardisplays, thanks to its ability to ``fly'' up to 400 computer-generatedaircraft. The air traffic labs can be configured to represent an en route,terminal or automated FSS facility, and a tower cab mockup is used to planthe layout of positions and equipment for use in control towers.   The Tech Center's Human Factors Lab uses advanced techniques, such asvirtual reality, to study the man-machine interface. Future airport designscan be reviewed by flying approaches to computer-generated runways. Thislab also utilizes a reconfigurable cockpit simulator in which videodisplays are altered to test various instrument panel layouts andpresentations.   Also housed at the FAA Technical Center is the world's largestfull-scale, aviation fire-test facility. Experiments conducted there pavedthe way for the development of fire-blocking seat materials, emergencyfloor lighting, heat-resistant emergency slides and today's stringentstandards for cabins and cargo compartment materials.   The Tech Center's aircraft crashworthiness facilities include a 50-footdrop tower, a catapult and a track for rapid deceleration or impact tests.A number of general-aviation aircraft-including a Beech 1900, one of tworemaining Learfans and a dozen Piper fuselages given to the FAA after thecompany's Lock Haven factory was flooded in 1972-are being used at thisfacility.   Other test facilities located at the Tech Center range from wind tunnelsand chemistry labs to engine test cells and an environmental chamber thatcan simulate heat, humidity, altitude and rainfall.   What has all this research meant for business aviation? Besidesdeveloping numerous improvements for the airspace system in general, theTech Center extensively flight-tested GPS in conjunction with industry,which led to IFR certification of the system and creation of non-precisionGPS approaches. Atlantic City also developed general aviationoccupant-restraint systems and energy- absorbing seats. In addition, thefacility proved the feasibility of simple, inexpensive design changes thatenhanced the load-carrying capability of light airplanes.   GA-related projects that the Tech Center is working on today include:production of a viable no-lead avgas, refinement of TCAS I and developmentof sensors that would give pilots a visual indication of icing.   Despite the FAA Technical Center's immense capabilities, not everyproject undertaken is successful. For example, the FAA's anti-mistingkerosene program, an effort to chemically alter turbine fuel to minimizepost-crash fires, didn't pan out. And some electronic systems, such as theBeacon Collision Avoidance System (BCAS) and the Discrete Address BeaconSystem (DABS), never made it into the field.   But as former Tech Center director Del Balzo is quick to point out,accomplishments shouldn't always be measured in terms of new systems.``It's not so much the products and the technologies [produced by the TechCenter], it's the development of people and a capability that will serve usinto the 21st century.''Photograph(s):Photograph: The Human Factors Laboratory, one of the newer facilities atthe FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, uses sophisticatedequipment to measure how pilots and controllers visually react to differenttypes of displays.Photograph: Air traffic laboratories at the FAA Technical Center test newautomated ATC equipment and computer programs.

Aarons   Flight Safety Foundation (FSF), the nonprofit, member-supportedinternational organization dedicated to improving flight safety, isdistributing a 33-minute videotape designed to help flightcrew membersavoid controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) accidents. I urge you to beg,borrow, steal or even buy a copy. This video, prepared by Jeppesen, is mustviewing for all pilots. The FSF will sell you a copy for $30 if you can'tfind one elsewhere, but someone on your airport should have one soon; some5,000 copies are being distributed at no cost to NBAA and FSF members.   The video, funded by 28 commercial and organizational sponsors, is aimedat flightcrews of busness turbine aircraft and regional transports.However, its content is important for all IFR pilots. Basically, the tapediscusses the insidious nature of CFIT accidents-those in which flightcrewswere unaware of impending collisions with terrain-and it examines in detailthree such incidents.   One accident, which involved a VOR approach in the Far East, includesthe final minutes of the U.S. corporate jet's cockpit voice recorder. Itenables us to listen in as misunderstanding grows between the controllerand the flightcrew until disaster becomes inevitable. It's a chillingexperience, but it carries with it an unforgettable lesson.   Another CFIT example profiles a commuter accident that occurred during anight approach over unlighted terrain in Canada. Computer animation enablesus to experience the black-hole effect that ultimately drew the crew intothe trees. The third accident involved a U.S. corporate jet that crashedinto a mountain shortly after takeoff. The crew was attempting to maintainVFR while circling in hilly terrain trying to pick up an IFR flight plan.   Stuart Matthews, FSF president, chairman and CEO, says this video ``is astrong accident prevention tool,'' and we agree entirely with thatassessment. Says Matthews, ``The risk of being involved in a CFIT accidentis linked to a number of factors, including equipment, flightcrew trainingand type of operation. Although the majority of CFIT fatalities occur onlarge commercial aircraft, the largest number of CFIT accidents involvesmaller turboprop and jet aircraft. But no matter what type of aircraft youfly, your CFIT risk increases dramatically during the approach phase.   While you're tracking down a copy of the video, be sure to get a copy ofthe FSF's CFIT checklist, a risk assessment tool that enables you toevaluate the threat of CFIT in any specific operation. The videotapeproject, along with the checklist and a simulator scenario (currently underdevelopment by Boeing), are part of the FSF's five-year program to reduceCFIT accidents by half.   This excellent project is another reason why B/CA is a member of theFSF, and why we urge all flight operations to support it through membershipactivity or sponsorships.

The last dividend-three cents pershare-was paid in the June 1995 quarter.   Bryan Bedford, the carrier's new president and CEO, said that theMinneapolis-based regional continues to have a strong balance sheet andthat earnings remain in line with analysts' expectations. The company hasbeen conducting extensive evaluations of new aircraft, planning anear-complete replacement of its existing fleet that includes 26 FairchildMetros and 25 de Havilland Dash 8-100s (B/CA, December 1995, page C2).   ``The company is analyzing various fleet replacement options now andexpects to make a decision on the new fleet by the [1995],'' a statementsaid. The carrier is believed to have selected the Beech 1900 to replacethe Metros, but also has been considering the 29-passenger Jetstream 41.Heading the short list for a 30-passenger-class aircraft were the Dornier328, Saab 340BPlus and the incumbent Dash 8-probably the 200 series.Mesaba's existing Dash 8s begin coming off their short-term leases thisyear.   Mesaba operates as a Northwest Airlink carrier from the senior partner'sDetroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul hubs.

No, not hamburgers-people.'' That is theway the AMR Eagle press release announced the carrier's 75 millionthpassenger in 11 years of operation. The actual number was 75.25 million,which roughly equals one-third of the U.S. population.   ``Becoming the first regional airline to transport more than 75-millionpassengers is an incredible achievement and points to our growing niche inthe air transportation industry,'' said Eagle President Dan Garton. Elevenyears ago, the carrier operated just 60 daily flights to seven cities.Today the number is more than 1,600 daily departures to more than 150destinations in the United States, Canada, the Bahamas and the Caribbean,making it the largest regional airline in the world.   In an unrelated development, Eagle has named Lance McDonald to the newlycreated position of vice president of flight operations. McDonald hasserved the past seven years as vice president of flight operations forEagle unit Simmons Airlines.   In his new job, McDonald will direct the development of standardized,cost-effective flight operations and procedures among the four Eaglecarriers-Executive, Flagship, Wings West and Simmons. He also will overseerevision and distribution of fleet-specific operations manuals, coordinateoperational and regulatory issues with the FAA, direct operations ofEagle's Emergency Management Center, and supervise the carrier's SystemOperations control, which includes crew scheduling and dispatch.   One more newly created position still to be filled at B/CA presstime-that of vice president of maintenance and engineering-effectivelydivides the responsibilities of Vice President of Operations Robert Zoller,who is retiring after four years in the post. It was Zoller who superviseda number of key operational changes at Eagle.   They included the centralization and automation of Systems OperationsControl; creation of the Eagle Flight Training Center; design andimplementation of automated dispatch, flight planning and fuel planningsystems; and development of standardized maintenance inspection programsfor the Eagle fleet.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   COMAIR TAKES ANOTHER 10 CRJS   Delta Connection Comair has reaffirmed its affection for the CanadairRegional Jet by exercising its options for 10 additional aircraft.

The manufacturer said itwould build on the F70 certification at LCY, but certification of thelarger F100 will depend on market demand.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   ACA SECURES NEW FINANCING   United Express carrier Atlantic Coast Airlines has secured a $20-millionline of credit with Shawmut Capital Corporation of Boston. TheWashington-Dulles-based carrier will use the funds to finance itsoutstanding receivables, the company said.   The three-year arrangement replaces the airline's existing credit line.It will reduce ACA's annual interest expense and other related costs whileimproving the terms of the carrier's receivable financing, it added.   ``The financing agreement we reached with ACA is a classic example offorging a beneficial relationship for both organizations,'' said ShawmutExecutive Vice President Ferrell Coppedge. ``For ACA, the lower financingrates and better terms will allow them to build on the momentum of theirfinancial turnaround. For Shawmut, we are excited to have aligned ourselveswith a young and dynamic company that is clearly on the rise in theirindustry,'' he added.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   INDUSTRY FALLS UNDER A MICROSCOPE TO CONQUER SAFETY CHALLENGESBy:James Ott   The internal workings of commercial aviation-from flight operations toaircraft maintenance and beyond-will fall increasingly under a microscopeas industry shoulders the safety challenges of the future.   This message rang out clearly in several key presentations offered byFAA and industry representatives at The McGraw-Hill Companies' AviationWeek Group Chicago `95 Conference and Exhibit November 1 to 3. More than150 participants and industry leaders from around the world discussed thechallenges ahead.   Improving the margin of safety in U.S. aviation has become a primaryobjective of government, industry and labor. Reducing the accident ratewill become increasingly urgent in view of the 40-percent increase indirect flights expected over the next 10 to 15 years, FAA AdministratorDavid Hinson said.   ``If we only manage to maintain today's low accident rate, the estimatedgrowth in aviation will increase the number of jet crashes worldwide toabout one a week,'' Hinson said, quoting the results of a Boeing Companystudy.   The FAA is in the process of implementing 173 detailed safetyinitiatives that emerged from 1994's agency-sponsored Aviation SafetyConference. The conference was prompted by a rare spate of accidentsincluding several involving regional carriers. Hinson singled out as aforemost achievement of that conference the industry agreement that allowsthe FAA access to data from airline flight operations.   ``I hope this agreement will lay the groundwork for a much morecomprehensive international data exchange, which will make safety datainstantly available, onine, to aviation professionals everywhere in theworld,'' Hinson said.   U.S. carriers are initiating programs of Flight Operations QualityAssurance (FOQA) as part of this safety drive. Under these programs,information from flight data recorders is being collected and analyzed. TheFAA and airlines are working out a method for the FAA to access theinformation.   Christopher Hart, assistant FAA administrator for system safety and apanelist discussing ``Safety: Danger Zones of the Future,'' said theanalysis of airline operational data will allow the FAA to become``proactive'' in safety. He predicts a cultural shift in the FAA toward theprevention of unsafe operations and away from its traditional role ofenforcer of regulations.   Hinson said the incident and accident data now compiled by the FAA are``all anecdotal'' and virtually useless. Hart said the new emphasis lay onanalysis of greater quantities of data. The airlines and the FAA are nowworking out ways to access the information.   The Flight Safety Foundation has long advocated that airline managementshould establish corporate safety departments and create a ``safetyculture'' within each carrier. It also has encouraged nonpunitiveapproaches to accident and incident investigations. FSF president and chiefexecutive officer Stuart Matthews, another panelist, said that qualityassurance programs will act as an accident intervention strategy.   ``The trends and subtle errors identified by this method, properly fedback into briefings, training programs andmanagement policies, complementthe maintenance trend-analysis programs and can substantially reduce theopportunities for error,'' he told the conference.   Ove Dahlen, chairman of Saab Aircraft of America, noted that operationsdata analysis has been conducted routinely and successfully by military airforces. He also raised the point that, because of two accidents, theregional/commuter industry was unfairly billed as unsafe and a motivatingcause of the Aviation Safety Conference. The record amply shows quite thereverse: that commuter flying is safe, he said.   The Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) program underway at DeltaAir Lines was described as a prime example of what is happening inindustry. Delta has consolidated safety operations into one office underJohn Lauber, vice president of corporate safety and compliance.   Lauber studied human factors as causes of accidents while at NASA andlater applied the concept in his crash investigative work as a two-termmember of the NTSB. Under Lauber, Delta has founded a Safety Council andextended the reach of that council to a companion group that serves theDelta Connection Carriers.   Delta's safety program applies across the board and has been expanded toinclude air and ground operations. Techniques used in crew resourcemanagement (CRM) in which human factors come into play are being applied toother kinds of work beyond the cockpit. Formal investigations of allaccidents and incidents are undertaken. The airline has adopted thenonpunitive approach recommended by the FSF to the investigations.   The human factors mission, Lauber told the group, was to:   -- Foster a barrier-free working climate that inspires trust, teamwork,quality and pride;   -- Give everyone a stake in the operation and its outcome; and   -- Push responsibility and authority down-foster accountability at alllevels.   John O'Brien, director of engineering and safety for the Air Line PilotsAssociation, said the FAA proposal to adopt Part 121 safety standards forcommuter/regional aircraft was a step in the right direction but stillfalls short of ALPA's One Level of Safety program.   ``But to clearly achieve One Level of Safety in this proposal, the FAAmust adopt a new attitude, one of taking valid ideas and using them becausethey are correct,'' O'Brien said.   He recommended the FAA: extend the Part 121 safety standards toscheduled air cargo carriers; outline specific duties for safety directors;reduce phase-in times for aircraft equipment modifications; provide bothpilots in the cockpit with airport and navigation charts; phase outoperations of certain small commuter aircraft models that do not meethigher standards; strengthen requirements for emergency evacuationdemonstrations and for smoke detectors and fire suppression; require use ofTCAS II collision avoidance devices rather than TCAS I; improve trainingrequirements; boost standards and equipment for small airports used bycommuters; phase-in application of the age 60 mandatory retirement rule forcommuter pilots; and continue with plans to strengthen flight time limitsfor all types of operators.   During the conference, Henri Wassenbergh, the aviation scholar andformer Netherlands negotiator, received the L. Welch Pogue award from theAviation Week Group in recognition of his contributions to advancing thecause of liberalization in international aviation.   In his tenure as a Netherlands negotiator, Wassenbergh espoused freetrade in aviation. He was one of the inventors of country-of-originpricing, which became a commonly accepted article of bilateral aviationagreements. He also conceived of the ``double disapproval'' provision foragreements. Under that provision, low fares are encouraged and remain ineffect until each of the participants in a two-party agreement act towithdraw them.   The Pogue award, created by the Aviation Week Group, is named for theWashington, D.C. resident who served U.S. aviation interests as anappointee of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Pogue was named chairman ofthe Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) prior to World War II, and was appointeda U.S. delegate to the 1944 international conference that authorized theChicago Convention, the legal framework for establishing rules of the airand aviation standards through the ICAO.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   BUSINESS AIRCRAFT SALES   (January 1995 - November 1995)Retail deliveries of turbine aircraft showed another uptick in November-alift that resulted from an 11.8 percent jump in worldwide sales of new jetsand turboprops in contrast to a 10.0 percent decline in resales.And although the total number of sales of new and previously owned turbinesdropped 7.6 percent from 1994's 11-month total, the picture continued tosteadily improve.   Preliminary data show U.S. sales of new aircraft rose 20.3 percentthrough November, according to Wichita-based AvData. Domestic deliveries ofprevioulsy owned turbines fell 7.4 percent behind last year's total.   Revised U.S. data through October showed new and used turbine sales up0.5 percent over last year including a 31.7 percent surge in new aircraftsales and only a 2.8 percent drop in the used market.   International sales during the first 11 months of 1995 dropped 29.2percent below 1994's total. Deliveries of all new turbines fell 6.8 percentwhile resales dropped by more than a third. Aggregate shortfallsnotwithstanding, preliminary reports through November showed sales of newturboprops had already surpassed last year's annual total.   Updated October figures revealed total sales outside the United Statesdeclined 25.4 percent overall. New aircraft deliveries fell 4.9 percentshort of 1994's 10-month tally while resales were down 29.5 percent.   AvData compilations encompass only sales to retail customers. Dealer andbroker transactions are not included. Monthly revisions reflect additionalinformation as it becomes available.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   DOMESTIC TURBOJET SALES   Ten new jets sold in the United States in November, down from 17 inNovember 1994. Cessna sold four Citation V Ultras and Raytheon AircraftCompany delivered two Hawker 800s. Single sales were listed for theCanadair 601-3R, Dassault Falcon 2000, Learjet 60 and Gulfstream IVSP.   There were 39 domestic resales in November 1995, down from 81 forNovember 1994. Learjet sold nine previously owned models and Cessna soldeight. Raytheon listed seven resales, including Beech and Hawker-Siddeleymodels, and Israel Aircraft listed six. Five used Dassault jets sold; andsingle resales were reported for Canadair, Gulfstream, Lockheed andMitsubishi.   Revised October figures showed 24 new jets delivered to U.S. customers.Cessna picked up five with deliveries of three more CitationJets and twomore Ultras.   Learjet added three more 31A models. Raytheon added one Hawker 1000, oneHawker 1000B and one Beechjet 400A. Canadair sold two more 601-3Rs. Inaddition, Dassault delivered its second Falcon 2000 and Gulfstream itssecond IVSP.   October resale numbers were revised to add 29 units, bringing the totalto 68.   Through November 1995 domestic deliveries of new jets totaled 179-41more than during the first eleven months of 1994. Resales totaled 828-34fewer than the same period last year.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   DOMESTIC TURBOPROP SALES   One U.S. turboprop sale was listed in November 1995-British Aerospace'sJetstream 41. Eight new sales were reported during November 1994.   There were 27 resales compared to 66 last November. Raytheon listed 15Beech models, while Piper posted four. Convair, Mitsubishi and Swearingeneach listed two deliveries of used turboprops, and Cessna and Gulfstreameach closed single resales.   Revised October figures added four deliveries to the total-two RaytheonKing Air B200s, one King Air 350 and one Saab 2000.   Late reports of domestic activity brought total turboprop resales inOctober to 64 compared with the earlier recorded total of 28.   Through November 1995, 52 new turboprops had been delivered to U.S.customers, down from 54 in 1994.

The preliminary figures included two Dassault Falcon900Bs and one Gulfstream IVSP.   There were three resales-two Raytheon models, one Dassault-down from 15jets in November 1994.   Revised October figures added no new overseas jet sales, although sixresales brought that total to eight.   Year to date, international sales of new jets fell to a total of 52aircraft, compared to 67 jet deliveries during the first eleven months of1994. Resales have dropped to 132 units compared to 216 during the sameperiod last year.   One new turboprop was sold overseas in November-Raytheon's King AirC90A. One sale was also listed in November 1994.   No resales have yet been reported for the month, down from 15 deliveredto new owners last November. International figures usually increase asofficial information becomes available.   Revised October data added two turboprop sales to the total, a secondKing Air 350 and one C90B. Resales increased by three to ten.   By November, 30 turboprops had been delivered overseas, nine more thanin 1994 and eight more than in all of last year. International resales,however, had fallen to 155 from 1994's total of 216.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBUSINESS & COMMERCIAL AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1996   THE EMB 145: REGIONAL JET OR TURBOPROP SANS PROPS?Embraer's new regional jet will not give the Canadair Regional Jet much ofa competitive tussle; the Saab 2000 is another story.By:Arnold Lewis   The Embraer EMB-145 was originally conceived in early 1989 as a45-passenger, stretched Brasilia designed to meet the growth needs of theAmerican Eagle carriers in the mid-1990s.20 AMR Eagle took 50 options on the 50-passenger Saab 2000 high-speedturboprop, and that was ostensibly the end of that competition. Ironically,the 145 has rolled out and is in flight test as a 50-passenger regionaljet, and AMR Eagle still has not exercised any options for the Saab 2000.Indeed, competition between the two aircraft may only be beginning.20 Three months after AMR took its Saab 2000 options, the 145 re-emergedas a regional jet. But it still looked like a turboprop. The nacellesrested atop the basic Brasilia wing, which included a chord extension atthe leading edge and a super-critical airfoil with a 14-percent rootthickness; the nacelles simply contained a turbofan rather than aturboprop. Embraer engineers reckoned that the configuration would save thebuyer $3 million in price over aft-mounted turbofans, which would haverequired a redesign of the wing and the main landing gear installation.Engineers were looking for improved field performance resulting from the``blown-wing'' effect.20 Engineers reasoned that the configuration would also minimizeforeign-object damage, reduce inlet-airflow distortion and diminish thefly-over noise signature due to engine shielding by the wing. ``It will notbe the fastest regional jet, but it certainly will be the mosteconomical,'' said then-Embraer Chief Executive Ozilio da Silva. Hiscomparison was the Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ).20 The problem was that wind-tunnel testing showed that the configurationresulted in compressibility problems that would offset hoped-forperformance results. The engineers went to an under-wing engineinstallation with a swept-wing, similar to the Boeing 737's. That metperformance requirements, but produced ground-clearance and maintenanceproblems at the same time. In addition, commonality with the Brasilia wasdiminished.ENGINES MOVED AFT   When Embraer's founding chief executive, Ozires Silva, returned to thecompany in 1991 from a five-year hiatus as president of state-owned oilcompany Petrobras and a stint in Brasilia as super-minister ofinfrastructure, he ``moved the engines to the tail and put firm controls onthe aircraft specs. The letters of intent were based on firm specs,especially operating costs and weight of structure,'' he told B/CA in arecent interview (December 1995, page C6).20 Ozires is proud of the fact that the airplane met its forecastspecifications, even down to the pound. In terms of maximum takeoff weight,the 145 is 8,672 pounds lighter than the CRJ, and 7,937 pounds less thanthe Saab 2000. Its zero-fuel weight is 6,302 pounds less than the CRJ and5,702 less than the 2000-for the same number of passenger seats. The CRJnumbers are for the extended-range version, for which most customers areopting.20 ``Published'' prices of the Saab 2000 and EMB-145 are identical at$14.5 million each. The CRJ comes in at $18.6 million. Based on emptyoperating weight, those prices equate to $480, $568 and $617 per pound,respectively. Put another way, the 2000 and 145 come in at $290,000 perpassenger seat each, and the CRJ at $372,000 per seat.20 Other than the fact that one is a turboprop and the other aturbofan-albeit powered by the same Allison Engine Company core turbine-theSaab 2000 and EMB-145 are amazingly similar in terms of performance andproductivity (see chart). B/CA measures productivity by operating aircraftover continuous segments of 150, 275, 400 and 800 statute miles,respectively, within the confines of a 14-hour duty day.20 Optimum climb and cruise is selected for each aircraft, as is cruisealtitude. Ten minutes are used for taxi and takeoff, with descent to sealevel and no allowance for approach and landing. The profile allows for a45-minute hold plus a 30-minute diversion, all at cruise altitude andspeed, which produces an apples-to-apples comparison.TURBOPROP TOPS SHORT HOPS   In the 150-sm mission, the Saab 2000 produces 13 total segments and97,500 total available seat miles. Block speed is 195 knots with a blockfuel burn of 990 pounds. Both the 145 and the CRJ produce 14 daily segmentsover the relatively short stage length and turn in an identical 105,000seat miles. Block speeds are 219 and 226 knots, respectively, and blockfuel is 1,222 and 1,325 pounds, respectively. (All EMB-145 data used inthis comparison are preliminary.)   At 275 sm, the CRJ jumps out ahead, with 12 daily trips compared to 10each for the 2000 and 145. Seat-mile production is 165,000 for the CRJversus 137,500 each for the 2000 and 145. The CRJ produces a block speed of309 knots, compared to 246 for the 2000 and 265 for the 145.20 Seat-mile production for the 2000 and the 145 are identical as well at400 and 800 sm, at 160,000 and 200,000, respectively. The CRJ produces200,000 seat miles at 400 miles and 240,000 at 800 miles.20 Mileage production is not the only factor, however. Field distancetips the scales to the turboprop. The Saab 2000, despite a takeoff weighthigher than the 145's, turns in an SL/ISA balanced field length of lessthan 4,400 feet. That compares to more than 4,900 feet for the 145 and morethan 6,000 for the CRJ. Bump those airport conditions up to 5,000 feet andISA+ 20C, and the distances jump to 6,100, 8,450 and 9,900 feet,respectively.20 All-engine climb rates for the 2000 and 145 are identical at 2,380feet per minute, compared to 3,200 fpm for the CRJ. Cruise speeds atoptimum altitude for the 2000, 145 and CRJ produced block speeds of 280,350 and 370 knots, respectively.20 But in terms of tankering fuel-when contract fuel is not available atthe outstations, the 2000 produced seven stages per fueling in the 150-smmission, versus three each for the 145 and CRJ. At 275 sm, the spread wasthree, two and three, respectively. It is two stages across the board at400 sm and one, one and two at 800 sm.31-INCH PITCH VS. FOUR-ABREAST   The 2000 has the advantage on seat pitch at 32 inches versus 31 inchesfor the two jets. It also tops the 145 in cross-section-7.1 feet comparedto 6.9 for the 145 and 8.4 for the CRJ. The latter offers four-abreastseating versus three each for the 2000 and the 145. All are derivatives ofearlier aircraft, the Saab 340, EMB-120 Brasilia and Canadair Challengerbusiness jet, respectively.20 Embraer officials like to talk about their ``back to basics'' approachto the design and development of the 145. They have good reason. Theearlier CBA-123 pusher-turboprop development program-a 70/30 partnershipwith Argentina's Fabrica Militar de Aviones (FMA)-was a financial disaster.The 19-passenger aircraft had all the bells and whistles, and the costsrocketed. Realistic price estimates ranged from $6 million to $8 million.That compares with around $4 million for existing 19-passenger aircraft.20 With Ozires Silva back at the helm, operating costs and weight becameprimary considerations in the development of the 145, as well as the ``backto basics'' rationale-''technology in the right measure to meet with thedemands of operators worldwide.'' That rationale was based on fouractions:   -- Take advantage of state-of-the-art technology while aiming atreducing costs;   -- Maximize commonality with the EMB-120 Brasilia and CBA-123Vector;   -- Apply concurrent engineering to avoid modifications during theproduction phase; and   -- Make comprehensive, extensive use of the latest CAD tools, such asthe use of electronic mock-ups, to reduce production costs. The companysaid that over 20,000 computerized drawings were generated in EMB-145development.MANY RISK-SHARERS   The manufacturer also made extensive use of risk-sharing partnerships tospread the cost of development. Estimated at $300 million, the cost wassplit as follows: 33 percent from risk-sharing partners, 10 percent fromparticipating suppliers, 23 percent from Brazilian development fundinginstitutions, and 34 percent from Embraer itself.20 The risk-sharing partners are:   -- Gamesa of Spain-wings and nacelles, in association with INS ofNorthern Ireland; and wing-to-fuselage fairings, main landing gear doorsand leading edges, in association with Sonaca of Belgium.   -- C&D Interiors of the United States-passenger cabin/cargo compartmentinteriors.   -- Sonaca of Belgium-center fuselage, main door, service door, rearfuselage, pylons and baggage door.   -- Enaer of Chile-vertical fin, horizontal stabilizer and elevators.20 There are some 28 U.S. suppliers for the 145 in non-risk-sharingcapacities, not the least of which is Allison Engine Company. Embraer wasthe launch customer for the AE3007, although Cessna got the engine airbornefirst on the Citation X business jet.20 The 145 installation calls for 7,475 pounds of maximum takeoff thrust,or an alternate takeoff rating of 6,930 pounds. It is a 5:1 high-bypassturbofan with one accessory gearbox driven by the gas-generator spool. Thegas generator spool incorporates a 14-stage compressor driven by atwo-stage turbine. The installation incorporates Full Authority DigitalEngine Controls (FADEC) without mechanical back-up.20 An AlliedSignal auxiliary power unit is mounted in the tail asstandard equipment. It supplies pressurized air for the aircraft pneumaticsystem and is an electrical power source either simultaneously orindependently from the aircraft electrical system.20 Up front, the 145 offers what Embraer calls a ``quiet and dark''cockpit, designed for crew comfort during all phases of flight. Theavionics system is the Honeywell Primus 1000 and incorporates a five-tube,eight- by seven-inch glass cockpit. Primary Flight Displays (PFDs) are atthe far left and right of the panel, framing dual Multi-Function Displays(MFDs) for navigation displays, weather radar and TCAS advisories. Theyalso can show maintenance data as well as checklists. The center unit isdedicated to EICAS primary indications.COMPOSITES EMPLOYED   The 145 incorporates a fair amount of composites. Wing panels andcontrol surfaces, and landing-gear doors are either carbon/Nomex orcarbon/Kev-lar. Interior panels, radome and wing-to-fuselage fairings areof fiberglass or fiberglass/Nomex. The vertical-fin leading edge andfairing is Kevlar or a combination of that and fiberglass or Nomex.Interior flooring is a sandwich panel of either carbon/Nomex orfiberglass/Nomex.20 The basic airframe structure is of aluminum construction with formedsheet, machined and extruded parts. Chemical milling is used extensivelyfor a better fatigue/weight combination. The structure is designed to meetdamage-tolerance criteria except for the landing gear, where the safe-lifeconcept is applied. The structure is designed for 75,000 flight hours or60,000 cycles.20 Four aircraft will be engaged in a 13-month, 1,300-hour certificationflight-test program that actually got under- way prior to the airplane'sofficial rollout in August 1995. They will be the prototype-Serial Number801-plus three pre-production series aircraft-Serial Number 001, 002 and003. The latter will later be refurbished and sold in the market. Two otherstructures-Serial Number 802 and 803-will be used in static and fatiguetests. Certification and initial customer delivery will take place latethis year.20 The initial production rate will be three per month, to be reached in1998, but that rate can be increased to a maximum of four per month. Thecompany plans to build 24 this year. Officials during a rollout went out ona limb by suggesting that the program could break even at between 200 and250 airplanes. Predicting break-even production, however, is a``never-never land'' seldom reached. Still, the company expects to secure40 percent of what it says is a worldwide market for 1,000 fast regionalaircraft over the next 10 years, with two-thirds of that market in theUnited States.20 There are only 18 firm orders, plus 16 options, for theairplane-Flight West of Australia and Regional Airlines of France are theearly customers. But the manufacturer and the Brazilian government arestill engaged in establishing a government-backed financial scheme tosupport the sales (B/CA, December 1995, page C6).20 Embraer sees its customer base as current operators of the EMB-120Brasilia. Indeed, prominent during rollout ceremonies in August wereexecutives of Delta Connection carriers Comair and SkyWest, both largeBrasilia fleet operators that also operate the CRJ.20 One told B/CA that it is a perception thing. ``The perception is thatturboprops are small airplanes.''

Aarons   We've all heard that accidents usually befall us not because of a singlecatastrophic event, but rather as the culmination of the unidirectionalalignment of a long series of relatively benign events. There is no betterexample of this phenomenon than the loss of USAir Flight 1016 in awind-shear encounter on July 2, 1994 at Charlotte/Douglas InternationalAirport in Charlotte, North Carolina. Thirty-seven passengers were killed,and 14 others were seriously injured when the DC-9-31 collided with treesand a private residence as the pilots attempted to execute a missedapproach from the Runway 18R ILS. The captain and first officer, one flightattendant and one passenger suffered minor injuries.   The NTSB said the probable causes of this accident were:   (1) The flightcrew's decision to continue an approach into severeconvective activity that was conducive to a microburst,   (2) The flightcrew's failure to recognize a wind-shear situation in atimely manner,   (3) The flightcrew's failure to establish and maintain the properairplane attitude and thrust setting necessary to escape the wind shear,and   (4) The lack of real-time adverse weather and wind-shear hazardinformation dissemination from ATC.   All of these factors led to an encounter with, and failure to escapefrom, a microburst-induced wind shear that was produced by a rapidlydeveloping thunderstorm located at the approach end of Runway 18R.   Contributing to the accident, said the Safety Board, were:   -- The lack of ATC procedures that would have required the controllerto display and issue ASR-9 radar weather information to the pilots offlight 1016,   -- Charlotte tower supervisor's failure to properly advise and ensurethat all controllers were aware of and reporting a reduction in visibilityand the runway visual range (RVR) value information along with thelow-level wind-shear alerts that had occurred in multiple quadrants,   -- The inadequate remedial actions by USAir to ensure adherence tostandard operating procedures, and   -- The inadequate software logic in the airplane's wind-shear warningsystem that did not provide an alert upon entry into the wind shear.   In addition to the causal factors, the NTSB made the additionalobservation that this accident occurred despite the following aspects inthe flight's favor:   (1) The flightcrew had received extensive training on CRM techniques aswell as wind-shear avoidance and escape;   (2) The airplane was equipped with modern wind-shear detection andescape avionics;   (3) The airport was equipped with a low-level wind-shear alertingsystem;   (4) ATC personnel were looking at a mean thunderstorm with asophisticated ASR-9 scope and with their eyeballs;   (5) The aircraft had enough power to climb out of the microburst itencountered; and   (6) The flightcrew ultimately made the proper decision to abort theapproach.   To understand what happened, you need a feeling for the timeline. NTSBinvestigators put it together this way:   The crew began a planned three-day sequence from Pittsburgh (PIT) at0945 hours on the morning of the accident. The trip segments for the dayincluded en route stops at La Guardia (LGA), Charlotte (CLT) and Columbia,South Carolina (CAE), followed by a return trip to CLT and a final stop inMemphis (MEM). The accident oc-curred on the fourth leg from CAE to CLTwhile the first officer was performing the duties of the flying pilot.   The flight departed CAE on schedule at 1823 hours. The forecast weatherfor CLT was pretty much as it had been when the crew cycled through the CLThub earlier that afternoon, except for the additional notation of``scattered thunderstorms in the area.'' A minute after the airplane brokeground for the 35-minute flight, the captain made contact with CharlotteTRACON's arrival west controller and reported the crew had ATIS for CLT.   During the short en route leg at 12,000 feet, the cockpit voice recorder(CVR) picked up routine ATC and cockpit discussions, including indicationsthat crewmembers were analyzing radar returns and planning their arrivalthoughtfully. Six minutes after departure, the first officer commented,``There's more rain than I thought there was . . . it's starting . . .pretty good a minute ago . . . now it's held up.'' A minute later, thecaptain radioed the approach controller and stated, ``We're gonna swingjust five degrees to the right here just for about uh a quarter . . . halfmile.'' The controller approved the request.   As they approached the Charlotte area from the south-southwest,crewmembers observed two cells on their airborne weather radar-one locatedsouth and the second located east of the airport. The radar return from thecell south of the airport had a red center surrounded by yellow edges.   At 1832 hours, the captain began a three-minute conversation with thearrival controller about possible deviations as the aircraft maneuvered forthe approach. The flight was issued a clearance to descend to 6,000 feet,and was switched to the final radar west (FRW) controller who cleared it ondown to 4,000 feet and told it to expect Runway 18R.   The captain acknowledged the transmission, and then stated to the firstofficer, ``Approach brief.'' The first officer responded, ``visual back upILS.'' The controller then issued a clearance to Flight 1016 to ``. . .turn 10 degrees right, descend and maintain two thousand three hundred,vectors visual approach runway one eight right.'' About this same time, thetower supervisor made the remark in the tower cab that it was ``raininglike hell at the south end of the airport, and the FEW controller looked atthe airport surveillance radar (ASR-9) and observed a VIP level-three cell``pop-up'' near the airport.   At 1836:55, ``the FRW controller radioed flight 1016 and said, ``I'lltell you what USAir ten sixteen, they got some rain just south of thefield, might be a little bit coming off north, just expect the ILS now,amend your altitude maintain three thousand.'' The USAir captainacknowledged the transmission.   Meanwhile, on another frequency, the local east controller was warningan arriving DHC-8 of ``heavy, heavy rain on the airport now, wind one fivezero at one four.'' At this point, the FRW controller turned Flight 1016onto the final approach course, and told the crew to maintain 3,000 to themarker and then contact the tower. The crew had visual contact with theairport and could see rain.   While Flight 1016 was still with the FRW controller, USAir 806 wastaxiing for takeoff and discussing the weather with a local controller.``And [this is] eight-o-six, looks like we've gotten a storm right on thetop of the field here.'' The local controller responded, ``affirmative.''   In the cockpit of Flight 1016, the captain told the first officer, ``Ifwe have to bail out . . . it looks like we bail out to the right.'' Thiswas followed by the captain saying, ``chance of shear.''   At 1839:38, the captain checked in with the local controller, whoreplied, ``USAir ten sixteen . . . runway one eight right, cleared to landfollowing an F-K one hundred short final. Previous arrival [USAir 677, aFokker FK-28 that landed about four minutes earlier] reported a smooth rideall the way down the final.'' The captain responded, ``USAir ten sixteen,I'd appreciate a PIREP from that guy in front of us. [The airplanereferenced by the captain of Flight 1016 was USAir Flight 984, a FokkerFK-100 that had circled from Runway 23 to land on 18R.] The LCW controllerrelayed the report of a ``smooth ride'' to Flight 1016.   Later the captain and first officer testified that the ``edge of therain'' was a ``thin veil'' through which they could see the runway, and itwas located ``between us and the runway.''   About 1836 hours, a special weather observation was recorded, and a newATIS was prepared, reporting a thunderstorm on the airport. The informationwas not broadcast until 1843 hours. The flightcrew of USAir 1016 neverreceived it.   At 1840:37, the LCE controller advised USAir Flight 52, a Boeing 737departing Runway 18L, ``. . . aircraft just departed ahead of you saidsmooth ride on departure wind is one zero zero at one niner gusting twoone.'' USAir Flight 52 was then issued a takeoff clearance.   At 1840:50, the LCW controller said, ``USAir ten sixteen, wind now oneone zero at two one.''   At 1841:05, the CVR recorded the captain saying, ``stay heads up,'' andthe LCW controller's radio transmission of ``wind-shear alert northeastboundary, wind one nine zero at one three.'' Meanwhile, at 1841:08, the LCEcontroller had transmitted, ``attention all aircraft, wind-shear alert, thesurface wind one zero at two zero, northeast boundary wind one nine zero atone six.'' However, the LACE radio transmission occurred on a differentradio frequency and was not heard by the crew of Flight 1016.   At 1841:17, the LCW controller issued a landing clearance to theaircraft following Flight 1016, and also reported that the wind was ``. . .one zero zero at two zero, wind-shear alert northeast boundary wind, oneniner zero at one seven.'' At 1841:54, the CVR recorded the captain'scomment ``here come the wipers,'' followed three seconds later by the soundof rain.   The first officer commented, ``There's, ooh, 10 knots right there.''This was followed by the captain saying, ``Okay, you're plus 20 [knots] . . .take it around, go to the right.'' The NTSB later concluded that thecaptain was unaware that the airplane had penetrated the first part of amicroburst and, therefore, commanded the first officer to execute astandard missed approach rather than a wind-shear escape procedure. Thecaptain would later recall that the airplane was about 450 feet agl when heordered the missed approach. The flight data recorder (FDR) tape indicatedthe airplane was closer to 200 feet agl at that time.   The flight had 21 seconds to go before impact.   The captain radioed ``USAir ten sixteen's on the go,'' and then said,``max power.'' The first officer said, ``yeah max power.''The FDR recordedan increase in engine power to 1.82 EPR, which actually was below thestandard go-around limit of 1.93. The first officer had established theappropriate 15-degree nose-up attitude and had begun to enter a17-degree-banked turn to the right.   The tower controller, said, ``USAir ten sixteen, understand you're onthe go sir, fly runway heading, climb and maintain three thousand.''The first officer called for ``flaps to fifteen.'' Two seconds later, thecaptain said to the first officer, ``down, push it down'' and then radioedto the tower controller, ``up to three we're taking a right turn.''The tower controller responded, ``USAir ten sixteen, understand you'returning right.''   Then, the CVR recorded the GPWS aural alert (whoop, whoop, terrain), andan unidentified voice calling ``power.'' Over the next two seconds, the CVRpicked up sounds similar to a stick-shaker activation, and then sounds ofground impact.   Later analysis showed that Flight 1016 encountered a microburst aboutsix seconds after initiating the missed approach from Runway 18R. Themicroburst was generated by convective activity that was centered near theeast side of Runway 18R and that had cloud tops at 30,000 feet. It wasabout 3.5 kilometers in diameter and was capable of producing a rainfallrate of about 10 inches per hour. Total wind change near the ground wasabout 75 knots, with the strongest downward vertical winds, below 300 feetagl, calculated to be 600 fpm to 1,200 fpm. Pilots on the ground and in theair reported that the thunderstorm appeared as a small echo approximatelythree miles in diameter, and indicated ``mostly red'' on the radar.   Computations indicate that during the initial climb, after the missedapproach was initiated and during the final descent (to within two to threeseconds of ground impact), the wind along the flight path changedsignificantly. Computations revealed that the wind shifted from a headwindof about 35 knots to a tailwind of about 26 knots in 15 seconds. Thevertical-velocity component of the wind field was also examined, and it wasdetermined that the vertical-wind velocity increased from about 600fpm-down to about 1,500 fpm-down, and increased further to 1,800 fpm-downas the airplane attained its maximum altitude and made the transition intoa descent.   Safety Board investigators, using simulators to explore DC-9-31performance limits, determined the accident aircraft could have flown outof this microburst if the first officer had maintained a 15-degree nose-uppitch, and if the power had been set properly. But the first officerresponded to the captain's command of ``down, push it down,'' thus changingthe aircraft's pitch attitude from 15-degrees nose-up to five-degreesnose-down over a seven-second period.   Why did the captain give this command? The investigators don't know,because the captain testified that he did not recall issuing it. However,the Safety Board believes a likely explanation is that during the lastminute of flight, the captain-upon losing his visual cues instantaneouslywhen the airplane encountered heavy rain-could have experienced a form ofspatial disorientation.   This disorientation, said the NTSB, ``might have led him to believe thatthe aircraft was climbing at an excessively high rate and that the pitchattitude should be lowered to prevent an aerodynamic stall.'' When theairplane encountered the heavy rain, said the investigators, the flightcrewwould have lost their outside horizon visual reference. Also, it might nothave been possible for the captain to regain situational focus on theprimary flight instruments because he was performing other tasks.   Further, because the flightcrew was initiating the missed approach(which involved a large increase in engine thrust, a pronounced increase inpitch attitude, and a banked turn to the right), the crew would have beenexposed to significant linear and angular accelerative forces. These forcescould have stimulated the flightcrew's vestibular and proprioceptivesystems, and produced a form of spatial disorientation known assomatogravic illusion.   How about the first officer's actions? The Safety Board analyzed themthis way: As the flying pilot, the first officer would have maintained ascan of several instruments. These instruments would have given him thebest situational awareness by providing essential information aboutairspeed, altitude and attitude. However, he reacted to the captain'scommand without challenging it. One of the principles in the practice ofcrew resource management (CRM) is the uninhibited challenge of the captainby the first officer when an unsafe condition exists or an inappropriatecommand has been issued.   The Safety Board ``believes that the first officer should have beenfully aware of the airplane's proximity to the ground when the captaincommanded the missed approach [200 feet agl], as well as their altitude[350 feet agl] when the captain commanded, `Down, push it down.' Thus, thefirst officer's immediate reaction should have been to challenge theimpropriety of the command rather than reacting first.''   The NTSB felt that the flightcrew members' comfortable workingrelationship set up the environment for the CRM failure. For example, theyhad conducted casual conversations during parts of the flight in whichsterile cockpit procedures should have been in effect; they violatedcompany SOPs in the way they conducted checklists and briefings; and,together, they lost situational awareness in the end.   Of course, they were getting a lot of help in the negative sense fromeverything else that was happening (or not happening) at the time. Forexample, most of the ATC-pilot chatter about the developing cell was onother frequencies, not the ones they were working. The low-level wind-shearalerts were not sufficiently transmitted to them. All of their simulatortraining had associated wind shear with turbulence, and no turbulenceoccurred in this microburst event. And, the wind-shear detection system onboard did not function properly and did not warn crewmembers of theencounter.   The NTSB issued several recommendations to the FAA after itsinvestigation into this accident. Most are on the subject of gettingweather information from various ATC positions to the cockpit. Otherrecommendations call for improving training to emphasize the importance ofCRM and sterile cockpit concepts. Still others have to do with the softwareproblems that caused the airborne wind-shear detection system to fail.   This accident, like most, simply should not have happened, yet it did.And that's the lesson we must take away from it. As we've seen, all humanand mechanical systems designed to prevent such mishaps failed in thisincident.   In the end, we are reminded that flying airplanes requires us to be evervigilant.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List WT03-B28-21IA059-000320-B036-33http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae10.html 205.156.212.5 19970114201534 text/html 31645HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:12:59 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:15 GMTContent-length: 31458Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae10.html Sample Issue Copyright CNS OUTLOOK via NewsNet January 24, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES CNS/ATM PERSPECTIVE SO WHAT'S UP WITH FREE FLIGHT?

With the conclusion of the RTCA Task Force on free flight,the publicly visible activity on this fast rising endeavor hasdropped down a couple of notches. Publicly, the industry is awaitingthe formal response of FAA Administrator Hinson to the Task Forcereport and recommendations. At a less visible level, there is muchafoot. The outcome of these activities will go far to determine theeventual success or failure of the free flight effort, as well asidentify who will emerge as the key players in the ongoingevolution of our airspace system.       There is little doubt among industry observers that the FAAwill roundly endorse the Task Force report. The most likely scenariois some sort of public meeting, probably in the DC area, within thenext 3-4 weeks, at which FAA will endorse the report, outline howit intends to move on the report recommendations, and introduce toindustry the members and structure of the key Free Flight SteeringCommittee, which has quietly been organized over the past 4 weeks.       This Steering Committee of high ranking and prestigiousindividuals from the aviation community will exist and operate underthe auspices of RTCA. It will provide the forum for the much neededindustry/government collaboration in carrying out the evolvingrequirements of the emerging CNS/ATM system. It will be led by twoco-chairs, one from industry and one from government, both highranking individuals who have the position and the power to helpensure that the Steering Committee's actions are taken seriously inboth camps and are carried out expeditiously.       On the industry side, the notion and even the phrase freeflight have taken hold more quickly than anyone could haveanticipated. It is almost impossible to read any industry tradepublication without seeing these magic words. Daily mention incompany press releases is common.       Special free flight marketing packages abound. I just receivedone of the most clever mailings from one of the giant avionicsmanufacturers, in a large box, delivered by express mail, whichincluded a "free flight" frisbee, a well-written pamphlet on thebackground and concept of free flight, and a second booklet mappingthe products and services of the company to the requirements offree flight in a CNS/ATM environment.       Companies are jockeying for position, each trying to presentitself as an organization that can contribute successfully to theevolution of the airspace system, in accordance with the free flightconcept. The MITRE Corporation recently held the first of anintended series of invitation-only meetings that deal with specificfree flight issues and the technologies that will support them.       Interesting and valuable forums for moving the conceptforward, these meetings are also clearly intended to ensure MITREcarves out a key position in this rapidly changing industry. Othercompanies are striving for the same end, many forming "strategicpartnerships" that combine key business and technology talents andexperience, and better position the resulting entity to win a largeshare of the developing CNS/ATM market.       On the government side, work is rapidly progressing on thedocumenting of the official FAA architecture of the nationalairspace system. It is certain that the Task Force report is beingused as a key input to this process. The first cut at thisarchitecture document is due out next month.       Although we have no formal FAA response to the free flightreport, this has been a busy and interesting two months. Theintensity of activity can only increase once the FAA goes publicwith its endorsement.Back to Headline List CopyrightCNS OUTLOOK via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996FAA REPORTS FURTHER PROGRESS ON DGPS PSEUDOLITE APPROACH NAVIGATION       FAA recently reported the successful conclusion of a secondround of feasibility testing on local area DGPS with pseudolite (PL)augmentation for approach navigation. The FAA Technical Center andStanford Telecommunications (STel) have been investigating thefeasibility of using PLs to improve DGPS system availability andcontinuity of function. STel has a contract to develop a code-basedDGPS nav system that uses PLs both as a data link and as a rangingsource. Actual flight tests were completed in November.       By using PLs as ranging sources, the number of GPS satellitesneeded to meet RNP standards is decreased, thereby increasing systemavailability. It is expected that the PL will also increase systemaccuracy. In the flight tests, differential corrections weretransmitted via the PLs to the aircraft in a WAAS-compatible formatat 250 baud. The tests were conducted in ILS look-alike approachesof 3 degrees from 12 nmi out. The Center's Convair 580 was used forall flight testing.       Due to a software glitch, the tests were unable to validatethe expected improvements in system accuracy. Use of the PL as adata link transmitter was successful. The PL used the same antennasystem as is used to receive signals from the GPS constellation, PLtransmissions did not interfere with the signals from GPSsatellites, and the transmitted corrections were sufficient toenable the GPS receivers to calculate a real-time differentialsolution.       The LAAS program office is reportedly considering funding asecond phase of such tests to further explore the possible andpotential roles that PLs might play as a component of the LAASarchitecture.Back to Headline List CopyrightCNS OUTLOOK via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996PETAL PROGRAM CONTINUES IN EUROPE       Since last May, Eurocontrol and Aerospatiale have beenconducting "real world" trials of data link on Airbus aircrafttransiting Maastricht airspace. The Preliminary Eurocontrol Test ofAir/ground data Link (PETAL) aims to capture first hand operationalrequirements feed-back and increase operational awareness of thepotential value of data link in an ATC environment.       The aircraft being used are all Airbus aircraft being ferriedfrom the Toulouse, France, assembly plant to the DASA plant inHamburg, Germany. Each aircraft is equipped with an FMS, ACARS MU,VHF3 radio, and a specially configured ACARS MCDU. Controllers use atouch panel input device and electronic data display for messageinput and display. Data link messages are transmitted over the SITAnetwork using AEEC, SITATEX, and AIRCOM compliant message formats.       PETAL allows aircrews and controllers to carry out ATC commsby air/ground data link daily. Specific exchanges include: ATCrequests, clearances, and acknowledgments for flight levels anddirect routing; ATC instructions and acknowledgments for voicefrequency management; manual downlink of aircrew preferences such astop-of-descent and flight levels; and automatic, periodic downlinkof airborne data such as winds.Back to Headline List CopyrightCNS OUTLOOK via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996STUDY: FAA SHOULD REPLACE ATC CENTER POWER SYSTEMS QUICKLY       A team of electric power experts says the FAA should continueto replace the power systems at the nation's 21 Air Route TrafficControl Centers (ARTCCs), but warns that the transition to the newsystems ought to be made as quickly as possible.       "The existing systems are sufficiently reliable to be useduntil transition is complete, assuming that the FAA keeps to theplanned two-year schedule," writes the Blue Ribbon Power Outage Teamin a report released Jan. 19. "The old systems are deteriorating,though, and it is imperative that replacements be installed as soonas is feasible."       The $350-million program to replace ARTCC Critical/EssentialPower Systems (ACEPS) is under way and scheduled for completion nextyear.       In the meantime, the panel, formed last year, had almost 50recommendations, including:       *  Enhance training of power-system technicians;       *  Improve training on the transition to ACEPS equipment, andincrease communication among centers; and       *  Review the management of critical and essential powersystems.       The FAA says the recommendations either have been implementedor are being examined.  ...FAA Needs Money to Train ATC Technicians       Until new computer hardware and software arrives at thenation's ARTCCs [see chart at right], FAA technicians will have tomake do with what's there. But the FAA doesn't have enough money totrain the technicians: the agency requested $30 million for trainingthis fiscal year but got only $23 million.       "My highest priority is to find the money for this training,"said Monte Belger, FAA Associate Administrator for Air TrafficServices.       Developing a training plan is one of more than four dozensteps the FAA says it is taking to minimize the problems caused bythe aging computer equipment at the ARTCCs. Some of the equipmentis decades old, and breakdowns last year delayed thousands oftravelers, and focused media and congressional pressure on the FAA.       In the second of two reports released Jan. 19, the agencyoutlined steps it is taking to reduce the effects of futurebreakdowns.       Among the steps are:       *  Revamp contingency plans at the 21 centers and test them;       *  Do a better job of getting input from workers at thecenters about acquisition of new equipment;       *  Establish a national process for disseminating informationabout problems at the centers and lessons learned from the problems.       Belger said Jan. 19 he didn't yet know how much it will costto implement all of the plans.Back to Headline List CopyrightCNS OUTLOOK via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996AIRWAYS OF NEW ZEALAND SELECTS ARINC TO PROVIDE DATA LINK FOR FANSI       AIRWAYS Corporation of New Zealand (ACNZ) has selected ARINCInc. as its data link service provider for their FANS Icommunications service. The contract will facilitate air/groundcommunications in the Auckland Flight Information Region (FIR)during the final phase of ACNZ's upgrade to an automated ATCsystem. ARINC has provided internetworking communication servicesfor the ACNZ Oceanic ATC Automation Workstation since it becameoperational in September 1995.       The ARINC-provided services are scheduled to be operational intime for the site integration of the new ATC equipment in April.These include Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) andAutomatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS), linking air trafficcontrollers and flight crews of FANS 1-equipped aircraft.Participating aircraft must have Boeing's FANS 1 FMS enhancement forthe B747/400 or similar equipment on other aircraft types.       ARINC provides FANS I services to the FAA Oakland andAnchorage ARTCCs, which control the Pacific Ocean FIRs. It is alsoproviding similar services for operational trials of ATC automationin the Russian Far East.

This is the first timethat an INS on a B747 has been completely replaced by GPS, whichprovides sole means of navigation in revenue service.       The Trimble-equipped Evergreen B747 flew the first around theworld flight using only GPS for navigation, departing JFK onDecember 22 and returning on December 25. "In many of these casesthroughout the world, navigation and communications facilities fallshort of modern standards," said Peter Russo, Flight Captain forEvergreen. "The airlines sees the accuracy of GPS, transportableanywhere on the globe, as a big investment in flight safety, whichwill yield both economic and performance quality dividends fordecades to come."       Commenting on the specific operational benefits of GPS, Russoadded, the new GPS equipment "improves navigational accuracy andthus reduces the cost of freight transportation for our customers.Secondly, GPS allows Evergreen to participate in advanced oceanicnavigation routes requiring high precision to sequence aircraft moreefficiently. Lastly, the cost of GPS will be immediately recouped bythe avoidance of INS repair and replacement costs."Back to Headline List CopyrightCNS OUTLOOK via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996NEW SKYBLAZER XL GPS NAVIGATOR OFFERED BY MAGELLAN       Magellan has upgraded its SkyBlazer line by increasing thenumber of pixels in its new XL GPS Navigator to more than 20,000,providing ultra-high resolution for its moving map display. Thisgives pilots a more detailed, sharper picture of where they are andwhere they're going, according to Marc Henegar, Marketing and SalesManager of Magellan's Aviation Products Marketing group. "With finerdetail, screen clutter is significantly reduced and the image iscrystal clear, which greatly benefits the pilot's situationalawareness."

Designated the 5ATI display, the unit will replace existingFD-108, FD-109, and FD-110 electro-mechanical instruments. Collinsclaims the new unit will also provide the additional functionalityneeded by airlines for operation in the evolving CNS/ATMenvironment.       "To meet this requirement we've developed a family of 'drop-in' products designed to meet multiple market requirements andretrofit applications," according to Clay Jones, VP and GM of theCollins Air Transport Division.  The 5ATI retrofit family will beTSOd in about August 1996, per Collins, and will provide formatflexibility to permit easy transition for flight crews, with minimaltraining needed to master the added functionality selected by theairlines.       Based on experience and technology from the B777 program,Collins has developed the 5ATI display. It has a larger active areathan current displays, 4.2" x 4.2", and uses a proprietarytechnology that enables viewing angles of up to +/-60 degrees. Ithas a nominal MTBF of 12,000, roughly four times greater thantoday's electro-mechanical instruments. Acquisition cost isestimated by Collins to be about 50% of that of current displays.The unit is capable of future expansion to include weather radar,TCAS, and GPS navigation.Back to Headline List CopyrightCNS OUTLOOK via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996FAA SEEKS INFORMATION ON REPLACEMENT AIR-GROUND RADIO FOR FUTUREACQUISITION       The FAA has sent out a request for information in support ofa new program, the Next Generation Air/Ground Communications(Nex_Gen_A/G) program, to replace the air-to-ground system currentlyused for voice communications between pilots and air trafficcontrollers. FAA hopes to learn of the existence of a system thatis off-the-shelf and based on existing technology, rather than beforced to develop a system to meet its specific needs. This RFI ispart of a market survey to determine what products and technologiesare currently available, what developmental activities are underway, and what products/technologies are expected to be availablewithin the next five years.       The system FAA seeks must be capable of:       *  ensuring that available RF spectrum can be used efficientlyfor voice and data requirements;       *  reducing susceptibility to RFI;       *  improving communications system security;       *  supporting remote maintenance monitoring; and       *  providing consistent voice quality over a range ofoperating conditions.       The new system is expected to incorporate a multi-mode VHFradio using digital modulation and TDMA to provide a flexible mixof 25 kHz-separated voice and data channels. It should also bebackwards compatible with existing AM radios.

Aircraft Systems & Manufacturing (ASM), based in Georgetown,Texas, near Austin, is working to develop a standard for theintegration of global positioning system (GPS) equipment and otheravionics into the cockpits of commercial airliners.       "There are a lot of varying [integration] packages," says ASMPresident Dan McKenzie. "We want to come up with a universal designthat [can equip] Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas and Boeingaircraft."       Founded in 1987, the company now employs 30 people, and hascontracts worldwide. Although it has looked into all kinds ofaircraft, including the business jet and general aviation (GA)markets, ASM plans to keep integrating GPS systems into the higher-end commercial aircraft.        "We are concentrating on the 15,000 commercial aircraft in theUnited States," McKenzie says. "There is a 4-6 percent drop in thenumber of aircraft each year due to aircraft age. We are strongerdomestically, so we are going to aggressively target this market."       Among the company's projects is the updating of the cockpitsof about 140 Northwest Airlines DC-9s. Just last week, the companygot FAA supplemental type certification to integrate Honeywell-Trimble's HT 9000 GPS equipment into 16 Boeing 727s owned by Guam-based Continental Micronesia.       Although ASM is concentrating on U.S. commercial aviationmarkets, the world beckons. For example, a meeting late last yearbetween Federal Aviation Administration officials and members of theGulf Cooperation Council met to discuss GPS use in the Persian Gulfregion could spur GPS integration activities there. The companyrecently installed a satcom system on a Boeing 747 belonging to aGulf nation head of state, says Marnie Sablan, ASM's corporatecommunications manager.       The company also plans to market its integration kits togovernment agencies, including the military. "We've performedintegration for the U.S. Customs Agency. For us to look at themilitary market, we would have to assess their design criteria,"McKenzie says.       Although McKenzie admits the company does not offer the lowestcost GPS integration kit, he says buyers can tell the differencebetween ASM's and the other brands. "Some outfits are calling a fewconnectors, cables and a tray and are calling it a kit. It's a hugeambiguity that is reflected in cost," he says. "Sometimes the timeit takes to integrate kits cramps the styles of maintenancemanagers. We think we are unique in that we are not reactionary [tothe market]. We have conducted enough research to know that[aviation managers] do not want to integrate [GPS without]unnecessary cost."       McKenzie says aircraft manufacturers' decision-makers mustweigh cost vs. value. "The guy making the decision to buy [GPSintegration kits] has to evaluate the cost and the ability of acompany," he says. "They have to evaluate all of the elements --the kit, the ability to stick it into any airplane."       To speed the installation, ASM provides its customers withthree dimensional computer-developed designs. Later this year thecompany hopes to begin providing information to customers on-line,Sablan says. That, she says, would make it easy to provide updatesand changes to integration information.       A key to the company's GPS integration success, says LeonardOlson, ASM vice president of operations, is its ability to customizeits kits to an aircraft. That cuts integration time, in some casesdrastically. "Some integration companies take upwards of six monthsto [integrate GPS]," Olson says. "We are almost to the point thatwe can take any GPS design package and integrate it in a couple ofdays."Back to Headline List WT03-B28-22IA059-000320-B036-66http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae25.html 205.156.212.5 19970114201617 text/html 36070HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:14:24 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:24 GMTContent-length: 35883Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae25.html Sample Issue Copyright COMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES CANADA SIGNS AGREEMENT TO PRIVATIZE AIR NAVIGATION SERVICES (199 words) USAIR TAKES ON VALUJET AT WASHINGTON DULLES (159 words) MIDWEST EXPRESS CONTINUES EXPANSION (166 words) AIR SOUTH TO START BUSINESS-CLASS SECTION; EXPANDS TO FLORIDA (291 words) AIRTRAN AIRWAYS ACQUIRES TENTH 737-200 (107 words) EL PASO FEE HIKES CAUSE SOUTHWEST TO INCREASE LONG-HAUL FLYING...

Theaircraft are being acquired through Australian Aircraft Sales ofSydney, Australia. The aircraft are low-cycle models manufactured in1979.     The aircraft acquisition "is part of our ongoing strategy ofcontrolled and profitable growth," says Tim Hoeksema, president of theairline, which recently split from its parent company, Kimberly-ClarkCorp. so it could be free to grow and become a public firm.     The aircraft were added to Midwest Express' fleet last month andwill enter revenue service in April and May 1996. The aircraft alsowill be hush-kitted to comply with Stage III noise requirements.     The new planes give Midwest Express's  fleet of 21 aircraft, 19of which are DC-9s. Service between Milwaukee and Boston, Dallas/FortWorth and Philadelphia will be expanded using one of the newairframes, while the second will go to the airline's charter business.

The airline also will start new service toseveral southern U.S. destinations, mostly in Florida.     Air South Chief Financial Officer Tom Volz says the carrier willcharge $20 extra for an "up-front club section" seat and, at the sametime, will eliminate "lounge areas" it has had on its six Boeing 737s-200s.Air SouthStart-up Funding($ millions)S.C.

The airline has lowered costs from 14 cents per seat mile when itfirst flew last year to about 8 cents. It costs Air South 8.3 centsper seat mile to fly a 250-mile segment, Volz says.     The airline is expanding southward, mostly to the new focus areaof both Southwest Airlines and ValuJet Airlines: Florida. Air Southwill soon start non-stop service from South Carolina to Atlanta,Raleigh-Durham, Jacksonville and Myrtle Beach. New one-stops areplanned to Miami, Tallahassee and Tampa-St. Petersburg.      Air South executes a "hub-bypass strategy," says Volz, where theairline, for example, bypasses its Atlanta hub. The airline also willgo ticketless early in 1996 and expand into larger markets, includingChicago, Florida, New York and Washington.     "We have to be at least 11 units [aircraft] to realize advantagesof scale," says Volz, pointing to the carrier's need for five more737s.     Volz also says Air South, which received substantial assistancefrom the state of South Carolina, has put $12 million back into thestate's economy in 1995.

Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EL PASO FEE HIKES CAUSE SOUTHWEST TO INCREASE LONG-HAUL FLYING...     A decision by El Paso, Texas, airport officials to quadruplelanding fees is having the unintended consequence of creating newheadaches for airlines competing against Southwest Airlines.     Southwest said last month it will eliminate some services thathave connected through El Paso from origin points such as Houston andSan Antonio and create new non-stop services to the west coast.     The new Houston-Las Vegas and San Antonio-Los Angeles servicesrepresent a competitive threat to Continental Airlines, which operatesHouston-Las Vegas service from Intercontinental Airport. Southwest'sservice will originate from Houston Hobby Airport. Continentaloperates a competitive non-stop, point-to-point service between SanAntonio and Los Angeles, a Continental spokesman says.     Bill Owen, a schedule planner for Southwest, says, "It simply wasno longer feasible for us to fly those flights through El Paso," hesays. "Our San Antonio-LAX service had always been a one-stop throughEl Paso."     Southwest now has the greatest number of departures from LasVegas, and Owen says it will begin a small additional service nextyear. "It's just a bottomless pit for making money there," he says."It really is a rapidly growing city."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  ...WHILE LAX RAISES EYEBROWS BY DROPPING PFCs     Los Angeles International Airport has decided to stop collectinga $3 passenger facility charge beginning Jan. 1, becoming the firstairport to voluntarily discontinue the charge. The move surprised someindustry observers, but appears to be an isolated event, since theairport is holding open the option of applying for future PFC funding.     "Nearly 54 million southern Californians and others travelingfrom LAX will save approximately $60 million annually with thepassenger facility charge removed from their tickets," says JohnDriscoll, executive director of the Los Angeles Department ofAirports. "LAX is the first airport in the nation to discontinuecollecting PFCs," he emphasized.     The airport has stopped collecting the fee, says deputy executivedirector Jerald Lee, because it has collected $158 million and it isrunning out of time to spend the money. For instance, the FAA'sdeadline for using funds collected for a proposed people mover systemrun out next spring, but the airport is reconsidering the programaltogether. Instead, the airport is trying to redirect the funds to aterminal project at Ontario Airport, which is under review by airlinesand the FAA.      LAX likely will pursue PFC collections in the future since it isconsidering some $2 billion in renovations. "I don't think that there'sany question that we will" reapply for PFC collection, says Lee.     Some industry observers see other motives in LAX's action. PeterBianchini, an analyst for Standard & Poor's, says LAX's decision "is acontinued step in [the] direction to separate LAX from [revenuediversion regulations of] the federal government." He explains thatLos Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has supported diversion of airportrevenue into city coffers to be used for non-airport projects,something that is currently disallowed under federal laws governingPFCs. So LAX will simply stop collecting the PFCs, Bianchini suggests,to avoid the associated federal regulations.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996REGULATORY LOGItems in the Regulatory Log are based on agencyannouncements in the Federal Register unless otherwisenoted; Key: AD = Airworthiness Directive.

Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996THE AVRO RJ - PART V(Editor's Note: This is the next of a series reviewing the BAe 146 andits derivative, the Avro RJ. Paul Leighton, editor of sister-publication Aircraft Value News, reviews the customer list of the 146and RJ family.)     The 1995 list prices of the Avro range are, according to Avro,$20.6 million for the RJ70, $25 million for the RJ85, $28.4 millionfor the RJ100 and $29.7 million for the yet-to-be-ordered RJ115.    In some cases, the manufacturer may actually receive such amountsif the customer relies on BAe to provide finance. But for mostcustomers, the competition between regional jet manufacturers is suchthat transaction prices are probably much lower. To date, there havebeen few small orders. Those buyers ordering more than two likelysecured a reasonable discount.      Crossair, for example, is unlikely to have paid anything like$28.4 million each for the 10 RJ100s it ordered. Similarly, the 23orders placed by Sabena probably received a discount of at least 20%.Avro tends to provide realistic quotes of order value. For example,Avianca placed a further order for a single RJ100 example that Avroquoted as being worth $25 million.     The competition is intense among regional aircraft manufacturers,with the U.S. dollar's depreciation particularly crippling for non-U.S. manufacturers at present. Fokker has in the past been forced tosell aircraft at less than cost. Both Fokker and BAe have made itclear that they intend to reduce costs in the coming years. BAe hasmoved production of the RJ wings from Avro in the U.S. back to BAe inthe UK to better manage its costs and reduce the sum of dollar-basedcomponents. But the burden of further cost-reduction can be expected tofall on suppliers, given that BAe has already undertaken considerablecuts. It would appear that, if the price of new aircraft remains stableor even falls, used values will decline.      The RJ has been in service for less than two years and all RJsremain with the original customers, although Avro has leased out somefor short periods. There has thus been no market indication of used RJvalues. With deliveries just starting in quantity and in view of thequality of most customers, few if any RJs are likely to be availablesoon.      The problems of Business Express, which operates three RJ70s,suggest that, in the event no further deliveries are made, the existingRJ fleet will have to be eliminated. Avro will work hard to ensure thatthe balance of nine units is delivered within a reasonable time and thatthe three already in service remain so for the next few years. Failureto do so would raise the possibility that the RJ will be viewed in thesame way as its predecessor.(Next week: BAe 146 and Avro RJ values)Back to Headline List WT03-B28-23IA059-000320-B036-88http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae26.html 205.156.212.5 19970114201740 text/html 24822HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:14:48 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:25 GMTContent-length: 24635Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae26.html Sample Issue Copyright COMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS INT'L via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES MANX AND LOGANAIR TO RATIONALISE OPERATIONS (368 words) BRITISH MIDLAND EYES LONGER ROUTES; WILL ABANDON DC-9s (346 words) SCOTTISH REGIONAL AIRPORTS REEL FROM SEVERE WEATHER (436 words) TYROLEAN AIR CONVERTS FOKKER 70 OPTION TO ORDER, ADDS TWO OPTIONS (115 words) MD-95 PRODUCTION WILL NOT BEGIN FOR AT `AT LEAST A YEAR' (91 words) ICAO PREDICTS WORLD AIRLINE TRAFFIC UP 7% IN '95 (115 words) CITYFLYER EXPRESS PREPARES FOR FOURTH ATR-72 (93 words) INDUSTRY SIDELIGHTS -- AIRLINES (180 words) INDUSTRY SIDELIGHTS -- MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS (287 words) INDUSTRY SIDELIGHTS -- AIRPORTS (61 words) EUROPEAN AIRPORTS, AIRLINES PUT SPIN ON EU GROUND HANDLING DECISION (894 words) EU DELAYS FULL LIBERALIZATION OF GROUND HANDLING (130 words) CopyrightCOMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS INT'L via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996MANX AND LOGANAIR TO RATIONALISE OPERATIONS      Airlines of Britain Holdings -- owner of British MidlandAirways, Manx Airlines, Manx Airlines Europe and Loganair -- willrationalise the regional airline operations of the latter threecompanies following a decision by group Chairman Sir Michael Bishopshortly before Christmas. The move comes as Isle of Man-based commuteroperator Manx Airlines is expecting to see continued recovery in 1996after losses in 1994.       In an interview with C/R News International, Manx AirlinesCommercial Director Mike Bathgate said that since Loganair and ManxAirlines Europe both fly as British Airways Express franchisees, itmakes sense to rationalise operations with those of Manx Airlines.Effective 1 January, the three airlines' operations will be managed bya single Manx Airlines management team. Glasgow-based Loganair willcontinue to trade in its own name under the leadership of ManagingDirector Scott Grier.Job Losses at Loganair       Bathgate said there will "probably" be some Loganair job lossesin Scotland "on the accounting side," but this will depend on how manystaff relocate. He claimed that there will be no visible change tooperations, although rationalisation of routes and equipment will bedecided in the coming weeks ahead of the resumption of a summerschedule in the second quarter of 1996.      During 1994, Manx Airlines plunged into heavy losses of severalmillions of pounds following its takeover of much of the Loganairoperation. Manx increased in size by more than 80%, as 11 aircraft and40 routes were added. In 1995, the airline established its franchiseagreement with BA, which had begun under Scott Grier as he prepared tolead a Loganair management buyout from Airlines of Britain. That movesubsequently did not proceed, with Bishop instead retaining Loganairas a smaller element of the group.      Now the airline's fortunes have been reversed, says ManxManaging Director Terry Liddiard.  "In 1995 we have turned [the loss]round completely, and expect a healthy profit," he told a staff salesand marketing conference. Liddiard attributed the airline's improvedstatus to strict control of costs, revenue growth and the efforts ofManx's 850 staff. Goals set for 1996 include improved punctuality,better handling of customer complaints, and "the best planned servicerecovery in any situation."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS INT'L via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BRITISH MIDLAND EYES LONGER ROUTES; WILL ABANDON DC-9s      British Midland, with 100 flights daily from London Heathrow,is looking to extend the profits it has realized from successful code-sharing arrangements by starting new service that could make thecarrier a much larger force in Europe.British Midland Fleet Plans        11/95   4/97********************737-500  12      14 737-400   6       6737-300   5       5F100      4       4F70       2       5DC-9-10   1       0DC-9-30   3       0ATP       2       2J41       1       1*******************Source: British Midland    The airline, which code-shares with American Airlines, UnitedAirlines and Virgin Atlantic, is examining several new destinationsfrom Heathrow, including Rome, Madrid, Cairo, Warsaw and Budapest, anindustry source says. The longer-haul routes could be flown withexcess SAS aircraft, possibly even Boeing 767s. SAS owns 40% ofBritish Midland and already has subleased eight 737-500s to thecarrier.    The second-largest carrier in the U.K., British Midland also plansto eliminate three McDonnell Douglas DC-9s from its fleet during thenext 18 months as it adds new 737-500s and Fokker 70s.      The carrier now has a fleet of 36 aircraft, including 22 newer737s. By April 1996, it will get rid of its oldest aircraft, a DC-9-10that was the sixth DC-9 ever made, delivered in 1965. The aircraft isunder lease from Ansett Worldwide Aviation. By 1997, British Midlandplans to cast off three DC-30s leased by Electra Aviation. During thattime it will take delivery of additional 737s and F70s.     Once the DC-9s are gone, British Midland's fleet will have anaverage age of about four years. The carrier has used a strategy ofstarting up a route with smaller aircraft, such as a 737-500 or aFokker 70, and then switching to larger aircraft when the routebecomes more profitable.     British Midland recently began what it claims is the firstreservations booking service with payment made on the Internet. Thenew system, called CyberSeat, is aimed at the 50 million Internetusers, a figure British Midland says is growing 10% per month.CyberSeat still allows travel agent pickup for tickets.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS INT'L via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SCOTTISH REGIONAL AIRPORTS REEL FROM SEVERE WEATHER     The worst winter weather in years struck island airports off thenorth coast of Scotland late last month, closing some as a result ofcombined high wind, snow and ice. Severe conditions were aggravated byrecord low temperatures, although some regional services were expectedto resume 28 December to Shetland Island airport at Sumburgh after afour-day break. Sumburgh is the region's most important airport,supporting a series of inter-island operations, scheduled services tothe mainland and continuous flights connected with offshore energyshuttles.     Snow drifts as much as 30 feet deep were reported on Shetland, asgale force winds drove some of the worst blizzards seen on the island.Sumburgh Airport closed on Christmas Eve and even as scheduledoperations were due to resume late last week, more bad weather wasbeing forecast for the region. The cold conditions were felt farthersouth on the Scottish mainland with Glasgow reporting temperatures aslow as -18 degrees Centigrade and with nighttime temperatures set tofall as low as -22 C.    Loganair, which operates as British Airways Express, told C/R NewsInternational that along with being unable to fly to Sumburgh,operations to Lerwick were being interrupted by heavy snow. It alsohad to abandon a flight to Donegal, Ireland, because of bad weather,instead diverting at least one service to Londonderry.     Aberdeen-based Business Air told C/R News International that itsservices to Sumburgh via Inverness had also been hit by airportclosures and air traffic control delays, although services resumed 28December.     Highland and Islands Airports (HIA), which manages Sumburgh andInverness airports and the aerodromes at Benbecula, Islay, Kirkwall,Stornoway, Tiree and Wick, told C/R News International that all theregion's airports had been affected by the winter weather. Theprincipal problem has been ice rather than deep snow, although itreported up to 3 feet of snow on Sumburgh's airport ramps.     As much as an inch of solid ice has built up on runways at all ofthe island airports as melted snow has frozen. This has constituted amajor problem for Sumburgh, since the Shetland Isle airport reliesupon the delivery, by road, of de-icing agents from Lerwick; it wasstill cut off on 28 December. HIA reported that conditions were so badthat a fully loaded British Aerospace ATP flown by British Airwayscould not operate into Stornoway on the island of Harris in the OuterHebrides. With the threat of continuing severe conditions, HIAconcluded that the region's airports "could cope," but conceded thatthe "unusual ice problem" was the greatest factor influencingcontinued air connections to the mainland of Scotland.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS INT'L via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996TYROLEAN AIR CONVERTS FOKKER 70 OPTION TO ORDER, ADDS TWO OPTIONS    Tyrolean Airways picked up one of its three options on the Fokker70 and added two more options 22 December.

The EU's directive last month [see box at right] marks the end ofa long debate between airlines and airports over ground-handlingrights, for the time being at least. Monopolies on ground handlingservices are maintained by some European airports, while airlinesenjoy monopolies at other airports. There is limited and opencompetition at still other airports.    European airlines began lodging complaints against airportmonopolies with the EU as far back as 1991, and their actions wereresponsible in part for the formulation of recommendations for the EUdirective. The airlines' recommendations were more far-reaching intheir attempts to foster competition.    The EU's directive allows exemptions for airports that are eithertoo small or congested to immediately accommodate competition, anddelays until 2003 liberalization at many of Europe's largest airports.It also allows airports to charge a concessions fee to third-partyground handling companies.    The directive is a "substantial improvement" over earlierproposals, says Sheena Gibson, head of the European Policy Unit forAirports Council International - Europe (ACI). But the Association ofEuropean Airlines decried the EU's directive.    Le Thi Mai, general manager for environment and infrastructure atAEA, says it was not happy with the "watered down" directive. Theeight-year waiting period before complete liberalization of groundhandling services is too long, she says.    What concerns ACI is its conviction that the introduction ofthird-party competition for baggage and passenger handling, cateringand fueling services infringes upon the rights of privatized, self-financed airports to make important financial decisions about theirown operations. There seems little doubt that the proposal willnegatively affect the finances of some airports that rely heavily onground handling for revenue.    Le Thi Mai makes the case that the EU's protection of airportground handling monopolies until 2003 is a form of "regulatory" stateaid that undercuts the argument that these airports are truly privatized. The directive actually favors airport monopolies, AEAargues, which under certain circumstances will be allowed to existafter 2003. Monopolies enjoyed by airlines, however, will bedismantled under the directive, AEA contends.      AEA cites Olympic Airlines' monopoly at Athens Airport as anexample. Olympic will have to relinquish its monopoly before 1999 andcompete for ground-handling rights with other parties. Yet someairports, such as Frankfurt, will be able to retain their monopoliesuntil 2003. "I don't like monopolies held by airports or airlines," LeThi Mai explains. But if airports are allowed to maintain theircurrent monopolies, then airlines should also, she argues.    On the other hand, ACI feels the EU's proposal for "unlimited[airline] self-handling" will create new monopolies, the verysituation the EU is trying to prevent, says Gibson. Large airlines atsmaller airports will so dominate ground handling, that the EU'sdirective is tantamount to reducing competition, she explains. RobertPayne, Frankfurt Airport's spokesman, agrees. Larger airlines "arepositioned to leverage themselves and to have competitive advantageover other groups," he says. Space Constraints, Efficiency Drew Concern of Airports' Concern     ACI is also concerned about space constraints at airports --Frankfurt being the prime example -- where there is little or no roomto accommodate new competitors. The financial cost of creating thisextra space "would be horrendous," says Kelly, not to mention thepolitical cost from environmental protests against expansion.Frankfurt Airport may have to sacrifice some of its aircraft parkingspace in order to accommodate new ground handlers, Payne indicates.     Loss of aircraft parking space presents another issue: disruptionof airport operations. Payne says Frankfurt is "concerned about beingable to maintain [its] levels of efficiency and capacity," which hebelieves are optimized by having only one ramp handler. Frankfurt'sefforts to maintain a 45-minute maximum for traffic transferring atthe facility may be jeopardized by the new EU rules, as well. JacquesReder, spokesman for Aeroports de Paris, operator of Paris' two mainairports, says it would be "impossible" to accommodate more than thetwo handlers already at each airport because of ramp congestion.     Le Thi Mai questions why Frankfurt cannot achieve the efficiencyof an airport like Heathrow, where ground handling competition isliberalized. Frankfurt, however, is more space-constrained thanHeathrow.    Economies of scale will also be hurt by introducing newcompetitors, says Payne, who points out that Frankfurt has not raisedits ground handling fees for a number of years. Airports also face aloss of revenue if new companies are allowed to compete againstairport monopolies. Frankfurt accrues 38% of its revenue from groundhandling services, while Aeroports de Paris, operator of Parisairports, generates 19%. ADP spokesman Jacques Reder says introductionof a third ground handling company at either Orly or Charles de Gaullewill have a negative effect on ADP's revenue, all of which isreinvested in the airports.    AEA counters with financial assessments researched by anindependent university. Airline ground handling costs would be atleast 30% lower at airports that offer competitive ground handling,she says. These types of services cost European carriers between $2.3billion and $2.5 billion in 1991, she explains. Extrapolated, airlinescould have saved as much as $750 million that year under a moreliberalized environment.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMUTER/REGIONAL AIRLINE NEWS INT'L via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EU DELAYS FULL LIBERALIZATION OF GROUND HANDLING    A final document detailing the EU's directive has not yet beenformed, but in general advocates allowing European airlines to offertheir own self-handling services in order to lower the cost of airtravel to airlines and passengers. Specifically, the EU says:    *  airlines will be able to operate their own baggage handling by1999. Airlines involved in alliances, however, will be precluded fromhandling the baggage of other carriers unless they qualify as third-party handlers.    *  terminal and airside handling services will be open to thirdparty competition by 1 January, 1999, at airports that handle morethan 3 million passengers annually;    *   airports handling more than 3 million passengers annually canappeal for two-year exemptions in 1999 and 2001. There will be noextensions granted after 2003.Back to Headline List WT03-B28-24IA059-000320-B036-116http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae12.html 205.156.212.5 19970114201909 text/html 20448HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:17:20 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:16 GMTContent-length: 20261Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae12.html Sample Issue Copyright HELICOPTER NEWS via NewsNet January 5, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES DOWNSELECT LEAVES SH-2G AND LYNX TO COMPETE FOR RNZN HELO ORDER (347 words) ATLANTA CONTRACT AWARD SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK (379 words) V-22 EMD EFFORT ON COURSE FOR DECEMBER FIRST FLIGHT (439 words) NAVY COMPLETES MH-53, MAGIC LANTERN INSTALLATION (195 words) MARINE CORPS FORESEES OSPREY, JAST AND RPV MIX (221 words) HELO PROGRAMS UNLIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY AUTHORIZATION BILL VETO (176 words) HELICOPTER INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS TO WATCH IN 1996 (729 words) CopyrightHELICOPTER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996DOWNSELECT LEAVES SH-2G AND LYNX TO COMPETE FOR RNZN HELO ORDER    As expected, the results of the New Zealand Ministry of Defence'sdownselect leave Kaman Aerospace and Westland Helicopters to competefor the Royal New Zealand Navy's six-ship, $120-million helicopterprocurement.    Eliminated in the downselect were Sikorsky Aircraft and Eurocopter.    The competitors, informed of the result of the downselect lastmonth via a letter from the New Zealand Ministry of Defence, are tosubmit best and final offers in late February.    The outcome of the New Zealand downselect will likely extend beyondthe Royal New Zealand Navy's (RNZN) relatively small buy, because theRNZN is cooperating with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), which alsohas a requirement for medium helicopters. The result may alsoinfluence Malaysia's naval helicopter procurement.    The RAN plans to buy helicopters which can operate from its ANZAC-class frigates and the proposed Offshore Patrol Combatant (OPC). Therequest for tenders, issued in late October, calls for delivery of 14helicopters for the frigates, with the possibility of an additionalnine aircraft for the OPCs.    The value of the Australian contract is expected to be about $500million.                                                                                                                 Malaysia, which is jointly developing the OPCs with Australia, isexpected to buy at least six naval helicopters to replace its obsoleteWestland Wasps.    Sales efforts by both Sikorsky and Eurocopter were made moredifficult by factors not related to the performance of the aircraft onoffer.    Sikorsky's chances were widely seen to be diminished by problemsexperienced by the Australian army's 39-ship Black Hawk fleet, whichincluded airframe cracks, corrosion problems and a lack of spares.Sikorsky was reportedly offering a naval version of the S-76.    Eurocopter would have been a difficult choice in New Zealandbecause of opposition to the French government's ongoing nucleartesting in the region.    New Zealand will conduct a limited evaluation of the twocompetitors while best and final offers are being processed. Acontract award is scheduled for April, following parliamentaryapproval of the Defence Ministry's selection.

GTRI is acting as prime contractor on behalf of the FederalAviation Administration for the Atlanta Short Haul TransportationSystem (ASTS), a demonstration project aimed at validating the use ofhelicopter services in the Atlanta region during the Games.    A bidder's conference, held Dec. 7, drew responses from fiveoperators, sources tell Helicopter News. They are: Air Logistics,Petroleum Helicopters Inc., Evergreen, Era Aviation, and OmniFlight.    Operators are being asked to commit to carriage of between 1.6million and 1.9 million pounds of air freight during the 17-dayperiod. The Games begin on July 19.                                                                                      The freight--in the form of small overnight packages--is beingprovided by a consortium of carriers including UPS, Federal Expressand the U.S. Postal Service. The carriers--who have formed into acooperative group for ASTS--will be subsidized on a 90 percent returnbasis from the FAA for their participation in the project.    The object of the program is to establish feedback from theday-to-day business  operations "so we can show that helicopters makeeconomic sense in this type of environment," Stancil says. GRTI isundertaking a major analysis of ASTS operations to establish abaseline for "looking afresh" at helicopter transportation in an urbanenvironment.    During the package carrying operations the helicopters will use acommunications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) GPS/data link systemfor flight following, dispatch and weather information contributed byARNAV Systems Inc., for the project.    Of the five operators bidding, PHI recently signed up as a user ofsimilar equipment--ARNAV's System Six hardware. Whether this will givethe company an edge in the Atlanta competition is not clear.    Meanwhile, Stancil dismissed some industry grumbling about whatTextron's announcement that it has become a sponsor of the Olympicsmeans, and will bring 19 Bell helicopters to the Games. "We had plentyof warning this was happening, so we knew what to expect," Stancilsaid. Some of the Bell machines will be fitted with the ARNAVequipment "so they can, in effect, be part of the ASTS data collectioneffort," he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELICOPTER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996V-22 EMD EFFORT ON COURSE FOR DECEMBER FIRST FLIGHT    Current projections--backed up by actual parts flowing frompre-production processes--show that the V-22 Osprey is now weighingnearly 1,300 pounds under the empty weight figures specified in thecontract between the U.S. Navy and Bell Boeing, a 1995 year-end checkon progress shows.     "We have about 50 percent of the aircraft which is now 'actual'parts with known weights," says Stuart Dodge, Director of the JointProgram Office (JPO) in Washington, D.C. "They all conformed to ourpredictions. It shows we have the weight projections nailed down."    Dodge recently told JPO employees in a Christmas letter that theweight savings have exceeded--by over a factor of two--the targetweights set by the Bell Boeing manufacturing team themselves.    "It's directly related to the advanced production processes in use.Put simply, they minimize errors and guarantee first time results,"Dodge said in a follow-up interview with Helicopter News.    Dodge--who credits pioneering work done with the Boeing 777airliner with the production process success--says the first EMD(Engineering, Manufacturing and Development) Osprey fuselage wasrecently mated to its wing structure "with the tap of a rubbermallet."    This operation--which brought the Boeing Helicopters Div., fuselagetogether with wings manufactured by Bell Helicopter Textron inArlington, Texas,--represented an important milestone for the project.    "It qualified us to begin giving out advanced long-lead contractsto vendors for the first Osprey production equipment items," he said.    Go-ahead for the first, or low rate initial production (LRIP),parts will follow the first flight of this aircraft set for Decemberof this year. It will be the seventh V-22, but the first built toproduction-level specifications.    "Everything hangs on meeting that [first flight] commitment," Dodgesaid.    The stakes are high. With this flight complete, the government willformally begin the process of buying 523 V-22s it has contracted for(425 for the Marine Corps, 48 for the Navy and 50 for the SpecialOperations Command.)    First deliveries--to the Marines--are set for 1999, Dodge said.    Costs of the program show a similar story to the one on weight, hesaid, with the first EMD aircraft now exhibiting a "recurring flyaway"cost estimate of $32.5-million per aircraft. Dodge said this is ontrack to meeting its the target price goal of $29.4-million (in FY '94dollars.) A cost reduction program under assessment has the potentialof reducing this to $28.1 million.    Costs will also be affected by an expected decision sometime thisyear to buy Ospreys on an multi-year procurement (MYP) basis. The MYPis expected to call for producing three aircraft per month, whichcould reduce unit flyaway costs by as much as $3-million per aircraft,Dodge said.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELICOPTER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996NAVY COMPLETES MH-53, MAGIC LANTERN INSTALLATION    The Navy's Coastal Systems Command, Panama City, Fla., last monthcompleted installation and initial testing of the Magic Lanternshallow water mine detection system onboard a MH-53 helicopter.    The initial testing was successful, according to an industryofficial. Magic Lantern is built by Kaman Aerospace. Further testingof the MH-53/Magic Lantern will be conducted this summer.    Once operational, Magic Lantern will be installed on Naval ReserveSH-2G helicopters, based at Willow Grove, Pa. Kaman is working now onintegrating the system into the SH-2G, work which should be completedby June. Previously, the system was used on the "F" model H-2.    The Navy currently has two Magic Lantern systems and funding for athird is provided for in DoD's FY '96 appropriations.    Magic Lantern projects a blue-green laser into the water to locatetargets. The targets are recorded and sent back to the system for image and signal processing. An aided target recognizer (ATR),essentially an intensive set of processing algorithms, is applied tothe image to establish details of the target's identification.    The system was developed as an "in-house" research project atKaman, and an earlier version was deployed successfully during theGulf War.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELICOPTER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996MARINE CORPS FORESEES OSPREY, JAST AND RPV MIX    A U.S. Marine Corps concept for a future air/ground task forceforesees employment of nearly 200 V-22 Ospreys as the mainstay of theaviation element.    The infantry-carrying version--the MV-22--will account for 120 ofthe Ospreys. In addition, 36 will fly in the utility/observation role,and a further 36 in the "attack" role.    The plan, oriented well into the future, foresees thepackage--known as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)--operatingthe Ospreys alongside 140 Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST)V/STOL aircraft. The MAGTF would also be supported by 42 heavy lifthelicopters, as well as 30 multi-purpose remotely piloted vehicles(RPVs).    This outline--which introduces two significantly new variants ofthe V-22 into the planning process--is part of a new "alternatestructure" for the MAGTF being discussed in the new Sea Dragontechnology exploitation program announced by Marine Corps CommandantGen. Charles Krulak last month.    In that initiative, the Corps will also pursue a major effort tointroduce automated--unmanned--rotary-wing craft into its aviationstructure.    Col. Tony Wood, director of the Commandant's Warfighting Lab atQuantico, Va., challenged industry to fly a 6,000 pound payloadunmanned helicopter in tests scheduled for February 1997.    An outline of possible future force structure for the MAGTFsuggests that, in addition to the Ospreys, RPVs will play anincreasing role in resupply, observation and weapons targeting roles.Back to Headline List CopyrightHELICOPTER NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996HELO PROGRAMS UNLIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY AUTHORIZATION BILL VETO    Defense authorization conferees, after months of deadlock, wrappedup work on their FY '96 defense bill Dec. 13, but the measure wasvetoed by President Clinton, who objects to Congress providing DoDwith $7 billion above the administration's request.    Although the bill, which provides DoD with $264.7 billion in budgetauthority and $262.1 billion in outlays, will undergo revision beforeagain going to the White House, major DoD helicopter programs areunlikely to be affected by those revisions.

Naval Helicopter Procurements in Australia and New Zealand. The         focus in 1995 was attack helicopters in Europe. This year, the         most closely watched naval competitions will be in the Pacific         Rim. Again, the competition will include at least four airframes,         but only two have a real chance, the Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprite         and the Westland Super Lynx.2.       Introduction of the Bell Boeing Civil Tiltrotor. Expect the V-22         team to introduce an 11-place civil tiltrotor based on the XV-15         concept demonstrator design. Assuming Bell and Boeing can work         out the details, the announcement could come as early as Heli-         Expo '95 in February. But smart money is on the project being         revealed at NBAA in October.3.       Industry Consolidation. Everyone says its coming. But that's what         everybody said in 1995. The most likely scenario, nothing         changes. The second most likely scenario: a combination of Boeing         and McDonnell Douglas' helicopter units. If that fails, watch for         Sikorksy to join the fray.4.       Canadian Helicopter Buy. Another tight competition. Too early to         pick a front-runner, but the winning bid needs to be long on         creative financing.5.       Approval of the Marine Corps' 4BN/4BW Plan. Gen. Bob Magnus, the         Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Aviation says we should have         a thumbs up or down this summer on the Corps' $2 billion         Huey/Cobra modernization effort. 6.       First Flight of an EMD V-22. More importantly, look for a debate-         -and decision this summer--on accelerating production to 36         aircraft per year.7.       The Digitization of the U.S. Army's Helicopter Fleet. By the         Army's rules, the initial lot of aircraft must be completed by         mid-June for the Army's Force XXI trials.                           8.       British Training Helicopter. Will the British throw the Europeans         a bone, after buying American (the Apache and the C-130J) in         1995?

The strategy,which also would allow increased access to U.S. markets by foreigncarriers, is to be released next month after the state of the union speechand publication of the President's fiscal 1991 budget. In a speech to theTransportation Research Board in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, Skinner saidthe cost of shaping up the nation's transportation infrastructure over thenext 20 years could run from one to three trillion dollars and called for a"stonger, healthier partnership among federal, state and localgovernments."   Such a partnership would be strengthened, Skinner added, by replacing"rigid requirements with performance-related criteria in federaltransportation programs," including "additional regulatory flexibility andpolicies that recognize the diversity of conditions and needs in the realworld." Such a healthier partnership "goes hand-in-hand with reduceddependence on federal money. We believe federal recipients of federaltransportation aid should pay a larger share of project costs." Skinnersaid that increasing the ante for state and local governments will "helpbring the principles of market competition to bear in our financingprograms" and "also strengthen state and local accountability for wisetransportation decisions." He said the government would be seeking new andcreative ways to "apply the time-tested user-fee principle."   Directly from the users, Skinner said the government would seek torecover "the maximum practical share of costs they impose. This includesrecovering federal costs from user groups that are now getting a free ride.We also want to make it easier for other levels of government to levy userfees for transportation improvements." Such moves would allow localairport authorities to impose passenger facility charges (PFCs), or headtaxes, which is prohibited under current airport and airway fundinglegislation. Hike from 8% to at least 10% is anticipated for the airlinepassenger ticket tax as well as a four-cent increase in the levy on non-commercial aviation fuel.Copyright 1990 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightREGIONAL AVIATION WEEKLY via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1990   Vol. 5, NoAOPA WOULD DUMP GROUND-BASED ATC SYSTEM IN FAVOR OF SATELLITES   FAA should abandon its reliance on a ground-based air traffic controlsystem in favor of a satellite-based system using the growing GlobalPositioning Satellites (GPS) network, AOPA President John Baker urged thisweek. In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Bakercharged that the National Airspace System Plan, the government's multi-billion-dollar attempt to upgrade the National Airspace System, is behindschedule and over budget. The charge drew an immediate response from DOTSecretary Samuel Skinner, who called the U.S. ATC system "the safest in theworld." Conceding capacity problems due to demand exceeding supply,Skinner added, "all you have to do isgo to Europe to find out what I amtalking about." Propelling 1950s technology into 1990 technology is"time-consuming; it is state-of-the-art; it is expensive; and, it isdifficult...but I can assure you, that technology is right on target," hedeclared.   Baker said from original cost estimates of $11.4 billion in 1981, FAA isnow looking at a total cost of $25 billion to $27 billion to complete theNAS improvements and is 10 years behind the original implementationschedule. He called for a congressional investigation of the NAS Planeffort, adding that "it doesn't make sense to move forward in thatdirection (completing the current NAS Plan). We believe it's now time torecast this program and move to the system of the future."   Baker said a major portion of the GPS system, which was designed toprovide navigation and communication capabilities for use by the military,is already in place, noting that 14 of the satellites in the 24-satellitenetwork are already in orbit and "are working phenomenally well." He saidthat satellite network can provide guidance accurate enough for non-precision and Category I approaches at a much lower cost than continuingwith all the elements of the current NAS Plan. An AOPA report found the 90separate projects envisioned in the NAS Plan have now grown to 187 separateprojects. The report states that projects with an estimated cost of $7.14billion to $10.8 billion could be eliminated or sharply reduced becausethey will not be needed to implement or support a satellite-based controlsystem. Among the potential savings listed by AOPA are: $345 million forcontrol tower/TRACON modernization; $426 million for Air Route TrafficControl Center modernization; $196 million in facilities and equipmentexpenditures for the new Denver, Colo., airport and $111 million of plannedimprovements in ATC system facilities and equipment in the area aroundDallas/Fort Worth Airport to support actual and forecast traffic growth;$1.1 billion to implement the microwave landing system;over $1 billion forterminal radar digitizing, replacement and establishment; $108 million tosustain and relocate Automatic Surveillance Radar, and over $740 millionearmarked for long-range radar replacement and networking.Copyright 1990 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightREGIONAL AVIATION WEEKLY via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1990   Vol. 5, NoSTRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF FAIRCHILD AIRCRAFT CONTINUES   Dispute over control of Fairchild Aircraft Corp. appeared to have beensettled out of court late Thursday, although the outcome was unclear at RAWpresstime.

The TWExpress carrierwill not attempt toresume service. Carrier had been using eight of its owncommuter slots at New York Kennedy in addition to 11 air carrier slotsleased from TWA. The commuter slots will by acquired by TWA underprovisions of a bankruptcy reorganization plan approved last winter andwill be assigned to TWExpress carriers Metro Northeast and Jet Express. TWAalso is expected to assign its 11 jet slots to its remaining regionalpartners, at least temporarily.   Pocono, a unit of Dallas-based Phoenix Ventures, a corporate successorto Air Florida, lost $3.5 million last year and President Dann Lewis saidthe parent company had already loaned the carrier $5.5 million to offsetlosses and to meet other requirements. "Unfortunately, after an evaluationof operating performance and projections, it did not make a lot of sense tokeep the airline going," he added. The Avoca, Pa.-based carrier served 11airports in five states, operating with nine leased Metro III aircraft on90 scheduled daily flights. Destinations, In addition to New York Kennedy,were Albany and Binghamton, N.Y.; Boston; Harrisburg, Philadelphia andWilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pa.; Providence, R.I.; Washington's Dulles andNational airports, and Norfolk, Va. Approximately 200 jobs were affected.   Pocono filed for Chapter 11 protection and initially ceased operationsin mid-1988 when it lost its long-standing Allegheny Commuter relationshipwith USAir. Reorganization hit a snag when its major creditor,Northwestern Bank of Pennsylvania, feared that the proposed agreement withTWA would give the larger carrier a unilateral right to buy the eightKennedy slots at any time. Under the final agreement TWA was given theright to acquire the slots - Pocono's primary assets - only in case ofbreach of contract and "in such a way as to give rise to a right oftermination by TWA."   Lewis said the carrier's primary problem was its "very poor restrictiveagreement with TWA." He said the senior partner had approved overlappingmarkets for former Brockway Air Metro Northeast, a unit of Dallas-basedMetro Airlines and the the primary beneficiary of the Pocono shutdown.Metro is bringing in two additional Saab 340s, in addition to its existing10, and also expects to increase its fleet of 11 Beech 1900s to 13.

Acquisition by theFarmington, N.M., regional of nearly all Aspen Airways routes and stationsin the Rocky Mountain area is contingent upon its gaining the Unitedaffiliation (RAW, Dec. 29/470). Aspen owner Don Ringsby agreed to break uphis long-time regional carrier when he was unable to sell it as one unit;California investor Burt Sugarman dropped his offer in October after themanagement/employee/British Airways acquisition of United fell through.Ringsby plans to sell his 10 Convair 580s and jet operation, includingleases on four BAe 146-100s and an exclusive United Express route betweenDenver and Aspen, as separate units.   Mesa founder and President Larry Risley said he sees no resistance tothe new relationship on the part of United and no reason the transitioncannot begin in early February rather than March 1, as originally stated.By taking only the routes and stations, Risley is able to replace Aspen'saging fleet of 10 Convair 580s, of which seven fly the schedules whilethree are in reserve or maintenance, with a new fleet of 19- and 30-passenger airplanes. He plans a $50 million investment that will include11 Beech 1900s and four 30-passenger airplanes - either the EmbraerBrasilia or the Saab 340B with a 30-passenger configuration.   Risley, who also is chairman of the Regional Airline Association, saidhe has no intention of taking the United Express operation up to Part 121status, under which aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats arepermitted, in the immediate future. Over the long term, however, he saidhe is looking at the new 30-passenger-plus Dornier 328. To reach hisrequirement for 11 1900s by June 1, when he hopes to complete thetransition, Risley will retain five older 1900Bs that were going to betraded in on five new 1900Cs, the first of which has already beendelivered. Delivery of four new Brasilias or Saabs by June 1 is moreuncertain, and Risley said he may have to operate some used aircraft in theinterim.   Contrary to an earlier report, Risley is not seeking to place hisexisting Mesa Airlines structure under the United Express umbrella. TheNew Mexico and Arizona operation, which feeds the Albuquerque and Phoenixhubs, will remain an independent unit. Only those flights feeding Unitedat Denver will carry the United Express livery. "We have no plan to changethe existing Mesa structure." Nor, he added, is he interested in theseasonal Denver-Aspen ski market, which will be retained, at least for thetime being, by Aspen owner Ringsby.   There will be little difference between the management and supportstructures of Mesa and United Express, however. Flight crews will becross-utilized by both systems and all United Express aircraft will flowthrough the Mesa maintenance base at Farmington, which along with ColoradoSprings and Durango, Colo., are the three jointly served points. Mesahopes to hire up to 50 Aspen Convair pilots to help fill a requirement for90 additional pilots to operate the new system. Beech 1900 pay, however,will be half that of Convair pay, which is consistent with Aspen's currentAir Line Pilots Association contract for 19-passenger airplanes.   Ringsby has said there are several prospective buyers for the Aspen jetoperation, one of which is believed to be WestAir Holdings, the Fresno,Calif.-based United Express carrier thought to have been interested in theentire Aspen operation. WestAir has expanded to the East Coast, however,joining Air Wisconsin in feeding United's Washington Dulles hub (RAW, Dec.15/455).Copyright 1990 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightREGIONAL AVIATION WEEKLY via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1990   Vol. 5, NoDISCOVERY, OPPONENTS GET EXTRA ROUNDS FOR SQUABBLE OVER NEW HAWAII SERVICE   Opponents of Discovery Airways' planned intra-Hawaii service have madethe most of the extra rounds they have been given by DOT to attempt toprevent the new entrant's operations, firing away at Discovery overcitizenship issues. Meanwhile, Discovery, hoping to begin service Feb. 1,has taken delivery of its first BAe 146 aircraft and is responding to itsopponents. It claims Hawaiian and Aloha, in a kind of pre-emptivestrike, have been attempting to capture the market in advance ofDiscovery's entry. The incumbents have dropped fares 22% for passengerswho purchase coupons by Jan. 15. DOT has proposed to find Discovery fit,subject to several conditions (RAW, Dec. 29/474).   In filings at DOT, Aloha, Hawaiian, Air Line Pilots Association and theMachinists union said a hearing in the Discovery Airways proceeding that isconcerned solely with the issue of potential control of Discovery by PhilipHo is far too limited. Other citizenship issues should be addressed, theysaid, including Nansay Corporation's (a Japanese company) potential controlseparate from Ho; the role of Franco Mancassola, an Italian citizen, andthe terms of the agreements between Discovery and British Aerospace, thecarrier's sole equipment supplier. Aloha contended DOT's show cause orderproposing to grant Discovery a certificate before resolving all citizenshipissues is "contrary to more than five decades of precedent."    Hawaiian told DOT it recognized and shared the department's reluctanceto impede the free flow of capital across international boundaries, orfinancing which is a straightforward loan transaction not providing forforeign control. "However, it is abundantly clear that theNansay/Discovery relationship involves far more than a straightforward loantransaction," Hawaiian said.   ALPA said Ho's fiduciary obligations to Nansay Hawaii give Nansayimpermissible control over Discovery. Given that Ho's personal investmentin Discovery "is dwarfed by his employer's massive investment of up to $12million, there can be little doubt that he will vote his stock to protectNansay's interests in the applicant." The Machinists union filed similarcomments.   Discovery said none of the objectors had given valid reasons for furtherdelaying its application. Assertion of the opponents that DOT's orderproposing the fitness finding constitutes a radical departure from theagency's long-held position on foreign control "is wholly unfounded,"Discovery said. "In fact, the tight restrictions embodied in the orderwill surely discourage even the most passive foreign invesment in domesticair carriers." Discovery urged DOT immediately to grant oral authority toadvertise and promptly issue a final order so that operations may beginFeb. 1 as scheduled "on a sound financial basis."Copyright 1990 McGraw-Hill, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightREGIONAL AVIATION WEEKLY via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1990   Vol. 5, NoOREGON CONGRESSMAN SAYS MLS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IS NECESSARY   An Oregon congressman said the microwave landing system (MLS)demonstration program is needed to determine how best to operate aircraftin the future and that FAA erred in making a major policy announcement onthe system before an FAA/industry task force completes work on the program.Rep.

Echostar, headed by Chmn.-CEOCharles Ergen, also announced plans to take over Direct Bcstg.Satellite Corp. (DBSC) in return for cash or shares of Echostarstock valued at $9.7 million, subject to FCC and SEC approvals. Echostar already owned 40% of DBSC, which has FCC licenses to build2 DBS satellites with 22 channels.  Echostar has approval for 21DBS transponders.  DBSC recently received extension of itsconstruction permit until Nov. 30, 1998 (SW Dec 11 p6).  Echostarsaid it completed previously announced reorganization of operatingsubsidiaries Dec. 22.  Action followed exercise of virtually all ofwarrants to buy 3.7 million shares of Class A common, allowingsubsidiaries to become 100% owned instead of 95%, Echostar said.     DBSC Chmn.-CEO Harley Radin said his slot at 61.5 degrees W isexempt from new FCC "single spectrum cap" rule for DBS providers. Rule limits each company to single slot for full-continental U.S.service.  Radin said DBSC satellite can serve West Coast from itsassigned slot but elevation angles are lower there, meaning thatpotential for signal blockage from mountains or buildings isgreater.  That doesn't necessarily have adverse impact on businesscase for slot, he said, because "what you lose in the west you gainin the east."  In exempting 61.5 degrees slot from spectrum cap,FCC said that "while it appears that nationwide service from thatlocation is a technical possibility, as a practical matter suchservice would not be comparable to service from 101 degrees, 110degrees or 119 degrees" because of increased probability ofinterference in west.     DBSC will become Echostar subsidiary, although role of Radinin merged company hasn't been determined, Echostar spokeswomansaid.  Echostar had bought 40% of DBSC in 1994.  DBSC holds FCC DBSpermits to operate 11 channels at 61.5 degrees W and another 11 at175 degrees W, Radin said.  DBSC has contract with Lockheed-Martinto build 2 A2100 satellites, first scheduled for July 1997delivery, other year later, he said.  Each carries 32 transpondersof 115 w each and contains technology that can double transmissionpower to 230 w using 16 transponders.  Echostar has FCC permit tooperate 21 transponders at 119 degrees W.     Echostar-1 will carry first 65-70 channels for servicescheduled to go on line in Feb.-March, spokeswoman said.  Service,originally scheduled to be available in Sept., was delayed byinvestigation that followed explosion of Long March rocket in Jan.1995.  Echostar's Digital Sky Highway Network (DISH) is expected tobe in service by Feb. with 65 channels and another 65 added withlaunch of Echostar-2 in July-Sept.  In competing with DigitalSatellite Service (DSS), Primestar and AlphaStar, Echostar has saidit plans to focus on satellite dealers, while alliance with Philipsbrings Magnavox brand product to consumer electronics retailers. Although Echostar hasn't set pricing, it indicated in prospectusthat hardware would be priced around $500, with monthly programmingfee starting at $20.     While Echostar hasn't reported plans for international market,Radin said satellite at 61.5 degrees W potentially could supplyprogramming for Portugal, Spain and U.K. as well as Mexico, Latinand South America.  Any plans for international service willrequire FCC approval, which is reviewing Radin's request (and thoseof other operators) to provide international service from domesticslot.  Radin said that while Echostar hasn't made plans forinternational DBS, officials there "are enthusiastic for aninternational initiative."     Meanwhile, Thomson Consumer Electronics, RCA Digital SatelliteSystem manufacturer, said it didn't renew distribution contractwith Echostar Communications since latter plans to launch own DBSsystem to compete with DirecTV and USSB, which use DSS equipment. Thomson gave 4 of its remaining TVRO distributors expandedterritories:  Warren Companies, Sioux Falls, S.D., grows by 7states and Northern Cal.;  Consumer Satellite Service (CSS),Indianapolis, adds 3 states;  DSI, Urbandale, Ia., expands by 5states;  Earth Terminal, Bow, N.H., adds 4 states.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996DSS PRICING FOLLOWS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS TREND -- DOWN     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to dropand competition increases, entry-level product appears poised todip below $300.  Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) low-end RCA DSSsystem that started 1995 at $699, was being advertised by year-endat $499, and retailers said profit is in danger of drying up.  Tocombat falling prices, some retailers are focusing on step-up RCAand Sony DSS products that promise 20-25% profit margins, butslower sales.  Overall, 1995 sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS todealers were expected to top 1.5 million, while Primestar reportedclose to million subscribers.     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  Lower retail prices areexpected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba and Uniden enter DSSrace, with Uniden already indicating it may price product in$499-$549 range.  Alphastar and Echostar also are planning tointroduce own services -- latter partnering with Philips to bringMagnavox product to retail.  Even Primestar, which primarily hasleased equipment to consumers, has tested sales through group cableoperator TCI.     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCAand GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has beenadvertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony model, whichoriginally had $749 suggested price tag, was featured in Wiz ad at$648.     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze suppliers, whichhave said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones wherehardware is offered virtually free and profits are made on service. Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostar hasn't formallyreleased pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardwareretails could hit $500, with programming at $20.     Alphastar has said it will avoid selling own brand at retail,relying instead on combination of Amway, satellite distributors andmultilevel marketing.  Company signed agreement with SamsungElectromechanics in Aug. to build integrated receiver decoders(IRDs) and said it's seeking similar agreement with 2nd supplier. Samsung and 2nd supplier are expected to sell branded product to CEdealers.  "I would think that for this product the equipment wouldpass the cost curve much more rapidly than the marketing cost ofattracting a subscriber," said Alphastar Pres.-CEO MurrayKlippenstein, whose company plans to launch 120-channel service in1996 first quarter with hardware packages at $600-$700.  "When thathappens, it makes sense to give the box away because the long-termvalue is in the subscription."     With so many satellite systems to choose from, future hingeson manufacturers' ability differentiate products.  Many retailershave said they won't give category same amount of shelf space asother products such as VCRs, meaning that suppliers will bebattling for every square inch.  "When you can't [telldifferences], you end up dealing with a price issue and end up with$499 satellite systems," Tops Appliance City Senior Vp-Gen. Mdse.Mgr. Rick Jones said.  Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996ALPHASTAR SETS PLANS FOR NEW SATELLITE SERVICE     AlphaStar will launch medium-power satellite service late infirst quarter priced at $600-$700 for hardware, with sales limitedto distributors and direct marketers, Pres.-CEO Murray Klippensteinsaid.  Company will sell single integrated receiver decoder (IRD)with 30" dish and remote control to dealers through distributorO'Rourke Bros. and to consumers through Amway and multilevelmarketer United Digital Bcstg. Corp.  Programming will be sold inpackages at $24-$49 monthly, with some offering 40 video and 30audio channels.  Premium pay packages and a la carte channels willretail at $4.95-$14.95 per month, with 16 PPV channels at $2.99 permovie.     Full 120-channel service, to be available 2-3 weeks afterlaunch, will consist of 85 video, 30 audio and 3-5 data services. IRD contains RS232 port to connect with PC to download dataservices and access Internet, Klippenstein said.  IRD also will useMPEG-2 data transmission and have LED.     To gain entry to consumer electronics retail, AlphaStar saidit's negotiating with several manufacturers to build product forsale under own brand name.  First such accord was signed withSamsung early in 1995 and it expects product to be available latein 1996 first quarter, Klippenstein said.  "We're targetingspecific customer bases rather than going with a mass marketapproach that requires huge inputs of advertising, media andconsumer electronics distribution," Klippenstein said.     Although $600-$700 is above AlphaStar's original target of$500, Klippenstein said retail would drop $100 per year.  He saidAlphaStar service will break even with sales of 500,000 units,estimated to be 12-18 months after launch.  Service is in firstround of beta test consisting of 300-400 units in Canada and isexpected to enter U.S. with another 400 in Jan., Klippenstein said. Second beta test will use uplink center in Oxford, Conn., he said.     AlphaStar is in "serious discussions" with several possibleinvestors, Klippenstein said.  Potential partners would buy equity,although he would identify them only as in "broad genre oftelecommunications."  AlphaStar also recently cut stock offering to2.1 million shares from 4 million, reducing amount expected to beraised to $37 million from $51 million.     AlphaStar first will provide service using AT&T Telstar 402Rwith 32 Ku-band 60-w transponders, launched Sept. 23.  By mid-1977,it will switch to Telstar 5 100-w satellite, where it will lease 16Ku-band transponders.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CLINTON VETOES DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION INCLUDING SPACE SYSTEMSFUNDING     President Clinton last week vetoed FY 1996 DefenseAuthorization bill that would have included hundreds of million ofdollars for new satellite systems and space technology.  He said hevetoed bill because it included $450 million for new ballisticmissile defense system that would have included space-based elementfor deployment by 2003.  Congressional Democrats had argued thatsystem would violate Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with formerSoviet Union, and Clinton said it was costly and unnecessary toprotect U.S. from long-range missiles in that way.  Republicanssaid treaty is outdated product of Cold War and said severalcountries in addition to Russia are developing nuclear weaponscapable of reaching U.S.  Democrats said they don't have seriousobjections to other space aspects of bill and it's likely thatauthorization for those programs would remain virtually unchangedin any future legislation.     Included in vetoed bill was major cutback in spending for U.S.spy satellite program.  Although Congress had earmarked $28 billionfor intelligence activities this year, National ReconnaissanceOffice (NRO), supersecret agency that oversees spy satellites,wouldn't have gotten its usual share.  Congress, upset overrevelations last year that office was building secret new facilityin Va. for $302 million and that it had carried over $1.2 billionin leftover money from previous year's budget, cut more than $1billion from NRO's $9 billion authorization.  Most of that moneyhas been transferred to Pentagon's general budget.     Cuts in reconnaissance budget didn't come as surprise andprobably would be supported by Democrats, who have backed reducedspending for other civil space programs, including NASA's satelliteoperations.  Lawmakers including Rep. Castle (R-Del.), HouseIntelligence Committee member, had indicated during authorizationdiscussions earlier in year that tightening budgets would mean spysatellite programs probably would have to go way of NASA -- towardsmaller, cheaper spacecraft and less expensive launch providers. Castle in Sept. said govt. also would have to start using morecommercially developed technologies where appropriate.  Ifcost-saving measures aren't taken, he said, "we will be faced withtruly unpalatable choices," including devoting greater percentageof intelligence budget to satellites or forgoing or eliminating"much-needed" satellite capabilities to fund other programs.     Also in authorization legislation was $30 million for newantisatellite program that would have resulted in production of 10missiles over next 4 years with capability of shooting down enemyintelligence satellites in low-earth orbit.  Another $250 millionwould have been authorized for deployment of Space & MissilesTracking System, with full satellite constellation deployment by2003.  Although it would have played role in BMD project, thissystem also would have been used to track U.S. and allied launchersand spacecraft.     In area of GPS, authorization bill would have required DefenseSecretary William Perry to turn off selective availability (SA)signals by May 1 unless he submits to Congress plans for:  (1) Newway to deny enemies ability to use GPS for military purposeswithout denying U.S. civil and military users access to signal. (2) Development of new receivers and other techniques for weaponsand weapons systems that would provide "substantially improved"resistance to jamming and other forms of electronic interference. Effect of SA turn-off would have been minimal on commercial userssince most already use differential GPS, which is more accuratethan GPS with or without selective availability.  Ann Ciganer,exec. dir.-policy, GPS Industry Council, said aim of Congressactually was to "send a strong message" that Defense Dept. needs todevelop electronic countermeasures to prohibit hostile powers fromusing GPS against U.S. interests.     Meanwhile, more than dozen military and commercial satellites,including some that recently have been repositioned over Bosnia,now are providing communications, weather and navigation for U.S.and other troops in region, Pentagon said.  Spokesman said mostimportant will be earth imaging applications, provided by SpotImage and others, and GPS technology that will help pilots ofmilitary cargo planes and warplanes as well as individual troopsequipped with positioning handsets.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996IMPROVED THRUST-TO-WEIGHT RATIOS AMONG BIGGEST CHALLENGES FORREUSABLE ROCKETS     Need to improve thrust-to-weight (F/W) ratios of rocketengines 30% or more (to 75) for reusable launch vehicles (RLVs)"presents developers with a difficult challenge," National ResearchCouncil (NRC) told NASA in report on agency's 3-phase program todevelop RLVs.  Launch costs for commercial satellites and otherpayloads could be significantly reduced with RLVs.  Another bigchallenge for RLV developers, NRC said, is producing vehicle frommaterials that will allow 90% of rocket's mass at launch to befuel.  Moreover, it said, "achieving orbit with the requiredpayload is only part of the challenge that has been undertaken bythe NASA/industry RLV program.  The other, equally important,challenge is to demonstrate a system that is capable of achievinga lower cost per launch and be clearly competitive with otherlaunchers worldwide."  To do that, report said, newly developedengines, primary vehicle structures, thermal protection systems andcryogenic tanks must be demonstrated to be "reusable with minimalinspections or replacements for at least 20 missions and have alifetime of at least 100 missions."     Current reusable engines including Space Shuttle Main Engine(SSME) and Russian RD-120 don't generate sufficient F/W ratios forRLVs, NRC said, so participants in program will have to increaseperformance of those engines or develop new ones.  "Developments toachieve this [30%-plus] increase have been identified bycontractors;  however, the committee believes that achievinggreater than 75 F/W will be very difficult, even with a totally newengine.  Upgrading an existing engine to meet this challenge,although less costly than developing a new engine, will be evenmore difficult," report said.     As for primary vehicle structure, NRC panel said it's"concerned about the low, 15 percent maximum weight-growth marginbeing applied this early in the development phase of a new designusing materials of moderate maturity."  It said 20 to 25% weightgrowth is typical in early stage of design development.  "The needto control weight growth tightly this early in the program placesa premium on accurate calculation of structural performance andweight and on early verification that the structure can be built ator below predicted weight," study said.  Otherwise, it said,approach to develop structures undertaken by industry proponents --Lockheed Martin, McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, and Rockwell -- is"sound."     Requirement for thermal protection system (TPS) that's aseffective as space shuttle's but has capability of withstandingimpact of space debris, is waterproof and can be removed (shuttle'sis glued in place) also was addressed.  "There are questions aboutthe resistance of tiles (refractory or metallic) to particle impactat liftoff and landing and especially while in orbit at spacestation altitude, where some predictions are that penetration of atank may occur at least once in a 100-mission cycle."  Level ofrain that safely can penetrate TPS also needs to be determined, itsaid:  "It is clear that both the shuttle-improved and metallicTPSs have significant higher resistance [to water], but neither hasbeen totally quantified across the operational map."  Waterproofingissues "must be resolved," it said, because "the time and manpowerrequired to apply waterproofing after each shuttle flight do notmeet the requirements for the turnaround times required for anRLV."     NRC said development program for cryogenic tanks is "robust"because multiple approaches are being developed.  It said 2aluminum-lithium alloys (Reynolds alloy 2195 and Russian alloy1460) are being examined as well as 3 fabrication techniques(machining to net-shape extrusion, net-shape spin forming, net-rollforging) and 2 welding techniques (standard and friction-stir).  Itsaid Russian alloy is 25% above specifications but needs to betested because it's new.  Reynolds alloy "exhibits better cryogenicductility" and strength than previously used materials but isdifficult to produce consistently.  Friction-stir welding technique"seems to be a promising solution to the problem of weldingaluminum-lithium alloys," report said, but needs to be tested more,especially on thin sheets such as those to be used for liquidoxygen tanks.     NASA and industry have adopted "reasonable approaches toadvance the state of the art in both space materials andpropulsion" in first phase of program, NRC said.  Phase II, whichentails construction of subscale flight model, is set to begin atend of 1996.  NRC said that before then, other important issuesneed to be addressed, including:  (1) Various aspects of propulsionsystem such as plumbing, leak sensors, valves, purge systems, etc. (2) Integrated health monitoring system for all components and newtechnologies.  (3) Ground support equipment for propulsion system. (4) Launch and landing sites, which it said require "considerablemore attention because of technical constraints imposed by variousorbits."Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996     Craig Chambers, former Group W Satellite Communications gen.

In the last 18 months, at least seven space-related companieshave joined the list of publicly traded firms providing the public andbig investment funds with much broader options in space investmentthan ever before.     Big publicly traded companies, and especially large aerospace anddefense firms, saw large increases in stock values in 1995, accordingto the Standard & Poor's (S&P) Index Services Group. As of Dec. 31,the S&P 500 Index of the largest companies showed an increase of 34percent in stock value during the year. Another index, the S&P 400,tracks stocks of companies with capitalization in the mid-range,generally less than $1 billion. Those stocks rose 29 percent in 1995(see chart on page 4).      For aerospace and defense firms in the 500 list, stock valueswere up an average of 62 percent, while the same category in the 400list was up 37 percent, according to an analyst at S&P. Breaking thegenre down further, defense electronics firms on the 500 list shot upin value by 96 percent in 1995. Telecommunications, by comparison,increased 32 percent in the 500 category, which includes only threecompanies: AT&T, MCI and Sprint.     Joe Shammas, an S&P analyst, says despite fluctuations in thevalue of most space-related stocks in 1995, the satellite segmentappears to be booming and headed for growth.      Companies like Globalstar, Orion, PanAmSat, Echostar and Spacehabwent public in 1995, and have shown mixed results in the interveningmonths. In addition, companies like American Mobile Satellite Co. andOrbital Sciences Corp. that already were public provided more evidencethat investing in space ventures can be a sound strategy.     Tom Watts, an associate director at New York investment bankBear, Stearns & Co. Inc., says that while the performance of spacestocks may not match the averages of the largest public firms,"overall, their potential for growth is greater than the overalleconomy." Satellite investments need to be viewed differently sincethey are closer to "public venture capital" than mainstream stocks, hesays.      "Our point of view is that prior to the launch of the satellite,there is very little good news that can come out [about a company'sprogress], and bad news tends to set the price back," Watts says. Oncea launch date approaches, the company can show that it is reducingbusiness risk and the stock price appreciates.     AMSC is one example. Its price was at about $12.50-$13.50 a sharein early last January, with a satellite launch in March. By lateDecember, the stock was trading at nearly $30 a share, despitetechnical problems with the satellite.  ...Successful Launch Raises Stock Price     Echostar and PanAmSat are in the same category. Echostar saw itsstock appreciate after the successful launch of another company'ssatellite, the Asiasat 2, on the Chinese Long March that Echostarplanned to use. After Asiasat was successfully boosted into space inlate November, Echostar stock rose from about $14 a share to more than$17. Then in late December, Echostar's own satellite was launched andits price rose to more than $24.     PanAmSat plans to launch its PAS 3R satellite on an Ariane rocketnext month, which will allow the company to enter the highlycompetitive business of providing Direct to Home satellite televisionservice in Latin America in a few months. The Jan. 9 launch will bethe first for PanAmSat since it went public. The stock initially soldfor $17 a share and last week was trading for around $22.      By year's end, Globalstar stock had recovered nicely from a sharpdip in its mid-year price. The stock was issued at $20 a share, thenplunged to about $12 but by late December was trading at more than$30. Since Globalstar is still far from launch, no clear explanationexists for why the price climbed back up.  Watts of Bear, Stearns saysinvestors decided not to rush to purchase Globalstar after it finishedthe initial offering. The price then fell and investors changed theirminds as they worried that they'd miss out on buying shares at a lowprice.  ...Catching A Rising Star     Another stock to watch is Tee-Comm, an electronics company basedin Canada that is behind the Alphastar direct-to-home satellitetelevision proposal and the Expressview DTH venture there. Tee-Comm'sstock traded at a little more than $3 a share earlier in 1995, and byyear's end was over $10. With service to begin in January, Wattsexpects the value to grow more this year.     High yield bond offerings by the satellite industry did not fareas well in 1995 with three offerings pulled from the market becausethe firms could not obtain the desired terms from investors. OrionNetwork Systems, Iridium and Globalstar were forced to rethink theirfinancing strategies after withdrawing junk bond deals that would haveraised nearly $1 billion in total.      Besides the public market, SpaceVest, a private investment fundthat specializes in space projects, also saw growth in its resourcepool in 1995.       John Higgenbotham, SpaceVest president, says SpaceVest addedBarclay's Bank to its fund in a second round of financing that raisedthe total fund from $41 million to $46 million. Higgenbotham saysSpaceVest invested in six companies in 1995 and will be involved inanother six to eight deals by about the third quarter of 1996 beforetrying to raise money for another investment fund.     While 1995 saw unprecedented levels of public investment insatellite firms, the year ahead could be even busier.       Wolfgang Demisch, managing director of equity research at BankersTrust Securities, says 1996 will be another highly active year forsatellite financing, with operations starting for several ventures,including direct broadcast service Echostar. The first launch formobile telephone venture, Iridium Inc., is another event the marketwill be watching. The initial public offering for U.S. SatelliteBroadcasting, expected shortly, also will be important, he says.     "The USSB IPO will set an independent equity valuation for apurely space-based broadcasting business," Demisch says. The successof the USSB stock sale will demonstrate how the market values Hughes'sinvestment in DirecTV and set the tone for other projects: "The marketwill recognize there is a tremendous new opportunity, although it isstill in the new stages."Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996SPACEHAB GOES PUBLIC; REVEALS PROFIT STREAM FOR '93-95     Spacehab, a commercial space firm that went public Dec. 21, hasbeen posting sizable profit and income figures for the last threeyears, according to its Dec. 20 prospectus.     Spacehab has been posting net income levels of $4-$16 million onrevenues of about $45 million a year, contradicting the belief amongsome that non-satellite-related commercial space activities have ahard time making money.     Spacehab's public offering raised about $45 million on the saleof 3.75 million shares of common stock at $12 per share. The companyreceived slightly more than $40 million after deducting the cost ofraising the money. The stock closed at 12 1/8 on Jan. 2.     The company, founded in 1984, owns and operates pressurizedmodules that fly in the back of space shuttles to provide additionalroom for experiments, equipment and crew. NASA has been virtually itsonly customer, and the company has been able to withstand difficultiesthat have included frequent shifts in government commercial spacepolicy, the delays associated with the space shuttle accident in 1986and special demands from investors to obtain insurance in case thegovernment reneged on its contracts. In addition, the market for usersof Spacehab services outside those sponsored by NASA has failed todevelop, in part because many potential customers can get free flightsfrom NASA.      Spacehab has survived by winning two NASA contracts, a $184.2million fixed price contract awarded in 1990 to lease 200 lockers onfive space shuttle flights in a Spacehab module and a $54 millioncontract awarded in mid-1995 to lease modules on four more shuttleflights beginning in 1996. Of the sales, Spacehab had collected $174million in payments from NASA by September 1995.     Most of the company's revenues came in 1993-95, when Spacehabtook in $42 million, $44 million and $46 million, respectively. Thecompany posted gross profits of $19 million, $20 million and $23million, respectively, in those years, with net income of $4 million,$9 million and $16 million, respectively.  ...Small Staff, Low Overhead     To develop the Spacehab single module, the company spent $120million, a company official says. The firm has remained tiny, withonly 14 employees, and contracts out much of its hardware andprocessing jobs to larger companies. The small size has allowedSpacehab's overhead to remain low.     The $40.3 million in funds available from the public offeringwill be applied in several ways, including $12 million to build a newdouble version of the Spacehab module needed to fulfill the latestNASA contract, when Spacehab will be used on shuttle flights to theRussian Mir space station. The three Spacehab missions to date haveused a single module. Fifteen percent of the money is to be used topay creditors on a loan.     Additional funds will be used to develop logistics equipment thatcould be used to bid for work associated with Space Station Alpha,expand the firm's payload processing facility and $1 million for theacquisition of complementary businesses or facilities. Another $11million is allocated to unspecified research and development andworking capital.     The prospectus describes several potential business areas thatSpacehab may expand into, either through acquisitions or investment.Spacehab has close ties with NASA's Centers for the CommercialDevelopment of Space (CCDS), since several of the centers have usedSpacehab lockers for NASA-sponsored experiments. The CCDSs are NASA-sponsored consortia involving universities and companies that performcommercial space research. The centers are working to develop newdrugs and materials that could become profitable space-relatedproducts in the next few years and the prospectus lists eightpotential commercial products that could emerge from the researchflown so far.     "The company intends to implement its Spacehab incubator programin order to evaluate, sponsor and invest in a portfolio ofcommercially focused, promising microgravity research and developmentactivities," the prospectus says. The incubator is a new Spacehabprogram to invest in commercially funded research.     Spacehab could subsidize the flight of experiments by othercompanies or organizations in return for equity participation,royalties or other rights in the new ventures, the prospectus says.The CCDSs, however, generally are given free access to space shuttleunder previous arrangements with NASA. As products being developed bythe CCDSs mature toward the point when they will produce revenues,NASA officials are trying to determine when to begin charging forspace flights. NASA's policy on charging commercial materialprocessing customers for space shuttle or space station access isundecided.  ...Space Station Opportunities Exist, But So Does Competition     Spacehab officials also hope to win contracts in the spacestation era, when the company's equipment could be used for logisticssupport or to conduct experiments prior to flying them on spacestation. NASA spends $300 million a year on space shuttle payloadprocessing, and Spacehab intends to pursue a portion of that market.     But strong competition will come from several other firms withmore resources and experience, the prospectus notes. For space stationlogistics support, Spacehab will be competing with foreign partners inthe program, in particular, Italy and Russia. Italy has agreed toprovide two pressurized modules to the program for logistics, whileRussia is offering the Progress logistics module. For payloadprocessing, McDonnell Douglas already is responsible for much of thework, and the United Space Alliance, a venture involving RockwellInternational and Lockheed Martin, may be assigned payload processingcapabilities as part of the sole source contract NASA intends to awardit for space shuttle operations.  ...Seeking Non-NASA Customers     Spacehab also will attempt to find customers outside NASA tolease locker space on its modules, although the company has had almostno success in this regard in the previous six years. Intospace GmbH, aEuropean venture, has the right to sell Spacehab services in Europeand China through 1999, while Mitsubishi has rights to sell them inJapan until 2004.     The total equity in Spacehab consists of 10.8 million shares, ofwhich 3.7 million were put on the public market and 7 million arerestricted, subject to limits before they can be publicly traded. Thepercentage of the company sold through the initial public offering was34.7 percent, a company official says.       After redistribution of equity from the public offering, Spacehabis 20 percent owned by its officers and directors. Of that, SpacehabBoard Chairman Shelley Harrison owns 8.5 percent; Director Shi Huangowns 8 percent. Harrison is an inventor of bar code scanners and holdsfour patents on the technology;  Huang is based in Taiwan and headsthe investment group there. Subcontractors McDonnell Douglas (2.7percent), Alenia Spazio (3.1 percent) and Mitsubishi Corp. (7.3percent) also are major stockholders. Poly Ventures, L.P., a firm thatHarrison is a managing general partner of, owns 7.8 percent; SpacehabTaiwan, Inc. has 7.3 percent; and Walter P. Kistler has 4 percent.

While buyers have more to choose from than ever before amongsmall satellite products, manufacturers face a competitive marketplacethat is producing orders more slowly than predicted. In 1996, smallsatellite builders must cope with an environment where supply exceedsdemand and industry growth is restrained by the lack of cheap,reliable launchers.      Does the industry have more capacity than demand? Buildersdisagree.     W. David Thompson, president of Spectrum Astro, says no. "We willsee the continuation and acceleration of the trend toward smallersatellites. It's the only solution with the economic situation mostcustomers have, both government and commercial.  NASA has done atremendous turnaround in its programs... Agencies like NASA used tospend $1 billion on a program, but now they're trying to take that $1billion and break it into 20 segments of $50 million each" with manysmall science projects as a result, he says. "There are moreopportunities for small satellite suppliers, not less."     Ed Nicastri, Orbital Sciences Corp. small satellite division vicepresident, says that when he looks at the demand vs. supply, he asks,"Why is everybody fighting to get into the business?" Both executivespraised NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin's support of smallsatellites. Nicastri expects a steady stream of new NASA contracts forsmall satellites based on programs that have started in the last twoyears such as New Millenium, the Student Explorers and the SmallExplorers. Defense Department small satellite use continues to belimited to experimental missions, but Nicastri, who used to overseesmall satellite projects at the military's Advanced Research ProjectsAgency, believes that military users are waking up to the applicationof small satellites for operational missions like weather imaging.     For example, Torrey Science & Technology Corp. was selected inlate December to receive Technology Reinvestment Program funding fromthe Pentagon to demonstrate a prototype small satellite for secure,mobile voice and data communications between handheld terminals. OSChas been selected as the satellite supplier, although no contract hadbeen awarded yet.      Meanwhile, the builders are working to differentiate themselves.     "Everybody has their niche. I am frustrated that we have not beenable to start more programs" that would generate more small satelliteorders across the industry, Rick Fleeter, president of AeroAstro, asmall satellite builder based in Virginia, says.       For example, the NASA-sponsored Student Explorer DemonstrationInitiative (STEDI) program run by the University Space ResearchAssociates was originally to pay for two to four cheap missions eachyear. But the program has been under way for two years and only twosatellites have been started, so the annual rate is much less thanhoped for, Fleeter says. STEDI is done on a shoestring budget, with$4.3 million allocated for an entire satellite and one year ofoperations.  The bus may cost only $1.2 million, which rules manyexpensive small satellite designs.     One reason STEDI has been slow to start is that the U.S.government has refused so far to let the Student Explorers use lowcost converted U.S. missiles as launchers, putting the satellites onPegasus rockets instead. The higher cost of the launchers has eateninto the program funding, sources say. However, program managers hopeto get a small amount of NASA funding, some $3 million, in 1996 tofund the start of a third mission and get competition going foranother round of inexpensive student satellites.     Other expected orders, like some of the commercial communicationssatellites for global mobile services, have not materialized whenexpected, Fleeter adds.  ...Intense Competition in '96     George Sebestyen, CTA Space Systems president, expects "wide-ranging, cut throat competition" for new orders in 1996. He expectsthe Air Force to start about three efforts in the small experimentalclass of satellite known as Space Test Experiments Platform, anotherone or two classified projects, one or two new NASA orders, pluspossibly commercial orders once the Federal Communications Commissioncompletes some communications satellite licensing procedures.     The poor track record of the small launch industry is damagingthe small satellite business indirectly, Sebestyen says. "Everybody isscared witless about any launch vehicle, no matter who makes it," hesays. "We need low cost launch vehicles. There's no point in buildingsmall satellites without a low cost launch vehicle."     Sales have not dropped noticeably as a result of the failuresyet, but delays in launch schedules have left satellites stacked upwaiting for launch, that in turn delay the start of other newprograms. "The biggest impact is that nothing goes up. It's verydiscouraging," he says.  ...Can Big Companies Make Small Satellites?     Although small satellites have been around since the start of thespace age, the business began to evolve into its current shape in themid-1980s when a few entrepreneurs began to challenge the notion thatsatellites had to be big and cost a small fortune. The David vs.Goliath mentality is still around, and with the overall shrinkage ofthe space business, the small satellite programs are attracting moreand more large companies, says Jill Stern, a Washington attorney whohas been involved in the small satellite business.     "My question is whether the [big companies] can preserve theefficiencies that attracted people to small satellites in the firstplace," Stern asks.     Thompson says the emphasis on small satellites is straining theability of all the companies to staff the programs, creating a newproblem industry wide.  "Even the biggest companies historically havehad only two to three satellite design teams, which used to besurrounded with 500 people each. Now the small satellite projectssupport only 30 or so people on each team, and the companies need sixor seven design teams. Even the largest companies don't have that kindof expertise around," he says. "You can't stand to have any loafers[on a small satellite project]. You can't stand to have anyone on theteam who doesn't contribute to the program. Everyone is scrambling [ascompanies recruit] to get the top 20 percent of the people on theircompany team."     But Thompson says the intense pressure to get rid ofnonproductive workers who inflate program costs is the reason the U.S.space industry is turning itself around in a matter of years, unlikeforeign competitors whose industrial practices "move as slow asmolasses."     The biggest problem for small satellite builders is theirattitude toward the market, Stern says. "Most of them are waiting forsomeone to give them a contract. They will have to become serviceproviders or form alliances with companies that do marketing orprovide voice and data services" if the suppliers want to see theirbusiness grow, she says.       Several of the builders, notably TRW and Orbital Sciences Corp.,already have done so and received manufacturing contracts as a result.      "Often in this business, the best opportunity is in going outand creating the need for your product...The guys who will succeed,who will stay alive, are not waiting for someone to anoint them,"Nicastri says.     At least six U.S. companies have been successful in developingsmall satellite businesses in the last few years, and competition iscoming from Russia and Europe. By the end of January, a team of Frenchsatellite manufacturers will be awarded a contract to build six smallsatellites with options for more for Starsys Global Positioning Inc.,industry sources say.  Alcatel Espace would serve as prime contractorfor the payload and integration, and Matra Marconi as subcontractorfor the satellite bus. Starsys, owned 80 percent by GE Americom and 20percent by French investors, holds a U.S. license to deploy a lowEarth orbit constellation of data messaging satellites.Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996IN BRIEF     *  Where's the next Pegasus launch?

However, its future lifeblood is heavilydependent on launching of government payloads."    Titled, "An Economic Perspective on the Future Commercializationof Space," report was written by Henry Hertzfeld and Frank Baradinoof Gellman Research Assoc., Pittsburgh, for National Chamber ofCommerce Foundation.  Hertzfeld told us study was "an examination ofthe economic framework for realizing space ventures" (see separatestory this issue).    Fearing market shakeout, officials of 3 major launch companies-- General Dynamics (GD), Martin Marietta (MM) and McDonnell Douglas(MD),  -- already are reviewing study.  Art Conroy, MD commercialspace market analyst, said, "There are lots of doubts whether demandwill equal capacity" over next 5 years because number of competingU.S. and foreign launch companies could make market "supply heavy."Federal initiatives "would be welcomed," he said.    Report said govt. has legitimate role in promoting or sponsoringspace activities because supplying "national transportationinfrastructure was always a government function."  For example, U.S.paid high up-front costs for interstate highway system and therebyencouraged creation of new jobs and methods of transporting goodsand new services.  It also "induced" commercialization of aviationin 1920s-1930s through mail subsidies and "can do the same thing forspace" since boosters are "major highways and feeder systems -- theinfrastructure -- that must be in place if commercialization ofspace" is to occur, study said.    Foreign competition also provides justification for federalassistance since U.S. private launch companies suffer fromdisadvantage of competing against boosters owned by foreign govts.,not by private foreign companies, report said, so U.S. could attemptto channel benefits from its R&D to private sector.  In past,foreign companies have benefited from such R&D by copying andimproving on U.S.-financed designs, building 2nd-generation hardwareat cheaper costs, study said, citing Ariane launch systems, Spotsatellites for remote sensing, Japanese communications equipment.    Precise picture of profitable future investment prospects isn'tclear and companies are working to focus it, several industryspokesmen said.  Conroy said:  "MD is working very hard to see howit should position itself" to obtain sound market share.  GDspokesman said:  "Potential markets must be identified beforechanges in our marketing strategy can be made."  Conroy said he feltlack of budget for Advanced Launch System (ALS) (SCB Dec 29 p6)would intensify competition for federal payloads, creating situationsimilar to Japan's, where number of companies in single industrymust battle for small number of contracts.  U.S. Dept. ofTransportation estimates worldwide civilian demand is only 15-25satellites and suborbital payload launches through 1995.    Report said reevaluation of govt. controls will prove necessaryas some activities transfer from public to private sector.  In past,U.S.:  (1) Owned all launch vehicles and all satellites.  (2) Had tomanifest and process all satellites before launch.  (3) Set pricesfor launching private payloads until recently.  Companies now arefree to declare their own launch prices and, thanks to efforts tostreamline liftoff management, number of special licenses and safetyinspections formerly required by govt. probably will be cut back.    Proposals to build private launch facilities, if carried out,could lower costs.  Hawaii, Fla. and Australia have been named aspossible sites.  Operation of private launch pads would eliminateneed for govt. to set fees for use of facilities on its property,report said.  However, some high costs will remain because ofup-front investments required for space hardware that "cannot berecouped if the project fails" and because of insuranceexpenditures, study said.Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE COMMERCE BULLETIN via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1990PENTAGON SEEKS TO USE SPACE FACILITIES IN DRUG WAR ROLE    Administration is studying Defense Dept. proposals that, ifapproved, would allow use of photoreconnaissance and signalsintelligence (SIGINT) satellites to track international drugtraffickers, Pentagon officials said.  Defense Secy. Richard Cheneyand Gen. Colin Powell, head of Joint Chiefs of Staff, have endorsedseveral drug surveillance schemes submitted to National SecurityCouncil (NSC).  President Bush is expected to approve plans at NSCmeetings later this month, Air Force officials said.    Last year DoD spurned urgings by members of Congress to assumerole in fighting drug wars.  However, faced with tightening budgetsand fading East-West tensions, Pentagon decided combating illicitdrugs offers possible way to fight fiscal cutbacks and retainpolitical clout, Air Force officials said.    Details of proposals remain classified.  However, congressionalstaffer cited 2 plans that would:  (1) Use high-resolutionphotoreconnaissance satellites such as KH-11s to monitor shiftinglocation of drug bases or pinpoint drug processing labs in LatinAmerica and Caribbean.  (2) Relay satellite-gathered data to U.S.Navy ships that would interdict drug shipments from Southeast Asia.    Change in Pentagon's policy reportedly stems from Cheney andPowell, who knew Administration was going to give high priority towar on drugs.  Previous Defense Secys. Caspar Weinberger and FrankCarlucci strongly opposed congressional suggestions of militaryrole.  Congress's interest in using military facilities became clearin late Dec. 1988 when passage of Defense Authorization Act gave N.American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) antidrug role.  NORAD'schief mission is to warn Pentagon of potential Soviet bomber ormissile attacks on N. America, yet its head, Air Force Gen. JohnPiotrowski, recently said that fighting drugs has become its"2nd-highest priority."    NORAD is using ground radar, AWACs radar planes and fighters tointercept drug trafficking in Caribbean but wants supplementalnetwork of satellites because of large area to be monitored.  AirForce in Dec. 1988 asked for Space-Based Wide Area surveillancesystem but budget cuts slowed program.  "It's still sitting there,vegetating," Air Force spokesman said.  Version of space-basedsystem reportedly is among proposals submitted to NSC, another AirForce spokesman said.    Could existing DoD space assets handle new mission?  Someexpressed doubt.  Paul Stares, military space analyst atWashington-based Brookings Institution, said:  "There aren't thatmany satellites up there -- 3 KH-11s, an upgraded KH-11, 2 Magnums[SIGINT birds] -- and most assignments for them were made way inadvance.  But you'd think that Pentagon officials would sit downwith Defense Intelligence Agency [DIA] experts and see if newdesignated targets really could be monitored before submittingproposals."    Another expert said he thought Pentagon might be overburdened byantidrug role.  Jeffrey Richelson, space intelligence expert atWashington-based National Security Archive, said:  "How much can youdo before you overstretch your resources?  I think existing[satellite] assets are already heavily tasked by various agenciessuch as DIA and the CIA."    New DoD program also could prove hard on birds, both said.Recent proposals may mean military geosynchronous spy satelliteswould have to be repositioned to cover targets, shortening theirlifespan, Stares said.  He said this probably could be avoided incase of SIGINT or radar-imaging birds such as Lacrosse.  ButRichelson said SIGINT birds, not geosynchronous units, might requirerepositioning:  "The KH-11s would probably stay where they are, butnot the SIGINTs, because in the past SIGINT birds in the WesternHemisphere directed their coverage at the European-Asian landmass.I would think some of the older versions such as Chalets or Vortexeswould have to be moved" and more might be needed.    Heavy data flow could prevent launching of additional birdsbecause of Pentagon's concern that more information might begenerated than DoD would be able to analyze.  Richelson said:  "Itbecomes a question of data management.  Even if you could launch anadditional satellite -- say it was a photoreconnaissance -- youcouldn't support it without turning half the country intophotointerpreters."Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE COMMERCE BULLETIN via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1990DEFENSE SPENDING CUTS LEAD TO PROPOSED SALE OF FORD AEROSPACE    Ford Motor Co. said it's trying to sell Ford Aerospace Corp.Confirming "ballpark" figure, official said unidentified potentialbuyer had made $1.8 billion preliminary offer.  Disclosure followedweeks of rumors and, as late as Jan. 5, denials from Ford Aerospacespokesman that company was on block.  Questions remain whether salewould include all Ford Aerospace holdings, including BDMInternational, McLean, Va.;  Space Missions, Seabrook, Md.;Washington Operations, company's east coast hq.  Company, withHughes and GM, is one of "Big 3" U.S. communications satellitemanufacturers.  Ford Aerospace spokeswoman said that company policyprohibits comment on "speculative stories about acquisitions" butthat it would release public announcement "to clarify the rumorssoon."    Proposed sale reportedly was undertaken for 2 reasons:  (1)Uncertainties over govt. defense spending in wake of warmingEast-West relations.  (2) Need to focus on automaking in face ofdeclining sales and intensifying global competition.  Prospectusdescribing Aerospace unit reportedly had been distributed topotential buyers, with Alcatel/Aerospatiale (AA), Boeing, Lockheed,Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas and TRW among those that may beinterested.  Boeing, MD, MM and TRW declined comment, and Lockheedsaid it hadn't heard of possible sale.  AA officials weren'tavailable.    Ford is holding regularly scheduled board meeting Jan. 11(Thurs., after our deadline) and former Ford Aerospace official saidprospectus for proposed sale "has been prepared" and would be onagenda.  Company books then would be inspected by prospectivebuyer's visiting team, ex-official said.  Goldman Sachs is acting asFord Motor financial adviser, he said.  Ford wouldn't be firstautomaker to react to concern that thaw in East-West relationsspells reductions in federal spending on weaponry:  Chrysler Corp.announced last month it was pulling out of defense business.General Motors has denied any interest in selling its HughesAircraft Co. subsidiary, which started laying off 6,000 of its75,000 employes in 2nd half of 1989.    Ford Aerospace received $1.7 billion in contracts, both civilianand military, in fiscal 1989.  Company is "in good shape," sourceclose to Ford said.  It has 17,000 employees, and spokesman said 70%of its business is with military.  Ford Aerospace produces Chaparraland Sidewinder missiles and is heavily involved in satellitemanufacture.  It also runs military's jet pilot training ranges andNASA's mission control center in Houston and is building parts ofU.S. space station to be orbited in late 1990s.    Ford Motor Co.'s auto sales dropped 22% in late Dec. from sameperiod last year, but it reportedly was only domestic automaker toincrease its market share in 1989.  Ford, which has about $2 billioncash on hand, acquired U.K.'s Jaguar auto company in Nov. for $2.5billion and in Aug. purchased nation's 3rd largest independentfinance company, Associates First Capital Corp., for $3.4 billion.    In other business, Ford Aerospace said it had completedfabrication of 2nd Superbird satellite for Space CommunicationsCorp. (SCC), Japan, and had shipped it to launch site in Kourou,French Guyana.  "This program has demonstrated its commitment to itscustomers," Commercial Space Programs Operations Dir. ChristopherHoeber said.

New device is 2.1-in. silicon square containing more than 4million transistors that act as "brain" or central processor inadvanced digital signal processing systems such as those thatcontrol communications satellites.  Chip, designated CPUAX (CentralProcessing Unit - Arithmetic Extended) SuperChip, is able to performat world's fastest operating speed -- 200 million actions per sec.TRW VHSIC Programs Dir. Thomas Zimmerman said:  "Two hundred millionoperations per second mean the CPUAX... is the computationalequivalent of some supercomputers that fill an entire room, requireelaborate refrigeration systems and weigh several tons."  SuperChipis able to repair itself during operation when used in conjunctionwith TRW-Motorola Universal Processor chip consisting of 36,000devices that test, monitor and configure "on-chip assets of CPUAX,"company said.    Potential uses are numerous, ranging from spacecraft to jetfighters and missiles, Zimmerman said.  Tiny size and great powermean it potentially could replace hundreds of thousands ofmicroprocessors currently used aboard spacecraft.  He said possiblecommercial applications include any program where high speed, smallsize and great computing power are required, including medicaldiagnosis, complex imaging, factory operations, computer-aideddesign.    However, immediate commercial potential is limited, DoDspokesman said. Only handful of new chips has been produced and theymust compete with cheaper, more readily available microprocessors.Time also will be required to integrate new devices into existingproducts and manufacturing processes, he said.  Team of DoD analystsalready is studying best potential market applications.

Columbia's next task is to retrieve LDEF and 57Marshall Space Center experiments that are expected to provide keyinsights into effects of space on materials (SCB Dec 29 p2).  LDEFwas predicted to enter earth's atmosphere in Feb. and burn up if notrescued.  LDEF had been scheduled to be retrieved 10 months afterbeing placed in orbit in 1984 but scheduling problems and 1986Challenger disaster caused 5-year delay.  Orbiter must be careful inrescuing satellite since craft could be in fragile condition, NASAsaid.  Shuttle was to retrieve LDEF using remote manipulator system(RMS).  It first was to pass below spacecraft and circle up and overit.  Called R-Bar approach, this doesn't require close-inflyaround.  Maneuver was to face Columbia's payload bay toward earthwith LDEF between and perpendicular to earth and orbiter.  Whenorbiter is 400 ft. from LDEF with RMS arm extended, yaw maneuverwill place satellite directly above crew compartment, allowing Cmdr.Dan Brandenstein and Pilot James Wetherbee to fly at same speed anddirection as LDEF.

Angelo Codevilla, senior research fellow at HooverInstitute, Palo Alto, and former Senate Intelligence Committeestaffer, said boosters aren't built efficiently because "therearen't any assembly lines."  Instead, components are processed inwidely separated parts of "enormous" company compounds so processworks "with all the efficiency of a cottage industry," he said.  ArtConroy, McDonnell Douglas commercial space analyst, agreed:  "Wehave a cottage industry approach, and the only thing that will everchange it is a traumatic recession."  "Nowhere in the space world,"Codevilla said, "does industry work on advanced manufacturingpatterns, with the exception of the assembly line Hughes uses tobuild its communications satellites."  Outdated production methodsare caused chiefly by reluctance of govt. to "make predictablelong-term investment" for large volume purchase of launchers thatwould justify expense to companies of establishing assembly linessimilar to those used by Soviet Union to produce Proton and otherboosters, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE COMMERCE BULLETIN via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1990    Financially troubled American Rocket asked vendors for 60-day    Financially troubled American Rocket asked vendors for 60-dayextension of credit.

Now, here's the news:Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetSeptember 1990NASA UNLIKELY TO SUBMIT REVISED LUNAR/MARS PLANS     NASA will most likely not submit a formal alternativelunar/Mars mission architecture plan to the Administration'srecently established "Synthesis Group," according to JefferyRosendahl, NASA's Assistant Director For Space Exploration(International).     The Synthesis group was established by the Administration toevaluate alternative lunar/Mars approaches, technologies andideas gathered through a public outreach program kicked-off lastspring.  According to organizers, the ultimate goal of the groupis to produce 2 or more relatively distinct final missionarchitectures which would then be studied for 3-5 years.     While NASA has taken a further look at the various issuessurrounding accomplishment of the lunar/Mars missions sincesubmitting its "90-day Report" on the subject last fall,Rosendahl told SPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY last week that NASAofficials are currently leaning against submitting any kind ofrevised lunar/Mars mission architecture plans.A Cautious Approach To Lunar/Mars Recommendations     Last fall, the agency received sizable criticism for theconservative approach it used when outlining how the UnitedStates could accomplish the President's goals of manned missionsto the moon and Mars.  But although NASA Administrator RichardTruly had yet to make a final decision on the issue last week,according to Rosendahl it will not likely use this latestopportunity to answer that criticism.     "If the Synthesis Group does its job right, they willproduce the architectures" following their review this year,Rosendahl said.  "Our indications from the (SynthesisGroup)...are that they don't want NASA to bring in anarchitecture or anybody else, necessarily.  They believe that'stheir job," he said.     But, he admits that there are other reasons why the nation'sspace agency is taking such a cautious approach to furtherlunar/Mars-related recommendations--the bulk of which appear tobe undeniably rooted in experience.     Rosendahl explained that there are 2 primary "traps" NASAofficials hope to avoid and 2 potential newspaper headlinesthey'd rather not read.     The first "trap" could be a situation where NASA makesrecommendations that are too specific and is subsequently seen asbacking a plan that may be in competition with the lunar/Marsplans of others.  "We do not want to get into a situation wherewe're seen as getting into a contest" with other potentialexploration organizers or see newspaper headlines that read "NASABACKS PLAN X."     On the other hand, perhaps an even worst perception would bethat after months of further study and in the midst of manyinnovative lunar/Mars suggestions coming forward, the agencycouldn't produce any further creative ideas on the subject."NASA FAILS TO COME UP WITH ANY IDEAS," Rosendahl jokes.     He admits, though, that the agency is much "smarter" on themissions than it was last year and has conducted furtherlunar/Mars studies at both NASA headquarters and field centers     "We've looked at a broader range of options," he said."Different schedules, different content, different levels ofambition, different levels of technology."Small Number of Factors Will Drive Program Content     "In a certain sense, it's beginning to look like there arereally a small number of things that wind up driving programcontent, what a total program might look like.  They seemed to besort of the scope and scale of what you'd like to do when you getthere, the kind of presence you'd like to have, the kind ofoperations you'd like to do, the number of people you want tohave to carry them out, the level of technology that youemploy...Are you going to use simple extrapolations of currenttechnology or are you going to try and make major developments innew technology?"  Other variables include cost and schedule,Rosendahl added.     Lockheed's Director for Space Station Operations, GusGustafero, agrees that those types of top-level decisions arecritical to how a lunar/Mars mission architecture is actuallyshaped.  "Those are the things that have to be defined.Sometimes architecture is defined in terms of what you want to dowhen you get there and some people define it as `Here's how youget there and don't worry about what you do when you get there.'But I think you've got to work the problem backwards.     "You have to decide, either on the moon or Mars, what you'regoing to do when you get there and then build a mission scenarioof how you're going to get there and then below that, startworking with functional requirements that decide things like whatkind of propulsion system do you want to work with--a nuclear orchemical propulsion system?  Do you want solar arrays on thesurface or do you want radioactive isotope generators or do youwant to use fuel cells for power?"     When and at what level the broader decisions will be made isnot clear yet.  "That's an interesting question," Rosendahl said."We have not been getting any strong signals from the (National)Space Council as to what the boundary conditions and constraintsmight be.  I think they're waiting to see what options (theSynthesis Group) might want to come in with and what thedifferences are."NASA Will Strive For Flexible Management Plan     With regard to what NASA's inputs will consist of, Rosendahlsaid the agency will most likely steer its latest recommendationstoward broader management issues of how the Space ExplorationInitiative (SEI) program should be laid out during the next 3years.     "I think we are going to discuss something about how youmight lay out a near-term program...The real issue is the next 3years.  (NASA's recommendations) are basically a programmaticapproach to laying this out which would make some sense so thatyou have a way of developing enough information to makeintelligent decisions.     "There is also an issue...as to whether you couldoverspecify things now by specifying, for example, `Use thisparticular engine and that particular component' versus `Here are3 alternative technologies you ought to pursue.  When you havethe answers to the following sets of questions, then you can makea decision.'     "We will probably lay out the program, what our views are asto what information needs to be developed to make decisions andwe will probably wind up giving our views on technologies.  Howmuch further, whether we're actually going to talk about systemsand architectures, I'm not sure.  We're more interested in makingsure that we present enough information for (the Synthesis Group)to work on based on a perspective, rather than any particularapproach.     "...We obviously have an interest in making sure that...asensible set of options come out...from the other end of theSynthesis Group.  I think our interest is in having a sensibleprogram that we can go out and execute on behalf of the country"should Congress and the Administration decide to do so, he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetSeptember 1990ORGANIZERS REPORT FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO OUTREACH EFFORT     After a relatively slow start, organizers of the spaceexploration outreach program say a recently completed 3-montheffort to gather innovative ideas on the subject was a success,both quantitatively and qualitatively.     The outreach effort, begun late last spring, consisted ofcalls to the traditional aerospace community, as well as thegeneral public for alternative methods of achieving mannedmissions to the moon and Mars.     The 2 primary methods of solicitation involved the AmericanInstitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), which requestedideas from its members, as well as the Rand Corp., which, underNASA's direction, set up a toll-free public phone number andissued response packages to anyone wishing to submit an idea.  Inaddition, universities, NASA employees and various othertechnical groups were called upon.     In mid-summer, responses to the Rand and AIAA effort werereportedly light.  But "it's obviously picked up since then,"NASA's Jeffery Rosendahl said.  The Rand Corp. is expecting toget some 3,000 ideas from its outreach efforts "which is going togive them plenty of things to do or to take a look at.  We arejust starting to break it up (the responses) by discipline, butthe responses were rather broadly spread across over everytechnology that the sciences consist of...So they're beginning togo through the job (of sorting through the responses) and to makesome sort of an input to the (Synthesis Group) towards lateSeptember or October," Rosendahl said.     As of Aug. 17, the Rand Corporation had received more than10,000 requests for response packets under the outreach programand 3,302 notices of intent to submit ideas.  Of the intendedresponses, 68.7% are expected to come from individuals; 16.3%from aerospace companies and other for-profit enterprises; and8.1% from educational institutions.  The remainder are in othercategories.     Space transportation was the largest category of intendedresponses to Rand with 16.7%.  Other categories include missionconcepts (16.5%); life support systems (10.3%); structures andmaterials (9.8%); space and surface power (7.4%); spaceprocessing and manufacturing (6.3%); system design and analysis(5.7%); automation and robotics (4.7%); communications (4.1%);ground support and simulation (3.4%); and information systems(2.3%).AIAA Gets Good Response; But Few Surprises     In addition to the Rand effort, "the AIAA is hard at work,"Rosendahl said.  "They've collected hundreds of ideas and they'vegot a number of technical committees that have been set up thatare going through those ideas and coming up with their own ideas.A lot of that is going to culminate at the AIAA Space ExplorationInitiative (SEI) outreach conference Sept. 5 and 6.  And weourselves will get the first inkling, I think, of what's comingout of that at that conference."     AIAA's Director of Science and Technology Policy, Dr. JerryGrey, told SET that the association received a total of some 530responses from its members.  Of those, Grey estimates that about450 could be considered "really responsible."     "The response was much greater than we thought and thequality was extremely high."  Most of the ideas that weresubmitted were not surprising though, Grey said.  "There's almostno such thing as a new idea.  Many of them (the responses) wererevised concepts" of ideas that have been around for awhile or"old technology done in a new way."     Grey said the type of responses received varied greatly fromoverall mission architecture concepts to a new way to make a boltfasten better.From Bolts To Architecture--Type of Responses Vary     AIAA's criteria for evaluating the proposals was extremelyloose, Grey explained.  "We didn't take any programmatics intoaccount," he said.  The primary criteria used to analyze theresponses were things such as `Does the idea violate the laws ofphysics?  Is it applicable to space exploration?  Is it alreadybeing considered or included in the baseline technologies understudy?  And does it have any benefits over the currentbaseline?'"     AIAA's process of evaluating the responses is already wellunderway.  About 120 volunteers are assessing the responses, with5 working technical analysis groups established.  They include:architectures, transportation, planetary surface systems andtechnologies, human support technologies and, finally,infrastructure.     An AIAA spokesperson said the largest number of responseshave been in the categories of architecture, planetary surfacesystems and infrastructure.     As of late August, about 200 people had signed up for AIAA'supcoming SEI outreach conference with final attendance expectedto range between 300 to 400 people.  The conference will includepresentations of AIAA's initial assessments of the responses.AIAA is slated to make a preliminary report to the Synthesisgroup in the beginning of September.  On Oct. 1, it will produceanother version of its assessment which will incorporate some ofthe requests made previously by the Synthesis group for moreintense focus, Grey said.  A final AIAA report is due to theSynthesis group in December.     Representatives of 10 major aerospace corporationsmeanwhile, will meet with the Synthesis group Sept. 10-14 topresent their perspectives on future space exploration.     While the exact timetable for the Synthesis Group's effortshad not yet been announced at our deadline late last month, thegroup has been working to a spring deadline for presentation ofthe major architectures.Stafford Group Membership Announced     At a press conference late last month, Synthesis ChairmanLt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford announced that the senior membershipof the group would include 21 well known aerospace and defenseofficials including, Dr. Robert Seamans, Vice Chairman of thegroup, and Lt.

The space community has been hoping for a more favorablereception from the Senate to the Administration's FY 1991 SEI-related budget request than was granted by the House earlier thisyear.  But there was little indication of that prior to Congress'August recess.     [The House cut a total of about $337 million in SEI-relatedfunding from NASA's FY 1991 budget earlier this year includingall of the $188 million in new funding for initial technologystudies.  The total request includes about $800 million to a $1billion in total SEI-related funding.]     The key Senate panel, which oversees NASA's appropriations,is facing a significantly tougher fiscal predicament than itsHouse counterpart faced earlier this year when it marked up itsversion of the FY '91 NASA money bill.  Specifically the SenateHUD, VA and Independent Agencies panel, chaired by Sen. BarbaraMikulski (D-Md.), has received a total allocation that is some$627 million lower than the House had to work with.     At issue with regard to the SEI funding request, is therelatively small amount of "new funds" for SEI-related technologyand mission architecture studies.  The $188 million earmarked fortechnology studies in NASA's $15.125 billion FY '91 request and$37 million in mission architecture studies sparked a debateearlier this year that almost rivaled those which occurred in theearly years of Space Station Freedom development.  The Housesubsequently zeroed all such funding complaining thatAdministration had failed to make a convincing case as to how thePresident's SEI would be paid for in later years.  SEI proponentshave countered that the request represents funds only for initialstudy work which would help to answer basic questions surroundingpotential lunar/Mars missions and that the request does notrepresent a commitment to actually carrying out the program.     Nonetheless, a grim overall federal budget picture with thepotential for significant sequestration in October, as well aslittle progress reported in the high-level WhiteHouse/congressional budget talks, are adding up to a dim outlookfor space exploration-related funding in FY '91.Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetSeptember 1990EXPLORATION PROPONENTS BET ON MIKULSKI     Proponents of SEI hope that Mikulski can come up withanywhere from $37 million to $100 million of the SEI fundingwhich they believe would be enough to keep the initial studiesgoing, as well as industry interest, etc.     How likely that will be and how much more of theAdministration's support will be forthcoming for the initiativegiven the overall federal budget issues facing the nation and theless than favorable response it has already received on the Hillso far is an open question.  While the timing of the recentgalvanization of the technical community through the SEI outreachprogram has been the source of concern and uneasiness in light ofthe budget predicament, as well as NASA's recent technicalproblems, it may actually work to the benefit of SEI proponentsby keeping attention focused on initiatives.     Regardless, a top space expert told SPACE EXPLORATIONTECHNOLOGY that the National Space Council appears to have had nochoice but to move forward with the highly visible outreachprogram, as most of its planning occurred before it becameapparent that sizable congressional opposition to the initiativeexisted.  "There is a bit of a disconnect, I think, between theplans for the outreach program and the political reality.  Allthese plans for outreach were put in place early this year beforeit became apparent that at least many in Congress weren'tinterested in buying into this program.     "I think there's an interesting disjoint between mobilizingthe technical community and giving the high visibility to theirconclusions and suggestions, setting the Rand program up anddoing newspaper advertising...and the fact that the politicalfate of the program still is uncertain.  But nobody is gonna' goback and say, `Whoops, it's too early to do a high profileoutreach.'  We just go through it.  A lot of people believe thatthe timing isn't the best.  But you know you take Presidentialendorsements when you can get'em, not when the timing is right.     "It is my impression, and it is only an impression, thatthey anticipate getting a little money out of the Senate and outof the (budget) conference in order to not kill SEI as a concept,but to limp along with some low-level studies during fiscal '91.But I don't have a high level of confidence in having said that."     Others remain optimistic.  Although it is clear that a muchmore convincing case for the missions has to be made both to theCongress and the American public, NASA's Jeffery Rosendahl saidhe remains hopeful that some of the funds in question will beapproved.  Clearly, "We have a lot more explaining to do,"Rosendahl said.  But he believes a significant amount of workcould be done even if the agency gets only $35 million to $50million of the study funds.     "We've done a remarkable amount of work" just with relatedFY 1990 funding, he said.  A major step forward could be madewith a small amount of FY 1991 funding for major technologyidentification as well as specific mission architectures, headded.     AIAA's Jerry Grey said while the association's members wereclearly disappointed with the recent congressional action on theSEI request, he believes a better explanation of what the fundswill be used for could help to free up $50 million or so for thestudies.Most Major Aerospace Corp.'s Will Vie For A Piece Of TheExploration Pie     While the traditional aerospace industry has been seen bysome as less than enthusiastic on the SEI effort, nearly all ofthe major aerospace companies have expressed interest in playinga significant role in SEI or bidding on the larger missionarchitecture contracts which could be awarded in the years ahead.And many say they are prepared to make a substantial investmentin preparation for the initiative.     Martin Marietta's Ben Clark, who has overseen many of thecompany's Mars studies, said Martin has and will continue toinvest in advanced space activities such as the Mars study work.Clark said the company is also investing in the public educationactivities which are deemed critical to success of the effort.Martin, which is a contractor on the upcoming unmanned Mars probeeffort, is presently studying a number of ways to accomplishmanned Mars missions and will present its ideas to the SynthesisGroup in mid-September, Clark added.  Likewise, Lockheed'sDirector of Space Station Operations, Gus Gustafero, said hiscompany is also prepared for what promises to be a series of longand tough SEI-related political funding battles.     "We're at a period of time in a program of this size that'sgoing to be with us for possibly the next 30 or 40 years.

The Huntsville, Ala., space communityis using its knowhow to attack one of the prime obstacles facingspace exploration planners--a lack of adequate spacetransportation systems capable of carrying out the U.S.'s futurespace goals.     Bill Huber of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center's ProgramDevelopment Office is coordinating the center's SEI studies whichare based, in part, on studies already in place when SpaceExploration Initiative (SEI) was formed, reports SPACEEXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY special correspondent Dave Dooling.  The 3largest activities are the Space Transportation InfrastructureStudy (STIS) with General Dynamics and 2 Space Transfer Vehicle(STV) studies with Martin Marietta and Boeing.  "These contractswere really in place ahead of SEI," Huber said, "but they aresupporting us directly and the results are being fed directlyinto our activities."     The STIS effort initially will develop a data baseincorporating virtually everything that can be compiled aboutspace transportation systems, costs and projections.     NASA will then task General Dynamics to impose differentmission requirements--such as landing on Mars or servicing theSpace Station--on the database.  The system will then describetransportation system requirements to support the mission anddescribe what other missions may also be supported.     "STIS start on the ground," said Boeing's James Kingsbury."We start in space."  The STV studies look at "transferring massfrom Point A to Point B, and Points A and B can be most anythingyou want."  The latter definition has been stretched to includepoints on the planet's surface.     The STV studies descended from Space Tug studies in the1970s.  Activities at Boeing and Martin Marietta includeanalyzing concepts systems to go from Earth orbit to the surfaceof the moon and Mars and include pressurized and unpressurizedrovers.     Huber said that "the main SEI activity [at MSFC] in the last6 months has been to go back and examine the `90-day study' [apreliminary SEI study], do some trades studies and look at otherways of going to the moon and Mars."     Marshall is the lead center for Shuttle-C, an all-cargoderivative of the Shuttle that could support lunar missions andis NASA's lead center for the Advanced Launch System (ALS).  Buteven ALS, most analysts concede, would be inadequate for thelarge quantities of cargo that a Mars base would require.     "We are looking at bigger launch vehicles" for the Earth-to-Orbit leg, Huber said. "That would reduce the amount of assemblyin lunar orbit."  Studies now focus on Shuttle derivatives andALS and have not seriously considered Russia's Energia because ofits inclination problems.  "It's hard to think of a totally`clean-sheet' design," Huber added.  "There's almost an infinitenumber of combinations of engines and staging."  Part of thatconsideration includes the Advanced Manned Launch System understudy by Rockwell and Langley.     Marshall's studies are also focusing on the role of the U.S.Space Station and whether assembly nodes in low Earth orbit or ingeostationary orbit are better than in lunar orbit.  One way toreduce launch and assembly requirements would be to use one-way,direct-ascent cargo landers.     "Getting there" is the next problem.  One of the biggesttrades in the 90-day study was to select chemical propulsion andaerobrakes, Huber said, but there is a role for nuclear andelectric propulsion techniques.  "In terms of early candidates,"nuclear thermal, like the Nuclear Engine for Rocket VehicleApplication (NERVA), is the most likely.  The technology is wellunderstood and the project was near flight test when cancelled inthe 1970s.  However, open-air testing is not likely to berepeated.     A less powerful but more efficient system is championed byDr. Ernst Stuhlinger, a former associate director of Marshall andnow an independent consultant.  His electric propulsion theories,first published in 1954, remain the same even with technologyupdates, he said.     Electric propulsion ionizes a working fluid, then repels itfrom like-charged electrodes.  Although the technology has beenflown on a small scale, it remains limited because the thrust istoo low for quick escape from a planet.  Stuhlinger proposeschemical propulsion to boost a Mars ship to 40,000 km altitude(about geostationary) and nuclear-electric propulsion for thetrip to Mars.  There would be 2 vehicles, each carrying a crew of2 or 3, and a freight vehicle with exploration equipment.     The departure mass would be up to 320 tons, including 140tons of mercury fuel, which would serve as solar storm shielding.A 50-megawatt reactor would power the thrusters.     Stuhlinger calculates that the trip out would take 180 days.Such a mission should be designed for a high scientific yield andnot be a "Kilroy was here" mission.     Another key issue also is "To `g' or not to `g.'  That isthe question" when crew health and weightlessness are considered.Artificial-gravity is included in designs by Gene Austin's spacetransportation and exploration office at Marshall.     One concept has 2 Space Station-type modules that pivot outto produce "down" along the long axis behind the protection ofthe heat shield for planetary aerobraking.  Mike Remus of ThiokolCorporation has used computers to produce a striking video ofthis.     Transportation on a smaller scale is under study by engineerBrand Griffin and artist Paul Hudson of Griffin-Hudson (formerlySpaceworks).  Their work is familiar to many in the spacebusiness through Hudson's paintings of Griffin'sdesigns.  Griffin said that he is hoping for funding from AIAA'soutreach program for 2 proposals.  The first is a manned/autonomouswork station based on Wernher von Braun's "space bottle," whichwould contain an astronaut at full cabin pressure and be equippedwith integral propulsion plus various mission kits and effectors.It could also operate unmanned.     The other concept is the "lunar hopper," which would be aflying jeep for astronauts working on the lunar surface.     Kingsbury said the rover studies incorporate requirements suchas construction (and instability of vehicles that becomelightweight on the moon and Mars) and extended treks to explore thesurface.  The latter might require hauling a large life supporttrailer or, like Antarctic explorers, setting up mini-outpostsalong the trail.     MSFC's Huber said that while there has been some examinationof novel approaches--such as a low, wide Griffin-Hudson lunarlander design--most lander concepts are "pretty much like Apollo,"he said.     Finally, feeding and watering crews on long space journeys isbeing studied at 2 universities here.  The Center for Space LifeSciences at the University of Alabama in Huntsville is definingwater quality requirements for any system that would recycle water.And Alabama A & M University is analyzing rabbits as a potentialspace food that could be grown and harvested in relatively shortcycles (every few months) and yield high-protein, low-cholesterolmeat.Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetSeptember 1990JOHNSON LOOKS TO DIFFERENT LUNAR/MARS "PHILOSOPHIES"     Johnson Space Center officials said they have spent asignificant amount of time during the past year reviewing new"philosophies" related to future space exploration.  "In the 90-day effort, we put together one way of doing the mission and thatwas based on some work that had been done over a period ofyears," noted Doug Cook, director of the Moon and MarsExploration Program office.     "We knew that was a possible way to go which would work andwhich would hold together.  But we knew there were other options.So, as an agency, we are currently looking at otheralternatives."     JSC officials explained, however, that they are looking intonew philosophies as opposed to alternative architectures.  "Asfar as new technologies go, we really don't know what might comeup," said one official.  "We're trying to come up with adifferent approach, alternative management and decision-makingprograms.  The object is to do it [land on the moon and Mars] asbest, as fast and as cheaply as we can.  With a looser managementapproach. We're not locked into any kind of set architecture.  Ifwe find a way that would get us there faster or cheaper, it canbe built in."     The Moon and Mars Exploration Program Office, located atJSC, is responsible for coordinating NASA's input and bringingforth recommendations for the Synthesis Group, as well as fortracking the lunar/Mars studies that are being conducted at the 9field centers.     Cook explained that the program office is divided intomission and development, which is concerned with "actual in-spaceoperations," and systems engineering and integration.  "Here, weare making sure that the end-to-end design of the entire set ofelements [all the major hardware, such as space vehicles andhabitats] are consistent and that they match up in theircapabilities and interfaces.     "You don't want to build, for instance, some kind of vehicleservicing unit that sits on the moon that supplies, say, 75KW toa lander.  Then the lander gets there and it doesn't need but5KW.  So we want to make sure we balance the capabilities withthe requirements."     Under a second office recently set up at JSC, the Moon andMars Exploration Projects Office, JSC officials are studyingplanet surface systems, including inflatable habitats, powersystems on the surface, roving vehicles and construction tools,and provide support to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in roboticsstudies.  In addition, the Human Robotics Spacecraft Office isplanning JSC's part of the Mars Rover Sample Return.     Cook noted that 60 JSC employees are currently working onSEI-related projects.  "We are in a study mode," he explained.     Cook also stated that no (major) contracts have been awardedon any projects that are being studied under NASA's currentproposal.  The budget allocated to Johnson for SEI-relatedstudies is projected at $6.9 million for FY '90, a figure Cookdefined as "insignificant compared to JSC's budget."     Although JSC has been evaluating NASA's data and willrecommend alternative plans, Cook said that the program officehas not been asked to evaluate any outside proposals.  "We assumewe may be asked for some help in certain areas.  But I think thatis possible with the other big agencies too, so I don't seeourselves as the primary source of technical capability for thatgroup."  JSC has been working towards a September deadline fornew lunar/Mars inputs, but Cook expects that NASA's study periodto continue through the end of the year.  He also pointed outthat a center's study responsibility is not necessarily the areathat the center will develop. "We don't know what the spread ofresponsibility is going to be across the agencies within thegovernment," he said.  "It would be premature for NASA to divideup what they think the pie is going to be."Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetSeptember 1990FUEL CELL RFP STALLED DUE TO BUDGET UNCERTAINTIES     Lewis Research Center is still contemplating release of arequest for proposals (RFP) for a regenerative fuel cell systemto be used on the moon's surface, although recent cuts to the FY1991 Pathfinder budget request may stall the effort, according toprogram officials.     Lewis issued a solicitation for proposals on the system inJuly and received an "overwhelming response," according toproject manager Paul Prokopius.  Prokopius said at least 10qualification statements have been received from variouscompanies.     But an RFP release date is uncertain due to recent budgetactions by the House HUD, VA and Independent Agencies panel.  Thepanel cut the Administration's $179.4 million Pathfinder requestdown to $25.4 million earlier this summer.  The Pathfinderprogram consists of a broad-range of advanced space technologyresearch efforts.     Prokopius said the RFP could still be released later thisyear should funding be made available.     Prokopius said the system, which would help to provide powerduring the lunar night or the period when no sunlight is receivedon the moon, will consist of a power producing fuel cell stackand an electrolyzer to regenerate water produced by the fuel cellinto hydrogen and oxygen required for fuel cell operation.     The total value of the multi-year contract was initiallyestimated at $10 million, Prokopius said.  Proposals wererequested for a complete fuel cell and electrolyzer system or forthe fuel cell and electrolyzer separately and more than one awardcould made at the discretion of the government.

An official of the Los Angeles-based import-export firmPhoenix International, in a telephone interview with SET, saidhis company has received the rights from Moscow to sell the thirdPhobos spacecraft.  In addition, he said, the Venera-7 satellite,which was launched in August 1970, is also available for sale."The spacecraft are ready to be shipped" to the United States,the official said.     A leading analyst of the Soviet space program, who hasdiscussed the venture with Phoenix International, is convinced ofthe authenticity of the spacecraft.  "They (PhoenixInternational) provided too many details about the spacecraft tobe faking," he said.     The Phoenix official said a number of parties had expressedinterest in the hardware, although he would not mention specificnames, nor prices.  "The Phobos craft would probably be morevaluable because it is newer," the executive added.Potential Buyers Could Include Museums And Universities     Other sources said museums and universities would likely beinterested.  Although a Japanese firm acquired backup hardwarefor the Soviet Mir space station last year, Tokyo is not a likelycustomer for the Phobos craft, sources said.  "They can build abetter spacecraft themselves," one said, referring to the factthat both Phobos missions ended in failure.     The Phobos craft put on the market by Moscow served as thebackup hardware for the 2 nearly identical probes sent into spaceon July 7 and 12, 1988, respectively.  Both missions failed,however, when they lost contact with mission controllers.  Thefirst probe lost contact with Earth on Sept. 2, 1988; the secondof the 6,200 kg probes was incapacitated on March 26, 1989.Soviet officials said poor workmanship and a series of incorrectground commands were the culprits.     The proposed sale surprised a number of analysts sinceMoscow had expressed interest in launching the third Phoboscraft.  In July 1989, Valeri Barsukov, a senior Soviet spaceofficial, said the uprated ground test vehicle could "in theory"be flown prior to the planned 1996 Phobos sample return mission.     "We could fly sooner, in 1992, but we do not want to repeatthe mission profile of the and schedule of the Phobos mission, wewant to add something... (like) a sample return mission,"Barsukov said.  "But, we need time to get ready for such amission," he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetSeptember 1990DESIGN FOR MIR FOLLOW-ON SAID TO BE COMPLETED     Meanwhile, Soviet engineers have apparently completed workon the design of the large Mir-2 space station, which will be thefollow-on to the current Mir facility and will be transported bythe Energia heavy-lift vehicle, according to Soviet news reports.     Mir-2 will weigh several hundred metric tons and fly at highaltitudes to avoid drag.  The station is likely to be placed intoan orbit of more than 400 km and consist of several 100-metric-ton structures, dwarfing today's Mir station, which weighs in atapproximately 90 metric tons.     Soviet officials have varied on a launch date for Mir-2,with some saying initial elements could be orbited as early asnext year, while most have set 1995 as the target date.Back to Headline List WT03-B28-32IA059-000320-B036-372http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae03.html 205.156.212.5 19970114202451 text/html 3630HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:23:10 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:11 GMTContent-length: 3444Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae03.html Sample Issue Copyright SPACE FAX DAILY GLOBAL EDITION via NewsNet January 3, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES HIGHLIGHTS / SPACE DAILY: GLOBAL EDITION -- Year 3, No 662 ASIA / PACIFIC (164 words) USA (129 words) EUROPE / GLOBAL (39 words) CopyrightSPACE FAX DAILY GLOBAL EDITION via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996ASIA / PACIFIC* Russia's Molniya rocket successfully launches third India  remote sensing sat, IRS-1C, and a U.S. research sat, `Skipper',  from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on 28 December, boosting Russia's  cash-starved space program by $16 million; wraps up year of  unprecedented commercial activity for Moscow's space program* China successfully launches Echostar-1 via Long March 2E  rocket, on 28 December from Xichang; Echostar Communications  Corp's stock rises 22 percent; info 303-799-8222 x5239* Taiwan and Beijing negotiating plan to cooperate on satellite  technology and share weather data, in step towards closer  relations, breakthroughs in telecom possible in 1996* Japan DMC Corp enlists aid of cable TV operator's umbrella  organization to start its 40-plus-channel digital satellite  broadcasting service this June; both to sign up viewers* Philippines and Singapore competing for hosting business  council Secretariat of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation which is  to create a free trade area encompassing its 18 members by 2020;  becoming the permanent venue would bring incresed prestige for  the chosen country's economy, experts concurBack to Headline List CopyrightSPACE FAX DAILY GLOBAL EDITION via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996USA* NASA X-Ray Timing Explorer successful launch verifies new  Redundant Inertial Flight Control Assembly avionics system for  Delta 2; satellite undergoing system checks in 580 km orbit  inclined at 23 degrees; info 714-896-6211* McDonnell Douglas Delta 2 launch of Koreasat-2 rescheduled for  14 January; Cape Canaveral AS FL* Space Shuttle Endeavour being readied for 11 January flight;  Mission Specialist Koichi Wakata of Japan will assist with  retrieval of Space Flyer Unit launched by H2 in March 1995; info  NASDA fax +81-3-5402-4130* Hughes extends two-year, $25 million line of credit to Geotek  Communications for acquisition of 900 MHz spectrum for wireless  business computing applications; info 201-930-9305* PanAmSat announces dividend on Senior Redeemable Preferred  Stock to be paid in additional shares 15 January; info fax 203-  622-9163Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE FAX DAILY GLOBAL EDITION via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996EUROPE / GLOBAL* Arianespace V 82 to launch PanAmSat-3R and MEASAT-1 on 9  January; launch preparations underway at ELA-2 at CSG in Kourou,  French Guiana; info 202-628-3936=====================================================================REGULAR EDITION OF SPACE FAX DAILY GLOBAL EDITION TO RESUME ON 4JANUARYBack to Headline List WT03-B28-33IA059-000320-B037-29http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae13.html 205.156.212.5 19970114202521 text/html 22482HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:23:30 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:17 GMTContent-length: 22295Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae13.html Sample Issue Copyright SPACE STATION NEWS via NewsNet January 8, 1990 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FRONT PAGE NEWS POWER GROWTH, ECLSS CHANGE CONSIDERED (590 words) CONGRESS HOUSE PANEL CALLS FOR MORE STATION HEARINGS (881 words) CURRENT STATION MILESTONES DETAILED (185 words) RESTON CHIEF SEES FIRM BASELINE AS KEY CHALLENGE (1765 words) CopyrightSPACE STATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990POWER GROWTH, ECLSS CHANGE CONSIDERED        Space Station officials are considering increasing the powercapability of the four Space Station photovoltaic modules and anearly closure of the Environmental Control Life Support System(ECLSS) oxygen loop, according to Reston Space Station chief RobertMoorehead.        In an interview with SPACE STATION NEWS late last week,Moorehead said the agency is considering increasing the capabilityof the four photovoltaic modules (two of which are located on eachend of the Station's truss) by an additional 3 kilowatts (KW) whichwould provide a total addition of 12KW onboard the Station atassembly complete.        The Station is currently slated to have a total of 75KW powerat assembly complete.  Of that total, it is estimated thathousekeeping or Station operations will consume 45KW and users willshare 30KW.        Prior to the recent Station changes, users were to receivesome 37-1/2KW.  Station officials officially readjusted that figurelast fall during the rephasing activity.        The availability of power onboard the Station has been a majorconcern among various Station users and Hill officials duringrecent months.        Adding to concerns over the new official lower user powerestimate have been unofficial reports out of the Reston SpaceStation office that estimates of power available to users, when theinternational modules were in place on the Station, had actuallydipped as low as 15KW (SSN, 12/18/89).        Moorehead said the extra 12KW would help solve "the perceivedpower difficulty" and could be dedicated almost entirely to Stationusers.        Although he did not indicate specifically whether theadditional 12KW would be added to the 30KW currently slated forusers or simply be used to help fulfill the 30KW user requirement,a NASA official said later that, as currently conceived, it wouldbe added to the 30KW slated for users.        Moorehead did say, that he personally believes that 45KW forhousekeeping is excessive and said Station officials would scruband scrub and scrub to reduce that figure.  The decision toincrease the power capability of the photovoltaic modules isstrictly an agency budgetary decision, Moorehead said, and poses nosignificant technical risks.Return To Original ECLSS Plans Also Contemplated        In addition to increased power, Moorehead said Stationofficials are also considering a shift back toward original ECLSSplans.  The old baseline program included a closed oxygen loopECLSS early in the Station's assembly.        In the current Station baseline, the ECLSS oxygen loop willremain open initially and be closed by assembly complete.  Lateclosure means that prior to assembly complete, oxygen will have tobe transported to the Station and at assembly complete it would beregenerated on the Station.        Station officials said last fall that the change would producesignificant front-end cost savings and some reduction of powerconsumption at the Permanent Manned Capability milestone, butconceded in congressional testimony that it would also increasetotal assembly launch weight by 6,600 lbs. due to gas storagerequirements and increase resupply weight every 90 days by 2,470lbs.        Station officials also said the change would requiredevelopment of a new cryogenic oxygen carrier needed for resupplyprior to the period when regenerative capability was added.  Costof the carrier was estimated at about $16 million.  Now, Mooreheadsaid, "a proposal (is) being submitted by the Marshall Space FlightCenter that we move that forward and close the loop and never dothis block one (initial open, then closed loop) thing that saystransport oxygen to the Station."  Both changes, "are underconsideration, but they have not been made a part of the program(or baselined)."Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE STATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990HOUSE PANEL CALLS FOR MORE STATION HEARINGS        The House Space, Science and Technology Committee will wasteno time in taking up the Space Station again when Congressreconvenes later this month.  It has currently rescheduled ahearing with the Space Station international partners for Jan. 30,at 1 p.m.  The hearing was originally planned to be conducted latelast fall when a similar hearing was held on recent Space Stationchanges, but was cancelled due to scheduling problems, according toHill officials.  In addition, look for the panel to schedule ahearing with Station officials early in its series of hearings onNASA's 1991 authorization.  Committee staffers say they hope totrack where the program has gone since the October hearing and toreexamine remaining issues.        The panel's concern over some the recent Station changes hasapparently not fully subsided since its hearing on the issue lastNovember.  A top Committee staffer reiterated Committee ChairmanRobert A. Roe's (D-N.J.) disappointment over some of the recentchanges.  The issue, he said, has become one of "credibility" withthe Committee.  Of high concern to the Committee is the idea ofwasted tax dollars associated with continuous changes.  "We do havea sense that you've got to start cutting metal at some point inearnest and at that point you've got to know what the configurationis that you're working toward.  Now, where that point comes...Imean in no way do we want to take away from NASA's managementprerogatives to make judgments on the thing, but by the same tokenI think there's just a fundamental question of spending thetaxpayers money efficiently.  You can't keep floundering aroundspending a $1 billion a year on this thing and not knowing whatyour doing."        With regard to the international hearing, a Committee staffersaid the panel hopes to examine how recent changes and uncertaintyin timing of the multi-billion project will affect politicalsupport for the program within the various participating countries.        European Space Agency (ESA) officials confirm that they willattend the hearing--with ESA director general Reimar Luestscheduled to appear--but there was no firm word at our deadline asto whether representatives from Canada and Japan would appear.        Canadian Space Station official Mac Evans said he doubts thatthe Canadians will accept the invitation, although no finaldecision had been made yet.  Canada's Department of ExternalAffairs will make the decision.  Evans reiterated the Canadiangovernment's long-standing policy concerning government officialstestifying before foreign bodies and said a rare precedent would beset if Canadian officials did testify.        A Japanese official said no word had not come from Tokyo as oflast week as to whether Japanese officials would attend.  But hesaid the decision could go either way.ESA Likely to Press Larger Multi-Year Funding Issues        An ESA official said the agency will probably use the upcominghearing on international Station concerns to address some of thebroader issues relating to the program such as long-term funding,rather than as a forum to wrestle over individual concerns.        All three of the Station international partners have expressedremaining concerns over the revised Station plans, with both theJapanese and Europeans wanting earlier module launch dates than theFebruary and June 1998 dates planned, respectively.  But althoughNASA has been reviewing and negotiating with the partners over suchconcerns, the likelihood of any major changes in this area remainsto be seen.        With regard to ESA's request, Space Station officials have seta condition for the Europeans before changing the module launchdate.        Reston Space Station chief Robert Moorehead tells SPACESTATION NEWS that although NASA's look at the situation indicatesthere are some trade-offs in the Station assembly sequence whichcould be made to accommodate an earlier ESA launch, Stationofficials want a firm commitment as to when the module will beready for launch before going any further with the change.        Although ESA has selected a prime contractor for the Columbusprogram, it has not completed negotiations on the program.  Sourcessay when Station officials toured European contractor facilitieslast fall they were given a later date from ESA contractors as towhen the module would be ready than they had received from ESAofficials, prompting their present position.        An ESA official indicated that the Europeans are confident theESA module would be ready.  Obviously, "It would be rather foolishof us to propose a date if we didn't think we could make it."  Withregard to ESA's latest launch proposal, he said it "was a differentassembly sequence that got the APM (Attached Pressurized Module) upearlier," and did not involve launching of the ESA man-tended free-flyer prior to the APM launch as has been discussed.        While the Japanese have expressed interest in an earlierJapanese Experiment Module (JEM) launch date, they seem to havebeen less insistent upon it, as compared to ESA.  A Japaneseofficial summed up their position on the matter by saying "If that(the February 1998 JEM launch date) is the minimum delay that NASAcan (offer), then I think that we will have to endure.  We werevery much upset by the fall rescheduling operation by NASA, but onthe other hand we have to be realistic about the prospects of thefuture budget of the Space Station."Back to Headline List CopyrightSPACE STATION NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990CURRENT STATION MILESTONES DETAILED        Below the current milestones for the Space Station Freedom, asprovided by NASA, are detailed.

When Moorehead, a former Space Shuttle official fromJohnson Space Flight Center, took the position of Deputy Director,Programs and Operations, he was the fourth person to head up theorganization in less than a year.  Since coming onboard, he hasoverseen the difficult task of molding the Station's assemblysequence to meet the current rephased or rescoped Space Stationprogram.  In an interview last week with SPACE STATION NEWS,Moorehead said his greatest challenge in the coming year will be toensure a stable Station baseline is in place.  Excerpts of theinterview are printed below.INTERNATIONAL CONCERNSSSN: What is the current situation with regard to earlier launchdates of the international modules?Moorehead: "The internationals have had some concerns about whenthey would be put on orbit and we have conducted some studies andwe have some ways to move them earlier in the assembly sequence.You have to make trades when you do that.  So, if you move themearlier in the assembly sequence then you have to give uputilization flights earlier so you can't do as much, if you will,with their modules, but yet they would be on-orbit.  We'veconducted that as an off-line study, but it's not a part of theprogram.  It's just an off-line study.  There have been no firmdecisions."SSN: What is the situation specifically with regard to ESA'srequest?Moorehead: "The way we view that is that there's some things thatwe could do.  But we would not propose to make any changes untilthey (ESA) have a more firm schedule in place.  As you know theyhave selected a contractor, but they have not negotiated theirprogram.  They're in the process of doing that.  There's somethings that could be done, some shifting of priorities, but wedon't think we can go much further in that activity until we get afirm commitment from them on when they can deliver their product.Something can be done, you have to make some trades.  You have togive up utilization flights or outfitting flights or things of thatnature.  But we don't propose to go any further until they arewilling to make a firm commitment on schedule."USER CONCERNSSSN: Looking at some of the user concerns, have there been anychanges with regard to the switch in the hab/lab modules as itrelates to the life science centrifuge facility?Moorehead: "We have met all the user requirements.  That's aninteresting story.  At the outset, I said that what we are tryingto introduce into this program is some discipline and rigor.There's a way to get requirements into this program...On thecentrifuge, the requirement is that we accommodate the 1.8 meterdiameter centrifuge and that we don't upset the microgravityenvironment onboard.  We can accommodate that centrifuge in eitherone of two places.  We can accommodate it in the lab or we canaccommodate it in a node.  The baseline's in the lab by now.  Andour analysis, and the Code E or the scientist people have concurredwith that analysis, is that yes indeed, we can meet themicrogravity requirement and have that centrifuge reside either inthe node or in the lab.  So we have met our requirements.  Nowthere's some things that have been published, some things that havebeen discussed in the media SPACE STATION NEWS, January 8, 1990that are not requirements in the program.  If they want to haveadditional requirements on the program, the process is come to theprogram with a change request.  They talk about location of thecentrifuge relative to hab or lab and animal storage facilities.They talk about growth of the centrifuge to a larger diameter, butthose things are not requirements.  They have not been written downand have not been written into the program.  The point I want tomake is that we have met all the requirements that have been statedthrough official channels.  We're here to serve the user and ifthey have other requirements and they're willing to state them,then we'll work those requirements."  (It should be noted that lifescience officials have said they were aware that some of theirconcerns had not actually been written formally into the program,but nonetheless were assumed to be available or provided.)SSN: So that switch in the placement of the hab and lab modules isa permanent thing?Moorehead: "As far as we're concerned...unless there's anotherrequirement that's accepted by the program that would cause us tochange that.  Yes, that is a permanent thing.  The other thing thatthey complained about is that in the rebaselined program theyalleged that we deleted some of the lab support equipment.  Numberone, we've added the lab support equipment back."SSN: Into whose budget?Moorehead: "It's in Station's budget.  There was some generalpurpose lab support equipment that was slated to be handled by theStation so we've added it back.  Now, the users are saying 'wearen't ready to define it.  It'll be '91 until we can tell you whatwe really want.'  So you might say we played poker and we calledtheir bluff and they're not ready to define what equipment theywant.  I'm saying that the Station proposes to provide $30 million,or whatever the dollar number was, of lab support equipment that atone time we had deleted, we propose now to add that back."SYSTEM CHANGESSSN: Have there been any major systems changes since theinformation on the new Station program was presented at thecongressional hearing last fall?Moorehead: "We decided before we formally baselined the assemblysequence to do away with the passive radiators (on the thermalcontrol system).  That was the last change in systems that we'vemade.  We have some ongoing studies.  We always have on-goingstudies.  There are two other changes that we are con-sidering...(One) of those being what I call growth of the power ofthe solar arrays such that we get additional power."SSN: At what stage in the process?Moorehead: "From the very beginning.  Increasing the capability ofeach power module by about 3 kilowatts.  So that would help theperceived power difficultly that we have.  At assembly completewe'd have 12 additional kilowatts of power, if we choose to dothat.  The other major change that's under the consideration isclosing that oxygen loop on the ECLSS.  That again was a block typething."  Under current Station plans, "for a while we transportoxygen to the Space Station and then just before assembly completewe would close the loop, if you will, and regenerate the oxygenonboard the Station.  Where now there is a proposal being(submitted) by the Marshall Space Flight Center that we move thatforward and close the loop and never do this block one thing thatsays transport oxygen to the Station.  Those are underconsideration, but they have not been made a part of the program."SSN: With regard to power, there has been considerable concern overpower levels available to users and additional reports (out of theReston Program Office that, with the international modules inplace), power levels may have actually dipped further.Moorehead: "Well let me say that I think you're confusing some factwith some opinion.  The baseline at assembly complete isessentially 30KW for the users and 45KW to operate the Station.Part of the Station operation, by the way, is power that we provideto the users just to keep their facilities alive.  In my personnelopinion, and this is opinion, is that the 45KW to operate theStation and keep the users alive is excessive and so what we willdo with that, and what we've always done on programs such as this,is that we scrub, we scrub, we scrub, we scrub...Now should we buythe additional 12KW that would be available if we grew the solar(arrays) then almost all of that could be dedicated to the user.And that decision is not a technical decision.  It'll be abudgetary decision, because certainly we can provide thatadditional 12KW without any significant technical risks at all.  Soif the agency makes the budgetary decision to fund the growth ofthe power modules by 3KW, then we have additional 12KW for theusers or whoever.  But there's nobody else that lays claim to it,so it would be user power."FUTURE CHALLENGESSSN: There have been a lot of changes out here in terms of theleadership of this program office in recent times.  Do you plan tobe around for a while and what do you see as the major challengeswhich you will face this year?Moorehead: "Well, (jokingly) I plan to be around for a while, but Ithink everybody would have given you that answer.  I did not takethis on as a short-term activity.  I enjoy this sort of work andit's sort of the only game in town.  So I plan to be here.  Interms of the short-term challenges, they relate to the very thingswe've been talking about.  And that is getting a good baselineestablished and getting the resources allocated.  We have manyresources to allocate across the program.  We talked about one--power.  And we've done power and we've done weight.  But we havevolume allocations to make, we have EVA (Extra-VehicularActivities) time allocations to make.  When we say that we can meetthe micro-g requirement--You start out if you had no disturbancesat all you would essentially have no accelerations, but you haveaccelerations onboard the vehicle.  So one of the things that(Station officials are working on) is to allocate how muchacceleration contributions can the Workpackage 3 elements make orthe Workpackage 2 elements and so forth.  So we have all thosesorts of resource allocations to make to set this program on a firmfooting so that we have a good set of ground rules.  And I thinkthat's a real challenge is to get the right ground rules, the rightrequirements in place.  And they're second level requirements...butthey're requirements that have to be in place before you can go cutmetal and build a real spacecraft."Back to Headline List WT03-B28-34IA059-000320-B037-57http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae15.html 205.156.212.5 19970114202544 text/html 10718HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:24:01 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:18 GMTContent-length: 10531Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae15.html Sample Issue Copyright SPEEDNEWS via NewsNet January 5, 1990 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEW & USED AIRCRAFT TRANSACTIONS AND COMPANY MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS.

The NPRM, which wasannounced last month, would base flight and duty limits on the amount oftime pilots and other crew members are on duty, rather than the currentsystem based on flight hours (BA, Dec. 18/263).   In a letter to FAA Administrator David Hinson, NATA President JamesCoyne noted that the NPRM culminates "over a decade's worth of debatebetween the FAA and the industry. We are disappointed that the FAA noticefailed to differentiate between the regulation of scheduled operators andthose providing on-demand transportation." Coyne asked Hinson to extendthe comment period - which was set at 90 days in the NPRM - by another 90days, noting that "in the absence of an emergency, and with theimportantance of the regulation, this would be a prudent action by theagency."   Coyne said NATA also "strongly recommends the FAA hold a series ofpublic meetings to gather information from those thousands of companiesthat will be affected by the proposal. We are shocked and dismayed thatthe FAA was unable to estimate the potential costs of the proposed rule onair taxi operators. In our view, the best method to gather thisinformation is for the FAA to hold regional meetings to examine the affectand the costs of the NPRM on this segment of the industry. NATA believesit is critical for the agency to take this step to meet its obligation tothoroughly analyze this important rulemaking action."Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEKLY OF BUSINESS AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 62, NoATLANTIC AVIATION SIGNS NEW PACT WITH WILMINGTON MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES   Atlantic Aviation Corp. said its maintenance personnel overwhelminglyratified a new labor agreement that extends into 1999. The new pact coverssome 200 technicians and maintenance personnel represented by the UnitedAuto Workers at Atlantic's principal maintenance facility and headquartersin Wilmington, Del. Those workers perform a wide range of maintenance,custom manufacturing, avionics installation, interior refurbishment andpainting of corporate aircraft.   Ben E. Waide, III, who took over as chairman and chief executive of thefixed-base chain in November (BA, Nov. 20/221), noted that thenegotiations, conducted after a long period of difficult restructuring byAtlantic, "were conducted with a mutual respect and a focus on continuedimprovement in the effectiveness and quality of our product." Theagreement, retroactive to Dec. 1, runs to March 1, 1999.   The previous agreement provided hourly workers with a 1.15 percent"supplemental bonus," but held wages at the same level and guaranteedcontinuation of "flexible work processes" that had been instituted in 1992(BA, May 24, 1993/203). In a telephone interview with BA last week, Waidesaid the new agreement is "extremely positive" because the negotiationsreflected an understanding by both sides of what needs to be done to keepthe business strong. In addition to maintaining the work flexibilityprovisions, he said the new pact provides a wage increase in each of thethree years and continues a "gain-sharing program" that increases paymentsto workers as profitability increases. Waide said both sides agreed toextend the termination date of the new agreement to March to avoid the end-of-year business and holiday distractions incumbent in a Decemberexpiration date.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEKLY OF BUSINESS AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 62, NoLAMBERT TAKES OVER TOP JOBS AT AVIALL FOLLOWING TAYLOR'S DEPARTURE   Robert G. Lambert, 65, who headed Dallas-based Aviall for nearly 20years until his retirement three years ago, has taken over as president andchief executive of the company. Aviall said he replaced Marshall B.Taylor, who, the company said, "resigned to pursue other interests."   Lambert led Aviall, Inc. and its predecessor companies from August 1973until December 1992, when he became a consultant to Ryder System'sworldwide aviation services. One year later he was named board chairman ofAviall, Inc., when that entity was spun off from Ryder System, Inc. Hewill now hold all three titles.   Lambert said Aviall "is continuing to study various strategicalternatives to improve shareholder return and better position the companyfor the future." He added that "Aviall's performance since it was spun offfrom Ryder System has been disappointing to the board and Aviall'sshareholders. We intend to focus management's attention on these matterswhile continuing our strategic evaluation of Aviall's business."   Aviall claims to be the largest distributor of parts and supplies andthe largest independent provider of maintenance and overhaul services forcommercial aviation turbine engines. The company said it had $863 millionin sales in 1994. A spokesman said Aviall expects total 1995 revenues ofapproximately $850 million, with the decline reflecting some discontinuedproduct lines. Through the first nine month of 1995 Aviall reportedrevenues of $647.5 million and net income of $8.5 million, or 44 cents pershare. Aviall has approximately 3,000 employees, including more than 1,200in the Dallas area and another 700 at a major overhaul facility inPrestwick, Scotland.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEKLY OF BUSINESS AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 62, NoERA COMPLETES PURCHASE OF ALASKA HELICOPTERS ASSETS   ERA Aviation, Inc., Anchorage, Alaska, said it completed the purchase ofcertain assets of Alaska Helicopters, Inc. for approximately $10 million.ERA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rowan Companies, Inc., Houston, Tex.,said the purchases includes the hangar and office space adjacent to ERA'sexisting facilities at Anchorage International Airport, 15 Bell helicoptersand related spare parts.

Coyne, his wife, Holly, and threechildren were about 25 miles from Hayden Airport enroute to a ski vacationwhen the engine blew, covering the right cowling with oil. "It's notsomething you like to see, when the oil pressure drops to zero," Coynesaid, "and it drops real fast."   The engine failed when the Baron was at 11,000 feet enroute to the6,602-foot airport and Coyne said he was thankful the problem did not arise30 miles earlier in the flight when the aircraft was over terrain higherthan the Baron's single-engine service ceiling. As it was, the landing wasrelatively uneventful, Coyne said, noting the "severe clear" conditionsthat prevailed, the airport's 10,000 foot runway and his belief that"Barons fly real well" on one engine. Another positive factor was the factCoyne had completed an instrument recurrency check just four weeks earlierthat included engine-out practice. He said the engine failure apparentlywas caused when a piece of cylinder ring broke off and wedged between acylinder and the piston wall.   Contacted by BA in Steamboat Springs, Coyne said last week's incident isthe second time in 20 years he's experienced an engine failure in hisBaron, adding that his entire family was aboard on both occasions. It isalso the second time this year Coyne will have had to leave his airplanebehind for repairs when he returns home. His Baron was partially coveredby flood waters while parked at the airport in New Orleans during NATA'sconvention there last spring, which necessitated extensive repairs andrepainting (BA, May 15/207).Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEKLY OF BUSINESS AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 62, NoROLLS-ROYCE NAMES NEW SENIOR EXECUTIVES   British engine maker Rolls-Royce will institute a number of executivechanges over the next several months, including installation of a new chiefexecutive.

The advisory followed incidents in whichseveral types of GPS receivers experienced position signals that were inerror by as much as 20 to 40 nautical miles. The Defense Department's GPSJoint Program Office (JPO) said the problem was caused by "corrupted datain the receiver and can occur when crypto keys....are loaded into anunkeyed receiver." While the encryption key problem would not affectcivilian users, sources who support retaining a backup for GPS say themilitary experience shows that something might go wrong and leave only deadreckoning as an alternative if FAA carries out plans to phase out all othertypes of navigation aids. The JPO said it is "aggressively investigatingother possible scenarios that can corrupt the data resulting in navigationerrors with no warning."   "This problem is specific to the military, but we are saying somethingelse might go wrong" that would impact civil users, a source said. "Thisis an instance in the military arena where something could go wrong, and itdid. The message is that a complementary or auxiliary system is needed incase something does go wrong." The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association,the National Association of State Aviation Officials and several otherindustry and user groups have pleaded with DOT - to no avail - to keepfunding the Loran C navigation system. DOT's latest FederalRadionavigation Plan calls for eliminating Loran C funding after 2000.Previous FRPs called for Loran C funding to 2015.   Richard Arnold, who leads the integrated product team for GPS andnavigation at FAA, and Joe Dorfler, product leader for GPS at the agency,said they have been aware "for some time" of the problem the military ishaving. Dorfler said the Wide Area Augmentation System, scheduled to becommissioned in 1998, will alert airmen if GPS signals are not to betrusted. He said that before WAAS is available, FAA-certified GPSreceivers will have receiver autonomous integrity monitoring as anaugmentation.   Arnold said FAA is "working on a gradual schedule. We will beabsolutely assured that the system we will put together will be robust andwill be backed up by ground-based navaids." Arnold acknowledged that LoranC and nondirectional beacons are to be phased out in 2000, "but we willstill have the VOR system and the ILS, which do not show phaseout until2010." Arnold said, however, that "if WAAS proves out, we may accelerateall that transition. But we are not going to do anything until the [airtraffic control] system is equally as safe as it is now, and we think itwill be better." In a widely circulated message to military commands, theJPO said GPS "provides the most useful and accurate navigation solutionavailable, but we caution operators not to be overconfident in the system.Appropriate cross-check of GPS with other forms of navigation (inertialnavigation sets, radar, radio navaids, Doppler, dead reckoning, visualmethods, etc.) should be employed to ensure safety and missionaccomplishment."Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEKLY OF BUSINESS AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 62, NoFAA EXTENDS COMMENT PERIOD FOR INSTRUCTOR, SCHOOL REGULATIONS   Federal Aviation Administration has extended until Feb. 12 the commentperiod for proposed regulations for pilot, flight and ground instructor,and pilot school certification (BA, Aug. 14/67).

FAA will spend about $2million in the Atlanta area for temporary duty personnel, overtime,security enhancements and installation and operation of four mobile airtraffic control towers from July 15 through Aug. 9. An additional 75employees will be on temporary duty before and during the Olympics. FAAexpects a 25 percent increase in air traffic in the Atlanta area during theevent.   FAA will operate temporary ATC services at six general aviation airportsand implement a reservation system for general aviation aircraft operationsthroughout the Atlanta metropolitan area. VFR arrival slot reservationswill be required at five airports, and non-scheduled IFR arrival/departureslot reservations will be required at 13 airports. FAA will establishrestricted airspace over Olympic venues and publish VFR helicopter routesabout six months before the Olympics.   The helicopter navigation project, known as the Atlanta Short HaulTransportation System, is a joint initiative of FAA, the HelicopterAssociation International and other industry groups, a number of localbusinesses and various agencies, including NASA and the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency. FAA will set up landing zones and routes to accommodateincreased demand for short-haul air transportation, such as emergencymedical services and express package delivery.   In addition to anticipated large numbers of helicopters that willoperate by VFR only during the Olympics, about 50 helicopters will use theGlobal Positioning System to navigate through this route structure. Usingdata link, movement of the specially equipped helicopters will be monitoredby a personal computer-based system. The helicopter routes will beestablished over interstate and multi-lane highways and will be designed toavoid residential areas. Half of the $10 million cost of the demonstrationprogram will be borne by FAA and the remainder divided among otherparticipants in the program. FAA estimates that the system will have aneconomic impact in the area of $15 million to $19 million.   Plans for security include a "Security Command Center" at FAA's SouthernRegion office in Atlanta to coordinate aviation security efforts withairports near venue sites, which are located in several states. FAA alsorecently approved $1.2 million in Airport Improvement Program funds for 11security enhancements at Hartsfield Atlanta Airport.

In August, rumors of a merger between Pratt &Whitney and fellow engine maker Rolls-Royce resurfaced, but both deniedthat such a move was underway. Asked last month whether a shrinking defensemarket would drive UTC to other fields, David said the company has beenheavily involved in defense for many years, adding that, "we have nointention of not being right smack in the middle of that. Armed conflictis going to be in our future."   Rather than selling the two business units, David said "it might even benice if we could make an acquisition or two or three," adding that the anysuch addition would have to be a good fit for UTC. He said he wouldconsider acquisitions in either the engine or helicopter business, addingthat the main obstacle to date has been a lack of candidates.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE WEEKLY OF BUSINESS AVIATION via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   Vol. 62, NoPETITIONS FOR EXEMPTION; SUMMARY AND DISPOSITION   Summary: Pursuant to FAA's rulemaking provisions governing theapplication, processing, and disposition of petitions for exemption (14 CFRPart 11), this notice contains a summary of certain petitions seekingrelief from specified requirements of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14CFR Chapter I), dispositions of certain petitions previously received, andcorrections.

Boeing reported orders totaling261 aircraft valued at $18 billion, compared to Airbus's total of 106orders with a total value of $7 billion.     The 1995 orders are in contrast to a much more comparable figurefor 1994. In that year, Airbus received slightly more orders, 125,valued at $9.1 billion, than Boeing, which received 120 orders with avalue of $7.8 billion.     Boeing's 1995 deliveries also were nearly double that of Airbus.Boeing completed and delivered 206 commercial aircraft to customers,while Airbus delivered 124 aircraft to 30 customers. However, Airbussales in 1995 totaling $9.6 billion were a one-year record for theEuropean aircraft consortium.     The sales increase was due primarily to a higher proportion ofwidebody aircraft deliveries, principally the A330 and A340, 49 ofwhich were delivered, 15 more than in 1994. The number of deliveriesof A320 and A321 aircraft increased to 56, while 19 A300s and A310widebodies also were delivered. The number of Airbus operatorsincreased from 123 to 131 in 1995.     Among the orders received by Airbus in 1995, 81 were for theA319/320/321 family; 19 were for A330/A340 aircraft, and 6 were forA300s/A310s. New Airbus customers included Midway Airlines, TACAInternational; Air Jamaica; Aer Lingus and Yemenia Airways.     At the end of 1995, Airbus had an order backlog of 578 aircraftvalued at $46.4 billion. Of 1,935 total Airbus orders from 122customers in the consortium's history, 1,357 have been delivered.     Boeing's total of 206 deliveries in 1995 includes 36 aircraft inthe fourth quarter, which was lower than anticipated due to itsmachinists' strike. The fourth quarter's 36 deliveries consisted ofnine 737s, five 747s, four 757s, twelve 767s and six 777s. For theyear, Boeing delivered eighty-nine 737s, twenty-five 747s, forty-three757s, thirty-six 767s and thirteen 777s.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996TAIWANESE COMPANY PLANS PANAMANIAN AIRLINE     A Taiwanese airline company plans to begin an intercontinentalairline in Panama, sources say. Evergreen Marine Corp., which foundedEva Airways, will boost its involvement in Panama in part because ofthe confidence Evergreen Chairman Chang Jung-fa has in the Panamaniangovernment, the sources tell World Airline News. Chang was named aninvestment adviser to Panamanian President Ernest Perez Balladareslast year.     The airline is expected to begin international service fromPanama by July, the sources say. Equipment being considered for theventure include 767 and 757 equipment from Boeing and A340 and A330aircraft from Airbus Industrie.     Eva has applied with Panamanian authorities to begin an airlinethat will fly to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia, sourcessay, adding that the airline has long-term plans to operate to theU.S., Europe and Asia. Eva also has asked Panama's incumbentinternational airline, copa, to become a minority shareholder, thesources say, but has not yet received any response. The offer was madein November.     Eva Airways now operates long-haul service from Taipei to LosAngeles and last year began linking that daily trip with Panama. Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996AIRBUS BEGINS 1996 WITH FLURRY OF AIRCRAFT ORDERS     Airbus Industrie launched 1996 with a surge of orders from fourcustomers. Philippine Airlines had by far the largest order of thefour -- 24 aircraft, including four long-range A340-300 widebodies, 8A330-200 twin-engine widebodies, and 12 A320 narrowbody planes. Theorders make it only the second airline in the world to have orderedthese three Airbus types.     Delivery of PAL's Airbus aircraft begin in the second quarter of1997, with nearly simultaneous delivery of the first A340 and A330.The first A320 will be delivered in the third quarter of 1997. PAL hasan additional four A340s from a previous order, which get delivered toPAL at the end of 1996.     The airline plans to use the new A340s to develop its long-haulroute system, including new nonstops to Europe and North America,Airbus says. A330s will be used on high-density Asian services and onmedium-to-long range routes as far away as the Middle East.     PAL also ordered eight 747-400 aircraft from Boeing valued at$2.7 billion.     Caribbean carrier BWIA International Airways ordered two A340-300aircraft, Airbus said Jan. 3, becoming the first Caribbean/LatinAmerican customer for the four-engine aircraft. The aircraft will bedelivered to BWIA in late 1996. BWIA also receives its first two A320narrowbodies in June.     Yemen's Yemenia Airways ordered two A310-300 aircraft and tookoptions on an additional two, becoming a new Airbus customer. Deliveryof the two aircraft is planned for March 1997. Yemenia will use theaircraft on nonstop services to Europe, southeast Asia and the U.S.,as well as on regional routes. The airline will have the airplanesconfigured to 191 passengers in three classes of service. Choice ofengines has not been made.     Airbus's fourth customer, leasing concern GATX Capital Corp.,ordered nine A321-200 aircraft, the stretched version of the A320narrowbody. The order was valued by Airbus at $580 million. Deliveriesof the -200, a higher performance version of the -100, begin in April1997.

"The regulatory work to reshape Europeanair transport is only half finished," says Bammer. "The time has cometo complete the task, with a genuine effort to remove the remainingconstraints which are keeping costs up, and efficiency down."     Noting that all three "packages," or phases, of European airlineliberalization measures have now been implemented, Bammer said, "theindustry is standing with one leg inside the single market, while oneleg is still out in the world of inter-governmental politicalwrangling."     Bammer adds, "The politicians have the opportunity to createeffective regulatory bodies out of the JAA [Joint AirworthinessAuthorities] and Eurocontrol [the European ATC system]. JAA issupposed to become the European counterpart of the respected anddemocratically-controlled FAA in the USA." The agency, however, hesays, "has only recently begun its rulemaking task, but already it isbogged down in bureaucratic muddle and institutional delays, whiledemocratic control and decision-making is not forthcoming."     In addition, Eurocontrol has never received the power from thevarious European states over which it is supposed to have airspacecontrol. Bammer says, "I agree with those directors-general in ECAC[European Civil Aviation Conference] who believe that the know-how ofEurocontrol -- and JAA -- should be combined with the decision-makingmechanisms of the European Union. Ultimately," he says, "we would seean agency of the European Union, respecting of course the rights ofnon-EU member states."     And Bammer criticized recent decisions to delay liberalization ofairport ground handling services which, he says, "shows how muchairports are regarded as pieces in the political game.     "The airports which enjoy monopoly handling, with the guaranteedincome that this means, make profits that the airlines can only dreamabout. Not only are we overcharged, we are also prevented fromtailoring our product to our customers' liking."     Bammer, who recently marked 30 years of service at Austrian, hasbeen closely involved with AEA since he was named president ofAustrian in 1992. He was chairman of the group's Commercial AffairsCommittee when it introduced the AirPlus credit card. He alsoconducted the AEA Global Distribution Study, which resulted in thelaunching of the Amadeus and Galileo computer reservations systems.     Bammer succeeds Roger Sietzen, president of Luxair. Sietzen usedhis presidency to promote development of European aviationinfrastructure, speaking widely on the topic throughout Europe in1995. "Under Seitzen's guidance," says AEA Director-General Karl HeinzNeumeister, "frequent contacts with [European Union] TransportCommission Neil Kinnock have been established, and the debate oninfrastructure has been brought firmly into the political arena."     Two AEA studies were published in 1995, "European Airports --Getting to the Hub of the Problem, or the Problem of Getting to theHub," and "EU External Aviation Relations -- an AEA Policy Statement."     Late in 1995, AEA attempted to break a deadlock on development ofstricter flight and duty-time rules for cockpit crews but was unableto persuade senior officials in the Joint Airworthiness Authorities toconsider the document.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996AEA REPORTS 7.7% GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN NOVEMBER     Growth in North Atlantic and Europe-Sub Saharan African marketshighlighted November's international traffic statistics for Europeancarriers, the Association of European Airlines reported last week.Traffic to sub-Saharan Africa grew by 15.6% to 2.407 billion revenuepassenger kilometers (RPKs), with capacity in the market growing atonly an 11.7% pace. Load factor, therefore, jumped 2.4 points to70.8%.     The statistics indicate continued strong growth in trafficrecovery by Europe's largest airlines, in contrast to a much smallerlevel of growth among U.S. carriers that serve international markets.Only one international market shrank in November -- the Mid-Atlantic.Traffic in that market decreased 2.9% to a total 1.427 billion RPKs,but capacity rose 5.5%, so load factor dropped 5.9 points to 66.2%.     In total, European airlines flew 23.429 billion RPKs in November,up 7.7%, while capacity rose only 6.5%, to 42.215 billion availableseat kilometers (ASKs). Load factor rose slightly, by 0.8 points, to65%.     For January-November 1995, traffic also rose at a 7.7% pacecompared to the same 11-month period in 1994. Total international RPKswere 344.598 billion, and ASKs rose 5.6% to 487.482 billion. Loadfactor increased 1.4 points to 70.7%.     Traffic in North Atlantic and Sub-Saharan Africa markets outpacedall others for the first 11 months, showing increases of 9% and 9.4%,respectively.

Jack Foley, 42, will be responsible for the airline's passengersales and marketing efforts in the continent and will report to DavidBunworth, Aer Lingus's Dublin-based director of sales and marketing.     Foley comes from British Airways, where he was involved in keyaspects of the successful airline's sales, marketing and informationmanagement areas for 21 years.     "Aer Lingus regards North America as a key market for furtherdevelopment," says Bunworth. "This developing market requires dynamicmanagement at this critical time."Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996BRITISH AIRWAYS OUTLINES PAY INCREASE PROPOSALS     British Airways has proposed a 3.1% raise over two years forunionized workers in ground services, cabin crew, and specialized"craft" and "non-craft" areas, such as maintenance and engineering. Ifaccepted by unions, the two-year raise would be retroactive to Jan. 1.The offer also makes some changes to the airline's profit-sharingformula and to basic pensions.     Harvey May, BA's director of human resources, says, "BritishAirways' pay rates for many jobs are in the top 10, or 25%, for similarwork in other UK companies. Although the airline is currently enjoying asuccessful period, it is vital not to build in permanent costs thatincrease the difficulty of any future business decisions when times arenot so good."     May was quoted in most recent issue of BA News, the airline'semployee newspaper.   The airline's approach to pay rates,he says, "is to protect against inflation and to tackle any issues ofmarket comparability when they arise separately from the two-year payagreement."     Profit-sharing arrangements for the 1995-96 fiscal year, BA says,predict that the average employee will receive 3.75 weeks of pay inprofits. As an example, an individual earning Pounds 310 per week orbelow will receive a lump sum payment of Pounds 1,162. If they choose toinvest the funds in BA stock, however, the contribution rises to Pounds1,395, representing a 20% bonus this year.     Approximately 66% of BA staff are now company shareholders, BAestimates, with Pounds 66 million distributed in shares last year, athreefold increase from the year before.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996ROUTE DEVELOPMENTS     * Greece's Olympic Airways and Brazilian carrier VASP launchedcodesharing services between the two countries Jan. 4.

Roy Hagerty, a 25-year industry veteran, replaces Barry Harris, aformer acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, whodecided to return to his consulting business in Washington after lessthan two months with the fledgling firm.   It was the second such leadership change at Independence Air. BeforeHarris, the Department of Transportation indicated to the company thatthe appointment of Stephen Quinto, one of the airline's founders, wouldbe controversial due to the bankruptcy of his last airline,Northeastern, in 1982.   Hagerty, who most recently served as president of AirlineDevelopment Group, a consulting firm based in Raleigh, N.C., says thecompany needs some $6 million in startup funds to get off the ground.The company is still looking at Airbus A300B4 aircraft, which can carrysome 270 passengers depending on configuration, but also is a good cargoaircraft.   Before his job at Airline Development Group, Hagerty was chairman,president and CEO of CCAIR, Inc., a U.S. regional airline that operatedas Piedmont Commuter and later USAir Express. Hagerty grew the businessfrom a money-losing effort in 1983 to a $60 million firm that reportedprofits of $4 million in 1991. Before CCAir, Hagerty ran Coastal Air,which operated Southeastern Airlines, from 1972 to 1983.   Hagerty told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week that heplans to hire several former Eastern Airlines officials who had recentlyleft Independence Air after Harris resigned.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD AIRLINE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996ATA PREDICTS FIRST U.S. AIRLINE PROFIT SINCE 1989   U.S. airlines should report an annual profit for 1995, their firstsince 1989, the Air Transport Association reported last week. A growingeconomy, high air fares, limited sales and low fuel prices were themajor contributors, ATA says.   "1995 was a good year for U.S. airlines, and it came just at a timewhen the industry needed a good year," said ATA President Carol Hallett."After five long years of losses totaling $13 billion, airlines needprofits to repair balance sheets, buy new aircraft and get ready for the21st century." Hallett said 1996 looks "hopeful" if the economy remainshealthy, if airline unions cooperate on cost-saving proposals, "and ifthe government tax collector keeps his hand out of the industry'spocket."   However, Hallett's words seem somewhat hollow after last week'sevents concerning the U.S. ticket tax. The 10% excise tax on all ticketsexpired on Jan. 1 after Congress was unable to enact a new lawcontinuing the tax. At first, U.S. airlines simply pocketed theadditional money; however, they began dropping fares by a commensuratelevel later in the week. By the end of the week, nearly all large U.S.airlines had passed the savings associated with the tax on to consumers.   ATA said a record 548 million passengers boarded U.S. carriers in1995, a 3.7% increase over 1994's total of 528 million. Revenuepassenger miles totaled 540 billion, up 4%, and passenger load factorsaveraged 67%, a post-World War II record. Preliminary data show thatcargo traffic increased a healthy 11%, to 15.2 billion ton miles, whilemail shipments grew at a 4.5% pace to 2.4 billion ton miles.   For the first three quarters, U.S. airlines reported net income ofapproximately $2.2 billion. Noting that Wall Street projections call fora break-even fourth quarter, "1995 year-end profits are likely to remainin the $2 billion range," ATA claimed.Back to Headline List WT03-B28-37IA059-000320-B037-175http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/ae09.html 205.156.212.5 19970114202817 text/html 31461HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:26:22 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:15 GMTContent-length: 31274Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ae09.html Sample Issue Copyright WORLD AIRPORT WEEK via NewsNet January 2, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES PENA APPROVES MAJORITY OF LAX LANDING FEE INCREASES (478 words) NEW YORK SEES SAVINGS IN OUTSOURCING (221 words) BAA AIRPORTS REPORT AVERAGE PASSENGER INCREASE OF 6.8% IN NOVEMBER (134 words) AFCO FINALIZING AIR CARGO PLANS WITH PITTSBURGH (180 words) N.Y.

TheDec. 22 decision could also reverberate in city halls across thecountry.     LAX has been involved in a series of disputes with carriers overthe legitimacy of certain landing fees. Airlines claim the fees are asubtle form of revenue diversion, in which airlines are forced to payfor some non-airport safety services. This is not allowed underfederal law. Pena's decision reinstates some services paid for byairline fees that carriers contend are not airport related.     Tensions concerning the decision were evident in statements madeby Airport Commission President Ted Stein, who was quoted by the L.A.Times as saying the airlines "basically conceded this time that theygot their butts kicked."     Carol Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association, whichrepresents U.S. airlines, appears to be in a fighting mood as well."The time has come for city hall to end its shenanigans," she says,claiming that by virtue of these landing fees, Los Angeles areacitizens are paying "hidden taxes." She says the DOT's decision "payslip service to the congressional mandate prohibiting cities. . .fromdiverting airport revenues to pay for general public services. We areleft with no choice but to go back to Congress for the second time inthree years to get this mess cleaned up."     Chris Chiames, spokesman for ATA, says his organization will tryto change the decision-making process to isolate it from politicalpressures, which Chiames believes influenced Pena. ATA also wants tostrengthen the language in federal laws that prevent revenue diversionto avoid similar situations from arising at other U.S. airports."There are dozens of cash-strapped cities and counties across thecountry" that might be tempted to follow in Los Angeles' footsteps,Chiames suggests.     The FAA's reauthorization bill will expire next fall, and Chiamesviews this occasion "as a vehicle to revisit the issue."     The airport's landing fees will be scaled back to $1.97 from thecurrent $2.06 per thousand pounds of landed weight. Another 29 centsis currently under dispute by the airlines, who continue "to pay thatamount while awaiting judicial resolution.     Pena's decision rejects part of an earlier ruling made byadministrative law judge Burton S. Kolko in late November. [WAW, Dec.5, 1995, p. 8] At that time, Kolko found 14 cents of the $2.06 landingfees unreasonable. Pena's decision, however, reinstated five cents ofthe amount in question. The airport must refund airlines thedifference between the $2.06 and $1.97 charges, which amounts to $4.6million. If all 14 cents of the landing fees had been disallowed, asthe airlines wanted, the airport would have been forced to refund $7.2million.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD AIRPORT WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996NEW YORK SEES SAVINGS IN OUTSOURCING     The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is turning toprivate industry to help reduce operating costs at NewarkInternational Airport, as part of an overall restructuring that willsave the Authority $105 million in 1996.      The Authority will expand the role of private developers inmanaging terminal concessions at Newark and increase the use ofprivate contractors and consultants to undertake design and managementof capital projects.

Construction at the airport has already begun, includingexpanding import and export facilities, as well as improving thecomputer system and security at the airport, says Infraero, thegovernment-owned handling company. Brazilian company Camargo Correa/Constram wasawarded the expansion contract, which is to be completed in April.      Significant strides have also been taken to improve cargohandling at the facility, although delays in cargo clearance stillexist. "I couldn't believe I was in the same airport," says MikeNenadovich, IATA facilities manager, days after his second visit toGuarulhos Airport. Nenadovich first visited the airport in April andwrote a scathing report on numerous problems there.      "The place was not busting at the seams," Nenadovich says, butInfraero has made strides to move and store cargo more efficiently. Itis the customs authority that continues to delay cargo, Nenadovichsays. Infraero now claims that 100% of cargo is checked into awarehouse within 12 hours of arrival. It is then turned over tocustoms.     The weak link is still MANTRA, Brazilian Customs's computersystem, he says. "You are unable to correct a typo on [airway billsrequired by customs]. You must make an appointment and the customsagent has to go in and fix it. The whole purpose of [electronic datainterchange] is to get it done and to get it done fast. Why have EDIif you have to make appointments to make changes?" he asks. Customsofficials admitted that some problems exist, Nenadovich says, notingthey would like IATA's help in improving the system. Nenadovich sayshe currently is reviewing possible system enhancements.      Although airline representatives at Guarulhos tell Nenadovichthey have lost business equaling more than 4,000 pounds of cargo toother area airports, he contends "the new management of Infraero hasdone a marvelous job." Cargo was not out on the ramp, as it was inApril. All cargo is now stored in a highly-secured warehouse and theairport has installed 60 computerized security cameras to monitor allactivity at the airport. A fence has been constructed around theairport, restricting all traffic to one entrance and exit andadditional off-airport facilities are being built to accommodatefreight forwarders, he adds. **********************************************************************             WORLD AIRPORT WEEK WANTS TO KNOW YOUR OPINION     World Airport Week wants you to be part of its end-of-yearsummary.

A browse through theNews Analysis sections of this and previous issues of AutomotiveComponents Analyst will reveal a wide range of references to takeoversand the establishment of joint ventures in these up and coming areas.The problem, though, is that progress is likely to be far from smoothand, like all forms of investment, timing is everything. A review ofthe automotive sector's recent fortunes indicates that - from acomponent supplier's standpoint - currently the Czech Republic andIndia are good places to be, but conditions are far less satisfactory(to put it at its mildest) in Mexico and Turkey. Who will be thewinners and losers in 1996 and in the run-up to 2000, and how longbefore a satisfactory payback is received from these new ventures?Meanwhile, individual component producers still have the potential toreap significant rationalisation benefits from making appropriate andopportune acquisitions in the West. The proposed takeover of theAmerican companies Gates Rubber and Thompson International by the UK-based groups Tomkins and McKechnie respectively - the former involvinga $1bn deal - together with a recent spate of acquisitions by UScorporations of European component manufacturing operations, areindicative of a gradual convergence of the two regions' componentmanufacturing sectors.Although there is long term promise in countries with developing motorindustries, there are sound reasons for believing that the majority ofcorporate action will be centred in the West during the coming year.Notwithstanding the cyclical nature of vehicle demand in America andEurope, these are the places - along with Japan - which generatetoday's volumes and profits.In addition, the major component groups realise that the key to futuresuccess rests on staying at the technological forefront in terms ofboth products and manufacturing. From that everything else will follow - including low prices and global reach. It could be, therefore, thatthe companies to watch are those who are manoeuvring themselves into aposition of commercial and technological pre-eminence in the markets oftoday to the exclusion of the markets of tomorrow.After all, in the interests of international competitiveness, novehicle manufacturer will be able to ignore the lowest prices whenthese are teamed up with the highest technical content. And thecontinuing process of components industry consolidation means thatthose who have failed to develop a wider global presence may be able toacquire it later on.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BOSCH EXPANDS IN CHINARobert Bosch has formed a 50/50 joint venture in China with Zhong-LionAutomotive Electronics Ltd (Shanghai) for the development, productionand marketing of electronic management systems for petrol engines.These will be manufactured under Bosch licence and sold with the Boschbrand.Bosch and Zhong-Lion plan to invest more than DM200m up to 2000, bywhich time it is envisaged that the venture will be employing about2,500 people and producing 1.2m engine management systems a year.The new company, to be known as United Automotive Electronic Systems CoLtd, will have its head office in Shanghai, while its manufacturinglocations will be based at Wuxi (Jiangsu Province) and Xi'an (ShensiProvince).The Bosch group already has a joint venture in China for themanufacture of diesel injection systems.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FEDERAL MOGUL PLANS CHINESE VENTURE FOR ENGINE BEARINGSFederal Mogul has established a joint venture with Shanghai AutomotiveIndustry Corporation for the production of engine bearings.

The operation is a specialist supplierof high grade, hot rolled strip, and the investment is targeted atproviding the latest technology to process and distribute highlycustomised, high quality products in the most cost effective manner.A new wide slitting line is being installed to improve productivity andflexibility, as well as provide a 40 per cent capacity increase. Theplant will be capable of handling 25 tonne coils in widths of up to1850mm with an increased gauge range from 1.5mm up to 8mm. The linewill also incorporate innovations to enable the service centre todiversify away from traditional products and process a wider range offerrous materials, including the new generation of high performancesteels which are being specified increasingly by automotive customers.The Church & Bramhall development is the second stage in a five yearplan whereby Firsteel Strip Mill Products is changing from being astockholder to a specialist service centre business. The strategy isbased on the trend for a growing percentage of steel to be routedthrough specialist processors rather than direct from producer to enduser - a development which is more and more evident in the automotivesector. This provides a solution to the contradictory needs of the bulksteel producer at one end of the spectrum and those of componentcustomers for smaller quantities of highly customised, quality assuredmaterial which is delivered just-in-time.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996JOHNSON CONTROLS FORMS JV TO PRODUCE AUTOMOTIVE BATTERIES IN CHINAJohnson Controls has teamed up with Shanghai Electrical to produceautomotive batteries in China.

This is linkeddirectly into Rover Group's computerised production schedule and ismaking fully assembled dashboards for the new Rover 200. It is thefirst example in the UK of a fully assembled dashboard being producedin modular form for direct assembly into the vehicle.Each dashboard is manufactured within a four hour timeframe, fromreceipt of the order by on-line computer to delivery of the finishedpart to the designated car as it progresses along the Rover 200assembly line at the nearby Longbridge plant. This process is designedto eliminate entirely unnecessary stocks of materials and components inthe supply chain. Marley manages the activities of 23 componentsuppliers to ensure that stocks do not build up in the supply chain.This first phase is now operational and has resulted in around 80 newjobs, and it is envisaged that there will be 200 employees at the newoperation as further products are introduced progressively during 1996.The next product to be introduced will be the assembled dashboard andinterior components for the recently launched Rover MGF sports car.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996T&N TO MANUFACTURE POWDER METAL COMPONENTS IN INDIAIn partnership with Goetze (India), T&N is establishing a joint ventureat Rajasthan, in India, for the manufacture of powder metal engine andtransmission components.

This operation used to be known as Champion South Africabut was divested in the latter part of the 1980s to become a Championlicensee and renamed Trichamp. The company will now be controlled by UK-based Champion Europe as part of its Africa and Middle East operations.It is estimated that Trichamp accounts for around 50 per cent of theSouth African replacement market for spark plugs and about 85 per centof the country's replacement market for wiper blades. There are 300employees and annual turnover amounts to approximately $20m.In line with the changed political circumstances, there is growinginterest on the part of American and European component producers overprospects for development in South Africa, but also a recognition thatsubstantial economic progress will be required before the car market'spotential is fulfilled.

This contractrepresents the first major extension of the company's traditionaldesign engineering role.FFD-Ricardo is to supply the assembly which connects the Prowler'sengine, driveline and transmission, and includes the casings anddriveshaft attachments for both bell housings. The company willmanufacture, assemble and supply the interfacing units, complete withinternal components and external attachments, direct from its Livoniafacility. Dana Corporation is also involved in the project and willsupply the driveshaft and interfacing rubber couplings.Chrysler has adapted its existing 4-speed automatic transaxle for theProwler's rear mounted position. Previously, the transverse unit hadbeen specified only for front wheel drive applications. The engineeringchallenge has been to develop a new driveline system for transferringtorque from the Prowler's front mounted 3.5-litre engine to its rearmounted transaxle. The driveline is designed to handle 300 Nm of torqueat 3100 rpm. It is also capable of handling power transmission atengine speeds in excess of 6400 rpm.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HOLLANDIA WEATHERSHIELDS WINS RUSSIAN ORDERHollandia Weathershields (the UK automotive sunroof manufacturer whichwas formerly known as Britax and is now owned by the Dutch companyVermeulen Hollandia) has won a contract valued at #200,000 a year froma major Russian automotive importer.

German police reportthat, of the 4,600 BMWs reported as stolen in the country during theten months to end-October 1995, only 109 were produced in 1995 comparedwith 938 thefts of 1994-produced cars during the same period. Moreover,the thefts of 1995 cars were attributed to fraud or other means such ashoisting on to a truck, as opposed to being driven off without the useof the vehicle's key.BMW's intelligent immobiliser is fully automatic and does not requireany intervention on the part of the driver. It is based on thetransponder principle with a coil shaped antenna around the ignitionlock and a microchip in the key handle. As the key is turned in thelock, the antenna takes on the role of a transformer and induces acertain voltage in the microchip. In turn, the microchip is activatedand verifies the code sequences. Once the key has been identified, adigitally coded signal is transmitted to the engine management systemwhich allows the engine to start.Each key is unique and is programmed and coded at the factory. Thetransponder memory of each key therefore has a permanent personal codeas well as a constantly changing random code with 100bn variants.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HELLA DEVELOPS NEW AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMHella has developed a new air conditioning system which offers theopportunity for the driver and front seat passenger to select differenttemperatures. These temperatures, moreover, can be maintained under allcircumstances, including intense sunlight. Hella devised the new systemfollowing research into interior car conditions which indicated thatthe ideal temperature for the driver and passenger was usuallydifferent. The driver, being "active" prefers cooler conditions whilethe resting passenger requires a warmer atmosphere.The advanced air conditioning unit operates by means of a "loop" basedsystem, comprising a main control loop which adjusts four maintemperatures, and secondary loops which provide the variations for theleft and right hand sides of the vehicle. Two photodiode sensorsmeasure intensity and direction of sunlight, and adjust very quicklythe inside temperatures as appropriate.The complexity of the system implies the potential for a significantmargin of error in manufacturing, with the result that Hella hasestablished stringent quality control standards. The company claimsthat there is likely to be only one defect in 14,000 units at the endof the vehicle assembly line. Current production amounts to 2,000 unitsa month.The first application is on the Audi A8. Steve Widdett - OE SalesManager at Hella Manufacturing - states that "in a comparison test, theA8 Hella air conditioning unit was judged the best by far.

These radiatorsincorporate technology developed by the International CopperAssociation. Made with thin gauge fins and tubes, they are up to 40 percent lighter than traditional copper-brass radiators. If conventionallyspray painted, radiators as thin and as light as this could beespecially vulnerable to corrosion. Indeed, laboratory tests havealways shown that conventional spray painting reduces corrosionresistance in radiators.But in tests conducted by Outokumpu Copper of Sweden with E-coatingsystems from ICI Electrocoat and PPG Industries, it is reported thatthe corrosion resistance of E-coated copper-brass radiators wasexceptional on all counts, even within seams and along sharp edges.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996ROCKWELL'S TWIN SPOILER SUNROOF FITTED TO MERCEDES-BENZ CONCEPT VEHICLEThe Mercedes-Benz AA Vision - the design concept of the All-ActivityVehicle (AAV) which was introduced at the recent North AmericanInternational Auto Show in Detroit - is equipped with a twin spoilersunroof supplied by Rockwell Automotive.

For example, as from January 1,1996, three year old catalyst-equipped cars will be subject to the UK'sMoT vehicle test.To meet this expected demand, Timax Exhaust Systems is introducing arange of replacement catalytic converters in the UK. Timax is a memberof TESH which already supplies a range of catalytic converters to theGerman and other markets, where cat-equipped cars were introducedduring the latter part of the 1980s.The Timax range in the UK is being produced with metallic monoliths andshells which are being sourced from Rosi in France and are beingassembled in recently extended facilities at the company'smanufacturing operation at Blackpool. This new facility is utilisingsmall batch cellular manufacturing techniques in order to provide afast response to customer demands in a market whose size is difficultto predict at present.For background information, TESH was established in 1993 and is theEuropean joint venture company of the North American group ArvinIndustries Inc and the Italian group Sogefi SpA. It incorporates theirreplacement exhaust manufacturing companies Ansa Marmitte of Italy(Sogefi), Rosi of France (Sogefi) and Timax UK (Arvin).

Each is capable of painting 3,500 filtercanisters per hour.The new lines, which replace the traditional methods of manualhandling, use a solvent-free, powder-coat paint and incorporate anetwork of sensors to integrate all elements of the painting process.Canisters are automatically loaded into the pre-treatment section wheretheir surfaces are degreased and prepared with phosphates to accept thepaint. In stage two, they are oven dried and transferred mechanicallyto the paint conveyor where the powder spray booths are mounted. Thesebooths are designed to maximise energy efficiency, and any excesspowder sprayed is reclaimed and re-used. The canisters are thentransferred automatically to the oven, which is the final section ofthe line.Crosland reports that the new process paints a cannister in little overfive minutes from start to finish.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996PILKINGTON ANNOUNCES NEW PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF MIRRORSPilkington has announced a "revolutionary advance" in the manufactureof mirrors. The new product range - to be known as Pilkington Reflex -is manufactured by a process which dispenses with conventional off-linesilvering techniques and enables a reflective surface to be applied asthe glass itself is being manufactured on the float line.Pilkington Reflex gains its reflectivity from a multi-layer sandwich ofultra-thin silicon and silica coatings, as opposed to the conventionalreflective metallic film. The coatings are applied by means of aprocess known as chemical vapour deposition, which is carried outcontinuously on the float glass as it moves at a speed of a few hundredmetres per hour. Several layers are formed, with each layer having athickness accuracy of just a few atoms.The new technology will enable Pilkington to supply mirror productswhich are toughened, bent or laminated - in similar manner to uncoatedfloat glass - and there will be far less susceptibility to damageduring the manufacturing process.It is expected that the application of Pilkington Reflex will beespecially appropriate where mirrors are required to withstand harshand humid conditions, and will therefore be particularly applicable forthe automotive industry. As a consequence of the materials used,mirrors produced with the new technique will not deteriorate at theedges, as occurs with conventionally silvered mirrors.There are environmental benefits too during manufacturing, since theuse of chemicals is reduced and no precious metals or lead-basedbacking paints are needed.At the announcement in mid-January, Glen Nightingale - Director ofPilkington, technology and manufacturing - stated that PilkingtonReflex "revolutionises the way mirrors are made (and) will find use inall segments of the substantial mirror market".For the record, it is estimated that the worldwide market for glassmirrors amounts to 110m sq m a year, which makes the sector the thirdlargest end-use of flat and safety glass after construction andautomotive.

At present, the company has 50manufacturing plants, 13 customer service centres and three technicalcentres in the region.Delphi reports that its commitment to ISO9000 has resulted in many morebenefits than initially anticipated. For example, in addition tomeeting a minimum quality system, implementing the standard has helpedDelphi to increase its quality focus and foster closer relationshipswith its customers. Moreover, the adoption of an internationallyrecognised quality standard has facilitated faster and more effectiveintegration with customers' quality systems and has saved time andmoney during quality audits.The standardised framework is also helping to harmonise quality systemswithin Delphi and to improve communications between sites anddisciplines.Delphi's next objective is to develop standard quality policy manualsfor each of the three types of operation - manufacturing site, customerservice centre and technical centre.

Evenso, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the traditional rigidpattern is breaking down at the edges, with the result that "outsiders"should not give up their attempts to break into the market.One of the most significant developments recently has been Nissan'sdecision to award a supply contract to Aisin Seiki, a member ofToyota's family of component companies. This has been based apparentlyon quality and cost considerations, and is a natural consequence of theneed to seek out all possible means of maintaining a grip in aninternational marketplace where competition is intensifyingremorselessly.The Japanese are facing a combination of factors which means that pastrelationships will count for little if higher cost savings are to befound elsewhere. Leaving aside political and currency factors (whichalone are sufficient to jettison old habits) Japanese vehicle producersface the twin squeeze of resurging American and European automotivesectors - which are not only producing a new generation of freshlystyled models to a high quality, but also implementing massive costcutting programmes - and developing industries in low cost areas,chiefly in neighbouring Far Eastern countries.European component groups inclined to try their luck with Japanesevehicle producers should go to the JAMA-CLEPA conference (see page 11)and listen as well as talk.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996PRICES - AGAINThe purchasing seminar at the recent World Congress in Detroit,organised by "Automotive News", provided fresh evidence that componentproducers - wherever they are based - will face unprecedented pressureson their margins over the next few years.

BMW, for example, is looking for cost cutsof 25-30 per cent for the next 3-series, while Chrysler does not intendto sanction any price increases for components during 1996 and islooking for savings of $1bn in the medium term.Despite the well publicised rough ride received by Ford at its round ofsupplier meetings during 1995, it is hard to avoid the conclusion thatvehicle manufacturers are well placed to have their demands satisfied.The establishment of global supplier bases means that companies such asFord and General Motors are devising the means to identify and sourcefrom companies which have the lowest cost structures and/or willingnessto shave margins to the minimum.Moreover, this ability is spreading throughout the industry asglobalisation proceeds apace. Take BMW, for example, which untilrecently could be classified as a fairly parochial German player withregard to manufacturing and sourcing. Now it owns Rover Group in the UKand has a developing commitment to manufacturing in America, both ofwhich will facilitate the potential to break free from thestraightjacket of German component sourcing.Back to Headline List WT03-B28-39IA059-000320-B037-318http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/au15.html 205.156.212.5 19970114203039 text/html 119611HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:28:33 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:37 GMTContent-length: 119423Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/au15.html Sample Issue Copyright AUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES SPEED SENSE (756 words) BRAZIL RETAINS FUEL-ALCOHOL PROGRAMME (114 words) NATURAL GAS HEAVY-DUTY ENGINE MEETS ULEV STANDARDS (198 words) FUEL CELL VEHICLE HITS THE MARKET (265 words) NATURAL GAS VEHICLE WINS AWARD (72 words) GAS BUSES FOR SOUTHAMPTON (116 words) JAPAN HELPS THAILAND WITH FUEL TESTING AND SPECIFICATION (102 words) MOBIL LAUNCHES CLEANER DIESEL (84 words) GENERAL MOTORS PUNISHED FOR POLLUTING CADILLACS (412 words) PARTICULATE REDUCTION SYSTEMS ON TRIAL IN LONDON BUSES (129 words) MEXICO CITY TIGHTENS CAR CONTROLS (216 words) PUBLICATIONS REVIEW CHINA'S POLLUTION PROBLEMS WORSEN (142 words) CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY (387 words) SOLECTRIA SUNRISE CONTINUES TO IMPRESS (181 words) EV TRIALS IN WESTMINSTER (146 words) ALUMINIUM USE ON THE INCREASE (74 words) IMCO EXPANDS ALUMINIUM CAPABILITIES (149 words) JOHNSON CONTROLS USES RECYCLED DRINK BOTTLES TO MAKE SEATS (189 words) FIAT TO EXPAND RECYCLING OFFER (132 words) NEWS ZEXEL DEVELOPS MEMBRANE TO IMPROVE ENGINE FUEL EFFICIENCY (42 words) GREENPEACE DESIGNS CAR (414 words) NEW ROVER 200 SERIES CARS DESIGNED FOR FUEL EFFICIENCY (491 words) US 55 MPH SPEED LIMIT ABOLISHED (145 words) OECD RECOMMENDS THAT CANADA RAISE TRANSPORT TAXES (204 words) THAI GOVERNMENT TO CRACK DOWN ON MOTORCYCLES (99 words) EC VEHICLE RECYCLING DIRECTIVE THIS YEAR (118 words) LOBBYING INCREASES ON US NLEV PROGRAMME (247 words) PUBLICATIONS REVIEW IMPLICATIONS OF TRANSPORT POLICY FOR ENGINEERING INDUSTRY (273 words) IPCC RE-AFFIRMS BELIEF IN GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE (183 words) AA: RESPONSE TO THE GREAT TRANSPORT DEBATE (338 words) CONFERENCE REPORT BODY AND CHASSIS INNOVATIONS (6437 words) STEEL THREATS AND RESPONSES (1138 words) AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT (3002 words) PUZZLING BUDGET (236 words) SOAP STORY (248 words) CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SPEED SENSEThe control of vehicle speed is an emotive issue for most motorists.Increasingly, though, the effective regulation of speeds is seen as atool for making better use of the road system, reducing accident ratesand limiting the environmental impacts of car use.After a hard-fought battle between the pro and anti lobbies, PresidentClinton signed the bill that ended the 55 mph (88 km/h) national speedlimit in the US. Individual states are now free to set their own limitsor, indeed, to have none. The national limits, thoroughly unpopular inwestern and southern states, were set by Congress in 1973 as an energyconservation and safety measure. The most worrying facet of theabolition of the national speed limits was that the environmentalimplications of speed merited barely a sentence in the congressionaland public debates on the issue. The discussion focused almostexclusively on safety concerns.Speed is an important factor in determining the emissions from a car.Essentially, a vehicle is at its least polluting (per mile travelled)when it is travelling at a constant speed of around 45 mph (72 km/h).As the speed moves away from this value and/or the journey becomesstop/start in nature, emissions tend to increase. Specifically, asspeeds rise above 55 mph, the environmental implications aresignificant:* a vehicle travelling at 65 mph (105 km/h) emits 100% more carbonmonoxide than the same vehicle travelling at 55mph, as well as 50% morehydrocarbons and 31% more nitrogen oxides;* passenger cars and light trucks use about 50% more fuel travelling at75 mph (121 km/h) than they do at 55 mph. This translates directly intoincreased CO2 emissions.Despite the clear implications of increased speeds for emissions of CO2and toxic pollutants, the protagonists in the US debate talked only ofsafety and their concerns over security of oil supply. This narrowvision seems all the stranger for a nation that has a history ofadopting the most stringent vehicle emissions legislation in the world.Moreover, the debates came as the Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange were re-confirming their belief that global climate change ishappening and that action is required to reduce CO2 emissions.Of course, no one is pretending that the 55 mph speed limit was beingobeyed police tended not to stop drivers doing 10 mph greater than thespeed limit anyway and the law was often described as the most floutedin America. In general, research shows that without stringentenforcement, drivers travel at whatever speed they feel comfortablewith, regardless of official speed limits. In this sense, bad speedlimits can be defined as those that are poorly enforced.The abolition of the national speed limit in the US comes at aninteresting time for speed discussions. Throughout Europe, attitudes tospeed limits and controls are changing. In the UK, the M25 has recentlybecome the subject of a controlled motorway trial with variable speedlimits employed in an attempt to make better use of the road space.Message signs are used to show a mandatory speed limit depending ontraffic levels measured by underground sensors. The preliminary resultsshow smoother traffic flows and reduced delays with a consequentreduction in fuel use and emissions.At a European level, legislation was introduced recently to fit speed-governors that physically limit the speed of coaches and heavy trucks.Even in Germany, the no limit rule on the Autobahns was recentlyreviewed as the country was hit by episodes of high pollution. Indeed,the absence of a German speed limit is currently the subject of a legalchallenge from an environmental transport group.By combining the intelligent use of speed limits with developments inareas such as obstacle sensors and route guidance, the future holdsgenuine gains in terms of improving the efficiency with which the roadnetworks can be used. As the American experience shows, any speedregulation must be accompanied by effective enforcement technologicaldevelopments such as speed cameras and radar systems provide the meansfor such a system to exist. Providing speed regulation does not end upmerely stimulating more traffic, thereby recreating the originalcongestion, there are clear environmental and operational benefitsavailable.Whatever individual states decide to do with their new-found speedlimit powers, the quality of debate exhibited in the USA seems toindicate that Europe is genuinely a step ahead in terms ofunderstanding the environmental benefits available from sensible speed-control measures.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BRAZIL RETAINS FUEL-ALCOHOL PROGRAMMEBrazil continues to pursue its controversial policy of supporting theuse of alcohol as a fuel for road vehicles. An executive committee hasdecided to retain the programme of subsidies for fuel alcohol producedfrom Brazilian sugar cane. The market for alcohol is also guaranteed bythe committee's decision to maintain the 22% minimum alcohol content inpetrol.Further, the committee has entered into talks with sugar cane growersand distillers to look for methods of promoting the creation of a greenfleet in Brazil. The resulting scheme is likely to provide subsidies toencourage buses, taxis and other urban public vehicles to switch tofuel with a higher alcohol content.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NATURAL GAS HEAVY-DUTY ENGINE MEETS ULEV STANDARDSThermo Power Corporation has succeeded in producing a natural gas heavy-duty engine capable of meeting the USA's Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle(ULEV) standards. The ULEV standard is the next most stringent standardafter the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) category, and Thermo Power'sengine is the first natural gas engine to be granted ULEV status. Theengine's success further extends the potential market for NG heavy dutyvehicles into those areas where the most stringent exhaust standardsare in operation.Thermo Power's Tecodrive engine is based on a 4.3 litre General MotorsCorporation petrol engine block. Thermo Power modified the originalengine for optimal operation on natural gas by using an advancednatural gas fuel-injection system and closed-loop electronic controls.The result is an engine that provides performance similar to a petrolversion, while producing much lower emissions the engine easily meetsthe ULEV standard, producing just 6% of the permitted amount of non-methane hydrocarbon emissions, 16% of the carbon monoxide limit and 45%of the nitrogen oxides standard.The engine's development was partly supported by the US Department ofEnergy, and its first commercial use will be in 276 vehicles for UPS.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FUEL CELL VEHICLE HITS THE MARKETThe first vehicle powered by a fuel cell has entered the market placein the US. Fuel cells are mini power-plants that produce power bycombining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water withoutcombustion and, perhaps more importantly, without pollution. Fuel cellshave long been seen as the ultimate clean, alternative power source forvehicles. However, their rapid development in recent years has meantthat they are now being taken seriously.The Genesis ZEV's specification and performance mean that manufacturersof conventional vehicles can, for now, rest easily. The Genesis uses a7.5kW fuel cell, runs for three hours on a full tank of hydrogen, has arange of around 45 miles and a reckless top speed of 15 mph. Fuel tankshold compressed oxygen and hydrogen and these can be refilled in 15minutes. The vehicle is intended for use in operations such as airportcargo hauling, grounds maintenance, or as a people mover in amusementparks.The vehicle and associated fuelling stations were developed in acollaborative effort by Energy Partners Inc., Western Golf Car andTelesis Cogeneration. The Big Three vehicle manufacturers in the US allhave fuel cell development programmes in conjunction with the USDepartment of Energy. A variety of independent programmes is also underway throughout Europe and North America. Most recently, Chicago TransitAuthority started a two year trial operating three buses powered byBallard fuel cell engines. The power density of fuel cells is beingconstantly improved, and their use in vehicles will become morewidespread as more progress is achieved.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NATURAL GAS VEHICLE WINS AWARDA natural gas vehicle design has been recognised by Popular Sciencemagazine as one 1995's 100 greatest achievements in science andtechnology.

Beginning in March 1996, thePetroleum Energy Centre (PEC) of Japan will transfer technologies toits Thai counterpart, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand. The transferwill enable the Thai organisation to carry out its own analysis in thesearch for cleaner fuels and oils.The project will involve Japan supplying both expertise and equipmentso that fuels and lubricant specifications can be defined that are mostsuitable for the prevailing conditions in Thailand.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996MOBIL LAUNCHES CLEANER DIESELMobil has launched a new diesel fuel, Cleanerburn Diesel Plus, which itclaims produces 30% less particulate emissions and 80% less black smokeemissions than ordinary diesel fuel. Hopes of reduced duty for thistype of cleaner burning diesel were not realised in the UK Budget (NEWSANALYSIS, December) and the extra refining processes involved mean thatsuch fuels are more expensive to manufacture than standard fuels. As aresult, without subsidy, their use in the UK is likely to remainlimited.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996GENERAL MOTORS PUNISHED FOR POLLUTING CADILLACSGeneral Motors (GM) faces a bill of around $45m as punishment forfitting inadequate pollution control devices to nearly 500,000Cadillacs. Although GM agreed to the settlement, it continues todispute the allegations made by the US EPA that form its basis.The punishment was agreed with the US Department of Justice, on behalfof the EPA, for installing illegal devices in Cadillacs that defeatpollution controls. The guilty device is an engine control systemdesigned to remedy stalling problems that had occurred when drivers ofthe 4.9 litre, V8 engine Cadillacs turned on their climate controlsystems. The device works by increasing the fuel to air ratio when theair conditioning system is in use.Problems arise because the engine control system overrides the emissioncontrol system, resulting in emissions of carbon monoxide that arethree times the legal limit. GM failed to disclose the use of thedevice or its adverse effect on pollution control. However, the EPAdiscovered the problem in 1993 during routine emissions testing andsubsequently charged GM with violations of the Clean Air Act. The EPAestimates that the use of the device has resulted in the additionalrelease of approximately 100,000 tonnes of carbon monoxide.The agreement makes three demands of GM:* a civil fine of $11 million;* the 470,000 Cadillacs sold since 1991 must be recalled and repaired:the repair involves fitting a new engine control system to each vehicleand the whole exercise will cost around $25 million; and* $8.75m to establish an emission remedial project fund to financeschemes to reduce air pollution. The fund will be used to repair thedamage done by the Cadillacs and is likely to be used for schemes toaccelerate the scrapping of old, polluting cars and buses.The punishment forms a landmark in that it involves the first judicialvehicle recall on environmental grounds, and the fine of $11m ranks asthe second largest meted out under the Clean Air Act.The settlement has left General Motors feeling rather embittered withthe EPA and the Justice Department. GM issued a statement in which itmade clear that the company strongly disagreed with the allegationsmade and considered the issue to be a matter of interpretation ofcurrent regulations . The company stressed that it had agreed with thesettlement as an appropriate resolution of the issue, in line with itsenvironmental commitment.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996PARTICULATE REDUCTION SYSTEMS ON TRIAL IN LONDON BUSESRival systems for reducing emissions of harmful particulates areundergoing trials with two bus firms in London.EZ Traps have been fitted to four buses operated by Leaside buses.

Phase one of the ambitiously titled Plan to SolveAtmospheric Problems was introduced in December 1995 and includes anextension of the ban on each car's use during winter smog episodes fromone day a week to two. It has been estimated that this measure willresult in around 20% less traffic. Phase one also involves cuttingindustrial emissions by up to 40% during smog emergencies. Despitethis, critics have argued that the plan imposes the heaviest burden onmotorists while not doing enough to reduce factory emissions.In 1992, a government study concluded that 76% of air pollution was dueto vehicles. More recently, a study by the University of California-Irvine concluded that the majority of smog came from cooking fuel.Whatever the source of the emissions, the authorities have been forcedinto action by recent episodes of poor air quality. In the week priorto the announcement of the new measures, air pollution was grave enoughto cause breathing problems for around 400,000 of the city's 20 millioninhabitants. With ozone levels reaching twice the acceptable limits,factories were asked to reduce production and outdoor school activitieswere prohibited.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CHINA'S POLLUTION PROBLEMS WORSENChina is experiencing an increasingly serious rise in motor vehicleemissions that has led to Beijing's vehicle pollution problemssurpassing those of Los Angeles and Tokyo.

Changes tothe California Air Resources Board (CARB) mandate are still underconsideration and fresh rumours circulate almost daily. The most likelyalterations to the scheme incorporate the following:* large demonstration fleets of electric vehicles may be required forthe years 1998 to 2000. The numbers under consideration are 750electric vehicles for 1998, with 1,500 in the two subsequent years.After the year 2000, CARB are likely to insist on retaining the ZEVsales targets for 2001 (5% of sales) and 2003 (10%).* the development and use of advanced batteries would be encouraged byawarding EVs using such batteries multiple sales credits. For instance,the sale of an EV using an advanced nickel-metal hydride battery mightmerit three credits while a vehicle with a conventional lead-acidbattery would only rate a single credit. In this way, a vehicleproducer could amass sufficient EV credits to meet any mandate byselling a smaller number of vehicles fitted with advanced batteries.* CARB is likely to insist on maintaining the established goals forcutting pollution. For instance, the equivalent air pollution goals toa 2% ZEV mandate could be met by producing cleaner burning petrol carsor vehicles using alternative fuels such as natural gas.The ongoing review and possible changes to California's 1998 mandatehave left the plans of New York, Massachusetts and Vermont a littleexposed. These states opted into the ZEV mandate scheme under theNortheast Ozone Transport Region's plans. It remains unclear whetherthese states can maintain their plans for ZEV sales in 1998 without themomentum provided by California.Aside from the negotiations and political manoeuvrings, a new study hascast doubt upon manufacturers high price projections for EVs. Pricingfor Success: Using Auto Industry Models to Review Electric VehicleCosting and Pricing was compiled by Green Car Media, an independentresearch organisation. The study claims that the price estimates forelectric vehicles are arbitrarily high and do not reflect typicalpolicy as they involve the absorption of all development costs into thevehicle price. The study concludes that the current high priceestimates have resulted in false and disappointing market projectionsfor electric vehicles.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SOLECTRIA SUNRISE CONTINUES TO IMPRESSThe Solectria Sunrise, the world's first all-composite electric vehicledesigned for mass production, has passed the necessary safety tests andwill begin production in 1998.The Sunrise employs the AC induction drive system currently used inSolectria's production electric vehicles, the Force sedan and E-10pickup truck.

Theenvironmental pressure group decided to take to the drawing board afterbeing frustrated with what they saw as industry's intransigence inreducing the fuel consumption of new cars.The aim of the project was to demonstrate that safety and performanceneed not suffer in the drive to produce a more environmentally friendlycar. The venture began with a production model Renault Twingo and atarget of 50% improvement in fuel efficiency. Three Swiss companies(Wenko AG, Esoro AG and BRM Design) were commissioned to help in thetransformation of the car. The main changes made were:* Engine: the original engine has been replaced with a smaller,supercharged four- stroke petrol engine. This engine produces the sameoutput (50 hp) as the engine in the production model whilst consumingsignificantly less fuel. A diesel engine was ruled out on the groundsof its weight and complexity along with the potential health threatsfrom particulates.* Weight: a group of designers modified the standard car body to reducethe vehicle weight by about 20%, from 810kg to 650kg.* Wind resistance: wind tunnel tests showed that alterations to thevehicle had also succeeded in producing a 30% reduction in windresistance.Other modifications included the introduction of tyres with lowerrolling resistance, and the fitting of a speed governor set at 130 km/h(80 mph).The vehicle was scheduled to undergo road and fuel consumption testsduring December 1995. Prior to the results of those tests, Greenpeacewas anticipating that the car was capable of doing 100 kilometres onbetween 3 and 3.5 litres of petrol, the equivalent of between 80 and 95mpg. The modifications made to the vehicle would add around #1,000 tothe cost of a production Twingo. Of course, if significant fuel savingswere realised during actual use, the extra cost of the vehicle couldsoon be recouped through reduced fuel costs.Greenpeace claims that there is a market for highly fuel-efficientvehicles, citing public opinion polls in Germany showing that two-thirds of all car buyers would opt for such a car if it were offeredfor sale. Despite its apparent design success, Greenpeace is at painsto point out that the project is for demonstration purposes only andthat it has no intention of becoming a car manufacturer.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NEW ROVER 200 SERIES CARS DESIGNED FOR FUEL EFFICIENCYThe new Rover 200 Series models show innovative features in engine andtransmission design which contribute to better fuel efficiency andlower emissions.All of the 12 models available in the range use engines from Rover's K(petrol) and L (diesel) series.K Series engines: Four versions of the Rover K series engine feature inthe new 200 range, ranging from the 1.4 litre, 8-valve 75PS unit to the1.8 litre 16 valve 145PS unit fitted with Rover's patented VariableValve Control system.All of the engines in the K family feature ultra-light sandwichconstruction of low pressure aluminium sand castings, held together byhigh-tensile through-bolts for strength and low distortion. Efficiencyis a key concern and is apparent throughout from the advancedcombustion management to the low coolant volume, which gives a fastwarm-up ensuring minimum emissions and fuel consumption from a coldstart.All 1.4 and 1.6 litre engines in the 200 range have a grouped injectionstrategy, in which alternate pairs of injectors are fired in turn,giving improved efficiency compared with the previous method of bankedinjection where all four injectors fired simultaneously.L Series engines: Two versions of the L series direct injection 2 litreturbo-diesel engine are available in the 200 range. The lower-costversion has conventional mechanically-controlled fuel injection, anddevelops a maximum power output of 86PS.Of more interest is the sophisticated 105PS version. This engineemploys an ultra- efficient combustion system, with near-vertical fuelinjectors firing directly into compact re-entrant shaped combustionchambers formed in the tops of the pistons. Two-stage fuel injectionallows quieter and cleaner operation by initiating combustion moreprogressively.Emissions control features include exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),which adds a calculated amount of exhaust gas to the inlet charge tolimit combustion temperatures and minimise emissions of nitrogenoxides. A two-way oxidising catalyst is also fitted to the exhaustsystem to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons andparticulates.All of the models in the 200 series are capable of meeting the nextstage of European Union emissions legislation which comes into effectin 1997.Transmissions: In addition to the manual and conventional automatictransmissions available, the 216 models are available with the optionof a CVT (continuously variable transmission). CVT provides a livelyresponse to the throttle but is also capable of delivering better fueleconomy than conventional automatic transmissions.CVT effectively provides an infinite number of ratios instead of thefour or five ratio steps typically available. The key working parts aretwo pulleys with conical driving faces which have working diametersthat can be varied by means of hydraulic control of the spacing betweenthe driving faces. In Rover's own tests, the vehicle fitted with CVTshowed better fuel economy than the vehicle with a conventionalautomatic transmission. Indeed, the CVT car even bettered the economyof the vehicle with a manual transmission.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996US 55 MPH SPEED LIMIT ABOLISHEDDespite strong misgivings about the safety implications, PresidentClinton has signed a bill which abolishes the US national speed limitof 55 mph (88 km/h) and allows individual states to set their ownlimits.

Supporters of the limit'sabolition were jubilant and dismissed the safety fears as unjustified.In reality, the effects of speed limits upon accident rates are complexand there are numerous studies available to back up both sides of theargument.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996OECD RECOMMENDS THAT CANADA RAISE TRANSPORT TAXESThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) hasrecommended that Canada should increase the level of taxation ontransport to meet its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.In a review of Canada's environmental performance, the OECD points outthat Canada has committed to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990levels by the year 2000 and thereafter to start reducing emissions.However, current projections show a 13% increase in CO2 emissionsbetween 1990 and 2000. To help close the gap between projection andtarget, the OECD recommends using economic instruments such as taxesand other charges in the transportation sector. The study notes thatthe Canadian tax on petrol represents about 47% of the consumer price,one of the lowest proportions among OECD countries.The review is being considered by the Canadian government andindications so far are that the recommendations may be acted upon. TheCanadian environment minister, Sheila Copps, has made it clear that sheis examining the whole range of fiscal options including raisingexisting taxes, introducing new charges and adopting a system oftradeable permits. Ms Copps concurs with the OECD's view that voluntarymeasures will be insufficient to meet Canada's stabilisation target forCO2.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996THAI GOVERNMENT TO CRACK DOWN ON MOTORCYCLESThe Thai government is understood to be studying new incentives toreduce pollution. The newly elected administration of Prime MinisterBanharn Silpa-archa has made it clear that it intends to introducepolicies based upon the polluter pays principle. Specifically targetedin the vehicle sector will be motorcycles powered by highly pollutingtwo-stroke engines. Around 500,000 such vehicles are sold annually andthey can be expected to be subject to much higher sales tax in 1996.Thailand's new-found environmental concern follows persistent criticismof the government for neglecting the environment in its drive towardsrapid economic development.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EC VEHICLE RECYCLING DIRECTIVE THIS YEARThe European Commission is preparing a new directive aimed atharmonising the recycling of vehicles across member states. Theproduction of a Waste Framework Directive was listed in the Commissions work programme for 1996.It is widely anticipated that the directive will place responsibilityfor end-of-life recovery upon the motor industry. To promote recycling,the directive is also likely to include provisions for scrappingincentives so that owners of old, highly polluting vehicles areencouraged to trade them in for less polluting new cars.The detailed timetable for the proposal of the directive is uncertainas the Commission is already facing a significant backlog of measurescarried forward from the 1995 work programme.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996LOBBYING INCREASES ON US NLEV PROGRAMMEThe US continues to supply the most engrossing of the big battles forthe motor industry. Currently, the EPA's proposal for a national lowemissions vehicle (NLEV) programme is causing friction between thevehicle manufacturers and the oil companies. The programme is intendedto define a low-emissions vehicle for the entire US. Formal commentsare currently being made on the plan and lobbying by representatives ofthe two protagonists has been intense.The oil companies are concerned that they will be required to produce anew fuel specification for the programme and have insisted that anational fuel is technologically unnecessary for the achievement ofClean Air Act goals. Further, in a now familiar refrain, the industryhas asserted that the provision of a national fuel would have adevastating economic impact on the refining industry, jeopardising thevery existence of many firms.For its part, the motor industry has long used the electric vehiclemandates in California, New York, Massachusetts and Vermont asbargaining counters in their negotiations on the NLEV scheme. Even withCalifornia back-tracking on its mandate, the manufacturers continue toassert that they cannot realistically move forward on the NLEVprogramme until all the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates have beendropped.Thus far, the EPA is retaining a cautious stance and has not shownfavour to either industry's viewpoint. However, once firm proposals aremade, the lobbying from all sides is expected to be stepped up anothergear.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996IMPLICATIONS OF TRANSPORT POLICY FOR ENGINEERING INDUSTRYThe Engineering Employers Federation (EEF) has published a report thatconsiders the different aspects of transport policy and theirimportance for the engineering industry. The body of the reportconsists of a study carried out for the EEF by the Henley Centre thatconsiders the transport policies of the UK government along with thoseproposed by opposition parties and special interest groups.Based upon the findings of the Henley Centre study, the EEF calls for acomprehensive and integrated transport strategy which effectively dealswith the issues of competitiveness and environmental protection . TheEEF lays particular emphasis upon the need for investment plans toprovide integrated transport systems and cleaner technologies.Specifically, these plans should include a vision of the transporttechnologies which will be available two or three decades ahead, inorder to realise the full potential of low-pollution vehicletechnologies. The EEF favours this approach rather than what they seeas the current trend of focusing upon restricting transport or travelbecause of the shortcomings of current technologies. The report offerssupport for the use of fiscal incentives to promote environmentalobjectives and backs the SMMT's call for scrapping incentives to beintroduced.The government is urged to resist the temptation to make further cutsin infrastructure spending. The EEF are critical of the wild swings ofrecent government investment in transport equipment and believe thatthe lack of planning in investment policy shows that the governmentlacks a credible industrial policy.Mixed Signals: Implications of Transport Policy for the EngineeringIndustry is available from EEF, Broadway House, Tothill Street, LondonSW1H 9NQ.

The IPCC is made up ofaround 2,500 scientists, climatologists and experts from more than 100nations. The group's tasks comprise assessing the scientific evidenceof climate change, calculating its impact and devising responses.The scientific part of the programme unveiled its latest report in Romelast month. The group concluded that the balance of evidence suggests adiscernible human influence on global climate . The scientists also putforward their best estimate that mean surface temperature will be 2oChigher in the year 2100 than in 1990. This comparatively small increasemasks larger, localised temperature changes and important shifts inclimatic patterns such as storm frequencies.Road traffic is the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide, the maingreenhouse gas, throughout much of the world. If evidence of climatechange continues to gather, attention will become increasingly focusedon the growing numbers of road vehicles and, more importantly, theirescalating use.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996AA: RESPONSE TO THE GREAT TRANSPORT DEBATEThe UK Automobile Association (AA) has published its response to the 20questions on transport and the environment posed by Dr Brian Mawhinneywhen UK Secretary of State for Transport.Some of the main opinions put forward by the AA are detailed below:* CO2 emissions: transport is being unfairly targeted for reduced CO2emissions by the annual increase in road fuel tax of 5% aboveinflation. This policy does not make economic sense and should bereviewed.* Toxic emissions: effective policing of emissions from vehicles isrequired, carried out at a local level. The AA supports the principleof roadside emissions testing, as allowed under the 1995 EnvironmentAct.* Traffic growth: economic growth and traffic growth cannot beuncoupled to a significant extent. Restrictions on car use wouldundoubtedly help improve air quality, but the improvements would bemarginal when compared with the gains already being brought about bytechnological advances.* Road pricing: user charging would have to be widely accepted as alegitimate transport policy tool before it could be implemented. The AAbelieves it to be a longer-term policy option.* Motoring taxation: incentives should be used to encourage the sale ofvehicles with lower emissions. Further, a fundamental review ofmotoring taxation is required, with a view to improving theenvironmental performance of vehicles through fiscal incentives andpenalties.In summary, the AA believes that the key to a successful transport andenvironment strategy is a combination of investment to provide levelsof access at a standard people expect, and traffic restraint/management that people accept as being sensible. The AA considers thatgoing with the grain of people's lives is the only way of securingacceptable and achievable transport policy objectives if the electoratecannot see the sense in the measure, or it is perceived to be unfair,it will be rejected.Transport: the way ahead the AA's response is available from AA PublicPolicy (tel: 0 (44) 1256 491926).Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BODY AND CHASSIS INNOVATIONSConference on Materials for Lean Weight Vehicles: Part OneInnovation, both in materials and in methods of assembling structuralcomponents, was covered in a topical conference on Materials for LeanWeight Vehicles organised by The Institute of Materials and held atWarwick in the UK in late November 1995. It was attended by about 130delegates, mainly from Europe and representing automotivemanufacturers, component makers, material suppliers and researchinstitutes. AEA attended and presents its summing up in two parts thismonth covering the body and chassis papers.Weight saving current positionIncreases in the weight of the car of today stem from the moderncustomer's requirement for increased safety, performance, comfort andpleasure. Items which at one time were optional extras are nowstandard, and this in turn spawns a new spate of optional extras asmanufacturers vie with each other to tempt the customer.Despite the increasing use of lightweight materials the weight of carson average has increased. For example the kerb weight of a Ford Fiestain 1976 was about 700 kg and there was little difference between thebasic model and the high series; the 1994 version has a basic kerbweight of about 800 kg rising to 1000 kg for the high series. However,customers expect and even demand good driving characteristics inacceleration and power, combined with improved fuel consumption and agood image. Stronger engines are necessary to provide effective power.But stronger engines require heavier transmission and suspensioncomponents leading to further increases in vehicle weight.Such changes have led the weight spiral, especially in luxury cars.Acceleration, rolling and hill climbing resistance are directlyproportional to mass and combined probably make up between 70% and 80%of the total road resistance. So, unchecked, a weight spiral leadsdirectly to progressive increases in road resistance and increased fuelconsumption. To break this, vehicle weight must be reduced.The reduction of vehicle weight has focused on engineering effortbecause lightweight component developments present potentialdisadvantages which have to be resolved and which may require noveltechnical or manufacturing solutions. Automotive manufacturers have tocomply with global legislation which is constantly being reviewed andupdated. Emissions regulations necessitate significant improvements inengine and vehicle efficiency, and in the USA the Corporate AverageFuel Economy (CAFE) legislation dictates a minimum average fuel economyacross manufacturer's range. A lower weight vehicle facilitatesimproved efficiency and can be achieved by vehicle downsizing, reducingindividual component weight contributions or an entirely new structuraldesign.Lightweight structures may enable smaller engines to be used withoutimpairing performance. But there are problems. The cost of lighterweight materials or associated process routes may be higher than forestablished practice. This is likely to be so for advanced materials,such as metal matrix composites (MMCs). Thus the rule must be tominimise waste wherever possible by using near net shape techniques. Itshould also be remembered that development of alternative materials andprocesses inevitably incurs an element of additional cost which has tobe recovered through savings.Moreover, confidence has to be gained by quality validation andinspection analysis which must continue for a long period into theinitial production runs. Technical knowledge needs to be constantlyavailable for the volume supply of raw materials at acceptable cost andfor the processing route to achieve the required component forms. A co-ordinated approach to component design philosophy is thereforenecessary since the materials, design form and manufacturing route areintricately interlinked; and successful implementation of a weightreduction programme will depend on sources and details of each of thethree elements. Computerised component design and analysis systems areessential to enable the optimisation of shape to meet performancecriteria which can yield significant weight reductions in the use ofestablished or alternative materials.The automobile body is the largest and also the heaviest individualcomponent, accounting for 20% to 30% of vehicle weight. It thereforepresents the greatest potential for reductions. Targeting body weightalso permits secondary savings. But reducing car weight must go hand inhand with more rigidity, greater safety and better handlingcharacteristics. Hence the joining and forming methods and the chassisshould also come under the microscope.Hypercars the next revolutionThe Keynote Speaker was Mr Amory B Lovins, Director of Research, RockyMountain Institute, Colorado, USA. Mr Lovins and his team havedeveloped a unique analytical approach to the design and manufacture ofthe car, and his opening speech on Hypercars the next revolution fullydemonstrated this. He pointed out the conflict between customerswanting better cars which often meant heavier cars and the pressures onthe car manufacturers to reduce the weight of cars to help in meetingfuel emission regulations through improved fuel consumption. In the US,average fuel consumption is levelling off at about 8 litres/100 km (35mpg), with a target of achieving half that rate by the year 2005through an incremental approach to design and manufacture.Mr Lovins advocates a leapfrog approach by a direct attack on thefactors which are wasting much of the energy in the fuel. He cited dragcoefficient, frontal area, mass and tyre rolling resistance. Reducingthese would bring about spectacular results. To these improvements headded a hybrid electric drive with electricity generated onboarddriving all four wheels and the recovery and storage of some of theelectrical energy for re-use. Finally a light carbon fibre body wouldreduce the mass still further. He postulated that this approach couldachieve a fuel consumption of at least 4 litres/100 km by the year2000. Mr Lovins analysis is fascinating and it is planned to give afuller account of his work in a later edition of Automotive EnvironmentAnalyst.Audi's experience with the A8The first paper was presented by Mr H Behrens (Project ManagerDevelopment, Audi AG) on The aluminium Audi A8 . Audi had collaboratedwith Alcoa for over ten years to develop a new body technology calledthe Audi Space Frame (ASF) which enabled them to produce the Audi A8,the world's first automobile to be designed specifically for aluminiumproduction. The outcome was a vehicle body up to 40% lighter, yet morerigid and thus safer than a comparable steel body. The body in white(BIW) weighs about 247 kg, the same as that of the VW Golf BIW. After acomprehensive analysis aluminium was chosen because:* it is the third most common metal on earth: thus no potential supplyproblems;* it offers good weight reduction its density is about one third thatof steel;* it has good dimensioning possibilities;* it offers reduction in waste of raw material in production;* the strength of deep drawn heat treated aluminium and steel are aboutthe same;* it offers ease of recycling.The main disadvantage of aluminium is that its elastic modulus andtherefore its stiffness is only about one third that of steel. Thisdictated the use of an ASF into which each surface component isintegrated with a load bearing function. Novel features are a framestructure of straight or curved extruded sections with vacuumdiecastings at nodal points where the loads are highest, together withload bearing sheet aluminium surface components. Individual elements inthe frame are metal inert gas welded together and the sheet is joinedmainly by self-piercing punch rivets.Safety is also an important feature. The combination of lightness andrigidity means that an automobile with an ASF body performs better thana heavier vehicle during a handling course. The ASF body easilysatisfies current safety legislation and combines two vital passivesafety features: a rigid cage-like passenger survival space and energyabsorbing members providing tolerable deceleration rates. Howevercrashes which necessitate repairs are inevitable and Audi claims that anormal dealer bodyshop can perform 95% of all accident repair work andonly where the frame has been damaged does an ASF vehicle have to betaken to a specialist bodyshop.To date 20,000 of the A8 model have been built and the currentproduction rate is 60 to 70 cars per day. Looking ahead Audi knows thatit will get more savings in weight by using an aluminium monocoque, butthis will involve bonding sheets together. Work is continuing on thisand there may be something to report within the next three years.Steel's potential for lightweightingThe rivalry between aluminium and steel as the major material for theconstruction of cars, particularly car bodies, became apparent in thepresentation of the next paper, titled The ultra light steel auto body, byMr E F Walker and Mr K Lowe of British Steel Strip Products. Mr Walkersaid that the pattern of steel developments has demonstrated the steelindustry's response to the changing requirements of improved bodydesigns, greater durability and more recently the demands for weightreduction to improve fuel consumption and air quality. Steel producershave traditionally collaborated with their customers on a one-to-onebasis to develop the quality of their materials. This has contributedto weight reduction mainly through agreements on the optimum grade andgauge required after a detailed study of manufacturing and performancedemands of each part of the vehicle body. The development of highstrength steels has also contributed to vehicle weight reduction. Re-phosphorised and bake-hardened steels can be used for body panels withhigh strength low alloy (HSLA) steels and dual- phase steels forunderbody and structural parts.While these developments do produce weight savings, something moresubstantial is required. In the USA a 1993 study to evaluate thepotential for weight reduction reported that it was possible to reducethe weight of a mid-size American car by nearly 64 kg, remove 50 partsand lower variable manufacturing cost by $40. In early 1994, the worlds steel companies, including British Steel, formed a consortium topursue the next steps in vehicle weight reduction using steel. TheUltra Light Steel Auto Body (ULSAB) project was launched in July 1994,funded by 32 steel companies from 15 countries. The aim was to designand build a lightweight efficient body structure which would be viablefor mass production and would meet a high level of functional andstructural performance. Mr Walker went on to describe the work on thisproject to date and this is reported on page 18 in the article SteelThreats and Responses .The challenge from high modulus compositesA look into the future followed, with the presentation of the resultsof research into the use of new materials and designs. The paper TheMOSAIC front structure in HMC a unique approach to lightweighting waspresented by Mr P Valersteinas of Renault and Mr J Penon andMr H E Rowlands of DSM Resins. MOSAIC Material Optimisation for aStructural Automotive Innovative Concept was a European researchproject (under the EUREKA programme) on materials for use in automobileproduction. Masterminded by Renault, it brought together a carmanufacturer and raw material producers. MOSAIC led to two prototypecars based on the Renault Clio, one made in steel and the other in ahybrid structure of aluminium and composite material. Project time wasfour years from 1991, and the budget FFr350 million. Partners in thesecond prototype were Renault, Norsk Hydro for the aluminium spaceframe, Enichem and Montecatini for the floor pan, DSM for the frontstructure, and Ciba- Geigy for the bonding technology. The designstrategy was based on simultaneous engineering principles in that fromthe concept stage designers, material technologists and process andproduction specialists worked together on design development in closeco-operation with Renault.DSM had to develop a new composite for the front end in order to meetthe performance criteria. It was Shimoco HMC (high modulus compound)and consisted of vinyl ester thermosetting resin, mineral fillers,reinforcing glass fibres and additives such as curing agent andpigment. An additional bonus was that up to 10% of recycled HMC can beused in the mix without any change in the properties of the finalproduct. In total, 25 complete front structures were made in thismaterial using full production equipment, and they passed testing forfatigue, stiffness, ageing and crash by Renault. An industrial assemblymodel has indicated that a fully assembled front structure can beproduced from the parts in 50 seconds. DSM concluded that HMC had beenvalidated as a structural material for cars in that it gives:* lower manufacturing costs due to lean production (80 parts on thestandard Clio reduced to 9 with HMC);* substantially lower investment costs;* increased production flexibility from 50 to 2,000 cars per day can beproduced with a linear capital cost increase;* weight reductions of 30% compared to steel (similar to aluminium).DSM concluded that composites remain in the position of challenger totraditional materials such as steel, which continues to be thereference point in the car industry. This paper was interesting in thatit showed that composites can be used for the manufacture of the moreextensive parts of a car, and it highlighted once again that researchcollaboration between a car manufacturer and raw material producersacross Europe can be beneficial to those concerned.The aluminium monocoqueA further contribution on the use of aluminium came from Mr D JMeadows, European Automotive Group, Alcan International Ltd in a paperThe aluminium monocoque BIW the facts, not fiction .There are two options, the conventional stamped sheet monocoque (SSM)which offers up to 50% weight saving compared to a spot welded steelcar, and the extruded space frame (ESF) which would give 30% to 40%saving. Both have their advocates, the latter's advantages being thattooling costs are claimed to be low and model changes can be effectedwithout major structural modification; but to the largest producers ofcars the former offers the greatest weight saving and the least changefrom their current manufacturing practices and thus is more likely tobe chosen. Therefore, in order to maximise the weight savings of a SSM,Alcan has developed a technology known as AVT which encompassesmaterials, surfaces and joining methods that include adhesive bondingand spot welding. AVT is based on the use of a pre-treated and pre-lubricated material and bonding with an advanced heat curing epoxyadhesive developed with Ciba-Geigy.Alcan has worked with a number of motor manufacturers on an SSM BIWwhich was fully motorised and subject to full vehicle structuralevaluation programmes, with creditable overall results. Motor cars havebeen built on the SSM principle for many years and productionprocesses, manufacturing equipment and knowledge have been refined toproduce the lowest cost vehicles. Alcan decided to stick with thisroute, recognising that for a manufacturer to change to buildingaluminium ESFs would entail not only the use of a new material but alsorendering much of the existing manufacturing knowledge and equipmentredundant.The relative merits of SSM and Clad ESF have been stated by Alcan asshown in Table 1 overleaf.Attention was drawn to Ford's increasing commitment to aluminiumfollowing the Aluminium Intensive Vehicle. For model year 1997 the cabof Ford's new truck will be made of adhesive bonded aluminium and willweigh just 113 kg. There will also be over 100,000 bonnets and boots inaluminium on Ford cars.Table 1STAMPED STEEL MONOCOQUEAdvantages                             DisadvantagesEstablished design, manufacturing and  High tooling and investment performance technology                costsComplex 3-D shapes and interfaces      Significant tooling possible                              Details of forming andCost and time of styling revision      joining can result in largerOptimal mass efficiency                sections than for steelWide range of established joining technologies availableRange of surface treatment availableProven medium/high volume productionCLAD EXTRUDED SPACE FRAMEAdvantages                             DisadvantagesAssumed low tooling investment cost    Lower mass efficiencyStyling revision simplified            Nodal joining technologySection complexity can be built in     unproven in medium/highPossible parts consolidation           volume                                       Use of welded nodes has high                                       cost and potential tolerance                                       problems                                       Sophisticated forming                                       technology needed to meet                                       packaging requirementsAlready 5% of a car's weight is of aluminium mostly components and bythe year 2000 Alcan is predicting the production of the first monocoquebody (presumably for a mass produced car). By 2015 it expects about 15%of a car to be of aluminium with increased use for both components andskins.Weldbonded steel performanceA growing interest in adhesives was demonstrated by a paper on Highimpact performance weldbonded steel bodyshells by Mr R E Davis of FordMotor Co Ltd and Mr J H Powell of Ciba Polymers. Currently adhesivesare widely used in many applications on automotive body shells forbonding closure panels, roofs, reinforcements and direct glazing, butin highly demanding applications adhesive bonds make littlecontribution to the overall impact energy absorption of the structure.The design benefits of adhesives are improved joint stiffness andfatigue resistance, design freedom and manufacturing flexibility. Forthese to be obtained in other areas of the body structure adhesivejoints must be able to perform as well as spot welded joints whensubjected to impact, since most areas could be required to withstandimpact loads when the vehicle is in service.New tests were developed which represent better what happens to partsof the vehicle when subjected to impact, and these were used toevaluate tougher stronger epoxy adhesives which had been developed inparallel. The tests involve box beams which are representative of theload carrying members of a steel monocoque bodyshell such as pillars,crossmembers, sidemembers and also front ends. In the latter the boxbeam type members of a bodyshell are constrained by large panels suchas the floor pan or inner wings and the ends are generally fixed toother members when being crushed in a collision.With the new stronger epoxy adhesive the tests proved to besatisfactory. Spotwelded beams were also tested to provide the basisfor comparison. Coated steels (electrogalvanised, hot dip galvanisedand galvannealed) were also box beam tested. Both electrogalvanised andhot dip galvanised steel beams behaved similarly to mild steel beams,but galvannealed beams had worse performance. The potential forcomparison came from a study of the thickness of the steel used in thetests. It was found that weldbonded beams were able to maintain ahigher average collapse force and less impact deformation across arange of gauges compared to spotwelded beams. The results suggest thatsome members could be reduced in weight by around 15%.PSA's TULIP concept vehicleThe final paper of this session given by Mr P M Parrott of AutomotiveTechnology Ltd (representing PSA Peugeot-Citroen Group), was on TheTULIP concept vehicle . Since 1991 the PSA Peugeot-Citroen Group hasbeen developing more appropriate urban cars for example the electricversions of both the Peugeot 106 and Citroen AX. What is now beingproposed is a medium term vision of urban transport giving individualfreedom to the general public. This new concept, called TULIP(Transport Urbain, Libre, Individuel et Public), would put at thedisposal of a great many customers a compact two seater electricvehicle.The TULIP concept draws on development work carried out by PSA inpartnership with SORA Composites Group to produce a composite car bodywith limits to the number of structural vehicle parts, the number ofmaterials used (initially from the range of composite materials) andthe manufacturing time. It was from these that the TULIP vehicleemerged consisting of just five primary elements structurally bondedtogether with an epoxy adhesive. Each of the five parts is comprised ofa rigid polyurethane foam core wrapped in a preformed glass fibre matwhich is then injected with polyester resin. The process is calledresin transfer moulding (RTM). The resultant assembly weighs about 33%less than the equivalent steel structure. There is also an element ofrecycling in the manufacture of the vehicle in that waste glass fibrecan be ground and used as a stiffener in the foam core, therebyallowing a lower density foam to be used.Light weight materials for brakesThe first paper in the chassis session was an Investigation of lightweight materials for brake rotor applications , and presented by Dr DGrieve,Dr D C Barton and Prof. D A Crolla of the Department of Engineering,University of Leeds, Mr J D Buckingham, Rover Cars Ltd, and Mr JChapman, BBA Friction.It is well known that during braking the kinetic energy of the movingvehicle is converted into thermal energy. This thermal energy is storedby the thermal mass of the brake rotor (currently cast iron) anddissipation of this stored energy takes place by convection andradiation from the free surfaces of the brake. Moreover the brake,rotor and stator, must be capable of operating over a wide range oftemperatures ( 40 to 800oC) without the loss of structural integrityand excessive thermal distortion. With two or four discs per vehicle,each weighing between 3 kg and 5 kg, a significant saving can beachieved by replacement of the conventional cast iron disc with alighter alternative.The materials chosen for investigation were a high temperature steel, acopper- nickel alloy and a variety of composites (aluminium-MMC,magnesium-MMC, carbon-carbon and Salon 101) but prior to that afunctional analysis of the braking system was undertaken to determinethe direction and scope of the research. This involved three differenttests (cooling test, alpine descent and fade test) carried out on thetest vehicle (Rover 200) after which these results were compared with asimulation using a finite element model. Once the model had beenvalidated it was used to examine a number of materials under theconditions experienced in the three different tests. The effects ofdisc thickness were also studied.All materials except Al-MMC were found to have serious drawbacks.However an Al-MMC disc brake had shortcomings in that it would requireboth improved cooling and thicker cheeks to keep surface temperaturesbelow the quoted maximum and operating temperatures. It has to beconcluded that a more effective and lighter substitute for cast iron asa brake rotor is still some way off.Forging of MMCsStill on the theme of brakes, there followed a scientific paper onForging of an MMC for an automotive component by Messrs A M de Sanctis,E Evangelista and A Forcellese, Department of Mechanics, University ofAncona, Italy, and Mr A Fuganti, Fiat Centre Research, Orbassano,Italy. The paper described research on a lightweight alternative to thecast iron brake drum.It was estimated that a weight reduction of about 40% could be obtainedby substituting the grey cast iron with aluminium alloy matrixcomposites. Frictional tests established that of the three aluminiumcomposites originally selected, alloy 2618 (aluminium containing 20% Al2O3 ) was found to be the most attractive to replace cast iron.A thermal analysis of the brake drum by the finite element method showsthat the good behaviour of the MMC brake drum was predictable, butexperimental tests on components involving repeated braking will benecessary to verify that the maximum temperature reached on the rubbingsurface is below 400oC (at which severe wear takes place). Also thetemperature close to the wheel hub must be suitable for traditionalwheel bearing application of approximately 120oC continually and 180oCmaximum.Forging trials and experimental analysis showed that a finished brakedrum satisfying the soundness requirement could be produced, but thisinvolved machining the critical part of the forging. This caused asubstantial increase in manufacturing cost due to the low machinabilityof MMCs. It was concluded that a more accurate forging design and aproper definition of the forging conditions are required for low costmanufacturing of defect-free MMC brake drum components. It is worthrecording that this collaborative research work was part funded by theEU as a BRITE-EURAM project and involved, besides the authors, an MMCmanufacturer, two forging companies, two universities and a researchcentre in three EC countries.Lighter weight for dynamic and structural componentsA paper entitled A review of light weight components in dynamic andstructural applications by Mr P R J Addis and Mr D P J Rogers of JaguarCars Engineering Centre discussed, with the aid of case studies,potential means for developing reduced weight components. Traditionalmaterials used in structural applications in vehicle manufacturingwhich fulfil quite adequately the requirements of strength, integrity,durability and ease of manufacture are steels, cast iron and aluminiumcasting alloys. But low mass options have emerged, and are continuingto do so.Aluminium and magnesium are being introduced widely for lower weightcomponents, but both suffer from lower stiffness compared with theirferrous counterparts. This can be overcome by good practice in designand manufacturing. Speculation is now mounting about the use of theaerospace material titanium, now that sources of lower cost titaniumalloy powders and finished parts are becoming available from EasternEurope. Its use could be in reciprocating valve train and other enginecomponents.Engineering polymers and composites, which are lighter than metals, areavailable for use as structural components in a vehicle's semi-structural engine components, and suspension tie rods are alreadyproduced from these materials. In manufacturing, emphasis is focusingon processes which as far as possible will give near net shape, andenable complicated designs to be achieved with full integrity. Variousdevelopments in the casting, forging and forming industries indicatethat this is possible.The main obstacles to the introduction of lower weight components wereidentified as increased cost and the availability of technology inrespect of potential new materials. However changes are taking placeand four case studies were cited which illustrated the use of newmaterials for components and different manufacturing processes:* Traditionally the crossbeam has been manufactured by welding sheetsteel pressings including brackets and mounting points for the engineand the wishbones. Substantial corrosion protection is essential. Nowit is planned to replace the steel assembly with a single controlledfill low pressure diecasting in an aluminium alloy that is fully heattreatable and has high strength, low corrosion and good impactproperties. A reduction in weight of 10 12 kg, or about 65% of theoriginal weight, is achieved together with closer tolerances from thenear net shape and relatively simple assembly. However, costs are onlyless than steel for lower volume applications.* Forged alloy steel or high impact nodular cast iron are used for thesteering knuckle, which forms the link between the wishbones and thesteering rod, since it is subject to suspension and steering load in ahigh temperature environment. For low volume vehicles, indirect squeezecastings in aluminium alloys have been introduced with a weight savingof 3 kg per component. It is expected that such components will befitted to high volume, mid-size vehicles in 1996.* For rear wheel drive vehicles the drivetrain contributes asubstantial proportion of the gross weight of the vehicles. Its maincomponent is the propshaft, transmitting power from the gearbox to thedifferential on the rear axle. Steel tubes have been universally usedfor these driveshafts with forged steel yokes and joints welded intothe ends. A centre bearing, a requisite on some large vehicles, adds tothe weight. Under development is an extruded aluminium alloy tubularshaft, if necessary wound with continuous carbon fibre for extrastiffness and better load bearing capability. Yokes of forged orsqueeze cast aluminium alloy are welded into the tube. The lower masspermits higher whirl speeds and removes the need for a centre bearingand two part system on large vehicles. Weight savings of around 50% arebeing estimated, however difficulties remain. The lightweight componentmaterials are more expensive (though this might be offset by ease ofassembly). The large diameter of the shaft may also present problems insystem packaging.* A connecting rod reciprocates at high velocity whilst being subjectto high compressive and inertia forces. Space limitations havetraditionally restricted material choice to forged alloy steel and, forsome lower stress applications, nodular cast iron. Extensive machiningand balancing operations are the norm. Under development is asinterforged alloy steel connecting rod manufactured from powder. Morethan 20% weight saving has been obtained compared with a forged partfor a similar application arising from the very high accuracy of theprocess and the absence of a balancing requirement.On being questioned, the authors said that none of the examplesdescribed were in use in Jaguar cars.Aluminium production technologiesIn a detailed talk on Aluminium control arms in different productiontechnologies , Mr Karl-Heinz von Zengen of VAW Aluminium AG, Bonn,Germany, showed that for the manufacture of any component there is nogeneral best solution, but for every demand there is a specific bestsolution. He pointed out that traditionally a designer tried to solve aproblem by using well known solutions either from within the company orfrom a competitor. By adopting this approach it was rare for mistakesto occur but there was also a distinct lack of innovation.Also, slavishly sticking to best mechanical or other properties to theexclusion of all else ignored important realities of production andcost.Over the years much has changed. Through the introduction ofsimultaneous engineering teams and quality function deployment, a moreprecise definition of the development's goal is given and moredevelopment work is put out to potential producers. The result is afaster innovation cycle and the prospects of lower development costs.The production routes which Mr Zengen covered were forging, extruding,casting, rolling/drawing and welding and the example component was acontrol arm.Forging is the classical production technology for highly stressedcomponents especially in chassis applications. To make the componentcheap in production it is best to have a constant cross-section overthe whole length. Thicker local areas, for example for the housings ofball pins or bearings, requires an additional and possibly expensivedosing process of raw material. It is possible to produce ribs but at ahigher cost. Tooling costs are proportional to the number of partsproduced.Extruding is the process to use for components with complicated butconstant cross-sections over large lengths. Typical applications areroof and seat rails, and from Audi all window frames for movablewindows. In larger sections there are front and rear cross beams ofcars and side panels of heavy trucks. With extruding only, limitedthree-dimensional shape is possible, integration of housing isimpossible and tooling is independent of the number of parts.Casting dominates the use of aluminium in automotive applications witha share of roughly 85%. Applications in the chassis area are typicallycrossbeams for multi link axles, hollow wishbones and similarcomponents in low scale production cars. It is now possible to producealuminium castings with good ductility by a vacuum assisted highpressure die casting technique. Control arms of multi link axles havebeen manufactured by this method and are being used in the new Porsche911 series.Control arms can also be produced by rolling and deep drawing aluminiumsheet but there are drawbacks in that relatively high tooling costsnecessitate large daily and total production numbers, and the thin wallthickness requires broad flanges and a large drawing depth which canlead to package problems. VAW are currently developing a process tomanufacture control rods from a seam welded aluminium alloy tube withends flattened to form the flange and drilled for the bushes. In thisprocess limited three dimensionality is possible by bending. There is ahigh stiffness to weight ratio and tool costs depend upon the number ofparts.In conclusion there was a stark reminder that even if the geometricconditions for the five different technologies are identical, thebehaviour of the part in these different technologies is different.Magnesium diecastingsContinuing the light metal theme was a paper on Magnesium diecastingsin automotive body/chassis applications by Mr P D Caton of DiemakersLtd, Slough, UK, and Mr K Barnes of Diemakers Inc, Monroe City, USA.Mr Caton said that while magnesium diecastings have a higher strengthto weight ratio than aluminium diecastings or car body steel mostEuropean vehicles currently contain very little or no magnesium.Against this, American vehicles now contain an average of around 3 kgper vehicle and this figure is rising significantly. It was the needfor weight reductions to meet the CAFE regulations which stimulatedNorth American engineers to look wider for their choice of materials.The use of magnesium in diecasting in the USA has risen from 4,000tonnes in 1982 to 16,000 tonnes in 1990, and dramatically to anestimated 40,000 tonnes in 1995. By contrast European usage reached apeak of 20,000 tonnes in 1984, declined by about half by 1988, but isexpected to reach 11,000 tonnes in 1995 on a clear upward trend.In 1982 magnesium diecastings were used by Ford for the brake andclutch pedal support brackets on its pickup trucks with a saving of 1.7kg on a component which weighed 2.3 kg in steel. Now it is extensivelyused in this capacity by both Ford and Chrysler. By the 1990s Ford wereusing diecastings for more demanding applications in the form of themain actuator housing and key-lock housing in the steering columnassembly.The principal reason for considering the use of magnesium is usuallyweight reduction. However, less well known properties of magnesium, forexample low heat content and low reactivity to steel, result in higherproductivity and longer die lives when compared with aluminiumdiecastings. Moreover the good fluidity of molten magnesium permits thecasting of complex components containing fine details. The low heatcontent reduces the amount of thermal distortion, enabling closetolerances to be met with the possibility of avoiding a secondarymachining operation. Another attractive property is magnesium's highdamping capacity which makes diecastings suitable for engine componentssuch as valve covers (as specified by Ford, BMW, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz) and for the steering wheel core. Other applications which are nowreceiving attention in the USA and Europe are the integrated dash panelor car cross-beam, and the prototype development of using diecastingfor door frames and boot lids as means of saving considerable weight. Adiecast magnesium dash panel was used by Audi to introduce airbags forthe V8 model, and General Motors has plans for widespread use of thisdesign principle. Besides weight saving from using a one piecemagnesium diecasting, there are additional benefits from a reduction insub-component diversity and assembly costs, and the exploitation ofmagnesium's high damping capacity to absorb noise and vibrationsemanating from the steering column.But not everything is going well for magnesium and its diecasters. Theprice of magnesium in 1995 is up 15% on that in 1994, and there is aproblem obtaining supplies. Mr Caton claimed that this was a result ofpoor forecasting of demand about three years ago which prompted theclosure of two production plants. However, two big plants, in Australiaand Israel, are coming on stream in about a year and the prediction isthat the price of magnesium should return to its 1994 level.Plastic pedalsA paper on an even lighter material, plastic, ended the session.Presented by Mr I S Rendell, Deputy Managing Director of BirkbyPlastics Ltd, it was titled Light weight plastic pedals . He said thattraditionally pedals have been produced by stamping quite heavy gaugedmetal sheet or using steel or aluminium rods. After which extensivewelding, machining, assembly and protective coating were required, allof which added to the cost. Now the space limitation in the footwellarea has further complicated the design of the pedals and pedal boxassembly, inhibiting the use of metals. This, plus the requirements forweight and cost reductions, led to the use of injection moulded plasticparts. These can be of complex designs with integrated functions andare produced in a single operation. Plastics have achieved a 30% to 60%reduction in weight at reduced cost.Worldwide, about 80 million accelerator and brake pedals and about 60million clutch pedals are produced each year. Europe has been changingto plastic pedals in the past 10 years; similar movement in the USAoccurred much later. Birkby started to supply Ford with plasticaccelerator pedals for its Fiesta in 1988; the pedal weighed 120grammes compared with the steel version's 256 grammes; the pedal on the1995 Fiesta weighs only 100 grammes. Most European car manufacturersnow fit plastic accelerator pedals into their vehicles. However theterm plastic does not do justice to the material or its function; it isactually a plastic composite consisting of nylon and a filler of 40%short glass fibres.Car manufacturers such as VW, BMW, Fiat and Ford are also introducingplastic clutch pedals on their latest models. The performancerequirement of a clutch pedal is far more severe than that of anaccelerator pedal. Clutch pedals normally operate at a force of 100 to150 Newtons, two to three times that of accelerators at 40 to 60Newtons. The weight saving is dramatic; metal clutch pedals weigh 480to 630 grammes and plastic ones 220 to 250 grammes. Next it will be theturn of the brake pedal it is thought that Fiat could be the firstmanufacturer to launch it.In fact it is logical to make the whole pedal box assembly in plasticas Fiat is already doing with the Fiat Ducato system. There are over 50parts in the average metal pedal box assembly whereas the Fiat systemhas less than half that number. In metal it weighs nearly 6 kg and inplastic only 2.7 kg. There is also a reputed 20% cost saving.The second part of this conference report, covering the joining andforming and under bonnet topics, will appear in the February 1996 issueof AEA.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996STEEL THREATS AND RESPONSESThe ULSAB projectNews that 32 of the world's steel companies from 15 countries hadformed a consortium to fund the Ultra Light Steel Auto Body (ULSAB)project was remarkable (see CONFERENCE REPORT 1, page 12), and Phase 1has already been completed. Steel is a highly competitive business withsome companies state owned or state subsidised, so such collaborationis rare.It is interesting to speculate on what prompted this move. Two reasonsare high on the list: cars have to be made lighter to help to improvefuel consumption and meet emission regulations, but there is also anincreasingly serious threat from aluminium as a material for carbodies. The production of the Audi A8 and Ford's fleet of 40 AluminiumIntensive Vehicles for testing around the world are prime examples ofthe potential threat to steel's market domination. The stakes are high.This year alone an estimated 38 million cars will be produced worldwideand, after allowing for the aluminium share, about 10 million tonnes ofsteel sheet will have been consumed in the manufacture of bodies-in-white (BIW). On top of this there is the amount that goes intocommercial vehicles. It is in the interests of all auto sheet producersthat such a huge market be defended. Collaboration on a project toproduce lightweight car bodies therefore makes good sense. It is alsogood for the environment.The ULSAB project was launched in July 1994 with the aim of designingand building a lightweight efficient body structure which is viable formass production and will meet a high level of functional and structuralperformance. The consortium commissioned Porsche Engineering Servicesin Troy, Michigan, USA, to carry out the project in three phases:1. Concept phase: this entailed the concept design, engineering andanalysis by Porsche Engineering of a five-seater, medium to largesaloon car.2. Feasibility phase: this involves detail design, engineering andanalysis, building body demonstration hardware and basic BIW testing.3. Exploitation phase: this will be the exploitation of the newlyproven opportunities for cost effective weight reduction in vehicledesign and building programmes.In the analysis of Phase 1, a reference vehicle package was definedfrom a study of nine North American, European and Japanese cars whichcovered mass, static bending, static torsion, and first BIW vibrationmode. Following this, future reference values were calculated for eachperformance parameter, since the ULSAB design will have to compete withfuture vehicles. Also included in the study were nine different steelsall currently available to the automotive industry worldwide, nineproduct parameters and twelve manufacturing processes all in currentuse or capable of immediate implementation. Starting with a projectedvehicle package Porsche Engineering had a free hand in the design ofthe ULSAB.Design conceptPhase 1 has produced a design concept that demonstrates the interactionbetween materials and processes. This design concept makes use ofvarious sheet steels, including high strength, bake hardening and dualphase types (two thirds of the steels are high strength). Each steel ismatched to appropriate forming processes: deep drawing, roll forming,hydroforming (5 parts are hydroformed) and tailored blanking (20 out of78 major parts are tailor blanked). The appropriate joining techniquessuch as spot welding, arc welding, laser welding, weld bonding andmechanical joining are then applied.Mass productionConsiderable attention has been paid to ensuring the viability of theULSAB design for mass production. The sequence of assembly operationsfor the front structure, underbody, body sides and final assembly havebeen detailed. In the framing stages the exterior panels were excludedin order to provide clearance to welds without access holes becausehaving large holes for weld gun clearance next to certain joints provedunacceptable. A mainly conventional overall assembly concept emergedwith an inside-out build sequence being used on a conventionalplatform. No major problems are anticipated in producing different bodystyles.Crash analysisFor Phase 1 crash simulation the computer-modelled BIW was fitted witha bumper system, suspension, fuel tank, doors and a powertrain. Thecrash analysis generally adopted a conservative approach. The front andrear end simulations were performed at 35 mph (56 km/h), exceeding the30 mph (48 km/h) standard. The 50 km/h side impact analysis was basedon a European side moving barrier test, but with a rigid barrier inplace of the standard deformable one. Porsche Engineering alsoconfirmed the protection of occupants in roll over crashes.Performance summaryBased on available vehicle data (benchmark references), the averagebody weight of a typical mid-sized saloon was fixed at 271 kg. Thistypically represents 20% to 25% of the total vehicle weight. The ULSABweighs 205 kg with the same wheelbase, higher torsion and higherbending rigidity. Body weight can therefore be reduced by up to 35%.But there is more. The prospect of beginning with a lighter BIW offersample opportunity for additional weight reduction in powertrain,suspension system, wheels and other components. Calculations put thesesavings at about 50 kg. Lower fuel consumption, lower emissions andreduced environmental impacts result from this lighter, more efficientpackage.Using a technical cost modelling (TCM) methodology IBIS Associates, anindependent automotive cost research company in the US, carried out acosting of alternative designs. It showed that the current conventionaldesign reference BIW would contain 195 pieces and cost $1,116, and thatthe ULSAB BIW would contain 169 pieces and cost $962, a saving of about14%. This saving arises from a combination of more innovative design,fewer parts and more efficient manufacture.BenefitsThe advantages from weight saving in steel include the following:* steel-based weight saving designs and manufacturing technologies canbe implemented quickly because the basic manufacturing structurealready exists;* this in turn means less risk and lower investment, material andmanufacturing costs for car makers; by contrast the use of alternativematerials such as aluminium requires greater investment in terms oftime and money;* environmentally the benefits of vehicle weight savings accruequickly;* it is claimed by the steel industry that steel exhibits overallenvironmental life cycle advantages: cited are its superior anddemonstrable recyclability and a lower impact in the production processthrough lower energy consumption, re- usable solid wastes and a smallervolume of greenhouse gas emissions.The futureIn Phase 2 of the USLAB study, the steel industry consortium isinvesting $20m over the next 24 months to construct demonstrationbodies to verify the design for weight, the ability to manufacture,rigidity and other performance criteria. The evidence confirms that theworld steel industry is taking a serious approach to the threat fromaluminium, and seems intent on nipping this in the bud.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENTThe conference Effective Local Air Quality Management was held on 29November 1995 in London and was sponsored by Local Transport Today. The90 delegates were mostly from local authorities but includedrepresentatives from transport operators, vehicle manufacturers and theoil industry.The conference was convened to assist with the development of aneffective transport policy response to the new responsibilities oflocal authorities detailed in the 1995 Environment Act. Quite simply,this Act involves the government handing down to local councils newduties for ensuring that vehicle emissions do not reach levels whichpose a threat to public health.This conference report focuses on the papers of greatest interest toAEA readers and is not intended to be a complete record of theproceedings.Air pollution and health not a crisis, but action is neededDr Malcolm Green (President, British Lung Foundation) emphasised thatthe health effects of the different pollutants that make up airpollution are often complex and difficult to disentangle. For instance,severe episodes of nitrogen dioxide pollution seem to be associatedwith small increases in mortality, but clinical studies on the effectsof nitrogen dioxide have so far been equivocal. Similarly, despite themuch publicised connection between asthma and air pollution, there isonly anecdotal evidence to support the link.In contrast, though, numerous studies have found that high levels ofozone exacerbate respiratory problems. Perhaps of greater significancefor vehicle manufacturers, recent studies of the effects ofparticulates seem to have effectively confirmed that diesel engines areno more environmentally friendly than petrol engines.Despite the lack of clear-cut evidence, there is now widespreadacceptance that air pollution is an important health issue. There areno easy solutions to the problems but it now seems apparent thatcontinuing unrestricted expansion in our use of private cars is notsustainable. There is a clear need for a rational transport policy.In conclusion, Dr Green emphasised that while air pollution is a causefor concern and requires action, it is not causing a health crisis atpresent.UK government strategy for improving air qualityJames Clappison (Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for theEnvironment) outlined the government's policies for improving airquality.In March 1994, the government published a consultative document,Improving Air Quality, which set out wide-ranging proposals on how thechallenge should be met. Subsequently, the government's policies forair quality management were defined in Air Quality: Meeting theChallenge. The policies detailed in this document were incorporatedinto the Environment Act 1995 and will be used to meet the standardsand targets as due to be defined by the government in December 1995.Guidance for local authorities on assessing and managing air qualitywill also be issued.The policies of the government can be divided into three main areas:National air quality standards and targets: new standards and targetswill be established for nine individual pollutants (benzene, ozone, 1,3-butadiene, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, particulates, nitrogenoxides, lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Some of these havealready been defined and published during 1995.The standards adopted reflect the advice of the government's ExpertPanel on Air Quality Standards and are broadly in line with the latestwork of the European Union and the World Health Organisation. It is thegovernment's objective that these air quality targets should berealised throughout the UK by the year 2005. Local authorities arebeing given new powers and duties to establish plans for delivering thetargets.Air quality management areas: a new framework for local air qualitymanagement will be introduced that places powers and obligations onlocal authorities to deal with areas that do not meet air qualitystandards (air quality management areas).Effective control of vehicle emissions: better air quality dependsabove all on improvements to the transport sector. The five main themesof the approach to this problem are:* new standards for technology, emissions and fuels;* planning policies and local transport strategies aimed at reducingthe need to travel and encouraging use of less polluting modes oftransport;* new environmental responsibilities in partnership with public serviceand other fleet operators;* tighter enforcement of emissions regulations, targeting thosevehicles doing most damage to the environment;* voluntary action and guidance.Role of local authoritiesDr Tom Crossett (Secretary General, National Society for Clean Air andEnvironmental Protection) considered the role of local authorities inensuring effective air quality management in light of the EnvironmentAct 1995.So far, of the nine pollutants for which standards will be set, detailshave been published for benzene, ozone, NOx, SOx and particulates. Ofthese, meeting air quality standards for particulates will present thegreatest challenge for local authorities.The new approach will place responsibilities on local authorities :* to review air quality and assess against standards and objectives;* where standards are not being met, the local authority must designatean air quality management area (AQMA): they must then produce an actionplan proposing how they will tackle the problems in the AQMA;* the measures at their disposal will include emissions testingprogrammes, restricting vehicle access and other traffic managementschemes.While welcoming the government's initiative, Dr Crossett expressed hisopinion that it was impossible to assess the practicality of the newapproach until the strategy is published, regulations and guidancebegin to emerge and the EU's Ambient Air Quality Assessment andManagement Directive becomes embodied into UK law.If the policies so far outlined are to be successful in the UK, thefollowing areas will be important:* adequate resources;* the robustness of standards and their application;* identification of least cost solutions; and* management of cross boundary and inter-agency issues in pursuit ofcost effectiveness.Policy options availableGordon Henderson and Dr Neil Jenkins (Arup Transportation) examined indetail the possible policy options for improving air quality.The importance of vehicle speed/flow in determining emission rates iswell understood. In general, traffic conditions around the optimalspeed of 40 70 km/h (25 45 mph) produce the lowest emissions. At speedsgreater than 70 km/h, emissions tend to increase, particularly fornitrogen oxides. However, the greatest impact occurs below 20 km/h (12mph), where the highest emissions are normally associated with slowmoving traffic, stop/start conditions and queuing. Reducing emissionsfrom traffic can therefore be achieved by:* reducing traffic congestion and promoting free flowing traffic;* encouraging shorter trip distances; and* reducing the number of trips.Although these factors influence emissions, poor air quality actuallyoccurs in specific locations under certain meteorological conditions,when local emissions accumulate and persist.Short-term options to reduce emissionsFines for highly polluting vehicles: the Environment Act 1995 allowsschemes to be introduced that levy fines on owners of pollutingvehicles. As an example of the success of such schemes, Singaporeensures a high level of compliance with exhaust emissions by usingmobile police officers and smoke test teams to patrol the roads daily,fining or prosecuting where necessary.Temporary road closures and traffic bans: powers to restrict vehicleaccess or impose temporary road closures are also included in theEnvironment Act 1995. Clearly, care must be taken to ensure thattemporary bans do not simply transfer the problems elsewhere on theroad network.Traffic management schemes: urban traffic control (UTC) schemes can beused to smooth the traffic flow, thereby reducing fuel consumption andemissions.A recent report cited a study undertaken in Copenhagen in which theeffect of introducing green waves to allow smooth driving at around 40km/h (25 mph) was modelled. It was estimated that such a scheme wouldreduce emissions of CO and HCs by between 25% and 35% during the peakhour and 20% over the duration of an entire weekday. Peak hour NOxemissions would be reduced by between 10% and 25%. Although theseemissions benefits are significant, the study highlighted that thisfreeing up of congestion could ultimately attract more traffic, therebyrecreating the problem.Pilot red routes in London (that allow no parking or waiting) have beenshown to reduce the average journey time by around 15%. However, thepotential of such measures to attract more traffic was alsodemonstrated by the accompanying increase of around 8% in the vehicleflow. Despite this, a net emissions reduction was still achieved on theroutes, of between 1% and 17% for the different pollutants.Although evidence is limited, research on traffic calming seems to showthat the implementation of 30 km/h speed limits and zones incorporatingphysical traffic calming measures usually reduces emissions of nitrogenoxides. The effects of traffic calming on fuel consumption andemissions of CO, HC and CO2 remain less certain and some researchsuggests that emissions of these pollutants are increased. Theseresults are not entirely surprising as traffic calming reduces trafficspeeds by interrupting the flow of traffic: this induces a greaterdegree of acceleration and deceleration, a type of driving associatedwith higher emissions. To achieve a general reduction in emissions,therefore, traffic calming schemes should aim to reduce speeds whilstalso encouraging smooth driving behaviour.Medium/long-term options to reduce emissionsIncreasing attractiveness of alternative modes public transport:improvements to public transport, either by the introduction of newsystems or improvements to existing systems, can induce modal transferand reduce the level of traffic in urban areas. The growth of lightrail schemes is testament to the efforts being made in this area.However, the evidence so far shows that most of the people usingsystems such as the Manchester Metrolink have simply transferred fromexisting bus and rail services. Clearly, the effect on air quality willremain very limited if public transport fails to attract car driversout of their vehicles. Further analysis of the Manchester system showedthe importance of parking commuters who had to pay for their parkingspace were twice as likely to switch to Metrolink as those who had afree space.Guided busways are seen as perhaps a more cost effective alternative tolight rail in certain circumstances. Bus priority measures in generalcan reduce congestion and produce substantial changes in bus emissions(Figure 1).The benefits of park and ride schemes are as yet unproven. A study ofNottingham, Maidstone, Norwich and Shrewsbury indicated that park andride could prompt additional car trips as well as encouraging driversto travel further distances. Oxford has the largest park and ridesystem in the UK and, despite its success, the city has experienced agradual decline in environmental conditions. A new #18m strategy in thecity, which includes further measures to encourage transfer from carsto public transport and restrictions on car parking in the centralarea, is being implemented.Increasing attractiveness of alternative modes walking and cycling:policies which encourage walking and cycling tend to be given a highpriority by most local authorities seeking to develop sustainabletransport policies.York provides a good example of the potential of pedestrianisation asan extensive scheme was introduced in 1987, covering more than 30streets. Outside the city centre, complementary traffic calming schemeshave done much to improve conditions for pedestrians by slowing downand reducing through traffic.High quality cycle routes are also important if cycling is to beencouraged and the #42.5m award to Sustrans to build a national networkof cycle routes is a welcome development. The use of bicycles toreplace short distance trips by cars is especially important because ofthe high levels of emissions associated with such trips and the effectsof cold starts.Car restraint policies parking: parking controls can be applied bylimiting the number of spaces available, the duration permitted, thetype of vehicle allowed and the price charged. The politicalsensitivity of parking measures is great and there exist concerns overthe effects of restrictions on the livelihood of city centres. Also,the impacts of any parking measures are often diluted by thepredominance of private non-residential parking spaces which areunaffected by policy initiatives.Theoretical studies indicate that parking charges can be one of themost effective means of discouraging car use a Transport ResearchLaboratory study concluded that doubling parking charges would reducethe car's share of commuting in the central areas of towns by about13%. Interestingly, it was noted that this doubling of car parkingcharges would have a greater effect in reducing vehicle emissions thana halving of public transport fares.Car restraint policies area bans: heavily polluted cities in mainlandEurope often employ area bans in an attempt to reduce the winter airquality problems. The evidence from cities such as Athens, Madrid andMilan suggests that area bans can have a dramatic effect on trafficlevels and vehicle emissions within the banned area. Areas on theperiphery of the ban, however, may experience a deterioration in theirenvironment and unless the ban is very extensive, overall citywideemissions reductions are likely to be small.Car restraint policies central area licensing/road pricing: fiscalmeasures such as central area licensing/road pricing are designed toalter the relative costs of alternative transport modes. It followsfrom this that if they are to fulfil their objectives, they must besupported by a comprehensive package of measures including investmentin new and improved public transport systems.Perhaps the most interesting projections of the impacts of road pricinghave been developed within the London Congestion Research Programme.This study indicated that imposing a high charge level (#8 all day forthe central cordon; #4 for Inner London) would produce significantchanges in emissions (Figure 2). Further reductions beyond those shownin Figure 2 would result if the charging measures were accompanied byinvestment in public transport infrastructure and service improvements.The widely publicised system of area licensing employed in Singapore isestimated to reduce daily air pollution by around 10% with greaterreductions in the morning-peak emissions of around 30%. Potentialproblems of area licensing are illustrated by the increased congestionand pollution on the ring road, outside the central area. The fullbenefits of area licensing schemes can only be realised if improvementsto alternative modes of travel are introduced in parallel. It followsthat allocation of road pricing revenue to fund complementary publictransport improvements is very important.Planning policies: Planning Policy Guidance Note 13 (PPG 13), publishedin March 1994, introduced a major change in UK policy with increasedemphasis on the inter- relationship of land use planning andtransportation as a means of:* reducing the growth in length and number of motorised journeys;* encouraging alternative means of travel which have less environmentalimpact; and hence* reducing reliance on the private car.In essence, PPG 13 is intended to encourage car-borne shoppers back tothe city centre by moving employment and retail centres back into urbanand suburban areas. However, as shown by the recent RAC report (lastmonth's AEA), there is considerable debate over whether such policiescan reduce overall vehicle mileage and address the wider emissionsissues.The speakers recommended that more practical research be carried outinto options to reduce vehicle emissions to complement the existingtheoretical work. They laid emphasis upon improvements in vehicletechnology as playing a major, if not dominant role, in reducingtraffic-related pollutants in the foreseeablefuture. The principal components in the technological approach will becatalytic converters, particulate traps, improved engine efficiency andthe introduction of cleaner fuels.Sustainable planning policies must be reinforced by a firm commitmentto facilitate and fund high quality, attractive alternatives to the carand an acceptance of the need to implement restraint measuresdeliberately to discourage car use.Air pollution informationJoy Thompson (Planning and Environment Department, Westminster CityCouncil) covered the role of local government in providing informationto the public about air pollution.The Westminster campaign has targeted two groups: air pollutionsufferers, and polluters. Sufferers need to be informed when airquality is going to be poor, and drivers need to know about thecondition of their vehicle and how much it is adding to pollutionlevels.Sufferers air quality information strategy: for most people, theinformation of greatest use is when air quality is predicted to be pooralong with what action they can take to protect themselves. Rather thanpublicise this information in libraries and other public places,Westminster developed a more focused approach to communicating withpeople who suffered during air pollution episodes. A network of keycontact points was established, consisting of schools, pharmacists,general practitioners and hospital accident and emergency units. Acomputerised system is now used whereby pollution warnings areautomatically faxed to the participants in the network when poor airquality is ongoing or predicted. A telephone help line is also used sothat sufferers have direct access to pollution warnings.Polluters Westminster's Exhaust Watch: there are two activitiesinvolved in Exhaust Watch:* the spotter campaign this encourages members of the public to reportvehicles with smoky exhausts. The information is then passed on to theappropriate authority London Buses, the Public Carriage Office or theVehicle Inspectorate;* roadside testing police stop the vehicle and a test is run on exhaustemissions. The driver is given a printout of the results, advice onwhat to do to solve any problems, and an information pack.The problems of how information is communicated are being addressed byan EU project, Efficiency of Information Campaigns in EuropeanMunicipalities which is looking at how air quality information is givenin different European cities, including Paris, Athens, Barcelona andWestminster.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996PUZZLING BUDGETThe recent fuel duty changes made in the UK budget leave some glaringinconsistencies with regard to the treatment of diesel fuels.The good news was that environmental considerations were used tojustify the reduction of duty on natural gas and liquefied petroleumgas and the raising of duty on super unleaded fuel. Further, as part ofthe programme to stabilise CO2 emissions, duties on transport fuelscontinue to be increased by 5% above the rate of inflation.Against this backdrop of environmentally-based fuel duties, thetreatment of diesel fuel appears rather incongruous. It is true thatthe environmental problems of particulates from diesel fuel per se havenot been conclusively proven yet. With the jury still out it is perhapsunderstandable that the Chancellor did not bend to pressure to increasethe duty on diesel fuel above that on petrol.However, what is less comprehensible is why no differential wasintroduced between conventional diesel fuel and low sulphur city dieselemissions are reduced by 40%. Sainsbury's currently subsidises itssales of city diesel so that it costs only 2p per litre more thanstandard diesel. However, the growth of clean diesel should not rest ona supermarket's public relations policy and if clean fuels really areto be encouraged, duties must be reduced. If it is good enough forpetrol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas then why not diesel?Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE ENVIRONMENT ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SOAP STORYThe story of GM's polluting Cadillacs (NEWS ANALYSIS) reads like anepisode of a soap opera, complete with neatly highlighted moralmessage.To begin with, let us examine the polluting nature of these vehicles.Routine testing found that the engines emitted up to three times thepermitted level of carbon monoxide with climate control on. In simple,moral terms this can be seen as: in trying so hard to meet thetemperature and comfort requirements of those inside the vehicle, GMfailed to care adequately for those on the outside.So, with the transgression discovered and the villain of the piececast, it was time for a tidy demonstration of the polluter paysprinciple. These are troubled times for the EPA and one can almost hearthem rubbing their hands with glee at this straightforwardenvironmental wrongdoing. Not only must GM pay a fine, recall and refitthe sub-standard vehicles sold, but they must do good and spend another$9m repairing the damage.As the sun sets on the story, General Motors is continuing to growl andsplutter that they have been unfairly cast as environmental criminals.Certainly, the tale seems too simple and in the final stages, the EPAdid appear to abandon negotiation and use the case as a public platformon which to flex their muscles. This decision may yet backfire if thenet result is that the relationship between car manufacturers and theEPA has been further tarnished.Back to Headline List WT03-B28-40IA059-000320-B037-353http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/au10.html 205.156.212.5 19970114203058 text/html 23327HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:29:12 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:34 GMTContent-length: 23140Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/au10.html Sample Issue Copyright AUTOMOTIVE LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNet January 2, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES ND CA JUDGE APPROVES SETTLEMENT OF CHRYSLER MINIVAN CLASS ACTION (799 words) 11TH CIR.

Legge of the Northern Districtof California approved on Nov. 30 the proposed settlement of classactions involving allegedly defective rear-door latches on ChryslerCorp. minivans.  The judge held that the settlement was fair,reasonable and adequate under the law.  Objectors, including sevenindividual plaintiffs and the Center for Auto Safety, had calledthe agreement a "sham" and will appeal the decision.  Hanlon et al.v. Chrysler Corp., No. C-95-2010-CAL (ND CA); see Automotive LR,Dec. 5, 1995.     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)investigated the alleged propensity of the latches to spring openduring accidents.  While maintaining that no defect existed,Chrysler agreed in April 1995 to replace the latches on the4.5 million 1984-1995 minivans in use.     In June 1995, Chrysler and the plaintiffs in six state classactions and the California federal case agreed to a settlementunder which Chrysler would make the replacements and spend$14 million on incentives and an owner-awareness campaign to boostthe response rate if less than 60% of the minivans are repairedwithin 18 months.  Plaintiff attorneys will receive $5 million infees.     Additionally, Chrysler will be released from "any and allclaims for consumer damages or equitable relief, arising out of orrelated to minivan rear liftgate latches."  Owners would only bepermitted to take legal action for personal injury or wrongfuldeath.     In approving the agreement, Judge Legge noted the mainargument made by the Center for Auto Safety -- that the class isn'tgetting anything more than what Chrysler already agreed to when itpromised to replace the latches.  "I don't think that's reallyfully accurate," the judge held.  "Chrysler had no contractual dealwith NHTSA...now Chrysler has a contractual obligation.  It's goingto have an enforceable judgment against it (and) is going to beengaged in an outreach program, as I call it. And the speed...isparticularly important here.  I think that in whatever role I mayhave in this settlement later, the thing I'm going to keep an eyeon mostly is the speed with which this process gets put forth.     "I think it's also true that these class actions -- and by'these class actions' I mean the state actions that ultimatelyresulted in the coming together under the tent of this case of afederal class action -- a least in part, and I think in substantialpart, forced Chrysler into the action it took, and forced Chryslerinto its dealings with NHTSA."     Judge Legge said, "Even though I accept what some of theobjectors are saying could be done or might be done, that isn't thedeal before me; that isn't my issue.  I have no power torenegotiate it, don't want to renegotiate it, even if I had thepower, and I think that what is on the table is fair, reasonableand adequate."     Should the settlement not go forward, the judge said, stateand federal courts would be confronted with a multitude of separatesuits.  "They could come down with all sorts of balkanizeddecisions, at a terrible time and terrible expense, all to whatobjective?," Judge Legge held.  "I suppose the objective is that afew people would get a little more money, but I think that's allthat would be accomplished."     As to the $5 million in proposed fees for the plaintiffattorneys, the judge noted that the work done in the state classactions helped push Chrysler into the agreement.  "Since theattorneys' work did produce a result, and since there is no adverseimpact to the class on the award of fees, and since the amount offees has been agreed to by both sides, and since the amount wasconducted in arm's-length negotiations under the supervision of(the court), I don't see any reason to substitute my personalvalues or personal opinions on what has been done...I think it'swithin the realm of reason."

MOVES CASEFROM WHAT SUZUKI CALLSATTORNEY 'HOME' DISTRICT     In a one-page order Oct. 19, the Eleventh Circuit U.S. Courtof Appeals ordered that a Suzuki Samurai stability case betransferred from the U.S. District Court for the Middle District ofGeorgia, in Columbus, to the Southern District court in Brunswick.Suzuki had argued that no connection existed between the litigationand Columbus, with the exception that plaintiff attorneys werebased in that city.  In re Suzuki Motor Corp., No. 95-9215 (11thCir.).     The case involves a 1991 collision between a Samurai andanother vehicle, after which the Samurai skidded off the road androlled over.  The driver, James Heath, suffered paralyzinginjuries.  His passenger Monica Guinn was killed.  The Guinn familyfiled suit in the Brunswick federal court and eventually agreed toa settlement.  The Heath case was filed in Columbus (Heath v.Suzuki Motor Corp., No. 4:94-cv-141).     Suzuki appealed to the 11th Circuit after three unexplainedrefusals of the Columbus judge to transfer.  The company arguedthat the only connection between the case and Columbus was that theoffices of plaintiff's attorney, James E. Butler, Jr. of Butler,Wooten, Overby, Cheeley, Pearson & Fryhofer, are located there, andthat the firm is "well-known in the community."     The defendant noted that the Guinn-Suzuki settlement was notas favorable to the plaintiffs as Butler has stated, and arguedthat Heath might have filed suit in Columbus to avoid a lessfavorable forum in Brunswick.     Suzuki also noted that many witnesses live closer to Brunswickthan to Columbus, with some located in northern Florida where theycould not be subpoenaed unless venue were changed to Brunswick,which is within the out-of-state subpoena limit of 100 miles.     In response, Butler claimed, "Suzuki wishes to escape from ajudge who has invested much time and effort in this productsliability action and who has, therefore, become wquite familiarwith the issues."  In a supplemental response to the petition,Butler said Heath was not forum-shopping and that Suzuki was merelyseeking a delay.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MICHIGAN JURY FINDS NODEFECT IN THREE-WHEEL ATV     A Michigan federal court jury returned a unanimous verdict forHonda Motor Co. defendants Dec. 7, finding that a 1985 Honda ATC-125M three-wheel all-terrain vehicle was not defective.  The juryalso found that the Honda defendants were not negligent withrespect to the design and marketing of the ATV or the warnings thataccompanied the vehicle.  Carwile v. Honda Research & DevelopmentCo.. Ltd. et al., (ED MI).               The accident occurred in April 1991 on a sandy trail nearJensen Beach, FL.  Plaintiff Manford Carwile, who was not wearinga helmet, careened into a tree after entering an S-curve andsuffered a severe closed head injury.     Plaintiff claimed that design defects made it difficult toturn the ATV, and also alleged that Honda failed to adequately warnabout the risks of operating the vehicles.  Honda countered thatCarwile's accident was caused by excessive speed, inattention, andinadequate vehicle maintenance.     Expert witnesses for the plaintiff were engineer DavidRenfroe; Edward Karnes on the adequacy of warnings; Werner Spitz,M.D., on toxicology and helmet injury-prevention; Gary Lustgarden,M.D., a neurosurgeon; Robert Ancell, a vocational rehabilitationexpert; Eric Amberg, a neuropsychologist; and economist MichaelThompson.

Norman, who claimed that a defective throttlecable in his Suzuki four-wheel all-terrain vehicle led to a loss-of-control accident in which he suffered serious injuries.  Normanv. Longshore Cycle Center et al., No. CV-93-56 (AL Cir. Ct.,Lauderdale Cty.).     Norman bought the ATV from co-defendant Longshore CycleCenter.  When riding away from a neighbor's house, he turned thehandlebars of the ATV as far to the right as he could, at whichpoint the throttle went wide open and the vehicle flew over an em-bankment.     The plaintiff went airborne, coming to rest after hitting atree and having the ATV flip over with him underneath.  Hesustained numerous cuts and abrasions on his arms and legs, andtore his right shoulder rotator cuff.  The treating orthopedicsurgeon gave him a 50-50 chance that surgery could alleviate hiscondition.     At the time of the accident, the ATV had only 50 miles of use.Norman's expert witness, Michael Burleson of Tyler, TX, testedexemplar throttle cables manufactured by Suzuki, Honda, Kawasakiand Yamaha to determine how much force was needed to cause aseparation.  All of the other brands not only out-performed theSuzuki cable, but were more substantial in appearance.     The defendants argued that the accident was caused by operatorerror and because Norman failed to take the offered free safetycourse.   Their expert witness, Kris Kubly of Madison, WI, testedthe exemplar throttle cables and the actual cable involved in theaccident and found no possibility of malfunction as claimed by theplaintiff.

USA on a claim that a defective voltageregulator caused battery acid to vaporize and injure Vaughn's lungsand vocal cords.  Vaughn v. Nissan Motor Corp. USA, No. 95-1086(4th Cir.); see Automotive LR, Dec. 6, 1994.     Vaughn claimed that her injuries occurred when the voltageregulator on her 1989 Nissan Pulsar failed in May 1991.  The SouthCarolina federal court jury rejected her claims of strict liabilityand breach of warranty.     On appeal, Vaughn argued that the trial judge erred:--      in not finding that the defect in the regulator, whichNissan did not contest, rendered the vehicle unreasonablydangerous;--      in requiring a showing that Vaughn was an "ordinaryconsumer" when she had a substantial history of treatment forphysical and mental ailments;--      in rejecting the testimony of four board-certifiedphysicians that her vocal cord dysfunction was caused by the toxicbattery fumes.  The court compounded the error by allowing Nissanto present expert testimony that the dysfunction was psychosomaticin origin, Vaughn claims.     Nissan responded that the jury credited its evidence that thedefect in the regulator and the resulting vaporization of thebattery acid did not create a level of toxicity sufficient to makethe car unreasonably dangerous.  The jury was instructed properlythat the correct analysis was whether the vapor would have beenunreasonably dangerous for a normal consumer and not for someonewho was peculiarly sensitive to the vapors, Nissan argued.     The automaker also said the judge ruled properly onadmissibility of expert testimony because no tests or scientificliterature supported their theory of a causal link between exposureto toxic fumes and vocal cord dysfunction.  Nissan compared thiswith the "wealth of documentation" supporting the defense expert'stheory that the dysfunction is almost certainly psychosomatic inthose with Vaughn's medical and psychiatric history.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUTOMOTIVE LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996REPAIR SHOP WINS VERDICTIN CA NEGLIGENCE CASE     A California state court jury Nov. 16 returned an 11-1 verdictfor a repair shop charged with negligence when a wheel came offplaintiff Linda Martin's vehicle shortly after a brake job.  Thedefendant claimed that Martin hit an object in the road or a bridgeabutment before the wheel came off.  Martin v. General Auto Repair,No. 715352 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.).     Martin took her 1988 Mitsubishi Mirage to General Auto Repairon Oct. 31, 1992 for rear brake work.  Two days later, the vehiclespun out of control and hit the bridge abutment.  The left rearwheel came off sometime during the sequence and was found at thescene.     Martin suffered neck, back and shoulder injuries requiringphysical therapy, and emotional distress requiring psychotherapy.She sought $100,000 claiming $38,000 in past medical expenses andlost earnings.  Expert witnesses for the plaintiff includedmechanical engineer Martin J. Siegel of Los Angeles and GilbertVarela, M.D., of Alhambra, CA.     General countered that the wheel had come off in an initialimpact with an object or the abutment, and not because of a faultyrepair.

GOODRICH PETITIONSCA HIGH COURT ON IMPROPERSERVICE OF SUMMONS     In a petition for review filed Dec. 11 with the CaliforniaSupreme Court, B.F. Goodrich Co. contends that it was not properlyserved with a summons in an exploding-tire case, and that the trialcourt disregarded long-standing case authority in adopting the"substantial compliance rule" and refusing to quash.  B.F. GoodrichCo. v. CA Super. Ct., Monterey Cty., No. S050529 (CA Sup. Ct.).     Goodrich says plaintiff Joseph Dinner has conceded thatservice was improper in that:--      Goodrich was not named in the complaint or by amendment;--      there was no notice pursuant to California Code of CivilProcedure Section 412.30;--      if service was attempted, no designation was made;--      the summons fails to identify on behalf of whom the personwho received the summons was served;--      no date of delivery was noted;--      the summons failed to indicate the name and capacity of theperson who allegedly received service.     Dinner claims he was injured when a Goodrich tire while beinginflated at gas station.  He then served what Goodrich calls an"admittedly defective summons" and complaint on "The B.F. GoodrichCompany," not the named defendant "B.F. Goodrich."     The Monterey County Superior Court judge refused to quash andthe state appeals court denied review.  In its petition to theCalifornia Supreme Court, Goodrich argues, "As the law is clearthat 'the substantial compliance rule' does not apply where thesummons fails to identify the individual being served on behalf ofa corporation, the trial court's ruling exceeded its jurisdiction.Therefore, based on the evidence before it, the Superior Courtabused its discretion in denying petitioner's motion to quash."     Goodrich also argues that with the advent of "fast-track"rules, courts must guard against any tendency to "move the casealong" at the expense of a potential defendant's rights.  "Wecannot trade these rights for expediency, no matter how noble thecause may be," the petition states.  "The impact of fast trackrules on trial court rulings (such as here) cannot be minimized.This case presents clear issues of first impression concerningadequate service, defective pleading and service, and the effect offast track rules on the trial court's interest in moving cases totrial within the fast track limitation framework even againstentities that are not proper parties."

Williams of the WesternDistrict of Virginia granted summary judgment Nov. 21 to RyderTruck Rental Inc. and Maxon Industries Inc. in a suit involving anallegedly defective truck lift gate.  The judge found insufficientexpert evidence on applicable industry and safety standards,consumer expectations and causation.  Lemons v. Ryder Truck RentalInc. et al., No. 93-0055 (WD VA).     Plaintiff Kenneth Lemons was injured on the job whileunloading a truck rented from Ryder and equipped with a Maxon liftgate.  The lift gate involved in the accident could not be located.Lemons' claimed that gate folded and collapsed.  His engineeringexpert testified that chains intended to support the gate were notproperly attached to the end of the lift gate platform.     Judge Williams found the testimony contradictory on whetherthere are industry standards for lift gates, citing the expert'sown admission that many different designs exist, and noting thatMaxon lift gates were identically designed with the same purporteddefect as some competing products.     The judge said the expert's testimony on safety in the absenceof an industry standard was insufficient.  For example, comparativetest results were offered without evidence about similarities inthe weight of the plates, nature of the hinge and distance betweenthe platform edge and attachment point of the support chains.     Nor did the expert establish that the Maxon lift gate violatedreasonable consumer expectations, the opinion states, havingpresented no evidence of noncompliance with actual industrypractices, no knowledge by the defendants of other injuries ordangers, no published literature and no direct evidence of actualconsumer expectations.     Judge Williams said Lemons failed to demonstrate that the liftgate was in the same condition at the time of the accident as itwas when it left either Maxon's or Ryder's control.  The judgenoted that Lemons' employer had previously modified lift gates onvarious trucks rented from Ryder.               Finally, the court found no evidence that the expert'sproffered alternative design was technically feasible anddesirable.  Judge Williams also questioned the expert'sprofessional credentials but did not exclude his testimony becausethe defendants failed to make an exclusion motion.     Lemons was represented by D.

Lauderdale to Ohio in his propane-fueled pickup as aperfect opportunity to test the infrastructure for alternativefuels.In the March issue of BUTANE-PROPANE NEWS, McCrea reports on histrip, which -- with side-trips to New England and Long Island --covered 5,292 miles and consumed 178 gallons of propane.  McCreareported that 60% of the driving was on propane in the dual-fueltruck -- accounting for 3026 miles at 17 mpg.Fuel stops were not always an easy proposition, McCrea says, becausethe "National Directory of Propane Refueling Stations" was notgeographically helpful to a stranger in a given region.  Add to thatthe fact that many propane dealers close early, making refuelingafter 5 p.m. problematic and limiting the use of propane to about800 miles of driving in 24 hours.A refueling stop, which included finding the fuel seller, averagedan hour, McCrea found.  Prices varied, averaging around $1.50 pergallon, but cost more at campgrounds because owners charge the sameprice for motor fuel as for barbecue grill propane.DOE-provided tax incentives bring conversion costs down, whilesporting an AFV decal brings the average cost of refueling down atthe pump -- to around $1.06 per gallon (in Florida), or about 14cents less than gasoline, said McCrea.McCrea's primary goal was to prove a road trip could be taken onpropane, "but hundreds of Canadians already know this," he pointsout.  His second objective was to spread the word about DOE'stoll-free AFV Hotline (800/423-1363), which he had emblazoned on theside of his car.  His third goal was to simply test theinfrastructure.McCrea strongly suggests that propane directories in the futureshould include maps to help find the stations and highway offrampsigns should include "LPG" in addition to gas/diesel.(BUTANE-PROPANE NEWS: MARCH 1995, p.42,43)Back to Headline List CopyrightALTERNATIVE FUELS ONLINE TODAY via NewsNetApril 3, 1995ExproFuels, ATI Sign Contract for CNG Conversions in UzbekistanIn March, the Exploration Company announced it had signed aparticipation agreement through its ExproFuels Division with theAmerican Technical Institute (ATI) and the American Engineering Inc.(AEI) of Memphis, Tenn. to provide technical evaluation, projectmanagement, and assistance for its joint venture with the governmentof Uzbekistan.The Uzbekistan project envisions the total conversion of Uzbekistan'sgovernment fleet of 350,000 vehicles to run on natural gas.

"The CleanAir Act sets standards which we have met by setting good requirements for both mobile and stationary sources.  We have exercised our rights under the Clean Air Act, passed a Massachusetts Clean Air Law, and set the requirements for low and zero emission vehicles.  That's that," Coxe said.Boston Edison Co. has endorsed Weld's unwavering position on theretention of clean air mandates and support for EV development inMassachusetts."The Governor clearly recognizes that elimination of the clear airmandates could have multiple negative impacts on Massachusetts,"said Carl Gustin, Boston Edison senior vice president.  "Without the environmental benefits of electric vehicles, business and industries in the Commonwealth could face stiffer environmental requirements in order for the state to comply with the Clean Air Act."Backing away from the EV mandates could place a huge obstacle in thepath of plans to manufacture EVs and the components in South Boston,Gustin pointed out.

The proposal, which is still in outline form, suggests substituting a demonstration of 3,750 ZEVs just in Sacramento and Los Angeles for a two percent statewide mandate, which would put 60,000 ZEVs on the road.Coalition for Clean Air representative Tim Carmichael said his groupsees "no scientific or technical reason to delay" implementation.And Melissa Kaznitz, of CALPIRG, accused Wilson of "selling out the environment, high-tech business and consumers to support his generous patrons in the oil industry."The two percent figure is intended to be the first step toward a 10percent requirement for the year 2003.The proposal leaves the 10 percent figure intact, but environmentalgroups worry that without the incremental step, car companies willnot take the 10 percent mandate seriously.  "From zero to 10 percent is a giant leap," said Jamie Phillips of the Planning and Conservation League.  "It requires a leap of faith in the car companies, in whom we have little faith."(EIN STAFF: 01/03)Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRIC VEHICLE ONLINE TODAY via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996Project Puts Waste Oil to WorkA project at the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT)  recentlyuncovered a way to produce hydrogen using waste motor oil and steam,a development that could radically change the hydrogen fuel cell industry.IGT researchers employed the steam-and-waste-oil process to producea sulfur-tolerant catalyst that produces hydrogen.  The procedurehas been used successfully in the past with liquid feed stocks like jet fuel, diesel and coal liquids, but the abundance and minimal cost of waste oil makes this latest accomplishment particularly attractive.The researchers still got 100 percent conversion of the oil evenwhen trace metal contaminants were present, meaning waste oil wouldnot need to be cleaned before use.The results are good news for the environment as well.  Currently,only about 30 to 40 percent of used oil is recycled; the rest isburned or thrown away.  The new process could potentially covert all the unrecycled oil into useable, clean-burning hydrogen.

The study, Natural Gas Vehicles: Helping Ensure America's EnergySecurity, predicts that efforts to place two million NGVs on U.S. roads wouldcreate tens of thousands of new jobs and save billions of dollars in fuel costsfor the United States. Additionally, the study forecasts such an effort wouldreduce America's balance of trade by $7.3 billion and U.S. oil imports by atleast 2.2%.  The report cites government projections indicating that nearly 75%of U.S. oil consumption will be foreign-sourced by the year 2010. Furthermore,study authors project the unthinkable   that the U.S. Department of Defense mayeventually be forced into using foreign oil. "Should this occur, U.S. forceswould be left hostage to the good will of foreign suppliers for one of theirmost essential military supplies."

Nine percent of local government fleets in 1994included vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline or diesel fuel, while 1%of private company fleets included alternative-fuel vehicles. Twenty percent ofmunicipal fleet managers had plans to purchase or convert vehicles to usealternative fuels during 1995 and 3% of private company fleets reported AFVplans for the year.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration survey of102,140 private companies and local government agencies in the city shows thatalternative-fueled vehicles comprised 1% of all fleets, compared to 69% of thevehicles using gasoline and 30% using diesel fuel. Viewed by fleet ownership,the fuel distribution ratio shows private fleets consisted of 70% gasolinevehicles, 29% diesel-fueled vehicles and 1% AFVs, while municipal fleets had63% of their vehicles running on gasoline, 36% on diesel, and 1% on alternativefuels.  Private company fleets included an estimated 83,000 conventional fuelvehicles with light-duty vehicles making up almost 70% of the total. Of nearly19,000 gasoline and diesel fuel vehicles in municipal fleets, 60% were light-duty vehicles.  How far fleet vehicles need to travel before refueling was ofinterest in this survey because AFVs tend to offer shorter ranges thanconventionally-fueled vehicles, EIA says. One measure of required fleet vehiclerange is average daily mileage. The survey found that one-third of privatefleet vehicles travel less than 100 miles per day.  Also, centrally-fueledfleets may find it easier to supply alternative fuel on-site. Eight-fivepercent of local government fleets with gasoline vehicles and 80% of those withdiesel vehicles fueled them at a central government-owned site. Ten percent ofprivate fleets with gasoline vehicles and 20% with diesel vehicles fueled themon-site.  The survey was designed to draw a profile of private and localgovernment fleets in a major metropolitan area and gauge the effectiveness ofthe Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which wereexpected to boost AFV purchases for use in fleets. The survey site, Atlanta,was the first metropolitan area designated a "Clean City" by the U.S.Department of Energy.

With an eye toward building fleets of electricvehicles to be made available as rentals to the public, Renault is currentlytesting a dozen EV prototypes, some supplied by local equipment suppliers.Soterem's electric Vetela is one of these.  The 3-door, 2-passenger Vetela is ahybrid electric vehicle based on the all-wheel drive Citroen AX. Built undercontract to the French Ministry of Research and Higher Education, Soterem'sdevelopmental Vetela replaces the Citroen's rear axle assembly with an air-cooled 15 kW AC electric motor; a water-cooled variant will be used in newerprototypes. Speed reduction gearing and a single-speed transmission transferpower to the wheels.  Power is supplied by 15 Oldham 12-volt, 36 amp-hoursealed lead-acid batteries. A front-mounted 1.4-liter internal combustionengine fueled by a 11.3-gallon gasoline tank also produces electricity to powerthe car's electric motor for extended travel, or motivates the car viaconventional IC power only. Electric-only range is a claimed 19 miles, with a354 mile range provided via hybrid electric propulsion.  Acceleration isreported to be about average with a 0-60 mph sprint accomplished in 11.4seconds in hybrid mode. Electric-only acceleration is a sluggish 0-30 mph in 22seconds. A top speed of 103 mph is claimed.  Importantly, the Frenchengineering company has achieved its electric hybrid transformation with a verymanageable weight penalty, a claim that can't always be made by electricvehicle upfitters.

Key to the plan is a law that bans certain vehicles from the road ondesignated days between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m., based on the last digit of thecar's license plate.  According to the study, gasoline consumption in the areaaround Mexico City has increased by about a half-million gallons per day overthe past six years. Furthermore, air pollution in the city is said to be at itsworst level.  The problem is said to be exacerbated by the law. To avoid therule, some drivers have purchased additional vehicles, driving them when theirprimary car cannot be used. To make matters worse, these purchases havecontributed to the 50 percent increase of vehicles on the road since the lawtook effect.  Mexico City's environmental commission plans to maintain the ruleuntil new ones can be passed. Possible plans include incentives for installingcatalytic converters, which currently are not required in Mexico.Back to Headline List CopyrightGREEN CAR JOURNAL via NewsNetJANUARY 1996GM SETTLES CADILLAC EMISSIONS CASE WITH EPA.General Motors has agreed to spend about $45million to settle U.S. Environmental Protection Agency charges that itinstalled illegal computer chips that allowed 470,000 Cadillacs made since 1991to defeat federally-required emissions controls. Those cars now produce up tothree times the legal limit of carbon monoxide.  In settling the case, thelargest ever brought by the Justice Department under the Clean Air Act, GMagreed to pay an $11 million fine, spend more than $25 million to recall andretrofit the polluting vehicles, and spend up to $8.75 million on emission-offset projects such as buying back older vehicles or purchasing new schoolbuses that burn cleaner fuels.  The case began with an EPA investigation thatshowed the Cadillac "defeat devices" resulted in illegal emissions of about100,000 tons of excess carbon monoxide pollution. The agreement, filed infederal District Court in Washington, D.C., resolved government allegationsthat GM sold vehicles that did not conform to CAA rules, made and sold vehiclesequipped with illegal defeat devices, tampered with certain 1991 and 1992model-year Cadillacs, and failed to describe the use of emission-controldevices to EPA.  The allegations centered on GM's 1991-1995 model yearCadillacs, including Seville and Deville models equipped with 4.9-literengines. An additional claim involved GM's failure to notify EPA about certainemission control strategies for light-duty vehicles sold in model years 1991-1995.  During routine testing in fall 1993, EPA discovered that the Cadillacsfailed to comply with federal emissions requirements. EPA tests showed that theengines emitted up to 10 grams of CO per mile with the climate control onwell above the 3.4 gram/mile limit. In 1990, GM designed a new engine controlcomputer chip to respond to customer complaints of stalling and other driveproblems in the 1991 Cadillacs.  The device nearly tripled the output of COwhen the car's heater or air conditioner was turned on. The instructions on thecomputer chip enriched the fuel/air ratio, which overrode the emissions controlsystem and resulted in the higher pollution. For the 1993-1995 models, GM againfailed to disclose the use of the device or its effects on emissions, theJustice Department said.  "Carbon monoxide can cause cardiopulmonary problemsand can lead to headaches, impaired vision, and a reduced ability to work andlearn," says Attorney General Janet Reno. "These so-called defeat devices arenot just paper violations, but result in real increases in emissions thataffect real people." Adds U.S. EPA Administrator Carol Browner: "These illegaldevices caused enough additional air pollution to blanket a major U.S. city,such as Washington, D.C., with a 10-foot layer of CO." Because the vehiclecertification program relies on complete and accurate information fromautomobile manufacturers, "GM's conduct jeopardized the integrity of theprogram," says assistant EPA administrator for air enforcement and complianceassurance Steven Harman.Back to Headline List CopyrightGREEN CAR JOURNAL via NewsNetJANUARY 1996U.S. DOE REQUESTS REAUTHORIZATION OF AFV PROGRAM.A topU.S. Department of Energy official has formally asked Congress to reauthorizeprograms aimed at boosting alternative-fuel use for heavy-duty vehicles.  TheAlternative-Fuels Truck Commercial Application Program, which a House panel isreviewing for reauthorization under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act(EPCA), contributes substantial value toward advancement of alternative fueltransportation technologies necessary to meet EPCA goals, says C. Kyle Simpson,DOE's associate deputy secretary for Energy Programs. The program's purpose isto reduce U.S.  reliance on imported oil and lessen the environmental impactsof energy use in transportation. Simpson addressed the Commerce Committee'sSubcommittee on Energy and Power last month.  The program develops andimplements demonstrations of heavy-duty vehicles using field-test enginesoperating on alternative fuels. The goal is to move heavy-duty alternative fuelengine technology toward commercialization and widen awareness and acceptanceof alternative fuels in heavy-duty applications. In addition, as commercialtechnology becomes available, the program will evaluate the performance, cost,and emissions of AFVs compared to conventional diesel and gasoline vehicles.Under the program, DOE is cooperating with municipalities, state and localgovernments, other federal agencies, and private fleet operators to test thereal-life operation of vehicles running on alternative fuels. The program teststrucks running on methanol, ethanol, compressed natural gas, biodiesel, andpropane. Because heavy-duty trucks typically are very expensive, the cost oftest vehicles is shared with private fleet owners or state or localgovernments.  The program consists of more than 350 alternative-fuel, heavy-duty vehicles and 40 control vehicles. These vehicles are located in 26 statesand include local delivery trucks, line haul trucks, garbage packers, dumptrucks, snow plows, airport shuttles, street sweepers, and school buses.  JohnNunley, representing the National Association of State Energy Officials,recommended continued support of Georgia Division of Energy Resources' AFVprogram, which uses DOE funds to encourage local governments and authorities toconvert to alternative fuel sources.

Its aim is to enable Canadian corporations,governments, and even U.S. and other non-Canadian corporations to pool moneyfor specific research projects or for development of EV components and systems.The program is expected to enhance Canada's involvement in EVs in several ways.Among them: Facilitating pre-competitive research among competing corporationsand helping to create industrial alliances for the joint-venture development ofproducts that will benefit Canadian and provincial economies.  IncreasingCanada's expertise in EV research and development is also considered a likelyresult, as is the creation of spin-off companies with viable marketableproducts for the electric vehicle field.  The program is expected to providethe government with a better structure for selecting programs for matchingfunds. The decision on which projects to sponsor will be 100% market-driven,says Bill Adams, EVAC R&D Committee chairman and president of ESTCO Energy,Inc. He adds that corporate sponsors must also be willing to fund a minimum of50% of a project's cost in order to be considered for matching funding from thegovernment.

Scientists at Stuttgart's Center for Solar Energy and HydrogenResearch (ZSW) are confident that their project will be successful.  Not onlyis CO2 recyclable, they say, but the process also would reduce air pollution byshrinking the amount of that greenhouse gas in the air. Furthermore, theprocess can be a virtual closed-loop operation: When methanol is burned as afuel it releases CO2, which once again can be captured and recycled.  Theprocess is a chemical reaction with hydrogen gained through solar energy, whichconverts CO2 into methanol. By mid-1996 ZSW will have constructed a pump inStuttgart to carry out this conversion into methanol. The commercial aspect isparticularly attractive, proponents say. Not only will the fuel be cheap toproduce, but under present German law it will be tax-free, unlike heavily-taxedgasoline and diesel.Back to Headline List CopyrightGREEN CAR JOURNAL via NewsNetJANUARY 1996NPGA MANUAL FOR PROPANE VEHICLE INSTALLATIONS.TheAmerican Society for Advanced Fuels Technology has worked with the NationalPropane Gas Association and the U.S. Dept. of Energy to create a revised andupdated NPGA Guidebook 6 (NPGA item #4100), which is intended to serve as astandardized curriculum for training auto technicians in propane vehicleinstallations.Revision of the 136-page guidebook, which offers details on conversions, LPGequipment and electronics, and engines, was handled at College of the Desert's(Palm Desert, Calif.)

The reports are part of a seven-part series.  Repair andReuse of Automotive Plastic Parts concludes that automobile bumpers are themost repaired component due to strong markets, ease of repair, and availabilityof repair techniques. However, many technicians avoid repair of plasticcomponents because such work is not competitive with the cost of a new part.The report also notes that the Inter-Industry Council on Automotive Repair andthe Automotive Recyclers Association can play "pivotal" roles in increasing thequantity of plastic parts recovered and the amount of plastic reused. DisposalPractices for Post-Use Automotive Plastics outlines current disposal practicesfor dismantlers, wreckers, shredders, nonferrous-metal separators, repairshops, processors, and component suppliers and tracks automotive plasticsthrough these shops to landfills. The report also finds that polypropylene (PP)from automotive battery cases is the only automotive plastic componentcommercially recycled. After recovery of the lead used in batteries, more than100 million pounds of PP from battery cases is reclaimed annually.  Economicsof Recovery and Recycling discusses development of an economic model for thecommercial infrastructure required for recovering plastics from the 10 millionvehicles junked annually in the U.S.  Sorting and Processing AutomotivePlastics - Emerging Technologies concludes that creating a U.S. industry whichrecycles significant quantities of automotive polymers from scrap vehicles"will require a tremendous technological effort." Also, the report points outthat new businesses for collection and processing need to be created beforesignificant recycling of automotive polymers takes place.

The refuelingappliance is capable of filling a 12.5 gallon gaseous fuel tank in less than 21/2 hours.  Targeted will be domestic home users and urban transportationcompanies. The export market also appeals to Sanyo, which has its eye onSoutheast Asian countries where natural gas is widely available. Sales areexpected to commence imminently.  The Japanese government reportedly plans toencourage the growth of NGVs on that nation's highways to as many as 200,000units by the year 2000, spending some $19 million (2 billion yen) inimplementing its program.Back to Headline List CopyrightGREEN CAR JOURNAL via NewsNetJANUARY 1996LNG SEEN AS OPTIMAL FOR SOME AIRPORT VEHICLES.While compressednatural gas could best meet the needs of smaller vehicles at an airport,liquefied natural gas (LNG) "would be the fuel of choice for buses and largevehicles," says Lloyd W. Klefstad, Construction and Maintenance Bureau chief atLos Angeles International Airport (LAX).  "The Department of Airports wants tobe a good neighbor to our surrounding communities, and one way is to helpreduce emissions in and around [LAX]," adds Klefstad. "LAX is certainly aleader in incorporating low-emissions vehicles into our fleet." A fleet of 677vehicles including light-duty trucks, 56 parking-lot shuttle buses, and 17airfield buses is currently in use at the airport. This creates quite apotential for integration of alternative fuels into the mix. An average of65,000 vehicles travel to and from LAX daily.  Several federal and statelegislative and administrative actions affect the operation of these vehicles,Klefstad points out. In its effort to be responsive to environmental concerns,the board of airport commissioners is addressing the air-quality problems inthe Los Angeles Basin. After conducting a comprehensive evaluation in 1990 ofalternative fuels for the fleet, the Department of Airports concluded that noone fuel best meets its requirements.  A year later, based on the department'sresearch and experience, it was determined that propane or CNG would be bestfor buses and large vehicles. However, further study pointed to CNG alone asbest for many of the vehicles.  Following two years of additionalinvestigations into costs, maintenance, training, facility requirements, air-quality impacts and safety of CNG and propane vehicles, the departmentconcluded that LNG would be appropriate for buses and larger vehicles due toweight considerations and range. For shuttle service the airport uses atransit-type bus with seating and standing capacity for 40 passengers and theirluggage.  Airfield buses are 130-passenger diesel people-movers.  To date, LAXhas replaced 14 diesel transit buses one-for-one with LNG models and has eightmore on order. The buses have an L10-240G Cummins engine and are outfitted witha 145-gallon MVE fuel tank and a saturated-type fueling system, providing ausable 125 gallons of fuel. An initial computerized fleet-maintenancecomparison shows the diesel buses average 3.5 miles per gallon compared to 1.5-1.8 mpg for the LNG buses, which receive 50-60 gallons of the less expensiveLNG in daily refueling.  As the LNG buses were broken in and operations furthermodified, efficiency rose to a fleet average of 1.95 mpg.  Southern CaliforniaGas Co., the fuel provider, selected Cryenco to build the station, whichconsists of two 5,300-gallon fuel tanks on skids, plus plumbing and pumps. Thedepartment has issued a solicitation for a permanent station, scheduled to bein operation within a year. The new station also will fuel CNG vehicles andother equipment, and serve other agencies, airport tenants, airlines, and thepublic.  The department plans to replace its remaining 42 diesel buses and 17airfield buses with LNG models over the next several years. This year, theagency will seek bids on six transit buses and a similar number of airfieldbuses, with an option for six additional airfield buses.  Meanwhile, thedepartment is evaluating its other large vehicles as candidates for LNGvariants on a replacement basis and is negotiating to purchase a Class 7 or 8truck-tractor. Sedans and pickups also are being replaced with CNG vehicles,and to date 30 pickup trucks and three sedans have been converted to thisgaseous fuel. Beyond that, the department is involved in a hybrid bus projectthat will use a constant-speed, LNG-fueled turbine engine driving an electricgenerator to power electric traction motors.Back to Headline List CopyrightGREEN CAR JOURNAL via NewsNetJANUARY 1996FIAT, ROVER TEAM IN VEHICLE RECYCLING.Agreement Fiat Auto and RoverGroup will collect and treat discarded cars within each manufacturer'srecycling program in Italy and Britain under a cooperative agreement the firmsrecently penned.  Fiat's auto-recycling project (F.A.RE) is a closed-looprecycling system with outlets for reuse determined in advance. The program aimsto create no pollution or waste and use resources optimally via innovativedesign and production methods. Fiat says its "design for recycling" assuresmaximum recyclability, while its "design for dismantling" reduces the cost ofdisassembly and reflects the future-oriented philosophy behind F.A.RE.  F.A.REalready has spread throughout France and Germany via accords with Renault andBMW. Launched in 1992 in northern Italy, F.A.RE has expanded to 80 plantsnationwide with 20 more planned by year's end. These facilities are associatedwith the National Association of Car Dismantlers.  The plants separate glass,plastic, and seat padding, which are then collected by other companiesparticipating in the F.A.RE program. The materials are transformed into newcomponents for the car market and other industrial sectors. More than 100,000cars have gone through the recycling process, resulting in about 3,200 tons ofrecycled non-metallic materials and more than 69,000 tons of metals since 1992.Nearly 1,900 tons of glass have helped produce 3 million bottles, while 580tons of plastic bumper material has reemerged in the form of more than 230,000air channels for the Tipo and Punto models. Additionally, about 746 tons ofseat padding has contributed to 825,000 square meters of carpeting.Back to Headline List CopyrightGREEN CAR JOURNAL via NewsNetJANUARY 1996PATENTS INTELLIGENCE.Full patent copies from the World Patents Index may beordered directly from the "International Patent Copies" service of DerwentPublications Ltd., Derwent House, 14 Great Queen Street, London, WC2B 5DF, UK.Tel: +44.71.344.2800; Telex: 267487 DERPUB G; Fax: +44.71.344.2900.

The novelty is that the NOx is mixed with the suctionair for reaction in the combustion chamber of the engine.  NOx is adsorbed anddesorbed alternately in two parallel adsorbers. The hot gas from the adsorbercan be used for desorption. For a compression engine with a catalyst in theexhaust pipe, excess air is used in the adsorption phase and a stoichiometricmixture for the desorption phase and a small amount of the exhaust gas streamis passed to the adsorber in the desorption phase, while the rest passesdirectly to the catalyst.
