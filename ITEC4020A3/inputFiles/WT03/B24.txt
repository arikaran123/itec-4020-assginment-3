Their mission was so successful that they madeit a point to be present during the subsequent summers, and in 1994 theybrought along with them the rest of the army - Claudio Bettini andLuigi Mancini. During this period, the Italian team has been involved mostly with ProfessorJajodia and other affiliates of the Center for Secure Information Systems.The research work has focused on several topics related to database security,including transaction management in multilevel systems, extended authorizationmodels, and to temporal databases. Their stay has been very productive withthe publication of a number of papers in various conferences as well asjournals. In order to cement this relationship, Professor Jajodia spent a glorious(his words!) month this May at the University of Milan. He also had an opportunityto visit the University of Genova. Brief biosketches of the visitors aregiven below. Elisa Bertino is professor of computer sciencein the Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Informazione of the University of Milanwhere she heads the Database Systems Group.

Mr. SoonamKahng is currently the laboratory administrator. LIST's mission is to provide dedicated computing and networking facilitiesfor experimental research in information security (INFOSEC). ExperimentalINFOSEC research requires modification and enhancement of low-level systemsoftware including the operating system kernel, operating system servicesand network protocols at all layers. Such experimentation is not conduciveto simultaneous "production" use of the same facilities. Hence,the importance of providing dedicated equipment for this purpose. LIST is a corporate internetwork in the miniature. Currently the LIST subnetconsists of SUN workstations and NCD X-terminals. Plans to incorporate WindowsNT, Novell, Windows 95 and Macintosh computers are in progress. LIST facilities are available to SITE Graduate Students for experimentalINFOSEC research. Students interested in using LIST equipment should contactDr. Sandhu (sandhu@isse.gmu.edu)or Soonam Kahng (soonam@isse.gmu.edu)to discuss possible projects. LIST facilities are also available for joint projects with industrial partners. Breaking News Professor Sandhu has been elected Chairman of ACM's Special Interest Groupon Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC). SIGSAC recently (1993) launchedthe highly successful ACM Conference on Computer and CommunicationsSecurity, giving itself a much needed annual flagship conference. Raviis looking for volunteers and suggestions on additional SIGSAC activities(send him email at sandhu@isse.gmu.edu).

These new information systems embody knowledge that allows them to exhibitintelligent behavior, cooperate with users and other systems in problemsolving, discovery, access, retrieval and manipulation of a wide varietyof multimedia data and knowledge, and reason under uncertainty. Increasingly,knowledge-directed inference processes are being used to: discover knowledge from large data collections, provide cooperative support to users in complex query formulationand refinement, access, retrieve, store and manage large collections of multimediadata and knowledge, integrate information from multiple heterogeneous data and knowledgesources, and reason about information under uncertain conditions. Multimedia and hypermedia information systems now operate on a global scaleover the Internet, and new tools and techniques are needed to manage thesedynamic and evolving information spaces. JIIS provides a forum wherein academics, researchers and practitioners maypublish high-quality, original and state-of-the-art papers describing theoreticalaspects, systems architectures, analysis and design tools and techniques,and implementation experiences in Intelligent Information Systems. The categoriesof papers published by JIIS include: research papers, invited papers, meeting, workshop and conference announcements and reports, survey and tutorialarticles, and book reviews. Short articles describing open problems or theirsolutions are also welcome. Scope of JIIS Topics of interest to JIIS include, but are not limited to the following: Foundations and principles of data, information, and knowledge models, Methodologies for IIS analysis, design, implementation, validation,maintenance and evolution, User Models, intelligent and cooperative query languages and interfaces, Knowledge representation, integration, fusion, interchange and evolution, Intelligent databases, object-oriented, extended-relational, logic-based,active databases, and constraint management, Intelligent information retrieval, digital libraries, and networkedinformation retrieval, Distributed multimedia and hypermedia information space design, implementationand navigation, Visual interfaces, visual query languages, and visual expressivenessof IIS, Machine Learning, knowledge discovery, and data mining, Uncertainty Management and reasoning under uncertainty, Applications and Case Studies in novel applications, e.g., globalchange, scientific databases, human genome project, Earth Observing System,manufacturing, telemedicine, education, etc.) We seek papers that improve on the best academic research or the best industrialpractice. Submitted papers should be motivated by the problems they addresswith compelling examples from real or potential applications. Systems papersmust contain interpreted experimentation results either on real systemsor simulations based on representative traces from real systems. Papersfrom industrial organizations that discuss implementation of systems andtheir use in practice are welcome. Proposals for special issues, especiallyon emerging topics, are welcome.

Combining databases with active rules yields flexible and powerful systems that can exhibit a wide range of reactive behavior and that can perform inferencing over massive data. Over the past several years there has been a great surge of interest in active database systems, with numerous useful research results, prototypes, and commercial products. In view of the rapidly growing importance of active database systems, a special issue of the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, planned for fall 1996, will be devoted to topics in this area. Papers are solicited in, but not limited to, the following topics: Active database event and rule languages and processing, Active database system architecture and implementation issues, Performance evaluation of active database systems, Temporal and real-time aspects of active database systems, Theoretical foundations of active database systems, Active database design issues and application development, Deployment of active database technology on real applications, and Relationship between expert systems, knowledge-base systems, and active database systems The Journal The mission of the JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS: Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Database Technologies is to present research and development focused on the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Database Management technologies to provide models, architectures, tools, and techniques for the next generation of systems -- Intelligent Information Systems. The journal focuses on the creation of information systems that exhibit intelligent behavior and embody intelligence in their reasoning and management processes. The journal is an archival, peer-reviewed, technical journal publishing high-quality, state-of-the-art papers. Instructions for Submitting Papers Manuscripts are strictly limited to 25 printed pages with a 12-point font and 18-point spacing (approximately 12,000 words), including all figures and references.

Type or mark mathematical expressions exactly as they should appearin print. In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate typefaces. Otherwise,journal style and the corresponding indication for equations is as follows:variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, Roman font type,matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy underline). It willbe assumed that letters in equations are to be set in italic type unlessyou mark them otherwise. All letter symbols in text discussion must be markedif they should be italic or boldface. STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS Originals for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and of goodcontrast. We regret that we cannot provide drafting or art service. Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India ink onpaped. Use 8 1/2 X 11 inch size sheets if possible, to simplify handlingof the manuscript. Each figure should be mentioned in the text, and numbered consecutivelyusing Arabic Numerals. Specify the desired location of each figure in thetext, but place the figure itself on a separate page following the text. Number each table consecutively using Arabic Numerals. Please labelany material that can be typeset as a table, reserving the term "figure"for material that has been drawn. Specify the desired location of each tablein the text, but place the table itself on a separate page following thetext. Type a brief title below each table. Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in proper stylefor the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the fault coverage ofrandom vectors in (a) combinational and (b) sequential circuits." All lettering should be large enough to permit legible reduction (atleast 10pt.). Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and gradation,and any reasonable size. We will publish full color photographs, but onlywith the authors understanding and acceptance that they will be expectedto finance the extra cost of the color reproduction. Number each original lightly, in pencil, on the back so that theymay be matched up correctly with the Table and Figure locations in the text.

As the complexityof modern computer-based systems has increased, there is growing demand forinformation systems skills. In employment, the capable information systems specialist may be givenresponsibility for development of systems architecture, system standards,database design and implementation, network design, the overall systemdevelopment plan, integration, integrated testing, or operational management ofinformation systems. The responsibilities often involve managerial duties,development of proposals, financial planning, and interaction with the client,with correspondingly greater financial rewards than are available in lesscritical aspects of the work. Breadth of knowledge and ability to communicatewell are both especially important, as the information systems professional mustdeal with specialists as well as non-technical individuals.

DCCP is dccp@eff.org, amailing list for DC-area cypherpunks and others with interestes in privacy, cryptography, security, and networking. Sincethe "networking" interests are in both the technical, electronic meaningof the word, and the social and interpersonal meaning of the word, weoccasionally meet physically. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been kind enough to set up a mailing list on their node, eff.org. The term "dccp" is a mixed choice. It is the obvious contractionof DC CypherPunks. Lots of the members are in thegreater Washington DC area. The locals in this area use the term "DC"when they mean the city, Washington, DC, that is the capitol ofthe US. The term is used mostly because it is short, and partlyto differentiate it from Washington State, or towns likeWashington, Virginia. Dccp is actually larger than its name. Many of the folks on the list arefrom farther away. We regularly see folks from Baltimore, and peoplehave traveled from as far away as New York, NY. to attend our meetings. Who is in charge? In short, no one. There is no list of members, no officers, no voting rules,etc. Folks who are interested in organizing a meeting, do so, and announce it.The founders of the main cypherpunks list are crypto-anarchists, manyon the dccp are too, although no single label does justice to such a diverse goup.

McConnell [Initials] Edward J. Appel [Initials] Co-Chairs, Interagency Working Group on Cryptography Policy Attached for your review and comment is a draft paperentitled "Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and PublicSafety in the Global Information Infrastructure." It presentsa vision and course of action for developing a cryptographicinfrastructure that will protect valuable information onnational and international networks. The draft paper is the result of the many discussions wehave had with interested parties concerning the use ofencryption. While those discussions have explored the use ofboth key recoverable encryption and non-recoverableencryption, the draft paper addresses an infrastructure whichuses key recoverable encryption. We believe such a keymanagement infrastructure, voluntary and supported by *privatesector* key management organizations, is the prospect of thenear future. It would permit users and manufacturers freechoice of encryption algorithm, facilitate internationalinteroperability, preserve law enforcement access, and, mostimportantly, provide strong system security and integrity. Recognizing that a robust infrastructure is not yet areality, we are also considering measures to liberalize exportpolicy for some non-escrowed products. Appendix II of thedraft paper begins to summarize current policy, and we intendto expand and improve that section. We believe that clearly articulating such a vision willaccelerate the ability of the United States to realize thefull advantages of the global network for commerce, securityand public safety. However, such a vision cannot become areality unless it is widely shared. Therefore, rather thanbeing a finished product, the attached paper is a draft whichwe ask you to help us improve. We hope it will contribute toconstructive discussion and promote a clearer understanding ofeach others' needs and concerns regarding the use ofencryption. We welcome your comments and look forward to furtherdiscussion. Written comments may be sent to our attention,Room 10236, NEOB, Washington, D.C. 20503. [End cover letter] [Note: All 25 pages of the typeset report have the word "Draft" printed in large letters across the text.] [Head note of report] Last Modified: May 17, 1996 Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in theGlobal Information Infrastructure Statement of the Issue This paper outlines a course of action for developing aninfrastructure that will protect valuable national informationresources on national and international networks. Governmentand industry must work together to create a securitymanagement infrastructure and attendant products thatincorporate robust cryptography without undermining nationalsecurity and public safety. A policy for escrow ofcryptographic keys which provides a basis for bilateral andmultilateral government agreements must be determined so thatindustry can produce products for worldwide interoperability.Industry will participate in defining algorithms and protocolstandards, and will develop key escrow encryption productssuitable for the protection of both government and privatesector information and which will assure timely, lawful,government decryption access. Government will help setstandards for the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) anddeliver a market for robust security products. A KMIinfrastructure and attendant key escrow products will providemany benefits, both domestic and internationally, as the USbegins to realize the advantages of the global network forimprove commerce, security and public safety. I. Introduction Government can no longer monopolize state of the artcryptography. It is no longer acceptable to argue that theonly information of a compelling national security interest isgovernment information. It is unrealistic to believe thatgovernment can produce solutions which keep ahead of today'srapdily changing information technology. Increasingly, allinstitutions, military, civil, or corporate, will communicateacross common links. The nation's commerce is moving tonetworking. With these enormous changes, means must be foundto responsibly raise the quality of cryptographic serviceswithout jeopardizing effective law enforcement, imperilingpublic safety. Industry and government must partner in the developmentof a public key-based key management infrastructure andattendant products that will assure participants can transmitand receive information electronically with confidence in theinformation's integrity, authenticity, and origin and whichwill assure timely lawful government access. When we conducttransactions, we rely on face-to-face interactions, orobtaining a signature on a paper, to have confidence thatcommitments will be fulfilled. Policies and infrastructure areneeded to assure we can have at least the same degree ofconfidence when we interact electronically. Government bearsa significant responsibility to ensure the informationinfrastructure has the features that are essential to suchconfidence. There is a more compelling rationale for the governmentto be a partner in the development of the KMI. Not only hasthe Information Age sparked fundamental changes in the way weinteract, but reliance on information systems makes ourinstitutions vulnerable to an unprecedented degree. Almost allinstitutions upon which public safety and national securitydepend, ranging from the power grid to military command andcontrol, are at severe risk because of their presence in anddependence upon a global information infrastructure. But the proliferation of quality cryptographic servicesis not without risk. Keys can be lost, stolen, or forgotten --rendering encrypted data useless. Additionally, the widespreaduse of encryption without safety features such as key recoverycan pose serious risks to society. It will put at riskimportant law enforcement and national security investigationswhere electronic surveillance and search and seizure areessential in preserving and prosecuting crimes, and moreimportantly, in saving human life. Public key cryptography allows for secure authenticatedtransactions with any party, known or unknown, with assuranceof data integrity and non-repudiation of the transaction.These features, together with increased network reliability,are needed to support electronic commerce, public services,redefined business processes and national security. But toachieve its promise, public key cryptography must be based ona key management infrastructure and attendant products thattie individual and coprorate identities to their public keythrough a series of Certificate Authorities (CA). The keymanagement infrastructure to do this on a global scale will bevery large and complex, but it is an essential foundation.Without a KMI of trusted certificate authorities, users cannotknow with whom they are dealing on the network, or sendingmoney to, or who signed a document, or if the document wasintercepted and changed by a third part. Therefore, users willdemand a strong key management infrastructure, which may, inturn, be based on a voluntary system of commercial certificateauthorities (CAs) operating within prescribed policy andperformance guidelines. To achieve the environment for such anapproach, a number of principles need to be accepted bygovernment, industry, and other users: Participation in the KMI will be voluntary. Key escrow in the KMI will occur naturally through mutually trusted authorities. There will be a transition period during which legacy equipments which do not support key recovery can be used to communicate with users in emerging full featured KMIs. Government, industry, and users will need to address the legitimate needs of those currently using non-key recovery products to communicate with users of the full- featured KMI in a manner that protects legitimate government and public safety concerns. This will provide a stable transition path. Products that operate with an escrowed KMI need to be developed with industry taking the lead. Industry can continue to lead in establishing standards for public key certificates, encryption algorithms, protocols, data recovery, and security servcies. Certificate authorities will operate within performance standards set by law. Agreements between governments will serve as the basisfor international cross certification. Self-escrow will be permitted under specific circumstances.(1) Export controls on Key Escrow products will be relaxed progressively as the infrastructure matures. -------- (1) The escrow agency must meet performance requirements for law enforcement access. II. Key Management Infrastructure In a key management infrastructure (KMI) based on publickey cryptography, each user has one or more pairs of publicand private keys. The public and private keys differ in a sucha way that it is computationally infeasible to determine theprivate key from the public key. This allows the public key tobe revealed without endangering the security of the privatekey. Users can communicate securely without having to share a"secret"; they only need to know each other's public key andthat each public key is certified by a trusted authority.Without assurance on the "binding" of a user to a specificpublic key, these keys have little or no value. Public key cryptography supports security services suchas authentication, confidentiality, data integrity andnonrepudiation. Access to a user's encrypted data for whichthe key is lost is a security related service referred to asdata recovery. Providing a secure and trusted means of storingprivate keys within the Key Management Infrastructure is onemeans of providing data recovery. This capability naturallysupports law enforcement access, under legal warrants. Thus,the user desire for data recovery and law enforcement'spotential need for access can be accommodated in a singlelocale, so long as the user trusts the key storage and lawenforcement has confidentiality of access.(2) ---------- (2) For a survey of escrow mechanisms see Dorothy Denning's article in the March 1996 Journal of Communications of the ACM. More in depth articles on solutions to escrow can be found in Building in Big Brother a collection of papers edited by Professor Lance Hoffman that contains both technical and political responses to Clipper/Capstone. [Diagram]                Escrow          -->  Authority  (private key database)          |         |          |         |          |         | public keys          |         |                        Escrow andprivate   |         |                        Certificatekey       |    Certificate                   Authorities(either   |    Authority                     can be combinedway)      |         |                        into one entity          |         |          |         | public key certificate          |         | (binds IDs and keys)          |         |          |         |          -->  User A (private keys and certificates) The simplest model for a KMI meets government accessrequirements by relying on the certificate authorities (CAs).However, the hierarchy could be structured to include aseparate Escrow Authority (EA) to provide law enforcementaccess. Provision for split keys to enhance personal privacyand security can be incorporated into the KMI. Either of thesemechanisms lessens the burden of key escrow on users and onthe producers of security products. To participate in the network a user needs a public keycertificate signed by a CA which "binds" the user's identityto their public key. One condition of obtaining a certificateis that sufficient information (e.g., private keys or otherinformation as appropriate) has been escrowed with a certifiedescrow authority to allow access to a user's data orcommunications.(3) (As noted before, this might be the CA oran independent escrow authority). The certificate creationprocess is pictured above. For users to have confidence in the KMI, CAs must meetminimum standards for security, performance, and liability. APolicy Approving Authority (PAA) certifies CAs for operation.The PAA sets rules and responsibilities for ensuring theintegrity of the CAs. The PAA is also responsible for settingCA performance criteria to meet law enforcement needs. If law enforcement has obtained legal authority to accessa user's encrypted data or communications, it would certifythat authorization to the escrow authority. The escrowauthority will then relinquish information sufficient toaccess the user's communication. ---------- (3) This applies only to keys used for confidentiality purposes and not keys used for signing purposes. III. Some Issues Difficult issues include i) how to refine the applicationof export controls, ii) whether and to what extent to permitself-escrow, iii) whether legislation is required and, if so,what it should accomplish, and iv) the certainty and extentthat government-to-government agreements can be established toensure timely law enforcement access to keys/information heldby a foreign country. This section of the White paper brieflyexplores each. Export Controls The most contentious issue surrounding encryption isexport control policy. Encryption exports are controlled toall destinations in the interest of U.S. national security/foreign policy under the Arms Export Control Act. These exportcontrols are often criticized as an impediment to the fieldingof interoperable security across the GII and thecompetitiveness of U.S. industry. The government is mindful ofthese criticisms and has initiated a number of reforms to easethe impact export controls have on manufacturers and users ofencryption. The task, then, is to find a method of applyingexport controls that meets the interest of national security,public safety, privacy, and competitiveness. Freedom to choose any mutually trusted certificateauthority may accommodate the above interests.(4) In addition,allowing ready export of products of any bit length to marketswhere the key management infrastructure, which complies withstatuatory constraints, is in place to permit governmentaccess to keys, would provide both a level market for U.S.manufacturers and higher quality security products for users.Products that meet defined performance requirements and whichwill not operate until the key is escrowed with an appropriatecertificate authority will address commercial, public safetyand national security needs. Some law enforcement and nationalsecurity concerns would be protected since government agencieswould be able to obtain escrowed keys pursuant to government-to-government agreements. ---------- (4) A mutually trusted authority is an escrow agent trusted by users to store keys and trusted by law enforcement to provide access upon certification of lawful authority. Transition We are working toward a policy that permits licensing ofkey recovery encryption systems regardless of algorithm, bitlength, or whether implemented in hardware or software, onceneeded infrastructure and government-to-government agreementsare in place. In the interim we recognize that the policy mustmake it worthwhile for manufacturers and users to invest inescrowed KMI. With these objectives in mind, and consistentwith applicable statutes, the interim policy will consider: Prior to formal government-to-government agreements: Permitting export of products that use an escrowed KMI to approved markets, e.g., Europe or Australia, consistent with the policies of the destination country. Prior to multi-national Public Key Infrastructure with KeyRecovery: Reviewing, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to export products which require the use of an escrowed KMI to any destination with which the U.S. has a government-to- government key escrow agreement. Continuing and expanding the administration's previously announced key escrow initiative by permitting the export of 64 bit S/W or 80 bit H/W key escrow products that meet defined performance requirements, after one-time review, to any destination if keys will be escrowed in the U.S., or in foreign countries with which the U.S. has a government-to-government key escrow agreement. In any condition: Permitting the export of other products on a case-by-case determination that such exports are consistent with US interests. The proposals for an interim export control policy arefounded on the assumption that the products will require theuse of an escrowed KMI in a country with which the U.S. has agovernment-to-government agreement. Note that the contemplatedexports are to civil end-users; exports to military end-userswill require more extensive product review. The existingpolicies applicable to unescrowed products provide substantialflexibility and will continue as currently defined throughoutthe transition period (see Appendix II). Additional requestsfor near-term relief will be considered on a case-by-casebasis consistent with existing practice. The interim policy also reflects a judgment that overseasescrow of key will generally be permissible with suitablegovernment-to-government arrangements. There is a concern thatU.S. products with keys escrowed in the U.S. will not besalable overseas. Hence, it may be possible to permitoverseas escrow in Europe, even before government-to-government arraignments are completed. This exception ispossible since the European countries are already moving toimplement key escrow systems and we can reasonably expect toenter into law enforcement agreements in the near term. TheOECD's goal of negotiating multilateral cryptographyguidelines by 31 December 1996 is further evidence of Europeanintent and momentum in infrastructure development. The interim policy reflects a differentiation betweenhardware and software products, i.e., hardware products withgreater bit lengths are treated more favorably under thispolicy. Hardware implementations of products permit moreconfident binding between encryption and the key management,limiting the risk that the encryption can be easily strippedfrom the key management and used independently of keyrecovery. Software does not provide similar protection. Thissaid, the interim policy to permit export of 64 bit softwarekey recovery products would reflect a significant increaseover the bit length restrictions applicable to non-keyrecovery products. Self-Escrow Self-escrow will be a principal concern of many largecorporations that want to provide corporate data recovery,protect against loss of proprietary data from use of anoutside escrow agent, and simply for reasons of efficiency andcost. Hence, self-escrow must be considered as an acceptableoption. Escrow requires less architecture if the CA can be theescrow authority. However, in those cases in which anindividual or corporation serves as its own certificateauthority, government organizations could be compelled torequest escrowed key from the subject of an investigation. Theinvestigation could be compromised under such circumstances.While this risk could be avoided by adding independent escrowauthorities as another layer in the PKI, such a solution wouldbe costly and inefficient. A solution is a national policy which allows CAs for anorganization to serve as escrow authorities if they can meetnecessary performance requirements. These requirements shouldbe determined by government in consultation with industry andshould address timeliness, security, confidentiality ofrequests for, or release of, keys, and independence of theescrow authority from the rest of the organization. To thisend, the government should seek legislation that would shieldorganization certificate authorities from internal pressuresin the course of law enforcement investigations. Legislation There is some consensus that the ultimate legislativepackage should include provisions to criminalize theunauthorized disclosure/use of escrowed key, provisions toauthorize civil actions by victims against those responsiblefor the unauthorized disclosure/use of escrowed key,provisions specifying the circumstances in which escrowed keymay be requested and released (e.g., death of a family memberor employee), and establishing liability protection forcertificate authorities who exercises due prudence in thefulfillment of their performance obligations. Those who endorse a larger government role would seeklegislation that would, for example, establish the governmentas a major participant in the PAA, which would be responsibleto establish policies and guidelines governing certificateissuance. In this case, the government would be authorized toassure establishment of standards for the PKI that adequatelyprovide for systems security and law enforcement access.Inasmuch as the integrity and reliability of the whole rangeof network centered activities, including electronic commerce,will depend on the integrity and reliability of the keymanagement certificate process, there is good reason forgovernment to play a substantial role. The enabling legislation envisioned here should reflectthe stated needs of industry and users. To that end,government must work closely with industry and other affectedparties to develop such legislation. Government to Government Agreements There is an expressed need by all governments to haveaccess to information affecting their own security or publicsafety. Inevitably there will be situations in which the U.S.will want access to keys in a foreign country that concerncriminal activities in violation of U.S. laws and vice versa.The security and other technical protocols that will serve asthe framework of the GII should ensure key recovery ispossible in either circumstance. The U.S. government shouldseek to frame and execute law enforcement agreements that: will allow for timely access when authorized minimally impact security products operate within guidelines established for key recovery methods including trusted third parties and self-escrow standards used in the U.S. It would be recognized that no agreement can guaranteeaccess to keys/information held in a foreign country, butestablished agreements might serve as a framework to requestlawful access to keys/information. Such arrangements will bebased on the philosophy that authorized government access mustbe preserved consistent with the legally recognized privacyinterests of the citizens of each country. IV. Actions Several issues discussed in this paper raise substantialpolicy questions that will not be easily resolved. Thegovernment, however, has an interest in seeing good securityproducts populate the NII and GII as soon as possible. To demonstrate resolve and good faith, the United StatesGovernment should immediately: 1. Collaborate with industry and existing standards groups, to develop Key Management Infrastructure and attendant products performance requirements (with a working draft completed within 6 months); 2. Collaborate with industry on a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) within government that specifies a suite of algorithms and protocols for encryption, key exchange, and digital signature functions sufficient to protect government information. The resulting FIPS should provide for key recovery operations and should be mandatory for government use. 3. Establish a security management infrastructure for government use which complies with the standards developed jointly by industry and government. This is the first step in providing a market for industry products which support the new FIPS. 4. Determine an appropriate government agency to work with industry in specifying security requirements for products used in network security applications for protecting highly sensitive information. 5. Collaborate with industry to formulate legislation to establish viable key management infrastructure. Such legislation would, inter alia, set policies for assuring the integrity of escrowed key, establish an appropriate government role in this PAA, and address civil liability issues. 6. Negotiate with other governments arrangements for access to escrowed keys consistent with national sovereignty, national security, and public safety. As trusted partners, industry and government can shareexpertise and tackle intractable problems such as the insecureoperating system. In times past, the cryptographic algorithmwas the core of the solution: now it is the easy part. Thedebate over algorithms and bit lengths should end: it is timefor industry and governments to work together to secure theGII in such a way that does not put the world at risk. Appendix I: One View of a KMI The discussion given here is intended to provide adescription of how a KMI might be designed and operatedconsistent with the tenets of the White Paper. Thisdescription is not intended to preclude consideration ofother, equally suitable, implementations. Introduction to KMI Based Escrow In a KMI based on public key cryptography, each user hasone or more pairs of public and private keys. The public andprivate keys differ in such a way that it is computationallyinfeasible to determine the private key from the public key.This allows the public key to be revealed without endangeringthe security of the private key. Users can communicatesecurely without having to share a "secret", they only need toknow each other's public key. In practice, users may havemultiple public/private key pairs. The key pairs may be used in applications such as keyexchanges and digital signatures. To make use of suchapplications, a user's public keys must be available tointended recipients in a manner that the recipient canconfidently associate the user with his/her public key.Without assurances on the "binding" of user identities to aspecific public key, these keys have little or no value. Thus, in the context of public key cryptography, thestrength of cryptographic mechanisms relates to protecting theconfidentiality of the private keys and the integrity of thepublic keys. Ultimately, the viability of public keycryptographic applications is dependent on the evolution of akey management infrastructure. KMI and Certificates The KMI supports the integrity of public keys through thegeneration and distribution of public key certificates. Therole of a certificate is to cryptographically bind a specificuser identity with a public key and other security relatedinformation. A trusted system entity, generally called aCertificate Authority (CA), obtains information from anindividual sufficient to verify the individual is who he sayshe is. The CA then generates and digitally signs a certificatespecific to that individual using the CA's private signaturekey. Any system user can then validate the contents of thatcertificate by verifying the CA's digital signature (via theCA's public signature key). Certificate contents must be bound together by amechanism which can be authenticated. The certificate formatcommonly used is based on the structure defined by the CCITTX.509 Recommendation. This has worldwide support in industryand governments. The concept of a CA can be easily extended to apply to alarge system of users where a single CA is not feasible.Providing interoperability within a system containing multipleCAs leads to a hierarchical structure. At the very top of thehierarchy is a Root entity which is often referred to as aPolicy Approving Authority (PAA). The PAA represents thesingle node in the hierarchy that all system users trust. ThePAA creates the overall guidelines and policies for theoperation of the KMI. The PAA exists to ensure the securityand integrity of each and every entity within the hierarchy.Security and integrity are enforced by PAA certifying thepublic keys of subordinate CAs. Each of these subordinate CAsmay also certify the public keys of other CAs or users. Asample hierarchy is pictured below. The PAA public signaturekey is possessed by all those in the hierarchy. [Hierarchical Diagram]                           PAA                           |                  CA1     CA2    CA3                   |       |      |               CA4    CA5     CA6     CA7                |      |       |       |     (------------------ Users ----------------) Any two users within a defined hierarchy can validateeach other's public key certificates through a commoncertification path. A certification path is an orderedsequence of certificates between the entity to be validatedand the trusted point in the hierarchy, i.e., PAA. Thisdefines a path of trust. Validation of any system certificaterequires that each certificate in the certification path bechecked by verifying the digital signature over eachcertificate. To maintain trust in the path, the entities making upcertificate authorities must follow prescribed rules foridentifying users, issuing certificates, and protecting keys.Adherence to these regulations can be enforced by a PAA or asa condition of cross certification between two CertificateAuthorities. After a CA generates a certificate, it is transferred tothe user along with the certificates in the user'scertification path. Distribution of certificates among systementities can be accomplished by sending them via e-mail(quickly becomes unwieldy) or through the use of a DirectorySystem. Other users can then request and retrieve certificatesdirectly from a Directory Server. The hierarchical structure is designed to supportmultiple communities of users who may need to communicate witheach other. It is also possible that some communities of usersin the system could remain autnomous and yet still be able tocommunicate with users outside their immediate community ofinterest. The PAA provides the means for such inter-communitycommunication by functioning as the single mutually trustedauthority for the entire hierarchy. Cross Certification There could exist one or more PAAs within the U.S. andnon-U.S. KMIs. To permit communication between users ofdifferent PAA domains, a common certification path must exist.Cross certification will be based on the existence of acceptedpolicies and standard certification criteria. PAAs from eachKMI could then cross certify each other. This is accomplishedby each PAA countersigning the registered public keycertificates of the other. This cross certifying ofcertificates provides a valid certification path for all usersin the respective KMIs. [Diagram]                              CC              U.S. PAA<-------------->Non-U.S. PAA          |    |   |   \                 |     |         CA1   |   |     \     CC        |     |               |   |       \----------->CAa   CAb              CA2  |                   |                  CA3 Cross Certification Options Between Distinct KMIs This scenario permits specific entities under one PAA tohave a verifiable certification path for communications withentities serviced by another PAA. It is important to note,however, that the integrity of this cross certification systemis only assured by limiting cross certification to bilateralnad direct connection between the two PAAs involved. One PAAshould not rely on the representation of another that a thirdPAA has been authenticated. Key Recovery Performance Criteria Key recovery provides for backup storage of a user'sprivate keys. This backup capability helps ensure theavailability of a user's data even after it has beenencrypted. It also provides for an effective means for lawenforcement access. Key recovery requirements would be viewedfrom the perspective of the individual, the corporation, orgovernments that require access. Most of the criteria to bediscussed have a dimension for key recovery on an individualbasis as well as from a corporate or government perspective.The criteria can be grouped into three categories. 1. Key Integrity: Confidentiality - Key recovery storage and release mechanisms must preclude simple exploitation. Availability - Key recovery data must be available when subject to authorized release. 2. Key Accessibility: Responsiveness - Timely access to key recovery information requires 24 hour responsiveness and real time accessibility requires a two hour response window to authorized requests. Confidentiality - Confidentiality must be maintained on all requests for release of key recovery information. Proof of Approval - Trustworthy on-line or off-line mechanisms must exist to support identification and authorized release of key recovery information. 3. Key Recovery Use: Subject Message Recovery - All information related to the subject of the recovery request must be accessible through the release of key recovery information pertaining only to that subject. Release Window - The start and end dates of authorized key recovery periods must be enforced. Key Recovery Using KMI[Diagram]                Escrow          -->  Authority  (private key database)          |         |          |         |          |         | public keys          |         |                        Escrow andprivate   |         |                        Certificatekey       |    Certificate                   Authorities(either   |    Authority                     can be combinedway)      |         |                        into one entity          |         |          |         | public key certificate          |         | (binds IDs and keys)          |         |          |         |          -->  User A (private keys and certificates) Key recovery fits well within a public key KMI.Interleaving key recovery within the KMI provides for aconcentration of trust that stands to benefit the individualsfrom a confidentiality of private key aspect and facilitatesgovernment access by limiting the number of access points. Themost simple model is to rely on the existing CAs within theKMI to meet government access requirements. If necessary,however, the hierarchy can be structured to include an EscrowAuthority (EA) as a separate trusted entity. EA hierarchy is intrinsically shallow when compared withthe depth of the CA hierarchy. The structure is more likenedto a peer group of EAs that all fall under the jurisdiction ofthe KMIs PAA which creates guidelines and policies for EAoperation. To become a system endorsed EA entity, an EA mustbe certified by the PAA. Certification encompassessatisfactory implementation of the standards and policies putforth by the PAA. The PAA provides the standardization for theescrow functions to occur across multiple EA entities with anequivalent degree of trust. It is important to stress thatsome or all of the elements of the escrow infrastructure maybe the same as those in the certificate infrastructure. TheKMI supports both. As with the certification of subordinate CAs, therecognition of a certified status for a particular EA isembodied by the PAAs digital signature on the public keycertificate of the EA (thus attesting to the validity of theservice they provide). This allows a particular EA to have asystem-wide recognized signature, one that is traceable backto a common trusted entity, the PAA. Two examples follow that show how the EA and CA entitieswork in tandem to provide both a certificate and data recoveryservice for users and law enforcement: 1. Certificate and Recovery Registration. In this example we have a single Escrow Authority distinct from the Certificate Authority. In reality, the EA may be the same entity as the CA or the EA may be one of a set of users certified by the government as an EA. The simple protocol described below follows closely the key escrow proposal made in 1993 by Silvio Micali of MIT. User A wishes to register, in the form of a public key certificate, a public key exchange key with his local certified KMI entity. User A does the following: Identifies himself and securely distributes the public and private components of the key pair he wishes to have registered to a certified Escrow Authority (EA). This may be done electronically. Alternately, the EA could generate these keys for User A. Uniquely identifies himself to the CA. This must be done physically unless User A already possesses a valid signature key. Distributes the public component of the key pair he wishes to have certified to the CA. The EA does the following: Protectively stores the private component. Notifies the CA that a valid key pair has been "escrowed" for user A. (This notification can take the form of a signed message from the EA that contains the public key of User A.) The CA does the following: Verifies the identity of User A. Verifies the signature on the message received from the EA. This ensures that only properly escrowed keys are entered into the system. Generates a public key certificate that contains (at least) the public key exchange key acknowledged by the EA, an identifier representing User A, an identifier for EA, and validity period for certificate management. Digitally signs the certificate using the CA private signature key. Distributes the certificate to User A (and potentially to a Directory Service). User A then verifies the CA signature on the received certificate as well as the information it contains. To more fully reflect the Key Integrity Criteria, the EAentity could in fact be a set of EAs that work in conjunctionwith a particular CA. Providing multiple EAs allows forincreased flexibility with respect to the generation, storage,and recovery of key information. Not only would users haveincreased flexibility of choice in selecting a certified EA,but they essentially have a voice in who is entrusted withprotecting their keys. Specifically, the EA entity could be aset of EAs, each of which only possesses a portion (key split)for User A's private key component. This provides a recoverymechanism for User A that more directly protects his privatekey component since recovery of the key by other thanauthorized requests would require collusion on the part of allEAs, compromise of all EA storage mechanisms, or compromise ofall of the distribution paths used during recovery from eachEA to User A) 2. User Key Recovery: An Archiving Example In this example User A stores (archives) his data in encrypted form using a locally generated key. He must have alternate access to that encrypted data. Consider the following: User A generates a private key (session, archive, message, etc.) User A encrypts his information with this archivekey. User A encrypts the archive key with his public keyexchange key (of which the private component isescrowed). The result of this encryption is stored, along with public escrow key, in the header portion of theencrypted file. Upon loss of his key exchange key, decryption ofthe information is accomplished by requestingrelease of the private key exchange key from theEA. User A identifies himself to the EA(s) holding hisprivate key and requests its release. The EA(s) does the following: Positively identifies the requestor. Locates and securely transmits the private keycomponent to User A. 3. Law Enforcement Key Recovery: An e-mail Example In this example the sender of a message, generates asession key, encrypts the message with the session keyand encrypts the session key he uses to protect hiscommunications with the recipient's public key exchangekey. This encrypted session key is stored in the headerinformation of the encrypted message for recipient andgovernment recovery purposes. The key recovery processproceeds in the following manner: Escrowed data to or from the subject of a lawfulinvestigation is intercepted. The subject's public key certificate is obtainedfrom the data or a Directory Service. The Escrow Authority ID is extracted from thecertificate. This allows law enforcement to locatethe private key components. Legal authorization is obtained to receive theappropriate escrowed private key(s) components. Legal authorization is presented to appropriateEA(s). This may involve working through foreigngovernments. EA(s) verifies authenticity of request. EA(s) securely transmits the private keycomponent(s) to law enforcement (this could beaccomplished physically or electronically.) Law enforcement forms the private key from itsprivate key component(s) and decrypts to recoverthe session key and the message. Law enforcement will destroy keys at the end of theauthorized period of use. Access can be also be time boundeddirectly by users by repeating the registration process. Appendix II: Current Encryption Export Policies This appendix has been prepared to state clearly theexisting encryption export control policies and procedures. While the government recognizes that further progress isneeded in license processing, changes instituted to date haveresulted in a reduction of average license turnaround time of39 days in 1993 to an average of 13 days in 1995. Further,over 99% of export licenses for proposed cryptographicproducts are approved each year. Authorities The export of cryptographic products is regulated by theDepartment of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act(AECA) and its implementing International Traffic In ArmsRegulations (ITAR), and by the Department of Commerce pursuantto the Export Administration Act (EAA) and its implementingExport Administration Regulations (EAR). No license is required for the import of cryptographichardware or software. There are no federal laws regulating theuse of cryptographic products within the United States. Alicense is required for the export of cryptographic productsto all destinations except Canada. Applications are reviewedby the Department of Defense (NSA) for national securityimplications and by State for foreign policy concerns. Theexport licensing policy is consistent with U.S. nationalsecurity and foreign policy. The Department of Commerce controls the export ofrudimentary cryptographic products containing cryptographicfunctions generally limited to purposes such as dataauthentication, password protection, and access control.Products which are determined to be covered by the CommerceControl List (CCL), with certain foreign policy exceptions,may be exported under a General License. Procedures Autolist - For products reviewed and approved by NSA forexport to approved classes of end users and end uses.Permits Department of State to process licenseapplications for such products without further review byNSA. Distribution Arrangements - Single license vehicle forexport of approved products to classes of end users incountries or regions. Avoids need for licenses on anexport-by-export basis. Distribution Agreements - Permits single license forexport of approved products to identified distributors.Again, avoids export-by-export licensing. Personal Use Exemption - Products exported for thepersonal use of the exporter are excepted from pre-exportlicense requirements. Policies Products designed to use cryptography for accesscontrol/authentication purposes are export controlled asdual use commodities pursuant to the ExportAdministration Act. Product manufacturers determine if their products areaccess control/authentication devices. Generally, access control/authentication products areexportable under general license procedures. Mass-market software products verified as implementingRC2/RC4 encryption algorithms, with 40-bit key spacelimitations, are designated dual use items, to becontrolled under the Export Administration Act, after aone-time review completed within 7 working days ofsubmission. Mass-market software implementing other encryptionalgorithms and key space lengths for confidentiality arereviewed on a case-by-case basis for designation as dualuse items and control under the Export AdministrationAct. By regulation, reviews must be completed within 15days of submission. Generally, licenses are approved for export of productsto be used in protecting U.S. proprietary information(i.e., intellectual property). U.S. companies and their subsidiaries are allowed toexport products with strong encryption for their internaluse. Confidentiality encryption products that incorporate theData Encryption Standard (DES) are routinely approved forexport to: Financial institutions and financial applications Protecting financial information in Electroniccommerce applications Confidentiality encryption products that incorporate theData Encryption Standard (DES) are favorably consideredfor export to: Applications involving protection of personalmedical data Parking and toll systems; Debit applications; Othertransaction-based systems in which encryption isconfigured to perform identified specifictransactions.

This isprobably an accurate reading of the Endangered Species Act as written, but itpoints to a deep logical fault in environmental orthodoxy. If local variationsin climate and diet convert creatures to different species, a black man wholives in Seattle, gets rained on and eats salmon would be a different speciesfrom a white man who lives in stifling humidity in Louisiana and dines ongumbo. By this theory the human race contains hundreds of species. The sort ofpeople likely to be environmentalists maintain that when it comes to genushomo, all individuals of all origins are exactly the same in genetic heritage.Yet when it comes to animals, the tiniest distinction renders apparentlyidentical living things irrevocably separate species. The typical northern andCalifornia spotted owls look and act more alike than the typical blackAmerican and white African. But according to politically correct dogma,different people are identical while similar birds are drastically different.WT03-B24-70IA053-000895-B044-83http://isse.gmu.edu:80/students/pfarrell/geek/e.html 129.174.40.15 19970123195039 text/html 567HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Thu, 23 Jan 1997 19:49:22 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5.2Last-modified: Thu, 27 Jul 1995 04:27:09 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 385 Pat's 'e' geek code This is obvious, my homepage says I'm working on my PhD, and at GMU, they essentially make you get a MS before you get into the PhD program.

This document describes a method by which certificates which communicate Diffie-Hellman public values and parameters may be encoded and securely named.

Currently, however, a common public key certificate infrastructure does not exist which is interoperable with other systems and ubiquitous. In light of this, we describe a protocol which may be used to exchange or retrieve certificates (essentially signed public keys) with or from another entity. The protocol may be used to request certificates from a directory/name server or from the entity who owns the certificate.

It is very difficult to make a vigorous, plausible, and job-risking defense of an estimate that is derived by no quantitative method, supported by little data, and certified chieflyby the hunches of managers." Regenerative Schedule Disaster The Mythical Man-month, Frederick Brooks, 1975, Addison Wesley, page 21 on metrics "When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind. It may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science." Popular Lectures and Addresses, Lord (William Thompson) Kelvin. on prototypes "The management question, therefore, is not whether to build a pilot system and throw it away. You willdo that. The only question is whether to plan in advance to build a throwaway, or to promise to deliver the throwaway to customers. Seen this way,the answer is much clearer. Delivering that throwaway to customers buys time, but it does so only at the cost of agony for the user, distracton forthe builders while they do the redesign,and a bad reputation for the product that the best redesign willfind hard to live down. Hence plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow." Plan to Throw One Away The Mythical Man-month, Frederick Brooks, 1975, Addison Wesley, page 116 on employement "That is a terible thing to do on your last day at work". AMS Vice President Douglas Ingling, to an employee who justdeleted a customer's entire database. on whether software engineering is an oxymoron "If that is what you call software engineering, it is a libelous insult to allprofessional engineers." Richard J. Farrell, Professional Engineer, after attending aclass in Software Engineering at GMU. on organizations "We trained hard - but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we were reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing, and what a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while actually producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization."

Senate Subcommittee on Technology and the Law Hearing on the Administration's Key Escrow Encryption Standard Written Questions for Vice Admiral McConnell, NSA *Questions for Senator Pressler: Q: Admiral, as you are aware, critics of the Administration'sproposal argue that as a practical matter, no criminal, foreignspy, or terrorist of any sophisticated would be foolish enough touse an encryption device designed by the NSA and approved by theFBI. How do you respond? Why do[n't you] think the people whosetelecommunications the NSA and the FBI want most to decode will bethe very people most unlikely to use this technology? Answer: From what we know today, the overriding requirement that spies, terrorist, and criminals have is for readily available and easy to use equipment that interoperates. Key escrow encryption isnot meant to be a tool to catch criminals. It will make excellentencryption available to legitimate businesses and private citizenswithout allowing criminals to use the telecommunications system to plan and commit crimes with impunity. We believe it would beirresponsible for government to make excellent encryption broadly available knowing that its use by criminals would make itimpossible for law enforcement agencies to conduct lawful wiretaps against them. The Department of Justice credits information gleaned throughwiretaps as leading to more than 20,000 felony convictions sincethe early 1980s. This would not have been possible if thecriminals had been using encryption systems the FBI could notbreak. Without government action, however, this fortunate situationwill change. At present most people, and most criminals, don't useencryption. However, there is an increasing public awareness ofthe value of encryption for protecting private personal andbusiness communications. Increasing demand for encryption by thepublic will likely lead to the widespread use of some form ofstandardized encryption on the public telecommunications network. This development would have great benefits for the country.Legitimate businesses an private individuals could use thetelecommunications system secure in the knowledge that theirprivate information such as business records and credit cardnumbers could not be intercepted by third parties. But there is a down side. Criminals, terrorists, and otherscould also use the system to plan crimes, launder money, and thelike, completely secure in the knowledge that law enforcementagencies could not listen to those communications. Just aslegitimate businesses operate much more efficiently and effectivelyusing the telecommunications system than they could without it, sowill criminal enterprises be able to operate more efficiently andeffectively if they no longer have to avoid using thetelecommunications system. The United States is faced with a choice. We can sit back andwatch as the emerging national information infrastructure becomesa valuable tool for criminals and terrorists to use to plan andcarry out their activities with complete security, or we can takesteps to maintain the current ability of government to conductlawful wiretaps so that prudent criminals will have to find otherless efficient ways to operate and foolish ones may be caught. Keyescrow encryption is the later option. Q: Would widespread use of the Skipjack algorithm harm U.S.exports? Do you think it is unlikely foreign businesses willpurchase American encryption technology if the U.S. Governmentholds a set of the decoding keys? Answer: I do not believe that widespread use of key escrowencryption in the United States will harm U.S. exports. If it has any effect at all, it could increase exports somewhat. Key escrow encryption products provide another option for foreign purchasers that they have not had in the past; to the extent that foreigners doe purchase key escrow encryption products, it will mean anincrease in exports. Meanwhile, U.S. exporters are free tocontinue to sell the products they currently sell in foreignmarkets and to seek license approvals for new products. It is difficult to predict the foreign market for U.S. keyescrow encryption technology. Businesses that fear U.S. Governmentinterception of their communications presumably would avoidproducts for which the U.S. Government hold keys. However, thereare a number of reasons why foreign businesses might purchase them.One major reason would be to communicate securely with U.S.businesses that use them. In addition, the superior level ofsecurity provided by key escrow products (against all but lawfulU.S. Government access) may make them attractive to foreignbusiness that do not view U.S Government access as a major concern.While some prospective users abroad may steer clear of key escrowproducts because the United States will retain access, there may bemany who believe they are unlikely to be targeted by U.S.intelligence in any case or for whom the superior security offeredby key escrow encryption products against threats of greaterconcern may make key escrow products an attractive option. Forexample, a distributor of pay-TV programming may depend onencryption to ensure that only those viewers who pay for theservice can decrypt the TV signal. Such a distributor probablywould not be concerned about the threat of access by the UnitedStates Government, and might favor suitable key escrow encryptionproducts over competing products that use weaker encryptionalgorithms. Q: You were present when the previous panelist, Stephen Walker,described how present U.S. laws prohibit his company from exportingencryption products. As I understand it, Senator Murray's billS.1846, attempts to relax these export controls somewhat. Please give us your views on this legislation. Answer: I support the Administration's position, as announcedby the White House on February 4, that current export controls mustremain in place and that regulatory changes should be implementedto speed exports and reduce the licensing burden on exporters. Thebill you reference appears to be inconsistent with theAdministration position. I would be happy to provide you furtherinformation on the Administration's reasons for maintaining thecurrent export controls in an appropriate setting. *Questions from Senator Murray: Q: In my office in the Hart building this February, I downloadedfrom the Internet an Austrian program that uses DES encryption.This was on a laptop computer, using a modem over a phone line.The Software Publishers' Association says there are at least 120DES or comparable programs world wide. However, U.S. exportcontrol laws prohibit American exporters from selling comparableDES programs abroad. With at least 20 million people hooked up to theInternet, how do U.S. export controls actually prevent criminals,terrorists, or whoever from obtaining DES encryption software? Answer: Serious users of encryption do not entrust theirsecurity to software distributed via networks or bulletin boards.There is simply too much risk that viruses, Trojan Horses,programming errors, and other security flaws may exist in suchsoftware which could not be detected by the user. Serious users ofencryption, those who depend on encryption to protect valuable dataand cannot afford to take such chances, instead turn to othersources in which they can have greater confidence. Such serioususers include not only entitles which may threaten U.S. nationalsecurity interests, but also businesses and other major consumersof encryption products. Encryption software distribution viaInternet, bulletin board, or modem does not undermine theeffectiveness of encryption export controls. [Primary written questions for Admiral McConnell] 1. The Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1994 hasauthorized $800,000 to be spent by the National Research Council ofthe National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of federalencryption policy. Can we wait to implement the key escrowencryption program until we have the benefit of the NRC's study?Do you think this study is necessary? Should this study beexpedited? Answer: We do not believe that we can wait until after theNRC study is completed in 1996 to begin implementation of the keyescrow initiative. The information technology industry is dynamicand fast-moving, and to wait another two years or more would, webelieve, jeopardize the success of the initiative. Industry demandfor encryption products is growing, and the technology is availablenow to meet that demand with encryption products that provide anoutstanding level of security to the user conduct lawful wiretaps.To wait for the completion of the NRC study to other encryptionproducts which would defeat lawful wiretaps. We believe that sucha delay would not be in the best interest of the American people. Neither do we believe that the study should be expedited. Forour part, we will carefully consider the conclusions of the NRCstudy. We expect that it will give very careful consideration tothe issues, and we would not want the pressure of an unnecessarilyshort deadline to limit the study group's ability to produce thebest report possible. 2. The Administration has said that it is continuing to restrictexport of the most sophisticated encryption devices, in part,"because of the concerns of our allies who fear that strongencryption technology would inhibit their law enforcementcapabilities." Do we really need to help our allies by prohibitingthe export of strong American encryption products, since those samecountries can simply control the encryption bought within theirborders? Answer: Exports of encryption products are subject to reviewprimarily to protect U.S. national interests, including nationalsecurity, law enforcement, foreign policy, and other importantinterests. The law enforcement concerns of our allies are aconsideration, especially as the ability of our allies to combatterrorism, drug trafficking, and other international lawenforcement problems can have direct benefits to the United States.However, foreign law enforcement concerns do not drive our exportcontrol policy. We would continue to review encryption exports toprotect U.S. national interests even if foreign law enforcementconcerns disappeared. 3. Do you know whether foreign governments would be interested inimporting key escrow encryption products to which they hold thedecoding keys? Answer: Several foreign governments have expressed interestin key escrow encryption technology due to their own lawenforcement concerns. There have been some preliminarydiscussions, but issues such as who would hold the escrowed keysand the circumstances of government access to escrowed keys must befully vetted. 4. The Government wants the key escrow encryption standard tobecome the de facto industry standard in the United States. Wouldthe Government abandon the Clipper Chip program if it is shown tobe unsuccessful beyond government use? Answer: We do not expect the program to be unsuccessfulbeyond government. We have developed a sound security product that we expect will find many uses in government information systems and further believe that government use will bring with it a commercial market, particularly in the defense sector. We have developed a sound security product that we expect will find many uses ingovernment information systems regardless of its success incommercial markets. 5. Openly available devices, such as Intel-compatiblemicroprocessors, have seen dramatic gains, but only becauseeveryone was free to try to build a better version. Given therestrictions on who can build devices with the classified skipjackalgorithm, how will key escrow chips keep up with advances insemiconductor speed, power, capacity and integration? Answer: Despite the requirements that a firm must meet toproduce key escrow encryption chips, we expect that there will bea number of manufacturers competing against each other to producethe best product, and that such competition will drive them to keepup with the latest technological advances. It is worth noting thatonly a few companies can produce the sophisticated microprocessorsyou reference, yet the competition in that market has driven themto achieve remarkable advances in that technology. NSA's STU-IIIsecure telephone program provides an example of a cryptographicproduct line that keeps pace with technology. The presence of a classified algorithm does not precludekeeping pace with technology. Through NSA's use of a competitive,multi-vendor approach, STU-III secure telephone products havecontinued to evolve in response to user requirements andtechnological advances despite their use of a classified encryptionalgorithm and the consequent need for security restrictions on themanufacturers. 6. How well does the Skipjack algorithm work ontelecommunications operating at very high speeds. Is NSA workingon another algorithm, called BATON, that could be used in highspeeds with a key escrow system? Will Capstone be compatible withBATON? Answer: Using currently available microelectronics technologythe SKIPJACK algorithm could not be used for encryption at veryhigh speeds. BATON is the name of an algorithm developed by NSAthat could be used at higher rates of speed. We have no plans todevelop key escrow encryption devices using BATON, however.Instead, we are considering another algorithm for use at highspeeds with a key escrow system. A high-speed key escrow device based on an algorithm otherthan SKIPJACK would not be "compatible with Capstone" in the sensethat traffic encrypted by such a device could not be decrypted byCapstone, and vice versa. However, since such a device would beused for much higher-speed applications than those for whichCapstone was designed, there would be no need for it to becompatible with Capstone in that sense. 7. Can Capstone be used to encrypt video programming? If so,have cable companies been approached by any government agency touse Capstone to scramble or encrypt cable program? Answer: Capstone could be used to encrypt any digital signal,including video programming, operating at up to about 10 millionbits per second. It could be used for encrypting individual videochannels but not for bulk encryption of many channels multiplexedtogether in a single link. NSA is not aware of any governmentagency approaching cable companies to urge the use of Capstone.Two manufacturers have asked us about the suitability of key escrowdevices for this purpose, however. 8. Encryption software is available that can be used with Clipperto encypt a message before after it has been encrypted withClipper. This "double encrypting" risks bypassing the key escrowfeature. If a sender first encrypts the message with softwareusing DES, and then transmits the message "double encrypted" withClipper, can tell you from looking at the cipher, or encryptedtext, that the underlying message was encrypted? Answer: The only way to tell that a message has been "doubleencrypted" in this way would be to decrypt the "outer layer" ofencryption, i.e. that done with Clipper. Only then would one beable to tell that the message had first been encrypted withsomething else. Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

I reported on the session I was in,saying what I posted to the list yesterday (about National Semi's product,etc.) The other breakout groups reported their problems with thecriteria, again asking that #9 be dropped, longer, keys, etc.The presentation for Group "A" was different. It was a speach.It asked that the process be stopped to let industry developmarket-driven solutions. It was greeted by applause from thevendors and privacy advocates, with no reaction from thegovernment representatives. Randy Williams of Commerce, and Dan Cook of State, described thecurrent export approval process. Lots of talk of jurisdictionsand types of liscenses. I quickly got lost in the jargon.The moderator wisecracked that the official language of the sessionwas English. You couldn't tell from some of the exchanges. They were questioned on import restrictions. Both Williams and Cooksaid that there are no import restrictions into the US. They alsopointed out that Treasury, not State or Commerce, has jurisdiction overimports. An engineer from Compaq asked a question: He said that his companybuys liscenses to software, and bundles it as "value added" totheir systems. They are interested in bundling in security features.He asked if his computers would then be subject to export restrictions.The answer was yes. He asked if he could purchase security softwareoverseas and import it. The answer was again yes. He asked ifhe could install that software on his computers, again yes. Andexport the computers, NO. They didn't even seem to think that thiswas illogical. So Commerce, State, and the rest of the government are activlyencouraging the development of competing software industries inIsrael, Germany and other counrties. I hate to think what they'ddo if they tried to hurt US industry. And interesting tidbit came up after the session. In an offlineconversation, the topic of "personal use export" came up. Areliable source said that revised regulations are being developed,and will, be available soon. I explicitly asked if this meant"PGP on a notebook computer" and was told, Yes, that will be allowed;with the usual rules that it can't be for export, you can't be attemptingto sell it, etc. Personal use, carry out and carry back. The "source" wasasked if they had read Matt Blaze's personal use disaster story.The name didn't ring a bell, but the story was well known and considereda nightmare. Penny Brummitt of NSA was to talk about Clipper's key escrow agents,but called in sick. So Jan Manning gave the presentation. (He is NSA's persondesigning the Law Enforcement decrypt box for Clipper.)He talked about Clipper's process, not as an example of what willbe required for GAK agents, but as an "existance proof" that someagents can be found. The essence was that Clipper escrow facilities arestrong, and staffed with people cleared to the "Secret" level. They alsotosed out the phrase "US Person" in regard to the corporate entity that isresponsible for the contract. Geoff Greiveldinger, of the US Department of Justice, gave a frequentlyinaudible recounting of the evils of strong encryption in the waron D, P, & T, and also corrupt mayors. He was very personable. He alsosounded like a fascist. Throughout the meeting, all sides tried tohave a civil discussion, even though we disagreed. It wasimpossible to stay civil through his drivel. Ruby Ridge and Furmanhad been unmentionable up until his speach. Mr. Greiveldinger said that acceptable escrow agents will be in the US.This caused considerable concern among vendors trying to sellin the International market. Dan Weitzner of CDT (the Center for Democracy and Technology) gave a short, rousing speach. Itwas a call to arms. He said that since NIS&T was ignoring theconsistant input from industry to stop this silly and stupid GAK, thatwe need to immediately contact our congresscritters. Ken Mendelson of TIS gave a great speach. He suggested thatthe critera for escrow agents be the same as the form to export tanksand other munitions. Then he showed the one page form used by State.He argued that legislative solutions to the escrow agent approval processwill take too long and kill the effort.Follow this link for a copy of the text of Ken's presentation F.W. Gerbracht, Jr a VP Merril Lynch, represented the Securities IndustryAssociation. He said that they are willing to work with the government,but they need long keys, strong ciphers, and international escrow agents.He used the phrase "unlimited algorithms and keyspace" as a requirement.They also need buy in from their regulators, and presented a long listof SEC, CFT, NYSE, NASDealers, and 50 state regulators, all who haveto sign off. Nanette DiTosto of Bankers Trust gave a short, to the point presentation.She said that BT has a commercial key escrow service, but that was notwhat she wanted to get accross. She said that multinational banks demandstrong encryption and non-US escrow agents. And that they wouldsettle for nothing less. Shabbir J. Safdar from VTW gave a nice presentation. VTW is Voters Telecommunications Watch. They have a mailing list, atlistproc@vtw.org. He said that escrow was doomed to failure. That thereis no middle ground. Jack Wack of TECSEC gave a pitch for his shrinkwrapped product. Hesaid it is exportable now, they've jumped through all the hoops.He also gave a great crack from his son. It went roughly like:"Dad, if you own the data before you encrypt it, how come thegovernment says you don't own it after you encrypt it?"It brought down the house. (if someone has a more accurate quote, pleaselet me have a copy). Professor Hoffman of George Washington gave a great speach. He listedthe Al Gore to Maria Cantwell letter's criteria, as a matrix. He thenfilled in the matrix with the Export GAK's criteria. It was painfullyobvious that the NIST/NSA propsal didn't come close. He recommendedthat they focus closly on the Gore criteria, and come up with anapproach that meets all the the criteria. While I planned on staying for the remainder of the meeting, a crisiscame up at my day job. I can't say I was looking forward to more,a day and a half was enough for me, and I wasn't the only person leavingearly. Attendance was down visibly Thursday relative to the first day Pat Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

THOUGHTS ON THIRD PARTY AGENT CRITERIA Delivered at the National Institute For Standard & Technology, Gaithersburg, MarylandSeptember 7, 1995 by Ken Mendelsen of TIS [Note from PFarell: this is the text from Ken's presentation.) In order to being our discussion of the 10th criteria, that is, the notion of exportability being granted only to those products whose keys are escrowed with a government "approved" escrow agent, we must first make an exhaustive review of the current requirements for domestic or international key escrow agent operation: Ken showed a blank slide and paused. Now that we've done that, let's move on. It is against this backdrop of good, solid regulatory precedent that we must decide what the government's third party agent regulations should be -- or whether there should be any at all... As we discuss the desirable characteristics of potential third party agents, it is essential that we remember that we are discussing the relationship between Domestic Third Party Agent regulations and the exportability of encryption products. While nobody is suggesting that strictly domestic activities be regulated, there is one overriding consideration for industry.... Public confidence in any key escrow system is ESSENTIAL for its success. It is not in anyone's best interest - not even industry's - for known criminals to be third party agents, or for law enforcement to be unable to do its job.... In the absence of government imposed regulations, industry has every incentive create its own rules to maintain the society's confidence in the integrity of the system.... We are entering uncharted territory here. Whenever new, dynamic and useful industries are created, people think of new and ever more creative ways to sue one another. With all of the potential liability lurking about out there, companies that provide third party agent technology are going to make every reasonable effort to ensure those entities that choose to act as third party agents are not going to expose them to unreasonable liability. These providers are going to find it necessary to compile certain basic information about the potential third party agents. --both to show they have acted reasonably, and to maintain system integrity.-- However, this need must be balanced with the commercial reality that asking too much of potential key escrow agents is commercially undesirable..... TIS thought it might be nice to require the same information from potential third party agents that the State Department requires from those who register to export Firearms, Tanks and Military Vehicles. Accordingly, we offer a possible solution.... Ken shows a one page form used by the State Department to controlexports of munitions. This slide is a sample Department of State application for registration to be a munitions exporter. It is not terribly onerous to complete. We believe it is not unreasonable for providers of third party agent technology to require this information from their prospective licensees in the ordinary course of business, and perhaps even some additional information regarding anindividual who can be contacted in the event of an emergency. Good business practice might also require a favorable credit rating and a certificate of good standing from the state of incorporation. These are things industry can do on its own -- without having to wait for a lengthy, and unreliable, legislative outcome. From our perspective, we would have no problem telling prospective third party agents that we are collecting this information for our own purposes, but that we would make it available to law enforcement upon request. If they refuse to provide the information, we would refuse to sell them the technology..... If we require industry to wait for legislation to have "approved" escrow agents, the people in charge of granting export approval for encryption products will make Maytag repairmen look like party animals. Industry can, and will, compile the information necessary to protect itself, and assist law enforcement when it is appropriate to do so. Thank you. Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

D7.   Technology / Peter H. Lewis   On The Net. Privacy for computers? Clinton sets the stage   for a debate on data encryption.   In terms of its ability to raise the nation's blood   pressure, the debate over data encryption has not yet   reached the same levels as gun control.   But last week the Clinton Administration appeared to set   the stage for an equally divisive debate over the degree to   which businesses and individuals have the right to keep   secrets when using telephones, computers and other forms of   electronic communications.   In two days of public hearings last week in Gaithersburg,   Md., home of the National Institute of Standards and   Technology, the Administration introduced its long-awaited   proposals to relax restrictions on the export of   cryptographic software.   The Administration drew a line in the virtual sands of   cyberspace, signaling that it is willing to permit   Americans to put stronger cryptographic locks on their   electronic data only if a spare key to those locks is made   available on demand to law-enforcement agencies.   There looms the conflict. Although the debate is about   export controls the "export" issue is irrelevant in today's   era of global electronic networks. Placing a common privacy   program on an Internet computer in Austin, Tex., is   effectively no different from sending a shrink-wrapped copy   of the program to Moscow.   The real issue is how much privacy the Government is   willing to allow its own citizens, and the latest word from   the Clinton Administration is that the right to electronic   privacy, like the right to bear arms, is not absolute.   Cryptography is the science of secret writing. In this   digital era, it applies not just to notes, but also to   telephone calls, money transfers, bank and credit card   records, electronic mail, faxes and other computer files.   The Clinton Administration's goal is to allow Americans to   use the strongest possible cryptographic technology, while   at the same time preserving the ability of law-enforcement   agencies to perform court-authorized wiretaps as part of   the effort to catch drug dealers, terrorists, child   pornographers and other miscreants.                In other words, it favors strong cryptography, but not too   strong.   The strength of cryptographic software is measured by the   length of the software key necessary to encode and decode   a message. The longer the key, the harder it is for an   unauthorized user to decipher the message.   In recent years, the Government has generally permitted   Americans to export cryptographic software with key lengths   up to 40 bits. Experts say that 40-bit keys are secure from   casual snooping, but will fall quickly to a determined   codebreaker.   Last week, after more than a year of intense analysis, the   Government introduced what it said was the best possible   compromise.   Under the new policy, companies can export encryption   algorithms using 64-bit keys, which are much more secure,   but only if spare keys are given to "escrow agents" who   would make them available to lawenforcement agents under   standard legal procedures, similar to legal wiretaps   authorized by a judge. Otherwise, the 40-bit limit   continues to apply.   Such a "key escrow" scheme is anathema to many privacy   advocates who fear Government abuses. The Government first   proposed a key escrow system with its so-called Clipper   Chip, a technology that failed to win acceptance even as a   voluntary standard.   The new scheme is somewhat more palatable than Clipper. Key   escrow is still unpopular with American computer and   software companies, which say it prevents them from   competing against foreign companies that have no similar   constraints, and with many multinational corporations,   which say it prevents them from working with foreign   companies that do not especially care for the idea of Uncle   Sam holding the keys to their data banks.   "If this was intended to be any sort of compromise, I don't   think it achieved its end," said Whitfield Diffie, a Sun   Microsystems engineer who attended the meetings. "I didn't   see anybody who was enthusiastic."   Raymond G. Kammer, deputy director of N.l.S.T., suggested   that the hearings last week were intended to elicit public   comment, and that the Administration's final position on   cryptographic policy were still under analysis.   But the emergence of key escrow issues at the N.l.S.T.   proceedings suggests that key escrow is emerging as a   nonnegotiable demand by some factions of the Clinton   Administration, especially the Justice Department and the   Federal Bureau of Investigation, led by Louis Freeh.   "If this fails," said a figure familiar with the   Administration's thinking on the proposed change in   cryptographic policy, "it's going to lead to a very   divisive debate. And the irony, for libertarians who oppose   key escrow, is that if it fails, I am convinced that Louis   Freeh cannot be true to his job without proposing domestic   controls on data encryption."   "He's not going to give up without a fight, and neither is   the Justice Department," said the figure, who spoke on the   condition he not be identified.   Others say they do not think the Clinton Administration has   yet arrived at a concrete position, even after more than a   year of study and debate. "I don't think it's a final   offer," said John Gilmore, an engineer at Cygnus Support,   a computer company in Mountain View, Calif. "It looks to me   like a weak strawman, a first offer, a proposal to dance."   The question is whether American citizens and businesses   have the patience to wait for the music to start. And the   issue may be moot, anyway because the Internet is no more   controlled by the United States than is the United Nations.   "The Internet Architecture Board has specifically decided   to ignore export controls in designing the security   infrastructure for the next generation of Internet   protocols," Mr. Gilmore said. "The Internet of 1998 will   provide automatic, secure, and fully private communication,   without key escrow, internationally."   In other words, the Internet community is already planning   to jump over the new line in the sand drawn last week by   the Administration. Cryptogrophy that is stronger than the   Government's proposed system will be built into the   Internet by a dozen countries, and American companies and   individuals would be foolish not to use it.   At that point, millions of Americans will come into direct   conflict with Government policy, and the popular   gun-control bumper sticker may be replaced by one that says   "If cryptography is outlawed, only outlaws will have   cryptography."

Holleyman, President, Business Software Alliance   On The Export of Software with Encryption Capabilities   September 6, 1995   National Insitute of Standards and Technology   Gaithersburg, MD   Introduction and Summary   My name is Robert Holleyman and I am President of the   Business Software Alliance ("BSA"). BSA promotes the   interests of the American software industry through its   programs in the United States and more than 60 countries   worldwide. Our members produce what is commonly referred to   as "mass market" or pre-packaged software and include such   leading companies as: Autodesk Inc., Bentley Systems, Inc.,   Intergraph Corp., Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft Corp.,   Novell, Inc., The Santa Cruz Operation, and Sybase, Inc.   These companies are among America's most internationally   competitive firms. Export sales for most of them account   for more than one-half of revenues. Overall, the American   software industry has a 75% worldwide market share for   pre-packaged software. Software has been one of the fastest   growing industries in the United States during the last 15   years and today is larger than all but five manufacturing   industries. Moreover, the industry has highly skilled,   highly paid jobs.   Unfortunately, the continued success and growth of our   industry is directly threatened by the United States   Government's continuing refusal to adopt realistic export   control policies. America's software companies still are   unable to sell worldwide software programs with encryption   features that will provide the strong information security   demanded by their customers.   *Specifically, the Administration's announcement last month   failed to provide immediate relief to software companies   because it did nothing to liberalize export controls on   generally available software employing non-key escrow   encryption. Moreover, the Administration's announcement and   the preliminary criteria set forth by NIST regarding key   escrow encryption continue to reflect a misunderstanding of   the market place and, if implemented in anything like their   current form, will prevent key escrow encryption from ever   being commercially adopted.*   The government has come forth with government designed   criteria focused entirely on fulfilling the government's   desire to be able to access encrypted information. But what   the government fails to recognize is that key escrow   encryption approaches must be commercially desirable and   voluntarily adopted. Computer users must want to buy   programs with such features. America's software companies   can't sell what users won t buy -- they have not become as   successful as they are by trying to force their customers   to purchase products with unwanted features. Therefore,   unless there is market demand for key escrow encryption,   software companies are not likely to produce programs with   such features.   Perhaps government officials believe that they know more   than American industry about what computer users worldwide   are demanding by way of information security. If that is   so, then we must strongly disagree. We also wonder about   the Administration's apparent decision to try and rely on   a few companies offering specialty hardware-based key   escrow encryption systems to "demonstrate" that they work   and that there is a market for such systems (even if a   limited one). Is the Administration really going to pick   winners and losers in the computing industries when it   comes to providing information security?   An even more ominous interpretation of the Administration's   recent announcements also suggests itself -- the government   is pursing a "Son of Clipper" strategy that could lead to   the *mandatory* use of key escrow encryption. How so?   Clearly the government is trying to force America's   software companies to include government sought key escrow   features in its software as the "price" for export   approval. Because of the companies' strong desire to   develop and sell a single version of their programs   worldwide, the government thus hopes to be able to have   users abroad and in the United States use software with   such key escrow encryption features. Even if, initially,   the domestic use of such government approved key escrow   encryption is only an option, it is easy to see how the   government could then pursue legislation making its use   mandatory and criminalizing the use of any other   encryption. After all, at that point the government could   argue that it was simply asking for Americans to use a   feature in their software they already have. Yet I can   assure you that the American software industry is not   interested in making the installed U.S. software base   "Clipper ready." (We also note that the government has said   it will propose revisions to the Escrow Encryption Standard   in line with the suggested criteria that will then cover   electronic computer communications, not just voice   communications!)   In short, the Administration's "new" encryption policy   appears to be little more than the old policy in new   clothing. It still does not enable American software   companies to export programs sought by their customers   worldwide.   Accordingly, we strongly urge the Administration to:   +  Immediately permit the export of generally available      software programs with non-key escrow encryption      capabilities employing the DES algorithm or other      algorithms at comparable strengths (56-bit key lengths)      to maintain the American software industry's      international competitiveness; and   +  Permit the export of software programs employing data      encryption and commercial key recovery systems: (1) with      algorithms using at least 64-bit key lengths; (2) in      which users in the U.S. or abroad are able to specify a      key holder: (3) the key recovery system will be bound to      the encryption function pursuant to good commercial      practices such that the time and effort involved in      by-passing the key recovery component or "spoofing" will      be greater than that necessary to simply employ very      strong (e.g. triple DES) non-key escrow encryption; (4)      the programs themselves will not provide for multiple      encryption; and (5) the system will identify the key      holder without notification to the party encrypting the      information.   Background   It has been three years since the U.S. Government permitted   the export of mass market software programs with moderate   encryption (i.e. with 40-bit keys). At that time, the   Government committed to permit stronger encryption over   time (i.e. to increase the key lengths) to provide adequate   information security against commercial attacks (given   advances in computing power) and maintain American   companies' international competitiveness (given the   proliferation of foreign manufactured programs with strong   encryption). But no further export control liberalization   occurred.   More than a year ago, Vice President Gore agreed to study   anew the short-run impact of existing export controls on   the American software industry's international   competitiveness and to reassess those controls based on the   studies. He also called for the government to work the   industry on exportable "key escrow encryption" systems that   would "provide strong encryption, acceptable through users   world wide. and address the national security needs as   well. Key escrow encryption system can permit the use of   very strong encryption (e.g. 128 bit keys) because the   government will be able to obtain the keys from third party   escrow agents in appropriate circumstances and thus be able   to decrypt information.   Unfortunately, during the last year American companies were   not permitted to increase the strength of the encryption in   their exportable programs and there was only minimal   consultation with the software industry with regards to   making commercial key escrow encryption systems a reality.   On August 1 7, 1994 the Administration announced a renewed   dialogue with industry to discuss key escrow encryption   issues, including proposed liberalization of export   controls for such software programs.   The Administration's Announcement Ignores The Immediate   Need To Liberalize Export Controls on Non-Key Escrow   Encryption Software Programs   The Administration's policy is silent with respect to   permitting the use of stronger encryption in exportable   generally available software programs. This means that   American software companies must continue to limit the   strength of their encryption to the 40-bit key length   levels first proposed in 1991 and adopted in 1992.   The failure to increase the key lengths reneges on the   commitment made by the government at that time to regularly   review and revise the strength of the encryption. The   insistence on the 40-bit key length also fails to   acknowledge that longer key lengths are the worldwide   standard. The refusal to change this standard denies the   existence of hundreds of foreign programs on the market   employing DES (with 56-bits keys) and other strong   encryption. Finally, it means that information encrypted at   the moderate level is subject to successful attack by those   employing commercially available resources (e.g. office   work stations at night). Further proof was widely reported   in the press just the other week: a French student at the   Ecole Polytechnique "cracked" the 40-bit RSA "export   version" security scheme used by Netscape Communications   Corp., a company which is working hard to make the GII a   commercial reality.   We understand that the Department of Commerce has recently   completed its latest study assessing the marketplace and   the availability of foreign programs and products. We are   confident that study confirms what our member companies'   marketing forces have reported for some time -- growing   availability of foreign programs and products offering   strong security features which stand to supplant U.S.   products if left unchecked. The White House has the study.   The time has come to recognize reality and rectify the   competitive disadvantage imposed on American industry.   The Administration's Proposed Criteria Will Prevent Key   Escrow Encryption From Ever Being Commercially Adopted   1. The Administration Fundamentally Misunderstands the      Marketplace.   The Administration's "new" policy as set forth in the   proposed criteria relies upon a government-designed   solution intended to satisfy the government's desire to be   able to access information. But it fails to understand the   two reasons why computer users in the office or at home may   want to use (and thus would be willing to buy) a commercial   key recovery encryption system.   First, users themselves may wish to be able to recover   their keys easily and conveniently from someone they trust.   A simple example will illustrate the point. When one of the   secretaries at our counsel's law firm was let go, in a fit   of pique she deleted six months worth of an attorney's   files. Fortunately, the law firm was able to recover these   files from its backup drives. But what if she had encrypted   those files and no one else had the key? Thus, corporations   have begun to express interest in the idea of an   arrangement whereby the information systems manager or   someone else in the company would hold the key. Similarly,   among individual users, the ability to recover a key in the   event it is lost or forgotten, coupled with possible ties   to authentication or directory services or improved ease of   use, could attract a number of users to a commercial key   recovery encryption approach.   It is important to understand, however, that users are   really only interested in the ability to recover the keys   to encrypted stored data -- files and such. None of our   customers has expressed any interest in a key recovery   system for communications. That's just not important to   them because the key is only useful for the duration of the   communication. Moreover, given the tremendous number of   communications the administrative burden could be   overwhelming.   The second reason why users might be willing to use a key   recovery system is the possibility of using much stronger   encryption in programs used worldwide. Because the   government ultimately would have access to encrypted   information if a key recovery system was employed there   really is no need to restrict the choice of algorithm or   limit the key lengths. Yet the Administration's new policy   would limit the strength of encryption keys to 64-bits when   used with a key recovery encryption svstem..   The greater the number of individuals at home and in   business who employ a key recovery encryption system, the   greater will be the government's ultimate access to   encrypted information. But a voluntary commercial key   recovery encryption system will be widely accepted only if   it is a market-driven process in which people want to have   others hold their keys. Yet the Administration's proposed   criteria outlines a system designed for the convenience of   the government -- not the user.   The government contemplates "certifying" a limited number   of key escrow encryption agents. It appears to envision   stringent qualifications and requirements. It seems   directed towards communications -- even though there is no   commercial demand for key recovery systems in this area. It   arbitrarily limits the key length size as well.   Importantly, it fails to address the key issue of the   ability of foreign parties to hold the keys for foreign   users.   Instead, it appears that the government has in mind   imposing a telephone-based model of surveillance on all   electronic information communications worldwide. We have   noted that the NIST statement did say that revisions were   being contemplated to the Escrow Encryption Standard to   cover electronic data transmitted over computer networks   (not just telephone networks).   2. Criteria For A Workable Commercial Key Recovery   Encryption System   Let's be clear from the start -- key escrow encryption or   key recovery encryption is not some "Holy Grail." Much as   there is not one religion for everyone, and within any one   religion there will always be skeptics, there are likely to   be some computer users worldwide who will not be interested   in letting anyone else "hold" their encryption keys. But at   the same time, as explained above, there are several market   driven reasons why many computer users might be interested   in such systems. And to the extent that such systems are   voluntarily employed within the United States and worldwide   then we believe the U.S. Government's interests would be   served because such systems ensure ultimate access to   encrypted information.   We believe commercial key recovery encryption systems that   users would want or accept, and thus could be sold, would   feature:   +  A variety of encryption algorithms using at least 64-bit      keys (and more likely much longer keys).   +  User specification of a key holder. While users must      have the choice of whom to give their keys, we believe      many if not most will gravitate towards significant      business entities as trusted third parties. Moreover, we      believe the Administration should take steps to      encourage -- but not require -- the formation of such      key holders. It also is essential that foreign parties      or entities be able to hold keys for foreign users. Yet      the Administration' s guidelines are very vague on this      point and seem to suggest that before this could occur      new bilateral agreements would have to be negotiated.      But unless and until American software companies know      that this is possible -- and thus there is a reasonable      prospect that foreign users will buy their programs --      they have no incentive or reason to proceed!   +  Binding the key recovery system to the encryption      function pursuant to good commercial practices such that      by-passing the key recovery component or "spoofing" the      system will require more time and effort than would be      involved in simply using very strong non-key escrow      encryption (e.g. triple DES; RC2 with 128 bit key) in      the first place.   +  The program will not itself provide for multiple      encryption. Thuss the system would not be designed so      that information could be encrypted by the program      itself more than once. Of course, no one can protect      against the problem of "super encryption" -- the problem      of someone encrypting information with a different non-      key recovery system program (e.g. DES) and then using      the program with the key recovery component.   +  Identify the key holder without notification to the      party encrypting the information. This could be done      through "headers" or other technological means.   It also should be remembered, however, that it is likely to   take two years or so --a product cycle -- to develop and   produce programs with commercial key recovery systems once   the decision is made to do so. So we are really talking   about a longer term approach -- which emphasizes yet again   the need for immediate export control liberalization for   non-key escrow encryption programs!   Conclusion   The continued delay in providing immediate relief to   American software companies by liberalizing export controls   on generally available software with non-key escrow   encryption capabilities is harming the software industry.   The Administration's inability to shake off the Clipper   mind set is effectively precluding the adoption of   realistic criteria for commercial key recovery encryption   systems. Perhaps most importantly, the future of the Global   Information Infrastructure and electronic commerce are   being jeopardized. Instead of paving the roads, the   Administration has left in place roadblocks on the   Information Highway.   The time for study is over. The time for action is now. The   American software industry deserves the right to be able to   compete in the world marketplace.   Let me be clear: we are entering a new wave of computing.   One in which consumers are demanding -- because they will   need -- security features to be able to access and exchange   data on a global basis. American software companies are   presently. and arbitrarily, forced to stand on the   sidelines as we enter this new era of computing, all   because of outmoded restrictions which limit the ability of   U.S. companies to sell programs abroad with greater than   40-bit key length encryption. Nothing in the   Administration's proposal will change this imbalance   because the proposal does not adequately recognize that a   key recovery system must be market driven, not government   imposed, for it to gain popular acceptance and widespread   utilization. By setting the bar too high, the   Administration risks failure in satisfying its security   objectives and, in doing so, takes the heretofore   competitive American software industry out of its most   important emerging market.   It need not be this way. We urge the Administration to   re-think its current proposal and work with the software   industry to devise truly workable, market driven, criteria   for exportable software programs with information security   features.   Thank you.   [End] B�Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

It is exciting to see   progress made on the export of better cryptography. The   goal of the government to accept products into the new   program by the end of this year is an impressive one.   Towards that goal, TIS offers the following comments on the   NIST discussion papers.   2    Criteria for Criteria   It is very important that the final criteria are, as stated   in the NIST discussion paper, *the objectives, but not the   exact technical method(s), by which those objectives are   satisfied*. The criteria must also be   +    Relevant -- the criteria must focus on meeting the        government's goals.   +    Objective -- the criteria cannot be subject to        interpretation. Vendors cannot use criteria that        change with each review of a product or each new        product.   +    Achievable -- the criteria must be implementable by        vendors. This will meet the goal of both government        and industry to export better cryptography.   +    Acceptable -- the criteria must be accepted by, and        result in systems that are accepted by:        - the U.S. government with respect to export policy,        - industry with respect to the vendors implementing          compliant systems,        - users who will buy the products, and        - the international community that will           import compliant products.   One must be careful not to start down the *How to* path for   each of the issues presented. That is the job of each   solution provider. Even though the issues begin with *how   to*, attention must instead be focused on the particular   government interest at issue, and each solution provider   must be allowed to determine how to address that interest.   The following include a few other traps that the criteria   process must avoid.   2.1  Don't Specify Commercial Criteria   The criteria process must focus on the criteria that the   government will use for determining compliance for export.   There are plenty of additional relevant criteria for   creating a good escrow encryption system. The job is not to   specify the best, or even a good, system. Rather, it is to   make sure that applicable government requirements are   specified, and no more.   2.2  Don't Exceed the Minimum   The criteria process must focus on the minimum requirements   necessary to achieve compliance for export. The   Clipper/Capstone LEAF represents a starting point for the   functionality of escrowed communication. The criteria must   not exceed that functionality.   2.3  Don't Allow Criteria Creep   Criteria Creep must be avoided. Once criteria for export   are established, they should remain static. Each vendor   should be evaluated against the same criteria.   2.4  Don't Solve the Dual Rogue Problem   The criteria process should not attempt to solve the dual   rogue (two cooperating entities bypassing key escrow)   problem. Clipper does not solve it. Mike Nelson at the   August 17 announcement clearly stated that compliant   solutions are not expected to solve it. The criteria   process must not attempt to write criteria that try to   solve it.   2.5  Don't Over Protect   Any criteria process dealing with protection of key escrow   mechanisms should evaluate whether it is easier or cheaper   to write or procure compatible non-escrowed encryption than   to disable the escrow mechanism of a compliant product.   Remember that the use of key escrow-based encryption is not   required for anyone, domestically or internationally. There   will always be other choices available. The criteria should   be that defeating the exportable key escrow mechanisms   cannot be accomplished at a cost lower than using an   alternative. This is clearly a balancing act of risk   management; there are no absolute answers.   3    Nomenclature   The software key escrow community must use a generic   nomenclature that does not suggest any particular   implementation or solution. Unfortunately, the NIST issues   are written using terms that in many cases specifically   describe the Clipper implementation. For example, the   criteria should be written to refer to *third party agents*   instead of key escrow agents. Not all third party agents   are key escrow agents. The criteria should deal with   *decrypting information* instead of keys. The exact   placement of the keys may differ with each solution. In   general, the terms used in the criteria should not suggest   an implementation or make any assumptions about an   implementation.   4    Issues for Escrowed Encryption Products   The following sections address each of the issues raised in   the NIST Discussion Paper #1. Each section begins with the   *issue as stated by NIST*.   4.1  Avoiding Multiple Encryption        *How can the product be designed so as to prevent        doubling (or tripling, etc.) the key space of the        algorithm?*   Ensuring that the product itself does not provide a feature   of doubling or tripling the key space of encryption is a   relevant and reasonable requirement. It is in the   government's interest to mitigate the risk of a breakdown   of the key escrow mechanism by limiting the key space   allowed by compliant products. It is also necessary to   ensure that the product cannot be modified to allow   doubling or tripling from within a compliant product. This   requires the same protections, and the same level of   assurance, as the later issue of protecting the product   from being modified to disable the escrow mechanism.   However, ensuring that the product cannot be used multiple   times to double or triple encryption constitutes trying to   solve the dual rogue problem. Any use of a product outside   of its features requires the cooperation of both the   encrypting and decrypting party. Even though this is the   dual rogue problem, because it is of special interest to   the government, it should be explored in more detail.   First, if a compliant product is used multiple times, then   each key will be escrowed. Second, if a product is to   prevent itself from being used multiple times, then it must   maintain state about how it was used. A rogue application   can always be written that will require 1 more bit of state   than the product maintains, thus defeating any mechanism   attempting to prevent multiple passes over the same data.   4.2  Disabling Key Escrow Mechanism        *How can products be made resistant to alteration that        would disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism?        How can the "static patch" problem be avoided? How can        this be tested?*   Resisting the disabling or circumvention of the key escrow   mechanism is a relevant and reasonable export requirement.   This requirement appears in several forms in the issue   list. It should probably be stated in the positive, that   escrowed encryption products must always use the escrow   feature when encrypting. This criterion must apply   +    during product distribution and initialization,   +    in spite of attempts to disable the escrow mechanism        by altering the software, and   +    in spite of postprocessing the output from a compliant        product.   Each of these issues needs to be looked at separately.   The first issue is that the escrow feature is always used   for a successful encryption, even if encryption is   attempted during product distribution and initialization.   This prevents a user from subverting the system by failing   to perform some initialization step. There are several   methods for vendors to meet this criteria.   Protecting the integrity of the software presents   interesting problems but gives rise to creative solutions   as well. The ability to meet any criteria relies on the   integrity of the software. It is also very important for   vendors to identify the integrity boundary of their   products. There will be a subset of the product that is   integrity protected. Alteration of the portion of the   product that is not integrity protected should not affect   the compliance of the product with any of the agreed-upon   criteria.   Postprocessing the cyphertext to remove the escrow   information presents certain difficult issues and needs to   be addressed separately from the integrity of the software.   Since postprocessing can be done outside of the escrowed   encryption product, the only way to prevent it is to make   it detectable or harder to accomplish than using a   different encryption method. Remember, too, that the   purpose of having private escrow systems is to provide   users with functionality as well. Postprocessing the   cyphertext removes the user's ability to use the features   of the escrow system as well.   4.3  Access To Escrow Information        *What mechanisms must be designed into encryption        products to allow authorized access to escrowed keys?        This likely includes the identity of the key escrow        agent(s) and a serial number for the key escrow agent        to use to identify the key(s)/component(s) necessary        to decrypt the message. What other information will be        necessary to be provided to the escrw agent to        identify the necessary key(s)/components(s)? Are there        other comparable viable approaches?*   This issue should to be restated to focus on the objective,   rather than on the mechanisms. Both the government's and   the commercial user's objective is that each encrypted   object identifies the information necessary for the   decryption of the object. This identity information must be   available to law enforcement (and the user, for that   matter) without any cryptographic processing.   4.4  Non-escrowed Use        *How can products be made so that they do not function        with non-escrowed products (or tampered escrowed        products)? How can this be tested?*   There are two separate reasons for this issue. This issue   addresses both the prevention of postprocessing of messages   and the promotion of the use of escrow-enabled products.   The first issue in nonescrowed use is the prevention of   postprocessing of messages to remove the escrow   information. If prevention of this attack is the goal, then   we need to focus on this as a threat and decide on possible   countermeasures. Outlawing interoperability is only one   possible countermeasure.   The second issue is the promotion of the proliferation of   escrow-enabled products. The promotion of the use of the   products is not a relevant requirement for the export of   the product. Whether a product, or technology, succeeds or   fails in the marketplace is not a relevant criteria for   export. Furthermore, requiring compliant products to refuse   interaction with noncompliant products may, in fact, have   the opposite effect. The following scenarios will   illustrate the point.   +    *Compliant xmtr and compliant rcvr*. There is no issue        here.   +    *Compliant xmtr and noncompliant rcvr*. There should        be no issue here. Since the xmtr is compliant, the        information necessary for law enforcement access will        be transmitted, and law enforcement needs are met.   +    *Noncompliant xmtr and compliant rcvr*. Here is the        alleged problem. The xmtr does not transmit the        information necessary for law enforcement. However, in        the world of commercial business, the receiver cannot        dictate how people send information, so in order to be        compatible with the noncompliant xmtr the receiver        moves to a noncompliant product. This hinders the use        of escrow enabled technology. Rather than having at        least one side of the conversation using this        technology, forcing the issue will result in no side        using it.   +    *Noncompliant xmtr and noncompliant rcvr*. There is no        issue here. Neither of the products falls under these        criteria.   Do not underestimate the need for interoperability for   product vendors. This issue can take many forms. There are   already interoperability standards for encrypted electronic   mail, such as the MIME Object Security Standard (MOSS). If   new products cannot interoperate with the existing   products, then the early adopters will have no one to   communicate with and will not promote the product.   A different form of the interoperability problem is within   a product family. If a company makes an investment in one   of the third party DES encryption products available today   and later purchases compliant exportable products for use   overseas, this would set up the compliant/noncompliant   problem. It is unlikely that a company will also upgrade   all of its domestic products. It is more likely that they   will find an interoperable product overseas.   Even if product vendors do not achieve full   interoperability between compliant and noncompliant   products due to technical issue and design decisions, a   government mandate against interoperability is not an   answer. Allowing the marketplace to control   interoperability lets it decide how important it is in   order to sell a product. Vendors will provide what is   necessary in order to sell their products. The government   criteria should not be used as a reason for products to   fail. That is a lose-lose proposition.   4.5  Limiting Surveillance        *How can products be designed so that information both        sent and received by the user can be decrypted without        release of keys of other users?*   This issue must be looked at with an understanding of the   nature of the communication method. Electronic mail is a   store-and-forward, one-way communication. The information   is protected by the sender until the receiver receives the   message and completes its half of the key exchange and   decryption. It is not realistic to expect to be able to   read a subject's incoming mail without the release of some   information from the escrow system of the transmitter. A   Capstone LEAF in a mail message does not do this. A new   system should not have to, either.   Access to both directions of communication with the release   of information from the third party for only one of the   users is reasonable for two-way communication.   4.6  Practical Key Access        *How can mechanisms be designed so that repeated        involvement of escrow agents is not required for        decryption for multiple files/messages during the        specified access period?*   Here is an example of the wording implying a specific   solution. Not all systems have escrow agents. The true   issue for the government is that there is some range of   acceptable interaction with the escrow system (a collection   of elements) for repeated decryptions under the same   authorization. Every system proposed will be involved in   every decryption. The issue is the form of that   interaction. The eventual criteria must specify what is   expected both in the form of human interaction and in the   form of automated interaction.   4.7  Assurance That Keys Are Escrowed        *How can it be assured that key escrow products are        indeed satisfactorily escrowed? For example, products        could be required to be escrowed at time of        manufacture or be made inoperable until properly        escrowed.*   This is a subset of Disabling Key Escrow. Phrased   differently, can one circumvent key escrow specifically by   not initializing the system properly? This should be   discussed with the other attacks to disable or circumvent   key escrow.   4.8  Ability to Re-Escrow Keys        *How can products be designed so that new keys can be        escrowed at the user's discretion with a U.S.        Government approved escrow agent?*   It is not clear what this issue means. It suggests two   different criteria. First, it suggests that if the   underlying cryptographic system allows, or even expects,   users to periodically change the keys that they use, then   the escrow system must also allow users to do this. It is   not relevant to the government's interests to require a   system to change keys. It is good practice to change keys,   but the government criteria must be limited to those issues   relevant to meeting the government interests.   Second, this issue suggests that there are multiple third   party agents to choose from. It is vital to the commercial   acceptance of escrowed encryption that the criteria allow   for a choice of third party agent.   4.9  Certified Escrow Agents        *Can products be designed so that only escrow agents        certified by the U.S. Government (domestic, or under        suitable arrangements, foreign) are utilized? What        should be the criteria for an acceptable U.S. escrow        agent?*   It is relevant that escrow systems make sure that they are   dealing with valid agents for the proper operation of the   system. However, whether the government is in a position to   certify agents is another question.   The entire issue of government certification of escrow   agents and the criteria used should be separated from the   discussion of the product criteria. This issue should be   removed from the product list and discussed with the escrow   agent issues list.   5    Criteria for Key Escrow Agents   The following sections address each of the issues raised in   the NIST Discussion Paper #2. Each section begins with the   issue as stated by NIST. The section titles are the   editor's.   Before examining this set of issues, it is necessary to   examine the basis for establishing any criteria for third   party agents. There is no basis for the certification of   escrow agents for use within the United States. There is no   legal authority or budget appropriation for a certification   activity. The only basis would be for escrow agents in the   United States used in conjunction with exported escrowed   products. Remember, these criteria are only for the purpose   of determining exportability.   However, most importing nations of escrowed encryption will   require the entire system to be subject to their laws. They   will not import the encryption products without the   software or hardware used by the third party agents. The   real issue is the criteria for allowing export of the   software and systems used by the third party agents, not   the criteria for approving the organizations within the US.   For purely domestic use, there is no basis for approving   the agents. Authorizing legislation would be required to   form a basis for any criteria. Futhermore, it is not   entirely clear that government specified criteria   regulating a domestic activity for the purpose of achieving   exportability would be considered to have a rational basis   by a court. Were such legislation to pass muster, however,   it would have to fundamentally accept that the use of   escrowed encryption domestically is a voluntary action that   a user might take in order to gain the benefits of   emergency recovery or other authorized third party access.   Appropriation legislation would also be required to allow   any licensing authority to exist and function. Given the   pace of legislation, and the current reluctance to expand   government operations, it is imperative that the deployment   of these systems not rely on the passage of legislation.   5.1  Exclusion of Organizations        *What kinds of organizations should be excluded from        consideration as approved key escrow agents?*   Criteria must be positive and objective. Even discussing   the concept of exclusion sets the stage for charges of   restraint of trade and discrimination. There can be no   preconceived notion about who might be able to meet a set   of criteria.   5.2  Legal Agreements        *What sort of legal agreement between the government        and the key escrow agent is necessary to stipulate the        responsibilities of the agent? Should this include the        terms and conditions under which release of a key is        required?*   This is not a criteria for third party agents. Any third   party agent is subject to the laws of its local   jurisdiction. If located in the United States, a third   party agent is subject to Federal, State, and local laws.   If current law does not address key escrow with enough   specificity, perhaps legislation would be in order.   Complying with any new legislation would not require the   certification of third party agents; it would just mean   they could comply more uniformly with the laws of their   respective jurisdictions.   5.3  Liability        *How will liability for unauthorized release of key be        handled?*   This is not a relevant concern of the government. Civil   liability is entirely a business concern of the third party   agent, not a criteria of the government. Third party agents   will be set up to be in business and to stay in business.   State statutory law, common law, as well as business   considerations will dictate how liability is managed.   5.4  Criminalization        *Should, for example, intentionally misreleasing or        destroying a key be criminalized? Should this include        other actions?*   Destroying the ability to perform recovery (note the more   generic wording) is a relevant concern of both the   government and the business users of an escrow service.   Misreleasing a key may not hamper the government's ability   to meet its needs, but it certainly would cause the users   to lose faith in the escrow system, which could then hamper   the government's ability to meet its interests. If a third   party destroys its ability to perform recovery, it has put   itself out of business, preventing its clients and the   government from accessing the information of its clients.   Even so, this is a subject for legislation, not   certification. Amendments to existing laws may be   sufficient to provide the requisite deterrent and   punishment.   5.5  Investigation Confidentiality        *How can the government's needs for confidentiality of        key release be handled?*   The third party agents are subject to the laws of their   local jurisdictions. If the authorization presented to the   third party agent requires confidentiality, and many, if   not all, do, the government's needs are met. If it does   not, then the government needs to change the wording of its   authorizations or create legislation that specifically sets   forth appropriate confidentiality requirements.   5.6  Public Key Infrastructure        *Should approval of key escrow mechanisms be tied to        a public key infrastructure (for digital signatures        and other purposes)?*   It would be beneficial for key escrow mechanisms to use a   public key infrastructure, but the development and   deployment of key escrow technology cannot and should not   be tied to the development and deployment of a public key   infrastructure.   5.7  Storage and Safeguarding of Keys        *What procedures need to be developed for the storage        and safeguarding of keys?*   First, the issue really is, what steps has the third party   taken to make sure that it can perform recovery? The   government's needs and the needs of the commercial   marketplace coincide here. The better the security, the   more trust a customer will have in the third party agent.   What steps will a third party agent take to make sure that   it can stay in business? Standard commercial practices will   naturally increase the level of security.   5.8  Performance Criteria        *What are the acceptable performance criteria (e.g.,        around-the-clock availability, accessibility,        reliability, etc.) for approved key escrow agents?*   This is the only relevant criteria where the government's   needs may exceed those of the commercial marketplace.   However, unless the government is willing to pay for the   cost of service above and beyond what is provided to the   marketplace, one must look at reasonable compromises that   third party agents can take to meet government needs   without putting themselves out of business. For example,   staffing a third party agency 7 days for 24 hours may be   prohibitive. But making sure that there is always a point   of contact with a beeper who can respond within a   reasonable amount of time (measured in hours, not minutes)   is reasonable.   5.9  Export of Third Party Components        *Under what circumstances will key escrow agents in        foreign countries be approved?*   This is really the key question. From the U.S. government   point of view, there must be appropriate bilateral   agreements with the importing country to allow the   importing country to retrieve the recovery information and   share it with the United States in a timely fashion, and   vice versa. This is not a relevant criteria that a product   vendor can influence. The government must take the lead in   auditing and augmenting its international police agreements   to allow its new policy to work.   5.10 Approval Process        *What process will be used to approve escrow agents?        Costs/who pays?*   After reviewing the issues, there does not appear to be a   legal basis and or legitimate need for a government   approval process. The issues are handled by following the   laws of the jurisdiction of the third party agent and by   following good commercial practice. If the government   determines that new legislation would clarify the   application of existing laws for the escrowed encryption   scenario, TIS would welcome discussions on the content of   such new legislation.   6    An Alternative to Government Certified Third Party        Agents   Commercial vendors are also very concerned about third   party agents. The failure of any third party agents casts   a shadow on the entire escrow system. The vendors of key   escrow systems will do everything that is commercially   reasonable to ensure the proper and successful operation of   the third party agents.   It is expected that vendors will apply commercial criteria   to "who can license" their systems. Commercial criteria   could include requiring a corporate certificate of good   standing, credit reports, and perhaps insurance or bonding   requirements. Rather than sell escrow components outright,   vendors may license components to operators with licensing   terms that specify performance criteria.   Compare this to government certification. The government   would still have to operate with objective,   nondiscriminatory criteria that would include certificates   of good standing, credit reports, etc. The only additional   criteria that the government has at its disposal is the   ability to perform background checks on the principals of   a third party agent. However, this may not be acceptable to   commercial business interested in running a third party   agency domestically. Furthermore, anyone can be a third   party agent for domestic use today with no restriction   whatsoever. In order for the government to apply any   criteria, legislation would have to be passed. This will   take time. Industry can, and will for its own purposes,   start applying commercial criteria immediately.   The marketplace is very incented to ensure the successful   operation of third party agents. The government interest is   limited to ensuring that the laws for searches and wiretaps   can be executed appropriately. Let industry lead in this   area, and both the government interests and industry   interests will be met.   7    Conclusion   There are several relevant, objective, achievable, and   acceptable criteria for the export of escrowed encryption   products that are necessary to meet the interests of the   government. They must be stated in a clear, generic form   that captures the true, concise objective to be met and not   the mechanism to use.   There are not, however, relevant, objective, achievable,   and acceptable criteria for the certification of third   party agents. The government must understand the   applicability of the existing laws that govern evidence   gathering and work with the vendors of third party products   to allow the marketplace to set the standards for third   party agents.

Please note that there is a separate conference next week on creating a FIPS PUB standard for key escrow. That standard will be promulgated, just as GOSIP, POSIX and Clipper/Skipjack were promulgated. This export conference was separate from that FIPS standardization process. I got stuck in a construction traffic jam, and missed the introductoryspeaches. Perhaps one of the other c'punks can fill us all in on what Imissed. The first item is that the export criteria will be changed. A small numberof bits will be added to unescrowed crypto, and 64-bit escrow'd (GAK'd)systems will be allowed. They don't care which algorithm is used, DES, RC4,blowfish, etc. They care about key length. If it is short enough, it isexportable. The conference seemed to be an attempt to co-opt industry into agreeingthat 64-bit GAK is much better than the current situation. After all,it would be too strong for a "hacker in France" to break it. When they opened the floor, there were a few comments/questionsthat indicated that not everyone was convinced that this was a good thing.I pointed out some graduate students don't consider "hacker" a compliment,and that I thought Damian did a great job breaking RC4-40. I also pointedout that it was broken again in 31 hours with a "bunch of commercialsystems, Sun and Pentiums" with no need for supercomputers. I then asked if the criteria were fixed, as setting criteria controls theresult. The NIS&T approved board said that changes to the criteria was part of why the conference was being held. The next hour and a half was presentation from "industry." Essentiallycomments on the proposal. Nearly all of the spokesmen said that the criteriawere flawed. Some said that they already had commercial productsthat met most of the real needs of the industry (key recovery) but theydidn't meet the NIS&T/NSA "criteria." Probably the strongest was thecondamnation by Robert Holleyman of the Business Software Alliance. Hollyman said that BSA represents firms such as Microsoft, Novell, Lotus,Sybase, SCO, Autodesk, and Intergraph. He said that current policy "directlythreatens" the industry because of "The US Government's continuing refusalto adopt realistic export control policies." He went on and on.It was clear that his position is that the proposed policy is a mistake.Follow this link for a copy of the BSA presentation. After the presentations, there were more questions. I proposed oneadditional criteria (based on email that I received from the c'punks):How do we expire court approved access to encrypted data, so that once thecourt orders are over, the LEAs no longer have the ability to decrypt.The answer was that with clipper, special hardware is needed, and it goesaway when the court order does. I asked how that model worked in a softwareonly world. There were mumbled statements about adding it as a criteria. The conference then broke for lunch and breakout groups. The one I was indiscussed criterias 5 and 6 of Topic 3, published in my URLhttp://www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/nistmeeting.htmlThey are short enought to reproduce here. 5. The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be disabled by a static patch, (i.e., the replacement of a block of code by a modified block). 6. The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted by non-escrowed products, including products whose key escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled. After I commented that the person writing the notes has the ability todetirmine what was said, the folks from NSA and NIS&T asked me to take the notes. I love it; but I did try to be objective. In the middle of this discussion, a government-generated, but anonymnouspaper was distributed. It had "Example Suggested Solutions." It suggestedthat source code not be available for products suitable for export. It alsosuggested other ideas, such as storing a checksum/hash and having thesystem "check the cryptographic code several times during its use." There was a strong reaction against these suggestions, not because they werebad ideas, but because the paper was delivered with no prior publication.This precluded any planned response to its ideas. We reworded #5 to say "want to Trust the Product." This means that it is untampered, works as expected, etc. We then hashed out ways to know this. The list ended up looking like: is available only as object code contains some "hash" function to check for modifications contains some unique hash, with uniqueness based upon something like "site," "per copy" or "per release" Contains policies against modification, such as liscense language against decompilation. OS-related security, such as runs "protected mode" instead of as a wild DOS program. Of course, the software vendors went wild against "per copy" identifiers,saying it would add two orders of magnitude worth of problems to manufacturing. The items on the list were not "must have all of these" rather it wasa pick-and-chose menu. We also required that the standard allowfor technical innovation to keep up with the evolving state of the art. The discussion of #6 was more lively. We took a long time figuring out whatit said. For instance, could ViaCrypt sell a product that was compatiblewith PGP 2.6.2 (non-escrowed) that also worked with the new escrowedciphers? It seems to me, and a lot of other folks there, that such a productwould be non-exportable. We simplified the criteria to: "right products won't talk to wrong products."with "right products" meaning those that are exportable, and wrong productsbeing those that aren't, or are hacked, or ... We then developed "goals" including: 1. One version for sale worldwide 2. Allow development in the US 3. Domestic Law Enforcement Agencies want Escrowed (I almost wrote GAK :-) 4. Must interoperate with everything 5. Receiver can only decrypt if escrow agencies can decrypt. This leads to a bunch of issues and observations, including:a. Can goals 1, 2, and 4 be met simultaneously? There was a suggestion of a "friendly man-in-the-middle" who wouldreceive a GAK'd conversation, and strip off the GAK parts, and reencryptit, and retransmit it to a non-GAK user. Which leads to:b. Can we prohibit a friendly MITM? The big issue was:c. Startup compatibility. No one will buy products unless they havesales attractiveness. This means compatibility with existing systems.Yet the criteria #6 seems to say that approved products must refusebackwards compatibility. This was labeled a "non starter" by the group. The consensus was that companies can develop a substantial competitiveadvantage by developing off-shore and offering both escrowed encryptionand compatibility with existing systems.There was a discussion of grandfathering in some technologies.This was to help interoperability. The conversation became fuzzy,Grandfather technologies included DES, 3-DES, IDEA, and long key RC4.One key idea was that it may make sense to allow software that encrypts withescrowed keys, but can also decrypt with any algorithm. This allows the LEA'sto access outgoing messages, while allowing interoperability. The discussions frequently wandered to discuss the language of the criteria.The wording was considered simultaneously too subjective and impractical.For example, we considered the phrase "tamper resistant" to be preferable to the original "prevent tampering," because it is impossible to absolutlyprevent modification to software. The issue of interoperability was raised repeatedly. It is critical that exportable products interoperate with other,existing export products. The last issue in the session was that the length of the key, 64-bits,was defined in criteria #1. There was no discussion at the conference onthis criteria. It seems that the NIS&T and NSA folks believe thatthis is a closed topic. The folks in the session did not agree. Theyfelt that 64-bits was not enough. Once the breakout session was over, the entire conference met together, and the "reporter" from each session reported their comments and findings. All breakout sessions had suggested changes. The group that discussedcriteria #9 recommended removing it. The group that discussed criteria #2 (no multiple encryption) reported that industry was working on a general solution to the problem of key recovery, and that their solution would probably appear as quickly without the government's "help." Several groups identified that there are at least two separate problem domains: communications and data storage. Communications typically is short term, and has unique keys for each session. Data storage has far fewer keys that are usedfor long periods. Several speakers suggested that while communicationskeys were not suited to be escrowed, there was a large need forkey recovery for data storage. There was no response from the governmentrepresentatives to any of these points. One government speakerdid say that there would be a Federal key escrow standard, period. After the combined session, there were more break-out sessions. In the onethat I attended, the folks from National Semiconductor described theirCAKE system. This is a smartcard/PCMCIA device that uses 2000+ bit public/private key encryption and signatures. They are hoping for exportapproval; it is necessary for the project to be viable. The system lookspretty interesting, but it too complicated to describe here. In short, random session keys are generated and signed with a Data Recovery Center'spublic key. The LEAs could then send encrypted session keys to the DRC, which would decrypt them, and return the unencrypted session keys whichthe LEA could then used to decrypt the messages. While this is a hardware system, its concepts could be transfered to a software implementation. One obvious problem is that NS' system doesn't meet criteria #8 (retuiringrepeated involvement of the escrow agent), since it may requirehundreds or thousands of session key decipherments. It also hasa number of attractive features, such as never sending the privatekey anywhere, only the session key is escrowed. The general discussion showed concerns that in the internationalcommunity, requiring government escrow may cause loss of valuable data,as some foriegn governments are not as trustworthy as the US. It wasthe consensus that requiring users to have 50 or more escrow centers wasunworkable. Yet this could be required for large multinational companiesworking in 50 or more countries, if each required a local key escrow service. The NS model would allow both date stamping of session keys, and periodicrekeying. Either would satisfy my "unaccepted" Citeria #11, technicallimits to the time that a court ordered decryption could be executed. There was a discussion of changing the criteria so that only the transmissionof data was concerned with escrow. This would simplify the issue ofmultinational escrow. We did not resolve whether this would be sufficientor acceptable. Thursday, we will talk about suitable escrow agencies. Pat Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

I am Shabbir J.Safdar from the VTW (Voters Telecommunications Watch). VTW is a publicadvocacy organization based in New York City. We monitor civilliberties issues in telecommunications for the public and when civilliberties coincides with good business practices, small businessinterests. There are a number of problems with the key escrow proposals (bothClipper and Commercial Key Escrow) that have been put before us. Today Iwill be addressing some of the problems with the current proposal andexploring some myths surrounding the debate. For further information, you can reach VTW at:	Listserver:	listproc@vtw.org	Email:	vtw@vtw.org	WWW:	http://www.vtw.org	Gopher:	gopher -p1/vtw gopher.panix.com TRUE OR FALSE? True or False: Industry is clamoring for key escrow True. Industry is not, however, clamoring to put their keys in the hands ofdisinterested third parties. True or False: Export controls are preventing foreign adversaries fromobtaining commercial cryptographic technology This is true if we're speaking of US commercial cryptographic technology,but false if we�re speaking about the hundreds of products availableoverseas. As recently as this year Colombia declared a state ofemergency and used that opportunity to conduct a number of raids onsuspected Cali Cartel offices. They found that Cartel members were usingencryption to hide stored data files containing counter-intelligenceinformation, encryption devices to hide their real time communications,and were also conducting their own surveillance program on the Colombianlaw enforcement�s communications. Presumably, they did not have a warrant. (References for this incident can be found in the May 26th 1995 WallStreet Journal cover story and the July 3, 1995 Baltimore Sun.) True or False: Export controls are preventing foreign adversaries fromobtaining public domain cryptographic technology False. The availability of public domain PGP overseas is currently asomewhat tired but true joke within forums such as this one. In addition,the newest product in the PGP family, PGPFone, was released for downloadon the Internet for US and Canadian sites only. With explicit warnings andannoying measures in place, it clearly informed the user (who could notdownload it without being on a site within the US or Canada) that exportof PGPFone outside the US violated ITAR. PGPFone was available on a European server three days and four hourslater. Issues raised by the use of key escrow agents OVERSIGHT Because the event of releasing a key is in and of itself secret, it is verydifficult for an insider within the escrow structure to report wrongdoingwithout compromising their knowledge of an investigation. As we know from experience, oversight of a secret government processdoes not work adequately to engender public trust. NO EVIDENCE OF A MARKET ABROAD FOR ESCROWED PRODUCTS There is no evidence that suggests that there is a market abroad forcommercial key escrow products. Contrary to the statements andoptimism of the fine gentleman from the White House, it is unlikely thatChina will allow its citizenry to use communications products it cannotwiretap. Considering that these people have first-hand experience with a tyrannicalregime and it potential for damage, it is unlikely that Chinese dissidentswill use key escrowed devices knowing that they can be accessed by thegovernment. DAMAGE STEMMING FROM A WRONGFUL DISCLOSURE IS TOO HIGH The damages an escrow agent might be responsible for in the case of awrongful key release is going to be greater than anyone can afford. Imagine the amount of money that is involved in a campaign, a new patent,a new pharmaceutical drug, or a financial acquisition. Who can afford tobe liable for such damages? DOCUMENTS LIVE FOREVER UNDER KEY ESCROW The escrow agents can never be allowed to destroy a key, because you cannever prove that you have stopped using a key. This means that if yourtraditional records management system involves destroying an encrypteddocument and its decryption keys after seven years. Under commercial key escrow you will now have to worry about theexistence of any document or communication forever because there willalways be a decryption key available. In addition, because people tend tobe less careful with transmission and storage of encrypted documents(because, after all they're encrypted) the likelihood of someone havingmade a rogue copy is more likely than under a non-key escrowedencryption system where you would have used a Brinks-mailed floppy diskinstead of an open-line transfer. ESCROW AGENTS CANNOT ENFORCE CONSTRAINTS OF THE WARRANT Because law enforcement agents are not involved in the collection of theseized material, they cannot verify that when they are presented with awarrant, that the officers in question acted in a manner appropriate to thejudge's orders. Escrow agents are then reduced to nothing more thansafety deposit box services. Although this might meet the needs of lawenforcement, this does not support the requirement of trust between thepublic and the escrow agent. VOLUNTARY KEY ESCROW IS NOT CREDIBLE Although the word voluntary has been bandied about publicly throughoutthe Administration's key escrow debacle, the FBI, the NSA, and theDepartment of Justice have all stated in documents obtained through theFreedom of Information Act that for key escrow to work, other forms ofnon-escrowed cryptography must be criminalized. Although this is nosurprise to anyone who has thought about the problem, this casts doubt onthe Administration�s commitment to the continued availability of otherforms of cryptography. These documents can be found on the ElectronicPrivacy Information Center World Wide Web site at URL:http://www.epic.org. In addition, the very fact that escrowed products are going to enjoypreferential export treatment (64 bits versus 40 bits), indicates that achoice between escrowed and non-escrowed products is not a voluntarychoice, but one weighted with inappropriate incentives. WIRETAP ABUSES DO OCCUR Although it gives us no joy to point it out, throughout recent history therehave been cases of abuses of surveillance authority. It makes no sense toempower an already human-fallible system with additional powers suchthat the magnitude and damage of the human errors is increased. EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS AN INAPPROPRIATE LOCATION FOR BOTH ESCROWAGENTS AND ESCROW AGENTS' REGULATORY AGENCIES The regulatory structure that has been discussed so far involves theregulation of escrow agents solely by the Executive Branch. Thus far noone has suggested that legislation is necessary, though many havesuggested that it might be an alternative. Should final regulatory authority rest entirely within the ExecutiveBranch, escrow agents would be subject to the political whims ofwhatever the current administration felt was appropriate. A process thatdoes not have an appeals escape clause (one that allows you to predict thenumber of appeals you will have to file and when you will be appealing toa judicial body) can arbitrarily control the actions of escrow agents. Without a judicial appeals process that goes outside the executivebranch, a key escrow agent or a key escrow customer will end up appealingto the very same agency that is a party to any dispute. CONCLUSION It is an interesting game that we play here today with extremely highstakes. We continually fight over what some call the "grey area" of accessto data and communications. Public advocates assert that lawenforcement enjoys significant access to data already, but that aguarantee of access to data is not acceptable. Law enforcement insists that the public has significant ability to keepdata confidential, but that a guarantee of confidentiality is notacceptable. It is not clear if there is a middle ground where both these parties canfind solace, but key escrow (either commercial key escrow or throughgovernment held keys) is not that middle ground.

It turns out I know the guywho was running the conference so I knew I couldn't miss it...and I knew Ihad to wear my Cypherpunks t-shirt to show the flag (and it stood out, asthere were few without suits there). I got to meet Dorothy Denning for thefirst time. I was mentioning how government key-escrow doesn't sound toobad to some in the libertarian/cypherpunk world, say for instance toensure FOIA requests are not encrypted away. She said that would never bea problem, just getting the government to give you FOIA documents in thefirst place is the problem. In a nutshell, this was a conference to begin work on a FIPS for software key encryption escrow. Industry people there felt that a FIPS would be a great way to standardize key escrow for data recovery. However, except for one guy at IBM who said they tap employees phones alot, most industry people felt that it was not needed for tapping their real-time communications. There was a lot of talk from government people about the need for Law Enforcement to get access to encrypted real-time communication between government employees. This, to say the least, squicked many attendees, and there seemed to be much tension between the sides on that issue. I asked a couple of industry people and privacy advocates the question "AmI just paranoid, or is this FIPS a trial balloon for mandated civilliankey escrow?" I got many "yes" answers. I also heard the occasional "thissounds like son-of-clipper" comments in the breakout groups. One noteworthy point is that RSA sent in a position paper to try to get the Digital Signature Standard replaced by RSA signatures for inclusion in key escrow FIPS due to its "virtual non-availability in commercial products," and noted that the US Govt. has free use of RSA sigs. Another noteworthy point is that NIST made clear that the key escrow FIPS should _not_ involve SECRET algorithms. The Workshop consisted of a discussion of goals and objectives by RayKammer (Deputy Director, NIST) and some initial thoughts on standardsdevelopment by Miles Smid (NIST). Here is the gist of the overheadslides: The Goals of the workshop were based on the August 17 announcement by theAdministration to allow for exportability of 64-bit software key escrowencryption, plans to allow Federal agencies to use Escrowed EncryptionStandards compliant hardware devices for data communications, and thedevelopment of a FIPS for key escrow, implementable in software. Thisescrow FIPS would be used by Federal agencies in conjunction withFIPS-approved encryption techniques. This workshop was held to help begin the FIPS development. The workshop goals included Providing input to the govt. on drafting a software key escrow encryption standard; Helping govt. to identify additional policy and technical issues that need to be addressed and providing the govt. with thoughts on drafting and follow-up The FIPS process involves developing the draft FIPS, a 90 day comment period, then addressing comments, and then it goes to the Secretary of Commerce for signature, and becomes effective six months after the signature. The purpose of the New Escrow FIPS is to foster a wider use of escrow technology...this means: no requirement for SECRET algorithms, software and hardware implementations, and exportability. It also will provide a government validation of escrow systems meeting the standard...theoretically allowing for security, integrity, and availability. Threats examined included compromise (unauthorized disclosure of keys and data recovery), and denial of service (modification or loss of keys, use of bogus recovery fields, and improper system operation). The FIPS will provide common formats and procedures which will facilitate data recovery and lower cost. Applicability of the FIPS will include the US Govt. and contractors. Applications include both stored and transmitted data. Encryption algorithms must be FIPS approved. And finally desirable features include: auditing, configuration control, backup capability, and efficiency. The questions asked to the breakout groups included: Is a standard interface for the release of keys desirable? What documentation is required? How will operational procedures be developed? How will conformance be validated? Will security be evaluated? If so, under what criteria and by whom? How will configuration control be maintained? Are new FIPS-approved algorithms necessary? Should escrowing be built into the Public Key Infracstructure? Is a standard escrow system identification field needed? Is split knowledge required? Do systems which permit data to be encrypted for both storage and transmission need to provide for both kinds of escrow? Does the government require special features (2-hour access, continuous real-time decryption, etc.)? Back to Pat'sClipper II page.

Business Section, Page C2, September 16, 1995 After a brief August honeymoon, feuding has broken out again among theU.S. government, industry and civil liberty advocates trying to deviserules that would permit high-technology companies to more easily exportsophisticated technologies that scramble information. Yesterday, the various parties sat down in a day-long meeting to discuss thetechnology, which keeps information safe from eavesdroppers, but foundlittle common ground. Government officials tried to put a positive light onthe process, but several private sector people who attended said they felt"confused," and "burned" by the discussions. "This whole thinkg is like trying to find a way through a maze that none ofus have found a way through before," said Steve Walker, president of TrustedInformation Systems, an information security company in Brentwood, Maryland."Everybody would like everything, and we're all going to have to give upsomething." Both industry and government thought they saw possible grounds forcompromise in August, when Clinton administration officials said they werewilling to let companies export sohpisticated encryption technologies thatprovided some private organizations would hold onto a spare key forunlocking scrambled information. That way if law enforcement officials hadthe proper court authorization, they could get a peek at otherwise lockedinformation. But sparkls began to fly a few weeks later when the administration met withindustry and others to explore precisely how such a policy would work. Forexample, although the new policies would let companies export more complexencryption technology than current law permits, businesses began worryingthat the most sophisticated techniques would still be out of bounds. Others worried about who would hold the spare keys. Since U.S. lawenforcement agencies want to be able to reach the keys, some felt thgeyshould in most cases be held in the United States unless the federalgovernment had struck a deal with its foreign counterparts that wouldenable, say, the FBI to obtain spare keys stored elsewhere on short notice. "There is not going to be an export market fo products" that require thatthe spare key be left in the United States," said David Sobel of theElectronic Privacy Information Center, an electronic privacy advocacy group.As long as foreign companies can sell products unencumbered by the spare-keyrequirement, "ours won't be competitive," he asserted. Clint Brooks, advisor to the director of the National Security Agency,countered that there were few "facts" that demonstrated that U.S. companieswoule lose sales if they could export the kind of encryption technology thatthe government was proposing to permit. "We just need to find out," he said,in a telephone interview. Others attending yesterday's meeting felt that there were too many groupstrying to tug the emerging policy from very different concerns. "There's thegovernment wanting to have seccure messages ... domestic security issues andespionage issues...[as well as]...industry coming in with its agenda ofselling products overseas. Oh, its going to be hard," said Jeff Rulifson atechnology director for Sun Microsystems, Inc. Mountain View, Calif. Government officials say they hope to draft a new set of proposals duringthe next few weeks and circulate them for another round olf comments. In themeantime, at least two industry groups are scrambling to draft their ownversions of an encryption policy. Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

This really needs a hypertext media. I'll build one for html page. Pleasebear with me on this, pure ASCII mail version.This is a write-up of stuff I left out of the summary.I'll merge them together on my nistpage, probably Friday.You've already seen the short write up. There is a fair amount of information on the NIST web server. Use url: http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/ As David Lesher noted, one of the most significant things was obvious inthe parking lot. Unlike September's meeting, this time it was empty.Inside the hall, it was obvious that no one came. It was packed inSeptember, and now, entire rows were empty. I'm bad at guessing numbers,but its easy to guess that only 1/3 as many people showed. Maybe less. >The meeting was hosted by Ed Roback of NIST, The meeting was in general a repeat of September's meeting, and similarmeetings that have been going on for years. Both sides talk past eachother. I think this has degenerated into a parallel with the abortiondebate. There is no common ground. >He said that they have studied the encryption that is supposed to be widely available on the Internet.>He said that viewed by crypto experts, not much is very good. He mentioned "two incidents" where>Netscape had weak implementations. He feels that companies will not trust software over the 'net. that>they "want the US Government to say that 'this is good enough'." I assume that the "two incidents" don't count breaking RC4-40. I can'tremember two Netscape security incidents, unless he means to count RJC'sbuffer overflow, all I can remember is Ian's key generation problem. >Clint Brooks, of NSA, then went over the revised criteria. He claimed that they>were surprised at the industry concern over "one product" for worldwide markets. He stated that they were addressing "not domestic policy, per se, but wekeep wrapping around" because of the 'one product' issue. The criteria are on the NIST page,url: http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/criteria.txt They handed out a guide to the changes in the criteria between Septemberand now. This is available from NIST as url:http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/bground.html Here is a portion of it: Old Criterion 1. Moved to #7; Old Criterion 2. Moved to #8; Old Criterion 3. Split into #1 and #2 Old Criterion 5. Moved to #10 Old Criterion 6. Moved to #9; Old Criterion 7. Moved to #5; Old Criterion 8. Moved to #6; Old Criterion 9. Deleted. Old Criterion 10. Moved to #3; Only in Washington. Oh yeah, they also clarified a lot of the wording. Ideas that I thought important enough to make notes of concerning thecriteria: These criteria do not address either hardware nor non-escrow encryption.Export controls of these are not changed, they can be exported with thecurrent procedures. Brooks said that these rules are not applicable to the protection ofinternal data for US corporations, even for overseas locations of US firms.He said that getting permission to export for _internal corporate use_ iseasy, if it is to protect corporate secrets and for internal communication.I took this to mean that a multi-national, US-based corporatgon can get apermit for ViaCrypt and export it for their own use. [later in the day,some people mentioned that this isn't nearly as easy as Brooks claimed.] He said that the intent in the new wording is flexibility. They don't wantto prescribe implementation details, he wants industry to invent whatsells. He specifically stated that the meetings were not about settingstandards. This caused at least a fair amount of confusion, probably due tothe fact that NIST used to be called National Bureau of Standards, and NBSset standards all the time. For example, a couple of folks were interestedin interoperability, say between a Netscape encryption system and one madeby, say, Microsoft. This meeting did not address this level ofinteroperability. about #2, "The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall beinoperable until the key(s) is escrowed in accordance with #3." Brooks saidthat the intent was to allow vendors to make a single product that doesn'tactivate the key-escrow function if not needed. The idea was that when thekeys are escrowed, the encryption engine would be activated. He also saidthat "manufacturers may not want to be in the key escrow business" andwould therefore want to ship products that could be activated by a thirdparty escrow agent. While talking about #3, "3. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions' key(s) shall be escrowed with escrow agent(s) certified by the U.S. Government, or certified by foreign governments with which the U.S. Government has formal agreements consistent with U.S. law enforcement and national security requirements." He stated that this does not preclude the use of "other agents." Thisbecame a major issue throughout the day. Ken Mendelson, staff attorney atTIS, asked (roughly) "Under what authority does the US Government grantcertification to agents?" The response was a run around. Another hot issuewas whether you can "hold your own keys" rather than using a third party.Seems that the corporate users are arguing that they want to hold their ownkeys, and the government reacted to that favorably (not unfavorably?).[Later in the day, Geoff Greiveldinger was asked if US citizens have theright to hold their own keys. Geoff was forced to admit that, "yes, you canhold your own keys"] #5, "5. The product's key escrow feature shall allow access to the key(s) needed to decrypt the product's ciphertext regardless of whether the product generated or received the ciphertext." Contains a significant change that was not discussed in September. It meansthat having the key for either end is sufficient. Brooks conceded that thiswas a big change, but claimed it was needed. The claim that one-endedsurveillance is easier is most likely true. It clearly is easier if oneend is US based and using GAK and the other is foreign where there isrespect for civil liberties. He even claimed that it made the system less intrusive: His argument wasroughly: Lets say they are snooping on me. With one-ended, they can read all of mymessages, to and from, without needing the keys of my correspondents. (letspick Geoff G. as an arbitrary correspondent) With two ended, they'd have toget both my key and Geoff's, and then they could read all of the messagesGeoff gets or sends. I said it was _their_ argument. Seems to me to be groundless, unless theygot the keys of everyone in the chain, all of the folks that I talk to, allof the folks that everyone I talk to, etc. on "7. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall use an unclassified encryption algorithm with a key length not to exceed sixty-four (64) bits." This is really aimed at session keys, or at least non-RSA keys. I suggestedthat they really needed some wording that make it clear. >He said that the 64-bit key limit is not meant to restrict RSA keys to>64-bits, but rather to restrict the session keys that are encrypted using>RSA. Unspoken was the assumption that the 2000 bit RSA secret key would have to be escrowed. on "8. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall not provide the feature of multiple encryption (e.g., triple- DES)." He pointed out that the wording used to say "prevent" and now just says"not provide". He acknowledged that "prevent" was impossible. on "9. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall interoperate only with key escrow cryptographic functions in products that meet these criteria, and shall not interoperate with the cryptographic functions of a product whose key escrow encryption function has been altered, bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered inoperative." Brooks said that this was intended to allow multiple modes, such ascompatibility with other encryption schemes. Of course, he said, the othermodes are subject to export restrictions. Somewhere in the discussion, Ed Appel took over for Brooks. Appel is"Director of Counter Intelligence Programs, National Security Council, TheWhite House" He was introduced as FBI. >There were some interesting (and bad IMHO) implications of interoperability.I'll cover them more in the next section Back to Pat's page on the December 5 NIST Clipper 2 meeting.

Here are myimpressions. In theory, NSA/NIST scheduled it to seek consensus from industry onhow to set up a Gov't Access to Keys (hereafter GAK) program they'dbe happy with. The bait was, NSA would allow export of same. The rub was, NSA attempted to set all the ground rules beforestarting. They had ten conditions any proposal had to meet.(http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/criteria.txt) With the rules available on-line, I'll not duplicate them all. But #1 is roughly: unclassified algorithm NTE 64 bits. and #10: Only key agents sanctioned by USG. Sanctioning by formal agreements "consistent with US law enforcement and National Security requirements." The conference was attended by I'd guess 150 Industry Bigwigs. LOTSof expensive suits ;-}. There were also more declared NSA types thanI'd ever seen before anywhere outside the Fort. Specific names I saw:(and no, I can't spell...) 	Win Diffe of Sun	D. Denning	Stuart Baker, late of NSA	Lance Hoffman of GWU	Carl Ellison of TIS	Edward Scheidt of TECSEC It opened with speeches by Ed Roback & Ray Kammer of NIST. The meatstarted with Michael Nelson of the White House. He attempted tojustify the GAK policies but did not appear to make any converts. Hemade (IMHO) denigrating remarks about trusting ~"code from the 'Net'with your secrets" but evaded questions about why anyone would trustkeys given to other governments... (Prevailing throughout the conference was a dichotomy. The officialjustification for the conference was "export use" but when questionsarose the specter of the 4 Horsemen of the Net-Apocalypse came upagain and again.) Then the meeting broke up into working groups. Each group discussedsome subset of the 10 rules then reported back to the whole. Weactually did this three times. Intermixed with this were variouspresentations. (See the www site.) At best, the working groups came back with no suggestions; atworst they returned in open revolt. The end result was a parsec wide gap between industry & NSA.Seemingly EVERY speaker the second day prefaced his/her remarks withsome form of "Do not assume our presence here is an endorsement,because it is NOT.." The Merrill-Lynch VP representing thesecurities industry association saw nothing to take back to hismembers. But it was Robert Holleyman, President of the Business SoftwareAlliance who drew the biggest standing ovation. (Read his paper on the WWW site.) His closing sentence seemed to say it all: Instead of paving the roads, the Administration has leftin place roadblocks on the Information Highway.

Scheidt, CEO &    Dr. Jon L. Roberts, President   TECSEC, Incorporated   [No date]   Introduction   During the past few years a debate has been raging around   the conflict between the rights of an individual to privacy   in information to foster its competitiveness and the   Government's need to access information for national   security and law enforcement purposes. At the heart of the   debate is the difficulty in arriving at a position whereby   a robust implementation of an encryption process can be   accomplished that protects sensitive private or industrial   data yet insures that the government can have access to   information if that information is part of a criminal   conspiracy or enterprise, or other action hostile to the   United States.   The U. S. Government initially tendered a cryptographic   scheme known as the Clipper Escrow Key management plan.   Using communication encryption technology, the government   wanted to mandate an encryption process for which it   maintained the key used for the decrypting of information   transiting any communications path. This key would be split   and distributed to escrow agents. The split key would have   to be combined if the government were to use the key to   decrypt and monitor criminal or other such activities. That   methodology met with howls of protest from much of U.S.   society (industry and private) due to a certain mistrust of   the government and its handling of private information (for   example, various IRS scandals). The debate has shifted from   the technical solution provided by the Clipper initiative   to alternate methods that define key escrow in terms of a   commercial or private entity.   A NIST-sponsored key escrow meeting was held on August 17,   1995 to listen to the government's proposal to work towards   a solution which industry and the international community   would accept and which would provide needed security to   private information. The meeting was a positive step   towards resolving the conflicting issues surrounding   cryptography. The government's proposal to extend the key   length of any cryptographic algorithm used to 64 bits to   enable export of cryptographic products more readily is a   small step towards industry's desire for "good"   cryptography. As a result, the government has set the stage   to extend cryptography into the broader international field   of electronic commerce. Privacy is still an issue and must   be included in the resultant key escrow solution.   Since the very onset ofthe debate TECSEC has espoused   private key escrow as the only method that individuals,   industry and the international community would accept for   cryptography. A split key method has been developed that   could satisfy many of the issues. The technology is called   Constructive Key Management ("CKM"), the resultant product   using CKM is called VEIL. VEIL is a software key management   design that utilizes multiple key splits with labels as   cryptographic triggers. It offers complete administrative   control of the key, and it includes an inherent method to   construct the key used for encrypting a file or database   that results in a fixed header and audit information. By   defining the roles of the escrow agent as a mix between   government and private as necessarv VEIL can be applied to   solve the private key escrow question   The Internet: A Paradox for Information Flow and   Information Control   At the heart of the escrow debate lies the philosophical   goal of competition. Economic competition on an   international electronic information highway such as the   Internet can only be fostered with a judicious balance   among the free flow of information, the respect for the   privacy of selected information, and the legitimate   requirements of law enforcement and national security   concerns.   The information highway of the Internet is already handling   large amounts of critical data where privacy is becoming a   more visible issue. Access to presidents, universities,   electronic commerce, government databases -- all of these   activities are available on today's Internet. While   government, industry and individuals want equal access to   the Intemet, they do not necessarily want equal access to   all the data that is flowing over the Internet ...   especially if it is their own!   Industry has always had a concern for keeping valuable   information of all types (corporate, healthcare, personnel)   safe from increasingly sophisticated curious hackers and   those with more malevolent objectives. Data security and   privacy are big businesses for both U. S. industries and   our foreign competitors. The U. S. security industry, like   industry in general, must have an environment where it can   compete overseas. Some foreign obstacles to this   competition are bad enough, but must we have additional   obstacles in the name of restrictive key escrow policies?   The compromise lies in defining a privately managed key   escrow scheme in which the governrnent can participate and   share in its administration and control, but only when   absolutely necessary.   Key escrow and encryption offer a methodology to achieving   privacy on the Internet by capitalizing on trends in   information processing and protection. Traditionally,   communications security technology has been concerned with   the protection of the mechanics of information processing   and not with protecting the information itself. Thus the   emphasis has been concerned with protecting the channels of   communications. If the security paradigm is moved to file   management and protection, a new methodology to protect   information emerges that can shift the protection of   information to the user of that information and away from   the manager of the means of communicating that information.   Since the nature of file management and the encryption   process necessitates the retention of keys to recover prior   encrypted files, the user of the information would be   responsible for protecting that information: hence, private   escrow key management.   The Private Key Escrow Process   There are different approaches to private key escrow that   need to be addressed. Of importance is that the individual   or the company must have confidence that they are in   control of the release of their information. Proprietary   data can determine a company' s competitiveness. It should   not simply be available to third parties. Key escrow agent   responsibility may be administered through the company or   through a third party. Liability issues and confidence will   dictate the extent to which third party agents are used.   One method to private key escrow is where the company   maintains the keys in a split form and the government has   access through the judicial process. The key escrow agent   is the company. (In some current banking implementations   the keys are split between two senior bank officials to   ensure that no one person has total access. The keys are   reassembled when needed.) The government's access to the   keys and the protected information is through regulation   and legislation that are enforced through the judicial   process. No one would need to turn over their keys to   encrypted files without a showing of probable cause as is   now done to obtain subpoenas. Failure to comply with a   subpoena could result in fines or other penalties. How long   key splits are maintained may be limited to a period of how   long the file is retained. It should be pointed out that   this form of key escrow does not offer the government any   technical means to access encrypted information without the   company's participation.   A second method of private key escrow could include an   additional key split for the government's use. The scenario   becomes key splits for the company and a key split for the   government. To reconstruct the key used for encrypting the   information mathematically could remain rigorous but now   the government would retain one of the splits. The   government key split could be fixed, whereas, the company's   key splits could be dynamic. Of course other variations are   possible on the mix of key splits. An additional key split   could be reserved for a foreign government's use and only   known to them. In the latter scenario key splits would be   administered by the U. S. government, a local government   authority, and the company. Administering the process can   be streamlined though a hierarchical key management scheme.   The government would still have to exercise its authority   through the judicial process.   The costs of key escrow could be assumed by the company if   the company is responsible for the key splits. The more the   government wants to administer the key escrow process, the   more the company would want to shift the costs of the   process to the government   What if the Private Key Escrow Process Is Not Used?   If the governrnent elects to accept another method to key   escrow other than a private form, there will be no domestic   U.S. solution to cryptography. The individual or industry   must believe they have control over their information and   have trust in the encryption process. If that trust does   not exist, industry will be reluctant to get involved.   A consequence of such policy will be that the import of   cryptographic products will increase for non-escrow   techniques since the government currently does not regulate   imports. It might be possible for the government to   administer import control under the current Department of   State regulations for cryptography.   Other actions that could happen include:   --   Jobs in the cryptographic field are lost to off shore        industries.   --   U.S. Ieadership in cryptography will be lost.   --   U.S. industries would be vulnerable to outside        intelligence activities through foreign product trap        doors.   --   U.S. international businesses will be forced to use        non-U. S. technology.   Private Escrow Key Management: A Method   Constructive Key Management (CKM) offers a technology that   capitalizes on combining key splits, a label process based   on cryptographic triggers which associates the key splits   to the inforrnation processes, and a three step process for   creating and distributing the key splits. A Label Maker   begins the process for creating the labels and their   respective key splits, a Key Disk Maker identifies the   labels, key splits, access authority to the individual   including read/write authority and stores that resultant   data on a token (a floppy disk), and a Workstation Setup is   offered that can limit what algorithms are present at a   workstation (algorithrns and labels can be used to separate   data within a three dimensional organizational array). In   the case of VEIL, the user is given a floppy disk to   encrypt and decrypt files that an administrator authorizes   based on organizational structure and procedures. The key   management process can be viewed as a house key management   process -- the physical key is made with notches that only   work with your home's lock, can be keyed to open only one   lock or many, shared with only those who you would want   access to your home, and can be readily replaced at the   locksmith. This variation on the older technology of crypto   ignition key management where key splits were the   predominant feature, facilitates the key handling process   and makes the user part of that process. VEIL is an   implementation of the CKM technology that includes   application program interface capabilities, multiple   algorithm management, and token management. Version 2.0   uses a floppy disk for a token. The algorithm(s) are bound   to the key escrow prograrn. An export version with single   DES (Data Encryption Standard) has been approved for   Canada, England, and Australia (governments).   Private Escrow Key Management: Conclusion   Constructive Key Management is one encryption methodology   of probably several that can meet the intent of key escrow.   Defining the role of specific key splits can expand or   minimize government's involvement. The technology is   flexible. A demonstrable product, VEIL, is available.   With the advent of increased usage on the Internet with   cryptographic products, the government will need to wrestle   with the more difficult situation of controlling free   access to encryption products. In short, how does the   government extend its current munitions control over   encryption products to the Internet? Already, encryption   products well beyond those currently sanctioned through   export regulation are available, from the U.S., over the   Internet. The desired balance is the realization of   encryption as a possible weapon and encryption as a vehicle   for fostering economic competitiveness   The debate concludes with the question, Who is going to   decide how the privacy of information is protected? The   resultant answer has far reaching impact on the economic   competitiveness of U.S. commerce.   [End] B�Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

On the same date,the September 6-7 key escrow issues meeting at NIST wasalso announced.  The two principal topics at the meetingwill be:  discussion of issues of exportability of 64-bitsoftware key escrow encryption and 2) desirablecharacteristics for key escrow agents.In order to help make most productive use of the limitedtime available at the upcoming meeting and to betterfocus deliberation, the following criteria are beingdistributed for discussion purposes.  Since it isimportant that final criteria be clear, straightforward,consistent, and implementable, please review these draftcriteria and be prepared to discuss how they may berefined and made more specific.Draft Export Criteria for Software Key Escrow EncryptionSoftware key escrow encryption products meeting thefollowing criteria will be granted special exportlicensing treatment similar to that afforded othermass-market software products with encryption.1.   The product will use an unclassified encryption     algorithm (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to     exceed 64 bits.2.   The product shall be designed to prevent multiple      encryption (e.g., triple-DES).3.   The key required to decrypt each message or file     shall be accessible through a key escrow mechanism     in the product, and such keys will be escrowed     during manufacture in accordance with #10.  If such     keys are not escrowed during manufacture, the     product shall be inoperable until the key is     escrowed in accordance with #10.4.   The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to     include with each encrypted message or file, in a     format accessible by authorized entities, the     identity of the key escrow agent(s), and     information sufficient for the escrow agent(s) to     identify the key or key components required to     decrypt that message.5.   The product shall be resistant to any alteration     that would disable or circumvent the key escrow     mechanism, to include being designed so that the     key escrow mechanism cannot be disabled by a static     patch, (i.e., the replacement of a block of code by     a modified block).6.   The product shall not decrypt messages or files     encrypted by non-escrowed products, including     products whose key escrow mechanisms have been     altered or disabled.7.   The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's     encrypted information regardless of whether that     user is the sender or the intended recipient of the     encrypted information.8.   The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated     involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery     of multiple decryption keys during the period of     authorized access.9.   In the event any such product is or may be     available in the United States, each production     copy of the software shall either have a unique key     required for decrypting messages or files that is     escrowed in accordance with #10, or have the     capability for its escrow mechanism to be rekeyed     and any new key to be escrowed in accordance with     #10.10.  The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only     with escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government     or by foreign governments with which the U.S.     Government has formal agreements consistent with     U.S. law enforcement and national security     requirements.Note: Software products incorporating additionalencryption methods other than key escrow encryptionmethods will be evaluated for export on the basis of eachencryption method included, as is already the case withexisting products. Accordingly, these criteria apply onlyto the key escrow encryption method incorporated by asoftware product, and not to other non-escrowedencryption methods it may incorporate.  For instance,non-escrowed encryption using a key length of 40 bitsor less will continue to be exportable under existingexport regulations.- - -Please also review discussion paper #1 (distributedearlier), which raises a number of issues involvingexportability criteria and how exportable products couldbe designed.  Discussion paper #2 (also previouslydistributed) presents questions involving key escrowagents.Note:  These issues will be discussed at the Key EscrowIssues Meeting to be held September 6-7, 1995 (9:00 a.m.- 5:00 p.m.) at the National Institute of Standards andTechnology (Gaithersburg, Maryland).

Under the proposal,products will be reviewed to verify that they satisfy thecriteria and, if so, they will be transferred to the CommodityControl List administered by the Department of Commerce where theproducts can be exported under a general license (in much thesame way that 40-bit RC2/RC4 encryption is licensed today).  We are working toward creating broadly stated criteria that arein the nature of performance specifications.  To meet thesecriteria, encryption products will need to implement key escrowmechanisms that cannot be readily altered or bypassed so as todefeat the purposes of key escrowing.  The criteria, when finalized and published, will state theobjectives, but not the exact technical method(s), by which thoseobjectives are satisfied.  This is to provide software publishersthe flexibility to design methods for meeting our statedobjectives in a manner that is compatible with the design oftheir products.  There are, therefore, a number of questions wemust work together to answer in order to draft effectivecriteria.  These questions are:  *    Avoiding multiple encryption -- How can the product be     designed so as to prevent doubling (or tripling, etc.) the     key space of the algorithm? *    Disabling the key escrow mechanism -- How can products be     made resistant to alteration that would disable or     circumvent the key escrow mechanism?  How can the "static     patch" problem be avoided?  How can this be tested?*    Access to escrow information -- What mechanisms must be     designed into encryption products to allow authorized access     to escrowed keys?  This likely includes the identity of the     key escrow agent(s) and a serial number for the key escrow     agent to use to identify the key(s)/component(s) necessary     to decrypt the message.  What other information will be     necessary to be provided to the escrow agent to identify the     necessary key(s)/component(s)?  Are there other comparable     viable approaches?*    Non-escrowed use -- How can products be made so that they do     not function with non-escrowed products (or tampered     escrowed products)?  How can this be tested?*    Limiting surveillance -- How can products be designed so     that information both sent and received by the user can be     decrypted without release of keys of other users?*    Practical Key Access -- How can mechanisms be designed so     that repeated involvement of escrow agents is not required     for decryption for multiple files/messages during the     specified access period?*    Assurance that keys are escrowed -- How can it be assured     that key escrow products are indeed satisfactorily escrowed?     For example, products could be required to be escrowed at     time of manufacture or be made inoperable until properly     escrowed.*    Ability to re-escrow keys -- How can products be designed so     that new keys can be escrowed at the user's discretion with     a U.S. Government approved escrow agent?*    Certified escrow agents -- Can products be designed so that     only escrow agents certified by the U.S. government     (domestic, or under suitable arrangements, foreign) are     utilized?  What should be the criteria for an acceptable     U.S. escrow agent?                          --------------With your input, we are hopeful that this effort will lead todefinitive criteria, which will facilitate the development ofexportable products and help minimize the time required to obtainexport licenses.  The Administration seeks to finalize suchcriteria and make formal conforming modifications to the exportregulations before the end of 1995.  Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

Thebreakout session was held at approximately 1:30 PM, on September 6, 1995. Groups c1 and c2 were small and were combined into one. The groupdiscussed criterias 5 and 6 of Topic 3.They are short enough to reproduce here. 5. The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be disabled by a static patch, (i.e., the replacement of a block of code by a modified block). 6. The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted by non-escrowed products, including products whose key escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled. After I commented that the person writing the notes has the ability todetirmine what was said, the folks from NSA and NIS&T asked me to take the notes. I should insert the standard disclaimer here: just because I'mtaking notes in the breakout session, don't assume that I'm endorsingthe concepts being discussed. In the middle of this discussion, a government-generated, but anonymnouspaper was distributed. It had "Example Suggested Solutions." It suggestedthat source code not be available for products suitable for export. It alsosuggested other ideas, such as storing a checksum/hash and having thesystem "check the cryptographic code several times during its use." There was a strong reaction against these suggestions, not because they werebad ideas, but because the paper was delivered with no prior publication.This precluded any planned response to its ideas. There was a fair amount of discussion as to what the criteria meant.The government's wording is bureacratic and wordy at best, andopen to too much subjective interpretation. There was a strong desire for a crisply worded criteria. This was to allow the goverment evaluators toeasily make decisions in the approval process without requiring subjectiveevaluations. It also allows vendors to set sharp-edged criteria fortheir developers and engineers to use while developing products. The group reworded #5 to say "want to Trust the Product." This means that it is untampered, works as expected, etc. We then hashed out ways to know this. The list ended up looking like: is available only as object code contains some "hash" function to check for modifications contains some unique hash, with uniqueness based upon something like "site," "per copy" or "per release" Contains policies against modification, such as liscense language against decompilation. OS-related security, such as runs "protected mode" instead of as a wild DOS program. Representatives of the software vendors objected strongly against "per copy" identifiers,saying it would add two orders of magnitude worth of problems to manufacturing. The items on the list were not "must have all of these" rather it wasa pick-and-chose menu. We expected exportable products to have some combination of these, not all of them. We also required that the standard allow flexibilityfor technical innovation to keep up with the evolving state of the art. I pointed out that some of the goals that we just listed are notcompletely realistic with the current state of the art. For example, thedefinition of "object code" is quite fluid with modern super-scalerCPUs that reinterpret instructions and convert them on thefly from one format to another. Similarly, many modern Object Orientedlanguages blur the distinctions between source and executable. Still otherlanguages typically are shipped with source code to everything,and don't really have a concept of "object code." The discussion of #6 was more lively. We took a long time figuring out whatit said. For instance, could ViaCrypt sell a product that was compatiblewith PGP 2.6.2 (non-escrowed) that also worked with the new escrowedciphers? It seems to me, and a lot of other folks there, that such a productwould be non-exportable. We tried to invent a rewording of Criteria #6 that said, clearly, whatwe thought the Government wanted it to say. The result was: The product shall check for the presence of properly constructedescrow field (information) prior to decryption of any message. If thefield is missing or improperly formed, the product will not decrypt the message. Equivalent approaches are acceptable. After a lot of discussion, we decide that our "improved" wording was notthat much better. We tried again. We simplified the criteria to: "right products won't talk to wrong products."with "right products" meaning those that are exportable, and wrong productsbeing those that aren't, or are hacked, or ... We then talked about modifying it to say: "right products won't talk to wrong products or anything else."The group thought that this seemed to be closer to what the LEA (law enforcement agencies) community wanted. It was definitely not what the commercial software vendors wanted. We then developed "goals" including: 1. One version for sale worldwide 2. Allow development in the US 3. Domestic Law Enforcement Agencies want Escrowed (I almost wrote GAK :-) 4. Must interoperate with everything 5. Receiver can only decrypt if escrow agencies can decrypt. This leads to a bunch of issues and observations, including: First Issue (A) Can goals 1, 2, and 4 be met simultaneously? No one could argue that they could be met. Goal 4 was required to allow the product to have "sales attractiveness." It was the consensus thatsales attractiveness meant that it had to interoperate with existing standards.This seemed to require that the software be developed in a country,such as Isreal or Germany, that understands the needs of the businesscommunity. There was a suggestion of a "friendly man-in-the-middle" who wouldreceive an escrowed conversation, and strip off the escrowed encryption parts, and reencrypt it, and retransmit it to a non-escrowed user. This "friend" is only friendly to parties that want to destroy the effectiveness of key escrowed encryption. I guess this means that friendship is relative.This concern leads to: Second Issue (B) Can we prohibit a friendly MITM? We could not invent a solution. It appeared to the group that anytechnical solution was suseptible to this "attack." It was notclear how important this issue is to the LEA community. The last and biggest issue was: Third Issue (C). Startup compatibility. No one will buy products unless they havesales attractiveness. This means compatibility with existing systems.Yet the government's criteria #6 seems to say that approved products must refusebackwards compatibility. This was labeled a "non starter" by the group. Interoperability wasdeclared a requirement. The consensus was that companies can develop a substantial competitiveadvantage by developing off-shore and offering both escrowed encryptionand compatibility with existing systems. There was a discussion of grandfathering in some technologies.This was to help interoperability. The conversation became fuzzy,Grandfather technologies included DES, 3-DES, IDEA, and long key RC4.There is a clear conflict here. DES and triple-DES are commonly used today in commercial (although not exportable) systems. IDEA and long key RC4 aregaining acceptance. All four of these are clearly candidates forinteroperability. One key idea was that it may make sense to allow software that encrypts withescrowed keys, but can also decrypt with any algorithm. This allows the LEA'sto access outgoing messages, while allowing interoperability. The discussions frequently wandered to discuss the language of the criteria.The wording was considered simultaneously too subjective and impractical.For example, we considered the phrase "tamper resistant" to be preferable to the original "prevent tampering," because it is impossible to absolutlyprevent modification to software. The issue of interoperability was raised repeatedly. It is critical that exportable products interoperate with other,existing export products. The last issue in the session was that the length of the key, 64-bits,was defined in criteria #1. There was no discussion at the conference onthis criteria. It seems that the NIS&T and NSA staff believe thatthis is a closed topic. The people in the session did not agree. Theyfelt that 64-bits was not enough. Once the breakout session was over, the entire conference met together, and the "reporter" from each session reported their comments and findings. All breakout sessions had suggested changes. The group that discussedcriteria #9 recommended removing it. The group that discussed criteria #2 (no multiple encryption) reported that industry was working on a general solution to the problem of key recovery, and that their solution would probably appear as quickly without the government's "help." Several groups identified that there are at least two separate problem domains: communications and data storage. Communications typically is short term, and has unique keys for each session. Data storage has far fewer keys that are usedfor long periods. Several speakers suggested that while communicationskeys were not suited to be escrowed, there was a large need forkey recovery for data storage. There was no response from the governmentrepresentatives to any of these points. One government speakerdid say that there would be a Federal key escrow standard, period. This last statement caused me to reflect on the value ofparticipating in the session. Pat Farrell's personal opinion I believe that there was a lot of talking, and very little listening at the meeting. What I heard the industry say was: there are two separate classes of encrypted data, communications and long term storage. There is a commercial need forkey recovery (key escrow) for long term storage. There is nocommercial need for key recovery for communications. Industry has no essential problem with cooperating withgovernment and LEA needs for key escrow, as long as itis acceptable to, and driven by, the market. Without interoperability with current defacto standards(e.g. strong algorithms, long keys, triple-DES, IDEA, etc.)the products will not succeed in the market. there is no such thing as a US Domestic market. There is one,worldwide market. If there are no restrictions on importing software, and seriousrestrictions on exporting it, industry will be driven offshore. What I head from the privacy and civil liberty advocates: Encrypted speach is free speach, protected under the Constitution. Attempts to regulate and restrict domestic use of strong encryption willresult in a loud, messy, and very public fight. This is not a technical debate, it is a political one, and shouldoccur in a political forum. Yet what I heard from the government folks was: These standards are voluntary. The LEA community wants and requires escrow of keys used for communications. The need for this was justified by a number of heart-tugging appeals to the emotions with unsubstantiatedclaims of rampant crime caused by Drug Dealers, pedophiles, and terroriststhat requires key escrow. that a standard would be set essentailly as proposed, without regard to the comments of industry, privacy advocates, or civil liberty advocates. It is clear to me that the groups were talking past each other. I believethat there are legitimate LEA concerns, and that industry wantsto be responsive to those concerns. I have not heard anycredible justification for and explanation of the LEA concerns. I have been following this debate since 1992, and have yetto see a emotion-free explanation as to why the LEAs are so adamantlyagainst cryptography. After years of honing their arguments, I'd expecta solid, fact-filled case from the LEAs.The public record fails to show any significant number ofinvestigations that have been hindered by criminal use of cryptography.Statements thatthese standards are voluntary and will stay voluntary are simplynot credible when the only justifications given are domestic exampleswith no more solid grounding than Time Magazine's cries that the Internetis being overrun with pornography. The LEAs need to tone down their rhetoricand base the discussion on facts if they want to he heard. I have described myself as a PhD student. I have a strong interest insecurity. I had a peer-reviewed paper published in the NationalComputer Security Conference (1992).To support my family while working on my PhD, I have a part-time job developing software.I work at a large (5000+ staff, $400 million yearly revenue) company.I can't speak for the company, but I can say what I see as an employee.We used to sell mainframe finiancial applications to banks, insurance firms,and large multinational companies. We can not longer sell mainframe software;our customers insist on client/server solutions. I have looked hard, and foundonly one solution to the security and authentication issues that are caused by client/server architectures. That solution is strong cryptography. The customers do not, yet, have the experience to understandthat they need strong encryption, at least as strong as Kerberos. They don't see it now, but they will soon. We willhave to provide security and authentication for our systems. Of concern with the topic of these export meetings, the company'sgrowth is in Europe. We compete today against European software firms. I havepersonal interests (I like living in Virginia) in being able to develop and sell software thatcompetes with the European developed code. They will not be restrictedto 64-bit, US escrowed keys. This is the market reality that my firm sees. The government is offering 64-bit encryption, including DES. Theyare sorely behind the times. While still in use, DES isconsidered too weak for serious consideration.Today, the standards for encryption are 2000 bit public key (RSA) forlong term keys, and 128-bit (IDEA) or 168-bit (3-DES) session keys.Industry says that session keys are not worth escrowing. Yet they aretoo long to be acceptable to the government. Simply stating that only64 bit keys are acceptable is not a realistic position for the LEAs to take if they want to claim that this is a credible conversation. Standardizing on weak encryption, that meets neither the needs of businessnor the privacy needs of citizens, based upon the weak justificationpresented to date by the LEAsis not appropriate for a free democratic society. I have tried to accurately report the discussions, with the hopethat the two or three sides can reach a common ground. I did not seeany progress during the breakout session, or at any other timeduring the two days.

Kammer, Deputy Director National Institute of   Standards and Technology   September 6-7, 1995   Perspective   1.   Last year, we held two workshops on key escrow issues.        A fundamental question was raised:          Can a software key escrow method be bound to an          encryption algorithm in a robust manner to permit          export of strong algorithms (e.g., DES)?   2.   On August 17, 1995, the Administration announced that        it would permit the export of software encryption with        64-bit key space if the key(s) required for decryption        were escrowed with approved escrow agents.   3.   Given parameters in #2, draft export criteria have        been developed. See Discussion paper #2. (Dr. Nelson        will review in next presentation.)   Goals and Objectives   During the course of this meeting, we would like to:   1)   understand industry reaction to the draft export        criteria; For example, are they clear,        straightforward, consistent and implementable?   2)   begin a dialog to finalize the criteria and establish        the procedural/regulatory changes in a timely manner;   3)   explain how the USG envisions the export process        working for these software products;   4)   listen to industry's concerns on issues requiring        attention so we can focus our activities to be as        responsive as possible;   5)   discuss issues involving desirable characteristics for        key escrow agents and approaches to developing and        implementing an approval process;                6)   provide industry the opportunity to express its        concerns on issues related to key escrow encryption   7)   identify areas for follow-up discussion / meetings.   Questions?   [End Kammer]----------   Draft Software Key Escrow Export Criteria   Michael Nelson   [White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]   presented to the:   Software Key Escrow Issues Meeting   National Institute of Standards and Technology   September 6-7, 1995   Historical Perspective   On July 20, 1994, Vice President Gore wrote to then Rep.   Maria Cantwell of establishing a goal:        of trying to develop a key escrow system that will        provide strong encryption, be acceptable to commercial        users worldwide, and address our national security        needs as well.   He also stated:        Such a key escrow system would be implementable in        software, firmware, hardware, or any combination        thereof, would not rely upon a classified algorithm,        would be voluntary, and would be exportable.   In 1994, two Key Escrow Alternatives meetings were held by   NIST to discuss alternatives to Clipper. Five key questions   were raised:   1.   Has NSA determined that there is no way of binding a        software key escrow method to an algorithm in a manner        that will be robust enough to permit export of strong        encryption (e.g., DES)?   2.   If NSA believes that software can be used effectively,        will they try to work with industry to define        acceptability criteria based upon the strength of the        algorithms to be used?   3.   Does NSA anticipate foreign governments allowing use        of U.S. controlled (read "escrowed") cryptography?        Specifically, does the NSA envision U.S. escrow of        keys for U.S.-originated cryptography used in other        countries?   4.   Can key escrow products be freely exported provided        that no algorithms are included, with the anticipation        that foreign users can insert their own algorithms?   5.   Provided that software solutions are acceptable, what        will the evaluation or approval process look like? Is        it a one-time review?   We believe that the draft export criteria address most, if   not all, of these questions.   Draft Export Criteria   for Software Key Escrow Encryption   Software key escrow encryption products meeting the   following criteria will be granted special export licensing   treatment similar to that afforded other mass-market   software products with encryption.   1.   The product will use an unclassified encryption        algorithm (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to        exceed 64 bits.   2.   The product shall be designed to prevent multiple        encryption (e.g., triple-DES).   3.   The key required to decrypt each message or file shall        be accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the        product, and such keys will be escrowed during        manufacture in accordance with #10. If such keys are        not escrowed during manufacture, the product shall be        inoperable until the key is escrowed in accordance        with #10.   4.   The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include        with each encrypted message or file, in a format        accessible by authorized entities, the identity of the        key escrow agent(s), and information sufficient for        the escrow agent(s) to identify the key or key        components required to decrypt that message.   5.   The product shall be resistant to any alteration that        would disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism,        to include being designed so that the key escrow        mechanism cannot be disabled by a static patch, (i.e.,        the replacement of a block of code by a modified        block).    6.   The product shall not decrypt messages or files        encrypted by non-escrowed products, including products        whose key escrow mechanisms have been altered or        disabled.   7.   The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's        encrypted information regardless of whether that user        is the sender or the intended recipient of the        encrypted information.   8.   The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated        involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of        multiple decryption keys during the period of        authorized access.   9.   In the event any such product is or may be available        in the United States, each production copy of the        software shall either have a unique key required for        decrypting messages or files that is escrowed in        accordance with #10, or have the capability for its        escrow mechanism to be rekeyed and any new key to be        escrowed in accordance with #10.   10.  The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only        with escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government or        by foreign governments with which the U.S. Government        has formal agreements consistent with U.S. law        enforcement and national security requirements.   *Note: Software products incorporating additional   encryption methods other than key escrow encryption methods   will be evaluated for export on the basis of each   encryption method included, as is already the case with   existing products. Accordingly, these criteria apply only   to the key escrow encryption method incorporated by a   software product, and not to other non-escrowed encryption   methods it may incorporate. For instance, non-escrowed   encryption using a key length of 40 bits or less will   continue to be exportable under existing export   regulations.*   Conclusions and Summary   1.   We welcome the opportunity to work with you to refine,        clarify and finalize the export criteria for 64-bit        software key escrow encryption.   2.   We also need your thoughts on desirable        characteristics for key escrow agents and what sort of        approval process should be established.   3.   We need to understand your priorities for government        activities to make all of this happen.   4.   As we move forward, let us not lose sight of our        concerns to provide strong encryption that meets users        needs and does not harm national security and law        enforcement   [End Nelson] Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

This is a list of helpful information for making a Windows NT computerbe a full member of the Internet community. Read the "site description" at Somarsoftware for info on how to Gateway to the Internet with NT NT security background John Piraino's guide for Connecting NT Workstationsto the 'net using PPP Software.com has a lot of NT software, including aFree BIND (DNS daemon) for NT An article about enabling NT's RAS tcp/ip routingIt tells you about regedt32 entries that you have to create. Here is some more information: After you configure your registry to enable packets from other sources and turn on IP routing, you must do 3 other things Partician your net into at least 2 subnets. You can do this from the TCP/IP configuration under the networks control panel. I'm using the subnet mask 255.255.255.128 Your RAS IP address must fall into a different subnet than your server's IP or workstations. RAS IP 152.160.184.254 (upper subnet *.*.*.128-255) Server IP 152.160.184.100 (lower subnet *.*.*.0-127) Workstation IP 152.160.184.10 (lower subnet *.*.*.0-127) Add static routes to your routing table for each workstation. Go to DOS prompt on the server and type route add (workstation IP) (server IP) You now should be able to ping your server with RAS running, and IP addresses outside your net.3. Set the DNS entry on your workstations to the DNS address of your ISP. I'm putting up a complete and detailed instructions on my Web page www.owenrudy.com, should be up in next couple of days.....If you have any other questions email me at ocreger@ic.net and still more: Next thing is to make sure, that the IP-Addres you use for RemoteAccess is always the same (you'll need it to specify the routings) At last you must tell all your Clients to use the NT-Machine as deault gateway and enter persistent routes on your NT-Machine for each Client. Example: let's say your RAS-IP-Address is 192.0.1.1 and the LAN-IP-Address of your Gateway is 192.0.2.1, your Clients have Addresses 192.0.2.2 etc. Enter the following Line for each Client: route -p 192.0.2.2 192.0.2.1 (don't forget the -p or you'll have to do it again after your next reboot) and this... And acutally your RAS connection will deliver you TWO IP addresses,one on the client and one on the server. My NT server has IP addressA1 on the NIC with gateway address G1. The RAS server give the clientsaddress C1, but it also keeps an address C2 for the RAS server. On theclient side I'm set up with Nic address A2, gateway empty (as to befilled by the RAS connection).I can set up a static route with the ROUTE command. I can route backfrom the server by entering C1 as destination address, and C2 as thegateway address. That way, NT routes all packets it can not address onthe local subnet mask to G1 except packets to C1. Those go via C2 toC1. Basically you tell NT to use a different gateway address for acertain IP. This gateway address over RAS seems to be the second RASip address (the one that the RAS server keeps) and not the RAS clientaddress. Means it seems to use C2 rather than C1. I'm not all the way there, but I'm pretty darn close to get RAS fullrouting to work. Hier my IP addresses: NT server 1.1.1.10 Gateway to the Internet on this LAN (ISDN via Pipeline 50) 1.1.1.1 RAS IPs 1.1.1.20-1.1.1.22 (Range set in RAS setup) NT client (on a different LAN) 1.1.2.10 NT client demands 1.1.1.22 as it's RAS IP address. gateway--------LAN-NT Server-RAS-----------RAS-NT server-LAN 1.1.1.1       1.1.1.10       1.1.1.20          1.1.1.22      1.1.2.10 As I said, I'm almost there.

We areanxious to work with you and other industryrepresentatives to facilitate development of exportablekey escrow encryption in software products. I lookforward to the workshop being an important step in thatprocess. I have attached a draft agenda for the two days. Ipropose that we spend the majority of our time discussinga set of export criteria. In order to move thatdiscussion along, a draft set of criteria is attached. The criteria state, in general terms, the government'sneeds with respect to exportable software, consistentwith its law enforcement and national securityrequirements. Since it is important that the finalcriteria be clear, straightforward, consistent, andimplementable, Mike Nelson of the Office of Science andTechnology Policy will spend a few minutes describingthese criteria on the first morning of the meeting. After that, we would like to hear your perspectives onthem and work with you to refine them. On the secondday, we plan to discuss the export licensing process forsuch products, and begin exploring characteristics ofacceptable key escrow agents. Again, thank you for your participation. I look forwardto seeing you there. Sincerely, / s / Raymond G. KammerDeputy Director Back to Pat's page on the December 5 NIST Clipper 2 meeting. Back to Pat'sClipper II page.

Denning   Sept. 5, 1995   1.   The product will use an unclassified encryption        algorithm (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to        exceed 64 bits. [No comment]   2.   The product shall be designed to prevent multiple        encryption (e.g., triple-DES). [No comment]   3.   The key required to decrypt each message or file shall        be accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the        product, and such keys will be escrowed during        manufacture in accordance with #10. If such keys are        not escrowed during manufacture, the product shall be        inoperable until the key is escrowed in accordance        with #10.        *Comment. The requirement as written suggests a        Clipper-like model where each product has its own        individual escrowed key. With some key escrow systems,        for example, TIS's CKE and Fortress's KISS, the keys        held in escrow are master keys shared by multiple        products/users. A product encrypts the session/file        key (or, in the case of KISS, the user's private key)        under this master key. The master key could be        pre-loaded into the product (e.g, as with KISS) or it        could be downloaded into the product during program        initialization (e.g., TIS). Further, we do not want to        prevent a product from operating at all prior to        escrow. As with the TIS or Banker's Trust (BT)        proposals, the product needs to operate in order to be        initialized with keys! All that's needed is to prevent        data encryption. Finally, the requirement as written        does not make it clear that the product in question is        the one that was used to encrypt the data (which,        strictly speaking, may be something other than a        message or file, e.g, an image object). The following        is a possible rewrite:          The key required to decrypt data that has been          encrypted by a product shall be accessible through          a key escrow mechanism in the product. A product          shall not encrypt data unless the key needed for          decryption has been escrowed in accordance with          #10.*   4.   The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include        with each encrypted message or file, in a format        accessible by authorized entities, the identity of the        key escrow agent(s), and information sufficient for        the escrow agent(s) to identify the key or key        components required to decrypt that message.        *Comment. It is not necessary to identify the escrow        agents as long as there is information that will        readily lead to their identity. For example, the BT        proposal identifies the user and the user's escrow        center. The escrow center has a record of the escrow        agents used by that user. As another possibility, a        product might be designed to always use a particular        escrow agent(s), so knowing the name of the product        would be sufficient to identify the agents (as in the        case of Clipper). Possible rewrite:          The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to          include with each encrypted message or file, in a          format accessible by authorized entities,          information that readily leads to the identity of          the key escrow agent(s), and information sufficient          for the escrow agent(s) to identify the key or key          components required to decrypt that message.*   5.   The product shall be resistant to any alteration that        would disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism,        to include being designed so that the key escrow        mechanism cannot be disabled by a static patch, (i.e.,        the replacement of a block of code by a modified        block).        *Comment. The product should also be resistant to        circumvention without alteration, for example, by        passing in special parameters. Possible rewrite:          The product shall be resistant to any use or          alteration that would disable or circumvent the key          escrow mechanism, to include being designed so that          the key escrow mechanism cannot be disabled by a          static patch (i.e., the replacement of a block of          code by a modified block).*   6.   The product shall not decrypt messages or files        encrypted by non-escrowed products, including products        whose key escrow mechanisms have been altered or        disabled.        *Comment. For generality, change to:          The product shall not decrypt data encrypted by          non-escrowed products, including products whose key          escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled.*   7.   The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's        encrypted information regardless of whether that user        is the sender or the intended recipient of the        encrypted inforrnation.        *Comment. Does it matter whose keys are used, i.e.,        sender's or receiver's? As worded, this would allow        for the use of either. If it can be either, then it        may be necessary to go to many escrow agents to        decrypt a subject's communications, for example, the        escrow agent for each person who sends a message to        the subject. They might be in foreign countries. If        the intent is to restrict it to the key of the subject        of an investigation, it might be reworded as:          The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's          encrypted information using only the keys          associated with the user regardless of whether that          user is the sender or the intended recipient of the          encrypted information.*   8.   The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated        involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of        multiple decryption keys during the period of        authorized access.        *Comment. What is meant by involvement? Participation        by individuals? What if the escrow agents provide an        automated way of obtaining keys after an initial        start-up (e.g., through a TIS data recovery center)?*   9.   In the event any such product is or may be available        in the United States, each production copy of the        software shall either have a unique key required for        decrypting messages or files that is escrowed in        accordance with #10, or have the capability for its        escrow mechanism to be rekeyed and any new key to be        escrowed in accordance with #10.        *Comment. Is the purpose of this to ensure that if a        key is compromised, all program copies are not        compromised with it -- thus, a single copy can be        tossed or an entire product line can be rekeyed?*   10.  The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only        with escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government or        by foreign governments with which the U.S. Government        has formal agreements consistent with U.S. law        enforcement and national security requirements. [No comment]   [End first section of comments]   Comments on Issues for Key Escrow Agents   *Comment. Where do entities such as the Bankers Trust   escrow center (which is involved in the escrow process and   is needed to find out what escrow agents to go to get keys)   or the Fortress KISS archive center (which performs an   auditing/archiving role) fit into this? They don't hold   keys, but their performance is critical to the system. It   would seem that any entity that is operationally involved   in key escrow should satisfy certain properties.*   1.   What kinds of organizations should be excluded from        consideration as approved key escrow agents? [NC]   2.   What sort of legal agreement between the government        and the key escrow agent is necessary to stipulate the        responsibilities of the agent? Should this include the        terms and conditions under which release of a key is        required? [NC]   3.   How will liability for unauthorized release of key be        handled? [NC]   4.   Should, for example, intentionally misreleasing or        destroying a key be criminalized? Should this include        other actions?        *Comment. It should be a criminal offense to:        a)  make a key available to someone knowing that that            person does not have lawful authority to use the            key,        b)  obtain or use a key without lawful authority,        c)  obstruct, impede, or prevent the use of keys when            there is lawful authority*   5.   How can the government's needs for confidentiality of        key release be handled? [NC]   6.   Should approval of key escrow agents be tied to a        public key infrastructure (for digital signatures and        other purposes)?        *Comment. Should use of the public key infrastructure        be conditioned on using key escrow encryption?*   7.   What procedures need to be developed for the storage        and safeguarding of keys? [NC]   8.   What are the acceptable performance criteria (e.g.,        around-the-clock availability, accessibility,        reliability, etc.) for approved key escrow agents? [NC]   9.   Under what circumstances will key escrow agents in        foreign countries be approved? [NC]   10.  What process will he used to approve escrow agents?        Costs/who pays?

He was involved in thepassage of the ECPA, among other things.  He's CIX's lawyer, and sentthis document to CIX (the Commercial Internet Exchange), which passedit on to its membership.        John Gilmore PIPER & MARBURY L.L.P. Memorandum To: Interested Parties From: Ron Plesser Date: September 11, 1995 Subject: NIST Key Escrow Encryption Meeting The National Institute of Standards and Technology on September 6 and 7held a meeting on issues regarding key escrow encryption, focusing onexport criteria for software and desirable characteristics for U.S. keyescrow agents. Ten draft software key escrow export criteria were putforth by NIST for consideration and possible revision (see below). Keyescrow encryption is the recent Administration proposal for analternative to Clipper Chip, which industry opposed. Key escrow would,in the Administration's view, allow the export of software with strongencryption. In summary, the government would permit the generallicensing of 64-bit-key encryption provided that it be manufacturedwith a key that would be maintained by independent escrow agents whowere certified by the U.S. government. Foreign escrow agents could beused where there was a bi-lateral agreement with the particular countryinvolved. NIST Deputy Director Ray Kammer provided an overview of the goals ofthe meeting, and said that NIST plans to issue a Federal Registernotice containing a "revised set of thoughts" in three weeks. Therewill be a 60-day comment period following publication of the revisedprinciples in the Federal Register. The NIST will then review thecomments received and determine whether there is enough consensus toproceed. There will be additional meetings on September 15, 1995 todiscuss the Federal government's requirements for its own informationprocessing standards for key escrow encryption. This meeting will takeplace at the Gaithersburg, Maryland Hilton Hotel from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00p.m. It was clear from the meeting, both in presentations and conversationduring breaks, that most computer systems and certainly those used bylarge entities will have key escrow systems for encryption. There waseven a person who spoke who said that they are doing this now. Manypeople at the meeting acknowledged that key escrow would be implementedat some point for domestic as well as for exported programs. The issueis who would hold the key. For example, could a company hold its ownkeys or could an independent agent be used? The people who create mass market software, however, still expressedsignificant opposition to key escrow. While the government went tosome length to express that this solution is neutral as to software orhardware, it has to be acknowledged that hardware-based systems areeasier to control. The subject that was not well discussed was encryption in relation tonetwork services and the internet. It was discussed in relation to theissues of interoperability and the ability to decrypt both sides of acommunication. The assumption that I and others had at the outset was that theAdministration had made progress in the last year in raising itselffrom the ashes of Clipper Chip. By the end of the meeting that was notaltogether clear. There will remain a great deal of controversysurrounding this issue. Congress is sure to get involved and it willget messier before it gets resolved. Administration Comments Mike Nelson, who is special assistant for information technology to theWhite House Office of Science and Technology Policy and co-chair of theinter-agency working group on encryption, provided a historicaloverview of the data encryption issue. He said that the proposed64-bit-key encryption is 17 million times stronger than the 40-bit-keyencryption currently allowed to be exported. Under the proposedpolicy, software with 64-bit-key encryption could be exported tofriendly countries under certain conditions, all of which require thata key to that encryption be available in the U.S. from an independentthird-party. Mr. Nelson stated that the new policy will open up newmarket opportunities for the U.S. computer software industry, and thatkey escrow has the potential to become a de facto global standard. TheAdministration policy for 40-bit-key encryption will continue as-is,and no keys will have to be escrowed for such systems. Mr. Nelson said that the government's main concern is that strongencryption products not be available in the mass market. In response to questioning, Mr. Nelson stated that the 64-bit-key limitis being imposed because the government is not certain that the keyescrow system will work. Once the system is up and running, longerkeys may be allowable. He said that the draft criteria are based onnational security needs, and that they were pushed as far as possibleto meet commercial needs. Mr. Nelson added that the Administration isdiscussing the possibility of federal legislation with Hill staff toavoid varying state laws on encryption. Industry Perspectives General reaction was mixed to the government's proposal. Most heavyindustrial and commercial users of encryption seemed accepting of theAdministration's position. To them this meant greater flexibility andwould mean that most larger systems could get export licenses for64-bit-key systems and this would expand the capacity to sell largersystems abroad. This position was exemplified by Trusted InformationSystems (TIS), representatives of which spoke several times. In apresentation, Peter Dinsmore of TIS offered restatements of thecriteria to make them more commercially viable, and a set of "criteriafor the criteria," which are as follows: 1) don't specify commercialcriteria, 2) don't exceed the minimum, 3) don't allow criteria creep,4) don't solve the dual-rogue problem, 5) don't over protect, and 6)use generic nomenclature. He recommended that criteria six and nine beremoved altogether, a view that was echoed by other participants. The mass market software industry and the public interest groups werevery opposed to the Administration proposal. They do not believe that64-bit key is sufficient, and they do not believe that anyone will buyU.S.-manufactured software with a key that is to be held by a thirdparty under at least some control by the government. There was a fairamount of confusion on the issue at the meeting, but it now seems clearthat the government would permit foreign escrow where there arebi-lateral agreements with friendly nations. In a presentation, Bob Holleyman of the Business Software Alliance criticized theAdministration's failure to "liberalize export controls on generallyavailable software employing non-key escrow encryption." Also, hestated that the Administration's proposal and the draft criteria"continue to reflect a misunderstanding of the market place and, ifimplemented in anything like their current form, will prevent keyescrow encryption from ever being commercially adopted." Mr.Holleyman recommended a number of features for a marketable system,including a variety of encryption algorithms using at least 64-bitkeys and user specification of a key holder. In addition, the representative of MCI strongly objected to theproposal as an incursion into the private sector and as an impedimentto the development of a strong information infrastructure. Encryptionguru Whit Diffie of Sun Micro Systems and others objected to theproposal. Danny Weitzner of the Center for Democracy and Technology said that CDTwas going to go to Congress and object to the implementation of thisproposal. They thought that it was a bad deal and the governmentshould not be placed in the position of directing standards andrequiring back doors into encryption systems. Discussion of Criteria Six, Seven and Eight Following the industry presentations, participants divided into groupsto discuss various criteria. The group that discussed criteria six,seven and eight made the following observations and recommendations. There seemed to be universal objection to criterion six. This wouldlimit the interoperability of systems. It effectively states thatexported 64-bit key cannot be used to decrypt messages that wereencrypted with a higher value. This would make it very difficult forU.S. companies to interact with foreign subsidiaries. The internetwould find great difficulty in connection with this criteria. Regarding criterion seven, concern was raised that in the context ofe-mail, it would be onerous to do key escrow for every transmission.Concern also was raised about maintaining the integrity of intellectualproperty in instances in which the escrow agent is in a foreigncountry. In effect, when one chooses an escrow center, one also isselecting a legal system. A request was made for a supplementaldocument explaining applicable existing laws. Concern was raised that all of the criteria are focused on the voicecommunication paradigm, rather than on the dynamic data communicationsenvironment. Laws also are focused on this paradigm, and law movesslowly whereas computer technology moves rapidly. In addition, thecriteria do not address varying international laws on issues such asprivacy. Companies will have to comply with the laws of the strictestcountries. Concern was raised that privacy considerations are not asapparent in the criteria as ease of access by law enforcementagencies. Also, innocent parties could be de-escrowed. In addition,it was emphasized that encryption must not interfere with use ofexisting software. Information was requested on two encryptionschemes, Banker's Trust and Fortress. It was recommended that the TIS restatement of criterion seven beadopted. This restatement is as follows: "The key escrow mechanismallows access to both sides of a simultaneous (i.e., two-way)communication with only access to the decrypting information from oneof the users." It also was recommended that for bi-directionalcommunications, both parties negotiate a common key and escrow it, andthat for one way communications, the sender select the escrow key. Regarding criterion eight, it was agreed that the technology issues,international issues, and privacy issues are the same as those forcriterion seven. It was noted that certain implementations wouldrequire escrowing of the session key, which is unrealistic. It wasagreed that with one court order, law enforcement agencies should havethe ability to decrypt a stream of messages. However, there must be atime limit on decryption. It was agreed that agents should be able toimplement an automated system. General Review/Comments on All Criteria Industry and government representatives met less formally with theobjective of reviewing each of the criteria and attempting to reconciledifferences. However, this did not occur; instead, broader issues werediscussed. There was a certain amount of tension during this session,as each side complained that the other did not understand its needs.Industry members said that it seemed that implementation of the draftcriteria, or a version thereof, is a foregone conclusion on the part ofgovernment, without industry input concerning the entire concept.Specifically, industry members challenged the 64-bit maximum as beingarbitrary and unnecessary. They said that although 56-bit encryptionwas discussed with government last year, technology moves rapidly, andnow 64 bits are not enough. A NIST representative countered that theNational Security Agency is "putting a big card on the table" with 64bits. Industry members also protested that the criteria do not meet the needsof the global marketplace. Consumers will not buy products designed tomeet these criteria because they already have access to 64-bitencryption with no keys either free or at a low cost. They argued thatthe scope of the criteria (e.g., criterion nine) is broader than thestated objective of exportability, and requested more information as towhy each criterion is being proposed. Concern also was raised thatforeign countries with bi-lateral agreements with the U.S. will actagainst U.S. key escrow agents. Also, industry will not know the termsof these agreements. Export Procedures Officials of Department of State and the Department of Commerceexplained in general terms how this program would work. Eachapplication would go first to the State Department for a jurisdictionalcertification on technical aspects. If State were satisfied that thecriteria had been met, then it would certify the application over tothe Commerce Department for general licensing procedures. There wouldalso be an escrow package, that would have to be certified. It was notclear who would control the certification of escrow agents. Escrow Agents The issue of who could be an escrow agent and how they would becontrolled was discussed, but not resolved. The issues of liabilityfor wrongful release, the conditions of release, and related questionswere not resolved. It seemed clear to me that escrow agents would haveto be independent of the user entity. If this law firm were to use anencryption package in its London office, the key would have to beplaced with a third party. Conclusion While no issues were resolved at the meeting, it provided a valaubleforum for the exchange of ideas between government and industry. Focusnow turns to Congress, and to the crafting of a constructive responseto the upcoming Federal Register notice. The Administration seems opento changes. The mass market software industry and the public interestcommunity seem negative. We will continue to keep you informed. Mr Plesser then included a list of the 10 criteria. Rather thanrepeat them here, the NIST 10 criteria link can be used. Back to Pat'sNIS&T Key Escrow/Export Meeting page.

Proposed 64-bit Software Key Escrow Encryption Export Criteria Meeting Place: National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) Date: December 5, 1995 Moderator: Ed Roback, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Panel: Ed Appel, Michael R. Nelson, Ray Kammer, Geoff Greiveldinger, Clint Brooks IndustryPresenters: Bill Sweet, Ken Mendelson, Dorothy Denning, Melanie Janin, Ed Scheidt, Doug Miller, Shabbir Safdar, Viktor Hampel I. Ed Roback, National Institute of Standards and Technology Welcome Mr. Ed Roback, serving as moderator for the meeting, opened the meeting with a welcome, announcements (including notice the meeting would be taped) and introductions of the panel members. II. Michael R. Nelson, Co-Chairman IWG/ET Perspectives, Objective of Criteria, and Future Plans Dr. Michael R. Nelson presented the Administration's perspectives, objectives, and future plans. He explained the five goals and objectives for the December 5 meeting. They were as follows: 1. explain the criteria to ensure that they are clearly understood; 2. discuss the Administration's proposed desirable characteristics for key escrow agents and approach to developing and implementing an approval process; 3. understand reactions and desired changes to the draft criteria and proposed key escrow agent characteristics; 4. explain the Administration's plans to revise and implement these criteria (with revisions, as appropriate); 5. identify other areas requiring follow-up attention. Several questions from the audience included a request for assurance that the current issue is not establishing domestic regulation and why the key length was being limited to 64-bit keys. Dr. Nelson assured the group, the current discussion related to EXPORT criteria only. He stated that the key length (of the symmetric session key) is currently limited to 64-bits to see if this concept results in products for which the key escrow mechanism cannot be easily defeated. If, as time passes, the concept proves viable and resistant to attack, changes may be appropriate. III. Clint Brooks, National Security Agency Exportability Criteria Discussion Dr. Clint Brooks reviewed the Draft Software Key Escrow Encryption Export Criteria (11/95 version), including the six criteria associated with the key escrow feature, the two criteria associated with the key length feature, and one criterion each associated with the interoperability feature and design, implementation, and operational assurance. Criterion five, which requires a product's key escrow feature to allow access to the key(s) needed to decrypt the product's ciphertext regardless of whether the product sent or received the information, generated the most discussion. Dr. Brooks explained the primary need for the requirement was for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) to access a subject's communications when authorized. Criterion five generated such discussion that Mr. Ed Allen (FBI) supplemented Dr. Brooks presentation by detailing the LEA objective(s) for criterion 5. Some of the rationale included, LEA's gaining subject['s] key is consistent with the current approach of electronic surveillance (i.e. tapping lines) and helps preserve the ability to react in real time by obtaining *only* the subject's key. Mr. Allen addressed several questions regarding cooperation and status of agreements with other countries and he noted the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLANTS) would need to be modified. IV. Geoff Greiveldinger, U.S. Depsrtment of Justice Draft Key Escrow Agent Characteristics Mr. Geoff Greiveldinger reviewed the draft Key Escrow Agent Characteristics consisting of twenty criteria addressing escrow system integrity and security and key aceess requirements. The group questions primarily centered around criterion seven which requires at least one person who possess[es] a SECRET clearance for purposes of processing classified requests and requirements to maintain auditable records. Several participants, including one from Netscape, stated they do not endorse the Administration's proposal and that they are losing sales and having products returned, because of their inability to export products with marketable key escrow features. Questions were raised regarding what agency would grant approval and maintain valid holders. Additional concerns regarding escrow agents who later went out of business were raised. V. Industry Perspectives Bill Sweet, Trusted Information Systems Inc. Is There a Path to Global Information Security? Mr. Sweet's presentation included views that customers do not want escrow controlled by lots of other people, information owners should control their assets, not the government -- the information is someone else's property, the current proposal gives control to the receiver not where it should be with the sender, and American companies do not want some foreign countries to have access to keys. One key question was whether companies can designate where keys can be escrowed, even if the location is not the United States. Dr. Nelson responded that in addition to being held with an agent approved by the U.S., the current proposal does not disallow a company from designating somewhere other than the U.S., for example, Holland. Answers to questions regarding bilateral agreements with other countries were answered when a clear statement was made that no bilateral agreement need exist if keys are deposited in the U.S. A bilateral agreement is only necessary, when keys are exclusively held by another country. Kenneth A. Mendelson, Trusted Information Systems, Inc. A Private Sector Proposal for Trusted Third Party (a.k.a. Data Recovery Center) Registration Mr. Mendelson described his proposal for a vendor-based registration framework, including a "Trusted Third Party Application Form". He believes already-established procedures can be used to collect the required information. Dorothy E. Denning, Georgetown University Criterion #5: Access Through Sender and Receiver Rationale, Technical Approaches, Exposure Risks, and Wording Dr. Denning reviewed different approaches to key escrow encyption and to satisfying criterion #5, showing that the criterion is met by most products and proposals for key escrow. She also discussed the privacy implications of criterion #5 vs. one that would require access *only* through the sender, concluding that criterion #5 is *not* more invasive of privacy. Finally, her submitted paper discusses a concern that the current wording does not obligate the sending product to ensure access through the receiving product and suggests a rewrite. Her paper can be accessed at http://www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/crypto/ Melanie Janin, U. S. Council for International Business Comments on Encryption Policy at The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Ms. Janin presented a comparison of the U.S. Council's "Business Requirement for Encryption," issued over one year ago, with the U.S. Government's proposed policy. She found that some of the U.S. Council's requirements have been satisfied, some not, and some are unclear. Ms. Janin emphasized the U.S. Council's desire to meet with the Government to clarify some of these unresolved issues. Ed Scheidt, Tecsec Mr. Scheidt believed the next steps were to get moving and test products and the policy because it is essential to provide immediate relief for escrowed encryption and we need to rely on the Administration to bring U.S. privacy products to the rest of the world. Shaber Safdar, Voters Telecommunications Watch Mr. Safdar described an Internet survey of security professionals the Voters Telecommunications Watch group is conducting. The survey was posted one week prior to the December 5 meeting. They have received a total of 26 responses. Twenty-four of the twenty-six respondents stated they would never purchase software or hardware with law enforcemcnt access. Sixteen of these twenty-four responded they are already using products without law enforcerncnt access. Respondents would support industry in quest of market driven cryptographic standards. Robert W. Holleyman II, Business Software Alliance Testimony of Robert W. Holleyman II, President, Business Software Alliance, on Encryption Export Policy and thc U.S. Software Industry: Chipping Away at America's International Competitiveness. Mr. Holleyman believes that despite concerns expressed by companies and association, and privacy advocates, during previous NIST meetings, little has changed in the Administration's proposal. He believes the proposal is unworkable and unacceptable. He states that information security is critical and 40-bit keys are pathetic and although the proposal of 64-bit keys is an improvement, it is insufficient. He proposes a Cost of Cracking Adjustment (COCA), in which an automatic increase in the permissible key length by two bits every three years. The base length is based on immediately permitting the export of generally available software progruns employing the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algonthm or other algorithms at comparable strengths. David Sobol, Electronic Privacy Information Center Comments on Draft Export Criteria for Key Escrow Encryption Mr. Sobol states that users are unlikely to adopt key escrow systems on a voluntary basis, and is afraid what is voluntary will become standard and result in the eventual prohibition of non-escrowed products. He questions the role of public comment in the process, because it is frequently solicited but never heeded, referencing the 1993 proposed Escrowed Encryption Standard, or Clipper. Most comments were negative, as NIST acknowledged in its Federal Register notice adopting the standard. Another major issue, is the Cryptographic Competitiveness Study conducted by the Bureau of Export Administration has not been released. EPIC has initiated litigation under the FOIA seeking the release of the study. (Note: It was released on 1/18/96.) Padgett Peterson, Lockheed Martin Mr. Peterson commented that major corporations must be able to become licensed key agents, the issue of property rights is important, and policies must guarantee confidentiality to customers. Alex McIntosh, PC Security Limited (UK) Mr. McIntosh described a system his company designed for Shell. He believes control should be delivered to the desktop and states the issue of liability has been ignored and we must understand who will be liable. Doug Miller, Software Publishers Association Comments of thc Software Publishers Association on 11/95 Draft Export Criteria for Key Escrow Encryption Mr. Miller states member companies are poised to meet the needs of a secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infiastructure (GII), but cannot because of the barriers the U.S. cryptography policy continues to impose. Although the 11/95 draft criteria reflect a few of the suggested changes, the changes made are minor compared with the fundamental problems of the proposal. Members have analyzed the global marketplace for encryption and concluded key escrow systems will simply not be marketable in a world in which non- escrow encryption is widely available at greater than 40 bits. He further states that the Department of Commerce study will say there are not strong products out there but members of SPA say they are loosing business and bilateral agreanents will take a long time; U.S. companies need immediate relief. Viktor E. Hampel, Hampel Consulting A Consumer Protection Act for Digital Products (Proposal for an International Standard on the Labeling of Digital Products) Mr. Hampel reported that accountability had been unanimously agreed upon as the key issue for electronic commerce during panel discussions of the recent international elecro-optical engineering conference in Philadelphia, which included representation from such diverse groups as NSA and the electronic publishing association. To promote accountability in electronic transactions, Mr. Hampel proposed the labeling of digital products in a structured header to protect the intellectual property rights of providers -- equivalent to the visual copyright notices found on title pages of bound literary works. The descriptive digital product labels in the header would uniquely identify their source and contents and thus also help consumers decide what products they wish to see, hear, buy and use -- equivalent to the *visual* food labels on containers. According to Mr. Hampel's proposal, the proposed structures of the information header could be based on the international CALS Standards for the enveloping of digital data products, and on FIPS PUB 188 for the labeling of data. International standard for certified Public-Key digital signatures would bind the header information to the registered digital product to protect its integrity and authenticity. VI. Wrap-up and Adjourn Questions from the audience during the wrap up session included: What is the current time line for implementing the policy? The response was today if the draft criteria is met an export license can be obtained. Final policy can be expected in a few months since the last thing the Administration wants are criteria which preclude solutions to things government or industry needs. If a message is sent to 187 countries, where does the Data Recovery Center (DRC) have to be located? The response was that the escrow center could be in the U.S. or another country with which the U.S. has appropriate law enforcement and national security arrangements. However, the agent has to be certified. When and how will the policy be published? The Administration hopes to be completed in a few months and since the policy is a loosening of restrictions it does not have to go in the Federal Register for comment. Final implementation is likely to be a notice with criteria in the Federal Register. Several questions centered around the requirement for a SECRET clearance for at least one person for each Certified Escrow Agent. Responses included information that the person with the clearance does not have to run the DRC but can hold any position and standards will have to be developed for the certifying process. Other issues revolved around multinational companies which may be in compliance for 25% U.S.-owned one day and the next day may not be within the legal limits. Overall, the meeting did appear to help clarify the draft criteria for participants. No new significant issues were raised. [End] Back to Pat's page on the December 5 NIST Clipper 2 meeting.

This week our commentsis available, and a copy is being included into the NIST workshopreport. CHANGES IN US CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY In BillWatch (Issue #14) we described the background surrounding theannouncement of the government's new "Key Escrow" proposal. In thisissue we give a report on the outcome of the NIST Key Escrow workshop(Sep. 6th and 7th in Gaithersberg MD) where the trial lead balloon ofClipper II was presented to industry and the public. Clipper II: Don't trip over the dogs and ponies INTRODUCTION Last year many people announced that "Clipper is dead". Contrary tothat belief, several civil liberties organizations warned that although the use of the Clipper Chip is probably dead, the public hadnot heard the last from the government on their war on your right tohave a private conversation. Indeed, as predicted, the governmentproposed a new program this summer called Commercial Key Escrow ("Sonof Clipper" or "Clipper II"). WHAT IS COMMERCIAL KEY ESCROW? Remember the Clipper Chip? It was a scheme that allowed you to have aprivate conversation (encrypted) with any other person, except that thegovernment would have a built-in way of decoding that conversation. Manypeople found it unacceptable to have government-designed built-in backdoors to telephones and software. Under Clipper II, the government still requires those back doors be builtinto the products. However the encryption key that scrambles yourconversation would be held by a third party, another company called a"commercial escrow agent". When law enforcement wanted to decryptyour files or your communications they would go to the escrow agent anddemand the keys to decrypt your information. This is even worse than the original Clipper for a number of reasonsoutlined in the presentations given by civil liberties advocates.Instead of the government telling you that you had to let them listento your conversations, under commercial key escrow they require thatboth they and an "escrow company" have access to your encryption keys. Both public advocates and industry representatives viewed this as just asunacceptable as the original Clipper proposal. NIST HOLDS SOMETHING AKIN TO A PUBLIC FORUM This week (Sep 6th and 7th) NIST (National Institute of Standards andTechnology) conducted a key escrow workshop" in Gaithersburg Maryland.Advertised as a place for industry to bring their concerns over keyescrow but "open to the public", it was heavily attended by industryrepresentatives. A few advocates of the public interest crashed theparty anyway and to NIST's credit, we were not turned away and evenallowed to present our dissenting views. Representatives from the ACLU(American Civil Liberties Union), CDT (Center for Democracy andTechnology), EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Center) and VTW(Voters Telecommunications Watch) all were in attendance to critiquethe proposal. A transcript of VTWs testimony is available at the endof this document. [actually, I split the document into smaller parts.Follow this link for VTW's comments on Escrow] Here's how the workshop worked:First, NIST, in concert with the law enforcement and intelligencecommunities, came up with a set of ten criteria for a commercial keyescrow system and for certifying escrow agents. No public input wassolicited. Second, while representatives of the White House uttered the mantras of"export decontrol" and "foreign markets", industry representatives wereshown a complicated scheme whereby law enforcement would have accessto the keys, all while consumers would still be allowed to encrypt theirdata. At the workshop, industry representatives were broken up into groups andcharged with examining and improving the standards for commercial keyescrow proposed by the Administration. As expected, this scheme backfired. As each group reported back to thelarger audience, industry representatives fell over each other to ensurethat no one considered their attendance at this workshop an endorsementof commercial key escrow. Two of the groups experienced what could bestbe described as revolts. In one group several individuals, led by anrepresentative from the ACLU, tried to pass a resolution to remove therestrictions on export of cryptography, something clearly unacceptable tothe government. It was defeated on a tie vote of 7-7. A second industry working group made their report and published thefollowing statement, [..] There is a concern that we will be viewed as endorsing the [government proposal]. Specifically, we are worried that a report from these meetings will reflect a consensus and endorsement of the policy proposals put forth by the government when this is not the case. The process is driven too much by the concerns of law enforcement and national security. It is not industry led and market driven. We see little attempt to find the common ground that meets market export needs, law enforcement and national security. The best next step is to table the criteria and work with industry organizations to further define what can and cannot work. Crippled cryptography will be a commercial flop for everybody. We are also concerned that FIPS will be decided on the 15th and the entire exercise will be slam dunk. [..] WHY THE RUSH? Industry representatives, while not repeating the mantra "My attendanceshould not constitute an endorsement of key escrow", were all asking "Whyare we in such a hurry?" The answer may lie in a review of key escrowhistory. When the original Clipper plan was announced many suspected it wasbecause a manufacturer was about to release an encrypting telephonedevice of DES (Data Encryption Standard) strength. Dissuaded fromreleasing that product, they were convinced to allow the government totry their hand at a Clipper version of that product. Similar rumors were thick at the workshop this week. The rumor millsuggested that another company is about to release a secure telephoneproduct domestically that does not have a built-in government back door. However noting the lack of marketplace enthusiasm for Clipper products,the company is not rumored to be waiting for a key escrow proposal to befinished. They will simply be releasing the product for the domesticmarket only. Keep an eye out for product announcements to see if thisrumor is true. IS CLIPPER II OR COMMERCIAL KEY ESCROW A "SLAM DUNK"? Many have critiqued the administrations cryptography policy as beingtoo dominated by law enforcement and national security interests.Indeed the original Clipper proposal proposed by NIST went through aperiod of public comment. NIST received 185 comments on the proposal,183 of them opposing it. Over the objections of the public andindustry and with the support of only law enforcement and theintelligence community, NIST went ahead and made the Clipper proposal astandard. Even before the workshop was over, the question of whether thecommercial key escrow proposal would become a FIPS (Federal InformationProcessing Standard) standard was answered. The "shoe dropped" twiceon the first day of the workshop. The first indication came when ahigh-profile NSA representative admitted during a break that thegovernment was going to go forward with Clipper II as an experiment,hoping it would be acceptable by the marketplace. The second, more public, indication that Clipper II would become anational standard came during a session wrapup given by NIST staffer EdRoback. In talking about the possibility of Clipper II becoming astandard, Mr. Roback confessed on the podium, "Well, it's been more orless decided that it's going to happen." DO PUBLIC ADVOCATES HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR? The futility of stopping such an unpopular proposal set a Kafka-esquetone to the proceedings. Attendee Carl Ellison suggested the followingalternative to the government's key escrow proposal. The NSA and theFBI could each generate a PGP key which he would sign. Those publickeys would each be include in products. When you as a user of suchproducts are encrypting stored data or a communication, you will havethe option of choosing whether or not to store an encryption keyavailable for those two agencies. It certainly fits the model of a voluntary system. Users who do notwish to voluntarily use the system simply choose not to enclose a copyof their keys for law enforcement and the intelligence community.Somehow we expect it will not be embraced by the White House. WHAT CAN YOU DO? Within a few weeks NIST will issue a request for comments on makingClipper II (Commercial Key Escrow) a FIPS standard (Federal InformationProcessing Standard). It is most important that when that happens yousubmit an objection to the standard. Having this record of publicopposition to the proposal will serve public advocates well in the debatesover such schemes in the future. Take some time to review the testimonybelow and watch for announcements about the standards process. WHERE CAN I LEARN MORE?

The information inthis paper is not intended to represent fail-safe, cookie cutter solutions tothe criteria, but only to generate more detailed discussions." It is also interesting to note that John Young has an electronic documentwith all of the sample solutions (a solution for each of the ten criteria).I never saw a paper document with all ten solutions. The one that was handed to me had only two criteria, #5 and #6. I talked to attendeesof other breakouts, and they had received nothing.

This records notes and comments from the second C1/C2 breakout session atthe NIS&T Encryption Key Escrow Export meeting. The session occuredabout 4:00 PM on September 6, 1995. The session started with the folks from National Semiconductor described theirCAKE system. This is a smartcard/PCMCIA device that uses 2000+ bit public/private key encryption and signatures. They are hoping for exportapproval; it is necessary for the project to be viable. The system lookspretty interesting, but it too complicated to describe here. In short, random session keys are generated and signed with a Data Recovery Center's(DRC) public key. The LEAs could then send encrypted session keys to the DRC, which would decrypt them, and return the unencrypted session keys whichthe LEA could then used to decrypt the messages. While this is a hardware system, its concepts could be transfered to a software implementation. One obvious problem is that CAKE's system doesn't meet criteria #8 (requiringrepeated involvement of the escrow agent), since it may requirehundreds or thousands of session key decipherments. A second problem exists if the National Semiconductor product's approach is implemented in software. It is possible that the software couldmodified so that a bogus DRC key is used. The rest of the protocol would work, but the sessions would not be recoverable. This would preclude any authorized government access to the sessions. It also has a number of attractive features, such as never sending the private key anywhere, only the session key is escrowed. The general discussion showed concerns that in the internationalcommunity, requiring government escrow may cause loss of valuable data,as some foriegn governments are not as trustworthy as the US. It wasthe consensus that requiring users to have 50 or more escrow centers wasunworkable. Yet this could be required for large multinational companiesworking in 50 or more countries, if each required a local key escrow service. The CAKE model would allow both date stamping of session keys, and periodicrekeying. Either would satisfy my "unaccepted" Citeria #11, technicallimits to the time that a court ordered decryption could be executed. There was a discussion of changing the criteria so that only the transmissionof data was concerned with escrow. This would simplify the issue ofmultinational escrow. We did not resolve whether this would be sufficientor acceptable. I believe that most of the participants had "run out of steam" before,or during, this session. It did not generate the lively discussionsthat occured constantly during the earlier session. Follow this link to the writeup ofthe breakout session on Criterias #5 and 6.

Key Escrow Agent Criteria Introduction An often heard concern regarding key escrow encryption is that users of such encryption are vulnerable to abuse of the escrowed key by the escrow agents or others. Many have suggested that changes in the law were needed that specifically, criminalize any such abuses. We agree that such laws will be beneficial in deterring act by anyone to access escrowed keys without authority or to undermine the integrity of the escrow key system. However, the availability of criminal prosecution is not alone sufficient. Key escrow agents must be selected no only with a view towards assuring the availability of escrowed keys for properly authorized government officials, but also to assure that the escrow agents have the commitment and means to protect the confidentiality of integrity of the keys they escrow and the escrow system. This will be particularly important if, as expect will occur, some key escrow products will be designed such that the escrow agent could discern the identity of the user from the keys and other information that is escrowed with them. The following criteria were drafted with these principals in mind. We have not yet addresses conditions under which users can be the sole repository of the keys for their system. We recognize that some organizations or people do not want anybody but themselves to escrow their keys. However, since an important reason for escrowing is to preserve effective law enforcement, we must assure authorized officials can reliably and timely obtain access to escrowed keys through entities independent of the subject of electronic surveillance. Thus we welcome suggestions on how best to meet this range of interests. In considering the criteria appropriate for approving escrow agents, we considered what the government needs to assure it has timely and reliable access when authorized and what key escrow encryption users would want to ensure that the escrowing of keys foes not undermine their security. Of course, the government is also a user of key escrow encryption products and shares with other users an interest to ensure the integrity and security of the escrow system. Similarly, organizations interested in data recovery share the government�s interest to have a system through which access to escrowed key is enabled under appropriate circumstances. With these considerations in mind, we developed criteria in two categories, �Escrow System Integrity and Security� and �Key Access Requirements.� We expect that prospective escrow agents that meet criteria such as these would be considered �approved� escrow agents for export purposes, to hold keys for government systems, etc. Note that keys and/or key components for devices that may process classified information shall be escrowed with escrow agents entities selected by the US government, and that those escrow agents entities may be required to meet more stringent requirements. Escrow System Integrity and Security 1. Escrow agent entities shall devise and institutionalize policies, procedures, and mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of key escrow related information. a. Escrow agents entities shall be designed and operated so that a failure by a single person, procedure, or mechanism does not compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the key and/or key components (e.g. two person control of keys, split key, etc.) b. Unencrypted escrow key and/or key components that are stored and/or transmitted electronically shall be protected (e.g., via encryption) using approved means. c. Unencrypted escrowed key and/or key components stored and/or transferred via other media/methods shall be protected using approved means (e.g. safes). 2. Escrow agent entities shall ensure due form of escrow key access requests and authenticate the requests for escrowed key and/or key components. 3. Escrow agent entities shall protect against disclosure of information regarding the identity of the person/organization whose key and/or key components is requested, and the fact that the key and/or key components was requested or provided. 4. Escrow agent entities shall enter key/key components into the escrowed key database immediately upon receipt. 5. Escrow agent entities shall escrow at least two copies of any key and/or key component in independent locations to help ensure the availability of such key and/or key component due to unforeseen circumstances. 6. Escrow agent entities that are certified by the U.S. government shall work with developers of key escrow encryption products to develop and support a feature that allows the product to verify to one another that the product�s keys have been escrowed with a U.S.-certified agent. Key Access Requirement 7. An escrow agent entity shall employ one or more persons who possess a SECRET clearance for purposes of processing classified (e.g. FISA) requests to obtain keys and/or key components. 8. Escrow agent entities shall protect against unauthorized disclosure information regarding the identity of the organization requesting the key and key components. 9. Escrow agent entities shall maintain data regarding all key escrow requests received, key escrow components released, database changes, system administration accesses, and dates of such events, for purpose of audit by appropriate government officials and others. 10. Escrow agent entities shall maintain escrowed keys and/or key components for as long as such keys may be required to decrypt information relevant to a law enforcement investigation. 11. Escrow agent entities shall provide key/key components to authenticated requests in a timely fashion and shall maintain a capability to respond more rapidly to emergency requirements for access. 12. Escrow agent entities shall posses and maintain a Certificate if Good Standing from the State of Incorporation (or similar local/national authority). 13. Escrow agent entities shall provide to the U.S. government a Dun & Bradstreet/TRW number or similar credit report pointer and authorization. 14. Escrow agent entities shall possess and maintain an Errors & Omissions insurance policy. 15. Escrow agent entities shall provide to the U.S. government a written copy of, or a certification of the existence of, a corporate security policy governing the key escrow agent entity�s operation. 16. Escrow agent entities shall provide to the U.S. government a certification that the escrow agent entity will comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws concerning the provisions of escrow agent entity services. 17. Escrow agent entities shall provide to the U.S. government a certification that the escrow agent entity will transfer to another approved escrow agent the escrow agent entity�s equipment and data in the event of any dissolution or other cessation of the escrow agent entity operations. 18. Escrow agent entities for products sold in the U.S. shall not be a foreign country or entity thereof, a national of a foreign country, or a corporation of which an alien is an officer or more than one-fourth of the stock which is owned by aliens or which is directly or indirectly controlled by such a corporation. Foreign escrow agent entities for products exported from the U.S. will be approved on a case by case basis as law enforcement agreement and national security agreements can be negotiated. 19. Escrow agent entities shall provide to the U.S. government a certificate that the escrow agent entity will notify the U.S. government in writing of any changes in the forgoing information. 20. Fulfillment of these and the other criteria is subject to periodic recertification. Back to Pat's page on the December 5 MIST Clipper 2 meeting. Back to Pat'sClipper II page.

Weitzner, Deputy Director on behalf of the Center for Democracy and Technology On Privacy and Security Policy Issues Raised by Commercial Key Escrow Systems September 7, 1995 National Institute of Standards and TechnologyGaithersburg, MD I. Introduction My name is Daniel Weitzner, Deputy Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology. The Center is pleased to have opportunity to provide comments on the Administrations proposed private key escrow policies. The Center for Democracy and Technology is an independent, non-profit public interest policy organization in Washington, DC. The Center's mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital communications media. The Center achieves its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition building. CDT also coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG), an ad hoc coalition of more than 50 computer, communications, and public interest organizations and associations working on communications privacy issues. In the past, members of the Working Group have strongly opposed the Administration's Clipper Chip and worked on the Digital Telephony bill now passed into law. CDT is pleased that the Administration has made the commitment to develop a comprehensive communications security policy. The original announcement to base such a policy on the private key escrow principles espoused in the Vice President' letter of July 1994 had great promise. As we will illustrate below, however, the policy announced in September 1995 falls far short of the goals outlined by the Vice President and the needs of individual users and the industry. Indeed, without substantial modification, the policy offers little to users, the market, or privacy advocates. However, we remain committed to working with the Administration and the Congress to develop a comprehensive and balanced encryption policy that will meet user privacy needs and the legitimate interests of law enforcement agencies. We continue to believe that the Gore letter contained the road map for such a policy and hope that the current efforts can be redirected along those lines. II. The Promise of the Gore Letter: Potential for policy breakthrough to meet the needs users, industry, and law enforcement With the explosive growth of the Internet and other interactive media, United States encryption policy has gone from a relatively unnoticed backwater of national security policy, to a highly visible and highly contentious area of technology policy of great concern to many industry groups and privacy advocates alike. In this transition, there have been some missteps, including the Clipper Chip initiative. After an unsuccessful effort to build support for the Clipper Chip in the market and the policy arena, the Clinton Administration announced its intention to develop a new encryption policy that would strike a more reasonable balance between the needs of users, the demands of the computer and communications marketplace, and the legitimate needs of law enforcement. The move away from reliance on the Clipper Chip marked an important turning point in the development of encryption policy. First announced in a letter from Vice President Al Gore to Congresswoman Maria Cantwell on July 20, 1994, the Administration made a commitment to develop a policy framework that would promote the development of encryption systems that would meet the following criteria: Implementation in hardware or software: After the hardware-only Clipper solution, the Administration recognized that any system must, according to the Gore letter, be "implementable in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof." Public, unclassified algorithms: In order to assure users that their communications are truly secure, systems must employ encryption algorithms that are public, and thus subject to scrutiny by the broadest possible technical community. Thus, the Vice President promised that the new policy "would not rely upon a classified algorithm." Voluntary: Although the Clipper Chip was always described as a voluntary technology, considerable fears arose that its use might one day become mandatory. The Gore letter asserted that any new policy must be based on purely voluntary standards. Fourth Amendment privacy safeguards: Electronic surveillance constitutes an invasion of the most private realms of individual activity. In order to protect individuals from unnecessary or excessive invasions by law enforcement agencies, Congress and the courts have instituted careful safeguards in the realm of traditional electronic surveillance through the telephone. The Vice President's letter called for the extension of these protections in the form of "safeguards to provide for key disclosure only under legal authorization and should have audit procedures to ensure the integrity of the system." Statutory liability rules to protect users: In order to encourage users to trust private escrow systems, "escrow holders should be strictly liable for releasing keys without legal authorization," according to the Gore letter. Multiple escrow agents: Users must be free to chose their own escrow agents, unlike the Clipper proposal, so the Vice President declared that "a new key escrow encryption system must permit the use of private-sector key escrow agents as one option.... Having a number of escrow agents would give individuals and businesses more choices and flexibility in meeting their needs for secure communications." III. Current Administration Proposal Fails to Meet High Standards Set out by the Vice President The policy announced by the Administration in its September 1, 1995 paper, unfortunately fails to meet many of the criteria that the Vice President himself announced just one year ago in the above mentioned letter. On hearing that the Administration had set out to develop a new encryption policy based on the principles outlined in the Gore letter, the Center for Democracy and Technology was guardedly optimistic that a genuine policy breakthrough was possible. However, having had the opportunity to review the current proposal, every principle, except the first (software implementation) and second (public algorithms), thoughtfully outlined in the July 1994 letter is violated or, in one case, left in doubt, by the September 1995 policy statement. The September 1995 policy statement diverges from the July 1994 letter in the following critical respects. In our view, these divergences represent fundamental defects in the proposed policy and must be corrected. Not Voluntary: The current proposal effectively compels all domestic users to use key escrow systems if they ever intend to communicate internationally. Point 6 of the export criteria requires that an exportable system must not interoperate with any system that non-escrow systems. Thus, in order for a user in the United States to communicate with anyone who uses a United States-made system on the Internet but outside of the United States, the American user must employ a key escrow system. Domestic users are not legally compelled to use key escrow products, but the proposed policy forces, in practice, all but the most insular Internet user is propelled toward a key escrow system. A policy based on such compulsion can hardly be called voluntary. Inadequate Security: Point 1 precludes export of systems with key lengths beyond 64 bits. Though this key size is larger than what is currently exportable, it is a level of security already judged inadequate for some applications. Given the rate at which computing power increases, even a 64 bit key would be subject to attach before long. The premise of the key escrow policy is to provide law enforcement and national security agencies a "front door" to be used to decrypt messages when the agency obtains proper legal authorization. Yet, the architects of the current policy apparently are not willing to trust that key escrow systems will meet law enforcement needs inasmuch as the key length limit suggests that the Administration is intent on maintaining an extra-legal method of decrypting communications. The Gore letter contains no suggestion that key escrow systems would also be subject to key length limits but the Administration seems to have lost faith in its own proposal. Such a half-hearted effort cannot be the basis of a long-lasting policy. No privacy protection for users of escrowed systems: The ten export principles make no mention of privacy safeguards which the Vice President previously recognized as necessary to safeguard individual privacy and Fourth Amendment principles. Any escrow policy must contain safeguards against abuse and statutory liability provisions for the operators of private escrow systems. Fails to Promote International Interoperability: Points 6 and 10 of the export criteria raise grave doubts as to the likelihood that the current proposal will give rise to a secure global communications environment. Point 10 forces users in other countries (and their governments) to accept United States-based escrow of all keys until bilateral access agreements are entered into. Such tactics seem unlikely to produce satisfactory international agreements, and hold global communications security hostage to the completion of such agreements. IV. Recommendations to Restore Current Process to Principles of Gore Letter The Administration's September 1 paper leaves many privacy concerns unanswered or simply rejected, and falls far short of the goals set in the Gore letter of July 1994. However, CDT still believes that the Administration has embarked on a serious process which, along with appropriate Congressional involvement, can lead to a long-lasting resolution to the encryption policy morass that exists today. CDT recommends the following steps be taken immediately to supplement the September 1 policy framework. A. Legislation to protect user privacy, address legitimate law enforcement needs, and guarantee voluntariness Encryption is now a key enabling technology in the development of the National and Global Information Infrastructure. The growth of electronic commerce, the protection of intellectual property, and the very viability of cyberspace as an economic, social, cultural and political arena depend on the widespread availability of strong encryption. As such, encryption policy can no longer be made in the closed halls Executive Branch national security policy. Like the Clipper Chip before it, the proposed key escrow policy framework places the National Security Agency in control of private sector computer security policy. Such a role for the NSA is both detrimental to the growth of the information infrastructure and contrary to the principles of the Computer Security Act of 1987. The Computer Security Act clearly established that neither military nor law enforcement agencies are the proper protectors of personal privacy. When considering the law, Congress asked, "whether it is proper for a super-secret agency [the NSA] that operates without public scrutiny to involve itself in domestic activities...?" The answer was a clear "no." As important as the principle of civilian control was in 1987, it is even more critical today. The more individuals around the country come to depend on secure communications to protect their privacy, the more important it is to conduct privacy and security policy dialogues in public, civilian forums. If encryption policy is to be based on private key escrow as proposed by the Administration, legislative action is required to assure: Complete voluntariness: No government action should compel individuals or corporations to use key escrow systems; User choice of among multiple private escrow agents: Any entity that meets statutory criteria should be allowed to be an escrow agent. Free market mechanisms should be allowed to meet the varying needs of users; User choice of encryption algorithm: Different users with different applications will need varying degrees of security and should be allowed to chose the level and type of encryption appropriate to their needs. Individual choice and market innovation, not government fiat, should guide choice of encryption algorithm; Statutory framework for law enforcement access and agent liability for improper disclosure: Under law, a private escrow agent could only legally disclose a users to those who are approved by the user, or to an authorized law enforcement agency, upon presentation of a 4th Amendment warrant. Private escrow agents (PEAs) would operate under a statutory framework which requires a PEA to hold private keys for users under a special standard of care and creates remedies in the event of unauthorized disclosure. In providing assistance to enable law enforcement to decrypt communications, the PEA may not disclose the target's private key to law enforcement. However, as stated in the ten criteria and as much as is technically feasible, law enforcement should be assured speedy, uninterrupted access to decrypted communications once the surveillance is judicially approved. Audit trails for law enforcement access: PEA's would be legally required to configure their systems in such a way to create a trusted and complete audit trail of all key access events. This audit function would provide key holders with the ability to seek damages from the PEA if necessary and could act as a check on law enforcement activity. B. Export Control Reform Full Export Authorization: Private key escrow systems that meet these principles should be fully exportable, under Commerce Department jurisdiction. End key-size limitations: All properly escrowed encryption systems must be eligible for export, regardless of key size. Since escrow systems would give law enforcement and national security agencies access to all communications, there can no longer be any justification for limiting key size. V. Conclusion As measured by the demands of privacy and security, and by the standards set out in the 1994 Gore letter, the current key escrow policy proposals fall short of the mark. However, CDT remains committed to working within the process set out by the Administration, and with the Congress, toward a speedy resolution of all of these critical encryption policy issues.

Sender's CAKE token creates a random block-encryption        message key (typically DES) and encrypts a message.   2.   Sender's token encrypts the message key with each        receiver's public key creating N lockboxes (encrypted        keys)   3.   It uses the Data Recovery Center's (DRC) public key to        encrypt the message key and the sender's identity, and        attaches the DRC's plaintext identifier to create a        Data Recovery Field (DRF)   4.   Sender's token hashes the message to obtain a message        digest   5.   Sender's token encrypts the message digest with        sender's private key, creating a digital signature   6.   Sender & token transmit his certificate, the DRC        certificate, receivers' lockboxes (encrypted keys),        DRF, encrypted message, and signature to receiver   7.   Receiver obtains certificates, lockboxes, DRF,        encrypted message, and signature. Receiver's token        verifies the two certificate issuers' signatures with        the issuers' public keys and obtains sender's and        DRC's authenticated public keys   8.   Receiver's token unlocks his lockbox containing the        message key with his private key (ignoring the other        receivers' lockboxes)   9.   Receiver's token calculates the anticipated DRF using        information from the certificates and the message key   10A. If the newly calculated DRF does not match the        transmitted DRF, the receiver's token will not decrypt        the message or disclose ths message key   10B. If the DRF is correct, the receiver's token decrypts        the message with the message key   11.  Receiver's token hashes the message to obtain a        message digest   12.  Receiver's token decrypts the signature with the        sender's public key to obtain the sender's message        digest   13.  Receiver's token compares its message digest with the        sender's and determines if the signature (and message)        are valid   [Box]   Data Recovery Center      A user, corporation or government can determine the Data      Recovery Center's ID(s) from the DRF(s) attached to      locked (encrypted) file(s) and request that file(s) be      unlocked. Upon proper authentication, the DRC uses its      private key to decrypt the DRF(s) and deliver the      decrypted message key(s) to the requesting party, who      then decrypts the message(s)   [Box]   Verify-Me Challenge      In a "who are you" challenge, the challenging party      sends the challenged token a random number, which the      challenged token returns encrypted with the Verify-Me      private key and the factory certificate authenticating      the Verify-Me public key and the device identity. If the      random number is decrypted with the factory-certified      public key, the challenged token proves its identity      (and that the device is hardware, model # xxxx).

Clipper II, meeting December 5 1995 Table of contents Summary Comments on product criteria Comments on interoperability concerns comments on key escrow agent entity criteria Comments on presentations Government Closing remarks and misc. comments Who's Who My Personal Opinions Copyrights and other similar stuff Summary One of the most significant things was obvious inthe parking lot. Unlike September's meeting, this time it was empty.Inside the hall, it was obvious that no one came. It was packed inSeptember, and now, entire rows were empty. I'm bad at guessing numbers,but its easy to guess that only 1/3 as many people showed. Maybe less. The meeting was hosted by Ed Roback of NIST, who quickly introducedMike Nelson of the White House. Mike is clearly a political guy.His handout says: "We believe that our proposal for exportable 64-bit keyescrow encryption meets these goals [the goals of VP Gore's letter to RepCantwell, July 20, 1994]." He said that the criteria describe a solution,but not the only solution. He said it does not preclude otherimplementations in the future. He anticipates that the State Departmentwill issue guidance based upon these criteria in "early 1996," and thatbetween now and then, any product that meets the criteria will be elegiblefor expidited approval. Of course, the existing (slow as molasass) processwill continue. I asked the first questions from the floor. The two questions were:(1) Is this meeting concerned solely with exportof software, or does it deal with controling domestic use of strongcryptography? and (2) since the 64-bit limit was severly criticized atthe Sept meeting, why is it still needed if there is also escrow? His answer was that there is "no intention to control domestic encryption"and on the 64-bit issue, that the government is "not certain it willwork." he says they "want to see it implemented and want to seehow it works" because 64-bit encryption is very strong. If the escrowdoesn't work, they don't want a lot of softare to be in widespread use. He said that they have studied the encryption that is supposed to be widelyavailable on the Internet. He said that viewed by crypto experts, notmuch is very good. He mentioned "two incidents" where Netscape hadweak implimentations. He feels that companies will not trust softwareover the 'net. that they "want the US Government to say that 'this isgood enough'." [I don't know what two incidents that he spoke of. There were four separatenoteworthy postings about Netscape, two were breaking RC4-40, Ian Goldbergshowed that the random seed was ineptly implemented, and Ray Cromwellshowed a trivial buffer overflow bug that could lead to serious security problems.] Clint Brooks, of NSA, then went over the revised criteria. He claimed thatthey were surprized at the industry concern over "one product" forworldwide markets. There were lots of questions. He eventually admittedthat because of the "one product" concern, export regulations will effectdomestic products. [all the more reason for Netscape to keep building tenor whatever it is.] Brooks admitted that it is impossible to prevent multiple encryption.Cypherpunks would do that by using PGP and then sending it using GAK.He said "as a person, you can set up a secure communication method, andnothing can be done about it." His concern is not that smart people canhave stronger crypto, but that strong crypto will be easy and widely used. He said that the 64-bit key limit is not meant to restrict RSA keys to64-bits, but rather to restrict the session keys that are encrypted usingRSA. Unspoken was the assumption that the 2000 bit RSA secret key wouldhave to be escrowed. There were some interesting (and bad IMHO) implications of interoperability.I'll cover them more in the long version. Basically, they admitted thatthe interoperability restrictions made it stupid to have an exportversion, you should have a strong domestic version, and an internationalversion developed offshore for sale to the rest of the world. They admitted that there can be no controls over export of data, so onceinteroperating software is available both domestically and from offshoresources, there is no value in the export controlled, crippled version. My favorite policeman, Geoff Greiveldinger, then described thecharacteristics of an acceptable key escrow agent. There was a long listof criteria, all unseen before the meeting. The general reactionof the audience was that these were "yet another set of criteria thatmust be met." Geoff claimed that they were simply trying to addressthe questions raised at the earlier meeting about who is anacceptable escrow agent. One point that caused a lot of concernwas that at least one employee of the escrow agent has to have a SECRETclearence. Industry, with a few exceptions, soundly said that this is a dumb idea,that there is no market, that the criteria are too hard, etc. ExceptPadgett Petersen, representing Lockheed-Martin. He said that LM thoughtthat the criteria were just peachy. The usual civil liberties folksalso soundly trashed it. There was a representative from Netscape. He said that they, as a companythink this is a terrible idea. They oppose it now, and will be issuinga company policy soon. I didn't catch his name, and couldn't find himto get the obviously carefully prepared text. One of what I thought were the most important admissions was made by Geoff G. in response to a question phrased about corporations"holding their own keys." He was forced to admit that wedo "have a right to hold your own keys." Product Criteria This covers the product criteria, except interoperability. There is a fair amount of information on the NIST web server. Use url:http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/ Nelson said that they have studied the encryption that is supposed to be widely available on the Internet.He said that viewed by crypto experts, not much is very good. He mentioned "two incidents" whereNetscape had weak implementations. He feels that companies will not trust software over the 'net. thatthey "want the US Government to say that 'this is good enough'." Clint Brooks, of NSA, then went over the revised criteria. He claimed that theywere surprised at the industry concern over "one product" for worldwide markets. He stated that they were addressing "not domestic policy, per se, but wekeep wrapping around" because of the 'one product' issue. The criteria are on the NIST page,url: http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/criteria.txt They handed out a guide to the changes in the criteria between Septemberand now. This is available from NIST as url:http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/bground.html Here is a portion of it: Old Criterion 1. Moved to #7; Old Criterion 2. Moved to #8; Old Criterion 3. Split into #1 and #2 Old Criterion 5. Moved to #10 Old Criterion 6. Moved to #9; Old Criterion 7. Moved to #5; Old Criterion 8. Moved to #6; Old Criterion 9. Deleted. Old Criterion 10. Moved to #3; Only in Washington. Oh yeah, they also clarified a lot of the wording. Ideas that I thought important enough to make notes of concerning thecriteria: These criteria do not address either hardware nor non-escrow encryption.Export controls of these are not changed, they can be exported with thecurrent procedures. Brooks said that these rules are not applicable to the protection ofinternal data for US corporations, even for overseas locations of US firms.He said that getting permission to export for _internal corporate use_ iseasy, if it is to protect corporate secrets and for internal communication.I took this to mean that a multi-national, US-based corporatgon can get apermit for ViaCrypt and export it for their own use. [later in the day,some people mentioned that this isn't nearly as easy as Brooks claimed.] He said that the intent in the new wording is flexibility. They don't wantto prescribe implementation details, he wants industry to invent whatsells. He specifically stated that the meetings were not about settingstandards. This caused at least a fair amount of confusion, probably due tothe fact that NIST used to be called National Bureau of Standards, and NBSset standards all the time. For example, a couple of folks were interestedin interoperability, say between a Netscape encryption system and one madeby, say, Microsoft. This meeting did not address this level ofinteroperability. about #2, "The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall beinoperable until the key(s) is escrowed in accordance with #3." Brooks saidthat the intent was to allow vendors to make a single product that doesn'tactivate the key-escrow function if not needed. The idea was that when thekeys are escrowed, the encryption engine would be activated. He also saidthat "manufacturers may not want to be in the key escrow business" andwould therefore want to ship products that could be activated by a thirdparty escrow agent. While talking about #3, 3. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions' key(s)shall be escrowed with escrow agent(s) certified by the U.S.Government, or certified by foreign governments with whichthe U.S. Government has formal agreements consistent withU.S. law enforcement and national security requirements. He stated that this does not preclude the use of "other agents." Thisbecame a major issue throughout the day. Ken Mendelson, staff attorney atTIS, asked (roughly) "Under what authority does the US Government grantcertification to agents?" The response was a run around. Another hot issuewas whether you can "hold your own keys" rather than using a third party.Seems that the corporate users are arguing that they want to hold their ownkeys, and the government reacted to that favorably (not unfavorably?).[Later in the day, Geoff Greiveldinger was asked if US citizens have theright to hold their own keys. Geoff was forced to admit that, "yes, you canhold your own keys"] "5. The product's key escrow feature shall allow access to thekey(s) needed to decrypt the product's ciphertext regardlessof whether the product generated or received the ciphertext." Contains a significant change that was not discussed in September. It meansthat having the key for either end is sufficient. Brooks conceded that thiswas a big change, but claimed it was needed. The claim that one-endedsurveillance is easier is most likely true. It clearly is easier if oneend is US based and using GAK and the other is foreign where there isrespect for civil liberties. He even claimed that it made the system less intrusive: His argument wasroughly: Lets say they are snooping on me. With one-ended, they can read all of mymessages, to and from, without needing the keys of my correspondents. (letspick Geoff G. as an arbitrary correspondent) With two ended, they'd have toget both my key and Geoff's, and then they could read all of the messagesGeoff gets or sends. I said it was their argument. Seems to me to be groundless, unless theygot the keys of everyone in the chain, all of the folks that I talk to, allof the folks that everyone I talk to, etc. Several questioners asked if any will met criteria #5.Miles Smid described a trick for meeting Criteria #5, if you encrypt the session key with your own public key, in addition to the key of your destination, and if you have escrowed your private key with an Escrow Agent, then nearly any approach meets criteria #5. "7. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall usean unclassified encryption algorithm with a key length notto exceed sixty-four (64) bits." This is really aimed at session keys, or at least non-RSA keys. I suggestedthat they really needed some wording that make it clear. He said that the 64-bit key limit is not meant to restrict RSA keys to64-bits, but rather to restrict the session keys that are encrypted usingRSA. Unspoken was the assumption that the 2000 bit RSA secret key would have to be escrowed. "8. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall notprovide the feature of multiple encryption (e.g., triple-DES)." He pointed out that the wording used to say "prevent" and now just says"not provide". He acknowledged that "prevent" was impossible. "9. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shallinteroperate only with key escrow cryptographic functions inproducts that meet these criteria, and shall notinteroperate with the cryptographic functions of a productwhose key escrow encryption function has been altered,bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered inoperative." Brooks said that this was intended to allow multiple modes, such ascompatibility with other encryption schemes. Of course, he said, the othermodes are subject to export restrictions. Somewhere in the discussion, Ed Appel took over for Brooks. Appel is"Director of Counter Intelligence Programs, National Security Council, TheWhite House" He was introduced as FBI. Ed Appel: the LEA�s are very interested in Criteria #5 (two ended decryption) as they have more than 100 international offices. There were some interesting (and bad IMHO) implications of interoperability.I'll cover them more in the next section Interoperability Issues Part 2 of three hasn't been written, it is supposed to address the issues related to interoperability. I decided it was better to get this part out than to wait. Key Escrow Agent Entity Criteria Geoff G. says that the discussions on agent criteria are simply a follow-on to the main criteria #3.The criteria themselves have been spam'd to the list.They are also available at url:http:/www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/nist/escagent.html There was a lot of reactions to the SECRET clearancerequirement, which they claimed was to handlesecure investigations (e.g. FISA). The logic is that since some investigations are classified,and since you can't even see a classified document unless you have a proper clearance, each Key Escrow Agent Entity,must have at least one properly cleared employee. Thiswas not a popular requirement. David Lesher asked a series of questions concerning the requirement that the Key Escrow Entity employ a person with a SECRET clearance. They included: what agency will issue the clearance? Who will authorize for the BI (background investigation)? Who will pay for it? Who does the existing RBOC clearances? Geoff dodged nearly all of them. He acknowledged that "they" will have to pay, but made no effort to define who "they" are. Geoff said that they may want legislation support for protecting against illegal release of keys, failure to release, etc. A fair number of the agent criteria would be consideredprofessional business practice (no single point offailure, dual locations, etc.) if you thought thatescrowing keys was a good thing. This is actually the same product that Bill talked about in September when he worked for National Semiconductor. It was impressive then (private keys are NOT escrowed, only session keys, etc.) and is still not approved for export. Bill talked about "information owners," they ultimately decide which security systems get deployed "in spite of various government requirements around the world." He said that "if rational key escrow systems are not offered, or do not adequately protect their information, owners will use unescrowed encryption from whatever sources available (Germany, et al)." Bill talked about a UK University (Royal Holloway) study on UK/European needs for key escrow. He said that there was a lot of overlap with the NIST criteria, but that there were criteria that were judged as totally unacceptable. The first and loudest finding was: "the use of the scheme should provide visible benefits to the user." This begs the obvious question, what visible benefits to the user does GAK bring? Two other interesting findings in the study were: An entity with a warrant should not be able to fabricate false evidence." Abuse by either side should be detectable by the other. He suggested that these criteria be added to the NIST list of 10. Bill went on to look at the NIST criteria. He said, concerning Criteria #3 (agents certified by US Government or reciprocal agreement), that "this is a show stopper!" because: no reciprocal agreements exist today, anywhere. what about countries where justice systems are different, and what about where "these agreements are not desirable (e.g. Nigeria, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Poland, etc.)? even for NATO countries, agreements will be different (Germany has data privacy laws, in Greece), or we may not want to be reciprocal (in Greece, the government likes to bug the opposition) He also says that Criteria #7, 64-bit keys, is unacceptable. CE Infosys currently sells a PCMCIA (PC Card) encryptor that does triple-DES at T1 speeds. TIS uses it, and sells it in the US. [as an aside, I was told that they can import and resell them, but when one breaks, TIS can�t ship it back to Germany for repairs. Sigh.] Sweet had two recommendations: develop a tiered crypto policy, with hardware and software under differing levels of rules, allow a pilot project, where TIS can sell VPN (virtual private networks) using strong encryption. A VPN is the use of the Internet as a private network for a corporation by adding appropriate firewalls, encryption, etc. It seems to me that while TIS' CKE doesn't meet the criteria, it could be made to, with a few changes.They've have to change the design to allow GAKfor any one target. (Criteria #5) This would meanfor generating one DRF (ie., LEEF) for each recipient as well as for the sender (as opposed to just for the sender) The neat thing about CKE is that each LEEF holds only the session key -- so you never give away your private key. (I think the govenmentreally expects that we'll be willing to escrow our private keys. Fat chance!) But this is a bit of a catch 22, because to follow all the criteria, you can't stop there. For each encryption, you generate a DRF for the sender and each recipient For each DRF generated, you must have and check a certificate chain for the chosen DRC and refuse to encrypt unless all recipients and the sender have validly certified (ie., USGovtapproved) DRC public keys. Each receiving application must refuse to decrypt unless every other recipient and the sender have validly certified DRCpublic keys. This gets into the interoperabilityissues that I need to write up... I don't know how they can meet the revised #6. Itseems to be designed specifically to break CKE. To get govie approval, each DRC needs to meet all thekey escrow agent entity criteria. I'm really not atall convinced that it is actually practical. This issad, because CKE is obviously designed with the spiritof the government at heart, with just some modificationsto make it marketable. Guess TIS needs an Ireland office too. Ken Mendelson of TIS Ken gave a solid presentation describing how all of the Government�s need for data about key escrow agents could be met with a commercial "vendor registration" approach instead of a Government mandated "certification" scheme. This would be in keeping with the current "spend less money, have less government bureaucratic rules" political climate. I have copies of his slides, I�d rather not type them in. With any luck, he�ll put them up on the TIS web site url: http://www.tis.com Dorothy Denning of Georgetown University Dorothy Denning gave a presentation based upon an article that will be published in the March 96 Communications of the ACM. It analyzes currently available products (and vapor products) and sees how well they meet Criteria #5. It says that eight of the sixteen approaches that she surveyed currently meet Criteria #5. She lists her web page as http://www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning, but as of Sunday 12/10, the text is not available. Melanie Janin, US Council for International Business Ms. Janin�s speech presented the US Council for International Business� comments on GAK. They are a NY based trade group, representing 300 clients. They don�t like GAK. She called for a coherent policy on all encryption. Major topics in the presentation include: free choice open to the public international acceptance flexibility of implementation User key management Key escrow (where they "embrace key escrow as one possible method of managing encryption keys.") Liability Ed Scheidt, Tecsec Presented both comments on the criteria and his company�s VEIL and Export VEIL Version 2.0 products. He raised a number of points, including: how do we protect our commercial information unless we have the best cryptography? we need "constructive key management technology" to manage keys, key splits, and different algorithms for extended data separation. solution must address issues such as international trust in a key escrow. He said that his "Export VEIL 2.0" product meets "the intent of 11/95 export criteria today." Daniel Weitzner of CDT Mr. Weitzner agreed to shorten his presentation so that he could yield some time to VTW. He opened by pointing out that while the schedule had both him and Jerry Berman were supposed to talk, Jerry was too busy to make the meeting. "Jerry is out defending pornographers, so I�ll be here defending terrorists." I expect that his text will be on CDT�s webpage, url: http://www.cdt.org. I�ll just enter the key points. The first thing he said is that "this is the wrong forum" and that "the [NIST] process will not work." He proposed a open, privately sponsored forum to develop alternatives that will work. "The NIST proposal will not provide adequate security, privacy, promote secure communications worldwide, or guarantee user privacy." Major issues are: Inadequate security No viable policy framework for the long-term Hinders the deployment of globally interoperable secure systems not necessarily voluntary not viable in the marketplace no constitutional privacy protections will not meet the needs of law enforcement, since it will "not deny criminals or terrorists access to strong encryption, the stated objective of the policy." Shaber Safdar, Voters Telecommunication Watch Described the results of an Internet-based, non-scientific survey that the VTW recently made. Not surprisingly, those who replied were overwhelmingly against the NIST proposal. I don�t have the slides, but VTW has a website with most of their information. The url is http://www.vtw.org There were 26 respondents to the survey. 24 out of 26 said that they would never buy products with law enforcement access. 16 out of 24 are already using security products. He described a Technology Pledge that VTW is presenting to politicians (available at url: http://www.vtw.org/pledge/) and stated that Rep. Ronald Wyden (D-OR) signed the pledge with pro-freedom, pro-market answers. David Sobol, EPIC As expected, EPIC doesn�t like much about the NIST proposal. Their comments are on their web page, url:http://www.epic.org/crypto/EPIC_Statement.html A key statement is "Given the reality that users are unlikely to adopt key escrow systems on a voluntary basis, we believe that the current policy will result in the eventual prohibition of non-escrowed products. Indeed, documents released to EPIC under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reveal that NSA and FBI concluded nearly three years ago that �Technological solutions such as they are, will only work if they are incorporated into all encryption products.�" Major points Public comment is frequently solicited but never heeded. Relevant information has not been released. The proposal conceals the attempt to expand wiretapping capability As a result, EPIC proposes the following Policy Recommendations Relax export controls on encryption and permit the free flow of encryption products across national borders Withdraw FIPS 185 (the Clipper standard for voice, fax,... and low speed data networks in the federal government) Remove "cryptology" from items that may be classified ... under executive order Do not fund the Telephone Carrier Compliance Program (the "Digital Telephony" proposal) Do not permit the use of classified algorithms for public networks Examine the activities of the National Security Agency ... since passage of the Computer Security Act of 1987. NOTE: during Mr. Sobel�s discussion, a FBI representative sitting at the head table said that the issues addressed by key escrow are "not just wiretapping, they include search and seizure of all stored media." I was not able to identify the person. He was sitting at Ed Appel�s seat, but did not have a namecard. No one sitting near me recognized him either. Padgett Petersen, Lockheed Martin Noted Internet personality, Padgett Petersen took a rarely held position, he spoke as a Security officer of Lockheed Martin, rather than speaking as a private net-citizen. He said that "these criteria are acceptable and can be made to work." He also said that "without US agreements, there is no reason to be concerned with export." Lockheed Martin was looking forward to participating in using and buying the escrowed products that will hit the market as a result of this process. Robert Hollyman, Business Software Alliance Mr. Hollyman said that "the facts are clear, companies are unanimous against" the NIST proposal. His members agree that: security is critical 40 bit is not viable the 1992 government review requires a change in policy. He recommended: immediate approval of DES or equal strength alternative for export. encourage companies to build encryption software by submitting code to NIST (under non-disclosure) for review add two bits ever three years to allowable key lengths in recognition of Moore�s law. He called this a COCA allowance (cost of cracking algorithms). removal of restrictions on interoperability because they are artificial and antithetical to the Global Information Infrastructure. He stated that the current criteria are vague, and will take years for approval. Yet he notes that in industry, the average life cycle of software is 18 months. Alex McIntosh, PC Security PC Security sells key management systems. Shell is a customer. He addresses a couple of areas that his commercial customers ask. The first question is "why encrypt?" He said that the answer is to protect confidential data. These data include email, PC files, and archival data. This leads to the obvious question, why use key management? The two separate answers are to have operational backup and to allow compliance with internal and external law enforcement. He said that he has a surprise for the NIST folks concerning key escrow agents. The corporate customer is the key escrow agent. Other key observations: Companies, such as Shell, often do business in countries where they can not trust the government. Shell handles over a million email messages a day. This defines engineering requirements for any system to meet. Liability is a huge issue, and the amounts are huge. Geologic information, market strategies, etc. are worth staggering amounts of money. The "US Government can NOT cover Shell�s liabilities." Doug Miller, Software Publishers Association Mr. Miller said that his members need immediate relief from the current encryption export policies. "our members are poised, but cannot leap, because of the barriers that U.S. cryptographic policy continues to impose." He wants to be able to export 56-bit DES. His position paper says, "we believe the discussion should also include assessment of the exportability of products employing the DES algorithm. DES-strength (56-bit) products can compete with 179 foreign products (80 of which are software products) that employ DES. Liberalization of the export restrictions of software with encryption capabilities is essential if U.S. companies are to compete with strong, widely available non-escrowed products." Viktor Hampel, Hampel Consulting Proposed "a �Consumer Protection Act for Digital Products� to support electronic commerce and to control the increasing abuse and lack of security on the national information highways." A copy can be obtained from Hampel Consulting, 1515 Jefferson Davis Highway, Crystal Square Suite 913, Arlington VA 22202-3312. In his remarks, Mr. Hampel said that trust is important between business. Business worries about issues as varied as what accountability is in the system and how much is the per minute interest on a billion dollar money transfer? These cause business to need solutions that NIST hasn�t raised. He recommended that a public key infrastructure be included into the Uniform Commercial Code. Closing comments. Mike Nelson noted that the meeting had some time for floor questions. He was asked what is the timeframe for finishing the process. He danced, saying that promising a fixed date for policy decisions is bad for your career, but thought it would be done in a couple of months. Someone asked about the "Personal Use" export process (the one that will allow you to export PGP on a laptop computer for personal use, and that was promised for "in a couple of weeks" at the September NIST meeting). They said that it is about to go to the Federal Register, and should be available within weeks. Nelson was asked about foreign escrow agents. He said that "if there exists bilateral diplomatic agreements, then the US will allow specification of Foreign Escrow agents." [Of course, no such agreements exist now.] Ed Appel of the White House said that the intent is to make export "as easy as 40-bit" is under the existing policies. The existing export policies will continue. He also said "so far, we are only controlling export" and that "the government has very strong cryptography available to them, so they are not worried about export." He said they hope to control export in two ways, first by applying the combined purchasing power of the US Government to encourage the market, and by controlling export. After the meeting closed, I invited both Mike Nelson and Ed Appel to the next DC Cypherpunks meeting. Somehow I expect it when they declined. But theyboth said they were interested in future meetings.We'll see if they were just being polite. Who is Who amongst the Government folks Ed Appel's card says Director of CounterIntellegence Programs National Security Council The White House He is clearly a very smart law enforcement guy. Geoff Greiveldinger is listed in the agenda as being with "U.S. Departmentof Justice." He is clearly very high up in the organization. All ofthe examples he gives are domestic, so he is probably FBI instead of NSA.He also constantly refered to "equipment" instead of software. Mike Nelson's card says Michael R. Nelson, PhD. Special Assistant, Information Technology Executive Office of the President Office of Science and Technology Policy OEOB (Old Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds) He is a geophysist by degree. An impressive politician. Ed Roback works at NIST. He coordinatedthese meetings. After the meetings, a number of us kidded himabout "comming out" and admiting that he really isonly doing this because NSA insists. Miles Smid works at NIST. He is rumoured to havebeen the brains behind the design of the Clipper system. He knowsa lot about cryptography. Other rumours say he learned aboutCryptography while employed at NSA. Pat's Opinions The meeting was in general a repeat of September's meeting, and similarmeetings that have been going on for years. Both sides talk past eachother. I think this has degenerated into a parallel with the abortiondebate. There is no common ground. The biggest items that I heard was the admission by Geoff G. that we do have "the right to hold your own keys." This admissionmeans that they know they have no expectation that outlawingunescrowed encryption is constitutional. This, sadly, doesn't meanthat they won't try. What I think it means: I believe that the government deeply wants to restrict domestic use ofstrong encryption, but they have no legal justification for doing so.They can't expect that they will get it if they go to Congress. So theyare attempting an end-arround using the export criteria, which theydo control. They hope that the pain of having multiple versions will beso high that no vendor will bother, and all we'll have is crippledsoftware. The usual civil liberties lobby folks (CDT, EPIC, etc.) want tohold their own, industry sponsored meetings to develop workable systems. I think that the real key is for everyone, worldwide to insist onboth strong crypto and interoperability. The Germans are alreadywriting fine software and making fast hardware. Microsoft and Netscapecan easily afford to do some of their development offshore. If the productssell and are deployed, it won't matter what the govies want.

The New York Times, March 25, 1996, p. D5. By Denise Caruso Copyright (c) 1996, New York Times, All Rights Reserved. The current uproar over the Internet is about smut and whatcan be made public on the global computer network. But thenext public-policy tangle will be about what we're allowedto keep secret. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group from both houses ofCongress introduced versions of legislation called theEncrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996. This bill,which outlines the proper use of encryption technologiesfor privacy and security, is by far the most critical pieceof Internet legislation yet introduced. Encryption uses a mathematical key to scramble andunscramble digital messages so they can be read only bytheir intended recipients and not by human or electronicsnoopers. Legislation about this powerful technology isespecially important when viewed in light of two lawsalready on the books. One of these, the Digital Telephony Act, signed into law in1994, allows Federal law-enforcement agencies to update thetelephone network with the most pervasive surveillanceequipment in history. The other, the freshly signed Communications Decency Act,bans "indecent" material from the Internet. It is a lawthat many legislators seemed to feel was on shaky groundeven as Congress was passing it. A constitutional challengeto the law is currently being heard in Federal DistrictCourt in Philadelphia. Though the encryption bill as written is receivingqualified support from industry and civil libertarians,some worry that changes made in committee could make thebill too restrictive, completing a triumvirate of BigBrother legislation that would give law enforcement theability and rationale to monitor all the electronicmessages of citizens, leaving little or no recourse forprivate or secure communication. Such restrictions threaten to suffocate the Internet. Asnew users and businesses flock daily to the Internet, theirneed to protect confidential business data and messagesbecomes a key issue in making the Net safe enough to beuseful. Computer security experts say that many of today'sproblems on the Net -- minors getting access topornography, security breaches of corporate data, the needto prove one's identity -- could be solved by usingencryption. Today, using encryption of any kind is still perfectlylegal inside the United States. Historically, it was mostlyused to protect secret military communications, so thetechnology is still classified as munitions -- the samethreat to national security as a boatload of artilleryshells. Thus any products containing encryption are subjectto strict export controls. Law-enforcement and national security officials say thatwidespread use of strong encryption would enable terroristsand organized-crime syndicates to communicate withimpunity. They say export control is the only way to keepthis genie in its bottle, at least when it comes toforeign, not domestic crime. In addition, security experts have persuaded the ClintonAdministration to propose an encryption method called "keyescrow" that would give the Government access toinformation even after it had been encrypted. Key-escrowsystems generate a decrypting key that is held by a trustedthird party. When law-enforcement agents show up with acourt warrant, the trustee hands over the key to unlock themessage. So far, the Clinton Administration's proposals, whichinclude a key-escrow system called Clipper have beenuniversally reviled by both civil libertarians and thecomputer industry, which claims it stands to be deprived ofup to $60 billion annually by the year 2000 because ofexport controls. They argue that any country today can makeand sell encryption products stronger than what can belegally exported from the United States and that peoplewon't use a system like key escrow because it has abuilt-in security compromise. One defender of key-escrow policy is Dorothy Denning, aprofessor of computer science at Georgetown University anda consultant to the military industry. She argued in aletter to Senator Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont --one of the sponsors of the new legislation -- that such asystem was vital to public safety and security. James Barksdale, president of the Netscape CommunicationsCorporation, whose popular Web-browser software hasbuilt-in encryption capabilities, called Ms. Denning'ssolution a "stopgap measure." "Key escrow is an unworkable idea, and we do not supportit," Mr. Barksdale said. "Key escrow will be defeated justlike Prohibition was defeated by bathtub gin -- all it tookwas a big bag of sugar and a long weekend." Policy watchdogs like the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, bothoutspoken advocates for privacy rights and due process,agree that the bill is headed in the right direction. Itdoes not dictate the use of a key escrow system, easesexport controls for "mass market" products (likeNetscape's), prohibits any restriction on the domestic useor sale of encryption, and provides a "personal use" policyfor American travelers who use encryption while outside thecountry. But the bill is sure to face a fight as it moves throughthe House and the Senate, and the key-escrow andexport-control proponents marshal their experts. David Farber, a professor of computer science at theUniversity of Pennsylvania and a board member of theElectronic Frontier Foundation, says encryption policyalways turns into "a religious discussion" between thosewho fear terrorism and those who want to live without fearof constant surveillance. But, he adds, if you take privacy discussions to thepeople, their attitudes are pretty clear. " If you ask theAmerican public what they think of national I.D. cards, forexample, a huge percentage are opposed to them," he said."Why? They're not hiding anything. They just don't want theGovernment to have that type of power." [End] Back to Pat's page on the December 5 NIST Clipper 2 meeting. Back to Pat'sClipper II page.

Industry Group Rebuffs U.S. On Encryption By John Markoff The campaign by the Clinton Administration to create a standard for data encryption acceptable to industry, civil liberties and law enforcement groups broke down yesterday when a group including some of the nation's most powerful technology companies rejected a compromise proposal. The aim is to set a policy that meets the needs of electronic commerce as well as the concerns of the National Security Agency and other Federal offices that are opposed to the proliferation of data-coding software, feeling it will make it impossible for them to gather intelligence overseas. The Administration offered a compromise plan and had been seeking comment from the public. But the industry coalition said yesterday that it found the Government unwilling to compromise. Thus, the group of 37 companies said, it would formulate its own policy proposal to present to the White House and to Congress in the next six months. High-technology industries want a data-coding standard secure enough that both businesses and overseas customers could use it for sensitive financial and business correspondence. They seek a longer and more powerful encryption key than the Government is willing to grant, and object to Government demands that law enforcement agencies have "back-door" access to such transmissions that would allow them to intercept coded messages. The letter is signed by several of the country's leading computer, software and on-line companies, among them America Online, Apple Computer, AT&T, Eastman Kodak I.B.M.'s Lotus Development division, MCI Communications, Microsoft, Novell, Oracle Sybase and Tandem Computers. On Aug. 17, the Administration proposed a liberalization of export-control procedures for "key escrow" software products, or those providing law-enforcement access. "The current policy directive also does not address the need for immediate liberalization of current export restrictions," the letter said "Such liberalization is vital to enable U.S. companies to export state-of-the-art software products during the potentially lengthy process of developing and adopting a comprehensive national cryptography policy."

Feedback welcome. Language Wars Considered Harmful Many folks within AMS think that Smalltalk is "the AMS Standard."This is simply not true. What is true is that the first version of Object Core was written in Smalltalk, and some of the early OO work at AMS was written in one or another flavor ofSmalltalk. However, AMS uses lots of tools to build systems. Popular tools used by AMS include: C++ PowerBuilder Visual Basic plain old C Cobol There is currently a large effort to build C++ ObjectCore. The first release was shipped to internal AMS projects on September 1, 1995. Abstract It is counterproductive to talk about comparing the languagesC++ and Smalltalk. We do not develop in a language, we develop ina programming environment. The programming environment includes obvious components such asthe language, compiler, debugger, editor, source code revision system.It also includes any existing program code such as copylibs, macros orpre-existing objects. Mathematician and Computer Sciencepioneer Alan Turing proved that all languages are effectively identical,their results can be mapped to a Turing machine. What is important tomanagers and developers is the effectiveness of the programming environment. I believe that the decision to select a specific tool is oftenflawed because the decision makers do not understand the impact oftwo critical factors: The selection of criteria and their weighting drives the selected solution without regard to the merit of the competing products. Oncethe criteria are selected, so it the answer. And The decision can only be made according to the facts that are trueat that single point in time. The rapid advances in the computer industryfrequently result in changes that obsolete the analysis within monthsof its completion. The global AMS community is slowly beginning to realize that the 1992 Smalltalk versus C++decision was not final. Most of the folks who took partin that decision process knew this then.This paper is a modest attempt to bring that discussion into a more current realistic perspective and distribute it to a wider audience. History AMS' decision to implement early OO systems in Smalltalk was strongly influenced Criteria for Comparing OO Languages by John Baker and Jim Talvitie, published internally on May 21, 1992.This paper presents criteria for analysis in the style of Milt Hess' famous Writing Decision Paper guide. Unfortunately, Baker and Talvitie's paper did more than just definethe criteria. It also attempted to make some judgment of the competingproducts. I believe that when there are large numbers of criteria (in thiscase, more than 20 pages of them), that the specification ofthe criteria and the evaluation of alternatives against those criteriashould be separate activities. As they said in their paper:     "In many cases, these guidelines are contradictory and more     elaborate criteria must be considered." With the paper, Baker and Talvitie presented the following criteria "as astarting point." Productivity Development Environment Simplicity Support for Distributed Processing Interoperability with other Languages Flexibility Portability Reusability of Code Performance Encapsulation Database Support Integration with GUI Tools Prepackaged Code Libraries Industry Acceptance. While I feel that this list has considerable duplication that results in biases[1], and that the ordering[2]implies a relative weight that is inconsistentwith AMS' real-world implementation experiences, this list can serveas a valid starting point. One critical problem is that some of these criteria are extremely timesensitive. The developments of the past three and a half yearshave not been kind to their assessments on criteria such as "Integration with GUI Tools," "Prepackaged Code Libraries," and"Industry Acceptance." There is a more fundamental problem with Baker and Talvitie's criteria and subsequent analysis: they suggest that execution performance is not themost vital criteria. As I pointed out at the time, AMS' experiencehas shown that run-time execution speed of the application is critical.Slow application are not accepted by users. Batch systems that take twentyhours to do the "nightly" processing are not accepted. Performance counts.It is not the only criteria, but it has always been vital for success,and will remain sofor the foreseeable future. It is not the language, it is the development environment Since it is impossible to evaluate languages, we have to evaluatespecific products that implement the language. I have professional experience[3] with: Microsoft Visual C++ Borland C++ ParcPlace VisualWorks Within this document, I will differentiate between artifacts of thespecific implementation, and differences that are architectural.Of course, as IBM's release of VisualAge (a true compiler fortheir Smalltalk implementation) shows, even the architectures can change. Performance In their paper's section on performance, Baker and Talvitie write: "One cannot easily compare languages on performance per se,since performance depends upon how the language is used. A badly performingsystem can be written in any language." These two sentences are true. But they imply that it is acceptableto ignore the essential performance differences between implementations.A more reasonable evaluation can be made if you ask a question similar to:"What are the differences between the execution performance of implementations that are identical except for the tools used? If we codetwo solutions to the same problem, and expend a similar amount[4] of tuning effort, can we expect to see significant differences?" This is the questionthat is critical when (and it is not a question of "if") the performance of the system becomesan acceptance issue. The performance characteristics of the implementations depends on a lot ofissues. I would not place nearly as much importance on "degree of supportfor static binding" as did Baker and Talvitie. This discussion assumesthat the algorithms are implemented with relative parity (not O(n^2) for one language against O(n ln n) for the other). For modern computer systems, I believe that the most importantcriteria are: Compatibility with the Operating Systems process/thread scheduling and management. Compatibility with the Operating System's virtual memory management(VMM) system. All AMS programs are huge. Virtual memory is effective when the program has good locality of reference. Compatibility with the advanced features of modern CPUs, includingparallel instruction execution, speculative execution, registerrenaming, etc. VisualWorks has a very arrogant approach to the Operating System. It essentially ignores it. It has its own scheduler and process implementation.Because of its "polling" approach to window and process scheduling,it is effectively impossible to multi-task VisualWorks with otherapplications on a single CPU, even when the operating system supportspreemptive multitasking. VisualWorks simply consumes 100% of the availableCPU. The stories of folks expecting to support many users with X-Terminalson a Unix system and discovering the feature that a practical limit isthree or four images are legendary. It is unclear whether any OO development tool makes any provisions to consider compatibility with any VMM. All modern C++ compilers know to eliminate the considerable call/returnsetup overhead for inlined functions. For small functions, the resultingcode has better locality than it would if they were executed astraditional subroutines. Modern CPUs can only reach their impressive speeds when the code is tunedfor the specific characteristics of the CPU. Hand coded assembler is no longer the way to write fast code, only an optimizing compiler canperform the instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, and graph analysisfunctions that are needed to reach peak speed. My Smalltalk experience was with VisualWorks, an implementation of Smalltalk that"compiles" source code into "byte-code" which is a machine independentencoding that is more compact and faster to execute than pure source code.This approach was called "p-code" by the UCSD Pascal system. A similarapproach is used by Sun Microsystem's JAVA language. Regardlessof the quality of the virtual machine, the execution time will notapproach that of native, compiled code.There is simply no way that an interpreted language's virtual machinecan perform the required optimizations. The Intel Pentium Pro has a nine stage pipeline. Only when all nine stagesare consistently filled can it approach its performance potential.With the small size of OO routines (in either language) therewill be processor stalls even if all of the functions of the routinewere converted into optimal assembly instructions. The optimization mustlook at larger units of work.Modern CPU performance requiresoptimizing compilers. Note: this is an implementation issue, not a language issue. VisualWorks, JAVA, and UCSD Pascal are three separate languages.Additionally, I've been told that IBM's VisualAge Smalltalk actuallyproduces code that is compiled into true, optimizable, machine instructions. With the benefit of hindsight Let's revisit the three that have not aged well. They are: Integration with GUI Tools Prepackaged Code Libraries Industry Acceptance. and look at them in some detail.In 1992, when the paper was written, C++ had someimpact into the Unix world, but the Unix world wasstill populated by large, expensive multi-user systems and high-endworkstations.In the PC world, C++ was virtually invisible,GUI development was done in C using the Windows SDK -- hardly an OO environment. Today, the picture is completely changed. While thequantitative lead in PC GUI development is held by tools such asVisualBasic and PowerBuilder, serious work is done with C++, specificallyMicrosoft's Visual C++. Integration with GUI Tools In 1992, C++ GUI tool integration was essentially non-existent.Today, there are essentially no differences in the ease of design andimplementation of GUI code between thecurrent Visual C++ (release 4.0) and Smalltalk. One could even argue that a complete switch has occured due to Visual C++'ssupport for VBX controls. There is a rich market of third partyproducts that make GUI building in both Visual C++ and VisualBasicmuch more productive than the language products themselves. Prepackaged Code Libraries Code Libraries for C++ are standardized today in a wayfew could have foreseen in 1992. Then, Baker and Talvitie accurately characterized it as "fairly chaotic." Today, the class libraryfor mainstream C++ programmers is Microsoft's MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes). I'm not about to try to defend MFC's many warts here, that would be clearly out of scope for this document. Rather, we need to simply observe the market acceptance of MFC. It is offeredby Microsoft for Windows 3.1x, Windows NT, Windows 95, and for the Macintosh.It is licensed by several competing compiler vendors including Watcom andSymatec. It has been ported to the X-Windows/Unix world by Bristol Technologies,and is currently being ported to VMS by Digital.(For a mini-review of MFC/Bristol's approach, follow this link) Additionally, it is no longer necessary to pick only one class library.ANSI strings are now part of C++, as are the Standard Template Librarycollections. These are supported by all modern C++ compilers. The issueof code libraries has been replaced by worries about Microsoft'sdominance. The concept of focusing on the class library may be outdated. This view thatthe libraries are important is traditional for pure OO languages. Microsoft's OLE is designed to use a different pattern: reusecomponents that stay encapsulated in separate executables. This allowsreuse between programs written in dissimilar languages. Given the difficultyof reaching consensus on language choise (see Baker and Talvitie or even thisdocument as proof), perhaps code libraries are obsolete. I expect that until a totally new programming model, such as JAVA onthe Web, can displace Microsoft's overwhelming popularity, MFC is the answerwhen the question is "what class library do I use for my C++ work?" Industry Acceptance. Baker and Talvitie wrote"At the moment, it seems clear that C++ has wider acceptance, especially, butnot only, in the Unix world." I believe that in today's PC world, MS Visual C++ has vastly greater acceptance than all flavors of Smalltalk combined. Baker and Talvitie's closing statement in their paper is "The Ultimateability of either Smalltalk or C++ to penetrate thecommercial world of AMS clients will probably be decided by factors otherthan pure technical merit." I have to give them credit for accuratelyforecasting the future. It is Microsoft's marketing power, together witha couple of lucky breaks (such as adding VBX support into Visual C++)that have changed the penetration numbers. For now, Smalltalk isrelegated to niche markets. Additional criteria to consider In addition to the criteria suggested by Baker and Talvitie, I suggestthat any evaluation that takes place now consider the following: Compliance with the native Operating System look and feel. Windows 95 hasa very different look-and-feel. While acceptance has been slow, in a fewyears it will be on our customer's desks. VisualWorks did not providean accurate Windows look and feel in the four years between Windows 3.0 release (May 1990) and when I stopped developing using the package (December1994). How long will our customers be willing to delay requiring Win95? Timeliness of the vendor's acceptance of new industry developments.Microsoft's pushes into new technology for component reuse,such as OLE, OLE automation, anddistributed OLE, will be expected by our customers.When will the toolsuite support these developments? Cost premium afforded skilled staff with experience with the tools.Staff experienced with OO tools are expensive. What level of premium are we willing to pay? How do we trade off these premiums againstvendors' claims of increased productivity? Dead Issues Issues that only fan the flames rather than showing light. Over the past few years, the C++ community has liberally copied good ideas that were once exclusively the property of Smalltalk. C++ has run-time-type-interface (RTTI) which provides the delayed bindingthat Smalltalk provides. Even before it supported RTTI, Microsoft's Visual C++provided a dynamic runtime facility.The class browser of Microsoft's Visual C++ 4.0is comparable to that on VisualWorks. Several companies offer products thatreplace the C++ memory management system with a Smalltalk-stylegarbage collection system. For example, look atGeodesic system's Similarly, the speed of the edit-compile-link-debug cycle has improveddramatically in C++ implementations with the use of precompiled headers, incremental compilation and incremental linkers. Smalltalk, like other interpreted languages used to have a substantial advantage. I recently timedthe compile-link-debug cycle time at less than six seconds for a Windows program using MSVC4.0 onmy old 486/66. The program used all of the huge Win32 header heirarchy, which takes a verylong time to compile from scratch. Smart implementations have removed thisas an effective criteria for discrimination. One prime issue used to be that C++ supported multiple inheritance (MI).This issue has considerably less interest today. MIis at best a very dangerous tool. I've worked on two projects thattried to use MI, both pulled it out as unworkable. An Issue that I wish were dead: portability Portability is a major issue. It is much more of an issue forAMS than for most other software developers because of the natureof our client base. A large percentage of AMS' customers arein one of the following groups: The US Federal Government; Telecommunications firms; and Educational Institutions. These three groups are about the only computer users in existance that stillthink that Unix is viable on the desktop. The majority of the restof the industry simply puts a version of Windows on the desk and moveson. Portability is expensive. It is easy for the customers to specify, andit is very hard to deliver. Portability of the desktop application is an area that Smalltalk claimed toown when Baker and Talvitie's paper was written.And at a high level, VisualWorks Smalltalk delivered. It was possibleto take a Smalltalk image (program) file, move it to a new platform, andexecute it. There were very few changes needed, demonstrably better thanany C or C++ implementation that I've worked with. This portability came at a significant price, primarily performanceand compliance with the native look-and-feel. As mentioned above, VisualWorks only approximated the native look and feel of the underlyingoperating system. The application worked the same on all platforms. It never matched theexpected look and feel of other, native applications. This became a seriousacceptance criteria when FMS was delivered to Columbia University. The current C++ Object Core development team is committed to deliveringidentical functionality on three platforms, Sun Sparc with Solarias, HP PA with HP/UX, and Windows NT. While we don't have exact figureson the cost of writing, porting, testing, and maintaining the codebaseon the three platforms, I estimate it as at least 30% of the total projecteffort. I could believe that it has cost as much at 50% of the totalproject effort. What I can't tell is whether or not this increasein cost was worthwhile. In a year, I expect that the penetration ofWindows NT Servers will be significant. Would a decision to write only for Windows NT appear better then? Only time will tell. Where are we now, using the 30 month old criteria? In the interest of time, I haven't revisited every criteria. You can eitheraccept my quick assessment, or invent your own. You might evenbe able to convince me to change some of these. The fact that this document doesn't go into depth on a criteria doesn't meanthat it should be ignored. For example, I feel that the encapsulation that C++ compilersrequire for "private" functions and variables is much more powerfulthan the Smalltalk protocol of labeling a group of functions "private" andhoping that no programmer looks behind the curtain.

Conclusion It is counterproductive to talk about comparing the languagesC++ and Smalltalk. We do not develop in a language, we develop ina programming environment. The programming environment includes obvious components such asthe language, compiler, debugger, editor, source code revision system.It also includes any existing program code such as copylibs, macros orpre-existing objects. Given the competitive nature of the computer industry, rapid advancesare being made in the quality of development environments. We must be awarethat we are shooting at a moving target. Even this document is probablydated as it is written. After a few months pass, any product specificinformation will be outdated. The global AMS community is slowly beginning to realize that the 1992 Smalltalk versus C++decision was not final. Most of the folks who took partin that decision process knew this then.This paper is a modest attempt to bring that discussion into a more current and realistic perspective.By using the WWW, I hope to distribute it to a wider audience. Footnotes [1] For example, if the weighting is uniform, then by repeating areassuch as productivity, simplicity, and Integration with GUI toolsas three separate topics, they have three times the weight asa topic, such as performance, that is not repeated. If the weightingsare ordered more heavily towards the top of the list, since productivity isnumber one, and simplicity is number three, the effect is even stronger.Back to the text [2] I find the placement of Performance as 8th out of 14 aswildly inconsistent with AMS experience. And making IndustryAcceptance dead last would imply that we prefer to build everythingourselves -- hardly a prescription for reuse.Back to the text [3] I define professional experience as AMS paying me to write programs in a specific language.Back to the text [4] Here is an example of how criteria are interdependent.If one tool provides superior productivity, it is possible thatthe development will be done much more quickly, allowingfor a greater amount of tuning effort without exceeding thedevelopment budget. This assumes that we haven't alreadyspent the development savings elsewhere.Back to the text Copyright (c) 1995, Patrick Farrell, all rights reserved.

The key action was a two day longmeeting on key escrow and export regulations that took placeSeptember 6 and 7, 1995. It is my belief that this meeting was a staged presentation. Nearly every industry representative said that this was a fatally flawedidea. It was "a non-starter." The governmentrepresentatives said that they heard the comments, but insistedon proceeding. It is clear to me that the government intends that industry provide crippledencryption "for export." Never stated was the expectation that sinceindustry has repeatedly said that they want only one version worldwide of products, that Domestic products will be crippled. The testimonyof Geoff Greiveldinger (from the US Justice Department) was focusedon domestic crime -- if the meeting was about export, why the focuson domestic areas? It is equally clear from representatives of IBM, Compaq, DEC, Lotus, andothers that I talked to, that crypto product development willsimply move offshore. Ireland, Israel, and Germany already havesignificant experience in developing commercial software. It is depressing to hear our Commerce department chasing technology andjobs overseas. I believe that strong encryption is necessary for security, privacy, andauthentication for client/server systems. It wasn't needed for mainframe systems.It is critical for client/server systems. But todate, few client/server systemsare operational, and those have only modest size. As a result,the need for security, privacy, and authentication is notrecognized by the purchasers of software systems. It will take somepublic failures before the need is recognized and accepted. With thepolicies that the Clinton Administration is pushing onto a very reluctant industry, the development of these critical tools will occur outside the US.

CDT believes that the new proposal fails to provide adequate privacy protection, would effectively eliminate the domestic market for non-escrowed encryption applications, and is weighed too heavily toward the interests of the National Security Agency.The administration has proposed to relax export controls on cryptographic applications (both software and hardware) with key lengths up to 64 bits provided that:* The keys required to decrypt a message or file are escrowed with an   agent certified by the US government (including private entities)* The product does not decrypt messages or files encrypted with non-  escrowed products or products whose escrow mechanisms have been   altered or disabled.* As well as eight other criteria (the proposal is attached below).NEW PROPOSAL FAILS TO ADHERE TO CRITERIA IN GORE LETTER TO CANTWELL.In a July 1994 letter to then Representative Maria Cantwell, Vice President Gore announced that the Administration intended to re-examine its cryptography policy. The Gore letter, which was widely viewed as an abandonment of the Clipper Chip Government Key Escrow scheme, pledged to develop a policy framework that would promote the development of encryption systems that would meet the following criteria:* Implementation in hardware of Software* Public, Unclassified Algorithms* Voluntary* Forth Amendment privacy Safeguards* Statutory liability rules to protect users* Multiple Escrow AgentsOn hearing that the Administration had set out to develop a new encryption policy based on the principles outlined in the Gore letter, the Center for Democracy and Technology was guardedly optimistic that a genuine policy breakthrough was possible.  However, having had the opportunity to review the current proposal, every principle, except the first (software implementation) and second (public algorithms), outlined in the July 1994 letter is violated or, in one case, left in doubt, by the September 1995 policy statement.The September 1995 policy statement diverges from the July 1994 letter in the following critical respects.  In our view, these divergences represent fundamental defects in the proposed policy.* NOT VOLUNTARY:  The current proposal effectively compels all domestic   users to use key escrow systems if they ever intend to communicate   internationally.  Point 6 of the export criteria requires that an   exportable system must not interoperate with any system that non-  escrow systems.  Thus, in order for a user in the United States to   communicate with anyone who uses a United States-made system on the   Internet but outside of the United States, the American user must   employ a key escrow system.  Domestic users are not legally compelled   to use key escrow products, but the proposed policy forces, in   practice, all but the most insular Internet user toward a key escrow   system. Moreover, this proposal further illustrates that the   Administration seeks to use export controls to push the domestic use   of escrowed cryptography. A policy based on such compulsion can hardly   be called voluntary. * INADEQUATE SECURITY:  Point 1 precludes export of systems with key   lengths beyond 64 bits.  Though this key size is larger than what is   currently exportable, it is a level of security already judged   inadequate for some applications.  Given the rate at which computing   power increases, even a 64 bit key would be subject to attach before   long. Ironically, even the Clipper Chip provided a stronger (80 bit)   key length  The premise of the key escrow policy is to provide law enforcement   and national security agencies a "front door" to be used to decrypt   messages when the agency obtains proper legal authorization.  Yet, the   architects of the current policy apparently are not willing to trust   that key escrow systems will meet law enforcement needs inasmuch as   the key length limit suggests that the Administration is intent on   maintaining an extra-legal method of decrypting communications.  The   Gore letter contains no suggestion that key escrow systems would also   be subject to key length limits but the Administration seems to have   lost faith in its own proposal.  Such a half-hearted effort cannot be   the basis of a long-lasting policy.* NO PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR USERS OF ESCROWED SYSTEMS:  The ten export   principles make no mention of privacy safeguards which the Vice   President previously recognized as necessary to safeguard individual   privacy and Fourth Amendment principles.  Any escrow policy must   contain safeguards against abuse and statutory liability provisions   for the operators of private escrow systems.* FAILS TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY:  Points 6 and 10 of   the export criteria raise grave doubts as to the likelihood that the   current proposal will give rise to a secure global communications   environment.  Point 10 forces users in other countries (and their   governments) to accept United States-based escrow of all keys until   bilateral access agreements are entered into.  Such tactics seem   unlikely to produce satisfactory international agreements, and hold   global communications security hostage to the completion of such   agreements.NSA/ADMINISTRATION SEEK TO RUSH IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW POLICYThe NIST Key escrow conference was billed as an opportunity to begin a dialogue between the administration and industry on the new cryptography policy. However, as the conference began it quickly became apparent that many of the critical policy issues, including the 64 bit key length, interoperability with non-escrow products, and some requirements for key escrow agents (including whether individuals, corporations, and foreign entities are eligible) have already been decided. The Administrations attempt to rush many of the critical policy decisions drew sharp reaction from virtually all of the conference participants, including CDT, other public interest groups, and representatives from several major software and hardware manufacturers. Although the administration and NSA officials all indicated that they got the message, they still intend to publish a revised policy in the next 30 days for comment.INDUSTRY BALKSIndustry reaction to the new policy proposal was, with a few limited exceptions, decidedly negative. Both during formal presentations and in small group sessions, representatives from several of the largest hardware manufacturers and software publishers questioned whether the market would support products designed to adhere to the administration's proposal, particularly in light of the 64 bit key length limit.CDT believes that the administration must make every effort to accommodate the concerns of the public, civil liberties groups, software publishers, hardware manufacturers, users, and other interested parties before adopting any new national cryptography policy. The current proposal fails to address many of the critical concerns of public interest groups and industry, and should be abandoned.NEXT STEPSThe administration intends to published a revised policy within the next 30 days (October 7). CDT will closely monitor this issue and will inform you as it develops.PATHS TO RELEVANT DOCUMENTS:More information, including CDT's testimony from the NIST conference,other conference documents, etc. can be found at CDT's Crypto Issues Page:URL:http://www.cdt.org/crypto.html------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEW CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY9/1/95 Proposed Cryptography Policy for Software Key EscrowKey Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995Discussion Paper #3            Export Criteria Discussion Draft --           64-bit Software Key Escrow EncryptionAs discussed at the SPA/AEA meeting on August 17, 1995, theAdministration is willing to allow the export of softwareencryption provided that the products use algorithms with keyspace that does not exceed 64 bits and the key(s) required todecrypt messages/files are escrowed with approved escrow agents. On the same date, the September 6-7 key escrow issues meeting atNIST was also announced.  The two principal topics at the meetingwill be:  discussion of issues of exportability of 64-bitsoftware key escrow encryption and 2) desirable characteristicsfor key escrow agents. In order to help make most productive use of the limited timeavailable at the upcoming meeting and to better focusdeliberation, the following criteria are being distributed fordiscussion purposes.  Since it is important that final criteriabe clear, straightforward, consistent, and implementable, pleasereview these draft criteria and be prepared to discuss how they may be refined and made more specific.                            --- Draft Export Criteria ---for Software Key Escrow Encryption Software key escrow encryption products meeting the followingcriteria will be granted special export licensing treatmentsimilar to that afforded other mass-market software products withencryption.  1.    The product will use an unclassified encryption algorithm      (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to exceed 64 bits.2.    The product shall be designed to prevent multiple      encryption (e.g., triple-DES).3.    The key required to decrypt each message or file shall be      accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the product,      and such keys will be escrowed during manufacture in      accordance with #10.  If such keys are not escrowed during      manufacture, the product shall be inoperable until the key      is escrowed in accordance with #10.4.    The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include with      each encrypted message or file, in a format accessible by      authorized entities, the identity of the key escrow      agent(s), and information sufficient for the escrow      agent(s) to identify the key or key components required to      decrypt that message.5.    The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would      disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include      being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be      disabled by a static patch, (i.e., the replacement of a      block of code by a modified block).6.    The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted      by non-escrowed products, including products whose key      escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled.7.    The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's      encrypted information regardless of whether that user is      the sender or the intended recipient of the encrypted      information.8.    The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated      involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of      multiple decryption keys during the period of authorized      access.9.    In the event any such product is or may be available in the      United States, each production copy of the software shall      either have a unique key required for decrypting messages      or files that is escrowed in accordance with #10, or have      the capability for its escrow mechanism to be rekeyed and      any new key to be escrowed in accordance with #10.10.   The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only with      escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government or by      foreign governments with which the U.S. Government has      formal agreements consistent with U.S. law enforcement and      national security requirements.Note: Software products incorporating additional encryptionmethods other than key escrow encryption methods will beevaluated for export on the basis of each encryption methodincluded, as is already the case with existing products. Accordingly, these criteria apply only to the key escrowencryption method incorporated by a software product, and not toother non-escrowed encryption methods it may incorporate.  Forinstance, non-escrowed encryption using a key length of 40 bitsor less will continue to be exportable under existing exportregulations.------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CDT POLICY POST LISTCDT Policy Posts, which is what you have just finished reading, are the regular news publication of the Center For Democracy and Technology.

It caused a lotof grumbling amongst the attendees, as they were supposed to discuss it,without any prior chance to read or react to it. Here are two versionsof it, First, Anonymous Sample Solutions (HTML by PDF) and a simple ASCII version Sample Solutions (ASCII text by John Young) I have not seen an electronic version of the paper that I received. Itcontains the following paragraph: "Example Solutions to export criteria 5 and 6 are identified below to helpgive a better feel for approaches that implementors may take to satisfy the criteria. The information inthis paper is not intended to represent fail-safe, cookie cutter solutions tothe criteria, but only to generate more detailed discussions."

Individual systems may have distinct naming conventions, different meanings for similar data entities, differing time measurement schemes, and diverse uncertainty management schemes. The goal is to investigate a federated architecture that allows individual systems to retain autonomy and responsibility over data and knowledge, while still sharing information with the other members of the federation. Approach: The federation architecture consists of a Federation Manager tohandle the formulation, planning and processing of global queries,and Federation Interface Managers (FIMs) to serve as agents forlocal information systems, called federation constituents. Localusers have access to their respective local information systems,and perform the operations defined therein. Each FIM contains anobject-oriented specification of the data and services the localinformation system will provide to the federation. FIMs maycommunicate directly with each other, or may request assistancefrom the Federation Manager to resolve different types ofinconsistencies, specifically terminology, time units and temporaldata model inconsistencies, and inconsistencies in answers providedby different databases. The Federation Manager contains severalcooperating modules that help to resolve inconsistencies: anactive intelligent thesaurus to resolve semantic heterogeneity, atemporal mediator to resolve temporal inconsistencies arising fromdifferent temporal granularities in constituent databases, and aharmony agent the integrates conflicting information fromconstituent databases. Hardware_Software_Prototypes_Available: The Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Environment (KBSEE) hasbeen developed by Drs. Gomaa and Kerschberg under a NASA-sponsoredresearch project. This environment is used for the domain modelingportion of the I3 research. The KBSEE runs on Sun Sparcstationsunder Sun OS, and requires NASA's TAE user interface manager andCLIPS expert system shell, as well as IDE's Software throughPictures. NASA has installed the KBSEE at Goddard Space FlightCenter in Code 520 for evaluation. The key technologies beingexported are: 1) domain-independent tools for specifying domainmodels, and 2) knowledge-based tools to generate target systemspecifications from selected system features. Transitions: Process Engineer's Expert Advisor The KBSEE was used on a grant from the Virginia Center of Excellencefor Software Reuse and Technology Transfer, a Center of Excellencefunded by ARPA and located at the Software Productivity Consortium(SPC) in Herndon, Virginia. A domain model was specified for thefamily of software process models that can be "generated" from theEvolutionary Spiral Model (ESP) developed at SPC. The KBSEE wasused to specify the domain model and the Knowledge-basedRequirements Elicitation Tool, KBRET, assists a Process Engineer toselect the requirements of a particular project, and then generatethe process model and the activities best suited to the projectrequirements. Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) The KBSEE is being used to create a domain model of the EOSDIS Core System, under a contract with Hughes Applied Information Systems. The goal is to characterize the major components of the EOSDIS Core System (ECS) and then map the domain model to a client/server model that can drive a performance analysis model. Several information integration issues are also addressed; specifically EOSDIS must interchange data with other agengies such as NOAA, International Partners, and associated data centers. Information integration and interchange is important to the generation of EOS Standard Products as well as for supporting user-specified derived products. EOSDIS must support the concept of a federation of cooperating information systems. Center for Information Systems Integration and Evolution The Center for Information Systems Integration and Evolution is a new center at George Mason University which will focus on the important research and development issues confronting the nation in areas such as business process re-engineering, data, information and knowledge interchange, information integration in large-scale systems, and information systems evolution. We are witnessing the right-sizing and re-engineering of organizations to better address customer needs and to meet business imperatives for inserting information technology solutions. New architectures are being investigated which bring the computing resource to customers so as to capture information at its source, and to share that information as a corporate resource. Moreover, there is a need to address national challenges such as health care, advanced manufacturing technology, the national information infrastructure and crisis management, all of which require inter-disciplinary approaches to the problem, therefore bringing together domain experts as well as information-, computer- and software- scientists and engineers to create new information system paradigms. Large-scale systems require the integration and interchange of information from heterogeneous autonomous data systems. Examples are: the Logistics Anchor Desk involving collaborative planning among distinct agencies and the integration of information from multiple heterogeneous databases, the Human Genome Project, the Earth Observing System Data Information System (EOSDIS), and the Defense Information Systems Agency's efforts to integrate and evolve existing information systems. The Center's Director is Dr. Larry Kerschberg and the Associate Director is Dr. Hassan Gomaa. Please contact Dr. Kerschberg (kersch@gmu.edu) for more information. LookingForTransitionOpportunities: Larry Kerschberg participated in an ARPA Working Group to develop ideas for a new ARPA Initiative called the Logistics Anchor-Desk. The Working Group meeting was held in conjunction with ARPA Planning Initiative PI Meeting held at Tucson, Arizona, February 23-25, 1994. There has been considerable interest within the ARPA I3 community in our plan to provide independent agents that will interact with other systems to help them resolve information inconsistencies (and other possible services related to information uncertainty). Specifically, we have agreed to cooperate with the following projects: Project SIMS at ISI (Yigal Arens) Project CoBase at UCLA (Wesley Chu) Project at SRI (Xiaolei Qian) HonorsReceived: Journal Editorships: Larry Kerschberg, Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

CIA Headquarters are in Langley VA. Just off Rt 123 between McLean andthe George Washington Parkway. There is a big sign, you can't miss it. The sign was put up about 10 years ago. Before that, there was no sign, but everyoneknew where it was, and that was in the heavily guarded, unmarked compound. Offices in Roslyn VA. There are several ugly blue office buildings in Roslyn that are used as overflow office space. They havebeen in use at least since 1969. Offices in Vienna. I know they are there, but don't know which building.I know that folks working there hang out at the Vienna Inn, a dive bar.If you know, please mail me Offices in Reston. Ditto Offices in Lake Fairfax (outside Reston). Rumour has it that the CIAhas most of the building on Bussiness Circle that has prominent PRC signson it. I know that the guards are not PRC guards, and that PRC has onlya few floors. NSA HQ is clearly in Fort Meade MD. other offices?If you know, please mail me NRO there was a big deal made a year or so ago about the NRO's secretheadquarters that was being built as a defense contractor's officejust outside of Dulles Aiport. Other offices?If you know, please mail me DIA HQ is in Arlington VA, within a few blocks of the Pentagon. I'll haveto drive arround to get the exact spot next time I go to Whitey's.

Here's the "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto" I read at the September 1992founding meeting. It dates back to mid-1988 and was distributed tosome like-minded techno-anarchists at the "Crypto '88" conference andthen again at the "Hackers Conference" that year. I later gave talksat Hackers on this in 1989 and 1990. There are a few things I'd change, but for historical reasons I'lljust leave it as is. Some of the terms may be unfamiliar to you...Ihope the Crypto Glossary I just distributed will help. (This should explain all those cryptic terms in my .signature!) --Tim May ................................................... The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto Timothy C. Maytcmay@netcom.com A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy. Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation. The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies. The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy. Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property. Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences! .....................................................................Timothy C.

I was at the National Institute of Standards and Technology meetings inSeptamber on the export of "key escrow" cryptography software.The commercial vendors were united that there is no commercial market forescrowed communications. They stated there is a huge international marketlooking for cryptography-based security products. If these productscannot be developed and sold in the United States, there are able softwareengineers in Israel, Ireland, India, and other countries that will be gladto make and sell them.

The letters deepen an industry-government rift that began only days after federal officials unveiled an outline of what they hoped would be a palatable plan at an industry meeting in August. Two separate coalitions are criticizing the administration's draft proposal, which the government circulated on the Internet on Monday. Current export regulations prohibit companies froan sending overseas any encryption, or data-scrambling technology, that exceeds a certain degree of sophistication. The government argues that it needs to be able to peek at messages and files with proper court authorization -- to do its job of protecting U.S. citizens from terrorist groups and other malevolent organizations. In July, some French students demonstrated they could readily break the type of encryption technology that the U.S. government lets companies export. In August, the administration said it would let companies include more complex types of encryption, provided they pledged to entrust to an authorized agent a "spare key," or the means for unscrambling the information. Unlike early proposals in which the government said it would hold such keys, the administration is suggesting that companies and individuals would be able to select private keyholders, much the way people pick their banks. But after a brief honeymoon, industry and civil liberties groups began to find flaws with the details in the new proposals. This week's letters indicate that whatever fragile compromise the government had hoped it had found has grown even weaker. One coalition, pulled together by the Washington advocacy group Center for Democracy and Technology, includes about three dozen high-tech companies and associations. The group has promised to draft an alternative plan within six months. "There is a very serious message here: that national security can't be controlling the Internet," said Jerry Berman, executive director of the center. "There are other issues, global competitiveness and privacy, that need to be placed in the balance -- and the administration's policy doesn't do that." A second coalition of about 10 free-market and libertarian groups, led by another policy group, Americans for Tax Reform, plans to send their letter to Gingrich in the next day or two. The group contends the administration's encryption proposals are an encroachment on citizens' civil rights. The administration's proposals would not restrict tbe encryption technologies that people use within U.S. boundaries. But it would require that if they electronically send an encrypted message to parties outside the United States, a spare key must be stored with an authorized agency. "Even though we recognize [the administration] has worked hard on its proposals, it's not the right direction," said Rebecca Gould, director of policy at the Business Software Alliance, a trade association of software firms. "We've been in this [debate] since July 1994," she added, a long time for companies that churn out a new version of most products every 18 months. "That means lost sales for us and a loss of U.S. industry sales abroad." Back to Pat'sClipper II page.

When the Senate passed its ill-advised "Exon amendment" to the telecommunications bill last spring, which would criminalize the transmission of obscene, pornographic or "indecent" material on the Internet, the measure got an overwhelming 84 votes, many of them from senators who didn't understand the implications of the move. Only a few weeks later, the House went even more overwhelmingly the other way, voting 420 to 4 for an amendment (co-sponsored by Reps. Ron Wyden and Christopher Cox) that would bar the Federal Communications Commission from regulating cyberspace and would instead make it legally easier for commercial Internet providers to use their own technical tools to regulate questionable material. The contrast was the result of a burst of public discussion in which more technologically astute members, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, caught on to the disturbing fact that the kinds of far-reaching liability imposed by Sen. James Exon's formulation -- hastily adapted from an existing measure on telephone transmission -- would cripple practically any commercial Internet provider and effectively lame the new medium as a venue for moneymaking activity. Now these vastly different measures are in conference committee along with the rest of the telecommunications bill (in other areas of which, we remind readers once again, The Washington Post Co. has some interests). But the seeming clarity afforded by the House response to the Exon amendment and by Mr. Gingrich's appreciation of the need for untrammeled development of the new medium is nowhere to be seen. A letter from Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed, Phyllis Schlafly and other prominent spokesmen for the religious right is urging the conferees toward an Exon-style approach that's as destructive now as it ever was. The House bill also could end up including an amendment sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde that adds some criminal liability to the transmission of obscene (but not "indecent") images via the new technologies. The argument against "criminalizing" the transmission of "indecent" images via the Internet remains stark and simple, and it goes not to the awfulness of child pornography or even to the ability of parents to control what their children do on the computer (a wide variety of off-the-shelf technological filters now exist that let parents do this themselves) but to the impossibility of regulation by the electronic middleman industries that are developing. Commercial providers such as America Online continue to pass along millions of messages a day, the interactive "newsgroups" unfold quickly and internationally, and the kind of central filtering envisioned by would-be regulators erases the very quality that makes the Internet a live and promising medium -- its inexpensive accessibility. If the Internet were like a telephone system, there would at least be the possibility of identifying a specific "sender" and "recipient." On the Internet it's "receivers" who do the selecting of what to look at and where. Giving those recipients the tools they need remains the way to go. The conferees should resist the urge to censor cyberspace. Back to Pat'sClipper II page.

The study is likely to become the latest ammunition in the struggle between the administration and many U.S. high-tech companies and civil liberties advocates over how tightly the United States should control the export of sophisticated data scrambling, or encryption, technology. Both sides are likely to try to use the report to their advantage. U.S. businesses contend that they are losing market share to foreign competitors because they are not allowed to include the most sophisticated encryption technology in their software products. "The day we show lost market share [in the overall market for software] is the day that we start losing the whole ballgame," said Rebecca Gould, director of policy for the Business Software Alliance. The report, which was commissioned in late 1994 by the national security adviser and carried out by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration and the National Security Agency, aimed to assess the impact of encryption export controls. It assigns no dollar values to any sales lost by U.S. companies, but notes that there are many foreign-made encryption products available overseas. On the other hand, some of those products do not work well, the report says. Still, it cites evidence that U.S firms are not making significant progress in the business of selling encryption technology. In three countries -- Switzerland, Denmark and the United Kingdom -- market share for U.S. encryption products declined during 1994, the report said. Sources in 14 countries said that export controls "limit" U.S. market share, while those in another seven countries said such controls have "either no impact or no major impact." Although the report maintains that sources in "most" countries indicated that U.S. market share is "keeping pace" with overall demand, in many of the countries surveyed, "exportable U.S. encryption products are perceived to be of unsatisfactory quality." Today, a Washington-based policy group supported by a dozen major computer companies plans to release its own commentary on export encryptions, calling for the government to lift its export restrictions.

This isa short writeup of a summary. I'll post a longer version laterthis evening or early tomorrow morning. The meeting was hosted by Ed Roback of NIST, who quickly introducedMike Nelson of the White House. Mike is clearly a political guy.His handout says: "We believe that our proposal for exportable 64-bit keyescrow encryption meets these goals [the goals of VP Gore's letter to RepCantwell, July 20, 1994]." He said that the criteria describe a solution,but not the only solution. He said it does not preclude otherimplementations in the future. He anticipates that the State Departmentwill issue guidance based upon these criteria in "early 1996," and thatbetween now and then, any product that meets the criteria will be elegiblefor expidited approval. Of course, the existing (slow as molasass) processwill continue. I asked the first questions from the floor. The two questions were:(1) Is this meeting concerned solely with exportof software, or does it deal with controling domestic use of strongcryptography? and (2) since the 64-bit limit was severly criticized atthe Sept meeting, why is it still needed if there is also escrow? His answer was that there is "no intention to control domestic encryption"and on the 64-bit issue, that the government is "not certain it willwork." he says they "want to see it implemented and want to seehow it works" because 64-bit encryption is very strong. If the escrowdoesn't work, they don't want a lot of softare to be in widespread use. He said that they have studied the encryption that is supposed to be widelyavailable on the Internet. He said that viewed by crypto experts, notmuch is very good. He mentioned "two incidents" where Netscape hadweak implimentations. He feels that companies will not trust softwareover the 'net. that they "want the US Government to say that 'this isgood enough'." Clint Brooks, of NSA, then went over the revised criteria. He claimed thatthey were surprized at the industry concern over "one product" forworldwide markets. There were lots of questions. He eventually admittedthat because of the "one product" concern, export regulations will effectdomestic products. [all the more reason for Netscape to keep building tenor whatever it is.] Brooks admitted that it is impossible to prevent multiple encryption.Cypherpunks would do that by using PGP and then sending it using GAK.He said "as a person, you can set up a secure communication method, andnothing can be done about it." His concern is not that smart people canhave stronger crypto, but that strong crypto will be easy and widely used. He said that the 64-bit key limit is not meant to restrict RSA keys to64-bits, but rather to restrict the session keys that are encrypted usingRSA. Unspoken was the assumption that the 2000 bit RSA secret key wouldhave to be escrowed. There were some interesting (and bad IMHO) implications of interoperability.I'll cover them more in the long version. Basically, they admitted thatthe interoperability restrictions made it stupid to have an exportversion, you should have a strong domestic version, and an internationalversion developed offshore for sale to the rest of the world. They admitted that there can be no controls over export of data, so onceinteroperating software is available both domestically and from offshoresources, there is no value in the export controlled, crippled version. My favorite policeman, Geoff Greiveldinger, then described thecharacteristics of an acceptable key escrow agent. There was a long listof criteria, all unseen before the meeting. The general reactionof the audience was that these were "yet another set of criteria thatmust be met." Geoff claimed that they were simply trying to addressthe questions raised at the earlier meeting about who is anacceptable escrow agent. One point that caused a lot of concernwas that at least one employee of the escrow agent has to have a SECRETclearence. Industry, with a few exceptions, soundly said that this is a dumb idea,that there is no market, that the criteria are too hard, etc. ExceptPadgett Petersen, representing Lockheed-Martin. He said that LM thoughtthat the criteria were just peachy. The usual civil liberties folksalso soundly trashed it. There was a representative from Netscape. He said that they, as a companythink this is a terrible idea. They oppose it now, and will be issuinga company policy soon. I didn't catch his name, and couldn't find himto get the obviously carefully prepared text. If someone from Netscape, areyou listening Jeff W? could get me the text, I'll add it to my writeup. ****************** What I think it means: I believe that the government deeply wants to restrict domestic use ofstrong encryption, but they have no legal justification for doing so.They can't expect that they will get it if they go to Congress. So theyare attempting an end-arround using the export criteria, which they_do control_. They hope that the pain of having multiple versions will beso high that no vendor will bother, and all we'll have is crippledsoftware. The usual civil liberties lobby folks (CDT, EPIC, etc.) want tohold their own, industry sponsored meetings to develop workable systems. I think that the real key is for everyone, worldwide to insist onboth strong crypto and interoperability. The Germans are alreadywriting fine software and making fast hardware. Microsoft and Netscapecan easily afford to do some of their development offshore. If the productssell and are deployed, it won't matter what the govies want.

The information in this paper is not intended to represent fail-safe, cookie cutter solutions to the criteria, but only to generate more detailed discussions. [Note: the numbered articles are the ten key escrow criteria proposed by the Government in Discussion Papers 1, 2 and 3. The *comments* are the solutions suggested by the Government in this Paper #4.] 1. The product shall use an unclassified encryption algorithm (e.g. DES, RC4) with a key length not to exceed 64 bits. It is important to understand that key in this context is related to the number of bits needed to decrypt a message which are not available over the communications channel. For some encryption algorithms the key is defined to be a number of bits which are kept secret and a number of bits which are transmitted in the clear (message key / initialization vector / salt). This criterion only specifies the number of secret bits. 2. The product shall be designed to prevent multiple encryption (e.g. triple-DES). One way to do this would be for the encryption program to store the ciphertextfile name and the first n (e.g. 16) bytes of cipher for the last k (e.g. 8) encryptions. When the encryption routine is called, the program checks to see if the input file name is in the ciphertextfile list or the first n bytes of the file match any of the k cipher text streams stored. Likewise, a plaintext header could be appended to each ciphertextfile which says the file is encrypted. The encryption program would look for this header before encryption; if found, the program would not proceed with the encryption. These are just examples of what could be done. Each vendor's constraints will be different. 3. The key required to decrypt each message or file shall be accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the product, and such keys will be escrowed during manufacture in accordance with #10. If such keys are not escrowed during manufacture, the product shall be inoperable until the key is escrowed in accordance with #10. One way of doing this is for each user to have a Public and Private Escrow Key. The public escrow key is bound in a certificate signed by the Escrow Agent(s). This certificate would contain a key ID, the escrow agents's ID and the Public Escrow key. A header of the encrypted message could contain this certificate along with the message key, encrypted using the Public Escrow key. If the product is not escrowed during manufacture, the software will check to see if it has a valid escrow key prior to encrypting messages. 4. The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include with each encrypted message or file, in a format accessible by authorized entities, the identity of the key escrow agent(s), and information sufficient for the escrow agent(s) to identify the key or key components required to decrypt that message. Following the example for criterion #3, the certificate that contained the user's escrow key would also contain the identity of the escrow agents holding the corresponding pffvate escrow key. 5. The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be disabled by a static patch (i.e. the replacement of a block of code by a modified block). Probably the most important aspect of this criterion is that source code for a product should not be available. Also it is important that the cryptography be integrated into the application in some nontrivial way. One way of achieving this criterion is for the application to store a hash or checksum of the cryptographic code in several places and check the cryptographic code several times during its use. One can prevent a static patch by making the hash or checksums dependent on a program ID code or something else that is unique about that copy of the software. Perhaps one of the best ways to defeat hackers from "patching around" the escrow would be a commitment from vendors to make each new release of the software be immune to existing static patches and patch programs. 6. The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted by non-escrowed products, including products whose key escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled. If one follows the steps outlined under criterion #3, a receiving program could verify the escrow certificate contained in the message header, extract the escrow public key, and verify that the encrypted message decryption key is also found in the header. If it is not there, decryption does not proceed. 7. The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's encrypted information regardless of whether that user is the sender or the intended recipient of the encrypted information. The message header could contain the decryption key encrypted under both the sender's public escrow key and the recipient's public escrow key. Then access to either the sender's or recipient's private escrow key would allow access to the decryption key. 8. The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of multiple decryption keys during the period of authorized access. If the public and private escrow keys are unique to users, then the escrow agents could turn over the private escrow keys to the authorized parties. The private escrow key would allow access to keys encrypted with the corresponding public escrow key and not require repeated involvement with the escrow agents. 9. In the event any such product is or may be available in the United States, each production copy of the software shall either have a unique key required for decrypting messages or files that is escrowed in accordance with #10, or have the capability for its escrow mechanism to be re-keyed and any new key to be escrowed in accordance with #l0. Following the example in criterion #3, the software could accept the load of a new escrow certificate. The software could store a "root" public key which is used to verify a certificate containing the escrow agent public key which in turn is used to sign the individual user's escrow certificate. Hence the header might contain both the escrow agent certificate signed by the root and the user certificate signed by the escrow agent(s). Once escrowed, the software could store the ID of the escrow agents and not accept loads of new escrow keys except from those agents. 10. The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only with escrow agent(s) certified by the U.S. Government or by foreign governments with which the U.S. Government has formal agreements consistent with US law enforcement and national security requirements. Following the example in criterion #9, if the "root" authority only signed the certificates of escrow agents (foreign and domestic) approved by the U.S. Government then only keys escrowed by approved escrow agents will be accepted as valid by the software packages.

While the arrangement assures the government it can access dataunder extreme circumstances, it represents an advance in thestrength of security allowed in software exported from the UnitedStates. Federal law prohibits the export of certain high-levelencryption programs, which are defined as a munition under a ColdWar-era arms control act. Encryption programs take ordinary data and put it in secret formthat cannot be accessed without the proper data ``key.'' Thegovernment's arbitrary standard for cracking encryption programswhen needed is at a technical level described as ``40-bit.'' Some software programs sold in the United States, includingLotus Notes, now use stronger 64-bit encryption. Lotus has beenunder pressure to bring such security to Notes users overseas. Although 40-bit encryption is quite strong, highly-sophisticatedattacks using several computers have been able to break itrecently. ``Our customers have basically lost confidence in 40-bitcryptography,'' said Ray Ozzie, president of Iris Associates, theunit of Lotus that developed Notes. ``That left us in a bind. We are the vendor that's supposedlyselling a secure system to them and they are saying it's no good,''Ozzie told a standing room audience at the RSA Data Securityconference. Changes in the general export laws seemed unlikely so Lotusnegotiated an interim solution. The export version of Lotus Notes 4.0, which went on sale lastweek, includes 64-bit encryption but the company has given the U.S.government a special code that unlocks the final 24 bits. For companies that use the international version of Notes, it'sas if Lotus put two strong locks on a door and gave a key for oneto the U.S. government. Thieves have to get break through twolocks, the government only one. ``This protects corporate information from malicious crackersbut permits the government to retain their current access,'' Ozziesaid. He acknowledged the solution was only a compromise and saidLotus wants to see better data security methods developedworldwide. However, many participants at the conference saw the move as acosmetic answer to the tension between corporate desires for thebest security and government's interest to access data whennecessary. ``It's a useful stopgap measure that has no value in the longrun,'' said Donn Parker, a senior security consultant with SRIInternational, a computer research company in Menlo Park, Calif. Simson Garfinkel, author and computer security expert, said he'snot sure international buyers of Notes will like the solution. ``Foreign companies don't want the U.S. government to spy ontheir data any more than the U.S. government wants foreigncompanies to be able to spy on theirs,'' Garfinkel said. International Business Machines Corp. bought Lotus in July,citing the success of Notes, a sophisticated communications anddatabase program.

The report, which wasjointly produced by the Commerce Department's Bureau of ExportAdministration and the National Security Agency reviews the foreignavailability of encryption products and other nations' import, export anddomestic use policies. The report finds that there are foreign products available which "can havean impact on US competativeness" and that US export controls "may havediscouraged US software producers from enhancing the softare features ofgeneral purpose software to meet the anticipated growth demand by foreignmarkets. It anticipated that there is a steadily increasing demand forcrypto to be included in general use software products becuase of wellpublicized break-ins. A large portion of the report has been redacted by the NSA. EPIC filedsuit under the Freedom of Information Act in December 1995 to obtain afull copy of the report and will continue to demand its release. EPICbelieves that the US goverment should remove export controls on publicdomain and commerical software that contains encryption and end the policyof demanding that key escrow be implimented in all encryption software. Enclosed in the Commerce Department Press Release and Executive Summaryof the report. The full report is over 100 pages. EPIC will make everyeffort to make the full report available in electronic form as soon aspossible.

Moreover,the quality of products offeredabroad varies greatly, with some not providing the level of protectionadvertised. The study, jointly prepared by the Commerce Department's Bureau of ExportAdministration (BXA) and the National Security Agency (NSA), evaluates thecurrent and future market for computer software with encryption, whichallows users to protect their data using codes. The study also reviews theavailability of foreign encryption software and assesses the impact thatU. S. export controls on encryption have on the competitiveness of thesoftware industry. "Our study provides a clear snapshot of the international competition inthis segment that the software industry faces," said Cornmerce SecretaryRon Brown. "Better understanding of the products and the marketplace givesus the tools to ensure that our export control policies are appropriate,"he added. The study noted encryption software presently accounts for only a smallpercentage of the total computer software but should grow substantially asthe U.S. and other countries deveiop and expand public networks andelectronic commerce. The study found that the U.S. software industry still dominates worldmarkets. In those markets not offering strong encryption locally, U.S.software encryption remains the dominant choice. However, the existence offoreign products with labels indicating DES (Data Encryption Standard) orother strong algorithms, even if they are less secure than claimed, cannonetheless have a negative effect on U. S competitiveness. The study alsonotes that the existence of strong U.S. export controls on encryption mayhave discouraged U.S software producers from enhancing the securityfeatures of general purpose software products to meet the anticipatedgrowth in demand by foreign markets. page 2 All countries that are major producers of commercial encryption productswere found to control exports of the products to some extent. A fewcountries (e.g., France, Russia, and Israel) control imports and domesticuse of encryption, as well. As part of the study, NSA evaluated twenty-eight different foreignencryption software products, finding that some were less secure thanadvertised. Because customers lack a way to determine actual encryptionstrength, they sometimes choose foreign products over apparently weakerU.S. ones, giving those foreign products a competitive advantage. -30- A STUDY OF THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET FOR COMPUTER SOFTWARE WITH ENCRYPTION [Note: This is a redacted copy of the ogigional secret decoment. Brackets[] accompanied by the origional classifications have been used to indicatelocation and size of excised classified text] Prepared by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Security Agency for the Interagency Working Group on Encryption and Telecommunications Policy EXECUTIVE SUMMARY BACKGROVND In late 1994, the President's National Security Advisor directed that aninteragency report be prepared assessing the current and futureinternational market for software products containing encryption and theimpact of export controls on the U.S. software industry. The report was toinclude an assessment ofthe impact of U.S. encryption export controls onthe international competitiveness of the U.S. computer software industryand a review of the types, quality, and market penetration offoreign-produced encryption software products. This paper presents thejoint efforts of the Department of Commerce/Bureau of ExportAdministration and the National Security Agency to complete this tasking.(U) EXPORT CONTROLS All countries that are major producers of commercial encryption productscontrol exports of those products to some extent. Control methodologiesand licensing practices vary, however, and a few countries, most notably=46rance, Russia and Israel also control imports and/or domestic use ofencryption. There is a significant amount of international cooperation incontrolling encryption exports. (U) Some European and other countries apparently treat exports to the UnitedStates of DES- based software more liberally than the United States treatsDES exports to those countries. Some countries have stated that theygenerally restrict DES exports to financial end-uses. In general, noindependent verification of these licensing practices was obtained.However, in some cases the U.S. was able to obtain DES products from themfor non-financial end-uses. It is possible that some countries may allowthese exports based on their political/economic/military relationship withthe destination country (e.g., within the European Comrnunity, or formerCOCOM), for end uses that are considered legitimate commercialapplications of the technology, or, in the case of exports to the UnitedStates, because DES is a national standard. (U) As the technology and the marketplace have evolved, the USG export controlauthorities have relaxed licensing constraints on cryptographic productsseveral times over the past 10 years. These changes have usually been madeafter industry pressures and internal debate to balance national securityand economic concerns. (U) DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARXETS While presently encryption software accounts for only a small percentageof the total software market (1-3%), according to numerous informationsecurity experts contacted in the course of the study, the future growthtrend for this sector is expected to be great. The market for encryption in distributed computation, databases, andelectronic mail is beginning to expand exponentially as the U.S. and othercountries develop and popularize electronic commerce, public networks, anddistributed processing. (U) Encryption in these environments will often be implemented in software, asopposed to hardware, because it is generally less expensive and simpler toinstall and upgrade. Absent changes in government standards, for the nextten years, encryption software will primarily use DES and RSA-licensedencryption algorithms. Other non-standard and company proprietaryalgorithrns will be used primarily for security-specific products forsmall niche markets. (U) Certain developments are promoting greater use by the general public ofsoftware-based network security features, including encryption, throughoutthe industrialized world. They include ever increasing use, fueled by wellpublicized "break-ins," of distributed databases, popular acceptance andusage of global networks, and the development and use of electroniccommerce. (U) These developments are ongoing at one stage or another in practically allof the countries surveyed for this assessment. Less technologicallyadvanced countries, where demand for encryption software is reportedlynegligible, will soon undergo widespread development and computerizationleading to increased demand for encryption so~ware within the next 10years. (U) The overwhelming majority (75%) of general-purpose software products(e.g., word processors, spread sheet programs, and database programs)available on foreign markets today are of U.S. origin. CornmerceDepartment analyses indicate that the U.S. has few viable foreigncompetitors for such products, and of those general-purpose products withencryption features, all were found to be of U.S. origin. (U) In the security specific software market, however, U. S. manufacturersface competition in several foreign markets from such encryption exportingcountries as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Israel. To a large extent,markets for these products tend to be "national. " Not only do exportcontrols affect sales, but local vendors of security-specific products areat a competitive advantage in that they are better situated to workclosely with end- users and develop encryption solutions tailored to meetthe conditions of the local environment. (U) NSA confirmed the existence of a significant number of foreignsecurity-specific software products with encryption features,predominantly from Western European suppliers. Security-specific productsare usually not available on the shelf at retail stores either in the U.S.or abroad, but can be purchased through direct contact with themanufacturer. (U) ES-2 BXA attempted to quantify U.S. competitiveness and market share in 31foreign countries where encryption is thought to have significant demand.While sources in the countries surveyed had limited access to importstatistics or market literature on encryption software and encounterednwnerous difficulties in evaluating this complex market, definiteconclusions may be drawn from the responses. (U) Sources in 14 countries indicated that U.S. export controls limit U.S.market share in their countries. Sources in seven countries indicated thatexport controls have either no impact or no major impact. (U) Sources in most countries indicated that the U.S. market share is keepingpace with overall demand despite the impact of U.S. export controls, whichmay promote indigenous production or reduce U. S. market penetration. Inall known cases, the U.S. holds the majority of the general-purposeencryption software market. (U) Three exceptions are Switzerland (where the U.S. market share reportedlydeclined in 1994, while the market shares of other European countriesrose), Denmark and the United Kingdom, which reported unspecified declinesfrom previous years. Sources in all three countries attribute the declineto U.S. export controls, which they claim promote the development and saleof indigenous encryption products. (U) In many countries surveyed, exportable U. S. encryption products areperceived to be of unsatisfactory quality. (U) ANALYSIS OF FOREIGN PRODUCTS NSA used various methods to procure encryption software products from avariety of countries and companies, as reflected in the TIS database andother sources. Altogether, 28 products from 22 foreign producers in 10countries were acquired for the purposes of this study. Of these, 21purportedly use the DES algorithm, while the remaining 7 use proprietaryalgorithms. (U) [ ] (S) ES-3 ECONOMIC IMPACT In the absence of significant foreign competition, the impact of U.S.export controls on the international market shares of general-purposeproducts is probably negligible. Customers are often unaware of theencryption features in these products and primarily base purchases on thefeatures implementing the primary function of the product (e.g., wordprocessing or database). (U) [ ] (S) BXA attempted to quantify the economic impact of export controls on theU.S. software industry by forwarding a detailed voluntary questionnaire to206 software vendors and other interested parties. Thirty six encryptionsoftware manufacturers provided completed surveys out of the 71 returned.By and large, the companies were unable or unwilling to quantify the costsof export controls, but did provide substantive explanations of how andwhy they believe they are adversely affected. (U) Some general-purpose software companies claim that export controls haveaffected their plans to expand security features to meet anticipatedgrowing demand. These companies believe that they could expand theirdomestic and international customer base with such features. (U) The export licensing process itself is not a major obstacle to U. S.competitiveness. Only seven survey respondents use the Department of Statelicensing system. While they continue to have some complaints about theadministrative burdens and time delays associated with State's process,several noted that there had been improvements in recent years. Only twoof the survey respondents had been denied licenses by the Department ofState. (U) Numerous survey respondents indicated that they avoided applying forexport licenses from the Department of State altogether. Some largercompanies whose products tended to be general-purpose in nature eitherdeveloped two ~fersions of so~ware, or incorporated an encryptionalgorithm they knew would qualify for Commerce general licenses. (U) Many smaller, security-specific software firms, on the other hand, electedto limit their sales to the domestic market only. These companiesindicated a high level of foreign interest in purchasing their products,and therefore lost potential sales. While it is difficult for them toquantify their potential market, they believe it to be sizeable. Theyclaim their small size limited their ability to develop two versions oftheir products, and the fact that their products were for secunty purposes ES-4 specifically requires them to incorporate strong encryption. Only onecompany was able to provide specific examples where a foreign competitoro~ta ned a sale due to an export license denied by U.S. authorities. (U) There is little evidence that U.S. export controls have had a negativeeffect on the availability of products in the U.S. marketplace. A broadrange of products with secure algorithms exist in the U. S. market andavailability of products is based principally on the level of customerdemand. Export controls may have hindered incorporation of strongencryption algorithms in some domestic mass-market, general-purposeproducts, since some companies find developing and maintaining twoversions of a product infeasible. (U) The existence of foreign products with labels indicating DES or otherstrong encryption algorithms, even if they are less secure than claimed,can nonetheless have a negative effect on U.S. competitiveness. Mostencryption users base their purchasing decisions on the advertised productfeatures, along with price, company reputation, etc. (U) Back to Pat's page on the December 5 NIST Clipper 2 meeting.

Sosei has invented an efficient system to identify and obtain important biopharmaceutical technology arising in top-tier Japanese universities. 2. Sosei has already identified and obtained key technology in a variety of medically important areas (e.g. liver disease). 3. Sosei has already established a track record of strategic alliances both for itself (e.g. Sumitomo-unannounced significant deal) and for third parties (e.g. Geron - $30M) 4. Sosei's management, business advisors and shareholders represent top quality experience in global licensing and investment activities. 5. Sosei has outstanding scientific advisors especially in hepatology and gerontology related research. 6. Sosei's international set-up has given it unique acess to U.S.,Europe and Japan for funding, markets, technology and patenting andregulatory flexibility. 7. Relationships are accelerating Sosei's rapid progress: Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has made a serious commitment for HGF development, ensuring significant license fees and royalties paid to Sosei. Sosei has helped Koseisho (Japanese FDA/NIH) set up consortium (Agene) providing research funds for the aging project as well as strong ties to the member companies ($30M fund). Tokyo University and Osaka University give access to innovative technologies in Japan. 8. Global venture capital funding already established: $0.9M investment from S.R. One in Sept. '92. $4M investment commitment from Schroder, S.R. One, Oxford Bioscience and Biotechnology Investments Limited (Advised by Rothschilds) in January, 1994. $4M raised for the License Fund in mid 1995.

To facilitate development of these relationships, several organizations and consulting groups have organized partnering conferences to bring biotechnology closer to interested Japanese companies in the hope that discussions will lead to partnering agreement supporting research and product development by the biotech partner. US and European biotech companies are realistic in their aspirations, and see business cooperation with Japanese companies as a potential source of funding in return for technology rights for Japanese and SEA markets where their technology would otherwise go undeveloped. Japanese companies, on the other hand, are finding themselves having to respond to changes in the Japanese pharmaceutical environment caused in part by government's response to rising healthcare costs: * Forced to take more risk by the changing regulatory environment- i.e., pricing guidelines that reward innovation. * Must compete among themselves and with foreign-affiliated companies for technology that allows breakthrough innovation. * Western companies are more and more proactive in obtaining Japan/SEA rights in their biotechnology deals and are willing to provide the same financial terms as Japanese companies as part of a worldwide agreement. * Foreign-affiliated companies are more willing than Japanese companies to assume high risk projects while providing for the long-term strategic interests of their biotech partner. The vast number of biotechnology companies visiting Japan to present their technology, however, has overwhelmed the capacity for most Japanese companies to understand, both scientifically and commercially, the implications of the technology presented and make informed investment decisions. The consequence many times is a polite hearing and lunch, with the biotechnology message lost or not entirely appreciated. Biotechnology companies leave feeling good, when in reality they are the victims of Japanese politeness. This scenario can be avoided on both sides by more focused presentations to companies pre selected based on research and commercial interests, given an opportunity to review and comment informally on introductory information provided by the biotechnology company. BioGlobe provides a communication tool to allow both Japanese and emerging biotechnology companies a competitive advantage to make productive use of time and money in progressing partnering initiatives and relationship building in Japan. BioGlobe provides an interface between Western and Japanese business cultures, allowing each side to better appreciate the nuances of 'deal making' in Japan. Differences in definition of risk, an appreciation of the regulatory and commercial healthcare environment, which, for many technologies is problematical, and problems inherent in communicating in a second language for Japanese can be attenuated, allowing quality communication between both scientists and commercial people on both sides of the discussion. BioGlobe and Sosei, on behalf of subscribing companies , can facilitate opportunities, technical assessments and deal making, increasing understanding and the probability that an agreement will emerge. Koseisho (Ministry of Health and Welfare) understand that cutting-edge healthcare technology is required for the Japanese pharmaceutical industry to remain worldwide players and for government to reduce healthcare costs. Koseisho is lending support to BioGlobe to encourage interaction with both themselves, providing dialogue as they consider new regulatory policies, and industry to progress government's responsibility to society in providing the best healthcare possible. Sosei is both a biotechnology company with its own research programs, and an asset-development company focused on value-added bi-directional biopharmaceutical technology transfer between Japan/SEA and the West. Sosei is funded by several US and European venture capital groups, and has successfully concluded partnering relationships in Japan for both its own technologies and several US biotechnology companies. Kyoto Research Park (KRP), 100% subsidiary of Osaka Gas company, where 80 companies and R&D institutions are located in the center city of Kyoto, operates a research park. KRP consists of 8 buildings and has three primary objectives: Promotion of technological innovation and the development of new core technologies. To foster the development of high technology venture businesses. To facilitate entry by foreign firms into the Japanese market. Among KRP's support services, KRP organizes the Life Science Technology Transfer Forum (LSTTF), which encourages information exchange between industry and academia in life science-related fields. It also provides foreign firms with opportunities to meet the LSTTF members through presentation, exhibition and business matching meeting, etc. at the LSTT forum. Generics Group is a uniquely innovative global organisation combining excellence in the strategic application of technology in business. Founded in 1986 it is already Europe's leading laboratory based business and technology consulting and investment company.Generics is the preferred partner of many major international corporations in the US, Japan and Europe. Generics also invests in its own scientific research programmes in many areas in addition to the Life Sciences, for example, in new materials, optics and magnetics. These are then commercialised through royalties or through incorporation in a new business venture. The Group has therefore extensive experience in creative technology transfer between and within corporations in most industry sectors. Sosei and Generics intend to collaborate further in pursuit of their common goals to establish the most effective and efficient R&D system from a global perspective.

This strategyis oftentimes preferred to giving up the worldwide right to a multi-nationalcompany, for the biotech company can keep at least the North American andEuropean rights intact rendering it more flexibility for future businessdevelopment. Such being the case, the biotech company needs a quick cashinjection and a reasonable R&D support from a Japanese partner to maintainits business. The biotech company will first approach the top-tier full fledged companies.It would be the ideal partner if a deal can be finalized in a reasonabletime scale, which is an exception rather than a rule. The biotech companycannot afford such a time consuming lengthy negotiations. The second target is a company belonging to the medium-tier group. The biotechcompanies will have a difficulty to find a right window for these relativelyunknown companies. These companies sometimes lack adequate capacity fordue diligence and sophisticated product development capabilities. Despitea possibility of a quick deal with a company in this group, the biotechcompany may have to face with claims for misrepresentation or non-performancelater on. The third choice is a new comer to the pharmaceutical industry. Some ofthese companies have extremely flexible strategy and can move relativelyquickly. They are oftentimes cash rich and eager to license innovative technologiesto consolidate their pharmaceutical business platform. Sometimes they alsolack due diligence capabilities and are yet to establish the developmentand marketing forces. Hence their strong motivation to secure their owndevelopment or marketing partners. In many cases, these parners are thetop-tier companies in Japan. In consideration of the above situation, Sosei has recently launched a new fund (SoseiLicense Fund #1) with some of these cash rich new comers. Sosei will helpthem (the partners) with the due diligence and provide a sizable optionfee for Asian rights to a biotech company in a much shorter time scale thanit would take to negotiate with a traditional Japanese company. Sosei willalso support the research, whenever appropriate, to add value to the technologyin concern to meet with requirements from Japanese companies. The partnershave 3 months' exclusive evaluation period and Sosei is free to negotiatewith any other party when this period expires. The license fee will be eventuallypaid in by the partners or third parties to be identified. The biotech companycan keep a majority portion of the license fee, depending on its relativecontribution. Sosei is extremely well connected to the decision makers of the Japanesepharmaceutical companies and is updated with precise needs of most of thecompanies. Therefore, Sosei can afford a needs-oriented business leadingto a very high success rate of the partnering. This is evidenced by theSosei's track record as an efficient deal maker. TRACK RECORD (May, 1995) Only major deals, for which Sosei played a pivotal role, with size closeto or in excess of two billion yen are listed.

These antibodies were produced from GenPharm's HuMAb-Mouse(TM), a transgenic mouse line containing human antibody genes that rearrange to form high affinity human antibodies. The mice can be used to generate monoclonal human antibodies to a wide variety of antigens, including human antigens. GenPharm's initial transgenic mouse was described in the British journal `Nature` (Nature 368:856). The work presented today covers the addition of other human sequences into the mouse along with extensive characterization of fully human IgG antibodies generated by it. These monoclonal antibodies had affinity levels suitable for therapeutic use with the highest affinity at greater than 10 to the 10th. Separately, GenPharm announced today that it had signed a renewal of its R&D Collaboration Agreement with Eisai Co. Ltd., a leading Japanese human health care company headquartered in Tokyo. The original agreement with Eisai, worth up to $25 million for research and milestone payments, was established in 1993. `We are delighted with Eisai's confidence in the value of GenPharm's novel technology and look forward soon to bringing important medical products to the clinic for the benefit of human patients,` commented Jonathan MacQuitty, Ph.D., chief executive officer of GenPharm International. GenPharm International Inc. is a world leader in the development of human monoclonal antibodies from transgenic mice for therapeutic and diagnostic uses. Background GenPharm's transgenic HuMAb-Mouse contains key sequences from unrearranged human antibody genes as well as having inactivated mouse antibody genes. The human sequences code for both the human heavy and light chain segments of human antibodies. The human gene sequences function well in the mouse undergoing rearrangement to provide a wide repertoire of human antibodies similar to that in humans. Most importantly, the human antibodies in the transgenic mice undergo class switching and somatic mutation from low affinity IgM class antibodies to high affinity human IgG class antibodies. GenPharm has now generated human IgG antibodies using its transgenic mouse system with affinities that exceed 10 to the 10th. Antibodies for therapeutic use need affinities in this range to have clinical utility. In addition, because these antibodies are generated from human sequences, they should avoid the rejection problems that have often affected mouse-based antibodies. Another important feature of GenPharm's HuMAb-Mouse is its ability to react against human antigens. Thus, unlike most antibodies produced in humans, GenPharm's mice can generate human antibodies with high affinity against human antigens. This allows for the possibility of using human antibodies to control a wide range of inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases and cancers. GenPharm has already generated human IgG antibodies to various human antigens, including IgE, CD4 and the cancer antigen CEA. Because the human sequences in the HuMAb-Mouse can generate high affinity human IgG directly in the mice, it is unnecessary to subject the human antibodies produced to any further manipulation, either to `humanize` the antibodies or to improve their affinity or specificity. Because the antibodies have been matured `in vivo,` they naturally have the specificity and affinity necessary for proper binding to the target antigen.

Tetlow Vice President and Chief Financial Officer tetlow@mx.trpntech.com Employees: approximately 62 (21 Ph.D.s) Facilities: 20,000 square feet Company Overview: Terrapin is a privately held pharmaceutical discovery company which has achieved considerable success in establishing: A proprietary, enabling technology for rapidly identifying novel,small-molecule therapeutic compounds. Product leads offering significant competitive advantages––including TER199 and TER286 for use in the fields of oncology/hematology, and a family of small molecules for the treatment of diabetes. An innovative exploratory program focused on novel disease targets and novel product candidates for major T-cell-mediated immunological diseases and disorders. Terrapin’s mission is to build a portfolio of novel pharmaceuticals that address important medical needs in sizable markets. Utilizing its patented molecular fingerprinting technology, the Company has already identified severalsmall-molecule product leads which have proven biological activity against key disease mechanisms. The most significant of these are TER199, which addresses the $1 billion colony stimulating factor market in oncology/hematology, and the diabetes compounds which could lead to a major advance in the $3 billion diabetes market. In addition, the Company’sexploratory program in T-cell regulation is leading to broad therapeutic opportunities in the multi-billion dollar autoimmune disease, transplantation and asthma markets. To commercialize its drug discoveries, Terrapin intends to establish corporate partnerships and, where appropriate, to retain U.S. rights to molecules it wants to develop for its own portfolio. Discussions are currently in progress with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, with the goal of entering into collaborative and/or licensing arrangements on initial product leads. This strategy will allow the Company to pursue a number of drug discovery projects simultaneously, maximizing the value of its technology while alsotaking advantage of the clinical trial, marketing and distributioninfrastructure of its partners. Program Overview: Oncology/Hematology TER199 –– This novel, orally active molecule has been shown in preclinical (in vivo) studies to accelerate the reappearance of circulatingneutrophils, platelets, erythrocytes and lymphocytes following their suppression by chemotherapeutic agents. TER199 thus has the potential of being used in placeof colony stimulating factors in all clinical applications––such as the rescue of myelosuppression following chemotherapy, the treatment ofneutropenia, and the transplantation of bone marrow––while also having the advantage of oral bioavailability. In addition, TER199 offers the opportunity to provide the potential benefits of MGDF and TPO for platelet growth and the treatment of thrombocytopenia. Terrapin expects to file its Investigational New Drug application in 1996 to initiate human clinical studies in cancer patients. TER286 –– A tumor-activated compound, TER286 only becomes toxic when encountering elevated levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozymes. GSTs have been shown to be responsible for drug resistance, and levels of certain GSTs are elevated in difficult-to-treat cancers such as lung, ovarian and breast cancer. TER286 has exhibited excellent efficacy in animal tumor model systems and in primary human tumor cells in culture, often outperforming currently used products such as taxol, cisplatin and fluorouracil. In animals, TER286 also exhibits significantly reduced bone marrow toxicity compared to currently available therapies. To develop TER286, Terrapin intends to establish a strategic alliance with a corporate partner that can bring the product to market as part of a portfolio of cancer-fighting agents. Diabetes Terrapin scientists have discovered a family of small molecules which directly activate the human insulin receptor. These molecules offer the potential to regulate both insulin and blood glucose levels with oral therapy. The Company’s most promising diabetes lead has been shown to interact directly with the insulin receptor and to potentiate insulin’s action in intact cell studies. Further validating this treatment approach, Terrapin has demonstrated a lowering of blood glucose and circulating insulin levels in preclinical (in vivo) models of type II (adult onset) diabetes. Terrapin plans to apply its medicinal chemistry expertise, alone or with a strategic partner, to identify a novel compound based on its leads for entry into human clinical studies. Immunology The discovery and development of safe and effective agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune conditions represents a broad scientific and commercial opportunity for Terrapin. Company research has led to newly discovered intracellular proteins that provide the mechanistic basis for regulating T-cell activities. These intracellular proteins offer the promise of much-needed molecular specificity for controlling inflammation –– without the toxicity common with other immunosuppressives. The Company’s work centers on both novel molecular targets and novel product candidates, initially for the treatment of autoimmune disease, transplant rejection and asthma. Proprietary Drug Discovery Technology The Company’s innovative molecular fingerprinting technology, known as TRAP™, has been the driving force for the success of Terrapin’s projects. This powerful technology is designed to accelerate drug discovery and early product development activities that currently represent major productivity bottlenecks for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Moreover, it allowsthe discovery of drug candidates from large chemical libraries at anunprecedented level of efficiency. TRAP classifies small molecules by distinct computer-readable patterns, or “molecular fingerprints,” based on specific protein-binding characteristics. By computationally screening its large database of highly diverse chemicals, Terrapin can rapidly identify compounds that are likely to interact with a given disease target. Unlike other computer screening techniques, TRAP is distinctive in being able to search among compounds with vastly different chemicalstructures, based on properties directly relevant to potential pharmaceutical utility. Furthermore, TRAP can predict functional relationships without prior knowledge of the structure of either the molecule or the disease target. As a result, scientists can identify medically relevant lead compounds without depleting precious supplies of rare materials and can intelligently apply sophisticated modern chemistry, such as combinatorial chemistry and computer modeling of molecules, to develop novel product candidates. Protecting its technology, Terrapin has established a strong proprietary position with patents and trade secrets. Fourteen patents have been issued or allowed, protecting the core technology, composition of matter and use. Numerous additional patent applications are pending. Investors: Since its inception, Terrapin has raised over $35 million in funding from both venture capital and private investors. Venture investors include Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co.; Weiss, Peck & Greer; Oxford Bioscience Partners; Advent International; Delphi Bioventures; Hambrecht & Quist Capital Management; Alpha Partners; MDS Health Ventures Capital Corp., GIMV and Sofinnova. Private investors include the Swanson Family Fund Ltd. and Dr. Alejandro Zaffaroni. Founded: 1986 First Round Venture Funding: 1991 Business Strategy and Corporate Partnering Opportunities: One of the key strengths of Terrapin’s technology is that it can be applied to a wide range of small-molecule drug discovery and development projects. At the same time, it has broad applicability beyond therapeutics to a variety of other commercial arenas. Terrapin has chosen to concentrate on innovative human therapeutics that address significant market needs and to recognize value in other areas, where appropriate, through out-license or spin-off. In addition to building its own therapeutic portfolio, Terrapin expects to collaborate with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies which are exploring their own disease-related targets. Terrapin believes that the ability of its technology to rapidly qualify targets of opportunity, discover therapeutic leads and optimize product candidates increases the probability of finding a compoundof significant therapeutic and commercial value. Currently, through an agreement with Japan Tobacco Inc., Terrapin is using its TRAP technology to create a fingerprint database for a highly diverse chemical library of 20,000 compounds. In addition, through agreements with a number of biotechnology companies, Terrapin is using its TRAP technology to detect compounds in its own diverse library that are active against targets of interest to its collaborators.

Renton President and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Frank McCormick Chief Scientific Officer Dr. William Gerber Chief Operating Officer Employees:85 employees, including 35 Ph.D./M.D.s Facility:ONYX Pharmaceuticals is a 40,000 square foot facility located in Richmond, CA Founders: ONYX was founded in 1992 as a spin-off from Chiron Corporation, based on the leading research of Frank McCormick, Ph.D. and his laboratory in the areas of Ras oncogenes, and of founding scientific advisors in tumor suppressor genes, and signal transduction. Date Established:April 24, 1992 Investments: ($000) Series A Series B Series C Series D Future Committed 400 5,000 12,200 17,100 7,333 Principal Investors: A group of leading venture capital investors including, Avalon Ventures, Institutional Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Sprout Group, Sierra Ventures, Robertson, Stephens & Co., Sequoia Capital, New York Life, Mutual of New York, Alex Brown, Forward Ventures. In addition to Chiron, Bayer, and Parke-Davis. Financial History: ONYX is privately held and to date has raised $42 million in equity. Corporate Overview: The mission of ONYX is to develop novel therapeutics to treat serious diseases. Our central research activity is to combine the latest molecular biology techniques with the expanding knowledge of intracellular signaling pathways to develop new strategies for therapeutic discovery. Our business model is to stay focused on research and drug discovery, while seeking corporate partners for clinical development and commercialization. Agreements: Company Field Date Bayer Ras May 1994 Parke-Davis Cell Cycle Regulation May 1995 Eli Lilly Breast Cancer May 1995 Technology Overview: ONYX has established three initial drug discovery programs with a near-term focus on molecular oncology: Ras Signaling: ONYX's first drug discovery program, now the subject of the ONYX/Bayer collaboration, focuses on the Ras signaling pathway. Ras is a protein which is activated by a family of growth factors and plays a key role in controlling cell growth and differentiation.Small molecule drugs that turn off Ras activity or reduce it to normal levels may offer effective new therapies for many cancers, as well as other hyperproliferative diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Cell Cycle Regulators: ONYX research also focuses on proteins involved in regulating the cell cycle. ONYX and its corporate partner, the Parke-Davis division of Warner-Lambert, hope to develop new therapeutics for cancer and other diseases. Potential products may act by restoring the normal function of mutated cell cycle proteins or by otherwise restoring the normal growth/death cycle to abnormal cells. Adenovirus Therapy for p53 Mutated Tumors: A key discovery was made at ONYX that adenovirus can be modified to selectively replicate in and kill tumor cells deficient in p53, but not normal cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments have validated the concept, and the product is scheduled to enter the clinic early in 1996. This discovery is being extended to other viruses and diseases. Current Corporate Partners: Bayer Parke-Davis Eli Lilly Corporate Partnering Opportunities: ONYX will continue to apply its strategy to create corporate alliances for each of its product programs. The company expects to complete an alliance in the area of adenovirus therapy for p53-mutated tumors in 1996. It is also seeking with Warner-Lambert a Japanese partner for the cell cycle collaboration. Management: Dr. Frank McCormick - frank@ONYX-pharm.com Dr. Frank McCormick is a recognized leader in the research of ras oncogenes and GAP proteins, two major molecular targets for ONYX. Prior to the formation of ONYX, Dr. Frank McCormick was vice president of therapeutics and biological research at Chiron Corporation. He began his career at Cetus Corporation as a staff scientist in 1981 and was director of molecular biology prior to becoming vice president, discovery research in 1990. Dr. McCormick completed post-doctoral research at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London. He received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from Cambridge University in England. He is the author of over 100 publications in leading journals. Hollings C. Renton - hollings@ONYX-pharm.com Prior to joining ONYX in 1993, Hollings Renton was the President and Chief Operating Officer of Chiron Corporation. He assumed that position in 1991 on Chiron's acquisition of Cetus Corporation, where he had been President since 1990 and Chief Operating Officer since 1987. He holds an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan. Dr. William Gerber - bgerber@ONYX-pharm.com Dr. Gerber comes to ONYX from Chiron Corporation, where he has been president of the Chiron Diagnostics business unit since Chiron's merger with Cetus Corporation in December 1991. He joined Cetus in 1987 as senior director of corporate ventures and was named vice president and general manager, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) division in November 1988. He earned a bachelor of science degree and a doctor of medicine degree from the School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.

Geron's ability to address a diversity of age-related disease states is based on insights into the fundamental biological mechanisms of cellular aging - and conversely, into the process by which cancer cells escape "aging" by becoming "immortal". Geron believes that many diseases of aging are due primarily to genetically programmed aging, or senescence, of cells in the various bodily tissues. Geron and its collaborators have pioneered the understanding of the genetic "clock" of cellular senescence. The clocking mechanism consists of Telomeres -- repeated DNA sequences found at the ends of chromosomes. telomeres shorten each time a cell divides until they reach a critically short length which is associated with the onset of cell senescence. At the opposite extreme, the age-related disease of cancer occurs because of the failure of cells to senesce owing to mutations that confer replicative immortality. Geron's research programs seek to intervene with the fundamental mechanisms underlying age-related disease through modulation of cell senescence. Further, Geron seeks to develop therapeutics to treat cancer by inhibiting the immortalizing enzyme telomerase. Geron Scientific Program Overview* Program Description Disease Target Telomerase Inhibition Induce cell death by inhibiting the enzyme telomerase, restoring tumor cell's normal biological "clock" Cancer therapeutics and diagnostics Senescent Gene Expression Identify and develop factors specific to young versus senescent cells to provide therapies to restore normal cell function selectively. Provide models to screen for and test modulators of senescent gene expression Therapeutics and diagnostics for age-related disorders such as atherosclerosis, immunosenescence, BPH, neurodegenerative diseases, osteoarthritis and skin ulcers. Telomer Length Modulation Increase normal cell replicative life span by extending telomere repeats at the end of chromosomes Therapeutics and diagnostics for age-related disorders *All programs are currently in the stage of Research Investors:Geron has raised over $30 million to-date from leading private investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, Venrock Associates, CW Group, Oxford Venture Partners, Domain Associates, and Biotechnology Investments, Ltd. Founded: 1992 Corporate partnering opportunities: Geron is currently searching for a pharmaceutical partner in the U.S. and Europe for telomerase inhibition for cancer, and worldwide, in senescent gene expression for age-related disease. Geron is also interested in developing a relationship with a diagnostics company for telomerase diagnostics in Europe and Japan. Scientific Advisory Board: Gunter K.

Professor K.Murakami of Kanazawa University, Cancer Center, in Japan, reported the relationship between X protein and some transcription factor, that was a first finding and very interesting. As you know, Hepatitis B Virus has gene X in its own genome and when this virus is infected to human or chimpanzee hepatocytes, protein X is usually expressed in the cells. However, the function of protein X has never been elucidated for a long time. He has challenged to produce protein X and MW800K protein derived from hepatocytes by E.coli expression system and confirmed them to be associated. Especially, protein X was found to bind specifically to RPB5 protein of some kinds of transcription factors. Furthermore, he expected this protein X and RPB5 protein complex might activate some genes related hepatocellular carcinoma. This news was derived from Nikkan Kogyo Shinbun(Jan.19,1995) and later I will confirm the content of this new result. Any way, the story of protein X and some transcription factor binding seems to be likely. If it is, we will be able to make a assay system for screening of binding inhibitors for cancer prevention. In Japan 24000 persons lost their lives due to hepatoma in 1994, and 20-30% of them was caused by Hepatitis B virus infection. Further studies have to be done.

Dr.S.Sakaguchi in JRDC has established the mouse which had some kind of autoimmune disease sympton without CD4 and CD25 T cells. First, he found, in case CD4 and CD25 T cells were present on low level in mice, autoimmune disease was observed in high frequency. Second, CD4 and CD25 deficient T cells were injected into some mice without T cells, so that insulin dependent diabetes, thyroiditis, ovaritis, gastritis with pernicious anemia and arthritis were appeared, which was very similar to human autoimmune disease sympton. The other way, to this type of mice, CD4 and CD25 T cells were added, as a result, above sympton was disappeared. To make sure, he challenged to make mice without genes of CD4 and CD25. As expected, autoimmune disease was observed. The symptons of autoimmune diseases were a little different among different genetics mice. From these results, it is likely that some T cells in normal mice attack normal cells, and CD4 and CD25 T cells are usually suppressing above T cells to do it. This idea may be applied to prevention and therapy for autoimmune disease and cancer.

"The decision of investment and financing items for fiscal 1994" March 8, 1995 The Organization for Drug ADR Relief, R&D Promotion and Product Review (reference) Investment and Financing Division, R&D Promotion Department Toshiaki Kondo 9F Shinkasumigaseki Bldg 3-2, 3-chome Kasumigaseki Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 100 TEL:03-3506-9541 1.The Organization for Drug ADR Relief, R&D Promotion and Product Review has decided one item for investment(the amount;30 million yen) and two items for financing(the amount;45 million yen). 2.These items are the results of selection from candidates applied from September 16 to 30, 1994, after careful consideration. This choice of the investment item made 12 corporations as total corporations invested by this organization which contained 11 corporations selected from fiscal 1987 to 1993. But in the cases of 2 corporations the investment should stop in March,1995 so that 10 corporations will continue from April, 1995. The choice of two financing items made 27 corporations which contained 25 selected from fiscal 1987 to 1993. 3. The outline of investment item is as follows. The theme name of research; Research on gene therapy products. The name of corporation; DNAVEC Research Inc. Participating companies; Hisamitu, kyowa, Sankyo, Shionogi, Yamanouchi, Sumitomo and Tanabe.The outline of research theme; Gene therapy is expected very much to apply to, cancers whose usual therapies have been ineffective, and chronic diseases or hereditary diseases whose medicinal treatment have not been satisfactory and whose treatment is necessary for all one's life. This research is focusing on establishment of gene transfer method as most suitable, and making a process practicable on gene therapy against various diseases. For above purpose, this research is to develop new vectors, control method of gene expression and vectors production technology on a large scale. 4. The outline of financing two items are as follows. The theme name of research; Development of drugs for IgA nephropathy. The outline of research; This research and development is focusing on development of monoclonal antibodies against IgA nephropathy for therapy. The theme name of research; Research on desage form and efficacy on herbal medicines. This research is focusing on analysing the relationship between preparation methods and efficacies or medicinal actions in herbal medicines. 5.Contents of research on gene therapy products. 1)Present state and necessity; Gene therapy has been desiged as a fundamental therapy to hereditary diseases and intractable diseases, and in 1990 a first trial in the world was applied to hereditary immunodeficiency disease(adenosine deaminase deficiency disease) as therapeutics.As a result, a dramatic efficacy was recognized so that clinical studies has been widely applied, for example, against cancers whose mortal rate is higher. In the world, more than 90 sorts of clinical studies on gene therapy were granted permission, and more than 200 cases in fact have been in force. Furthermore, hereafter, it's number is expected to increase. On the other hand, in Japan, "An expert committee on gene therapy" was established by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in October, 1991, and " Guideline of clinical study on gene therapy" was approved in April, 1993. Furthermore, "Central Assessment Committee for Gene Therapy" was established in February,1994 and possibility on application of gene therapy has been started to examine in Japanese medical institutions. In some medical institutions, applications on clinical studies using virus vectors developed by foreign venture companies were already submitted to an ethics committee in each institution. Thus, everyone expects much from gene therapy. However, a clinical study on gene therapy in Japan is following in the footsteps of the foreign countries because of using virus vectors introduced from foreign venture companies. These existing virus vectorsare unsatisfactory from the view points of cell specificity in gene transfer, the rate of gene transfer and the gene expression rate, so that it is very difficult to conduct gene therapy with a wide use. Therefore, this research is focusing on developing new types of vector constructions on original gene therapy and their production methods, which have high efficiency and safety in order to anchor forthcoming gene therapy in Japan with a highly wide use andhigh safety. 2)Technical development; This is to develop new types of vectors with higher therapeutic value than existing vectors by two types of basic approaches, "study on construction of new vectors on gene therapy" and "search on reinforcing efficacy on new gene therapy. 1]Study on construction of new vectors on gene therapy; This is to develop new types of vectors with gene transfer metods with target cells specificity, high transfer rate and high physical stability. 2]Search on reinforcing efficacy on new gene therapy; This is to develop control methods of gene expression on gene therapy for high rate of gene expression, organ specificity and irritability of gene expression(region, time control). It is also to conduct applied research of new therapeutic gene to reinforce remedial value. 3]Study on production of new vectors on gene therapy; This is to develop production technology for above vectors on gene therapy. It is also to establish technology for quality guaranteed on gene therapy. 3.Expected effectiveness; 1]It is expected to develop new vectors on gene therapy with higher efficiency than existing vectors. 2]It is expected to develop new and effective therapeutic method by new gene therapy with high efficacy, against incurable diseases, cancer or viral diseases. 3]Above results are expected to apply widely to autoimmune diseases such as chronic articular rheumatism, chronic diseases such as hyperpiesia, incurable diseases such as Alzheimer disease and senile dementia. 4.Outline of new corporation; The name of corporation;DNAVEC research Inc. Corporations investing;Hisamitsu, Kyowa, Sankyo, Shionogi, Sumitomo, Tanabe and Yamanouchi. The total amount of investment;48.2 million yen, the amount invested by this organization;30 million yen.

It provides me with the insight I need as a CEO." -- David Holveck, Chief Executive Officer, Centocor Inc. "BioCentury is far more than a collection of the week's press releases. It's insightful and thought-provoking. I just wish you didn't share it with my competitors." -- Skip Klein, Analyst, T. Rowe Price "In addition to being very strong scientifically, Karen Bernstein ties together events and deals into themes that explain where biotech is headed.

Mendelson, Partner, Cooley Godward "I rank BioCentury at the top of the pile when it comes to covering issues affecting biotechnology in Washington." -- Marc Ostro, Analyst, UBS Securities "BioCentury is essential because it keeps me abreast of the U.S. trends.

It's where we consummate deals and continue to grow in this difficult environment." -- Graham Strachan, President & CEO, Allelix Biopharmaceuticals Inc.

It's a market research report, and strategic business consulting report, delivered to your office every Monday morning." -- Thomas Wiggans, President & CEO, Connective Therapeutics Inc.

Nisshinbo California Inc. Nisshinbo Europe B.V. Date Established: February 5, 1907 Legal Form: Corporation Public Corporate Overview: Nisshinbo Industries, Inc. was founded in 1907 as a manufacturer of cotton yarns and threads, and quickly assumed a position of leadership in the industry. The Company's history has been characterized by strategic moves taken in advance of competitors and designed to raise productivity, improve quality and add value--all in response to customers' needs. Today, Nisshinbo is a total textiles manufacturer, controlling operations from spinning to finishing. This gives the Company and advantage in the development of truly distinctive products and in quality control. Through the application in other fields of technologies and expertise originally accumulated in the textiles area, Nisshinbo has diversified its operations into the manufacture of automobile brakes, machine tools, polyurethane foams, paper products, and label printing operations. Non-textile business now accounts for almost 40% of net sales and the intension is to increase this share to 50% or more within a context of overall growth. Nisshinbo has targeted certain strategic products to form the basis of this growth: VAF (value-added finishing) products, including the best-selling SUPER SOFT PEACHPHASE, new-generation anti-lock braking and traction control systems, CNC machine tools, and non-fluorocarbon polyurethane foam. All are supported by the Company's advanced production technologies, feature high added-value, and have excellent prospects for growth. Nisshinbo has a sound financial structure, a highly skilled work force and a management with a proven record of success. Nisshinbo also has an unrivaled reputation for its ability to satisfy customers. That's why Nisshinbo faces the future with confidence. In June 1994, Mr. Tatsuo Tanabe became chirman of Nisshinbo. Mr. Akihiro Mochizuki was appointed president. Management takes this opportuinity to thank Mr. Tanabe for his leadership in his eight-year term as president, during which he set a strategic guideline for Nisshinbo in the direction of appropriate diversification into value-added products. This is a course that Nisshinbo will continue to follow. Financial Results for Fiscal 1994; In fiscal 1994 (April 1, 1993-March 31, 1994), we posted non-consolidated net sales of Y162,410 million (US$1,624 million), 9.5% down from fiscal 1993. Operation income was Y2,317 million (US$23 million), a decrease of 15.1%. Net income was Y2,934 million (US$29 million), down 57.9%. Unlike in fiscal 1993, we did not sell fixed assets to bolster net income. Capital Investment; Capital expenditure for fiscal 1994 totaled Y10,389 million (US$104 million), a decrease of 32.8% from fiscal 1993. This decline reflects our concentration on expanding production capacity and updating production facilities for products with good prospects. The major items of expenditure were further expansion of friction materials production capacity at the Tatebayashi Plant, the same for disc brake production capacity at the Nagoya Plant, reinforcing finishing processing for SS and SSP at the Miai Plant, and modernization of the Hamamatsu Plant and other spinning and weaving plants. In fiscal 1995, we plan to increase investment by about 70%, again focusing on facilities for successful products. International Activities; Export sales amounted to Y13,268 million (US$133 million), down 23.4%. The main cause of the drop was the appreciation of the yen. The export ratio was 8.2%, a decrease of 1.5 points. Textile exports suffered badly, but sales of non-textiles were slightly up. We conducted two important technical tie-up agreements during fiscal 1994. Under an agreement with ITT Automotive Europe GmbH, NT20 will be marketed through ITT's international network and also by ourselves. Our agreement with Bankok Spring Industrial Co., Ltd. allows the Thai company to manufacture and assemble brake components using Nisshinbo technologies. This is the fourth and the most significant technology transfer agreement with Asian countries.

The Crisis of the Two Party System by Jarvis Tyner This article was reprinted from the August 1995 issue of Political Affairs. For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. The 1996 presidential race is well on its way. It is taking place at a time when the danger from the right is very great, when tens of millions of working-class families are experiencing hard economic times, at a time when the rights and well-being of all working people, especially the racially oppressed, are under attack. Alienation from the two dominant capitalist parties is at an all-time high. A majority of the 18-and-over population is not voting. Millions of American voters are electorally homeless. Over one-third are presently registered independent, and the idea of a third party is supported by a majority of the people. Among African American voters support for a third party is in the high 70-percent range and growing. In most polls well over a majority of trade unionists think we need a pro-working-class third party. Putting aside right-wing third-party forms, there are presently numerous efforts by progressive forces -- nationally, regionally and locally -- to bring about and build third-party formations. Tens of thousands vote for and have joined various left-wing and progressive third-party formations. National parties like the Greens and the New Party are successfully fielding candidates for office. Labor Party Advocates (LPA) has signed up tens of thousands of supporters, mostly trade unionists, and are planning to hold a founding convention in 1996. This movement has real support, but is struggling with the question of whether to run candidates and how to build in the communities as well as among trade unionists. Other groups are busy organizing, networking and calling conferences. There are also many independent forces that are active within the Democratic Party who want to see a third party come about and are ready to cooperate with such a formation. They have seen the way the right wing took over the Republican Party in state after state and gained dominance in Congress by working in the grassroots, outside as well as within the Republican Party structure. They appreciate the positive impact that an active, viable, labor-based, multi-racial people's party pushing from the left would have. They don't quite see how to bring it about, but are ready to help if they can. At the same time they are concerned that this not take away from their efforts to defeat the ultra-right danger and the effort to put the best possible people into elected office today. Real vs. phony independence - Real independence means more than independence of the parties of big business -- it must include independence from the policies of big business first and foremost. That is why conservative forces such as those associated with the Patriot Party and Ross Perot -- though he received a lot of legitimate independent votes in 1992 -- do not represent real independence. Similarly with the prospect of a bid for the presidency by Colin Powell -- while he speaks of being independent he is closely tied in with monopoly capital, particularly the military-industrial complex. Rather, we're talking about labor forces, elected officials and active voters in the African American, Mexican American and Puerto Rican communities. We are talking about peace, anti-racist, senior, women, youth and student, environmental activists -- these are the real independents who want an alternative to an electoral system dominated by the two parties of big business. They want a party that's on the side of the people, where they can elect progressives and fight on issues in an honest and principled way. They must be seen as progressive independents. Communists are active in the various progressive third-party formations. We see the need for a broad, national, mass electoral party where diverse progressive trends can increase their strength, work together and win. At the same time, such a formation does not and cannot replace the Communist Party. The Communist Party has a long and heroic history of running candidates nationally and in localities across the country -- and in some cases being elected. There is a Communist electoral constituency in America that can be built on and expanded. The Communist Party, however, has a revolutionary working-class program that transcends electoral struggles and deals with the need to change society as a whole. Its candidates not only present immediate solutions to today's problems but bring forward a Marxist-Leninist outlook and present more fundamental class solutions up to and including socialism. We are a contributing stream in the mighty river of progressive politics in America today. We have good working relations with numerous independent grassroots political formations around the country who are involved in building independence from the ground up. Communist Party Chairman Gus Hall recently pointed out, "Building a nationwide mass progressive peoples party is going to happen sooner or later." The U.S. body politic is pregnant with the idea of the need to build a third, people's party. The deeper the crisis of capitalism, the fewer solutions the capitalist parties have and therefore the stronger the third-party trend becomes. While a united third party may not be immediately realizable, we believe a united progressive third-party movement is realizable now. And it must be worked for now. The question is, what needs to be done in order to help guarantee the best preconditions so that the birth will be a success, and that what is born is what the people need and want, and not another form that is basically running interference for the ruling class? For one thing, what is needed is greater working unity of the progressive independent forces. No one trend is strong enough or diverse enough to meet the national challenge alone. Finding the forms for broad working unity is key. A proposal is circulating -- Presently there is a lot of discussion taking place on how to unite independents. There is a proposal for action that comes from friendly independent forces and that we are circulating and discussing. It requires the fullest input from our Party membership and leadership. It is an important proposal. We favor it because it calls for bringing together all of the independents -- including those still within the Democratic Party -- based on issues, and to struggle particularly against the right-wing danger and around the growing economic and civil rights emergency in the country. We favor it because we think independents should come together to support progressive jobs legislation, like the Martinez public works jobs bill (HR 1591), and agree to run candidates all across the country based on a progressive program. We think independents should end their rivalries and pledge to cooperate and not oppose each other. We think independents should agree to launch a united national effort to democratize the electoral system by making it easier to get on the ballot and by eliminating the influence of big corporate money through campaign finance reform -- conservative independents are also involved in this fight. We think independents should come together to agree on a list of ultra-right elected officials to run united independent candidates against (labor can play a big role in this regard). Independents should come together to defend motor voter legislation and promote more democratic methods of elections like proportional representation. We are for grassroots local, statewide and regional conferences, as well as a national conference called together on the basis of action not philosophy. All of this has to be related not only to the goal of a people's party but also to the need to defeat the ultra right in the '96 elections. Role of the Communists - Our party has a role to play in this historic process of building towards a people's party. In local areas we are running as Communists for public office. But we must not rule out a presidential ticket -- which I will discuss later. Besides running our own candidates, we must contribute to advancing the broad movement for political independence overall. Independent forces also have a role to play in the immediate 1995 and '96 elections. Like a lot of other forces, Communists must help figure out how to move things forward and positively affect short-term and long-term developments. This is a difficult challenge, especially when 14 months from now we face a presidential election with such a strong danger from the right. We must enter this 1996 electoral struggle in a very active way. Our role is very much needed. We must help clarify the issues and link them to mass fightback. We must help build unity and increase the confidence of those involved in the fight. For example, the fight for the Martinez bill would not be complete without having candidates strongly advocate it. We are in a very complicated situation tactically. The level of organization and unity of the people's independent forces is far behind what is needed. The sentiments among the working-class masses at the grassroots are beyond the policies of not only the Democratic and Republican parties, but beyond most progressive independent organizations as well. In reading ultra-right and Republican Party material, it's clear that the enemy is fully aware of the potential for change and is out to block and misdirect real independence. They are well financed, well organized and in motion. While different independent forces might agree on basics, there are real differences -- real contradictions between those working on various levels of the broad progressive movement for independence. Our role is very much needed to help find the ways to build unity and help move things forward. We must move quickly. Danger from the right -- As we said, the 1996 election struggle is well on its way. The right-wing Republicans are out not only to hold their own but to win the White House and increase their majority position in the Congress. They are working for a situation where they will control the judicial, legislative and executive branches of government. Powerful forces in the ruling class want a situation where passage of their reactionary program is virtually guaranteed. That's why we must accelerate the fight to advance political independence. Just recently William Bennett, himself a reactionary Republican, accused presidential candidate Pat Buchanan of "flirting with fascism." Buchanan is more than flirting in my view. We must not forget that there is a fascist element out there -- not just the KKK, skinheads and Nazis, but forces with a powerful influence in the Republican Party. As it is, the right-wing measures already being proposed and implemented have created an economic as well as a civil rights emergency in the nation. The recent racist Supreme Court decisions against affirmative action sounds the alarm. This needs to be seen in relation to the anti-immigrant Proposition 187, the effects of a long-term racist propaganda campaign against affirmative action as well as all entitlements, and the vicious attempts to eliminate welfare. These decisions codify the blame-the-victim big lie and open the floodgates -- not only for more racist attacks but attacks on labor's right as well. The ruling class is out to split the working class to make it easier to further worsen our conditions of life. As their real program is being exposed, the right-wing Republicans who now dominate the Senate and House are losing mass support, but they remain confident they can defeat Clinton in '96 because they do not count on the grassroots of working people being mobilized and organized. Clinton's tendency is to cooperate with the Contract forces. Efforts like his joint appearance with Gingrich in New Hampshire are his preferred direction. However, he can be moved. His speech supporting affirmative action shows that despite his politically conservative outlook he can be forced in a better direction. But if he continues to push his balancing-the-budget and other conservative programs, his chances of building a winning electoral coalition by November '96 are slim. For one thing he will build the abstention trend among democratic voters. We want to score a major defeat of the right in '96 because the alternative is unacceptable. As bad as it is now, it could get worse. A right-wing dominance of all three branches of government would mean a terrible road ahead for the people. Advocating the third-party option alone is not an adequate answer. We should not use efforts towards future strategic goals to run away from present tactical challenges. The economic and civil rights emergency of today has to be top priority in all we do. Lesser Evil -- As the right gets stronger, the lesser-of-two-evils dilemma becomes stronger too. Basically it is structured into all politics under capitalism. After almost a year of the 104th Congress, the idea of the lesser evil is influencing many voters today. Its impact cannot be ignored; it will influence the 1996 elections. A lot of people are suffering and want relief. The best way to achieve long-term relief is to build a powerful independent movement and party -- yet such a party cannot be built devoid of struggle against the right danger. The best way to meet the lesser-evil problem is to establish a "better good" alternative. The big tactical challenge is how far we can go down the road to advancing the building of a "better good" as we meet the challenges of today. Simply tailing the Democrats is not the way. The pressures to do that, especially in the presidential race, are very great because the prospects of building a viable national "better good" are more difficult. But in local and congressional races there are signs that many real independent challenges can be initiated and won. Real victories are possible in 1996 if we understand that, even with the lesser-evil problem most sharply expressed on the level of the presidential race, it is still possible to pressure that election to the left, defeat many right-wing candidates and programs on a local, state and congressional levels, and that these local fights can have a positive impact on the whole electoral struggle. Finding tactics that will move the people is key. New Independent Trends -- There are some new trends out there that show that independence is gaining strength. Along with the positive results experienced by those building third-party formations -- especially those who are building from the bottom up -- there are signs that political independence is gaining support among organized strategic forces. The willingness to defy the Democratic Party hierarchy, reject the machine and move outside the two-party system is gaining broader acceptance. The idea of running candidates as independents, including for president, is widely accepted now; it's not considered a "way out" thing to do anymore. After Clinton's latest budget betrayals which undermined the whole fight against the Contract in Congress and strengthened the right, many progressive forces in the Democratic Party were enraged and openly talked about a break with Clinton. The pressures for Jesse Jackson to run have gotten very strong. At the recent Rainbow meeting in Atlanta, the slogan "Run Jesse Run" reemerged. At a July '95 meeting sponsored by Essence magazine in New Orleans, according to the Wall Street Journal the African American leaders there were generally of the opinion that if President Clinton continues moving to the right with such initiatives as his balanced budget and affirmative action review, distancing himself from the leadership of minority and women's organization and other liberals, "Mr. Jackson will feel obligated to run. And if the president fights for their agenda, he won't run ..." The same article quoted Jackson as saying, "We will not sit idly by and watch the great gains of the past evaporate." Jackson's aides say that they are studying their options, including the possibility of running as an independent in the general election. This idea is getting a lot of support, including among some Congressional Democrats. Incumbents are saying that among their constituents, Jackson's being at the top of the ticket would help them more then sharing a ticket with Clinton. As of this writing, Jackson has not committed himself. The main tactic at this point seems to be to apply maximum pressure from the left. That is a good tactic and is having an impact on Clinton. Labor - In the labor movement there is growing alienation from the Democrats. Of great importance is the fact that in the platform of both groups vying to replace Kirkland as head of the AFL-CIO, there is a totally new position regarding support of political independence of labor. This trend is all over the labor movement. At the recent Coalition of Black Trade Unionists (CBTU) convention, First Vice President Willie Baker said that Black workers are no longer the "plow horse" for the Democratic Party. They are saying, "no more carte blanche." Candidates will be supported based on issues and "let the chips fall where they may." In labor, especially in the leadership circles, there is strong pressure that says labor must support Clinton, despite the disappointments, due to the danger from the right. Such pressure is enormous on the level of the presidential race; at the same time, many more top trade union leaders today are ready and willing to break with the machine on the level of local and congressional candidates. The continued anger in the ranks of labor over the Democrats' betrayal around NAFTA, GATT and the Worker Replacement Bill is creating a more favorable climate, especially for the Sweeney slate. The pressure for change in basic policy in the AFL-CIO is enormous right now. This could be a decisive factor in the coming elections if mobilized. The platform of the Sweeney group calls for a "new labor movement" and states, "While we must reach out and embrace other progressive forces for change, we must above all build our own power by creating a strong grassroots political voice for working people in this country." Sweeney says that the labor movement needs to "exact a price" from candidates before endorsing them for public office. This view was frantically attacked by Al Shanker, showing a growing desperation among conservative labor leaders. Speaking at the recent Jobs with Justice conference, George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers, called for shifting labor's money to elect workers to Congress. Can these openings be a basis for building local coalitions of independent forces around supporting united labor candidates for Congress? The power that the new mergers will bring to the labor movement cannot be overemphasized. Greater clout in political action is one of the important reasons given for the merger of the Textile unions and the mega-merger of the Auto Workers, Machinists and Steelworkers. These are new openings for approaching labor. Another challenge is around the recent racist Supreme Court decisions against redistricting. Can independent forces help build broad-based coalitions of all the independent forces in response? Why not coalitions that would work to guarantee the re-election of Congresswomen Cynthia McKinney and Nydia Velazquez? This could be linked to establishing a national list of 20 to 30 extreme right-wing Congressmen to target for defeat. The Abstention Factor - More and more, the ruling class relies on the abstention of millions of working-class voters to guarantee the election of reactionaries. The abstention factor is determining the outcome of most elections today. As we said, tens of millions of voters do not identify with either the Republican or Democratic parties. In the 1992 presidential election no candidate received a majority. Clinton received a plurality. Over 19 million voters -- about 19 percent -- voted for the "independent" candidate and billionaire businessman Ross Perot. In the 1994 mid-term elections only about 38 percent of the electorate came out. While they won a lot of races, the Republicans actually won by default. The overwhelming majority of voters decided not to vote, leaving the field open for the more conservative section of the electorate, and those most taken in by right-wing demagogy, to determine the outcome. In that and other elections the right has a power far beyond its actual numerical strength. Increasingly with the capitulations and moves to the right by the Democratic Party, the working-class majority of the electorate is opting for a "no confidence, no vote" tactic. The danger of this approach is that, by default, it is leaving the field open to domination by a minority of voters who are wealthy reactionaries. The answer cannot be simply to work harder to get folks to register and vote. The abstention trend is not only a vote against the two dominant parties but is rooted in the growing lack of confidence in capitalism itself. The answer must include advancing the struggle for peace, jobs, justice and equality. It must include the struggle to promote people's candidates, to create a democratic progressive alternative to build the greater good, so that the people will have something to vote for. It's becoming clear that constant, defensive appeals to come out to vote do not hold a lot of sway with large numbers of voters. More is needed. The Class Issue Is Key - According to a recent survey conducted by Curtis Gans of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, 60 percent of persons with incomes of $50,000 or more voted in 1994, up from 59.2 percent four years prior. Only 19.9 percent of those with incomes under $5,000 came out, down from 32.2 percent. For voters making $5,000 to $10,000 a year, only 23.3 percent voted compared to 30.9 percent previously. The study found that while 46.9 percent of whites said they voted, which was an increase from 1990, only 37 percent of African-Americans and 19.1 percent of those classified Hispanic came out. In each case that was a decrease from 1990. As our Party has said, the outcome in the '94 elections was not due to an ideological shift to the right by the working-class majority, as some continue to claim, but rather because the active electorate in 1994 tended to be high-income conservative voters. Yet some use the same results to keep pushing the "angry white men" notion. This idea is pushed in order to hide the class issue and encourage and justify racism. The aim is to take the justifiable anger of white workers toward the system and its ruling class, and misdirect it towards non-white workers. Most opinion polls show that there has been no rightward shift by working people. As I said earlier, as the class essence of the right wing's program is more and more exposed, those who advocate the Contract are losing support. Helping to popularize a class understanding is key to unity in advancing political independence and in defeating the ultra right in the coming elections. For example, while a majority supports a balanced budget and lower taxes, they do not support or trust the likes of Newt Gingrich. And when you get to the specifics of what is to be cut to "balance the budget," a majority do not support the anti-working-class, racist measures proposed by the right wing to achieve it. To support these measures is to support more massive giveaways to the rich at the expense of the people. There is a strong class revulsion against these policies. Cutting the military budget, cutting "wealthfare" (entitlements for the rich) and taxing the rich are all popular, majority ideas among masses of working people. Even among Republicans, those presidential candidates who continue to emphasize the right-wing economic proposals in the Contract are falling behind those who have shifted to so-called moral issues. How To Proceed - Basically what is needed is greater unity of the independent forces working on all levels of the movement for independent politics. This includes sections of labor, African Americans and Latinos, third-party movements, those working to democratize the electoral process and forces who are still organizationally inside the Democratic Party but whose politics are independent and to the left of the dominant forces in the party. This includes grassroots activists, leaders of mass organizations and elected officials. In the proposal that our Party is in agreement with, there are a number of ideas to build on. For example, independents could come together to agree on a program to convince candidates to run on. One of the most exciting ideas would be that everyone -- no matter whether they support the Greens, LPA, the New Party, or if they are a reform Democrat or a Communist -- all agree to support the same candidates for public office. The proposal projects holding a series of local meetings or conferences to help lay the basis for building for a national conference. The purpose of local conferences is to develop local action programs around the economic and civil rights emergency. They could be organized around targeting particular extreme-right candidates for defeat. Take Connecticut, where there have been some excellent examples of successful grassroots electoral independence. It is a state where the economic emergency is very severe, and where Governor Rowland is trying to destroy welfare and privatization is high on his agenda. There are municipal elections this year and most independent forces are involved. In New Haven they are working to put a jobs bill referendum on the ballot. In other cities they are working on the municipal elections. They are organizing for a real fight this year. Can there be a coming-together of independent forces to organize and coordinate their efforts? In New Mexico a very important national Green Party conference was held. Our party's presence was welcomed by the many independent activist who were there. Virginia Brodine, chair of our environmental commission, took part in a workshop and on a panel of third parties representing our party. She was very well received. We also set up a very successful Party literature table. Our comrades who attended the Green Party conference in Washington D.C. last month were also warmly welcomed by its organizers. In general, our presence at third-party movement events is appreciated and often openly acknowledged. Many forces may not agree with us on every issue but they respect our contributions, our experiences and our outlook for a socialist future. In California, defense of motor voter laws, defeating the affirmative action referendum and the ongoing struggle to overturn Proposition 187 are at the center of the electoral struggle. With so many third-party forces there, it would seem that some form of getting together around a concrete issue is possible. In Oregon there will be a referendum on proportional representation on the Eugene ballot. In New York, the economic emergency is very severe with the presence of a right-wing Republican mayor in New York City and a right-wing Republican governor in Albany -- the elections must be linked to the growing fightback. Certainly in Ohio -- not only with Rick Nagin in Cleveland but in Youngstown/ Warren in particular -- we ought to have a Communist candidate to offer all those households who received our message during the homecoming activities a chance to vote for the party of Gus Hall. Thus, all around the country the question is: what can be initiated among various independent forces on a local level to use the elections to advance the fightback? What can be done to strengthen the fight for the Martinez bill vis-a-vis the coming elections? This must be a period where hundreds of labor, African American, Latino, youth, women and senior progressive independents are challenging for public office. The real independents must come to the fore. Communist Candidates - As I said, we must be prepared to launch Communist candidates for public office in the 1996 elections in as many states and districts as possible. At this point, a goal should be for at least one candidate in every Party district. I think the time is ripe for running Young Communist League members for office as well. Youth candidates have a special appeal, particularly when voter alienation is so high. We also must not rule out running for president. In fact we must examine all the technical requirements for running a presidential slate. The Jackson forces say that it is fairly easy in 27 states. What should we do? For one thing, we could at least go for a number of key states in order to have a voice in the very important national debate. In the course of these electoral activities, the opportunities are very great to build our party and press, and broaden the Party's contact with independent forces, elected officials and especially rank-and-file activists. Electoral activities have always been an excellent way to build the Party. This could accelerate our mass recruitment in the streets. The situation calls for a higher level of unity of the independent forces and a more coordinated relationship between them. With such unity it will be much more possible to defeat the right and build towards a mass national people's party. While we favor political independence all the way up to the presidential race, if there is not a mass united independent candidate for president we will still be building pressure from the grassroots. We should keep in mind that while an independent progressive presidential challenge may be difficult to realize in 1996, by the year 2000 -- after electing a lot of independents on the local and Congressional levels especially -- it would be a natural. The objective possibility is that by that time, we could be in a position to build a strong coalition people's party, greatly democratize the electoral process in America and launch a formidable challenge to the old parties of big business -- not only at the point of production, on the street and on campus, but at the ballot box as well. So let us take today's challenge very seriously, and take it to others, and help make the breakthroughs that are so possible in this period a reality.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PAcredits. In June of this year, the Labor Department issued figures on productivity and wages that were so alarming they should have been featured in newspaper headlines and network TV newscasts across the country. Robert Reich, Secretary of the Labor Department which chronically under stresses the true state of affairs where the working class is concerned, reported to the New York Times that there "has been a shift from earned to unearned income, from paychecks to dividends and capital gains." The Times was worried enough to devote an editorial to the subject in which it warned that if this trend continued, "the consequences could be explosive." The Times went on to note that while wages fell by 2.3 percent (and have been falling for more than two decades) and benefits (health, vacations, pensions, etc.) were cut by 3 percent, "productivity -- output per hour of work -- shot up by 2 percent last year and by a gaudy 2.7 annual rate at the beginning of this year ... Profits," it continues, "are near record levels and stock prices have surged 15 percent since January." A bit uneasy about the implications of its own quoted figures, the Times equivocates: "By some measures, these are beautiful times." Obviously, not the measure of working men and women. For workers these figures translate into less food on the table and a sharp decline in living standards. With increasing attacks on "safety net" provisions, the average worker today stands in the greatest peril since the early Depression days. Practically every day now you can pick up a newspaper at random and read something like the following: The MCI Communications Corporation, while announcing a 21 percent rise in earnings, said yesterday that it would restructure the company, dismissing 2,500 to 3,000 employees by the end of the year.... (New York Times, Aug. 3, 1995) What's going on? How has it been possible for workers to get into a situation where the harder they work, the more they produce, the less they get paid? Even worse: the more they produce in a shorter and shorter period, the fewer of them are needed. And so many find themselves "downsized," unemployed, redundant, "too young to die, too old to work." It's absolute insanity -- even from the point of view of corporate America which must realize this process is killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Or is there a delusion among them that they can go on forever driving workers to produce more and more and pay less and less? Ironically enough, the historic accomplishment of the New Deal of over 60 years ago -- which the Republican Yahoos of today want to dismantle -- are precisely the cushions which have prevented "explosions" of the type the New York Times fears and the removal of which will put them back on the political agenda. The drive to disaster seems programmed. Finance capital is driven to produce higher and higher profits by the very nature of the system, even though that is the one-way ticket to suicide. Maximum profits is hailed as the law of the land, despite the fact that the mills and factories are literally slaughtering workers, currently at the rate of one killed roughly every hour and a half. This adds up to over a million U.S. workers killed on the job since the 1920s. The words of author Edison Bowers in 1930 hold true: "The workshop is more dangerous than the battlefield." Big business has no interest in the worker as a human being, but only as a source of profit. Indeed, corporate bosses have no interest even in the goods their factories produce -- of which they know nothing -- only in profit. Production is a pretext, not an end. If producing frogs legs made a better profit than making steel, the steel mills would be close up in an instant to make room for frogs. Big Banks run the economy and today are identical with the government, which has degenerated into nothing more than its obedient servant ready to gratify its every wish, including openly transforming the armed forces into bill collectors on delinquent customer-countries all over the world. Although by its nature capitalism always exerts force to lower wages to the level of subsistence -- its ideal is the worker who is paid just enough to maintain his or her ability to work and reproduce -- the course of labor history shows that workers can create a counter force even greater by means of militant labor action. But militant labor action is exactly what was missing from the top leadership of labor which presided with remarkable complacency over the decline of the labor movement from the merger of the CIO and AFL in 1955. Small wonder that only some 15 percent of the working class is organized into trade unions. The leadership of the AFL-CIO under George Meany and Lane Kirkland was governed by the notion so loudly proclaimed by the late David Dubinsky, lifetime president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, that "unionism needs capitalism like a fish needs water." As a consequence of this kind of class collaborationist thinking, labor almost completely forfeited the independent political posture of the working class. Workers have few voices to speak on their behalf in Congress or state legislatures, many of which have passed right-to-work laws that did serious damage to the labor movement in those states. Labor has no daily press, no face to show the public on TV. Hollywood, which has slandered workers almost since its birth, only now and then produces a movie that reflects the reality of workers' lives. Labor has been hemmed in and hobbled by a series of laws, including Taft-Hartley, Landrum-Griffin, the reversal of the Norris-LaGuardia anti-injunction law -- all of it culminating in the "hollowing out" of the National Labor Relations Board so that only the face remains. The right and power to call strikes has been severely curtailed, not only with devices like the mandatory 60-day "cooling off" period (as though strikes were called in the heat of passion rather than as the last resort), limiting the number of pickets a union can employ and how close they can come to the place being picketed, forbidding "secondary" picketing and boycotts, and so on. Judges can and increasingly do levy huge fines against unions and issue injunctions that effectively break strikes. On occasion Congress, if "stirred up," can and has passed laws breaking a strike by forcing the workers to return to work. The president too has the power to break a strike, as President Reagan (a.k.a. T-10, his code number when he was an informer for the FBI and president of the Screen Actors Guild as well) proved when he broke the Air Traffic Controllers union in 1981. The notorious "amendment" to the bankruptcy laws -- the so-called Chapter 11 -- makes it possible for a company unwilling to pay decent wages, or wanting to get out from under pension, health and vacation obligations, to declare "bankruptcy" and then legally cancel all such contracts and obligations, and "reorganize" itself shorn of previous commitments. Thousands of workers have lost wages and benefits by this device. When whole companies arbitrarily shut down, as did the steel industry in Western Pennsylvania,, Ohio and Illinois, workers suffered enormous losses. Almost overnight their homes -- into which they had invested not only their hard-earned wages but much of their lives -- lost value; some had to be abandoned as the owners were forced to look for work elsewhere. What we see in this portrait of the American working class is the "market economy" at its very best. Attempts to revive it with NAFTAs, GATTs and other opiate dreams are calculated to shift the cost of a mammoth redistribution of wealth in the world onto the backs not only of Third World workers but of American workers as well. They will have their short run of hope and illusion and ultimately collapse, leaving the situation even worse than when they found it. There is only one "cure" for the evils of capitalism and it still is socialism -- no doubt a more mature and wiser socialism than before, but socialism nevertheless. Life is a pitiless master but it rewards those who master its lessons. History is not over. It has just begun. The class struggle has not lessened. It has intensified. Meanwhile, labor is under direct attack and must defend itself. Part and parcel of the attack are the actions of Congress, the Supreme Court and the White House annulling and reversing certain key advances in the struggle of African Americans, Latinos and other minorities. These attacks must not be seen in isolation from the simultaneous attacks on the rights of labor in general. Killing affirmative action, cutting projects like Head Start, outlawing electoral districts that allow for African Americans as well as Latinos to be represented in Congress and in state legislatures are aimed against economic interests as well as civil rights. Affirmative action is tied directly into jobs, Head Start and other projects into training for jobs. Political representation is an economic question as well. Low wages for any section of labor has the effect of lowering the wages of all labor. Our country cannot survive half-union and half non-union. The old union slogan still applies -- an injury to one is an injury to all. Serious as the situation is for the laboring masses, it is far from hopeless. On the contrary, the signs are multiplying that the long period of setbacks for the working class is definitely over. The brazen, arrogant assault on the hard-won rights of the workers that has been launched in Congress has been a wake-up call to all of labor and all progressive forces in the country, ranging from feminists to environmentalists, who are under attack. In fact, a natural, objective united front of such forces has risen and is taking shape. We are at the beginning of a new phase in the struggle of democratic America for its birthright -- for its native, homegrown, people's America. There are many impressive straws in the winds of change. That Lane Kirkland had to resign while still in office is one of them. Before him the AFL had only three presidents in over 100 years. None resigned, none were defeated in elections, and all lived to a ripe old age. To be forced to resign while still in office is tantamount to a preliminary tremor that presages an earthquake to come. Another hefty straw in the wind was the extraordinary reception that the AFL-CIO steelworkers local in Warren, Ohio extended to Gus Hall last July. Only yesterday, as time goes, Communists were driven out of office in the AFL-CIO and some locals even refused to accept them as members. To turn the town inside out welcoming the biggest Communist of them all is something nobody could have predicted only months ago! Another positive note is the unification of three major unions -- the United Steelworkers, Auto Workers and the International Association of Machinists. In so doing, the labor movement takes a big step toward reversing the flaws and weaknesses it developed since the Cold War dismantling of the CIO. It will also help accelerate other mergers in labor -- construction, railroads and teachers come immediately to mind. Added to that is the new, militant note sounded by John Sweeney, who heads the "New Voices for American Workers" ticket in opposition to the official slate, pledging the unions to "recreate a labor movement that will improve the lives of working people, not just protect them from current assaults." He promises to build "a new progressive political movement. We will remind CEOs and the right-wing zealots in public office that disrespecting working people is a one-way road to hell." Linda Chavez-Thompson, running for AFL-CIO executive vice-president on the New Voices ticket said during a recent rally in Chicago that the new labor leadership would "change the face of labor. It will be my face. It will be your face." And Richard Trumka, head of the Miners union who is running for secretary-treasurer, told the same rally, "We cannot win by running and hiding but only by standing together and fighting together." It's an entirely new ball game. The slate is being wiped clean of the do-nothing, class collaborationist past. Old illusions, fears and false hopes are being shed. It's a new working class we see today -- more militant, more united, more class conscious, and more left in it outlook. These developments are so basic that Gus Hall recently pointed to the beginnings of a new period in U.S. political life -- an era in which the working class comes front and center into shaping the direction of the class struggle. All developments will from now on relate in one way or another to this new factor. Already the ruling class has begun to make adjustments. Witness Clinton's recent speech on affirmative action in which he said the program has been good for the country. Witness his sharpened attacks on the Republican budget. Witness most importantly the blunting of the right-wing offensive. The ultra-right drive to force the Contract on America down the throat of the country is beginning to slow down and lose steam in the face of mounting resistance from the people. Workers, Black, white and Brown are angry and are beginning to take action. And where the working class goes so goes the rest of the country. A working-class explosion is brewing below. It's unstoppable. It's inevitable. It will change America.

This must be seen as a victory, not a defeat. While such an assessment may seem to make a positive out of a negative, the facts speak for themselves. Let's look at the history of this health care reform effort. As the old adage says, "those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it." After extensive public hearings, the Clintons introduced their very "moderate" health bill in the fall of 1993. Progressives immediately saw the weaknesses in this bill, especially its pro-insurance company bias, but publicly withheld their criticisms. This period of time required having a flexible approach to the Clinton program, even though everyone knew the president's legislation must be improved. While continuing to garner supporters for the single-payer legislation, they struggled to improve the Clinton bill through intensive lobbying and political struggle. But by early 1994 it became clear that the Clintons and their congressional supporters were hell-bent on passing any legislation, regardless of its content. By that time, the handwriting was on the wall. That "compromise for passage" approach of the White House and congressional leaders sent a very clear message to the health care profiteers. "We won't fight you," rather, "we will work with you in getting a bill that you favor passed." In fact, the White House, along with the Senate's collection of George Mitchells and Pat Moynihans, would not pass any legislation that did not have monopoly's support. Significantly, the House Democrats, with the exception of the single-payer leaders, took a back seat during the whole process. Each of these House members knew they had to face re-election in the fall of 1994. They were caught between health industry campaign contributions and the desires of their constituents. By this time, Clinton had revealed his true colors with the crude tactics he used to win passage of NAFTA. As the summer of 1994 approached, the Clinton administration's reputation was at an all-time low among labor and community people. From late winter through spring, the mad grab for profits and power became painfully clear when Met Life combined its health-profit business with The Travelers. Metrahealth, the new corporate name, anticipates a customer base of 13 million and $17.6 billion in revenue. Two of the "Big 5" leaders in the insurance industry saw the future and acted accordingly. The "smaller" insurance carriers in the Health Insurance Association of America, who are not among the Big Five, scrambled for their market share. Fearing they would be left out of legislation, they conducted an advertising campaign against the White House proposals. This campaign, which cost over $15 million, was credited with putting a lethal knife in the heart of health care reform. It is important to understand the reasons why the campaign succeeded. The ad campaign demagogically raised legitimate questions in people's minds such as how do you guarantee universal health care in a system run by the insurance and drug monopolies? The ad campaign cleverly played on this sentiment. The campaign of the "smaller" insurance companies was effective with the mass media and some leading members of Congress. It galvanized the anti-reform forces to increase their activities against any government involvement. The "Big Five" didn't shed any tears, since they knew they were on the winning side in any game being proposed by the White House. They would garner the lion's share of the profits, regardless of the current legislative outcome. It appeared that the Big Five would have settled for a Medicare-style bill that would guarantee these giant corporations super-profits. As third-party intermediaries, the insurance carriers do very well under a program modeled after the current Medicare program. In order to gain their support, the White House assured these insurance monopolies a level of super profits, similar to their third-party role in Medicare. In spite of the attacks on health care reform, polls continued to show the people's confidence in government involvement in health financing and delivery. Opinion polls expressed satisfaction with government insurance programs such as Federal Social Security, Federal Social Disability Insurance, Medicare, Unemployment Insurance and even, to some extent, Workers' Compensation. Many veterans still rely on their federal veterans benefits, including what is left of the veteran hospital system. Compared to their horrid experience with the private insurance company system, the choice was obvious. The hatred of the private insurance carriers remains at an all-time high. These polls were deliberately kept out of the public eye. Editorialists from the New York Times to commercial television continually supported the most conservative congressional legislation. They constantly heaped uncritical praise on privatization proposals. Politicians, however, were well aware of the public sentiment for national health care. While they wouldn't stand up to their friends in the corporate health care industry, they also feared incurring the wrath of the voters. This was the main reason for the failure of Congress to act. Even with all the power and wealth of the transnational health monopolies, Congress was forced not to pass a pro-monopoly bill. Monopolization All during this period, major consolidation moves in the profit-making hospital field were taking place. Columbia Health Care (CHC), the country's largest profit chain, bought the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) for $5.6 billion. That chain became even bigger when the Wall Street Journal reported that, on October 6, Columbia/HCA bought Health/Trust Inc. for $3.6 billion in newly-issued stock. This deal, if it holds up, will increase Columbia/HCA to 311 hospitals with 170,00 employees and an estimated $15 billion in annual revenue. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Trade Commission will review the transaction, but there is little doubt that it will be approved. A week after the Columbia/HCA transaction, National Medical Enterprises (NME) bought American Medical Holdings for almost $2 billion. This keeps NME as the second largest for-profit hospital chain with 71 hospitals, 63,200 employees and revenues over $5 billion. NME recently paid a record $380 million to settle federal criminal charges after pleading guilty to six counts of paying kickbacks in the referral of Medicare, patients and one count of conspiracy to make illegal payments. With these previous and current dealings, the profit-making hospital system is clearly yet another monopoly influence peddler throwing its weight around in Congress and in the Clinton administration. Figures Don't Lie, Liars Figure Another feature of the great health care reform period of 1993-94 was the barrage of facts and figures that every side used to push its point. Think tanks on all sides were busy grinding out studies that supported their positions. Clearly, if the playing grounds were level and logic had its day, the objective situation presented by the progressive forces would have prevailed. The extensive public hearings held by Hillary Clinton's Administrative Task Force, during the first part of 1994, pointed the congressional debate toward a progressive conclusion. If there was ever any truth to the adage "Figures don't lie, liars figure" this was the year. But figures were not the only weapons being misused. The redefinition of words took on a whole new level when every player in the game said that their program was "universal." Those assertions were not adequately challenged. When it became clear that everyone in Congress was trying to include a benefit to senior citizens in the form of a Medicare prescription drug program, the transnational drug corporations sprang into action. Since any Medicare prescription drug program would be significantly determined by government regulation, each drug transnational vied for an advantage. One way to gain the most profit was by eliminating the competition. Thus the increasing monopolization of the international drug cartels had a profound effect on the health care debate. The drug transnationals Eli Lilly (PCS Health Systems), Smith Kline and Beecham (the British transnational), Diversified Pharmaceuticals, and Merck (Medco Containment) bought drug purchasing companies so that they, as manufacturers, could control the flow of their drugs. These purchasing companies were set up to arrange the purchase of drugs at discounted prices for employers, labor unions and other large consumers. Billions of dollars changed hands in these transactions. For example, Lilly purchased PCS for $4 billion. This is all the more remarkable since PCS had profits in the low millions. This acquisition will affect over 51 million people or 20 percent of the U.S. population. Lilly's intention was quite clear. Smith Kline and Beecham purchased Diversified for $2.3 billion, and Merck paid $6.6 billion for Medco. In another major drug company transaction, Roche Holding bought Syntax for $5.3 billion. To top off this orgy of billion-dollar transitions, American Home Products bought American Cyanamid for an incredible $8.5 billion. All of these drug manufactures have honed their extensive kickback schemes to physicians and hospitals/health centers to gain an even greater competitive advantage. These kickbacks are the subject of Senate investigation. In the meantime they continue to take place and the general public, especially senior citizens, are being taken advantaged of. The business sections of newspapers were replete with articles about these transactions. To boost this profit direction, the Wall Street Journal's (August 25, 1994) front page story stated, "With Congress Stalled Health Care is Shaped by the Private Sector." To put some brakes on this movement, once the barn door was closed, the Journal cautioned that anti-trust laws were certainly being violated. Therefore, while the insurance companies are often pointed to by some as the culprit for the high costs of health care, other members of the transnational health monopolies are also involved. That includes the drug monopolies, profit-making hospital chains, medical equipment and supply companies and international financial organizations. Self-Destructive Competition All of these outfits were united to kill any progressive legislation. Once they were assured that the White House was not advocating a progressive health bill, each corporation and industrial association set about gaining their own advantage within the context of some kind of federal health legislation. This competitive advantage lobbying sent members of Congress and their staffs into a tizzy. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent in lobbying Congress. Millions were spent in contributions in the 1994 congressional elections. This period of time became a bonanza of money for elected and aspiring politicians and "Beltway" consultants. A September, 1994 Citizen Action report found that the health and insurance industry gave candidates $13.6 million from January through June, 1994, a 96 percent increase over the previous comparable period. This compares to a 10 percent jump in non-health related industry contributions. This new situation gave a conservative compromiser like Clinton headaches. It seemed that a new bipartisan proposal, engineered by combinations of monopoly capital, was coming down the pike every month to satisfy the profiteers. Each proposal pushed the health care debate further to the right and against the health care of everyday people. This bipartisan, monopoly effort contained more Democrats than Republicans. Who said there isn't a dimes worth of difference between the two parties of monopoly? Republican Party policy, led by Senate leader Bob Dole, after initially beginning with the then- obligatory allegiance to "we also want health care reform," easily settled into their more comfortable pro-monopoly position. In this instance, however, the Republicans could sit back and watch the Democrats kill themselves. Contradictions in the drive among competing corporate interests in the drug, insurance, profit-making hospital chains, medical supply and equipment and financial corporations to gain advantage over each other contributed to their own legislative downfall. People's Power: The Decisive Factor The main ingredient in this anti-people, profit lobbying mix that proved to be the decisive factor was the people themselves. As indicated, polls showed the overriding sentiment for a national (universal) system of health care. The single-payer movement developed to carry the fight into the halls of Congress. The leaders of that movement came from important sections of the labor movement and major community groups. It was and remains a broad and effective political movement. Representative Jim McDermott of Washington State (one of only two physicians in Congress) in the House and Senator Paul Wellstone from Minnesota, gave congressional leadership to the movement. Labor and community leaders were relentless in lobbying members of Congress in their home offices or in Washington. Rallies were held in Washington and in every large town voicing the cry, "no profits in health care." The people's message was heard. The movement didn't get what we wanted, but it did stop the health care industry from enacting its own legislation. Given the balance of forces, this must be seen as a peoples' victory. From the outset, the labor movement had two general viewpoints. These viewpoints reflected the two political strains in the organized labor movement in the U.S. One trend generally fights for its members by struggling against monopoly capital, and the other collaborates with big business. The basic difference in the approaches is between class- struggle trade unionism and class collaboration. The collaborationists were lead by AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland. They helped organize and/or joined joint labor and management committees as the way to gain health care reform. Some of these committees even included the insurance companies. White House and Congressional leaders loved this collaboration strategy. They knew that ultimately, after some loud talk, these labor leaders would agree to anything the White House and its corporate supporters would put forward. But progressive and left-of-center international unions did not agree with the Kirkland sellout and fought against it. Kirkland and his right-wing allies fought hard against the anti-profit health care group. While the single-payer movements strength came from the progressive unions, Kirkland's collaboration stopped a united front against the monopolies from being formed. Votes in the AFL-CIO's Health Committee were routinely divided down the middle, eight for single-payer and eight against. There are opportunities to win a few of the latter group away from Kirkland. Single-Payer: a Compromise Itself In his September 5, 1994 speech, McDermott called for an end to the congressional health reform effort since the debate had moved too far toward an anti-people health bill. In his remarks he made an impassioned plea to his corporate constituency. While his stand for the single-payer legislation was more than admirable, he showed his limitations when he said that corporations had nothing to fear from the single-payer proposal. After all, he said, only the financing would be government organized. The delivery of health care, he assured, would remain in private hands. McDermott as much as said that his legislation was not the same as socialized medicine. This is not Great Britain, he argued, it is just like the Canadian system. Physician fee-for-service and private hospitals and clinics were to be preserved. Clearly, he is sending the wrong message - being unfairly critical of a superior health program in order to sell yours is the wrong path to go down. At the turn of 1994, the single-payer movement felt that large corporations, such as the auto industry, would benefit from a single-payer-style approach. The auto manufacturers were looking for a way to reduce or unload their health benefits, averaging about $800 per car, onto the federal treasury. While those positions were stated behind closed doors, these same corporate giants never had a mass media campaign to win their point of view. There are probably too many health industry monopolists on their boards of directors. The argument for socializing the financing of health care carried some weight. And since a significant number of people in this country are already covered through a government-run financing mechanism, this would not be perceived as a radical solution. It all seemed to make sense. The debates at this time were among health-care advocates who were part of the health-care scene for years. The debating lines were drawn and logic seemed to be carrying the day. But a new feature came through in this period when a group organized in 1992-93, called the "Jackson Hole Group," came into the fray. Named for a corporate retreat in Wyoming, the "Jackson Hole Group" represented the concentration of profit power in the health industry. While it seemed to have a distinct U.S. tinge, in fact, it also represented the combined power of transnational health profiteers. At first they were not taken seriously. At the time their crude profits-above-all-else approach seemed so obvious as to render them without any credibility. The "Jackson Hole Group," which brought the crudest form of lobbying to the halls of Congress, saw all too well the logic and effectiveness of the single-payer compromise. Although they saw its value in nudging out the far more progressive and logical method of delivering health care, that is, the British National Health Service ( the financing and delivery system of the BNHS is in government hands, not insurance companies), they waged a fierce campaign to defeat single-payer. Progressive health care advocates remember that in the 1970s Congressman Ronald V. Dellums had proposed a national health service for this country. The largest health care organization in the world, the American Public Health Association, endorsed that proposal. Practitioners in the health care field supported this proposal because it began to deal with the discrimination in the delivery of health care which leads to wide disparity of health status. It also dealt with the unfair financing of health care. Prevention of disease is a main ingredient of a national health service. This legislation is still alive and well. The Communist Party, USA has long endorsed and fought for a fully government-run and financed health care system. But, all of these pro-people forces coalesced behind the single-payer movement, given the tactical and strategic position that it was in. The single-payer proposal was a giant step along the way toward the goal of national health service (at least for those who have that as their goal). The staying power of Congressman McDermott and the almost 100 congressional single-payer supporters was made possible by labor and the grass- roots movement. There was an understanding of the limitations of a single-payer approach, but they realized its power in deflecting the organized profit group led by the "Jackson Hole" mob. The failure of that profit group to win congressional approval for its program is a real victory. The single-payer strategy proved to be an effective one. But in the upcoming struggle a more advanced strategy will be required. Indeed, the legislative solutions have to be expanded to meet the health care crises that continue to escalate. The CIA Factor Another factor which also must be included in the health debates is the fact that the U.S. government, through its CIA operatives, has been successfully overturning governments throughout the world on the basis that government programs do not work. The privatization taking place in the former socialist countries and in Western Europe are cases in point. These same forces could not allow the U.S. to go in a direction that increases the government's responsibility to take care of its people. Government sources say well over $100 billion would be saved by not having the insurance, drug, profit-making hospital chains, medical supply and equipment companies and finance capital involved. It doesn't matter how logical a government-run program might be, government funded people-serving programs don't fit into the grand scheme of international capital. Because of the drastic results it brings, privatization is now being rejected here in the U.S. and throughout the world. While privatization brings profits to corporations, it leaves a steady stream of death and dying in its path. This is not being lost on those in the line of fire. Remember the AMA A word must be said about the American Medical Association and other segments of organized medicine. Remember when they were the power brokers in national health policy? Now they are relegated to a "pawn in the game" status. When the health industry monopolies say its time to cry about "free choice of physician" and "quality of health care," they hold a press conference. The AMA is caught in a contradiction. Single-payer legislation would maintain the free choice of doctors like in Canada, while the Clinton and Republican plans would put physicians under the control of the insurance carriers and other profiteers. Because the Democratic Party betrayed its campaign promises, the November elections brought more Republicans into office. The Clinton administration has failed to deliver on any substantive campaign promise, especially to labor and community forces. The mass media will report that this more right-of-center Congress will mean death to any health care reform. That need not be the case. On the contrary, the failure of the for-profit industry to win their victory in 1994 will give single-payer advocates energy to continue the struggle. Our side must increase the stakes by broadening the legislative health agenda. After all, the crisis in health care has increased, so the solutions need to be more far reaching. Since immunization and other preventive programs will continue to be cut, infectious diseases will escalate. Pneumonia, measles, sexually transmitted diseases (gonorrhea and syphilis) and AIDs will intensify at a dramatic rate. This is already happening. Infant mortality and longevity rates will worsen. Cancers that are confinable through early detection programs will increase. In each of these instances, the anti-working-class and racist edge will be more apparent than ever before, with racially and nationally oppressed and rural people bearing the brunt of the attack. The sharp distinctions in the two-class system of health care that is growing in the U.S. will further widen. We must get back to putting the health and welfare of people above profits. The popular slogan, "health care is a human right" will lead us in the next period. Its simple message will reach millions of people. That means the funding of public hospitals and community health centers is a top priority. Recruiting people-orientated physicians under strictly observed affirmative action guidelines, to work as salaried doctors to provide medical care is a realizable goal. Public health service physicians have done that in the past and they can, with proper funding, do it in the future. Nurses, social workers and other health care workers need to be recruited into health care in the same manner. The communities who suffer the most must be the venue of this recruitment drive. They are also far more interested in community service and not using their medical degrees to reach mega-buck life styles. The agenda for the next phase of health reform must be expanded to fit the needs of the people's health, not the financial statements of the health monopolies. For example, guaranteeing full prevention services and long-term care is desperately needed. Also, every person in the U.S. must be covered, not just the 85 to 95 percent being talked about. In Canada, they refer to all patients being covered, not citizens. Given the large number of immigrants, with or without papers, the U.S. needs the same approach. Highlighting these elements will increase the value of the already active seniors movement and bring millions of immigrants into the struggle. To defeat the health monopolies will require this kind of mass, people's movement. The single-payer movement is an excellent starting point from which to build a broader movement. Involving organizations like Jobs With Justice is an example of how this movement can be broadened. It is never too late to increase our demands. At the same time, Congress must be pressured to hold the widest possible hearings into the monopolization of the health industry. Congressional hearings must also investigate the massive financial contributions monopoly gave to members of Congress. This legalized extortion must be revealed for its anti-democratic goals. This kind of congressional action can be part of a one-two punch strategy to knockout the monopolies. A big word of caution on moving toward a state-by-state solution. This has been seen as a fallback position by activists. State-plan advocates point to Canada as an example for the U.S. However, Canada has just 7 provinces, not 50 states. There are entirely different histories associated with these national divisions. The current monopolization of the industry precludes a state-based solution, even for tactical reasons. Once states with strong unions take this action, states where labor is weak would never see these benefits. The experience of Medicaid in different parts of the country is a case in point. The monopolies will play one state against the other, just as they do with labor organizing. When the New York Times, on September 30th, devotes a front-page story to the California referendum on single-payer - after the death of the national reform effort - it should give cause to worry about this direction. This does not, however, diminish the value of state and local referenda to dramatize the crisis in health care and the need for national reform. On the contrary, these kinds of local actions make perfect tactical and strategic sense. Any labor negotiator knows that you never end up with what you start out with and if you start out with a basic compromise, the final result will be less. Even if we are to end up with the single-payer compromise, let's increase the stakes now and negotiate from a higher vantage point. The last round showed that by starting out with the single-payer public/private mix, with some profit monopolies in key positions, we almost ended up with a total disaster. Let's not repeat that mistake. Mass actions must be increased so that the sentiments of the people can be heard. Rallies in Washington D.C. and at home will be necessary. Direct actions at the offices of politicians and in the offices of corporate America must be increased. Referendums, petitions and similar mass actions need to be stepped up. The mass-struggle experiences of the last two years will be invaluable as we head toward the next period. A people's health movement, more successful than ever, can emerge from these struggles.

Although trade unionists voted two to one in favor of Democratic candidates, the broken promises of the Clinton presidency insured that the overall voter turnout of working people would be low. The die was cast when President Clinton, in office hardly more than one year, called organized labor a "bunch of strong-armed goons." He pulled out all stops to get the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) passed, and wasn't above slandering the labor movement to do so. This is the same president who refused to lift a finger to get the anti-scab bill (S-55) enacted and who reneged on his promise of national health care. Clinton increasingly came to be seen as pro-monopoly and anti-labor. In the background throughout these struggles was the workers' battle to reform the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act. The abbreviated phrase for this effort became "OSHA reform." Auto Workers Strike Over Speed Up On September 13, 1994, Clinton's Labor Secretary Robert Reich announced the demise of the OSHA reform legislation. At the same time, auto workers were taking matters into their own hands. "The Big 3 (Ford, Chrysler and General Motors) can't make cars and trucks fast enough" was the New York Times headline. While the Ford Motor Company's sales rose 14.5 percent to $3.5 million, autoworkers represented by the United Auto Workers Union fell 10 percent, from 106,600 to 96,000. At the Livonia, Michigan GM engine plant, local union leaders pointed to layoffs as the reason for the increase in health and safety problems. GM is producing more engines today than in 1992, yet the workforce has been reduced from 1,500 to 1,000 workers. After weeks of struggle and a major, week-long strike, GM agreed to rehire 799 workers, admitting that the layoffs were the culprit. The strike was a reaction to the super-exploitation taking place in the auto industry, and it caused extensive production problems for the company. It soon became a painful reality that despite this increasing exploitation, revision of the OSHA law, a supposed Clinton priority, would die a silent death. Job safety and health has not been a priority in either the Clinton or Democratic Party agendas and we will all suffer for it. Reform Needed During the first 20-plus years of the federal OSHA legislation, President Carter's was the only Democratic administration. OSHA head Dr. Eula Bingham was very sympathetic to workers and their unions, which made her very unpopular with the Carter administration. Then-Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall often fought for a strong OSHA law. Marshall did a far better job representing the interests of working people than has Reich. Marshall's positions also made him very unpopular with the Carter administration and Democratic Party bigwigs. Promising in the 1980 election campaign to throw "OSHA into the ocean," the Reagan/Bush team, once elected, pulled every possible administrative trick to kill its effectiveness. Ironically, in 1978-80, before the 12 years of Republican rule began, the Democrats, in 1978-80, led by Senator Edward Kennedy, engineered the first thrust against regulation in general, and OSHA in particular. The 1980 Occupational Safety and Health "Improvement" Act, actually authored by Democratic Party Congressional leaders, attempted to kill OSHA enforcement and other important safety and health rules. Only a broad-based grassroots movement stopped them. During the Reagan/Bush years, the job safety and health movement fought every effort to administratively kill enforcement. Each change was met with stiff resistance. Out of that fightback movement came the effort to reform the law. Many meetings within the labor movement and in coalitions among safety and health activists were held to develop a legislative agenda to make OSHA stronger. The OSHA reform legislation was "drafted" in the period from the 1980s to 1992. The House Labor Committee passed the legislation in 1992. The final legislative proposal, while having many progressive aspects, could have been much stronger if a class struggle approach had been taken by all of labor. It was against this background that leaders of the safety and health, labor, medical/scientific and community movements prepared for the 1992 presidential elections. The Democratic Party platform and Bill Clinton's campaign promises contained the basis for OSHA reform that would significantly improve the safety and health of workers. The election of Bill Clinton also brought a significant Democratic Party margin in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. This increased the hope for the passage of reform. This was supposed to be the "no veto Congress" everyone fought for. Election Hopes Dimmed From the beginning of the Clinton administration, with the appointment of lackluster people like Robert Reich to head the Department of Labor and Donna Shalala to head Health and Human Services (this is where the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is housed), the worrying began. They were appointed over more qualified and aggressive candidates. The impact of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the right-wing of the Democratic Party that controls the Party's strategies and appointments, and the AFL-CIO collaborationist policy began to take hold. When Reich, in September 1994 sent OSHA reform to the grave, he added insult to injury by warning that only if the bill gets "reworked" will it be reconsidered in 1995. In Washington Beltway jargon, that means, make it more acceptable to Big Business. To head up OSHA, the White House and Reich refused highly qualified candidates who were proposed by organized labor. Joe Dear, a state of Washington official and a career administrator, was selected to head OSHA. A similar scenario took place in the appointment of the NIOSH head. Appointing a qualified labor union expert to head OSHA, and a labor recommended medical/scientist to head NIOSH, would have sent the right message to corporate profiteers in reverse of what Reagan/Bush did in 1981 by hiring incompetent corporate people to head the Department of Labor and OSHA. Mass Mobilization Is Key For almost five years the labor movement and its allies mobilized to pressure members of Congress to pass OSHA reform. Local COSH groups (committees on safety and health) showed remarkable effectiveness in pressuring local elected officials. But as the list of sponsors in the House and Senate grew, an eerie silence started to come from the newly-elected officials in the White House, Congress and the Department of Labor. For a number of years, "Worker Memorial Days" (April 28th each year), speeches and related activities were used to agitate for the passage of OSHA reform legislation. These special mobilization days, sponsored by the National AFL-CIO and supported by local grassroots groups, reached into every nook and cranny in the United States. Lobbying took place in Washington, D.C. and at the local offices of legislators. State legislatures and locally elected officials passed supporting resolutions. During the first stages of the Clinton administration, all of the routine legislative activities took place. Union lobbyists met with administration and congressional staffs. Extensive labor/management meetings (in accordance with DLC and AFL-CIO orders) were held to attempt to work out a consensus on key issues. Things seemed to be generally on course. But other events were pointing in a different direction. Clinton was in full gear getting the anti-labor NAFTA bill passed, while the anti-scab bill was in the process of being killed. Health reform was on the road to ruin. Contrary to right-wing allegations that Clinton and congressional leaders were pursuing socialized medicine, they were, in reality, preparing health care for the insurance and drug industries, for-profit hospitals and banking monopolies (see Political Affairs, November, 1994.) The White House legislative agenda was appearing markedly anti-labor. While the White House and Congress were doing their dirty deeds, the Washington D.C. Beltway "permanent government" was being utilized to kill reform. Increasingly well known to unions is the use of Department of Labor lawyers, in its infamous Solicitor's Office, to pick reform legislation apart. Movement activists are familiar with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB was used by those opposed to an effective OSHA to stop progressive regulatory activity in the 1970s and early '80s. In recent times, the Solicitor's Office has become the vehicle to fight against progressive change. It is the one-two punch of the OMB and the Solicitor's Office that has subverted the original intent of Congress. All important OSHA regulatory actions taken against employers must be cleared through the Solicitor's Office, and the first stop for the Solicitor's Office is the Secretary of Labor. If the Secretary of Labor were an independent-minded leader, someone willing to fight the increasingly anti-labor White House, then maybe workers would have gotten an even break. That was the struggle under the Carter administration when Marshall and Bingham often helped labor with its agenda. That is not the case under Clinton. As months dragged on, it became painfully clear that Secretary Reich - who once said that unions should not be necessary - cared little about workers and their unions and a lot more about his career with the Clinton administration. The difference between the labor departments under Carter and Clinton has become increasingly clear, with the understanding that Carter was hardly the standard for a pro-worker administration. Department of Labor lawyers were assigned to working committees dealing with each key aspect of the pending law. They brought with them the political power of the Secretary of Labor, the White House, leaders of the Democratic Party in the House and Senate and their allegiance to big business. The leaders of the Senate and House Committees were usually very supportive of a strong OSHA law, but when they went to their Democratic leaders the message was increasingly clear: tone it down or it won't see the light of day. Active grassroots labor lobbying kept these leaders honest and supportive. But above that level, the struggle was far less effective. The darkness fell like a lead balloon. Corporations Evade Law The key elements of the OSHA reform legislation are its enforcement provisions. From the beginning, employers assigned their attorneys to determine how they could avoid the law or use it as a shield against legal actions by workers and their unions. By the end of OSHA's first 10 years, this shield was used to conceal employers' disregard for safety and health laws. The legal term is pre-emption. The courts ruled that if there is a federal law, then if someone is disabled or killed the employer cannot be indicted by the courts. The only remedy is through inspections. This is similar to how employers use workers' compensation as a legal shield against lawsuits from workers who become disabled or die on the job. By the early part of the 1980s, local district attorneys were being pressured to take worker-killing employers into court. In Chicago, the owners of Film Recovery Inc. were found guilty of killing a worker who they willfully exposed to cyanide. They tried to use the OSHA shield, but the local district attorney successfully indicted and convicted the employer. One company official served some jail time, but the owner of the company fled to Utah and was not brought back to serve time. This case, however, provided an important precedent. In Brooklyn, New York, the owners of Pymm Thermometer Co. were brought into court for seriously endangering their employees. Mercury poisoning was the issue here. At first, the courts ruled this could not be done, since the only remedy was OSHA. Federal pre-emption was, again, the issue. That later changed and the owners of Pymm faced criminal penalties. In Hamlet, North Carolina, at a major poultry factory fire disaster, 25 workers were killed due to locked exits. This was very similar to the New York City Triangle Shirtwaist fire in 1911 where over 150 women garment workers were killed, also due to locked exits. This disaster elevated corporate criminal penalties. It became a centerpiece of OSHA reform. The Department of Labor Solicitor's Office fought hard against this provision and ultimately won. Who Will Run Workplace Committees? An outcome of OSHA legislation could have been the federal requirement that every plant and workplace must have a safety and health committee through which detection, control and prevention of job safety and health hazards take place. This kind of a system, in various forms, is very popular around the world and would have been popular at shops here at home. The former socialist countries had these committees. In Sweden, plant-based safety and health committees are established by law throughout the country. These are labor/management committees. But, in a very advanced form, these committees must be chaired by the labor union at the plant, and there must be at least one more union member than management members. The logic is that without this pro-labor provision, workers and their unions would not have any faith in these committees. At the least, the demand should have been that every worksite have a legally recognized union committee. What was proposed however was a system of labor/management committees of equal numbers and status. Under this kind of system, workers and their unions would surely be at risk if they told the truth. Employer retaliation would be swift against militant representatives on these committees. Sanctions against employers who discriminate against workers who exercise their rights is almost non-existent. The union-only committee would have afforded workers time to conduct private meetings during working hours. No wonder corporate leaders would not like this kind of proposal. This proposed labor/management committee system was supported by workers and their unions, because many did not know that a union-only system was possible. When OSHA reform came under attack, this provision did not ignite much fightback. While it's true a strong local union could win the right to union-run committees, this is rare. Here again, the class collaborationist policies of the Kirkland leadership pushes in the direction of a labor/management system. If that strategy was meant to win legislative support, it totally failed. But along with that failure comes a disarming of workers' ability to fight for a more militant program. One Unified, Strong Law When OSHA was enacted, Congress refused labor's efforts to create one safety and health law protecting all workers. The goal was to correct that "compromise" and eliminate the legal and administrative loopholes that employers use to gain an advantage over workers. Under OSHA reform, the following federal agency safety and health laws were meant to be brought together under a strengthened law. These areas include: Mine Safety and Health Administration (all underground work); Department of Transportation (railroad, trucking, airlines); Department of Energy (all atomic energy sites); Jones Act (high seas); and Federal Workers. The new unified law was not meant to reduce standards, but to use the most stringent rules from each area. Since unions have multiple jurisdictions, a local union committee composed of representatives from each regulatory area would put the union in the driver's seat. It would have prevented employers from trying to hide behind regulation overlap gaps. This provision is especially important for public workers who are excluded from federal OSHA coverage. When OSHA was passed one of the most backward of all congressional compromises was the "states rights" provisions. Under this provision, any state could enact its own OSHA law as long as its program was "as effective as" the federal law. Twenty-four states went this route. All the Southern and Southwestern states took the road of states' rights. Unfortunately, California, Oregon, Washington, and Michigan, states with relatively strong labor movements, also took this route. OSHA had a State Plan Office which was supposed to monitor this program. It has been underfunded from the beginning. Reform did not attempt to eliminate this provision. It merely called for more oversight. This was clearly not enough. By not calling for the elimination of these state plans, valuable local support was lost. The disaster at Hamlet highlighted the state plan debacle. At that non-union site, North Carolina inspectors failed to adequately inspect the plant. Even with this disaster, bringing all states under the federal law was not fully considered. Investigations and committees were established and a lot of militant words came from North Carolina and federal officials. But, ultimately, nothing happened. The hidden government of the U.S. Department of Labor's Solicitor's Office was a target. This office, as much as the infamous Office of Management and Budget, has been responsible for destroying the effectiveness of OSHA. When workers and their unions complain about the failure of OSHA to seek the strongest penalties against employers, the culprit is usually the Solicitor's Office. Its directives come from the pro-corporate offices of the White House and the Democratic Party's political machine. Equity With EPA More often than not, community environmental hazards are created at the factory. Factory workers face occupational-related illnesses and injuries in far stronger doses than do people living in the community. Yet the EPA receives funding well over 10 times that of OSHA. The reverse funding strategy should have taken place. From its inception the EPA was seen as the more important agency. It was given its own government status and is not under any other agency. The same was wanted for OSHA. The lower bureaucratic status radically reduced its funding potential. Over the years, there have been some very successful working relationships between pro-EPA and OSHA activists. Right-wing and corporate ideologues are continually trying to drive wedges between worker and community safety and health activists. But it has been more difficult to divide the two in recent times. For example, the Sierra Club and other environmental organizations gave strong support to anti-NAFTA activities. Combining OSHA and EPA could be a good idea, but only if the best of both laws was used as the common denominator. For example, OSHA has far stronger (at least intended) enforcement powers than EPA. In reality, the difference is probably not a lot, but stronger enforcement powers are needed for both laws. Unfortunately, Congress and the White House have chosen both low funding and weak enforcement powers to kill the real strength of both laws. In the Eula Bingham/Ray Marshall administration, $15 million was distributed each year for labor education and training programs. This program was essential to spawning a nationwide safety and health awareness program. By contrast, Reich has offered a paltry $1.5 million each year. These educational programs were instrumental in bringing safety and health to every corner of the United States. They served as an incentive for the training of safety and health professionals into the field of health and safety. Since most of the funding went to labor unions, it helped unions establish and expand safety and health programs. No wonder corporate power said no to an educational program similar to the Marshall/Bingham period. The Clinton/Reich regime made no effort to increase funding of this important program. An important part of the bill would have established a national rule of protecting workers from repetitive motion and lifting hazards. This field of science has become known as ergonomics. It is estimated that $100 billion in lost work time is due to such injuries. The future of a new standard on ergonomics, given the unwillingness of the Clinton administration to fight corporate lobbying efforts and Congressional Republicans, is rather dim. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.), the new head of the Senate Labor Committee, has rejected this OSHA proposal, saying it is better left to state and local governments. OSHA reform did not improve the federal marshal inspection system. When union representatives raised the issue of hiring more inspectors, they were told it was not possible because there is "too much anti-government feelings." These officials said that labor/management committees and the voluntary compliance that would come through that cooperation would take care of enforcement. This far-fetched idea was not believed. Fear of inspections remains a crucial union strategy to force employer compliance. Therefore, the 1,500 federal inspectors in 26 states is totally inadequate. An even lower level of inspectors exists in the other 24 state plan inspection systems. A reasonable demand would be to immediately put 10,000 federal inspectors into the field to protect workers from the super-exploitation being faced by workers, and 20,000 if all states were covered by federal OSHA. International Health and Safety "One international working class, one struggle against the transnationals" - That is rapidly becoming the workers' demand from every corner of the world. In the Western Hemisphere, the failed struggle against NAFTA with its intent to lower working standards in Mexico, Canada and the United States was a new eye-opener. The cry of internationalism was heard in all three countries. GATT negotiations are bringing the same response - in this case it includes Europe (notably Scandinavia) and Asia. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, with their transnational corporate directors, are licking their profit-chops at the potential of NAFTA, GATT and other trade deals. The collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe has exposed all workers to greater exploitation. The power, at this time, is clearly in the hands of the transnational corporations (TNCs). The disastrous and widely reported increase in child labor exploitation is but one example. But the turnaround is coming. Health and safety activists have long learned that standards and enforcement in the United States are well below other countries. Through the phony cry of tearing down trade barriers, TNCs are seeking the lowest common denominator from all countries. This is an arena of struggle that must be increased. Health Reform That the struggle for health care reform and OSHA reform took place at the same time should have helped both struggles. But some lobbyists and strategists saw them as competing for Congressional action. Many health activists understand that real health reform should start at the workplace. A unified health program is needed for both workers on the job and people living in the communities, regardless of where they work or live. One of the weaknesses of the great health care reform struggles of the 1992-94 period was the lack of inclusion of work-related health delivery issues. The work-relatedness of diseases and injury, and their prevention, must be addressed in the next period of health reform struggle. Over 100,000 workers die each year from work-related illnesses and injuries. Tens of thousands are disabled and rely on health services either through their workers' compensation insurance or the regular system of employer paid group insurance. Since it is practically impossible for workers to win compensation claims for work-related illnesses, they must rely on the health system everyone else is saddled with for treatment of illnesses. This will bring tens of thousands of workers and their families into the struggle for real health care reform. Workers and their unions can give valuable examples of their experiences with workers' compensation carriers as an example of how all insurance carriers treat people. They will also be able to describe the evils of state plans to gain benefits since the decrepit workers' compensation system is entirely state-based. This combined struggle would have united the health care and the OSHA reform struggles. The enemies of both pieces of legislation were certainly working together. The disastrous experience with OSHA state plans, workers' compensation and state-based Medicaid and Medicare, even in their quasi-federal form, must be not repeated with single payer state plans. The Republican-controlled Congress will reject federal action in favor of state solutions. Class collaboration in the trade union movement must be overcome. The road to full achievement of worker and labor rights does not go through the dead-end of labor/management cooperative schemes. Business unionism that relies on collaborating with employers is a McCarthyite holdover that has not been successful in winning any victories for workers or their unions. The failure of the Clinton administration to support any of the key labor issues in its first two years shows the bankruptcy of the labor/management strategy. Safety and health activists can help to lead workers and their unions out of this dead-end approach. Keeping the pressure on Congress and the White House must continue. But that pressure must switch from top-level individual lobbying efforts to mass struggle tactics. The labor movement and its community allies can not match the financial contributions to politicians from the corporations. Corporate power and money can only be balanced through the mobilization of large numbers of people. The lobbying of politicians in state capitols and in the halls of Congress also means that grassroots tactics and strategies are needed. Such grassroots struggles could include: workplace actions around safety and health; building local committees; forming and joining with broad-based coalitions for social change; building Worker's Memorial Day activities; public demonstrations at corporate offices; national demonstrations in Washington; joining the struggles for national health care with the fight for strict OSHA enforcement; and building national and international working-class unity that will put an end to the destructive policies of GATT and NAFTA. With the Republicans controlling the Senate and the House of Representatives, and with the White House moving even more to the right, the importance of mass action has grown. Political pundits predict a further demise of labor unions and the end of progressive positions on social and economic issues. But history shows that when the working class is mobilized its power can overcome politicians and their corporate backers. With the conditions of workers' safety and health growing worse every day, the willingness to join in fightback activities will increase dramatically. Now is the time to unleash the power of workers through independent political action, sparked by grassroots worksite actions on issues of health and safety.

That was the reply given recently by a nurse and her doctor supervisor at the other end of a long distance number at one of the major insurance carriers in the country to my request that my patient be authorized for a fourth post-op day in the hospital after major surgery. Without such a sanction, the insurance company would deny payment to the hospital. This so-called "carve out" is aptly labeled. Hospitals are quickly learning not to bite the hand that feeds them. Sides are being drawn - on one are the patient and the doctor; on the other are the third party carriers and their extensions, the hospitals. This scenario is becoming commonplace in the daily workings of America's physicians and their insurance company bosses. For assured payments, the physician must now request permission for treatment of either a medical or surgical nature. Indeed, any form of hospitalization short of a life-threatening emergency must first be cleared through the carrier's offices. How has this come about in these past few years? The answer is in the euphemism for a health care program for America. It is called managed care or competition, as engineered by the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and/or the Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), two forms of groups of physicians and their ancillary health care professionals.This is all very much a part of the equation we are coming to know as the Contract With America. All of the nation's physicians recently received a mailing from the various states' departments of Social Service. This is the same Medicaid that took several hits along the way during the Reagan and Bush administrations and is now heading for even greater dismemberment. What is the real message and intent of these newly contrived programs? That corporate America is finding ways to outsmart and outmaneuver the American medical community and the American people in trying to convince us that something is being done to improve our health care delivery. The U.S. remains the world's only developed country without a comprehensive health care package for its citizens. The insurance industry, the only one along with organized baseball that is exempt from antitrust regulations, is continually seeking new ways and means and tricks to keep it that way. Thus, managed care, with a corporate mother and a congressional father, is being applied in the spirit of privatization of Medicaid and even Medicare. Indeed, Medicare has gone through changes this past decade that allowed for third-party carriers such as Blue Cross to supervise and disperse funds from the Medicare pool, all, of course, after skimming the pot as a commission. That all of these systems sop up an almost one-third in administrative expenses as compared to, for example, the ten percent in Canada, is no surprise. Once the insurance cabal got its proverbial feet in the door, it went for the whole picture, and it now dictates the lengths of hospital stay, the procedures allowed, and even the after discharge care. The penalty for disobedience or even resistance is severe. Carve outs are liberally applied, and after the hospitals are denied their reimbursements, the patients are left with the burden of payment. Many have been pestered by collection agencies. Some of these standards for lengths of stay and procedural codes that are used for billing purposes are based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) formula created for Medicare and adopted by most if not all of the insurance providers or on formulas of the carrier's own making. The goal is the same - to reduce the number of patient-hospital days to the barest minimum. The status of the patient has little to do with it. The physicians' fees are not affected in any direct way; they remain the same no matter the extent of the care offered the patient because they are preset by the code. Happily, the doctor can remain altruistic with regard to patient care. However, there are subtle penalties meted out for physicians who do not keep the short stay goals of the carrier in mind. The insurance people are in an all out competition war. Medical services are being peddled like just another commodity. CEOs and heads of operations at the nation's multinationals are being wined and dined as a part of the hard sell. U.S. Healthcare, the Blues (Blue Cross/Blue Shield), Aetna and the others have hired high powered Madison Avenue agencies to hawk their wares to both the corporate buyer and the media listener and consumer. Many are using celebrities as a part of the glitz of this ad campaign. Merger Craze More, in this now hectic atmosphere that is being created by Wall Street's merger craze, medicine as an industry is not escaping the rush. Just as Chemical and Chase are seeking to control more of the banking business business-driven conglomerates are reaching out with their tentacles that are engulfing medical PPOs and hospitals. This type of consolidation alone would reshape the entire health care picture in America, putting more and more of the emphasis on profit, business, and net worth. In New York State, with the nation's largest Medicaid enrollment, it is no wonder that newly elected governor George Pataki, is already busy clearing the way for Medicaid to come under the control of a managed care unit. This is a part of his often announced plans for a privatization blueprint in general, which includes many other public services. That mass mailing to doctors indicated that in certain areas in the state, such managed care is now mandatory. It is anyone's guess as to how soon the whole program will convert to such a status. Has the buying public benefited in any way? Are the doctors providing better care for their patients? Are hospital services more sensitive to patient needs? Are there any rewards for the buying public in the forms of reduced premiums or deductibles? The answer to all four is No! The hospitals are under the gun, as already noted, to obey the rules of the DRGs, and the timed discharges and their rewards, in the form of no carve-outs, are given only if the patients are discharged as quickly as possible. This past month, in a move that should have been embarrassing to the provider insurance company, Governor Christie Whitman of New Jersey used an executive order to allow post-cesarean women to stay three days instead of two in the hospital; other states are taking notice. Doctors are seeing more and more patients in the same time frames with the obvious less astute care that comes with a fast take. Moreover, if anything, patient insurance premiums have risen. The funds have simply shifted from physicians and hospitals and other health providers to the insurance company coffers. Medicaid's credibility is owed to the fact that it is the only plan available to the poor. But that is where it stops. Vast improvements are needed in the forms of more funding and more comprehensive services for all. The solution is within internal improvement and not in a sellout to private carriers. By the same token, physician control is also lacking. A plan to demystify, deglorify, and deprofessionalize the medical community is long overdue. The logical overseer would be a civilian review board. Apparently, more and more states are encouraging their Medicaid participants to enroll in their strictly-for-profit HMOs, and this is happening all over. Florida is the first state to have started such a program and they are well under way. There followed the expected windfall of Medicaid monies into the HMOs. The subterfuge used is the claim that Medicare and Medicaid are not being gutted but "saved." The report that Medicare will be "broke" by the year 2002 is a trick at its best. As with Social Security, monies are being siphoned off from Medicare by every administration in a Peter-to-pay Paul arrangement. Peter is the entitlements that are for the people; Paul becomes the military complex and the Pentagon. Another euphemism for fund cutting of the Medicaid program is the block grant. This is the plot out of the early Reagan years when monies for Medicaid were allocated in a lump sum, always bearing the boast that it is "more than enough." When the earmarked reserves are met, patients are denied medical care, either through a raise in the eligibility criteria or by just closing the doors of the health station or clinic. It is as simple as that. And as cruel. The proverbial worm seems to have turned. The American medical community is awakening to its role on the side of the patient and opposed to the insurance industry and the health care conglomerate. It is regrettable that physician organizations are not oriented toward that thinking, although they may be in the future. The buying public has long been victimized by a system that placed them second to profit. It should welcome the doctors as a part of that equation. Until America joins the ranks of the other industrialized nations and provides its people with their rights to total health care, Medicare and Medicaid will have to suffice. Vigilance will be needed to protect what we have already fought for and won.

Moreover, it is the more destructive drive to maximize profit by huge multinational corporations in contrast to the petty capitalist entrepreneur physician of decades ago. Fee-for-service medicine, where the physician receives a fee for each medical procedure, has predominated in the delivery of medicine in the United States for about 150 years. Until the 1940s, however, entrepreneurial "cottage craft" physicians ran a fairly low-budget business. As a result, the fees charged remained relatively low. Spurred by technological advancements resulting from World War II, high-tech medicine experienced explosive growth from that period until the present day. As a result of this extraordinary change in the field of medicine, the techniques of medical care have been radically altered, and just as importantly the social organization of medicine has been fundamentally changed. Medical specialties proliferated alongside the burgeoning medical technology industry. The family practice physician and surgeon of the last century proliferated into dozens of specialties. The practice of modern medicine has become defined by its expanding technology, and by those with the capital to purchase that technology and to purchase the services of those who can operate it. The solo fee-for-service physician of decades ago is being forced into group practice in order to afford to practice, and in order to maximize the profits of practice. Many physicians were forced into mutually dependent relationships with hospitals. Hospitals had the capital with which to purchase the products of the medical technology industry, and physicians had the expertise to utilize the technology and the ability to steer patients to it. From its humble condition in the last century, medicine suddenly became a powerful trillion-dollar engine in the American capitalist economy. The manufacturers of medical technology and pharmaceuticals became huge multinational corporations, cashing in on inventions and discoveries often supported significantly by government and paid for by tax dollars. These industries pushed their products, frequently unsafe or ineffective, into every nook and cranny of hospitals and clinics - creating "profit centers" where there had been closets, staff rooms, even vacant lots. Hospitals sprouted up across the country, propelled by an ever increasing proportion of for-profit, investor-owned enterprises. In the mad rush for the profits of corporate control, big regional chains of hospitals were acquired by huge multi-billion dollar multinational chains. Even the public sector was sacked as county hospitals were purchased by the chains or contracted out to for-profit management companies. Physician salaries increased as they charged more and more, fueled by the utter lack of accountability. Physicians could double and triple their income by "self referring," i.e., becoming investors in laboratories and diagnostic imaging facilities (such as x-rays and CAT scans) and then referring their own patients to these enterprises. The health insurance industry didn't really care, since their profits exploded in direct relationship to the rising costs of health insuhttp://www.cubaweb.cu/an inconsequential presence in 1940 to a dominant financial industry in the United States currently worth hundreds of billions of dollars. More Medicine, More profit The key mantra in this history has been "more medicine is more profit." Hospitals did everything they could to attract more physicians in order to capture their patients - every bed a potential profit center. Physicians over-treated patients for the same reason - every patient encounter added to the bottom line. Despite the occasional appearance of protest, the insurance industry had no reason to change the situation because they were wallowing in ever-increasing profits. The fact that tens of millions of Americans had been priced out of this medical profits machine did not matter to the health care industry and was not enough to change the system. Rather, two emerging processes have coalesced in recent years resulting in the managed care onslaught. First, the hundreds of billions of health care dollars have been concentrated in the hands of a few huge health insurance companies, a few giant hospital chains, and a few mammoth managed care organizations. Physicians have not competed well against the multinational corporations and have lost financial and political control to them. Secondly, the Fortune 500 industries have grown tired of transferring their potential profits to health insurers and providers. They want cheaper health care with more stable costs year after year. Rise of Health Maintenance Organizations The old health care industry lines blurred as the biggest health insurance companies went on a binge purchasing health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and hospital chains started their own. HMOs are a form of managed care where members pay a fixed fee to a corporation that controls which health care providers its members will have access to. Some of the earlier HMOs such as Kaiser, Health Insurance Plan of New York, and Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, were established as cooperatives or non-profits and focused on service rather than profit. However, most newer HMOs are investor-owned strictly for-profit enterprises. These profit-seeking HMOs gobble up the health care resources in a region, then offer a packaged deal to industry and government. This has turned on its head the old mantra, "more medicine is more profit." Since HMOs are paid a fixed sum to provide for the medical needs of a specific population, the new HMO industry mantra is "less medicine is more profit." Far from being merely a theoretical issue, mounting evidence indicates that the quality of health care is plummeting under the greedy control of for-profit HMOs. This is of particular concern since in 1992 about 550 HMOs controlled the health of over 41 million Americans, and the growth of HMO coverage remains explosive. In the early 1970s, California contracted with over 50 HMOs to provide care for 300,000 Medicaid enrollees. In just a few years the entire program was awash in a quality of care scandal and was abandoned. In the early and mid-1980s, Arizona and Ohio had similar devastating experiences. (1) During the past five years Florida has repeated the experiments with HMOs for over a third of a million residents. A major state newspaper characterized the outcome as "a separate and dangerously unequal care system." In addition, evaluators found that some HMOs spend as little as half their revenues for medical care, and most of the HMOs were given overall evaluations of "poor" or "very poor." (2) Last year the Center for the Study of Services tried to gather member-satisfaction ratings for 250 health plans and by federal employees. Sixty of the plans refused to let their members respond to the questionnaires. (3) In 1992 fewer than 100 HMOs covered 1.6 million people on Medicare. Today, 165 HMOs are responsible for the health care of 2.5 million Medicare recipients, and another 70 HMOs are waiting in the wings to make their killing in the marketplace. The states, eager to reduce their financial burden, are abandoning their Medicaid patients to for-profit HMOs with little or no significant evaluation. Mounting evidence indicates widespread fraudulent and deceptive marketing practices, paralleling the long history of similar abuses in long-term care and Medigap insurance sales to the elderly. (4) Recently, a few dozen corporate bigwigs, representatives of government and members of other assorted organizations representing 80 million workers and their families, met in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. (5) These are hardcore HMO advocates but they realize their cut-rate health care vision is in trouble. They have pledged to change their focus from reducing costs to increasing quality of managed health care. They are running scared because they know the results of emerging research and the people's experiences. They want to save managed care in order to secure their profits. Quality of care in HMOs and other managed care health plans is the Achilles heel of the scheme. There is a tremendous amount of energy among community groups, public health professionals, the elderly and grassroots health reformers and advocates. This energy must be focused, first, to hone in on the quality of care issue under managed care. Questionnaires can be handed out to members of these plans, and hearings can be held. Inquiries can be made for information at state agencies, and if they don't have quality of care information or will not release it, then that in itself becomes part of the problem that must be publicized. Collect information from the library - there is more coming out every week. The energy of the people must be focused secondly on eliminating all profits from health care. It is simply too late for the popular single payer option that they have in Canada. As Physicians for a National Health Program (historically advocates for single payer) are now asking, "What would public financing of a system, dominated by large for-profit horizontally and vertically integrated firms and chains look like, and mean?" (6) The only answer for the working people of the United States is a publicly financed and operated, democratically run National Health Service which eliminates all profit in health care. Legislation advocating a National Health Service was introduced once again by Representative Ron Dellums (D-CA) as HR 1798, on June 8, 1995 (104th Cong., 1st Sess.) The struggle must start with a crushing attack on the quality of care under for-profit managed care. This must be led by the labor movement and its allies in the community and professional ranks. The breadth of the struggle must include the saving and expanding of Medicare and Medicaid; immediate coverage of all uninsured people that single payer legislation will bring; major public housing programs; full-scale environmental and occupational health prevention programs - all culminating around the fight for a national health service. These are the short and long-term goals that our movement needs and the politicians must respond to! Reference Notes Alvin L.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. The following is the full text of a letter which appeared, abridged, in the Wednesday, Dec. 18 New York Times. It is a response to a vicious, FBI-like anti-Communist op-ed on Dec. 10 which slandered the Communist Party's 77-year history of fighting for civil rights. J. Edgar Hoover must be smiling from his grave. W.E.B. Du Bois must be turning in his. Hoover, because the stench of the McCarthyism he helped create continues to foul the op-ed page of the New York Times. Du Bois, because opportunists continue to abuse the name and legacy of the organization he helped found. Denton L. Watson's article on Thurgood Marshall is straight out of Hoover's McCarthyite Cold War propaganda machine - straight out of the gutter. The Communist Party "embarrassed" the NAACP during the Scottsboro case; organized African Americans as a "fifth column;" "used women" to seduce unsuspecting Blacks; Communists, not racists, were the "greatest threat" to the NAACP? Echoes of McCarthy? This is demagogy that rivals, if not exceeds, the Big Lie of McCarthyism during the 1950s. That it appears in the New York Times in 1996 gives reason for pause. One need not respond to the garbage, but to set the record straight: Socialism and Communism are not foreign imports but are home-grown American products. The lives and political legacies of figures like W.E.B. Du Bois and Mary Wright Ovington - both life-long advocates of socialism and founders of the NAACP - amply testify to this. During the 77 years of the CPUSA, Communists worked side by side with many organizations in trade unions and civil rights organizations and, yes, with the NAACP for jobs, peace, against racism and for social equality. That white people and African Americans - including Du Bois - joined the Communist Party was no crime. Nor was it the result of some hidden plot. Rather, people joined the Party because of their admiration of its work against racism and for the rights of workers, Black, Brown and white. Du Bois himself dismissed the conspiracy charge. "I reject the charge that Communism is a conspiracy," he said when joining the Communist Party. It was the rabid anti-Communist hysteria of McCarthyism, falsely charging the Communist movement with conspiracies and plots, that led to the Smith Act trials for conspiring to "think" and "teach" - charges that many of us went to jail for. We wonder at the publication of such patently false allegations today. We remember that Big Lie anti-Communism has always been the foundation of fascist-like thinking. Let all democratic-minded people be warned: this demagogy, if left unanswered, threatens democracy itself - it is the stuff of fascism. We close with the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., spoken when memorializing Dr. Du Bois in 1968 just weeks before King's assassination. Observing that Du Bois was a genius who chose to be a Communist, he said, "Irrational, obsessive anti-Communism has led us into too many quagmires to be retained as if it were a mode of scientific thinking."

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. NEW YORK - Advance copies of the 21st edition of theUrban League's The State of Black America were made available to the press on Nov. 22. In nine essays discussing the questions of unemployment and underemployment; infant mortality and life expectancy; income, housing and health, the report documents its conclusion that the fundamental question facing Black America - and millions of other Americans - is poverty. The League has always recognized the centrality of poverty as the determining factor in its report and has issued many calls for increased job opportunities. But this year there is something different: In words that leave no room for misunderstanding, Hugh Price, the League's president, calls for an urban policy centered on a modern-day Works Progress Administration (WPA) to end the "Great Depression in America's ghettos. There is nothing un-American about spending money to help fill gaping holes in the labor market," he writes. And there are gaping holes: * Even the understated "official" figures show an unemployment rate in the African American community double that among non-Hispanic white workers - and that has remained at or above 10 percent since the mid-1970s. * More than 40 percent of African American households in metropolitan areas are trapped in what the Census Department calls "high poverty neighborhoods." * One out of every three African Americans live in poverty, a rate three times that of whites. Although African Americans constitute only 15 percent of the total population, they constitute 40 percent of those living in poverty. * In 1984 African American men working full-time year-round had incomes averaging less than 75 percent of non-Hispanic white men while the average annual earnings of African American women fell 15 percent below that of non-Hispanic white women. * African American high school graduates earn about 82 percent of what white graduates earn and the gap widens as the level of education increases: While Black male high school graduates earn $1,490 per year more than a white high school drop-outs, African American males with college degrees earn only $7,000 per year more than white high school graduates. Dr. June Jackson Christmas, the Urban League's Urban Issues Group director, says that African Americans will not reach the goals set in Healthy People 2000, a government report that sets forth a national strategy to improve the nation's health, because of major disparities that continue to exist between their health status and that of white Americans. "African Americans still endure significant health problems which are caused and exacerbated by poverty, lack of culturally competent health-care providers, ineffective health care and racial discrimination," Christmas writes. She adds that improvements in these areas are not enough to guarantee better health among African Americans. "The problems that afflict African Americans as a group begin, literally, before birth for far too many infants and continue to the end of life." * In 1993, life expectancy for African Americans was 69.3 years compared to 76.3 years for white Americans and more than 75 years for the population as a whole. The disparity is even more glaring for African American men whose life expectancy is more than eight years less than white men. While life expectancy for whites increased during the 1980s, it declined for African Americans. * At 16.8 deaths per 100,000 births, African Americans have the highest infant mortality rates of all ethnic groups and nearly three times the mortality rate of white infants. * If African Americans were considered a separate population group in the world, their infant mortality rate would rank number 40. * A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found infant mortality rates to be 60 percent higher for women living below the poverty line than for those living above it. * Among the leading causes of infant mortality are disorders due to short gestation and low birth weight, both associated with poverty sand malnutrition. Christmas says the HMO drive to cut the cost of health care and a "mood of conservatism" among policy makers makes it harder for African Americans to achieve Year 2000 targets: The change from public responsibility to corporate privatization, mergers and "megasystem networks," block grant to states, a diminished role for the federal government and "a level of government historically inattentive to Black Americans" will deal heavy blows to the poor and especially to African Americans. "Further," she says, "the policy of cutting back on the number of medical graduates and decreasing the ratio of specialists to primary care doctors does not address the gross under-representation of [African Americans] as both specialists and primary care physicians." Timothy Bass, professor of labor and urban affairs at Wayne State University, criticizes the job-creation strategies of cities that, he says, are a two-edged sword: While development of central business districts creates more white-collar jobs, they will, if successful, create many low-wage service jobs, thus contributing to the proliferation of low-wage work. Bass says such policies are "a cause of, not a cure for" low wages. He charges that maintaining the poverty inherent in low-wage industry is an important component of city development strategies. "It is the practices adopted by employers, not trends in worker productivity, which is increasingly responsible for rising poverty that is rooted in declining compensation and job security." In closing, Bass says the "challenges to this emerging status quo, if they are forthcoming, will arise when younger generations put forth a class-based agenda to reverse the decline of the institutionalized power of labor." While not written in the language of working people, the message of The State of Black America 1996 came through clearly: The fight for equality - and therefore, to close the "gaping holes" that are documented in the report - must go hand-in-hand with any struggle aimed at resolving the problems facing working people. And the fact that trade union and African American votes were two of the most important components of the coalition that denied Bob Dole the keys to the White House shows that it can be done. **'We need a modern-day WPA'** We believe the urban policy must have a laser-like focus on jobs for the inner-city poor. No fancy master plans. No complex policies with dozens of components. We need public policies which make work economically worthwhile ... We've been content for too long with a low-wage economy that locks hard-working Americans into poverty. Boosting the minimum wage helps a bit, as does protecting the Earned Income Tax Credit from continuous assault by Congress. Make no mistake. Inner city folk want to work. We've got to spread the job action around if inner city folk are to work - and if cities are to work. There is no macro-economic policy, no economic growth scenario, no Model Cities approach, no black capitalism strategy and no enterprise zone experiment imaginable that can match the Depression-era Works Progress Administration in jumpstarting hope by driving unemployment down in a hurry ...

NEW HAVEN, Conn. - The holiday season began in earnest recently with the Dec. 6 arrest of a Santa-suited union organizer in New York, followed with the Dec. 10 arrest of AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney here. Sweeney was arrested at a solidarity march and rally in support of the Federation of Union Employees at Yale University. He was also arrested earlier this year while supporting Detroit newspaper workers on strike against that city's daily papers. 'Santa,' in actuality UNITE organizer Kurt Edelman, was arrested while participating in a demonstration protesting the sale of garments produced by sweatshop labor at Lord & Taylor, an up-scale Manhattan clothing store. "We are here to send a message from one of our nation's poorest communities to one of its richest institutions that we may be poor but we have a secret power," Sweeney told the more than 1,500 cheering demonstrators, "and we are going to use that power to keep Yale a civilized institution." Yale, with a $4.8 billion endowment is the largest employer in New Haven, a city where the per capita income is less than $13,000. Sweeney said the battle of 3,700 technical, service and maintenance workers at Yale was part of a nationwide campaign to bring greedy employers "from New Haven to New Mexico" to justice. Sweeney then led several hundred demonstrators into the street. When the group ignored a police order to disperse, Sweeney, together with more than 300 others, was escorted to waiting police vehicles as Rosa Dasher, a member of Local 35, joined guitarist Tom Juravich in a spirited rendition of "You'll Never Walk Alone." Even the police smiled as a voice from the crowd said, "Don't let them take you alive!" as the arrests began. In an interview before the demonstration began, Sweeney told the World that civil disobedience is "part of the labor movement's arsenal. It is certainly a way of showing solidarity," he said. "It worked for the civil rights movement and there is no reason why it can't work for the labor movement." Sweeney said he would give Labor '96, the AFL-CIO's electoral campaign, a "grade of 9.9 out of 10" and that he "had no regrets whatsoever" for his decision to run for the presidency of the 13-million-member labor federation last year. The Dec. 10 demonstration was the latest in the year-long struggle by members of Locals 34 and 35 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees who have been working without a contract since February. The main issue is the demand of the university that it have the unilateral right to contract out much of the work done by dining hall and maintenance workers. Al, a plumber who declined to give his last name, has worked at Yale for 17 years. "I went to Yale right after graduating from high school - but not as a student," he said jokingly. Al sees the fight at Yale as a fight for the future of all working families. "We just have to take a stand," he said. Last month the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) charged Yale with illegal retaliation against union members following two four-week strikes last spring. The illegal acts included the discharge of a part-time worker for supporting the strike, prohibiting certain employees from discussing the union, the involuntary transfer of a union steward to what amounts to solitary confinement, and refusing to honor contract language regarding payroll deduction of union dues. In his speech Sweeney reminded university officials that the NLRB had found Yale guilty of violating federal labor laws. "Those are serious crimes," he said. "If members of the Yale Corporation board were members of the president's cabinet they would be forced to resign." The Rev. Lillian Daniel told demonstrators that a Ph.D. from Yale is not needed to understand what constitutes a just contract. Then, in remarks directed at non-residents, she said she hoped that people would not take Yale's illegal union-busting activity to mean that New Haven is a "high crime city." Rev. Boise Kimber, a leader of New Haven's African American clergy, called the struggle at Yale "a fight for the rights this country was founded on. It's a wrestling match against intolerance and wickedness in high places. It's a fight against a bottom line that keeps its workers at the bottom. I challenge Yale's board of directors and President Richard Levin to reexamine their values." Levin will be paid $350,000 in 1996, double his 1995 salary. Among those arrested with Sweeney were Laura Smith, president of Local 34; Bob Proto, president of Local 35; Miles Rappaport, Connecticut secretary of state; John Olson, president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO; Joelle Fishman, chair of the Communist Party of Connecticut; and Blair Bertaccini, president of the Waterbury Central Labor Council. Those arrested face fines of $80. NLRB's Yale ruling sets precedent A recent NLRB charge against Yale has national importance. For many years, graduate teaching assistants at Yale have been trying to organize a union, the Graduate Employees and Students Organization (GESO). Yale has refused to recognize the union, claiming that grad students who work as teaching assistants are students rather than workers employed by the university. A year ago it seemed possible that GESO could join with the other Yale employees in joint action to win contracts for all. As part of that effort, GESO called a grade strike last December and its members refused to turn in grades for the courses they teach. Yale moved quickly to crush GESO, firing its members from their teaching positions, instituting academic disciplinary proceedings and blacklisting GESO activists. In the face of this, the strike was called off. In its charge, the NLRB ruled that GESO members are employees covered by federal labor law, that they were engaged in a legal strike and that Yale acted illegally in taking retribution against its leaders and members. This ruling will give a boost to the growing unionization of graduate student teachers around the country, and to all the unions fighting for contracts at Yale. - Fred Gaboury Read the Peoples Weekly World Sub info: pww@igc.apc.org 235 W. 23rd St. NYC 10011 $20/yr - $1-2 mos trial sub Return to the top or to the People's Weekly World home page.

Cleveland - The election of Dennis Kucinich in Ohio's10th Congressional District was a ground-breaking event demonstrating the powerful political potential of a mass, grassroots coalition led by labor. Trade unionists and seniors provided the largest numbers of some 5,000 volunteers but many others came from Hispanic, environmental, peace and other organizations. Some were unemployed workers or shoppers at the outdoor mall where the headquarters was located who just walked in and offered to help. On any day after early September there were probably 100 people working for some period of time in the headquarters, a beehive of activity and camaraderie, where anyone could find plenty of baked goods, bagels and cream cheese and other snacks brought in by the volunteers. According to the campaign staff, the volunteers canvassed at least 600 of the district's 750 precincts, some as many as four times. They turned the western half of Cuyahoga County and especially the west side of Cleveland into a sea of 15,000 bright yellow yard signs reading "Light Up Congress! Elect Dennis Kucinich" - a reminder of the historic fight Kucinich had waged as Cleveland mayor when he refused to sell the city-owned power plant to a private electric company. The staff estimated that the volunteers made 100,000 phone calls and mailed out one million pieces of literature. Many organizations issued their own literature and did their own mailings including the AFL-CIO's Labor '96, the UAW CAP Council, the Sierra Club, Peace Voter '96, gay rights and senior groups. The United Auto Workers and the Steelworkers did plantgate distributions. The Ohio Council of Senior Citizens distributed 12,000 pieces with the positions of Kucinich and his opponent, incumbent Martin Hoke, on senior issues to senior buildings, nutrition sites and bingo games. This was after the National Council of Senior Citizens and the Cleveland AFL-CIO Retiree Council mailed voter registration and absentee ballot forms to 16,000 union retirees. The coalition embraced many political viewpoints: Democrats, independents, Greens, socialists, Communists, members of the Labor Party, even some disgruntled Republicans. Democratic Party figures, including First Lady Hillary Clinton, Congressmen Louis Stokes, Joseph Kennedy and Barney Franks visited Cleveland to help in the effort. Especially significant were visits by Congresspersons Luis Gutierrez and Nydia Velazquez who spoke to large meetings and rallies and on the radio mobilizing an unprecedented vote in the Hispanic community. But it was the grassroots, labor-community coalition that Kucinich had in mind on election night when he gave his impassioned victory speech with jubilant leaders of organized labor standing behind him, their right fists held high, chanting, "We are the party of the people! We are the party of the people!" The coalition was inspired by both Kucinich's personality and his program. Respected as a champion of the underdog and working people, Kucinich was the son of a truck driver, who grew up in extreme poverty even living for a time out of the family car. As mayor, he had battled the power structure, the utilities, the banks, the mass media and, although his efforts saved the city light plant, he had waged the fight alone with no organized base and was ruthlessly crushed after the banks retaliated, forcing the city into default. Despite years of ostracism and ridicule in the media, Kucinich staged a dramatic comeback in 1994, when he was elected to the state senate, one of the only Democrats in the country to unseat an incumbent Republican in the year of the Gingrich "revolution." At a time when other candidates of his party believed they should move to the right and fell like flies, Kucinich declared himself to be a Roosevelt Democrat and championed the views of an emerging left-center, labor-community coalition. In the state legislature he spoke out on behalf of this growing coalition, leading fights against privatization, the locating of a nuclear waste dump in Ohio, and the cutting of badly needed services to seniors and Hispanics. With the AFL-CIO mobilizing to defeat the Gingrich gang in Congress, it was only natural that Kucinich's campaign would become a national rallying point. Unlike many other Democrats whom labor supported as "lesser evils," Kucinich raised the stakes. He issued a bill of rights for working people stating his belief that people have a right to a job, a right to a safe workplace, to decent wages and benefits, to strike, to participate freely in the political process. Issued on glossy paper with a bright yellow background, the program was distributed throughout the labor movement and posted on union bulletin boards everywhere. The Republicans reacted with fury to this open challenge to their decades of labor-baiting bully tactics. Kucinich's program, Republican county chairman Jim Trakas announced, is "very similar to the Communist Manifesto" and is "what Lenin stood for." Kucinich blasted this reversion to "McCarthyism." Martin Hoke, a loutish multi-millionaire, had been lucky to face seriously wounded opponents in his two previous races. He had unseated Mary Rose Oakar in 1992 when the longtime Congresswoman was embroiled in the House banking and post office "scandals." In 1994 he faced County Treasurer Francis Gaul, the focus of blame for the collapse of a key bond fund. Hoke, as Kucinich was fond of saying, was a man who woke up one day on third base and thought he had hit a triple. After the 1994 elections, Hoke jumped on the Gingrich bandwagon with a vengeance, championing the Contract on America, denouncing labor, federal social programs and efforts to raise the minimum wage while skipping important votes for photo opportunities with the House Speaker. At first Hoke adopted an upbeat, positive posture, with TV ads showing him fraternizing with workers and playing the piano for senior citizens. But as an AFL-CIO television campaign exposed his ultra-right voting record and positions, he found himself trailing by eight to ten points. The mask was then removed and the phony smile replaced with the snarl of labor-baiting and character assassination. Voicing his class hatred, Hoke assailed "Washington labor bosses" who, he said, were "stealing their members' dues" to "run a campaign of lies and smears" against him. In fact, It was Hoke's campaign that degenerated into lies and smears as he saturated TV with ads slandering Kucinich's role as mayor and wildly charging that his health care proposals would bankrupt the country. When Rep. Barney Frank appeared for a Kucinich fundraiser, Hoke falsely charged that Kucinich advocated homosexual marriage and scurrilous, unsigned leaflets were distributed at churches, charging that Kucinich's supporters favored sex with children and animals. The smears were endlessly propagated by a right-wing talk show host who made it his mission three hours every morning to stop Kucinich. The poisonous attacks, aimed at suppressing voter turnout, caused the race to tighten considerably. In the final week before the election the focus of the Hoke campaign shifted to virulent red-baiting directed at this writer. In what was probably a first since the beginning of the Cold War, Kucinich refused to knuckle under, calmly stating that I was one of 5,000 volunteers and declaring, "It's Halloween and Hoke is dressing up as Joe McCarthy. Karl Marx is not running my campaign but apparently Harpo Marx is running his." On Nov. 5 Hoke was defeated by a vote of 108,000 to 102,000 with 10,000 going to a candidate of the Natural Law Party. It was a stunning rebuke to Hoke's shameful attempt to whip up hatred and hysteria. Although he spent a million dollars - over twice as much as Kucinich - he could not shake the solid majority of voters who showed outstanding maturity. Unable to accept defeat gracefully, he never actually conceded and the next day denounced what he claimed was a "war that John Sweeney and the AFL-CIO declared on the people of America." The "war," he whined, will continue because the Republicans, although seriously weakened, retain control of Congress. While the war was hardly declared by labor, it is certain that labor and its allies will continue their efforts to reverse the nearly two decades of assault on unions and all that is decent in this country, and they will be able to count on the staunch, heart-felt support of Congressman Dennis Kucinich.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. The 1996 election set the pace for the next steps in the struggle to meet the people's needs. Despite the record low turnout, the corporate-financed campaign of the ultra-right Republicans, the use of deceptive dirty tactics, the struggle to defeat the ultra right danger has had a big impact. The fascist threat which emerged in the course of the 104th Congress, and especially at the GOP convention, has been checked for now. as the ultra-right fell short of many of their goals. Although Labor and the people's forces accepted the "lesser of two evils" tactic, it is now time to challenge the "lesser evil": the Clinton administration and the weaknesses of the Democratic Party's response to the concerns of working people. The greater activity and and increased unity of labor, African American, Latino, women's, youth and senior votes was the key to defeating Bob Dole and winning other races. It also showed the potential for greater Independence and bigger victories in the future. Labor '96 made the difference The role of the AFL-CIO and its Labor 96 campaign was historic. Without it, the outcome of the '96 elections would have been far more negative, indeed could have been tragic. With the financial and street muscle of Labor and its allies, it was possible to put the right wing on the defensive, defeat Dole, 12 of the "Gang of 73" and another half dozen of the most rabid GOP incumbents, and to nearly defeat 22 others. These are no small achievements considering that the Republican Right wanted to win all three branches of government by electing Dole, increasing their majorities in the U.S. House and in the Senate while winning additional state houses. If that had happened the Contract on America would have been on the fast track. Instead, the ultra-right Republicans, although they increased in their Senate majority, were blunted in their overall efforts and were put on the defensive. The militant class conscious forces for political independence have a new basis to go on the offensive on the legislative front and to elect pro-labor, working class candidates in local elections next year and the midterm Congressional elections in 1998. To list but a few of the outstanding victories won against the ultra-right on Nov. 5: * Rep. Cynthia McKinney of Georgia won overwhelmingly despite being forced to run in a newly redistricted 70 percent white district. * Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, the only Democratic incumbent up for reelection who voted against the Welfare Bill and an unapologetic progressive was reelected despite a well-financed national effort to unseat him. * Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband was killed and son seriously injured in the Long Island Railroad massacre, rejected the racist hysteria, and instead, changed from a life-long Republican to a Democrat to run for Congress and scored an impressive win over incumbent Dan Frisa, one of the Gang of 73. * Dennis Kucinich winning the Congressional seat of millionaire Martin Hoke in Ohio after overcoming a vicious redbaiting attack. * The defeat of Dick Zimmer for U.S. Senate in New Jersey, Rep. Dick Chrysler in Michigan, Gary Franks in Connecticut and in the State of Washington, the winning back of three of the six seats lost to the Gang in 1994. When seen along with the near-defeat of other members of the Gang of 73, the outcome of the 1996 elections shows that it is possible to achieve total defeat of the ultra-right in the future. The Communist Party in the 1996 elections was in harmony with the majority of working class voters. While we were sharply critical of Clinton and the Democratic Party, we understood that the most important challenge was to attack the main danger; the fascist threat coming from the far-right Republicans. Our efforts continued even after the Republicans, sensing the mood among the electorate, tried to hide Gingrich and other known extremists in their ranks. Our efforts, like the efforts of most, was to prevent them from expanding and solidifying their rule and implementing the Contract on America. Who voted against the right A powerful winning electoral coalition was born in the course of this 14-month struggle. The votes of union households, African Americans and Latinos, united with working class women, youth and seniors, made the difference. The most significant feature in this year's election was the role of organized labor. Instead of endorsing and providing resources for candidates, the Labor 96 campaign concentrated on education, registration and getting out the vote. Union leaders called on rank-and-file unionists to ignore party labels and "vote like a worker." The level of participation by African Americans, Latinos and women, including Catholic women, was at unprecedented levels. The emergence of the Latino vote is also important. Spurred on by the vicious attacks by the ultra right on immigrants, the Latino vote is reshaping the political landscape in important parts of the country. The Mexican American vote is now a powerful force in areas such as Orange County, Calif., long considered a bastion of the right wing. While the racist Proposition 209, misnamed the California Civil Rights Initiative, won and Harvey Gantt lost his bid to unseat notorious racist Sen. Jesse Helms in North Carolina, this election was marked by a high level of grass roots anti-racist unity of Black, Brown and white workers, especially in the deep South and in the far West. Our party, labor and the people's forces must study why, after the Republicans shifted their tactics in order to hide their extremism, the Democrats didn't respond which may have made a difference in close congressional races? Although economic issues were paramount in determining voting patterns, millions of voters, concerned about the Oklahoma City bombing of April 1995, the Gingrich-Dole conspiracy to cut Medicare and Medicaid, the government shutdown and church burnings, came to view extremism as a basic threat to democracy. This fear isolated Newt Gingrich, caused splits in Republican ranks and compelled millions of democratic-minded voters to reject the Republicans. Communist Party on the move Our party focused its energy in mobilizing and educating the voters on the key issues and bringing the danger of the ultra-right to the forefront of the political agenda. Hundreds of thousands of brochures and leaflets were distributed at union conventions and demonstrations, in mass mailings to labor and community leaders, given out door-to-door and at workplaces. Our aim was to reach the majority with the message, "Vote as if your life depends on it." From the primaries through the general election we carried on a crusade in the pages of the People's Weekly World to alert labor and the people's movements to what was at stake. We urged millions on syndicated talk shows to vote and who to vote against. Our coalition relations were strengthened with labor and community forces because we worked shoulder to shoulder in the critical struggle to register and mobilize voters and get them to the polls on Nov. 5. While we chose not to run candidates for national office, our local candidates were well received. Frank Soifer, who ran for mayor of Eugene, Ore., and David Mirtz, who ran for New York State Assembly, built grassroots bases that showed the necessity for the Communist Party to run campaigns to give a voice for all who seek a fundamental break with Big Business' domination of politics. Danger from the right remains Despite its many positives, the 1996 elections show that the danger from the far right remains. They have not given up on the Contract on America and will surely use their new strength in the Senate and Clinton's appeals to "bipartisanship" to advance their program. Passage of Prop. 209 in California and of welfare and immigrant "reform" legislation are clear signs that the racist danger remains. The battle against the right must continue, become better organized, more united and more demonstrative. While those who voted demonstrated a higher level of political understanding,we must understand that the vast majority who stayed home are an important part in the struggle to build an independent political movement. Although the third party initiatives in 1996 remained outside the main electoral arena, a large majority of people have great doubts about voting and the possibility of changing the direction of the two major parties. The Stand for Children in June, the Oct. 12 demonstration for immigration rights and the AFL-CIO's America Needs a Raise rallies in 30 cities plainly show people's anger and willingness to fight back. But we must examine why these sentiments were not fully expressed in the election booth. Although the elections held the ultra-right in check, the political and ideological struggles against their program must continue. This is the challenge for all forces of political independence and raises the question of how to organize the pressure for setting a new agenda in the 105th Congress. Although we can learn from labor's coalition-building efforts which won passage of a minimum wage increase and defeated the Team Act in the 104th Congress, our party, labor and the people's movements must take a deeper look at how to reach the majority stay-at-home vote. We have to take new initiatives for election law reform to create a more democratic guarantee that pro-labor, working class, Communist, left and other third-party candidates can get elected. Labor and the people's forces have established a lot of momentum out of this election. The challenge is to use that momentum to build a real bridge to the 21st century by rejecting the Contract, stopping the long-term decline in real wages, rejecting racism and organizing a movement for jobs, peace and equality. That bridge will be built with people's struggle for passage of the Martinez Jobs Bill, in the fight against racism, in struggles to reverse the Welfare Bill, to stop the attacks on immigrants and spread of Prop.209-like measures in other states. Real political independence and progress toward building a viable third party will take place in the context of building a movement for election law reform, to save public education and against poverty, unemployment and homelessness. A bridge to the 21st century must be a bridge to peace built by cutting the military budget, withdrawing U.S. troops from around the world and ending the immoral and illegal U.S. blockade of Cuba. Mass protest and action are the order of the day and are the surest guarantee that the right wing will not be able to regain the initiative. Let Clinton and the 105th Congress hear the angry voices and marching feet of millions demanding a progressive, pro-labor, anti-racist contract with the American people. That is our mandate.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. TUCSON, Ariz. - In a keynote speech to a Nov. 16 forum on prison labor, Patricia Clark compared prison labor in the U.S. to the maquiladora plants along the Mexican border. "Prison labor has taken a form much like maquiladoras" Clark said, adding that now, with privatization and "new" prison industries, prisoner labor has become a source of corporate superprofits. Clark, who heads up the criminal justice program for the American Friends Service Committee, spoke at a one-day meeting titled "Factories with Fences." In her presentation, Clark gave a compelling overview of a US prison system which, she said, "is headed for disaster." After pointing out that a majority of U.S. residents commit crimes for which they could be jailed, Clark reminded her audience that almost all prisoners are drawn from a narrow segment of society. "African American males, for example, make up only 6 percent of the total population, but account for the majority of prisoners," she said. "They are more likely to be arrested and more likely to be convicted." She said that white collar lawbreakers, on the other hand, are less likely to get caught and serve shorter sentences when they are. The forum was initiated by the American Friends Service Committee and cosponsored by the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, Salt of the Earth Labor College and groups concerned with peace and prisoner rights. Workshops were held on labor, chain gangs, privatization, and the rights of prison laborers. The labor workshop included a panel made up of Clark, local Jobs with Justice leader Steve Valencia and Fred Markusen and James Beverly, both of whom are correction employees. Markusen described how in the 20 years since he began working, the prison population increased tenfold. Beverly who is a leader of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, blasted the idea of private prisons, citing studies showing that private prisons suffer from high staff turnover, lower pay, a high level of violence and high escape rates. "They have no rehab programs," he said, and are run by those who have a "lock 'em up" mentality. Valencia said the issues of prison labor and privatization "are in character with the most vile features of corporate America." He said both were a "fast-track transfer of public wealth to private coffers."

CHICAGO - After a bitter 27-month strike and lockout, Bridgestone/Firestone (B/F), the world's largest tire manufacturer, has been forced to come to terms with the Steelworkers union (USWA). Under terms of a tentative agreement reached earlier this month, B/F has agreed to rehire all strikers, grant an unconditional amnesty to more than 40 union members discharged for alleged strike-related misconduct and make lump sum payments totalling $15 million to strikers who were not recalled when the union agreed to return to work in May 1995. Union members will vote by mail within two weeks and ballots will be counted by mid-December. During the battle, the union had organized a national consumer boycott and mobilized solidarity with unions representing B/F workers in 14 countries. The strike began July 12, 1994 when B/F refused to accept the pattern established between the United Rubber Workers union (URW) and other tire companies insisting, instead, on wage and benefit cuts and around-the-clock production with seven-day weeks and 12-hour shifts. It ended in May 1995 when the union agreed to return to work unconditionally and B/F, which had continued operations behind union picket lines, refused to rehire all strikers. The USWA "inherited" the strike in July 1995 when the URW merged with the larger union. Within days, the merged union launched a wide-ranging corporate campaign. to mobilize support for a decent contract at B/F. "We may have agreed to return to work unconditionally, but we did not surrender unconditionally," USWA President George Becker said at the time. The USWA conducted a militant, imaginative corporate campaign that saw picket lines at B/F outlets across the country. Steelworkers demonstrated at the Indianapolis 500 and other car races demanding that B/F be "black flagged." More than 30 city councils passed resolutions refusing to use of B/F tires on city vehicles. The union maintained a Camp Justice across the street from corporate headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. and sparked many steelworkers and other union supporters to run for public office on a platform of fighting for a settlement of the strike. In March 1996, the USWA organized an international meeting of unions representing B/F workers in Nashville and delegations of U.S. rubber workers traveled to Japan, France, Brazil, Argentina, and other countries where B/F has plants. The agreement provides for a $750 signing bonus, wage increases of 75 cents an hour over the life of the contract and B/F dropped its demand for increased co-pays for health insurance. If approved, the agreement expires on Sept. 1, 1999, the date that other contracts in the industry terminate. Sources in USWA headquarters told the World that the question of continuous production with seven-day weeks and 12-hour shifts had become a "non-issue" in final negotiations. It was removed from the bargaining table and left for resolution in local negotiations The union also agreed not to press unfair labor charges previously filed with the National Labor Relations Board. Local union officers expressed caution on how the membership might react to the agreement. Becky Bradish, recording secretary of USWA Local 310 in Des Moines said she was cautiously optimistic. "Working in a rubber factory, especially in the summer heat, is a hard enough job for eight hours a day - 12 hours is something else. I haven't seen the contract. We'll know more in a week or so. Meanwhile, I'm cautiously optimistic." When reached at the office of USWA Local 138 in Noblesville, Ind., Charley Gibson pointed out that at his plant B/F never imposed 12-hour shifts, even when operating with strike breakers. "I doubt that the company would find it effective because the quality of the product would go down if workers were forced to work 12 hours a day, three or four days a week." Though B/F claimed rising profits and production throughout the struggle, it could not ignore the negative effect of the union's relentless pressure on its public image and the clear evidence that the union would never quit the fight. Many of the lessons learned in the fight at B/F need to be applied to the prolonged battles at places like Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas, Diamond Walnut at Watsonville, Calif., Uno-Ven Oil at Lemont, Illinois. National and international labor solidarity, combined with independent political action and coalition-building, are crucial steps towards winning greater victories for labor in the coming period. -Fred Gaboury contributed to this story.

The cuban people defend and build their revolution by Tim Wheeler This article was reprinted from the December 7,1996 issue of thePeople's Weekly World. For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. HAVANA - After five years of belt-tightening and self-sacrifice to save their revolution, the Cuban people finally see signs of a dawn. The economy is once again growing after the collapse of the Soviet Union destroyed 85 percent of Cuba's export market, a blow that struck the island with the force of ten hurricanes. Washington saw it as their chance, finally, to finish off Cuban socialism. They enacted the Torricelli bill and the Helms-Burton bill to tighten the 34-year economic blockade, an act of war that still inflicts pain and suffering on the Cuban people. Jorge Mas Canosa and his Miami mafia were already packing their bags for a triumphant return to Havana. Their plans haven't panned out. Juan Triana Cordovi, director of the Center for the Study of the Cuban Economy, told me Cuba's 450,000 sugar cane workers are expected to harvest five million tons of sugar this year - double the tonnage during the depths of the "special period." The nickel miners have already produced 50,000 tons of refined nickel and cobalt in a joint venture with Sherritt International, the Canadian corporation that refuses to bow to Sen. Jesse Helms. Joint ventures in tourism and other industries are bringing in development capital. It is all the result of the determined hard work by millions of Cuban workers and campesinos. They possess the indomitable spirit of the "Old Man and the Sea." Everywhere I visited during a one-week tour of Havana and nearby cities, this month, I saw signs of the material shortages inflicted by the blockade. And everywhere I witnessed the quiet determination not to "say uncle" to Washington's pressure tactics. Two slogans can be seen on walls and buildings everywhere: "Si se puede!" (Yes we can do it!) and "Patria o Muerte" (Fatherland or death). Crowds wait with the patience of Job at bus stops. Every imaginable conveyance has been pressed into service, even ox carts. Hundreds of 1950s era Chevies trundle along, most of them running on hand-made spare parts. Soviet motorcycles with sidecars carry as many as five passengers. The Cubans have invented the "camel" a semi trailer with two humps pulled by a truck. Passengers are packed in like sardines. Thousands ride Chinese-manufactured bicycles, hitchhike or walk. There are similar chronic problems with fitful elevators, water, electricity, and telephone service. The "si se puede" spirit may be part of the Cuban character - but it is also organized by grassroots leaders like Maria Ducas Megret. In March 1993, Cuba held its first elections for municipal and national "Assemblies of People's Power." Maria Ducas Megret was elected to both the Municipal Assembly in Havana and the National Assembly representing the Marianao municipality, a neighborhood in west Havana where she lives. "Our aim was to create a structure that would be closer to the population so that we could be more effective in helping solve the problems faced by the people," she said as she led my interpreter and me on a walking tour of her district. Judging by the reception Ducas received from her constituents, Cuba's brand of grassroots democracy is working well. Everyone seemed to know her and rushed to embrace her. Dominating Marianao is a sprawling former military base, the Columbia Fortress, built by the U.S. after the defeat of Spain in 1898. When Cuba's Revolutionary Army liberated Havana in January 1959, this was dictator Fulgencio Batista's last stronghold. After it fell, the fort was renamed Ciudad Libertad (Freedom City). The barracks were converted into schools, a newly-constructed pediatric hospital, day care centers and a senior citizen center. Also located here is a teacher's college and Cuba's School of Fine Arts. The afternoon we visited, it was teeming with children enjoying after-school programs - sports, art, music and dance. Some children were demonstrating their skills with watercolors and pastels. Others were working with clay fashioning plates and bowls. A chorus of Young Pioneers sang patriotic songs and performed group dances. Gretel Gil, 12, showed me the plate she had made with an excellent likeness of Jose Marti glazed into its surface. "Jose Marti made speeches in Tampa and New York City calling for Cuba's independence," she told me. "He died fighting for freedom because we were ruled first by Spain and then the U.S." Maria Ducas took us to a residential neighborhood in Marianao where a group of volunteers, with the assistance of an architect and journeyman construction workers, built their own cinderblock apartment building, the Pilar House. Materials to construct the house were provided by the government. The housing shortage is so acute that every one of the eight apartments is already furnished, decorated and occupied. The roof is a spacious patio that commands a panorama of the entire neighborhood. People from throughout Havana are now coming to learn the Marianao brigade's building methods. We walked two blocks to the home of Rita Rios, another neighborhood activist. It was after dark by now but the house was packed with community residents who had gathered to welcome me. It included artists who use the Rios home as an art gallery and children who are studying dance at a neighborhood ballet school. Several years ago, Rios learned that the celebrated Cuban artist Wifredo Lam had lived in her home from 1941 to 1945 and had painted some of his greatest masterpieces there. Rios launched a campaign to restore the house. Residents have joined in the campaign - typical of the type of grassroots initiative the "Assemblies of People's Power" seeks to stimulate. "The revolution gave me this house and I decided that I must give something back," Rios told me. "I am a revolutionary." Havana's Spanish-style mansions date as early as the 16th century. They are decorated with fluted marble columns, ornate lintels and arches, wrought iron, stained glass and graceful porticos. The beauty is compounded by the lush semi-tropical vegetation-palm trees, blooming hibiscus and bougainvillea. The climate is so balmy that few houses have glass windows. Most are fitted with louvered shutters. Open them and soft breezes warmed by the Gulf stream flow through the houses on a November afternoon. Yet many of Havana's lovely dwellings are crumbling because of shortages of building materials. Here, too, I found a determined fightback. I went to the Maqueta de la Capital (Model of the Capital) in the Miramar municipality of Havana. This is a vast room-sized model of the city which enables the people to get a bird's-eye view of their city. Miguel Coyula, an architect who works with the Group for the Reconstruction of the Capital, a designer of the model, told me they are drawing up a plan for the restoration of the city, in part to make Havana a premier destination for tourism. "Havana is a living museum," he told me. "The elite did not destroy their homes to build new ones. They simply abandoned them and moved further west. Now they live in Florida. So all the architectural monuments of the past are still standing, ready to be restored." Already, reconstruction has begun in Old Havana. "Part of my job is liaison with neighborhoods, to encourage the people who live there to join in the effort to restore their communities." I told him we had just visited Wifredo Lam's house in Marianao. "Oh," he exclaimed, his eyes brightening. "Did you meet Maria Ducas? She is wonderful! The Wifredo Lam house is the kind of restoration project we are trying to encourage." I traveled to the Antero Regalado cooperative farm near San Antonio de los Banos where Israeli-designed cultivation houses are used to produce big succulent tomatoes - part of the drive to dramatically increase the supply of vegetables for the Cuban people. Here, too, the "Si se puede" principal was in force. There are no spare parts for the cooperative's fleet of aging Soviet tractors. Nivalbo Ortega, president of the co-op, showed me the machine shop with an aging turret lathe, drill press, and other machine tools where they manufacture spare parts. "Before the revolution, we had millions of hectares of land that served only the needs of the wealthy," he told me. "Now our task is to guarantee a balanced diet for the Cuban people." The 283-hectare co-op with 140 members produces vegetables that are sold to Acopio, the state agricultural marketing monopoly for distribution. Some of the tomatoes are earmarked for the restaurants in Cuba's spanking new hotels - part of the integrated economic complex to serve Cuba's new tourist industry. The Saturday before my departure, I was driven 100 miles east to Varadero Beach, its white sandy peninsula curving for miles into the Florida Gulf. Warmed by the Gulf stream, the water's are a brilliant turquoise blue. The DuPont family once owned much of Varadero and their mansion is still standing. But the commanding presence in Varadero today is the Cuban Communist Party. A big sign on the facade of the modern party headquarters proclaims "Patria o Muerte." Armando Castaneda and Osmany Almeida, two regional Party leaders, are assigned to oversee this bold foray into joint ventures with foreign corporations. Spanish, Italian, German, French, Canadian and Mexican corporations have flocked to Varadero. Jointly with Cuba they have built a necklace of five-star luxury hotels along Varadero Beach that are now filling up with thousands of tourists from Canada, Latin America and Europe. So far, 8,000 hotel room have been completed by 10,000 Cuban construction workers. Another 20,000 workers are employed in other parts of the tourist industry in Varadero. Profits are split 50-50 and Cuba retains ultimate ownership of the properties. "DuPont owned much of this and now the DuPonts are claiming it under the Helms-Burton law," said Castaneda with a chuckle. "The U.S. is losing, of course. The longer the blockade exists, the more behind they get. When they awake from their dreams, there won't be any space left for joint ventures with U.S. companies." It is not possible to take the measure of a nation and its people in one brief week. Yet there were so many poignant impressions I took home with me. I did not hear a single angry exchange between Cubans in the streets despite all the obvious hardships they face. Cuba is a remarkably multiracial society with Black, white and brown peoples living and working side-by-side. There is none of the racist segregation that divides our neighborhoods and schools. Pedro Ross Leal, a Cuban of African descent, is the president of the Cuban Labor Federation, a member of the ruling Council of State (equivalent to a cabinet minister). He granted me an interview and then took me to a celebration of the 35th anniversary of the founding of Cuba's Public Employees Union. As we entered the meeting hall, he handed me a lapel button. It read, "Yo creo en la solidaridad" (I believe in solidarity). The buttons had been sent by a sister union in Puerto Rico. Solidarity seems to be a way of life in Cuba and a big rock in the way of those who would destroy the Cuban people's power.

All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. NAFTA and the World Trade Organization (WTO) are tools with whichpowerful corporations manipulate the "free market" to control theflow of goods and money around the globe. The terms of thesetreaties are subject neither to local nor to national law but tothe decisions of their boards of directors which answer tocorporate masters. The same may be said of the World Bank (WB)and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These institutions determine who receives how much credit andwhen - conditional on the implementation of neoliberal policiesspecified by the suppliers of capital - again the powerfultransnational corporations. When loans are contingent on the saleof natural resources and the privatization of state enterpriseswith the corresponding dismissal of public workers, countriesbecome unable to develop their own economies and their burden ofdebt increases until it is, for all intents and purposes,unpayable. Burdened with debt and unable to make long-terminvestments in their own futures they are obliged to import thebasics of life. Corporate concentration of capital thus proceedsapace, dividing us into a shrinking world of privilege astride ahuge and growing world of abject poverty. Unless publicboundaries are placed on this flow of private capital,concentration will continue and at its end is disaster, as surelyfor the fortunate few, as for the oppressed billions. That the world's governments and leaders are not unaware of thisdisastrous course of events was evidenced at the World Summit forSocial Development held in Copenhagen, Denmark in March 1995.Present for the largest gathering of world leaders held untilthat time, 117 heads of state "pledged to make the conquest ofpoverty, the goal of full employment, and the fostering ofstable, safe and just societies their overriding objectives." Theover 14,000 people who participated in the summit includedrepresentatives of 186 countries and 811 non-governmentalorganizations and some 2,800 journalists. Because over one billion - 20 percent - of the people on earthlive on the equivalent of less than $1 a day, the summitgovernments declared 1996 the International Year for theEradication of Poverty and committed themselves to that goal inthe summit's Declaration and Programme of Action. Each government pledged to develop a national poverty eradicationplan that would promote sustained economic growth in a frameworkof "sustainable development and equal opportunity." The planwould expand productive employment, using policies for full,decently paid and freely chosen work. The governments pledged to protect human rights and promotesocial integration, committing themselves to halting today'sextreme social polarization and burgeoning urban shantytowns andto ending the illicit trading in arms, drugs and in human beings,especially women and children. They committed themselves to worktoward attaining gender equality and equality before the law,toward ensuring access to control over economic and socialresources and activities to disadvantaged and vulnerable groupsand to protecting the rights of the indigenous. Finally, theyagreed to strengthen cooperation for their social developmentplans through the United Nations. Each year the U.N. issues a Human Development Report in which itquantifies national development according to an Index with threekey components: longevity, measured by life expectancy at birth;knowledge, based on literacy rates and schooling; and standard ofliving, measured by purchasing power based on Gross DomesticProduct (GDP) per capita adjusted for cost of living. Seen in this framework the aims of the Copenhagen Summit include:primary health care, particularly of women and children; familyplanning services including prenatal care; safe drinking waterand an end to malnutrition; universal and equitable access toeducation for all children with particular attention to schoolsin rural areas, and to the children of migrant or nomadic peoplesand the indigenous; and increased adult literacy, particularly ofwomen. At the end of the summit meeting the governments also committedthemselves to ratifying and implementing the 1990 Convention onthe Rights of Children. These pledges must now be ratified andimplemented in each country. Only action on the part of localgrassroots organizations will exert the pressure necessary toobtain ratification in each country. The riches to resolve these problems are clearly not lacking. Toraise the requisite funds some of the following might beconsidered: A transaction tax on speculative foreign exchange. This "betting"on the futures of currencies and international notes moves $1trillion in the world's financial markets every day - more thanthe value of all the purchases and sales combined. Such a taxwould slow purely speculative capital investment; the tradingfirms dealing in precisely such transactions generate more incomethan any other "industry." First proposed by James Tobin, 1991Nobel Prize Winner in Economics, an 0.5 percent tax wouldgenerate over $1.5 trillion a year. A globally agreed-upon limit to the interest specified forinternational loans made to developing countries. This would makecredit more readily available to those who most need it. Loansshould not be contingent of the sale of state-owned enterprisesor land, rermoving subsidies on food or the dismissal of publicworkers. The complete cancellation of the foreign debt of developingcountries has been suggested and some debt has, in fact, beenforgiven. Complete cancellation is not likely, given theintransigence of transnational corporations and the internationalfinancial agencies such as the World Bank and InternationalMonetary Fund. However cancellation of the interest payments dueon those debts should be considered. The money thus releasedcould be earmarked for social development. A globally agreed-upon rate for the taxation of profits taken outof developing countries. Three quarters of this tax could revertto the developing country; the remaining quarter could bedirected to a world body such as the UN's Food and AgricultureOrganization, or its Children's Fund or to a U.N. operating fund. Each nation should commit itself to cutting its military and armsbudget until that budget reaches no more than ten percent of itstotal national budget. In 1992, world military spending - $815billion - equaled the combined income of 49 percent of theworld's people. A mere 3 percent annual reduction in thisspending would yield a "peace dividend" of nearly $460 billion bythe year 2000. In his Agenda for Peace, U.N. Secretary GeneralBoutros Boutros Ghali proposed a tax on the defense budgets ofindustrial nations to finance the U.N.'s emergency peacekeepingfund. Parallel to those cuts, the nations which possess nuclearstockpiles should commit themselves to cutting those stockpilesby half each year for 10 years after which the remainingstockpiles should be completely destroyed. Part or all of themoney recovered by these two measures could be channeled to aninternational development fund so that the world's people couldtruly "beat their swords into plowshares." Since capital flows freely across national boundaries in searchof opportunity, labor must be able to do likewise. Developednations must reach agreements with developing nations for theprovision for workers who migrate from the latter to the formerin search of employment. At the same time, the world's nationsmust agree to a minimum standard for wages. The implementation of these last two measures ought to be seen asgoals: they will only be possible when the previous points havebeen addressed and implemented. That they will be depends on justhow firmly we believe that where there is a will there is a way.As has so often been said, it is not money which is lacking butpolitical will. -Julia Lutsky contributed to this article.

NEW YORK - When David Mirtz finishes his daily shift as a Manhattan UPS driver, he hits the streets of the Bronx seeking votes in his campaign for the New York State Assembly. He hammers away with his slogans, "People before profits! Tax the rich! Rebuild the Bronx!" In a city torn by poverty, unemployment, homelessness, crime and drugs, Mirtz, 31, who lives in a Bronx Co-op with his family, is the true messenger of hope. He is the candidate of the Communist Party USA to represent New York's 80th assembly district. More than 3,000 voters signed petitions to place him on the ballot and Mirtz' campaign workers have signed up 700 new voters. Early in his campaign, Mirtz spoke at an AFL-CIO "America Needs a Raise" rally at Hostos Community College in the Bronx. "When I introduced myself as a candidate of the Communist Party USA, you could hear a pin drop," Mirtz said with a chuckle. "I told the crowd that a $5.15 an hour minimum wage is a step in the right direction but it is not nearly enough. I got a great response. People clapped and cheered." New York's public schools opened this fall with reports of overcrowding so extreme that classes were crammed into closets and lavatories. Mirtz, newly-married and concerned about quality education, convened a sidewalk news conference in front of P.S. 20 in the Bronx. "We have a state of emergency in the schools," Mirtz told the crowd as reported in the Riverdale Press, Sept. 26. "The city and state should make funds available to do things now. Vouchers and sending 1,000 kids to Catholic schools are just distractions," he added, referring to New York's Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's panacea for dealing with the crisis. Mirtz lashes Republicans for their drive to terminate welfare and other benefit programs. He scorns the GOP pleas that the public till is empty in a city with Wall Street banks crammed with tens of billions in profits. "All the talk about cutting back and downsizing - that's the corporate agenda," Mirtz told the news conference. By coincidence, the incumbent Democratic assemblyman, Jeffrey Klein, showed up during Mirtz' news conference. BronxNet, a local cable news channel, broadcast a full report quoting both Mirtz and Klein. "Just knowing that we are in the race changes the political spectrum. We bring out much more clearly what is at stake in these elections." Mirtz told this reporter. This is Mirtz' second run for office. In 1992 he ran as a Tax-the-Rich independent for the State Assembly to represent part of Harlem and Washington Heights, a section of Manhattan where he grew up. He attended Hunter College and was a leader of the citywide shutdown in 1989 of the City University of New York (CUNY) in protest against a $200 increase in tuition. "We won that fight," Mirtz said. He joined the Young Communist League and the Communist Party. Later he was elected national coordinator of the YCL. Mirtz said his ballot petitioners this past summer ran into more surprise than anti-communism. "One of our comrades distributed my campaign brochure in the Co-op where we live.The next morning a neighbor came up a bit breathless. 'There's a guy running for the State Assembly as a Communist! Isn't that terrific?'" Many older people, he said, remember the Party from years past. "But many younger people are hearing about the Party for the first time. It's such a step up when people know that there is a Communist Party organization in the neighborhood, that we are active on all the basic issues." It includes even the Yankees' recent World Series victory which has turned the city, and especially the Bronx, delirious with joy. Mirtz is a Yankee fan who rejects proposals to move the team into a new stadium in Manhattan. "Yankee Stadium is the 'house that Ruth built,'" he said, referring to the legendary Yankee slugger, Babe Ruth. "[Yankee owner George] Stein-brenner's push to move the team out of the Bronx reflects his greed and disregard for the people of New York and history." Mirtz was a panelist at a candidates forum at St. Brendan's Roman Catholic Church in the Norwood neighborhood recently. "This is a mainly Catholic white working class section," he said. "They were very 'pro-life.' But on other issues such as the budget cuts and helping the poor, this was not a right-wing crowd at all. Someone asked me about the Party's attitude toward religion. I told him our conflict is not with religion or God, but with capitalism." Mirtz made his pitch for the defeat of the Republican ultra right. "When I got home there was an e-mail message from one of the participants telling me I had three votes - hers, her husband's and one of the other panelists. Her message said, 'Your candidacy has made it worthwhile to go out and vote.'" No wonder voters are sick and disheartened. In a cynical maneuver, the Republican and Demo-cratic machines in the Bronx made a deal: in exchange for support on certain legislation Democrats agreed not to challenge incumbent Republican State Senator Guy Velella, whose district encompasses much of the 80th. "This is a right-wing Republican the Democrats should have targeted for defeat. Instead they nominated Velella on the Democratic line. We are the real alternative to the right-wing extremists in the Bronx." Rich Giovanoni, who serves as treasurer of Mirtz' campaign, said Mirtz is an effective candidate with a good speaking style, a quick wit and a mastery of the issues. But more than that, Mirtz is the most visible candidate. "What we notice most is that we are the only ones out campaigning on the streets here. There's no one else," Gio-vanoni said. "They're having a get-out-the-vote rally at the Allerton Coops [housing project] this Saturday. The Tenants Association is a sponsor, Giovanoni added." Among the speakers at the rally will be Kathy Ciner, the president of Communications Workers of America Local 1105, Janice Walcott, who is the president of the Tenants Associa-tion, Mirtz and Jeffrey Klein, the incumbent. Mirtz speaks with passion when he appeals to Communist Party organizations across the country to field more candidates in future elections. "There's no substitute for the CPUSA running its own candidates," he said. "We have spoken to tens of thousands of people. There are so many people who want to know about the Party and what we stand for. This is a chance to tell people what we're all about. A working people's program for the Bronx Put the Bronx back to work Layoffs, unionbusting, poverty wages and part-time jobs is Big Business' agenda for working people. People need jobs at a living wage to live decent lives. We need a public works jobs program to rebuild New York at union wages with affirmative action guidelines. Double the minimum wage and guarantee the right to organize. Outlaw scabs. Protect workers' pensions and compensation. Tax the rich to fund people's needs End welfare for the rich and Big Business, not the people. Close tax loopholes and raise corporate taxes and taxes on the rich. Halve the tax rate of those who earn less than $50,000. Save our youth Curfews may keep kids off the streets but it won't give them a future. We must take emergency steps to save our youth. Defend public education. Full funding for public schools, recreational and cultural facilties, after school and youth job programs. Restore free tuition at the City University of New York. End Racism - Equality for all We need civilian control of the police to end harassment and attacks on Black and Latino people. Save affirmative action; only together can we beat the Big Business agenda that is impovering our communities. Healthcare for all We need free universal healthcare. Stop corporate profiteering at the expense of the elderly and sick. Stop the privatization of public city hospitals. Save Medicaid and Medicare. Housing is a right. Stop skyrocketing rents. Stop landlords warehousing apartments and violating building codes. Build affordable quality public housing. Reduce property taxes on small home owners.

Winpisinger, who served aspresident of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) from 1977 to 1990, now enjoys a blissful retirement,touring the nation with his wife, Pearl, in their motor home. When at home near Baltimore, "Wimpy" (as he likes to be called) often picks up his grandchildren after school. Last summer, the Winpisingers traveled to Alaska. They were so impressed by the natural splendor of the state that Winpisinger was wearing a T-shirt decorated with the Alaska State logo when Communist Party Labor Commission Chairman George Meyers and I met him over breakfast recently. Winpisinger may be retired but his influence is still felt in the labor movement. Many say he plowed the ground and planted seeds for the AFL-CIO's remarkable rejuvenation since its 1995 convention in New York City when John Sweeney was elected president in the labor federation's first-ever contested election. Linda Chavez-Thompson and Richard Trumka joined him as executive vice president and secretary- treasurer. "They've made the fur fly ever since," Winpisinger said. Winpisinger is impressed. "I think they get an A-plus for their efforts," he said. "There has been a substantial energizing of the labor movement since they took over. Organized labor's efforts in the 1996 elections really stand out. That victory holds the promise of better things to come across a broad front." Labor, Wimpy said, played a crucial role in the defeat of GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole and many Republican extremists in the House and Senate. "I knew the AFL-CIO was doing something right when [Republican Party Chairman] Haley Barbour and the rest of the Republican leadership started squalling about the $35 million the labor movement raised for its election activities. That is peanuts compared to the $262 million the corporations contributed to the Republicans, but it's the first competition they've had in a long time." Winpisinger said labor should work to avoid open clashes with a second Clinton administration but added, "We're going to have to cajole the man in order to hold our own. I have seen very few instances where you go out and fight the good fight that you don't get some kind of results." But Winpisinger has no illusions about the Democratic Party. He told us a story about the struggle during the Carter administration to pass Labor Law Reform. The AFL-CIO's efforts fell one vote short of the 60 votes needed to end a Senate filibuster and Florida's Democratic Senator Lawton Chiles promised to vote to end the debate. But at the last minute he reneged. A few months later, Chiles came to the IAM seeking reelection help. "I told him we would give him just as much support as he gave us on Labor Law Reform." As long as the status quo continues, Winpisinger said, "we'll always be faced with the lesser of two evils because we never develop a candidate recruitment and training program where we put our own people in the field and try to elect them." In this election, labor started to change that, setting up its own independent grassroots apparatus to support candidates who would challenge the Gingrich gang. "No matter where I was during this election year," he said, "you could feel labor's new vitality at the grassroots. That's contagious." Winpisinger praised the Communist Party USA for its role in exposing and helping to defeat Dole and other right-wing extremists. "The Party played an important role in the elections this year," he said. The Republican platform included immediate development and deployment of "Star Wars," a space-based weapons system, now supported by President Clinton. The system will cost at least $300 billion, the costliest in history, with Boeing and Lockheed Martin the prime contractors. I asked Winpisinger for his views. "I don't know of a single scientist who says it will work," he said. "I used to debate a Reagan administration guy who was obsessed with Star Wars. The guy was a nut case." In the mid-1980s, Winpisinger spoke out strongly against the arms race and for economic conversion, a stand that enraged some IAM members at McDonnell Douglas. Winpisinger told us he made many trips to St. Louis to meet with the workers - and won them over. "I asked them: 'What do we do when the government changes its mind? If it ever does, you're going to be the first ones axed. I think we ought to be prepared with a program of conversion to insure that you have jobs and income.' Now they sidle up to me: 'Wimpy, how did you know this was going to happen?' I didn't - but part of a union's job is to look ahead." Winpisinger pointed to the immense increase in worker productivity in the past 30 years and to Bethlehem Steel's nearby Sparrows Point mill which once employed 30,000 workers but now produces more steel with 5,700 workers. For Wimpy there's only one answer: "Reduce the hours of work, as they have already done in Europe," with no cut in pay. Winpisinger hailed the AFL-CIO's America Needs a Raise campaign. "We need to use our power more judiciously than ever before - focus it very tightly and not go out with a scatter gun," he said. "We focused on the minimum wage and we won a victory. And it's not a selfish interest. It's across the board. We're portrayed as a special interest but I can't remember an issue that we've fought for that didn't advance the living standards of all the people." The change in the AFL-CIO was not a surprise to Winpisinger who said it "came naturally. There was no preconceived plan for John Sweeney to emerge. The change was brought about by necessity." Winpisinger pooh-poohs suggestions that he got the ball rolling. "All I did was speak my piece," he said. "I felt that the labor movement had stagnated because the leadership became too complacent. They didn't want to take a chance on anything. Life is really a crap game and if you risk nothing, you gain nothing." Winpisinger, an accomplished stump orator with a sharp tongue and keen wit, unleashed one broadside after another on the delusions peddled by class collaborationist labor leaders after he was elected IAM president in 1977. Rank and file workers loved his irreverent speaking style. Much of Winpisinger's thinking is reflected in his 1989 book, "Reclaiming the Future - An Agenda for American Labor" (Westview Press, 5500 Central Ave. Boulder, CO 80301). Based on Winpisinger's many speeches, the book burns with anger against the the Fortune 500 and their agents in government who unleashed a brutal drive to impose a "union free environment" and covered it with soothing cliches about "labor-management partnership." In the chapter, "Labor Relations Today," Winpisinger writes, "You don't need to be a Marxist to observe that the conflict between capital and labor is as old as the history of the world ... In the last decade, class war has been declared not by trade unions or working people on their employers but by our employers and recently by our government on us." For Wimpy, born in Cleveland, Ohio, on Dec. 10, 1924, militancy came early. His father was a union typographer at the Cleveland Plain Dealer. "I can remember as vividly as yesterday when I was 10 years old, my father coming home from night shift with the morning edition of the Plain Dealer. It had a picture on the front of a mountain of potatoes that was being bulldozed somewhere down in Georgia - and this in the depths of the Depression and people were starving." Winpisinger recalled, "I said to myself, 'What a crime! Why not distribute those potatoes to hungry people?' And the answer was: You couldn't do that! It would be socialism! I became a socialist - not a doctrinaire socialist but a seat-of-the-pants socialist." Now, he said, "we've come full circle - back to the situation where the gap between rich and poor is becoming wider and wider. They are driving us into a corner and we will fight!" When Winpisinger delivered speeches along those lines in the late 1970s, he was greeted by millions of working people across the country - yet at the leadership level, his was a lonely voice. Then came Ronald Reagan. "Reagan showed people what can happen when you've got a despotic s.o.b. in the White House," Winpisinger said. "Reagan gets a lot of credit for labor's resurgence - unwitting I'm sure, because Corporate America didn't believe we could do it. These birds are full of hops and are always ready to write our obituary. "I constantly told people before I retired that there is a future for this movement. Without it, everybody is helpless before the absolute workplace power of the boss." There were many harbingers of the things to come during the Reagan-Bush years, he said. Reagan's mass firing of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers (PATCO) in August 1981 was one. The AFL-CIO Executive Council was meeting in Chicago the morning after the PATCO strike began. PATCO had endorsed Reagan in the mistaken view that he would go easy on them should they strike. Nor had the union consulted with the AFL-CIO before walking out. Nevertheless, when the walkout and mass firing took place, Winpisinger announced that he would support the solidarity walkout provided it was an across-the-board walkout. But no one else on the executive council picked up on this proposal for what would have amounted to a general strike. Rather, the most conspicuous action by the AFL-CIO was Solidarity Day in which more than half a million trade unionists marched up Constitution Ave. on Sept. 19, 1981 with PATCO leading the way. Next in line was a huge IAM contingent carrying a curb-to-curb banner reading, "Jobs Not Bombs." "It was militancy rearing its head," Winpisinger said. "People wanted a more action-oriented labor movement." Major strike battles followed - the Pittston Coal strike, Ravenswood and, more recently, strikes at Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Bridgestone-Firestone. "Grassroots support developed for these strikers," he said. "It convinced everybody that the will was there. It was a question of getting it organized." A source of "disrepute" for labor in years past, according to Winpisinger, was "intramural warfare when we should have been fighting the boss." He was referring to unions competing for members, raiding each other and even in some cases crossing each others picketlines. Now, he said, the labor movement is entering a period of increased solidarity and joint action. That, in turn, is promoting the idea of mergers, the biggest of all the proposed amalgamation of the IAM with the United Auto Workers and the United Steel Workers of America. Winpisinger told us that he and then-UAW President Douglas Fraser had opened talks on a merger back in the mid-1980s. When Owen Beiber succeeded Fraser, the talks were halted. " Then a few years later, Beiber came up to me and said, 'Hey, it's time to talk about a merger.' I told him, 'We never stopped talking about it. The ball is in your court.'" Winpisinger said the unification into one union of machinists, autoworkers, steelworkers, rubber workers and glass workers is "a monumental task but it will be something to behold if they can bring it off. For the first time, we will be able to look at our biceps and say, we're not a mosquito bite anymore. It's about time that when we sit down at the bargaining table we have a howitzer as big as theirs!" As he drained the last of his coffee, Winpisinger turned philosophical. "There's no question that the old leadership got in a rut and couldn't get out because they didn't have enough confidence in the American worker. People are not likely to join a powerless organization. If they pay union dues, they want a union." Then, his voice taking on the tone that that still inspires unionists, he added, "This economy is driven by the price-gouging of the entrepreneurs, not by wages. Wages have fallen behind and not enough is being done to make it up. Now we're beginning to talk about it. "I see a determination at the grassroots level to get new members enrolled. And if that relentless pressure is kept on, the movement will grow. If we do our work right, it will attract people like honey attracts bees. We're demonstrating the ability to get in and mix it up to accomplish labor's fundamental goals."

Ambassador Madeline Albright as secretary of state and Republican Senator William Cohen of Maine as defense secretary. As part of the "shake up," Clinton also appointed national security advisor Anthony Lake CIA chief and Lake's deputy, Samuel Berger, to the national security council job. The appointments, which are subject to Senate confirmation, received praise from Democrats and Republicans, including Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who called for a new spirit of bipartisanship. Peace forces, however, took a different view of the appointments. Vice-Admiral John Shanahan, director of the Center for Defense information, said secretary Cohen would be "nibbling around the margins of the defense budget, rather than taking a serious look at reducing spending." "I would like to think that the new secretary of defense would come up with a plan to reduce expenditures at least $50 billion. I sense that what will happen, however, is that expenditures will be kept at current levels," he said in a telephone interview. Shanahan pointed to new military aircraft already in the authorization stage, including the F-22, the F-16 and the so-called "joint strike fighter" - which will cost $360 billion to design and manufacture - as "unnecessary expenditures" that benefit only defense contractors. "It's no secret that companies like Lockheed and Boeing [which will build the new aircraft] have too much influence on Congress," Shanahan told the World. He said the American people want more spending on health care and education and "according to a recent poll, 70 percent want to spend less on the Pentagon." Cynde Nordone, a Catholic nun who directs a local chapter of Jobs with Peace, sees the appointments signaling business as usual in Washington. "Unfortunately, I've not heard or seen anything yet [from Clinton's new team] that would indicate a resolve to reduce military spending," she said. Nordone is a member of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, an order which works with poor women in Baltimore. She agrees with Shanahan that money should be taken from military spending and put into domestic programs. The appointment that has received the most attention is that of Albright. She is said to be fervently anti-Cuba, which explains the warm endorsement she received from Jesse Helms. Albright is not generally liked in the U.N., where she has spearheaded the effort to dump popular secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

NEW YORK - The United Farm Workers and the AFL-CIO have launched the biggest organizing drive of an industry in 40 years as they begin a united effort to unionize 20,000 strawberry pickers. Those who work the strawberry fields work as many as 12 hours a day stooped over in the mud for an average of $20 a day. The "National Strawberry Commission for Worker's Rights," a coalition of more that 40 national organizations, has held press conferences in Washington, New York, Boston, Baltimore and other cities to build support for the pickers across the country. Times are good for the strawberry industry with record sales of over $650 million and production topping a billion pounds. The growers are concentrated in California but the strawberry industry is dominated by eight giant corporations which buy, "cool," market and distribute the product around the globe. "Coolers" tell the growers what type and amount of strawberries to grow, and even the type and amount of pesticides to use in the process. Strawberries picked in California end up as far away as France and Japan. Per capita consumption of strawberries has grown from three pounds in 1974 to five pounds in 1994. Today strawberries are the fifth largest-selling crop in the country. If growth continues at its present pace - doubling between 1971 and 1980 and again between 1981 and 1990 - the industry would gross $1.1 billion by the year 2000 and $2 billion by 2010. The strawberry companies also receive help from their friends in government. Last year the federal government contributed close to $500,000 to subsidize the industry's overseas marketing. And the California Strawberry Commission, which consists of growers, shippers, processors and one public member, levies a tax on the industry which last year netted $4.5 million to be invested in the industry in the form of marketing and research. Recently, however, the companies have used part of this money to fight off accusations and improve their public image through advertising in the media. For the workers, on the other hand, the fruit of their labor has not been so sweet. The average picker earns $8,500 per season. But this is only an estimate since some are paid by the hour, others by the crate and still others by a combination of both methods. Piece rates are often less than minimum wage and no premium pay for overtime. When inflation is considered, the income of strawberry workers, who have not had a considerable raise in a decade, has plummeted between 25 and 53 percent. The cost of housing takes a considerable share of this income as dilapidated motels rent for $150-$200 a week. The growers have various techniques for evading their responsibilities to the workers. Their favorite is having the pickers work as sharecroppers. This means they lease land to a person who turns over much of the crop to the field owner as payment for operating the field. Up to half of the state's strawberry workers are sharecroppers. But, sharecroppers must take whatever price is offered by the owner of the land and they often end up further in debt at the end of a season. The sharecroppers, who are already under financial strain, often employ others who are legally the responsibility of the land owners. This situation increases the level of exploitation. Another danger faced by the strawberry workers is pesticides. The rate of pesticides on strawberries can be up to 50 times that of grapes. The fields are covered with up to 300 pounds of pesticide per acre, more than any other crop in the state. More than four million pounds of methyl bromide is injected into the ground each year to fumigate the soil. Methyl bromide has been linked to over 400 illnesses and was scheduled to be banned this year. But after heavy lobbying by the growers the California legislature delayed the ban. The Western Growers Association gave more than $30,000 to California Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign fund in 1994. There are also widespread violations of state labor laws including child labor, sexual harassment, filthy - or no - bathrooms and no drinking water. Leobaldo Acosta, a strawberry worker from Salinas, Calif., said at the New York press conference on Nov. 21, "We have to work in the fields when it rains, in the mud and after accidents. We are not scared of working - we're just demanding a just wage. We have decided as farm workers that unity is the only way." Delfina Rodriguez, a mother of two, described how even after suffering a back accident she had to continue working to provide for her children. The president of the New York City Central Labor Council, Brian McLaughlin, said at the conference, "We are not going to sit by as the companies buy off elected officials," and urged everyone to wage the type of grassroots campaign that brought victory to the grape workers. Arturo Rodriguez, president of the United Farm Workers of America, called for a 5 cent increase in the price of a pint which consumers buy in stores which would result in a worker's salary being increased by 50 percent. The other demands of the union are clean drinking water and bathrooms, job security, health insurance, and an end to sexual harassment and other abuses. Speaking at the conference in Washington, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said, "Strawberry workers aren't on the bottom step of the economic ladder - they're not even on the ladder." Sweeney said African-American workers in Southern manufacturing plants, Asian Americans in sweatshops and restaurant workers are also on the same downward spiral. Calling for unity, he said, "Our fight is their fight and their fight is our fight." A.L. Everett, president of the Texas Central Labor Council, told the World that they are also working with the national leadership supporting the campaign for justice for the strawberry pickers. The strategy of the UFW and AFL-CIO is to pressure the coolers to acknowledge that they control the industry and are accountable for the abuses they create and be encouraged to help improve conditions for strawberry workers. It is believed this pressure will convince the growers to negotiate a nationwide agreement which will improve the lives of the 20,000 workers.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. On Nov. 5, progressive people in the U.S. will be voting as if our lives depend upon it. For African American workers, the need to push back the racist, right-wing assault is indeed a life or death issue. Racism in the U.S. is being pushed forward by the right wing to split our class unity. The racially oppressed, the targets of the right-wing racist assault, actually have our health imperiled by racism. A recent study published by the American Journal of Public Health states that racial discrimination is seen as a major cause of high blood pressure in African Americans. Keeping anger and resentment bottled up, according to the study, is a key factor in why African Americans have higher rates of this life-threatening disease than white workers. High blood pressure is far more common in Blacks than in whites and is also more common to people, according to the report, of "lower social economic status." More than 37 percent of Black men over the age of 20 have hypertension, compared with 25 percent of white men. More than 31 percent of Black women have the disease of hypertension, compared with 18 percent of white women. The new study, conducted by epidemiologists at the Harvard School of Public Health and Kaiser Foundation Research Institute, is an eye-opener as to the insidious effects of racism and the human damage that the need to constantly battle that racism has on the African American population as a whole. Nancy Krieger and Stephen Sidney questioned 4,086 men and women recruited in Birmingham, Ala, Chicago and Minneapolis as part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants were divided by race and sex. All were between 18 and 30 years of age when the study began in 1985. According to Krieger, "Our study was intended to tell whether it makes a difference to ask questions about racial discrimination in order to help understand the variation of blood pressure among African Americans, and also to understand the Black-white differences in blood pressure. The answer is: It makes a difference." Researchers asked if a person had ever experienced discrimination based on race and other variables such as "social class." The places in which African Americans were asked if they had experienced discrimination included school, on the job, while looking for work, while seeking housing, during medical care, on the street, or from the police or courts. Overall, 77 percent of Black women and 84 percent of Black men reported experiencing racial discrimination in at least one of the seven specified situations. Nearly 50 percent of Black women and 60 percent of Black men reported discrimination in three or more categories. Among Black working class men and women, those who reported "no racial discrimination" had systolic pressures 4 points higher on average than those who reported one or two episodes of discrimination. "No discrimination" was not taken on its face by the researchers, however. Instead, they saw that as evidence of "internalized oppression" in the response. That "internalized oppression" can clearly be seen as a factor that contributed to the higher blood pressure in those respondents. While this study tells most of us nothing that we did not know beforehand - that racism kills - it is a point to ponder as we head toward Election Day. Among all the other solid working-class issues that demand that we vote to change the Congressional majority - to "boot Newt" and his gang of 73 - and to send Bob Dole into retirement, is simply to understand that the cost of having the right wing in place, dismantling affirmative action programs and affirming the right of racists to discriminate against African American workers in housing, health care and education is a cost too high to pay.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. SAN FRANCISCO - The ACLU affiliates in Northern andSouthern California - working with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, the Employment Law Center and a coalition of civil rights organizations - filed a lawsuit in federal district court in San Francisco last week to block implementation of Proposition 209. Plaintiffs, which include a broad spectrum of business, education and civil rights groups and individuals, charge that the anti-affirmative action initiative, approved yesterday by California voters, violates the 14th Amendment and the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. "No statewide measure in American history has ever come close in scope or effect to Proposition 209's chokehold on state and local government," said Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the ACLU of Southern California. "The measure treats the unfinished business of rooting out discrimination as if it were none of the government's business," Rosenbaum said. "While the measure is breathtaking in its sweep, there is nothing new in its methodology which disenfranchises minorities and women from reliable and effective participation in our political process." Plaintiffs argue that Prop. 209 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because it would block legislation needed to protect minorities and women from discrimination. "While other groups may continue to pursue their interests in attaining preferential legislation and policies at every level of state and local government ... racial minorities, under Proposition 209, may now only do so by securing a popular majority and amending the state constitution." "The anti-affirmative action law," said Ted Wang of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, "would prevent governments from eliminating ongoing, identified discrimination." Alluding to Prop. 209's text of 37 words, attorney Judith Kurtz of Equal Rights Advocates said, "With just over 35 words, Proposition 209 would negate 35 years of progress." "This law turns back the clock on women's advancement," said Kathy Rodgers, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. "Without affirmative action, women will once again lose critical opportunities for economic equality." Plaintiffs contend the initiative violates the Equal Protection clause by barring women and minorities from seeking protective race- or gender-conscious legislation when other groups are permitted to seek whatever preferential treatment they please. Further, plaintiff attorneys say that Prop. 209 prevents state and local governments from meeting their constitutionally-mandated duty to remedy discrimination against women and racial minorities. "Proposition 209 would not only prevent states from adopting affirmative action programs designed to serve compelling interests, it would prevent them from fulfilling their constitutional duty under the Equal Protection Clause to redress past discrimination against minorities," court documents argue. "Proposition 209 undermines enforcement of federal civil rights laws which depend upon voluntary compliance by government agencies, compliance which often requires affirmative action to undo the effects of prior discrimination," said Ed Chen, attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. "By outlawing all public affirmative action programs, the measure interferes with governmental efforts to comply voluntarily with federal civil rights laws."

WARREN, Ohio - Unions across three states are raisingmoney and mobilizing their members to bring holiday joy to the families of some 4,500 members of five Steelworkers union locals who have been on strike against Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel since Oct. 1. Jerry Hartshorn, secretary of the grievance committee at Steelworkers Local 1375 here, said the local had filled three buses by midweek. "And we're taking $5,000 with us." Hartshorn told the World that $4,300 was collected at the plant gate of the Warren Consolidated Industries steel mill. "The local threw in enough to make it an even $5,000," he said. Pointing to the victory that forced Bridgestone/Firestone to come to terms with the USWA after a bitter 27-month strike and lockout, Hartshorn said "W-P is the next battle the union has to win. We did it at Ravenswood Aluminum and here at WCI and we can do it there." W-P forced the strike when management refused to fulfill its promise to reestablish a defined benefits pension plan and instead gave the union a "last, best and final" offer that would have allowed the company to gut insurance coverage and totally eliminate seniority, craft and contracting out protection. On Dec. 4 the USWA sent a letter to the company reaffirming its willingness to resume negotiations "any time and anywhere" Wheeling Pitt "shows up willing to reach an agreement that does not destroy our union, does not gut our insurance program ... and does not line the already overflowing pockets of the vultures who control Wheeling-Pittsburgh ..." When informed of the plans of Local 1375, Jim King said USWA Local 1104 in Lorain, Ohio, had raised more than $2,000 in a plant gate collection and would be sending people to the Holiday Solidarity Rally in Steubenville, Ohio on Sunday afternoon, Dec. 22. He added that the "partnership" agreements that the union had signed with several steelmakers "may have weakened our ability to fight back." King, who heads up the local's volunteer organizing committee, said the Wheeling-Pitt strike was a "very important strike" that the union "just had to win." Steve Hega, vice-president of Local 1187, told the World that although pensions were important, "the other points are just as important. We just couldn't accept their offer." Hega said Local 1187 pickets Wheeling-Pitt headquarters at least once a week. "We fill a bus and a couple of cars and go down there and hand out leaflets," Hega said. Last week the union decided to change its tactics and sent union members into the office demanding to see the annual stockholder report. "Every employee who owns even one share of stock has the right to see it. In fact, we each got a letter telling us of our right - only thing about it is that the print's so fine you can't hardly read it. But this year we got out a magnifying glass and read it." When 50 union members entered the company office building with the demand to see the books, they were threatened with arrest. "But they backed down and we looked at the books," Hega said, laughing. For Frank Ellis, president of the Ohio Valley Trades and Labor Assembly of Wheeling, W.Va., every union battle is everybody's fight. "We need solidarity - getting all unions together to fight back," he said. Then, pointing to the use of non-union labor by Wal-Mart, Sam's Club and Kroger to build a new shopping center on the Ohio side of the river, he said; "The battles at Wheeling-Pitt and to prevent use of scab are cut of the same cloth." According to the USWA, production costs at Wheeling-Pitt are about half that of other domestic steelmakers. During a normal production day, union members at Wheeling-Pitt ship 10,000 tons of steel to auto companies, heating and air conditioning manufacturers to producers of other steel products, including garbage cans. Union officials point out that even if Wheeling Pitt signs a contract bringing its workers' pension into line with the rest of the industry, it will remain more profitable that other companies. When the strike began, the company had a nest egg of more than $400 million. -Denise Winebrenner contributed to this story.

LOS ANGELES - The upset victory of Loretta Sanchez in California's 46th Congressional District has shaken the Republican Party establishment to its core. The defeat of nine-term Congressman Bob Dornan signals a historic turn away from right-wing politics in Orange County, a nationally-recognized citadel of conservatism. Sanchez, a Mexican American, becomes the first Latino and first woman elected to Congress from Orange County. The fact that she is the daughter of Mexican immigrants and trade unionists makes the victory against Dornan, who is viciously anti-woman, anti-immigrant and anti-labor, even sweeter. Sanchez was not intimidated by Dornan's tenure or his crass attacks against her. From the outset, she ran to win. A tactical decision to spend $100,000 for television and radio ads early in the campaign was successful in bringing in a flood of contributions and support. Her campaign for jobs, a woman's right to choose, affirmative action and gun control stood in stark contrast to the bombastic Bob, whose approval rating in the polls sunk to 40 percent. Ray Cordova, regional director of the Democratic Party in Orange County and a key figure in the Sanchez campaign, told the World that the Sanchez victory was due in the first place to a historic turnout by Mexican American and Latino voters. While over half the district is Latino, it has not been a decisive factor until now. Citizenship campaigns and voter registration drives were crucial to Sanchez' success. Cordova, who is also a leader in the Communication Workers of America, emphasized the "tremendous role played by labor" in the 46th CD, one of the seven targeted Southern California races. He described the grassroots organizing that took place during the campaign. Monday Night Football mobilizations took place at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hall in Santa Ana, the largest city in the district. Unionists - 300 strong - would meet to watch football, work on election mailings and posters and do whatever other work needed to be done for the candidates challenging the county's GOP. "The labor movement," Cordova said, "successfully adopted both the labor-to-labor and labor-to-neighbor strategies in the district." Sanchez also mobilized the traditionally conservative Vietnamese community and, to the surprise of many, won their support and votes. Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole won the county only narrowly although in the past Orange County residents have voted overwhelmingly Republican in the presidential election. The Sanchez campaign estimates that women voters turned out big for her. She also received the votes of many whites and Republicans. Dornan's brand of right-wing extremism turned off these Republican voters, especially pro-choice Republican women. Committees such as Republicans for Sanchez were organized for the election. Ellen Padberg, a Republican political consultant from Orange County, wrote in the L. A. Times, "It will be poetic justice when a Latina sends Dornan to the unemployment office. Loretta Sanchez has everything that Bob Dornan can't stand in women - brains, courage, integrity and tenacity. Republicans and Democrats, men and women across the country will all raise a toast to Sanchez. She busted the bully." Dornan has a history of slanderous attacks against his political opponents. While Democrats are his main target, when Dornan defeated Judy Ryan, a judge, in the 1992 Republican primary he used racist and sexist terms to refer to her supporters. In his early years, right-wing Hollywood figures such as Ronald Reagan, John Wayne and Bob Hope gave Dornan his springboard into politics. They considered him their "great right hope." He has been the leading voice in Congress for a military buildup, winning him the nickname of "B-1 Bob." He has received funds from right-wing groups throughout the country, at one time receiving more money than any other candidate for Congress. A long-time friend of George Bush, Dornan developed the "Moscow strategy" for the 1992 presidential race. This was a last-ditch effort to paint Bill Clinton as a "traitor" for having visited the Soviet Union as a tourist during the days of the Vietnam War. Dornan said Clinton "went to the enemy heartland under the shadow of the Kremlin to be used by enemy forces" so he could "lick the boots of the Communist killers." No other member of Congress has matched the venom spewed by Dornan. He has been a vile, publicity-seeking frontman for the ultra-right for all his 18 years in the House of Representatives. He was a harbinger of the ultra-right takeover of the Republican Party. Dornan represents the worst and most dangerous fascist forces in our country. For this reason many are celebrating his defeat. A number of other races in the 46th CD reflected the new political realities. The most important was the strong campaign run by Lou Correa, a Mexican American, who lost his bid for the 69th Assembly District by only several hundred votes. His grassroots campaign was supported by labor and helped mobilize many Latinos who provided the margin of victory for Sanchez. Nativo Lopez, a leader of Hermandad Mexicana, an immigrants rights organization, won against Christian Coalition politics for a seat on the Santa Ana School Board. At press time, Dornan was claiming that his loss was due to a massive case of "voter fraud" and the votes of non-citizens. As usual, he is stooping to the lowest common denominator to try to win. While all the votes are still not counted, most are and Sanchez is still winning by 600 votes. Dornan's time is up.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. NEW YORK - How can Michael Eisner, CEO of the Walt Disney Company, afford to pay himself $97,600 an hour? Easy. He contracts manufacturers who pay workers in Haiti who sew Pocahantas, Mickey Mouse and other Disney clothing for 28 cents an hour. Responding to this and many other abusive conditions prevalent in the factories where The Disney Company gets its clothing manufactured, some 200 persons demonstrated in front of the Disney Store in midtown Manhattan Dec. 14. The National Labor Committee, a non-profit human rights advocacy group which has exposed the link between U.S. multinationals and sweatshops around the world, organized the protest. Thousands of Christmas shoppers going into the store and passing by it were surprised to see protesters dressed up as Santa Claus, Mickey and Minnie Mouse and other Disney characters. Demonstrators passed out leaflets denouncing Disney's link to production shops with horrendous working conditions. Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, detailed the abuses in "An Open Letter to Walt Disney." He wrote the letter earlier this year after returning from Haiti where he witnessed the conditions under which Disney manufactures the clothing which carries its label. Disney has contracted L.V. Myles and H.H. Cutler, which in turn contract production to L.V. Myles, N.S. Mart, Classic and Gilanex in Haiti. In his letter Kernaghan states that N.S. Mart, located in the Sonapi Industrial Park, pays its workers 28 cents an hour. But to earn this a worker on the assembly line had to handle 375 Pocahantas shirts an hour. A week's salary was not enough to buy one of the shirts which sell at Wal-Mart for $10.97. At a secret meeting with Kernaghan, workers told him management screamed and threatened them and young women are subjected to sexual assault by management. Toilets are filthy and there are rats everywhere, including dead ones in the water tank. "Mickey's for Kids Stuff" is made at the Classic Apparel factory which is managed by John Paul Medina, a former member of the Fraph Death Squad which killed thousands of Haitians during the dictatorship. When President Jean-Bertrande Aristide raised the minimum wage, Medina responded by increasing the daily piece rate quota from 720 to 1,200 collars in eight hours. Working conditions at other factories visited by Kernaghan were just as miserable. There are no applicable labor codes and even being suspected of trying to organize to improve working conditions is enough to get anyone fired. Living conditions for the working class are deplorable. Since milk is too expensive, children are given sugar water. Parents are unable to afford medicines or meat for their children. Cough syrup costs a day's wage, $1.54, and a can of powdered milk $3.08. Since workers' neighborhoods do not have running water they must buy it by the bucket. A one-room shack may be home for an entire family, and often several families must share a hole in the ground as a toilet. Kernaghan's letter lists four proposals which the workers made to Disney: 1) that Disney send representatives to meet with them so that they may learn what their working and living conditions are. 2) help clean up the factories and guarantee respect for human rights including the right to organize. 3) an increase in wages to 58 cents an hour. 4) that local human rights organizations have access to the factories to monitor conditions as they do with factories contracted by the GAP. The demonstration in front of the Disney Store ended with a march up Fifth Avenue. Nick Unger from the Union of Needle, Industrial and Textile Employees told the crowd Disney had to be made responsible for the sweatshop conditions in Honduras, El Salvador, Haiti and New York.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. The poorest 4.5 billion people on Earth - 80 percent of itsinhabitants - together earn only a little more than half theamount earned from the sales made by the world's 200 largestcorporations. So says the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) inWashington, D.C., in its recent report, "The Top 200: The Rise ofGlobal Corporate Power." "Two hundred giant corporations, most of them larger than manynational economies, now control well over a quarter of theworld's economic activity," states the report written by SarahAnderson and John Cavanagh. "Philip Morris is larger than NewZealand and it operates in 170 countries ... The most alarmingfinding is that as corporate concentration has risen, corporateprofits have soared, yet workers and communities are getting ashrinking piece of the growing pie." The income of these corporations is growing both absolutely andas a proportion of the world's total Gross Domestic Product(GDP). In 1982 world GDP was $12.6 trillion, of which sales ofthe 200 equaled a bit less than a quarter. By 1995 world GDP haddoubled to $25.224 trillion; the sales of the top 200 hadincreased to more than 28 percent of world GDP. Japan and the United States accounted for 115 of the companies in1982 and 117 in 1995. In 1982 only 15 of them were headquarteredin Japan. Today, however, 58 are headquartered there and accountfor 39 percent of the 200's total sales while the 59 U.S. firmsgenerate only 28 percent of total sales. Six of the top 10 companies in terms of sales - but not corporateprofits - are based in Japan, three in the United States and onein South Korea. Ninety-three percent of the top 200 firms arebased in only seven countries - the United States, Japan,Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands andSwitzerland. The total sales of these corporations exceeded one-quarter of theworld's 1995 GDP. Only two developing countries, South Korea andBrazil, have firms in the top 200: Their six firms account forunder 2 percent of the 200's total sales. Of the 191 countries in the world in 1995 only 21 had economieswhich exceeded that of the largest corporation, Mitsubishi ofJapan. Mitsubishi had sales of $184.5 billion, more than the GDPof Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation. In theAmericas, only the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico andArgentina had GDPs greater than Mitsubishi's sales income. Infact, the income of each of the 20 largest global corporationsexceeded the GDP of every country in Latin America except Brazil,Mexico and Argentina. The 200 corporations represent but one half of one percent of the40,000 firms whose operations extend beyond the boundaries of thenations in which they are headquartered. These 40,000 firmsconduct their business through some 250,000 affiliates. Whencorporations establish branches in other countries to produceparts then sold back to the original firms - or to affiliates instill other countries - should this be considered trade?One-third of world trade is made of just such "sales andpurchases." Forty percent of Japanese exports are to otherbranches of the parent firms. If the leading corporations account for a quarter of the world'seconomic activity should they not also employ at least a quarterof the world's work force? That would total about 650 millionpeople, according to U.N. figures cited by IPS. Actually, theyemploy only about 18.8 million, less than one percent of thoseworkers. Only 118,000 people were employed in the 13 tradingfirms represented in the top 200. This "industry" had greater sales - $1.216 trillion in 1995 -than any other industry represented. Automobiles, the second mostprofitable industry, employed more than 2.876 million people.Three of the 15 auto companies were U.S. corporations: GeneralMotors, Ford and Chrysler, who employed 1.168 million betweenthem. GM, with 709,000 employees, is the largest employer in theentire group of corporations. Non-productive industry, i.e., the 63 trading, banking, insuranceand finance firms, accounted for some $2.490 trillion in 1995sales, 35 percent of the total sales of the 200, nearly 10percent of world GDP. Five trading companies generated 12 percentof the entire 200's sales - 3 percent of world GDP..Telecommunications alone now accounts for $289 billion in salesannually - 1 percent of the world's economy. But how much of that capital is available to the world's people?The poorest 85 percent of the world's population live incountries whose GDPs are less than $1,000 per person. Bycomparison, the GDP per person in the United States is around$25,000. There is much ballyhoo that this is the era of the "informationsuper highway." As we visit AT&T's and GTE's world-wide computerweb sites, we should remember that more than 90 percent of theworld's people do not have access to telephones. In the words ofthe IPS report, "the top 200 are creating a global apartheid, nota global village."

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. NEW YORK - Responding to outrage against Texaco'sracist job discrimination, the Rev. Jesse Jackson called Tuesday for an immediate boycott of goods and services sold by the giant oil company. Jackson announced the boycott after he and the Rev. Al Sharpton had lunch with Texaco Chief Executive Officer, Peter Bijur, at the company's headquarters in White Plains, New York. Jackson said Bijur refused to budge on the issue of job discrimination despite the furor over the release of a tape recording of a 1994 Texaco board meeting in which top executives referred to African American workers as "black jelly beans" who "stick to the bottom of the bag." They made demeaning comments about Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of lights, and Kwaanza, an African American holiday patterned after an African harvest festival. They went on to discuss shredding documents to conceal Texaco's record of discrimination in hiring and promotions from discovery in a $520 million discrimination lawsuit by the company's 1,400 minority workers. The tape recording was made by Richard A Lundwall, at the time senior coordinator for personnel services. He was later terminated when Texaco downsized. In revenge, he handed the tape over to attorneys representing the minority workers. "It will be cheaper to settle this suit than to prolong it," Jackson added. "It should have been the first item on his agenda." Asked by a reporter if the boycott is immediate, Jackson replied, "I hope when you leave here and you'll need gas, you'll see a Texaco station and go right by." Bijur decried the move. "Boycotts are divisive in my view, they cause economic disruption." William Taylor, president of Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Local 7-507 in Aurora, Illinois endorsed the Texaco boycott. "I've added Texaco to my list of companies not to patronize," he told the World in an interview. "A boycott can be very effective if it is properly organized. When enough people stop buying Texaco products the company will yield." Taylor's local represents hundreds of Amoco and Mobil oil workers while a Texas OCAW local represents many Texaco employees. "There's racism and discrimination in the boardrooms of all of these big corporations," he told the World. "Its the nature of the beast." Lundwall's tape is now being compared to the videotaped beating of Rodney King by seven Los Angeles police officers in 1991 which forced the issue of police brutality into the public eye. It is a smoking gun that exposes the big lie (spouted by GOP Presidential nominee Bob Dole and other right-wing demagogues in this year's election) that racial discrimination is ended and that the U.S. is a "color-blind" society. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert wrote on Nov. 11, "Even as the Texaco story was making its way around the country, voters in California were approving Proposition 209, a measure aimed at dismantling affirmative action programs. Who needs affirmative action when discrimination is a thing of the past?" he asked sarcastically. Herbert added, "Racial discrimination is as common as commercials on television. Employment discrimination is so widespread the agencies attempting to deal with it are overwhelmed. Most of it is ignored." Richard T. Seymour, director of the Employment Discrimination Project of the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in Washington, told the World, "The Texaco lawsuit makes the case very strongly that there is a need for continued affirmative action programs. It also shows that corporate executives need instruction in ethics." If the Texaco executives destroyed documents, Seymour added, "it is obstruction of justice and they should face criminal charges. They should be prosecuted." In cases in which evidence is destroyed, he added, "the judge has the option of declaring a very strong presumption that Texaco was guilty of discrimination." Seymour cited the case of Mitsubishi, found guilty of sexual harassment and sex discrimination at its auto assembly plant in Illinois. "The Mitsubishi case was a powerful indicator of the pervasiveness of sex discrimination that went all the way to the top of the corporate structure." The Texaco case, he said, promises to be equally sweeping in exposing the racist practices of a corporate giant with $36 billion in annual revenues and net profits last year of $607 million, up 33 percent from a year earlier. In a Nov. 5 letter to Bijur, H. Carl McCall, New York State Comptroller wrote: "I am profoundly dismayed by reports of Texaco executives planning to destroy documents relevant to a discrimination lawsuit and racial epithets to describe employees." He added, "I am the sole trustee of the New York State Common Retirement fund. The Fund owns over 1.2 million shares of Texaco with an estimated value of $114 million. "On behalf of the 880,000 retirees and active members of the Fund, I am greatly concerned that a corporate culture of disrespect and discrimination could have a negative impact on performance and value," said McCall, the first African American elected to state-wide office in New York. He demanded an end to these practices. "I eagerly await your reply," he added.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Chase Manhattan Bank and I have something in common. We both have an interest in the cost of living, with mine going back many years when I did the research for the Congress of Industrial Organizations showing that during World War II workers' living costs went up much more than the amount recognized in the official Consumer Price Index (CPI). A few years ago Kellner made a survey and found that the prices of products bought by the average family rose by about 12 percent a year. My survey - which I conducted at the local Shop-Rite - came to the same conclusion: Today I have to spend at least $20 for the same grocery items that I could get for between $14 and $17 less than a year ago. And now the CPI is under renewed challenge. For some years the Wall Street Journal has been carping about the index, claiming it exaggerates increases in living costs. And now Alan Greenspan, chair of the Federal Reserve Board and establishment guru on economic matters, has joined the hue and cry. According to him, the CPI overstates the rise by between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent per year and should be revised downward. And the pressure is building. A panel, headed by Michael J. Boskin, chief economist for President Bush, has "found," using "scientific studies," that the CPI overestimates living costs by as much as 2.0 percent per year. Most government officials who deal with the economy support the change - except for Katherine Graham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics who defends the existing index. But Democrats cannot be expected to offer serious opposition to demands for a downward revision of the CPI, as witnessed by New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's ardent support for such a revision. Nor has the labor movement yet rallied its numbers to oppose these revisions. Instead, if the editors of Business Week are correct, union spokespersons say only that the panel "exaggerates the CPI's errors." If Boskin & Co. are to be defeated, organized labor should do more than oppose any reduction, it should call for an upward revision of the index. But who cares whether the CPI goes up or down one or two percentage points? Does it make a real difference? And the answer is, "Yes, it makes a big difference - and workers will care plenty." Alan Abelson, a columnist for Barron's Weekly, let the cat out of the in bag on Dec. 2 when he said, tongue-in-cheek, that the Boskin Commission was inspired by a Congress that "desperately needs a way to take the knife to Social Security without inciting the rage of the nation's politically potent old coots. Increases in Social Security payments are tied to inflation as measured by the CPI. Ergo, fiddling with the CPI is a perfect (read "blameless") way of diddling the geezers." All federal social programs are linked to the CPI. Social Security payments will go up 2.9 percent in January because of the 2.9 percent increase in CPI. If the Boskin proposal to reduce the CPI were in effect, recipients would get only 1.9 percent more. (When added up over 10 years, that one percent would amount to a 10 percent cut the tenth year.) Similar downward adjustments in health and poverty programs would also be cumulative. Over a 10 year period, these adjustments would "save" the government $615 billion by taking the money out of the pockets of workers and their families. More billions would be taken by losses in benefits paid by state and city governments - and neither takes into account the disproportionate losses that would be borne by African Americans, Latinos and other racially- and nationally-oppressed minorities. But the impact of Boskin would not be limited to those dependent on governmental benefit programs. Millions of workers are covered by union contracts that are linked to the CPI. Were wage increases cut by 1 percent each year for 10 years it would cost workers $1,200 billion - bringing the total losses to nearly $2 trillion, with about a third coming from 18 million trade unionists. I said earlier there was need for an upward revision in the CPI because it understates the rise in living costs. Consider, for instance, taxes - federal, state and local - that are taking more and more of workers' wages. But taxes aren't included in the CPI. If they were, it would increase the CPI and its rate of acceleration significantly. And what about food, beginning with the fact that there has been a shift in consumption habits with millions of consumers recognizing that health and longevity require a reduction of the fat in their diet. As a result, there has been a shift away from eggs and red meat in favor of chicken and fish. The CPI for food consists of several components, among them "fresh fish" (price up 96 percent since the index was last adjusted in 1987) and "meat and eggs" (price up 40 percent) But price alone does not take into account the share that fish and seafood now represents when compared with the total for meat, fish and eggs which the CPI puts at 7 percent. My calculations show that fish now represents at least 10 percent of the total cost of meat, fish and eggs - a calculation more than substantiated by the line at the fish counter at Shop-Rite. Obviously, a correction here would be reflected in a higher CPI. And what about automobiles? The Cost of Living Index for motor vehicles shows an increase to 143.8 percent since 1982-84. But in the early 80s, the typical new car cost about $6-7,000. Today it is at least $14-15,000. What happened - and why? Each year the BLS index allows liberal allowances for "quality improvement," in the finished product - improvements vouched for by none less than the auto makers themselves! Thus, the automobile component of the CPI goes up only 44 percent - and Cost of Living Adjustment to wages for auto workers are reduced and an understated CPI denies millions of people justifiable increases. One could make similar calculations for medical care, and utilities, but these few examples typify the skullduggery. Nor does the skullduggery end there. The Census Bureau has already finagled the index enough to wipe out part of the recent decline in family incomes and now proposes applying the new, indexes retroactively so as to statistically eliminate the decline in real wages - as if workers don't know they are getting shafted no matter how the data are manipulated! The rationale I have seen for imposing the new criteria for CPI is that people are taking advantage of bargains. But there is no evidence that there are more bargains or that sales are more frequent than at other times - both factors that would have to exist for that argument to have merit. Capitalist enthusiasm for the proposed "reforms" stems from the fact that workers' losses due to the changed indexes will mean corresponding escalation of capitalist profits. And there can be no doubt that the reduced expenditures for public benefits will strengthen, perhaps decisively, the capitalist campaign for reduction of their taxes - especially for slashing or eliminating the tax on capital gains, the means by which more and more of their profits are generated.

The right-wing drive to seize control of the federal governmentby capturing the White House and strengthening their grip onCongress fell short on both counts Tuesday as voters gavePresident Clinton a new lease on the presidential mansion andsignificantly reduced the GOP majority in the House ofRepresentatives. The right wing took it on the chin in campaign after campaignacross the county: Paul Wellstone's rout of Rudy Boschwitz inMinnesota's senatorial contest, Cynthia McKinney's reelection toCongress in Georgia; the defeat in Illinois of Al Salvi, thedarling of the militia groups; the victory of Julia Carson, thefirst African American woman elected to Congress from Indiana.Voters returned all sitting Democratic members of the House. The string of GOP defeats continued with Carolyn McCarthy, theRepublican-turned-Democrat who boasted that she "defeated theNRA" in her upset victory of a GOP first-termer in New York;Dennis Kucinich, who overcame a vicious red-baiting attack todefeat Martin Hoke, Ohio's millionaire GOP congressman; and theelection of the nation's first-ever Chinese-American governor. And in all of them the AFL-CIO, with its nationally-coordinatedLabor '96 campaign, emerged as the driving force that set theparameters of the debate, be it for the presidency of the UnitedStates or seats on the Dade County School Board in Florida. Gary Cox, a key staff member in McKinney's Georgia office, saidthe contribution of the AFL-CIO to McKinney's "Street Heat Team"- a team of 100 union volunteers that began a door-to-door "getout the vote" drive early on election day - was "awesome. We hadan 80 percent turn-out in our targeted precincts." McKinney, forced to run in a newly-formed district because ofcourt-ordered redistricting, won reelection by a 58-42 majorityin a district that is only 30 percent African American. LynnWechsberg, who described herself as a "white, suburbanite soccergrandmother" and former activist in the New Jersey RepublicanParty, worked tirelessly in McKinney's campaign. "I have become more thoughtful," she said, adding that she was"particularly offended by the extreme, almost fanatical activityof the Christian Coalition in Georgia." Warren Gould called Labor '96 the first rung on the ladder forchange. The New Haven, Conn. Central Labor Council, of whichGould is president, played a decisive role in two congressionaldistricts targeted by Labor '96. "We defeated Gary Franks andincreased Samuel Gejdenson's margin of victory from fewer than 50votes in 1994 to more than 10 percent this year." Gould said the next step was to "assure that regular, everydayworking and unemployed people get the representation theydeserve. And that means continuing what we've begun by organizingthe unorganized." Charles Deppert, president of the Indiana AFL-CIO, agrees. "Wedeserve an "A" for effort but the labor movement has to grow ifit is to provide a voice for working people." Deppert said the Indianapolis labor council had a response teamof about 100 volunteers who canvassed Carson's district threetimes on election day. "This made it possible for Carson to winby 10,000 votes in a district that is only 27 percent Black. Bill Moore, communications director for the Minnesota AFL-CIO,called Sen. Wellstone's 52-to-41 win a "decisive victory" forgrassroots, door-to-door, one-on-one organizing. "We had morethan 2,000 people working the phones or ringing door bells." Moore said the state federation had been instrumental inincreasing the bloc of labor-endorsed members of the statelegislature. Moore added that, although the right wing had been"chastened," labor should have no illusions. "They are stillthere and we have to keep the heat on [and] we aren't giving ablank check to the Democratic Party." For Cindy Hall, president of the South Florida AFL-CIO, the Labor'96 campaign "helped us energize our members to deal with localelections as well." Hall, who is also legislative director for the teachers' union,said, "We endorsed candidates for eight of the positions on thenine-member board. We would have won all of them except for onecandidate who put $300,000 of her own money into her campaign ...she bought the election." The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that nearly $2billion was spent on the presidential and congressional races in1996, with corporations dishing out seven times as much money asthe $35 million spent by the AFL-CIO to finance Labor '96.

For subscriptioninformation seebelow. All rights reserved - may be used with PWWcredits. (Gus Hall is national chairman of the Communist Party USA. The following article is taken from his report to the CPUSA's national board Nov.23-24.) The activities, role, relations and achievements of the Party in the 96 elections call for a new estimate and a whole new concept of the Communist Party in our country. We need a revised concept of the Party in order to realistically set our sights, our goals, our plans for the post-election period. We should base it on all that is new, emerging and developing in the Party, within the framework of a new situation in the country and in the class struggle. Otherwise, we will not see, and therefore not realize, the vast new potential in just about every area of life and struggle, especially in our working and fraternal relations with the trade union movement, the AFL-CIO, but just as important the individual unions, their leadership and rank and file. Our mass relations are on a new level. We are in the process of building a mass Communist Party. New developments, especially as a result of the elections, add new dimensions to our consideration of a new mass party, especially the much greater possibilities of recruiting workers, trade unionists and mass leaders. Perhaps the most exciting and most potentially explosive developments are the responses to our People's Weekly World events by unions, leaders and activists and to our electoral role. These are very much interconnected. Our electoral policy - especially our emphasis on the lesser evil approach and our singular contribution in educating, agitating and organizing against the fascist danger - greatly enhanced the respect of the trade union movement for our Party and opened up doors to winning workers and trade unionists to our politics and ideology. Our trade union relations are on a new level. The electoral work of our our state organizations, especially in working with labor to defeat the ultra-right candidates, has gained the Party broader acceptance and influence. Some have won new respect in helping to build electoral coalitions. Some have achieved new mutually beneficial working relationships with local, city and state labor bodies, trade union activists and leaders. The base of support of many of our state and district organizations has significantly widened among all sectors of the people. Our efforts in building support of the Martinez public works jobs bill, especially on the West Coast and in the trade union movement, has also raised our standing. In the post-election period this movement has the makings of a successful national, mass campaign. We will have a special meeting on the bill to discuss its status and lay plans for our role in helping to build a nationwide movement that unites labor and people's movement in support of massive jobs legislation. The impending cuts in welfare, that will throw millions of poor and oppressed peoples and especially disabled and poor children into deeper destitution and despair, are fast becoming an emergency crisis. The special racist and anti-children impact, the anti-immigration attacks and the workfare issue make the creation of millions of new, public works jobs an emergency, immediate priority. Parallel with this struggle, we must also help build a movement to compel Clinton to keep his promise to review and work to undo the damage of the Republican welfare bill he signed. The ultra-right danger has been blunted. This is a tremendous achievement. The American people have rejected the Contract on America. The Republican Party, calling for "cooperation" instead of "confrontation," is sounding more and more like phony liberals trying desperately to change its image because of the elections. They know they cannot return to the new Congress displaying the same reactionary bluster, arrogance and pushing openly anti-people policies. But everything has changed. The trade union movement will never be the same. The communities of the racially and nationally oppressed will never be the same. The mass movements will never be the same. All labor and people's forces are in a new, more powerful position. The challenge now is to build on these changes and to continue moving in a positive direction to win new victories and further defeat the ultra-right in the New Year. In light of our new achievements, to enable us to grow and to deepen our unique contributions to the class struggle and mass movements, I propose we adopt five main challenges for the immediate period ahead. 1. We have to grow In many ways the biggest challenge is how to continue to recruit, how to make winning people to our Party a part of our everyday activities. And, how to consolidate all the new members. The main approach to consolidation must be how to activate new members. The challenge is how to involve new members in mass struggles and actions, how to draw them out, onto picketlines, to distribute our newspaper on the streets, to hold forums that are relevant to their lives and, especially, conduct social affairs that will bring people out and together. Club meetings should be a part of the activating process, but not the only approach. By now experience has proven that invitations to meetings alone are doomed to failure. Consolidation and activization should be a single process. We cannot consolidate without activating new members. 2. Winning workers The base of our Party is, and must be, industrial workers. Recruiting and consolidating workers cannot be achieved in the same way as mass, street recruiting. It is different and in some ways more difficult. Thus, the second challenge we face is the re-establishment of our policy of industrial concentration. This must include regular distribution of the People's Weekly World at shopgates, the regular publication of special, industrial issues of the paper, the publication of regular shop papers. It includes drawing up district and club industrial concentration plans of work. 3. The Party and labor The third challenge is how we can be more helpful in helping the trade union movement with its new challenges and problems. For example, while there is some successful organizing of the unorganized, the majority of the working class remains unorganized. At the same time, the basic corporate policy remains the destruction of the trade unions. The corporations are especially committed to this goal because they are well aware that they will be forced to deal with a new, class struggle oriented trade union movement. We have to play a role in helping to build labor's political independence. The potential is now tremendous. However, it is problematic whether the Labor Party can play a leading role in establishing labor's political independence in light of their non-involvement during the presidential elections. We should work to convince the Labor Party that their policy is wrong and help move them into electoral activities, if possible. Without some basic changes, the labor movement will not accept the Labor Party as a viable channel for labor's political independence. We have to continue the correct tactic of building the united front that we pursued during the election campaign. The differences that mainly dissipated should not be the basis for post-election differences. In fact, one of our immediate tasks should be to build unity with all progressive political forces. Everything is different now. We must reach out, seek for common ground and build unity in struggle with all forces, including those we may have had differences with during the election period. That is over now. There is a new situation. Post-election tactics must be based on unity in struggle. This should include post-election unity of the trade union movement; post election unity in the area of independent political action; post-election unity in the struggle against racism, against chauvinism; post-election unity in the struggles of the unemployed and the homeless; post-election unity in building a movement to win the Martinez Public Works legislation; post-election unity in the struggles against privatization to save public education and the environment. We also face a challenge in building on the higher level of working relations we have developed especially with trade union forces, but also with many communities and people's organizations. There is a new openness, a new willingness to work openly with, accept and respect Communists as part of coalitions, alliances and campaigns. 4. Renewed struggle vs. racism A fourth challenge is to find ways to stimulate and activate the struggle against racism. We have to find ways to refresh, replace and restore the affirmative action programs that have been destroyed and play a role in the fight against the implementation of proposition 209 in California. In the struggle against racism, we have to intensify the struggle against police brutality, criminalization and the horrendous, racist cuts in welfare programs, at the same time fighting for jobs, not workfare. We have to play a leading role in the struggle against the vicious, chauvinist, racist and anti-immigrant campaigns raging in many states. We have to take on the new level of anti-Semitism, especially in New York. We have to convince and help the trade union movement become a more effective, powerful instrument in the struggle against racism, especially in the shops. We must raise the level of educational work within the Party as part of the struggle against racism, chauvinism and anti-Semitism. 5. Financial questions In order to continue and increase our role and work, to build the Party and the movements, we have to accept a fifth main challenge - to change our attitude toward party finances. Most wrong attitudes are fed by a main misconception that there are really no limits to our funds. Therefore, at times we make political decisions without any consideration about whether we can afford to carry them out. Making politically correct decisions does not mean our decisions are financially correct. As a result of this discussion we must make concrete plans for a new advanced gift and wills campaign and a whole new set of attitudes toward our overall finances and building our "advanced gift" funds. We are now in a position to set the stage for a successful campaign and to show potential contributors and investors that we have proven our ability to invest and secure their money in accord with their wishes and needs, and at the same time to benefit the Party and the paper. Based on our great achievements, I am confident that we can meet all the challenges. I am confident that we can and will make all the adjustments and changes necessary to accomplish everything we set out to do in the coming post-election period.

GusHall, national chairman of the CPUSA, stated "By announcing that he will signthis bill, President Clinton is making a serious election miscalculation. Theultra-right, Republican bill will push millions more into poverty and death.Which makes defeating the facist-like Republican Congressional majority evenmore a life-and-death issue." The CPUSA agreed with the many labor, religious and people's organizationswho have said millions more children will suffer because of this bill. Itwill have a racist and anti-immigrant impact, affecting African Americans andLatinos disproportionately. This bill will affect negatively all workingclass people, whether you are on welfare or not. Cutting food stamps, alone,affects all in the food industry - from farmers to food processors togrocers. While cutting the lifeline for millions of families, why isn't Congresstaking action to cut corporate welfare? Corporations are the biggest welfarecheats by getting tax cuts and government subsidies in the billions. TheCPUSA asserted that $104.3 billion is spent on corporate welfare, $619billion on the military, while only 14.4 billion is spent on social welfare. "To end welfare as we know it" means to pass a comprehensive jobs bill.America needs legislation that will create jobs at union wages with benefitsand affirmative action guidelines. There is much work to be done building andrebuilding roads, bridges, schools hospitals, parks, homes and cleaning theenvironment. Pass the Martinez Public Works Jobs Bill, H.R. 1591, a billwhich is gaining broad support among labor and elected officials. The CPUSAis working to defeat the Dole, Gingrich "gang of 73" in order to turn ourcountry around.

NEW YORK - Calling public education a "cornerstone of our democraticstructure," the Communist Party USA held an emergency meeting here Saturday,Sept. 21 to map out a plan of action to save our schools. CPUSA Vice-Chair Sam Webb, in his opening remarks, said, "Up until now, wehave assumed that the public education system is untouchable. But theAmerican people can no longer afford to think that way. A section of theruling class is ready to scrap our system of public education with the sameruthlessness that it closes factories, lays off masses of workers, and writesoff formerly thriving cities as bad investments." Conference participants, including teachers, parents, students and tradeunionists from 10 east coast and Midwest states, denounced vouchers, "choice"and charter schools, which coupled with cutbacks in government aid foreducation, would cripple public education. Webb said, "We should rejectfor-profit schools in any form. Children must not be turned into commodities.Corporations will not solve the education crisis any more than they havesolved the crisis of joblessness." The conference, which issued a six-point plan of action to defend publiceducation and preserve democracy, the most immediate task being the defeat ofDole, Gingrich and the 73 ultra-right House Republicans on Nov. 5. Webb said, "Getting rid of them would go a long way toward getting rid of the"whiff of fascism" in the country. The rest of the CPUSA program includes: No to privatization schemes in any form. Organize unity coalitions of parents, schoolworkers, students and electedofficials to speak out and defend public education including ads in papers,press conferences, letters to the editors, and visits to legislators'offices. Cut class size to 15 as the first step in school reform. Hire teachers andsupport personnel using affirmative action guidelines. End the use of local property taxes for school funding. Tax the rich andcorporations to pay for quality desegregated education. Reappropriatemilitary expenditures into the Department of Education. Pass the Martinez public works jobs bill (HR-1591) which would appropriate$250 billion, much of it to build new schools and repair old ones.

As the elections approach, the fire bombings have escalated. Itcalls for the broadest urgent fightback response from the anti-racistmajority of the American people. Newt Gingrich, Jesse Helms and other right-wing extremist politicians inWashington have created the atmosphere for these hate crimes. There are dailyracist attacks on affirmative action and welfare. There is open instigationto racist violence by talk-radio hatemongers like Bob Grant. There are theSupreme Court rulings overturning majority Black and Latino congressionaldistricts. The evidence is incontestable. Their aim is to roll back all the gains of theCivil Rights movement and the New Deal and to terrorize and divide thegrowing unity of Black, Brown and white people. It's an attempt to blunt theresurgent AFL-CIO and the historic alliance between African American churchesand the labor movement. Look at what life was lost from other hate crimes. Remember the bombing ofthe Oklahoma City federal building in which 168 men, women and children ofall races and backgrounds died. The federal government and law enforcement agencies have failed to vigorouslyinvestigate and apprehend the perpetrators of these vile firebombings.Instead, federal agents have often treated the victims of the crime as ifthey were the perpetrators, interrogating the pastors and grilling churchmembers to the point of tears. Adding insult to injury, the FBI and JusticeDepartment has openly questioned whether the church firebombings are a"conspiracy." We say: There are none so blind as those who will not see! All who oppose racism should take initiative to demand government action tohalt the burnings. The time is now to build all people's unity to defeat theforces of racist terrorism and violence. White supremacist groups like the KuKlux Klan must be outlawed. All who cherish democracy must act now. Everyone, every religiousdenomination, every labor union, every civil rights and communityorganization should demand that the federal government act now to protectthese churches. The answer to these hate crimes is greater unity and action to defend AfricanAmerican churches everywhere. And registering millions to vote and defeat theultra-right in November gives a most resounding answer to crimes of hate.

Communist Party National Chairman, Gus Hall, branded the Republican nationalconvention "a scripted extravaganza of demagogy that raises the level of theultra right danger and the stakes in the 1996 elections." The Communist leader termed the convention "a corporate financed andchoreographed spectacle in which every tightly controlled speech was steepedin hypocrisy with the aim of hoodwinking the millions of voters watching theshow on TV." Hall said attempts of the convention managers "to show inclusionand diversity" came through "as total demagogy, considering the extremelyracist and anti-immigrant positions of the Republican platform." He predicted, "thecrude efforts to narrow the gender gap by highlighting a few women speakerswill fail to convince the mass of women who know the Republican anti-labor,anti-people record." Hall said that the smoke and mirrors convention recalled "the beginning offascism in Germany when Adolf Hitler's party called itself the 'GermanNational Socialist Party' with the sole aim of throwing people off guard. Andit worked -- for a while." He cautioned that "we must not allow theexteme right forces in our country to portray themselves as the party thatwill restore the American Dream when they are in fact promoting an Americannightmare." On the positive side Hall added, "This speaks volumes about thedemocratic sentiments of the American people. The convention handlers feltcompelled to ban the words "Contract with America" and the candidatesdistanced themselves from the platform, because the American people have rejected thosepositions." "But the danger is great," he went on. President Clinton'sstatement earlier that he would sign the Republican, anti-people welfare billwas grist to the Republican mill. "That and the announcement of a Dole-Kemp ticket gave newenergy to the Republicans," he said. "It is already changing the electoralpicture and it will boost the sagging fortunes of the Gingrich Gang of 73,the rich Republican right-wing businessmen and the religious right whoare out to destroy the economic and democratic rights of the people. Thedeceptive tactics displayed at their convention should serve as a wake-upcall to step up voter registration and education campaigns. The stakes havenever been greater."

The fight for it hasdeep, anti-racist and democratic roots in our country." Hall went on: "BobDole's acceptance speech singled out the teachers' unions for special attackand said that he is a firm supporter of school choice and vouchers." Hall characterized the attack, along with Dole's tax cut for the rich and thecorporations as "a new and dangerous element to the campaign of theultra-right" to completely dismantle the public education system in ourcountry. He warned "Don't forget: Gingrich tried to do away with theDepartment of Education." "The corporations and the ultra-right have pushed for defunding,privatization, vouchers and every other scheme to eliminate what the majorityof Americans see as a basic right, free, integrated, quality publiceducation." Hall continued: "Unity of all - with teachers, parents, studentsand school workers - unity - between Black, brown, red and white - unity withthe labor movement and community is key to defeating the Dole, Gingrich,Kemp, corporate attack." The conference will be held September 21 in New York City. It will bringtogether teachers, other school workers, parents, students, professors andall grassroots trade unionists and activists concerned about public schoolsand universities. A comprehensive program of action will be drafted. For moreinformation call (212) 989-4994.

"The outcome of the '96 presidential and congressionalelections will have a most profound impact on U.S. politics, on the people'soverall quality of life and the future direction of our country," Hall said.Pointing out the dangers if the ultra-right Republicans recapture theCongress and continue their Contract with America, Hall said, "The electionresults can actually mean the difference between life and death for millions.It will mean the difference between hunger and food stamps, between morelayoffs, joblessness and the Martinez jobs bill (HR1591), between publiceducation and no education, between union rights and union-busting. Who getselected can mean the difference between welfare and immigration laws that arehumane and just, or policies that are anti-people and racist."In a biting criticism of the media Hall said, "The campaigns and mass mediaare out to blur the issues, trivialize them and keep people from discussing,debating and making the right choices." That is why Hall and the Communist Party USA are urging a massive voter turnout on November 5. Emphasizing some of the most important arguments forpeople to vote, Hall warned that if ultra-right candidates win, thereactionary and fascist-like corporate sectors will become more aggressiveand emboldened in their attacks on the quality of life and democratic rightsof the people. Struggles will continue after the elections no matter who iselected, Hall said, but "a Gingrich-led Congress will take no heed ofprotests, demonstrations or people's pressure. The base of support for theright-wingers are the most reactionary, extreme right sectors of monopolycapital, the ruling class, the wealthy, the religious right and militiafascist-fringe forces." Playing its part in voter mobilization, the Communist Party has registeredthousands of new voters and distributed hundreds of thousands of electionpamphlets as well as the CPUSA's newspaper the People's Weekly World.

These are recommended titles from your local booksellers . . . Good Reads are the books we want to tell you about. Good Reads are the books we are most passionate about. Because there's more to reading than bestsellers . . . . SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS David Guterson (Vintage $12.00) The Buzz among independents for this Good Read began in 1994, when booksellers were first introduced to this compelling story of a Pacific Northwest fishing town's reaction to its Japanese-American citizens at the outbreal of WWII and a murder trial following the war that lays bare old wounds. Independent bookstores love discovering a gem like Snow Falling on Cedars and sharing their enthusiasm, with customers, and they've done it with these other featured titles. EMERALD CITY Jennifer Egan (Doubleday $22.50) With Invisible Circus and now this collection of sensitive, sophisticated novellas, Jennifer Egan is a young writer to watch. She has a unique voice and her coming-of-age stories are peopled with a wonderful variety of characters. --Janet Boreta, Orinda Books, Orinda THE VANISHED CHILD Sarah Smith (Ballantine $5.95) This little-known, compelling novel is not only a great read, its the best selling book in our store's history, It has outsold John Grisham, Anne Rice, Sue Grafton . . . just read the first page. --Christy Pascoe, A Clean Well Lighted Place for Books, San Francisco VERONICA Nicholas Christopher (Dial Press $22.95) This is a novel that perhaps only a poet could write. Christopher orchestrates his characters through a mysterious, magical Manhattan with the studied knowledge that in the end, as in the beginning, he is working with symbols in a fictional world where anything is possible. The reader cannot but help but be seduced by his power as a storyteller. --Jeff Johnson, GAIA Bookstore & Community Center, Berkeley AN ANTHROPOLIGIST ON MARS Oliver Sacks (Vintage $13.00) In seven true tales, Dr. Sacks continues his exploration of human beings with neurological disorders, offering case histories that read like novellas. The joy of this compassionate work is that we are made to see the person and not the disorder. While these are "deeply altered selves," they are also extraordinary doors to alternate ways of perceiving the self." --Amy Thomas, Pegasus Books, Berkeley ATTICUS Ron Hansen (Harper Collins $22.00) Atticus goes to Mexico to recover the body of his dead son, and is compelled to investigate the circumstances of his son's suicide. Hansen (author of Mariette in Ecstacy) weaves a story that is both an intriguing mystery and a moving portrayal of a father's love. --Kara Jernstrom, Bookshop Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz THE FLYING DRAGON ROOM Audrey Wood, illustrated by Mark Teague (Blue Sky Press $14.95) With her magical prose, Wood explores a young boy's imagination. Using a magic toolbox, he creates a world where wild animals are friendly, a bubble machine works continuously, and extinct dinosaurs come to life. This book helps calm the night time fears of a young child afraid to go to sleep. --Kathleen Caldwell, Bonanza Street Books, Walnut Creek THE MAN OF THE HOUSE Stephen McCauley (Simon & Schuster $22.00) A laugh-out-loud funny look at the ties that bind family and friends. The humor stems from McCauley's sharp social and psychological observations of the human foible and its many forms. --David Sjostedt, Copperfield's Books, Sebastopol AT NCIBA MEMBER STORES, YOU'LL FIND . . . .

Two cozy book-lined rooms, including a real nook are furnished with wingback chairs, reading lamps, and tables. The store stocks new and used mysteries, true crime, spy thrillers and children's books. Other bookcases contain old collectible books and mystery puzzles and games. The antique furniture and lace curtains at the windows add to the charm of this unusual store which resides in a 90-year-old farm house. Though a business (and one of two bookstores in town) - the building still retains the cozy feel of home, especially when rain strikes the tin roof. Crooks 'n' Nooks was begun when owners Diane Christensen and Sharon Martin met singing in the church choir. Christensen had always been interested in books (with a particular passion for mysteries), and Martin had always wanted to open a gift shop. They combined their talents and cemented their partnership by attending the American Booksellers Association school for booksellers. Christensen and Martin opened Crooks 'n' Nooks in June, 1993. As both women work full-time, Christensen as a librarian in Sacramento County and Martin for the California Youth Authority, their husbands - both Steves - help tend shop during the week. Martin describes Crooks 'n' Nooks inventory as an "eclectic mix." The store carries the range of mystery and detective fiction, "everyone from Tony Hillerman to Dick Francis." However, Crooks 'n' Nooks specializes in female mystery writers such as Marcia Muller, Elizabeth George and P.D. James. "There just happen to be so many wonderful female mystery writers - and Elizabeth George is our favorite," raved the bookseller. The store also stocks gifts and collectables, some of them mystery related. Among the more unusual items available at Crooks 'n' Nooks are mystery jigsaw puzzles. Individuals have to complete the puzzle in order to solve the mystery. Another unusual gift item is a party game called "Pasta, Passion and Pistols." Intended to be acted out over dinner, "the game even includes recipes," notes Martin. The store also carries fantasy and children's books - especially series such as the wildly popular Goosebumps,as well as the Boxcar Children, Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books. Combining store specialities is a series by the English writer Enid Blyton which are mysteries for children. One of Crooks 'n' Nooks distinguishing features is Bentley, a life-size wooden butler dressed according to season. Bently greets customers with his tray of "Mostly Murder" newsletters. Depending on the weather, Bently may be found on the front porch or inside the shop. And depending on the season, Bently has been known to sport a Halloween cape and mask, Christmas cap or even a springtime garland. Crooks 'n' Nooks prides itself on "the personal touch." The store provides customers with help in finding books, and it is not unusual for individuals to receive a phone call letting them know a book they might enjoy has arrived. The store hosts occassional author readings and signings. Other special events sponsored by the Crooks 'n' Nooks have included mystery weekends at a local bed & breakfast, and mystery dinners involving a local winery and theater group.

AUTHOR SAYS "THANK YOU" Boston author Sarah Smith (pictured holding book) paid a visit to A Clean Well-Lighted Place for Books in San Francisco to celebrate the publication of her novel "The Knowledge of Water" (Ballantine). A period mystery, the book takes place in the Paris of 1910, when a torrential flood ravages the city. The San Francisco store created a special window display around the book utilizing a 3-D puzzle of the Eiffel Tower. Pictured with the author is bookseller Christy Pascoe, whose enthuisiastic handselling of Smith's earlier paperback, "The Vanished Child" (Ballantine), made industry news last year. Pascoe and A Clean Well-Lighted Place have sold nearly 3000 copies of "The Vanished Child," making it the bestselling book in the store's history. BOOKSELLERS RAISE FUNDS FOR LITERACY A group of independent bookstores in Santa Cruz County recently presented a check for $350.00 to the Literacy Program of the Santa Cruz Volunteer Center. The check was presented by Lee Duffus, owner of Bookworks in Aptos, at a ceremony held at the Santa Cruz City-County Public Library. The money had been raised at "Word by Word," a literary event sponsored by area booksellers during National Independent Bookstore Week. The theme of this year's NIBW was "Building Community Foundations." Participating bookstores included Bookworks and Mockingbird Books in Aptos; Village Book Cafe in Scotts Valley; Avalon Visions, Capitola Book Cafe and Seeds of Change in Capitola; and Bookshop Santa Cruz, Herland Book Cafe, The Literary Guillotine, Sleepy Dragon Book Bistro, Gateway Book and Gift, Logos Books and Records, Westside Stories, Treasures of the Heart and Zamzam in Santa Cruz. MARIN BOOKSTORE HELPS CRACK THEFT RING Book Passage in Corte Madera was involved in a sting operation that led to the arrests of a bookstore owner and an alleged supplier of stolen books. According to published reports, police say the two suspects have been part of a stolen book ring operating in the Bay Area for 10 years. After suffering substantial shoplifting losses, Book Passage hired an undercover police officer to moniter the store. The off-duty officer caught a shoplifter who provided information pointing toward a book theft ring. The Corte Madera and San Francisco police departments then launched a criminal investigation using books supplied by the Corte Madera store. Police eventually arrested two men after one was allegedly observed selling stolen books to the other. Investigators recovered numerous boxes of books they suspected were stolen, including the books provided by Book Passage. TWO STORES CELEBRATE BIG "TWO-O" Two NCIBA member stores celebrating their 20th anniversaries are Bookworks in Aptos and The Booksmith in San Francisco. Bookworks celebrated two decades in business on September 20th by serving customers slices of cake and discounting merchandise an approprate 20 percent. The Bookworks' celebration continues through the end of the year on the 20th of each month (sans cake) with special sales and drawings for free books and gift certificates. And in San Francisco, The Booksmith celebrated its 20th anniversary on October 20th. A Haight Ashbury fixture, The Booksmith had a sale as well as hosting approximately 20 authors on the day of its anniversary celebration. Bay Area authors Ron Hansen, Ginu Kumani, Joel Selvin and others were on hand helping The Booksmith celebrate while "working" various sections of the store. OVERHEARD IN THE AISLES Overheard in the drama section of the Alexander Book Company in downtown San Francisco: "Oh, I just love Checkov - don't you?" "Ya, he was ok in Star Trek - but I haven't read his book."

PIERPONT MORGAN LIBRARY EXHIBIT ON VIEW A selection of masterpieces from the The Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City - including numerous literary manuscripts and books - is currently on display at the M.H. DeYoung Museum in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park (through April 27th). Masterpieces from Library includes ancient Near Eastern cylinder seals, medieval and renaissance illuminated manuscripts, early printed books and bindings, old master drawings, authors' and composers' original manuscripts, and Americana. Highlights include a mid-l0th-century Spanish manuscript, the earliest illustrated copy of Beatus's commentary on the Apocalypse; one of the 11 extant vellum copies of the Gutenberg Bible (ca. 1455); original manuscripts by Byron, Charlotte Bront�, Charles Dickens, Henry David Thoreau and Mark Twain; and drawings by such artists/writers as William Blake, John Ruskin, William Morris and Beatrix Potter. The exhibit represents the most comprehensive selection from the Library's holdings to travel in 40 years, and presents a magnificent survey of the artistic, literary, and musical achievements of Western civilization from ancient to modern times. For more information on the DeYoung exhibit, visit their website at http://wwwfamsf.org/legion/exhibition/morgan/index.html. PLANS SET FOR NATIONAL POETRY MONTH The Academy of American Poets has announced plans for the second annual National Poetry Month, to take place in April of this year. Among the scheduled events is a Tax Day celebration of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land ("April is the cruelest month . . . ."). The Acedemy will join with publisher Harcourt Brace to commemorate the poem's 75th anniversary by distributing thousands of free copies of a special edition of the poem at post offices all over the country. The Academy will also work with the American Booksellers Association, the American Library Association, and other institutions to mount an ambitious program that will include a poetry website, readings at more than 30 major public libraries across the country, a special Poets Laureate reading at the Library of Congress, and the distribution of 180,000 posters to bookstores, libraries and schools. Among the featured items at the website (http://www.poets.org) will be a chat room, a listing of prominent poetry awards and winners and links to related sites. National Poetry Month made its debut in 1996, when organizers say more than 4,000 schools, libraries, bookstores and community centers participated with readings, contests, projects and displays. The month was officially recognized by President Clinton, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other officials across the nation. ASTRONAUT LOVES BOOKSTORES One of the things astronaut Shannon Lucid missed most while living on the Russian space station Mir was browsing through bookstores. Upon her return, the bookloving extra-terrestrial made up for lost time. ``We landed on a Thursday, didn't we? I was in the bookstore on Saturday,'' Lucid is reported to have said. BAY AREA LOVES INDEPENDENTS An informal survey of book consumers conducted at the San Francisco Bay Area Book Festival underscores the vitality of independent bookselling in Northern California. The survey asked, in part, where consumers bought books (independent bookstores or national chains) and what they liked best about buying from their preferred store. Independents were the primary source for 85% of the respondents, while 13% favored chains and 2% chose both options. Additionally, 60% of the consumers who preferred independents said that their bookstore has recommended a book to them, while the chain store recommended percentage was less than 10%. Most of those who completed the survey had special ordered a book and were pleased with the service provided. When asked what they liked best about their preferred store, respondents who favored chain stores answered selection - 29%, price - 22% and convenient location - 12%. Respondents who favored independent bookstores answered selection - 45%, knowledge of books - 15%, support of local businesses - 13%, service - 12%, ambience/atmosphere - 12%, staff - 10%, and friendly people - 10%. GRAHAM SWIFT WINS BOOKER PRIZE Graham Swift won the 1996 Booker Prize for his comic novel, Last Orders. The prize was established in 1968 and honors the best novel written in English in Britian or one of its Commonwealth nations. The author, a 47-year old Londoner, collected a check for $32,000 at a ceremony to honor the winner. Last Orders tells the story of four people who meet to carry out the dying wish of their friend, who asked that his ashes be scattered into the sea off the county of Kent. The chairman of the Booker judges noted that "Choosing the winner was torture, but we finally settled on Last Orders, a wonderful book that will give great pleasure to thousands of people." For a list of previous winners, please refer to the NCIBA Booker Award page. POLISH POET WINS NOBEL PRIZE Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, described as ``the Mozart of poetry,'' won the 1996 Nobel Prize in literature. Szymborska, 73, lives in the Polish city of Krakow. Her work has appeared frequently in the New Yorker, and she was the inspiration for the movie ``Red.'' Critics have described her as being both deeply political and witty at the same time. Her verse is marked by high seriousness, delightful inventiveness, a prodigal imagination, and enormous technical skill. Szymborska is regarded as one of the best representitives of Polish poetry since the second World War. The Nobel citation describes her as ``the Mozart of poetry, not without justice in view of her wealth of inspiration and the veritable ease with which her words seem to fall into place.'' Her most recent book is 1993's ``The End and the Beginning,'' not yet translated into English. Works available in English include ``View With a Grain of Sand'' (Harcourt, Brace) ``People on a Bridge'' (Dufour) and ``Sounds, Feelings, Thoughts: Seventy Poems'' (Princeton). For further information, please refer to the Press Release from the Nobel Prize Foundation.

NCIBA CO-PUBLISHES REGIONAL BOOKSTORE GUIDE The Northern California Independent Booksellers Association - in association with Heydey Books - has published a guide to independent bookstores across Northern California. First & Foremost: A Guide to Northern California's Independent Bookstores, authored by local writer Charlene Akers, highlights more than 300 stores. As every reader and browser knows, bookstores are not only a source for books - but, as often the centers of their neighborhood or community, for information and entertainment. The book, which retails for $12.95, can be found in bookstores throughout the region. Ask your local bookseller how you can get a copy. WEB SITE OFFERS INDEPENDENT RECOMMENDATIONS Former bookseller Joan Call has launched The Independent Reader, a World Wide Web site offering book recommendations from 13 independent bookstores around the country. Each of the participating stores submits a recomendation in five different categories: new fiction, new non-fiction, softcover fiction, softcover non-fiction, and mysteries. The site then gathers the listings from each bookstore while adding extra information from publishers and building links to related internet sites. A sixth listing for a wildcard selection can also be found at The Independent Reader. Web surfers can view the recommended titles by store or by category, as well as print out a combined list of all recommended books. The site also includes a miniature home page for each bookstore detailing the store's philosophy, community involvement and current and past recommendations. Participating NCIBA stores are Cody's Books in Berkeley and A Clean Well-Lighted Place for Books in San Francisco. Other independent stores from around the country who are also featured on the site are Powell's Books in Portland, Oregon; Elliott Bay Books in Seattle; Tattered Cover in Denver; Prairie Lights in Iowa City; Women & Children First in Chicago; Hungry Mind in St. Paul; That Bookstore in Blytheville, Arkansas; Talking Leaves Books in Buffalo, New York; Partners & Crime in New York City; Bunch of Grapes Bookstore in Martha's Vineyard; and Harvard Book Store in Cambridge. NCIBA ISSUES REGIONAL BOOKSTORE DIRECTORIES The Northern California Independent Booksellers Association announced the release of five new regional directories to bookstores across Northern California. The full-color brochures include maps and detailed listings of more than 300 NCIBA member stores throughout San Francisco, the East Bay, the North Bay and North Coast, the South Bay and South Coast, and the Central Valley, Gold Country and Sierras. The NCIBA hopes the brochures will give consumers the opportunity to discover the vitality and diversity of independent bookstores. The brochures will be distributed to bookstores, libraries, chambers of commerce, hotel lobbies, bed and breakfasts and elsewhere. Ask your local bookseller how you can get a copy. FTC DROPS PROBE OF PUBLISHER DEALS WITH BOOKSTORES The Federal Trade Commission has dropped its eight-year investigation into allegations that major publishing companies discriminated against independent booksellers by giving discounts to major bookstore chains. The FTC said the industry has changed so dramatically since 1988 - in part to private settlements between independents and publishing companies - that the investigation was no longer worth the time and expense.

Censors have been trying to ban books with unorthodox or unpopular points-of-view since at least 387 B.C. Even books like dictionaries, textbooks, travel guides and the Bible have been banned. Censors have attacked everything from the plays of William Shakespeare to the novels of Mark Twain. If every book that anyone found objectionable were banned, there would be no books left. Books are sometimes censored because of a single word or because the cover suggests a subject matter offensive to someone, even if that person has not read the book. (Some do judge a book by its cover.) Censors have also targetted all works by an author after reading only one. Every year, hundreds of books are challenged and banned in libraries and schools all over the world. In the United States, censorship incidents have been documented in every state, including California. At the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, we think books are a great way to learn about many issues - things we sometimes have a hard time talking about. Not everyone will agree on everything, but if we read, reason and think, books will help us to a better future. Reading is not just a privilege in this country, it's a right. Let's keep it that way. If you think there is room for more than one opinion . . . you're right ! At the NCIBA, we maintain an active vigil in defense of free speech. We believe the free exchange of ideas cannot be taken for granted. Free speech is as intrinsic to a democratic society as it is to our own livelihoods. Members of the NCIBA have testified before the State Assembly in Sacramento regarding free speech issues, and we have joined with concerned parties in other industries in voicing our concern over threatening legislation. When the Board of Education removed short stories by Alice Walker and Annie Dillard from statewide tests for 10th graders, the NCIBA coordinated a joint effort with publishers to place copies of those author's books in every high school library in the State of California. Our member stores have also led local campaigns in their own cities and neighborhoods to raise awareness around censorship concerns. We believe free speech cannot be taken for granted. A shortlist of books challenged in California during the last five years * House of the Spirits, by Isabel Allende ---retained in the Paso Robles High School despite objections to accounts of sexual encounters and violence Clan of the Cave Bear, by Jean Auel ---challenged, but retained from the Moorpark High School recommended reading list in Simi Valley despite objections that it contains "hardcore graphic sexual content" We All Fall Down, by Robert Cormier ---pulled out of elementary and junior high school libraries in Stockton after parents complained that it glorifies alcoholism and violence, contains a rape scene and its characters use too much profanity Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley ---challenged as required reading in the Corona-Norco Unified School District because it is "centered around negative activity." The book was retained and teachers selected alternatives if students object to Huxley's novel The Giver, by Lois Lowry ---temporarily banned from classes by the Bonita Unified School District in La Verne and San Dimas after four parents complained that violent and sexual passages were inappropriate for children Thousand Pieces of Gold, by Ruthanne Lum McCunn ---rejected as an addition to a core literature list by the Amador County Unified School District because "it makes America look bad" * source: American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression Freedom of speech is the foundation of bookselling in the United States. Without the First Admendment, publishers are not free to choose which books to publish, booksellers are not free to choose which books to order, display and sell, and readers are not free to decide which books they wish to read. Without freedom of speech, not only books but the very commerce of ideas would be stifled. In this American election year, its especially important to cast your vote for free speech on-line and in print ! Free speech links: The NCIBA suggests concerned individuals stay on top of the issues. One excellent source of information is the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression page on the internet devoted to free speech news.

CALIFORNIA LITERATURE California's rich literary history makes for great reading - as do the works of the many authors who currently live and write in the Golden State. Residents of California are blessed not just with a rich literature of their own - but with the opportunity to often see and hear writers who may well be their neighbors. California's many independent bookstores act as a link in the chain of literature: independent bookstores host readings with local authors; stock titles from regional presses; and maintain sections devoted to local interests and writers. NCIBA bookstores - which are locally owned and operated - bring writers and readers together. The literature of California begins with the Native American oral traditions and the earliest printed material of the Spanish and Mexican periods. Since then, a great body of work - novels, stories, poems, plays, essays, memoirs, histories and much else - has grown out the state's often tumultous history. Through the early adventure stories of Jack London through the Depression-era novels of John Steinbeck till the jazz-inspired poetry of the Beats until today's multicultural writers - California has contributed not only to the literature of the United States but to the world. Be sure and visit your local library or bookstore - where books by California authors or books on California subjects may be found. Also, please visit the NCIBA page on California Literature, where you can find out more about the state's abundant literary history, including: A BRIEF HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA LITERATURE NOTABLE BOOKS WITH CALIFORNIA SETTINGS SIGNIFICANT CALIFORNIA WRITERS before 1900 1900 through 1950 1950 through the present LITERARY AWARDS and PRIZES Looking for something good to read?

CALIFORNIA BOOK AWARDS NCIBA Great Reads Award NATIONAL PRIZES Pulitzer Prize National Book Award INTERNATIONAL AWARDS Nobel Prize in Literature Booker Prize MYSTERY AWARDS Edgar Award POETRY AWARDS Recent American Poetry Awards SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY AWARDS Hugo Award Nebula Award CHILDREN'S BOOK AWARDS Caldecott Medal Newberry Medal CALIFORNIA LITERARY TRIVIA The name "California" is derived from an old Spanish novel, "Las Sergas de Esplandian" ("The Exploits of Esplandian"). Written about 1500 by Garci Ordonez de Montalvo, the book contains several fanciful references to an island called California populated by Amazons. The early European explorers who ventured into the region undoubtably had this place-name in mind when they first described the State. The first book in English to be printed in California was written by a Pole naturalized as an American citizen, Felix Paul Wierzbicki. The book was "California As It Is, And As It May Be" (1849). Robert Frost - best known as a poet of New England life, was born in San Francisco in 1874. During Hollywood's early days, the Belgian playwright and Nobel Prizewinner Maurice Maeterlinck, who spoke no English, was hired to adapt his novel La vie des abeilles for film. However, when the screenplay was translated, movie moguls were shocked to find the hero was a bee, the producers not knowing what the word abeille meant. "They Knew What They Wanted" (1924), a play by Sidney Howard, was the first work by a Californian to win the Pulitzer Prize. John Steinbeck is the only Californian to have won both the Pulitzer Prize (fiction, 1940) and Nobel Prize (literature, 1962). Other California winners of the Pulitzer Prize include William Saroyan (drama, 1940), Upton Sinclair (fiction, 1943), George Oppen (poetry, 1969), Wallace Stegner (fiction, 1973), Gary Snyder (poetry, 1974) and Alice Walker (fiction, 1984). San Francisco's City Lights Bookstore, co-founded by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti in June 1953, was the nation's first all paperback bookstore. Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980, has lived and taught in Berkeley since the early 1960's. Some of the many non-California writers who have lived and worked in the state for considerable periods of time include Mark Twain, Henryk Sienkiewicz, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Thomas Mann, Aldous Huxley, Bertolt Brecht, Christopher Isherwood, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Berkeley poet Robert Hass was the first California writer to be named Poet Laureate of the United States (1995). To find online information about literature, please visit our page of Literary Links.

With over 600 members, including more than 300 booksellers, the NCIBA has been an experienced provider of services for over two decades. Organized as a mutual benefit non-profit corporation, the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association is led by a 15-person Board of Directors that includes four Officers and two associate representitives from the publishing community. Officers serve two-year terms, while Board members are elected for one to three years, with elections held each spring. The NCIBA also employs an Executive Director and an Associate Director while maintaining offices in Corte Madera, California. To find out more about the NCIBA, please refer to our F.A.Q. page (frequently asked questions) and the NCIBA Declaration of Independents. The NCIBA Board of Directors NCIBA committees Contact and office information Northern California bookstore sales The NCIBA conducts many projects and activities for its members. We are a proactive organization. Here is a brief description of some of what we offer. WHAT WE DO CALIFORNIA TRADE SHOW This three-day annual event, currently held the first weekend of October (Friday- Sunday) brings together over 1000 booksellers from Northern and Southern California, Nevada, and Arizona with publishers, authors and other members of the book community. Show activities include exhibits representing over 500 publishers and other book-related vendors, numerous education workshops, our annual membership meeting, author breakfasts, plus author readings and autographings.This event is not open to the public. Pre-registration is encouraged. Show admission is free to all NCIBA members and their employees. Day-long educational programming for booksellers is offered by the NCIBA on Friday, which is also the set-up day for exhibitors. We also host a social gathering in the evening. Exhibit days are Saturday and Sunday, with publishers displaying new and backlist titles, taking orders, offering show specials, and meeting with customers new and old. For booksellers, there are also a full slate of educational workshops to choose from as well as a schedule of over 80 authors signing books over the course of both days. The Saturday breakfast features authors of adult books, while Sunday's is devoted to children's authors. HOLIDAY BOOK CATALOG Our California Catalog features adult and children's titles in a beautifully designed full color format. This holiday book catalog, with a print run of nearly 1.5 million, is inserted in key media throughout the state and available to member bookstores in bulk quantities, with every store receiving 100 copies free. The books appearing in the catalog are the result of the NCIBA's best efforts to solicit titles of interest to customers of independent bookstores. As such, the California Catalog has proved to be very popular with customers and an effective holiday sales tool for our members. EDUCATION PROGRAMS The NCIBA produces annual spring workshops, a daylong program that includes a variety of concurrent sessions dealing with topics of concern to our members. Our regional gatherings send a contingent of Board members out of the immediate Bay Area to meet with booksellers in a specific region in order to get feedback and discuss issues with members whose geography makes direct access more difficult. PROMOTIONS The NCIBA's Good Reads advertising campaign features periodic full-page ads in the San Francisco Chronicle Book Review section. The ads feature bookseller reviews of distinctive titles, and serve to generate sales and to distinguish independent bookstores in the marketplace. Full color regional membership brochures are distributed in stores and high-traffic locations throughout the state. In the Fall of 1996, Heyday Books and the NCIBA co-published a guidebook, "First and Foremost: A Guide to Northern California Independent Bookstores." This book is available at independent bookstores across the state. The California Independent Booksellers Great Reads Book Awards honor exceptional titles, voted upon annually by member booksellers. The awards are publicized through store posters and media attention, reinforcing independents' link with quality writing. MEMBER PUBLICATIONS Our monthly newsletter disseminates association news, reports on bookstore activities and industry issues, and prints a monthly independent Bestseller List. It's also used to distribute media reprints and material produced for in-store displays. The California Rep directory, a guide to area sales reps, is updated and distributed every January. WHO MAY JOIN Membership is limited to those "in the trade." Regular voting membership is open to any individual member of the retail bookselling community whose primary place of business is California. Each company is entitled to one voting member. Membership dues for each voting member are $50.00 per year, and runs April 1 through March 31 (we do not prorate). We also welcome associate members, who while not entitled to vote, are vital to our community and its dialogue and receive all other benefits of membership. Associate members may include prospective booksellers, publishers, sales reps, wholesalers, members of the media, librarians, authors or illustrators and sideline/service/supply vendors. Dues for associate members are also $50.00. Both regular and associate members may choose to designate other persons within the organization to receive mailings from the NCIBA (newsletter, events announcements, etc...). These additional members may be added at any time, at $25.00 per person. Membership entitles you to free admission to our Trade Show, reduced rates at educational programs, participation in member services programs, subscription to our newsletter "NCIBA News," one free copy of the annual Rep Guide, one free copy of the Membership Directory, appropriate inclusion on our web site and many other benefits.

The Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, or NCIBA, is a trade organization dedicated to supporting, nurturing and promoting independent retail bookselling. With hundreds of member stores in just about every community in Northern California (from Arcata in the north to Monterey in the South), the NCIBA has been an experienced provider of services for over two decades. What kind of bookstores are independent bookstores ? All kinds ! Our diversity is our strength. Our membership includes general interest bookstores as well as specialty shops. Children's, travel, mystery, science fiction, antiquarian, used and even museum bookstores belong to the NCIBA. Some stores are as small as 100 square feet, some as large as 33,000 square feet. What matters is not the size of the store or the volume of business, but our dedication to quality service, community involvement and most importantly - books. "Independent" seems to be a defining characteristic of your organization. What's the difference between an independent bookstore and a chain bookstore ? Have you ever walked into a chain bookstore and asked for the Pulitzer Prize winning novel Shipping News, and been told they don't carry that magazine. Or have you asked for Lolita, and been refered to the Amy Fischer story ? As more and more people are discovering, the so-called "super" stores are not really all that "super." In fact, many of the leading chain bookstores have begun to model their business operations after independent stores. However, without the dedication of knowledgeable and experienced employees, of community involvement and responsiveness, and of our own love of books and enthuisiasm for sharing our passion - chain bookstores are not all they appear to be. Independent bookstores stand for something different - and we believe, something better. What exactly does the NCIBA do ? Among our many projects is the California Catalog, a holiday catalog distributed throughout California. The books appearing in this catalog are the result of the NCIBA's best efforts in soliciting titles of interest to customers of independent bookstores. With its 1.5 million print run, full color format and popularity with consumers, the California Catalog has proven to be the leading holiday book catalog in the state. One recent project is First and Foremost: A Guide to Northern California Independent Bookstores. This comprehensive guide - co-published with Heydey Books - is essential reading for any book or bookstore lover. Another recent project includes five regional directories to independent bookstores throughout Northern California. These full color brochures feature maps and a listing of the best bookstores throughout the East Bay, San Francisco, North Bay & North Coast, South Bay & South Coast, and the Central Valley, Gold Country and Sierras. These brochures can be found in bookstores, hotel lobbies, chambers of commerce, bed & breakfasts and other high traffic locations throughout the region. Each month, the NCIBA issues a regional best-seller list published in alternative newspapers such as the East Bay Express and the Sacramento News & Review. This list differs from other bestseller lists and reflects what is really selling in independent bookstores in Northern California. The NCIBA is also the source of the popular " Good Reads" ads found in the San Francisco Chronicle and elsewhere. These ads feature bookseller reviews of distinctive titles - the kind we love to tell our customers about. Adjunct to the "Good Reads" campaign is the "Great Reads Book Award," which honors exceptional books and is voted upon annually by member bookstores. Besides these activities, the NCIBA also sponsors an annual trade show and educational workshops as well as producing a monthly newsletter and a California rep directory geared toward those in the retail bookselling community. Can I join the NCIBA ? Membership is limited to those "in the trade." Regular membership is open to any individual member of the retail bookselling community whose primary place of business is California. We also welcome associate members, who while not entitled to vote, are vital to our community and its dialogue and receive all other benefits of membership.
