Let the experts tell you what works! John Hummer, "We look for the following in a company:" Market place the company is going after Management - they don't have to have done this before to succeed The technology itself. Alan Koenigsberg, "Although we looked at many venture capitalists for funding, we decided to self-fund." He admits it's a difficult route but he is proud of his accomplishments, which include comprehensive on-line service to the food service industry. Peter Ling helps companies set a successful path, regardless of funding needs. He provides the management and structure to help assure a prosperous future. Dean Gloster, "We deal with many clients, anyone investing in the early stage of the company invests in the Idea, but they are actually investing in the entrepreneur himself. Patterns don't apply to everyone and you have to be flexible." Companies need to be able to communicate quickly what the product is and how it will help the consumer. Catch this show on...

HistoryThe Fitzroy Legal Service opened in December 1972. It was oneof the first services of its kind in Australia. At that timethe main formal sources of legal aid were: The Legal Aid Committee (which then had only a city office). The Committee handled mainly civil cases plus criminal casesat a Magistrates' Court level. It appointed private solicitors(who were paid 80% of normal fees). Clients were usually requiredto pay a contribution, often by instalments. A "charge" over property was often required; and The Public Solicitor who assisted persons in criminal mattersin the County and Supreme Courts. Subsequently in 1973 the Australian Legal Aid Office opened. Its aims were to (a) assist those who have a problem involvinga Federal law; and (b) assist pensioners, people receiving SocialSecurity Benefits, migrants, Aborigines, ex-servicemen and somestudents. In December 1978 an Act of Parliament was passed allowing forthe establishment of the Legal Aid Commission in Victoria. Sucha Commission was intended to be an independent corporation determiningpolicy and funding levels for all legal aid organisations in Victoriaexcept the Aboriginal Legal Service. The Commission was fullyoperational by the end of 1980. Constitution The Fitzroy Legal Service is an independent organisation governedby its members through 4 General Meetings per year. Members ofthe community and clients are encouraged to participate. Fundingis received from the Australian Government Attorney-General'sDepartment via the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria. Contributionsfor its operations have also been received in the past from catchmentarea councils, and more recently from various government departmentsand Trusts for specific projects. The FLS is not an instrumentof government or municipal bodies. Legal Service Objectives The Service's objectives are - to provide a free and readily accessible legal service to people in necessitous circumstances and who qualify under the Service's eligibility criteria, and who live, work or study in the catchment area and to such other persons as the Service may from time to time decide; to seek guidance and direction on policy and its development from the community; to involve local citizens in the recognition, understanding and solution of their own legal and related problems; to establish programmes of preventative law; to provide legal education in the community; and to initiate and participate in law reform programs. and in implementing such goals priority be given to - innovative service delivery; and analysis and criticism of government, the legal professionand social structure. Operation In endeavouring to provide an accessible legal service to peoplewithout means the Service is - free; a storefront location in the suburbs where people live; operates at night so that those who cannot take time off work can consult us; informal, in that we seek to avoid an inhibiting atmosphere by taking a more personal and human approach; and holistic in its approach to people and their problems, by not focusing solely on legal solutions. The legal service also participates in and promotes law reformas well as promoting community legal education which is closelybound up with the practice of preventative law, demystificationand empowerment. Clients are seen from 6.30pm to 9.00pm Monday to Friday - at whichtime no appointment is necessary. Legal advice IS NOT GIVEN OVERTHE TELEPHONE. However, assistance is often given by telephoneto social workers and people in other helping agencies (includingmany government officers who seek advice on behalf of their clients). During the day the casework solicitors only see clients by appointment(usually after they have been seen at night). However, emergencysituations are handled wherever possible. Client Volume Since opening in 1972, the Fitzroy Legal Service has seen over50,000 different people. New clients are seen at the rate ofapproximately 80 per week. Total interviews, including peoplewho call a second or third time, amount to substantially morethan the number of client files opened. Client Groups Strict geographical limitations were introduced in November 1978in order to try and manage the workload. People who live outsidethe inner suburban area are encouraged to see a legal servicecloser to their local area. Referrals are made where possible. There are now over 40 odd Community Legal Centres in Victoria,including specialist Centres. A large proportion of legal service clients live in rented premisesor are boarders. Approximately 40% of the catchment area populationconsists of persons from non-English speaking backgrounds. Asubstantial proportion are unemployed or receiving pensions orbenefits and make up the overwhelming proportion of service users. Interpreters Wherever possible Fitzroy Legal Service tries to arrange for volunteerinterpreters in numerous community languages, to be availableon particular nights. Failing this, use is made of the free emergencyTelephone Interpreter Service, or if a specific grant has beenreceived from the Legal Aid Commission arrangements can be madefor an interpreter to attend. Community Legal Centres do not have access tothe Legal InterpretingService which creates great difficulties for a large proportionof agency users who come from non-English speaking backgrounds. Types of Problems The main areas in which assistance is sought are in criminal matters,family law, motor vehicle accidents, consumer problems, debts,housing, employment and miscellaneous areas including wills, immigration,social security payments, as well as complaints against police,solicitors, governments, etc. Casework ServicesIn a majority of cases we take some form of action such as writingletters, making investigations, using the telephone to negotiateand make demands. We also prepare documents and take other actionwhich includes completing forms and applications, attending policestations or other premises. Representation in court can be organisedif the client cannot genuinely afford legal costs and there areno avenues of assistance open. Court proceedings are issuedor defended in appropriate cases. These include cases where particularinjustices or hardships would otherwise result and where otheravenues of legal aid will not assist. In many cases the Service refers clients to private solicitors,appropriate social welfare agencies and/or the Legal Aid Commission. Representation is also arranged for clients in a range of Tribunals Means Test No formal means test is applied. Where representation in courtis sought the decision is made on the basis of client need. Inmany cases advice is given to people who would not normally qualifyfor legal aid on the grounds that it seems quite wrong for someoneto pay to find out information. Law Reform and Community Legal EducationThe Fitzroy Legal Service engages in a broad range of activitiesrelated to community legal education, law reform and general issuesregarding legal aid. One of its major projects has been the annual production andpublishing of The Law Handbook - a 780page book settingout areas of law commonly encountered at the Legal Service. Thebook has a practical orientation and uses relatively simple language. The publication was first published in the format of a looseleaf binder entitled "The Legal Resources Book" whichwas first released in 1977 and now is in a bound book format entitled"The Law Handbook", which was first released in 1987and is updated and distributed on an annual basis. (See On-lineCatalogue) Legal Service staff are involved in writing submissions andspeaking at a range of venues. The Legal Service has been involvedin committees engaged in work on consumer credit, housing associations,welfare rights, community legal education, Children's Court, multilingualpamphlets, the Beach Inquiry, Cost of Justice Inquiry, the NationalLegal Aid Advisory Committee, numerous Federation of VictorianCommunity Legal Centres Work Groups and many other community basedorganisations. Media activity has been considerable over the years, the principleendeavour being to improve the knowledge about the functioningof the law and seeking law reform. The Legal Service Bulletin(now called The Alternative Law Journal) which was an early projectof FLS is now a self-supporting national periodical which dealswith legal aid and related issues. Legal Service staff appearregularly on radio. The frequent role of the FLS in the early days was in advisingand supporting others wishing to establish legal services notonly in Victoria but also interstate. In addition to individualclients the Fitzroy Legal Service advises community, ethnic andsimilar organisations. The Legal Service has also been involved in a number of innovativeprograms which include outreach law programs at the neighbourhoodlevel within the catchment area which endeavour to deal with caseworklaw, community legal education and social action, and workingon issues affecting a given neighbourhood. Alphaline -a 24 hour emergency free legal advice line for young peoplein trouble with the police, and publications such as WhereYou Stand - a life rights publication for young people, TheWhere You Stand Teachers Kit, The Activists Rights Handbook,Legal Aid One Law for You, Another For Me, The Reportinto Mistreatment by Police in 1991-2, and until recentlythe Youth Advocates Guide and the Drug and Alcohol UsersGuide - a guide to detoxification and rehabilitation agenciesin Victoria for which we have lost funding, are also publishedby the Legal Service. The Fitzroy Legal Service also conducts and assists in theconduct of research into aspects of legal aid and welfare generally. Extensive statistical information has been collected in the pastin an endeavour to increase knowledge of client needs. The FLScontinues to maintain client statistics which are generally takenby the lawyer during the course of the interview, and are an importantlobbying tool for legal centres in general. Staff There are currently approximately 150 volunteers contributingto the operations of the FLS, through various committees, workgroupsand by staffing the evening service. There are approximately60 lawyers (barristers and solicitors) and non-legal volunteerson a roster who attend one evening every week.

The Fitzroy Legal Service PHILOSOPHY People have potential and they can develop greater power andcontrol over their own lives. The Legal Service should operate as a medium of changeby improving people's level of knowledge and their ability tocope, by changing laws and by raising the level of enforceabilityof rights. The Legal Service should give people access to the law. The positive expression of this philosophy can be made evidentin the attitudes and conduct of members by: Breaking down the mystique of the law and the formality ofthe solicitor/client relationship through a personal approach. Making a conscious effort to communicate with clients in away they can understand. Seeking wherever possible to do more than advise and refer. This involves not only taking appropriate action but also lookingbeyond the immediate problem with a view to: ascertain the causes; prevent future problems of that nature; being aware of and using the resources of the community; giving accurate and competent advice; and accepting responsibility towards clients and fellow workersby attending promptly and regularly.

On The AustralianLaw Reform Commissions Discussion Paper 59 13th July, 1995 The Federation of Community Legal Centres Victoria P.O. Box 1139K GPO Melbourne 3000 Victoria Australia Tel: 61 03 9602 4949 Fax: 61 03 9602 4948 Disclaimer:The Views Expressed in this paper may or may not be supportedby the Fitzroy Legal Service. Inference as to the degree of supportor otherwise as offered by the Fitzroy Legal Service as an organizationor its staff or volunteers should not be drawn. The Federation is the representative body for 43 specialist andgeneralist legal centres around the state of Victoria and so reflectsa wide community perspective. Accordingly, the Federation hopesthat you will give the issues raised in this Submission due consideration. This letter forms a summary of the Federation's views with respectonly to the key points of the Australian Law Reforms DiscussionPaper 59, May 1995. 1.The Federation agrees with the Commission's view on the problemsin the culture of agencies in relation to FOI applications. Itagrees with Proposal 3.4 that efficient and effective compliancewith the FOI Act should be incorporated into notions of publicservice best practice. As an example, we note that in Victoria,in a recent FOI application by the Western Suburbs Legal Servicebefore the AAT for access to police files, police handed overonly 33 files but admitted while giving evidence that there werein fact a total of 143 relevant documents which had not been disclosed.The Federation views such reluctance on the part of agencies asan impediment to good and accountable government. 2.The Federation supports recommendation 3.4 that there be a pro-disclosureinterpretation of the Act. The encouragement of greater publicparticipation in government and government accountability shouldalso be part of the interpretation of the Act. MONITOR 3.The Federation agrees that an independent monitor be establishedto monitor and oversee the Act, however we note that if this monitordoes not have some effective power to direct agencies then his/herconclusions can be disregarded by the relevant agency. To merelyincorporate a pro-disclosure clause in the Act will not of itselfchange that culture of agencies that the Commission refers to.In other words we believe that a monitor who merely mediates willnot necessarily have the necessary clout to deal with reluctantagencies. We believe that given the recognized need to reducedelays, costs and obstacles to the free flow of information thenthe intermediary steps by a monitor to free up access prior toa review by the AAT will assist in this and could even obviatethe need for AAT review in specific cases. The Federation believes that of the options contained in the Commission'sdiscussion paper on whom should be monitor, the Ombudsman wouldbe an appropriate person to carry out the monitor's role. Thereshould be increased powers to direct agencies with regard to disclosure.One suggestion is that the Ombudsman after appraising the situationalong the lines of 3.16 and 4.17( in that the Ombudsman may suggestways in which the workload could be reduced for the agency, narrowingthe applicant's application, or assist in communications betweenthe parties) could direct an agency. If the agency failed to respondto the Ombudsman's direction, the Ombudsman could direct the matterto the AAT. If the Ombudsman were found to be correct by the AATthen some form of disciplinary action against the agency couldoccur. This would perhaps lead agencies to be more responsiveand accountable. The Federation notes that the other structuressuggested for monitoring may create a position of conflict. Therole can only be performed by a separate statutory office. 5. It is the Federation's view that agencies should be penalizedfor a failure to meet deadlines however, at this time we haveno firm view on the form the penalties should take. 6.The Federation agrees with proposals 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13. Anagency itself should not decide whether it refuses a request onthe grounds that the work involved would substantially and unreasonablydivert resources of the agency. This works against the pro-disclosureidea and means the applicant must take the extra step of applyingfor a review bringing about further delay and cost. If consultationcan occur with the independent monitor in the first instance,then assumedly the request can be balanced and examined in animpartial and less self -interested fashion with the agency havingto justify why non-disclosure is appropriate. EXEMPTIONS 7.The Federation is in agreement with the introduction of apublic interest criteria in relation to all the exemptions underthe FOI Act however, the Federation is of the view that the clausedoes not go far enough. In recent times, Victorians have witnessedthe shift of traditional government functions into the privatesector. This means that access to information is severely limitedand reduces the ability for public scrutiny and open government.It is the Federation's view that areas that directly relate tocommunity services and are in the traditional government domainshould be subject to public record. Public funds are being usedto put these items out for private tender however, the exact termsof such negotiations are not subject to FOI as they are undercover of commercial transactions. In summary, the Federation isof the view that those who contract with government for the performanceof services which relate to the public interest should be subjectto FOI( this issue will be discussed at length later). 8.The Federation is of the view that conclusive certificate provisionswithin the Act are often abused. It feels that their use is toowidespread. It seems pointless that the AAT can review the useof concurrent certificates but cannot have them revoked. We agreethat at the very least the independent monitor should take noteson the relevant ministers and the amount of certificates theyissue and report to parliament. The Federation believes that theuse of such certificates should be tightened up to prevent currentabuse of process. 9.The clarification of the position of cabinet documents doesseem desirable and we agree that protection should not extendto documents merely submitted to cabinet. Further, we agree ExecutiveCouncil documents should not be protected. We see no reason why purely statistical information should beexcluded from disclosure (proposal 6.11) 10. In relation to the Law Enforcement and Public Safety issuecontained in paragraph 6.13 the Federation believes that policeand other law enforcement agencies should also be accountableand agree that a public interest criteria is appropriate. It hasconcerns about the type of restrictions in relation to policedocuments discussed. Subsection 37(1)(c) which exempts documentswhich may endanger a person is understandable as is the argumentdisclosure may prejudice law enforcement, however, we are concernedabout the application of such arguments where there are ulteriormotives for non- disclosure which conflict with the public interest.In Victoria, the Task Force Victor Report which was commissionedto look into policing practice after a number of police shootings( 22 since 1988) noted that military style tactics were beingused to deal with civilian problems. As stated earlier a numberof documents relevant to the proceeding and of crucial importancein securing police force accountability were not disclosed asthey could have proved embarrassing. Although this situation occurredin Victoria similar concerns could arise at a national level. 11.The secrecy provisions of s.38 run counter to the intendedspirit of the Act and should either be removed or restricted.Also, the non review of the Schedule 3 means that potential accesshas been denied without consideration as was intended at theAct's inception. Accordingly, the Commission should err on theside of access and the schedule should be deleted unless someonecan submit good reason for the retention of specific classifications. 12.The exemption of commercial activities of agencies appearsto the Federation to provide an effective way for government toavoid exposure of material through FOI, therefore, we see no reasonfor the extension of such a clause and agree it should be subjectto a balancing public interest test where government informationis concerned. 13. The Federation view as to disclosure of information by theprivate sector is addressed in paragraphs 7, 20 and 21 of thisletter. The transparency of government action by reason of privatesector dealing is an issue that the Federation is very concernedabout and goes to the very core of democracy. To argue that theinformation is already available to skilled authorities chargedwith guarding the public interest is a huge assumption and atbest naive. 14. The Federation sees no reason to exclude parliamentary departmentsfrom the definition of 'prescribed authority ' within the Actand so agrees with the Commission. COST OF ACCESS 15. The cost of access to FOI is of concern to the Federationwhose clientele is often at the front-line of individual hardshipor community action in the public interest. It is the Federation'sview, contrary to the submission referred to in paragraph 7.4, that information is not a commodity to be paid for like any other,in the context of FOI. The claim for access to information oftenheavily attaches to some right which without the access to informationcannot be realized. Whilst recognizing the cost to the agencies,the Federation believes there is little incentive for agenciesto curb costs. The Federation agrees fees and charges can havea deterrent effect on applicants. Individual access to personalinformation should be free as it is important for individualsto be able to check the information for accuracy or use them ina range of contexts e.g. medically, court procedures etc. Agencies should not be able to charge for the time taken in deliberatingon compliance with the request. This would seem to go againstthe whole pro-disclosure provision outlined in the Commission'srecommendations 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4.and would present a furtherbarrier to access to the process by increased charges. In addition,the Federation believes that the issue of charging for time spentin processing applications needs careful consideration as someagencies may take more time in processing than others due to poormanagement- this cost should not be born by the applicant. Rather,the internal procedures of the agencies in the processing of FOI'sshould be streamlined. The Federation agrees that the lowest possiblerates for photocopying and inspection should apply. The Federation agrees with the Commission in that financial hardshipand public interest need to be taken into account when chargingfor an application and that fees could be remitted, waived, orreduced. However, we do not agree that the decision in this regardshould be left to the agency concerned as we see a potential forconflict arising. For example, where the information requestedmay lead to court action the agency may be tempted to charge foraccess and thereby provide a barr to those suffering from hardship. The Federation suggests that the better option would be that wherea person claims financial hardship or where there is a publicinterest claimed, the independent monitor should make the determination.This would be consistent with the other proposals of the Commissionin relation to opening communication lines, the public interesttest criteria, agency culture and making access easier. The cost of the monitor should not be borne by the agency( althoughpenalties raised by fines against recalcitrant agencies couldbe used in this way). The monitor must be wholly independentfinancially from the agencies in order to do the job withimpartiality. It is suggested that the monitor could be fundedin a similar fashion to the Ombudsman i.e from general Commonwealthrevenue. AMMENDMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 17. The Federation believes that the process for amending personalinformation is cumbersome and needs simplifying. The Federationis unsure about the proposal that FOI and Privacy provisionsbe contained in the same act. It sees that there may be difficultiesin reconciling the two concepts. It agrees that amendment shouldbe available where the information collected is being used forunrelated purposes to the collection. The Federation is not thoroughlyconvinced by the solution provided by the Commission with respectto Proposal 8.5 as to keeping deleted material in a separate filebut recognizes the need for balance between the historical recordand the potential misuse of incorrect information by agencies.However, the Federation believes no scope for misuse should beallowed if it can be avoided. With respect to section 55(6) the Federation acknowledges thereis a problem that needs resolution. It notes that there is animportant issue at stake between the question of accuracy of informationand the standing of opinion. REVIEW MECHANISMS 18. The Federation agrees that internal review should not be apre-requisite to external review and that applicants should notbe charged for the internal review. It finds the submissions ofthe Departments of Defense, Housing etc underline the issue asto the culture of agencies in response to disclosure e.g.. thestatement that it is 'necessary to discourage persons seekingreview as a matter of course' goes against the entire reason fora process of review existing in the first place. It notes theCommissions observation of the implicit assumptions in the commentsbut would go further and say that the logical conclusion is thatagencies are implying that people who are financially disadvantagedand hence discouraged by the fee are not bona fides. This goesto the very issue of pro-disclosure and openness. OMBUDSMAN 19. The Federation agrees with the Commission in regard to paragraph9.11. In the Federation's experience the low number of unsuccessfulapplication reflects the barriers which exist which discouragepeople against appeals against unsuccessful FOI requests. TheAAT is costly, has delays and is a deterrent to potential applicants.The Federation hopes that the review of the AAT's procedure whichis currently underway will rectify this. The Federation agrees that the AAT should have the power to inspectdocuments claiming exemption prior to a hearing or any time afteran application to review is lodged. We note the Commission's comments in paragraph 9.7 but would arguethat more use be made of the AAT's power to recommendto the Attorney General that costs of the successful party bepaid, particularly, when a conclusive certificate certificateis issued after an application to review is filed. (Nevertheless,the Federation still has difficulty with the issue of conclusivecertificates see earlier comment.) APPLICATION OF FOI TO GOVERNMENT BUSINESS ENTERPRISES (GBE'S) 20. The Federation believes that there is increasing cause forconcern at the commercializing of traditional government functions.The use of GBE's involves the use of public funds and there isan interest therefore in the need for accountability and openness.GBE's are not voted in by the public and are therefore not representativeof them. The Federation agrees with part of paragraph 10.3 that GBE's shouldbe subject to general administrative law, but disagrees with theproposition that the commercial activities of GBE's in a commercialmarket should be exempt. Rather the GBE's should be required tomeet a public interest criteria as in the other exemptions outlinedin the Commission's discussion paper. With respect to paragraphs 10.8 &10.9, contrary to the viewsexpressed, it is not difficult to reconcile the objectives ofthe FOI Act, which focuses on the accountability of executivegovernment where the executive government is handing over vastamounts of its traditional operations into private hands (as ishappening in Victoria). These transactions are done in privateunder the shroud of commercial dealings. There is a minimum ofconsultation and an inability for the public to scrutinize theprocess. Hence, if an open, accountable, good government basedon a democratic model is to be maintained, similar access to GBEdocumentation is essential. In Victoria, fundamental, traditional government control of publicutilities and services is being given over to GBE and privateenterprise e.g.. water, electricity, ambulance services, planning,use of parks, outsourcing, ownership of crown land, housing, schoolsand hospitals. This is done without reference to fundamental principlesof public consultation or input in the tendering or grant of tenderprocess. It is in this context that we warn of the dangers inthe non-extension of FOI to GBE's. Whilst not ignoring the difficulties for business we are of theview that if enterprises are going to enter areas of traditionalgovernment control in the public domain, they must be subjectto the same regimes of accountability as government. Business principles may ensure efficiency and cost effectivenessin a competitive environment but with community care, access tofacilities by the public, the provision of services for thosewho are disadvantaged, it will not necessarily be the most costeffective or efficient result and may well be sacrificed if thereisn't the opportunity for public scrutiny and real input basedupon being fully informed. In paragraph 10.14 you comment on non-disclosure in the competitionscenario. We note that in Victoria, business enterprises haveargued that in the proposed privatization contracts for prisons,documentation relating to planning, positioning, provision ofservices to prisons are documents they are not prepared to disclose.They argue that such information might get into the hands ofcompetitors. Arguments such as this prevent community access toinformation and input of bodies effected( such as prisoner coalitions,and hospitals who are supposed to rendering services) into thespecifications which are contained in the final and bindingcontract. Current practice with public tendering in Victoria isoften done without consultation. Full access to information shouldbe available at an early stage. The Federation has a strong view that a safeguard such as thepublic interest criteria must be enshrined in the Act and so wedisagree with proposal 10.01. PRIVATE SECTOR 21. We refer to the concerns already raised in relation to GBE'sand express the view that similar considerations to those discussedunder the last heading should apply just as equally to the privatesector as to GBE s. We agree with the Commission's proposals in paragraphs 11.5 and11.6 on the extension of the Privacy Act to the private sectorand to GBEs. We agree that individuals should have access to records of privatehospitals as well as public ones. We agree with Chapter 12 that issues of FOI and Privacy must bedealt with in a consistent way to ensure accountability. The Federation needs more time to provide input on issues inrelation to a single Privacy and FOI Act. We requested a meetingin Melbourne with the Privacy Commissioner with respect to thisand other issues, however, a meeting is only to be held in Sydney.We have requested that the discussion papers be sent to us sowe can add to further debate. We would like to be included inany further discussions on this issue. 22. In the Commission's discussion paper it appeared that someof the statistics were incomplete. We therefore recommend thata more comprehensive system for collecting and processing of statisticson FOI be adopted.

Inference as to the degree of supportor otherwise as offered by the Fitzroy Legal Service as an organizationor its staff or volunteers should not be drawn. In relation to protests or rallies, it is not always the aim of participants in the rally to be arrested, however there inevitably can be situations where protesters will be arrested. CONSEQUENCES OF BEING ARRESTED Protesters should consider the implications of beingarrested and subsequently convicted of a criminal offence. Thingsto consider include:- 1) If convicted you will have a criminal record whichin Victoria remains with you for life. 2) Some employers will require to sign a form allowingdisclosure of any prior convictions before they will employ you. 3) A conviction may prevent some professional peoplefrom obtaining registration within their profession. 4) Convictions may be an impediment to obtainingvisas to some countries. Clearly the seriousness of the offence is relevantin considering whether 2), 3) & 4) above are a problem foryou. IF YOU HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED If you have been arrested before, you should also consider: 1) Whether you are currently on any good behaviourbond, community based order or suspended sentence, which may bebreached by any subsequent convictions; 2) Whether you have previously failed to appear onbail, as this may affect your ability to obtain bail if arrestedagain; 3) Whether you have any outstanding warrants inrelation to unpaid fines or other matters. The existence of anyoutstanding warrants will obviously effect your ability to bequickly released from police custody. OFFENCES There are a number of offences which peace demonstratorswould expect they could be charged with:- 1) TRESPASS:-This offence includes refusing to leave a place after being warnedto do so by the owner or person authorised by the owner, wilfuldamage to property where the value of the damage done is lessthan $500. This offence is punishable by a fine or imprisonmentfor up to six months; 2) BILL POSTING/DEFACING PROPERTY:-This offence includes putting up posters, painting signs on roads,buildings etc. without the consent of the owner. Penalty is afine or up to 3 months imprisonment and a person can be orderedto make good any damage. 3) HINDERING POLICE(Inc. Assault and Resist):- It is an offence to assault, resist, obstruct, hinder or delayor insight or encourage any other person to d o so to any policeofficer in the execution of her/his duty. The definition of theoffence is very wide. It could cover non-cooperation with thepolice who are lawfully assisting the occupier of land or arrestingtrespassers. It could also theoretically apply to situations wherepolice directing the course of a demonstration through the city,or are requiring people to move on in a sit-down protest situation.Both the maximum and the usual penalties are the same for hinderpolice as they are for trespass. GETTING ARRESTED A police officer can arrest a person when that personis: (1) Caught committing an offence, or (2) Reasonably suspects the person of having committedan indictable offence. Trespass and hinder police are not indictableoffences. To make an arrest the police officer must: Tell the person they are being arrested Tell the person the reason for the arrest ifit is not obvious from the circumstances. This does not mean youhave to be told the specific charge. Signify by touching the person that they areunder arrest, unless the person has submitted by going with thepolice officer. The police officer can use as much force as is reasonablynecessary to arrest the person. It is an offence to resist arrest, or to make itmore difficult for the police to arrest another person. Resistancemust be active. Merely lying down and failing to cooperateis not resisting arrest. While it is not their only option, police willinvariably arrest protesters and convey them to a police station. DO I HAVE TO GO WITH POLICE? You only have to go with police if you want to, or if you are under arrest. If police wish to move you, or tell you to move, you should ask them "Will I be arrested if I refuse?" or "Is this a warning, after which I will be arrested?" The police can only arrest you if they believe you have broken the law. You should always ask the police officer "Am I under arrest?" and "What for?" Usually before putting you in a police van theywill ask a number of questions. Usually they will ask your nameand address. The law in this area has recently changed and torefuse to give your name and address when lawfully requested couldincur a $500 penalty and a criminal conviction. Continued refusalupon arrest may unnecessarily antagonise police and prevent youfrom being granted bail. NAME AND ADDRESS Crimes Act S 456 AA Police can now ask for your name and address if they believe:Police can now ask for your name and address if they believe you have broken the law; you are about to break the law; you are able to assist them with information about an indictable (serious) offence. Police must tell you the reason for their belief if you ask. However If you refuse to give your name and address, or give any false details, you can be charged with an offence. Police must give you their name, rank, station and number if you ask for it. You can ask that they provide it in writing. The police may also ask questions like: - "Whatis your reason for trespassing?" It is always advisable not to answer such questionsas your answers may limit the defences open to you to use in court.The police will usually take a note of your answers. TALKING TO POLICE Anything you say to police, no matter when or where you say it, may be used by them. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN 'OFF THE RECORD' CONVERSATION. What you say may be used by police in deciding whether or not to charge you, or it might be used against you in court. Apart from giving your name and address to police, it may be in your best interest to say "no comment". Avoid idle conversations with police after being arrested, about the demonstration. REMEMBER: Answering some questions and not others will not help your case. You must be consistent in answering or refusing to answer questions. If you have not been arrested before it will usuallybe difficult to remain silent in the face of what may seem likea harmless casual question. Just remember, you have the rightnot to say anything but anything you do say may be taken downand used in evidence against you. You do and it is! AT THE POLICE STATION After you have been arrested you will be taken toa police station. If you are arrested in a large group it maytake some time for everyone to be processed. You will all be heldtogether in a cell and released one by one as you are processed.At the station you will be asked for your name and your address,your date of birth and you occupation. You should always givethis information. Note that you should give your occupation, notyour current employment status (ie. if you are a qualified teacher,but are currently unemployed, your occupation is still a teacher). The police are allowed to finger print you if youare 15 yrs or older and they suspect on reasonable grounds thatyou have committed an offence. You don't have to have been chargedor summonsed. The police can use reasonable force to take yourfingerprints, with the authority of a sergeant or officer in chargeof a police station. FINGERPRINTING Section 464 K If you are 15 years or older, you have to give your fingerprints to the police if they believe you have committed an offence. If you refuse to give your fingerprints, the police can use reasonable force to get them. PHOTOS & I.D. PARADES Police cannot force you to have your photo taken, or to take part in an identification parade or line-up. SEARCHES If you are under arrest and in police custody, police of the same sex may search you for your own and their own protection. They cannot search you internally or touch you improperly. If you haven't been arrested, police can search you if they have a reasonable belief you are carrying illegal drugs, stolen goods or weapons. The police cannot take your photograph without yourconsent. The law says that the police must allow a person, aboutto be interviewed in relation to an indictable offence, to telephonea member of their family or a legal representative. The positionin relation to non indictable offences such as trespass and hinderpolice is less clear. However, police standing orders say thatpolice must allow respectable persons charged with summary offences(ie. offences which are not indictable offences) to make a telephonecall. SPEAKING TO YOUR FAMILY AND LAWYER Crimes Act S 464 C If you have been taken into police custody, before any formal questioning begins:If you have been taken into police custody, before any formal questioning begins you can attempt to contact a friend or relative; you can telephone a lawyer in private. The police are allowed to ask you questions but youdo not have to answer them. The general rule is that you shouldnot say or write anything about the offence you have been chargedwith unless you have had legal advice. It may be best that you only give the details listedabove and reply " no comment " or " I don't wishto answer any questions " to anything else. IF I AM ARRESTED, HOW LONG CAN THE POLICE HOLD ME? If you are arrested and taken into custody by the police, they can only keep you for a "reasonable time". This will depend on the seriousness of the charges against you, how long it takes to interview you, whether other witnesses need to be interviewed. After this, you may be released without charge, released but charged later, or charged on the spot.If you are charged- IF I AM CHARGED, WHEN WILL I BE RELEASED? If you are charged:- You may be released and given a court date; or You may be released, given a court date, and have certain bail conditions - such as not to return to the area of the demonstration, to report to a police station on a regular basis, or to tell the police of any change of address; or You may be held in custody, in which case you must be brought before either a magistrate or a Bail; Justice as soon as possible. (next sitting court day) BAIL To get bail means that you are allowed to leave thepolice station after agreeing to go to court on a particular day.You will be required to sign a form which is your undertakingto attend court. In some circumstances the court will ask forconditions on bail. (Bail = money which must be paid before youcan be released) All persons have a right to bail except in limitedcircumstances. They include: (1) Where a person has committed offences while onbail; (2) Where a person has prior convictions for failingto answer bail; (3) Where a person is charged with certain seriousoffences, in particular drug offences. In these cases bail may be harder to obtain. Bail may be granted by the police themselves or bya Justice of the Peace or by a court. It is usual to be grantedbail by a JP after being arrested. Bail can be granted to youfree of conditions or on conditions. The most common conditionwhich is likely to be placed on bail is that you do not returnto the area where you were arrested. If you sign the bail conditions you have promisedthe court to abide by those conditions; you may then leave thepolice station. If you do not sign the bail conditions you muststay in custody until your day in court, but you have the rightto sign the conditions and leave at any time. If you do not accept the conditions you will be keptin custody until your case is heard and this could be some time.Where you are held during that time is hard to predict. Initiallyit will be in police custody, either in the cells of the policestation or at the city watch house in Melbourne. You will thenpass into the care of the Office of Corrections who will determinewhere you will be held. Males will be sent to the Melbourne RemandCentre for classification and women will be sent to Fairlea Women's'Prison. GOING TO COURT When bail is fixed you will be given two documents.The first is a charge sheet setting out the charge againstyou. The second is a bail notice. It is important to keepboth documents. The bail notice will have the date you will haveto attend court written on it. This date will be a mention date. On that date, your case can only proceed if you arepleading guilty. If you are pleading not guilty it will have tobe adjourned to a contested hearing date or for a further mentiondate. Even if you are pleading guilty, your case can stillbe adjourned at least once. If you are on bail you must attendcourt on the mention date. If you do not, a warrant may be issuedfor your arrest. You may also be charged with failing to appearon bail, which will make it more difficult to get a grant of bailin future. It is usually a good idea to seek legal advicebefore deciding to plead guilty. Pleading not guilty means thatyou are asking the prosecution to prove the case against you beyondreasonable doubt. COMPLAINTS AGAINST POLICE If you are unhappy with the way police treated you (and other people) at the scene of a demonstration, write down in as much detail the circumstances of your treatment. If you have been injured, make sure that your injuries are photographed, and that you see a doctor as soon as possible. All the statements made by people who felt they were mistreated by police should then be handed to the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints), collectively. If you are unable to afford a private solicitorand are in need of legal advice, then contact either the:- VICTORIA LEGAL AID TEL: (607 0234 (PHONE ADVICE) or the FEDERATION OF COMMUNITY LEGAL CENTRES TEL: 9602 4949 for referral to local Centres.

Box 1139K GPO Melbourne 3000 Victoria Australia Tel: 61 03 9602 4949 Fax: 61 03 9602 4948 Disclaimer:The Views Expressed in this paper may or may not be supportedby the Fitzroy Legal Service. Inference as to the degree of supportor otherwise as offered by the Fitzroy Legal Service as an organizationor its staff or volunteers should not be drawn. 1.INTRODUCTION The Federation of Community Legal Centres comes into contact witha wide range of clientele from across Victoria many of whom aredisadvantaged and marginalised. We also represent many young individualswho come into contact with drugs and our centres witness at firsthand the impact of the use of drugs on their lives. Many of these young people use drugs for a wide range of reasonswhich extend beyond 'criminality'. Alienation, depression, loneliness,a need to escape the unpleasantness of memories of physical, psychologicaland sexual assault, low self esteem, problems of boredom, domesticviolence, homelessness, the lack of identity caused by unemployment,and a lack of familial support. Of course, this list is by nomeans exhaustive but it serves to demonstrate that the causesof drug use are complex. Solutions require a creative and holisticapproach which incorporates a commitment to the provision of supportmechanisms for those who use drugs or are likely to use them,education as to drug safety and individual responsibility, theprovision of drug counselling and rehabilitation and the needfor a genuine attempt to rectify many of the social problems whichlead our youth and others towards the use of drugs. It is in thiscontext that we call upon the Premier's Advisory Council to makerecommendations that tackle a problem which extends beyond theblack and white need to control 'criminals' and 'drug pushers'or a 'war on drugs' involving militaristic measures to deal withusers who are not the 'enemy' but rather to the grey areas ofthe neglected and often vulnerable or disaffected members of ourcommunity. We say this in the realistic context of the need to bravely andobjectively address the basic assumptions about the benefits ofprohibition of drug use in this state and Australia. Prohibitiontends to make drug users go 'underground' forcing them to concealthe extent of their use, exposing users to health and infectionrisks and forcing them into a life of crime in order to supporttheir habit and exposing them to the vagrancies of prison life. It should be noted that the majority of Victoria's prison populationare incarcerated for drug related offenses and that drugs arereadily available in our prisons in any event. A number of Royalcommissions and Parliamentary Inquiries have bemoaned the factthat getting hard data on drug usage is impossible(see Cleeland(1989),Rankin & Kerr (1981), (1979) Prohibition appears counterproductive to finding a solution on drugs. Currently, there is little control over who uses drugs, who suppliesthem, the level of contamination and accordingly, the risk tolife involved in their use. In 1993 the Public Health Association in its "Principlesand Actions For Drug Policy Reform (see Appendix 1) stated thatin 1993, illicit drugs were estimated to be responsible for 508deaths representing 2% of all drug related deaths and 9.5% ofperson-years of life lost due to drug related causes. Deaths dueto illicit drugs increased 33% from 3.6 to 4.8 per 100 000 between1981 and 1990. There is little incentive for those who use drugsto find appropriate medical care or to try to 'kick the habit'because of the fear of prosecution by the criminal justice systemand fear of police involvement. Most illicit drug-related deathsare due to accidental overdose which are a consequence of theuncertain purity of street drugs. So long as their is a lucrative black market in the drug tradethere will continue to be an increase in the trade as profitabilityis the best motive for those who deal in large scale drug operationsand who often have little regard for the ultimate damage theirtrade has on consumers. The profit incentive also exposes manypeople in authority to the dangers of corruption. For this reasonthe Federation is of the view that by taking the profit elementout of the equation many of the problems of controlling the 'illicit'trade in drugs will be obviated. We also note that media coverage has tended to target specificethnic groups in the Western suburbs as 'the problem'. This approachfosters an erroneous assumption that promotes racism, fear, antagonismand insecurity in the community. The use of drugs is widespreadand is not confined to the Western Suburbs nor to a specific ethnicgroup. We draw attention to the extent of drug use in many schoolsboth private and public(note articles over the years with referenceto the availability of drugs in schools such as Wesley and ScotchCollege). Such assumptions also ignore the fact that the use ofdrug abuse is an International problem and Victoria can learnfrom other countries and their mistakes and successes. To dealwith the issue of drug reform as an issue of law enforcement isto do so in a vacuum and to head towards the unpleasant risk ofcreating an underclass of the magnitude that exists in the UnitedStates. 2.TERMS OF REFERENCE For the reasons outlined the Federation of Community Legal Centresare of the view that the terms of reference for the Premier'sDrug Advisory Council are too narrow and will not successfullytackle the complex issues surrounding drug usage in this state.To presuppose that one can prevent drug usage without truly examiningthe social problems that exist which lead people to drugs is,on any objective view, not a serious attempt to examine and rectifythe drug problem (I refer to the Council's advertisement in "TheAge" 10/1.96. On page 4 outlining the public consultationprogram) We also note that the time lines involved in the lead up to themaking of written submissions is too short and does not correspondwith the complexity of the drug issue in this state. The shortnessof time has meant that endeavors to access statistics at the Departmentof Justice has been impossible as they required two weeks to providesuch information. Also many people were on leave We also notethat this can only have placed significant strain on the Premier'sDrug Advisory Council. We make the following observations aboutthe terms of reference: 1. The references appear to imply that prohibition is the onlyway to go. They do not open the way for the consideration of creativealternatives to a system of prohibition which appears to be exacerbatingthe existing problems. 2. The references only examine the use of "illicit"drugs. They do not refer to abusive substances generally includingthose that can be legally obtained nor do they tackle the problemswith underage glue and petrol sniffing, and chroming which aresignificant problems in a range of suburbs in this state. (Wenote this problem is not confined to the Western Suburbs but extendsto the Northern, South Eastern, Eastern, other outer suburbs andrural areas). 3. The terms of reference emphasize " law enforcement"rather than prioritising education and treatment programs e.g.the ranking of the strategies and specific programs in ReferenceFour and the militaristic terminology in the use of words suchas "combat" promote claims that this is a "waron drugs" rather than an endeavor to deal realistically andin a sensitive way with the complex issues of safety for the usersand the community, responsibility, therapy and the scientificconsiderations. Accordingly, the Federation of Community Legal Centres will endeavorto use these terms of reference to advance the debate and enhancethe list of the range of alternative policies which could reformour drug laws and potentially benefit the entire community. Wealso make this submission in the context of the Premier, Mr. Kennett'sown public statements outlining that he is not necessarily committedto prohibition but to solving the drug problem. 3.WHY THE CURRENT APPROACH ISN'T WORKING Currently the Victorian budget for drug services is $26 million.We would suggest that given the need for services such as rehabilitation,detoxification, education and counselling this is not enough.Further a number of existing services have been closed or restrictedin their manner of operation without adequate provision for pluggingthe holes left by such actions. For example, there are currentlyonly 36 withdrawal beds in Victoria funded under the new drugwithdrawal model in Coburg, Fitzroy and Dandenong. All of thesewithdrawal units have waiting lists. This demonstrates a lackof any real willingness to resolve the drug problem in this state.To resolve the issues surrounding drug reform a genuine commitmentby government to the provision of resources, funding and servicesmust be forthcoming. THE FAILURE OF PROHIBITION The policy of prohibition in Victoria has failed. Prohibitionhas not suppressed the supply of illicit drugs, nor has it reducedtheir use. Prohibition policies are fatally flawed because they assume itis possible to prevent supply and use of illicit drugs by enforcingcriminal sanctions. This is assumption runs contrary to the experiencein Victoria where considerable resources have been devoted toenforcing the law without any reduction in supply/use. The failure of current policy is no more evident than the existenceof drugs in Victorian Prisons. Prohibition cannot be successful because some citizens will alwaysseek to use drugs regardless of penalties. In these circumstances,prohibition policies can only increase the harm caused by druguse. PROHIBITION CAUSES CRIME It has created a black market where drugs are only available atartificially inflated prices. It is estimated prohibition isdirectly responsible for a significant proportion of all propertycrime because users are forced to commit crimes to pay for drugs. It is also clear some violent crimes are related to the largeprofits associated with the drug trade. As a consequence a significant percentage of Victoria's prisonpopulation is in jail as a direct consequence of current druglaws, for drug related property crime and drug offenses themselves. For example, it is estimated that 80% of women and 60% of menin prison are there on drug related charges ( see Helen Barnacle,Drug Program Manager, Task Force Community Agency The Editorial'The Age' 5/12/95) PROHIBITION ENCOURAGES THE SALE OF ILLICIT DRUGS Prohibition increases the potential for profit from the sale ofdrugs and enables pyramid supply structures to be establishedto generate huge profits. This selling structure relies uponthe active recruitment of new users and the introduction of newproducts to existing users. Odyssey House estimates the cost borneby the community for each dependent user in Melbourne is $75,000per year, $53,000 coming from drug related crime. PROHIBITION ENCOURAGES CORRUPTION The black market means very large sums of money are availableto influence those required to enforce the law. There is greatpotential for corruption at every stage in the process. The NSWPolice Royal Commission has demonstrated how prohibition promotescorruption and how once entrenched, such corruption can threatenthe entire criminal justice system. It would be unrealistic toassume the Victorian Police are immune to such pressure. PROHIBITION POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED AT ENORMOUS FINANCIALCOST It is estimated $250 million per annum is spent Australia wideon drug law enforcement.(Marks "Costs of Prohibition"in Fox & Mathews Drugs and the Law Sydney Allen & Unwin1991) The resources of Victoria Police, the Office of the Directorof Public Prosecutions and the Courts are devoted to drug prosecutionswithout any evidence of a reduction in supply or drug use. Based on the provisional statistics released by Commissioner Comriein July, 1995, in the year 1994/95 the police processed peoplefor use or possess a drug of dependence (excluding traffickingand cultivation) resulting in the laying of 19,959 charges. Thismeans that more than 10,000 times the police were required toapprehend offenders, transport them to the police station, conducta taped record of interview in most cases, charge and fingerprintthe defendant, produce statements of lead up questioning, andprepare the brief for the prosecutor. The matter must then beprocessed by the courts. In 1994 the magistrate's court disposedof 21, 094 charges relating to possession or use of a drug ofdependence/ addiction, excluding trafficking or cultivation. The failure of such activities is demonstrated by statistics whichshow in Victoria the overwhelming majority of drug prosecutionswere of users not traffickers. The Health and Community ServicesVictorian Drug Strategy statistics Handbook in Table 45 (page7)states that reported offenses for 1991-1992 for Cannabis possession/usewere 16,014 and for trafficking and manufacture totalled 4,777. PROHIBITION CONCENTRATES RESOURCES ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THEEXPENSE OF HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES The Victorian and Federal Governments have limited resources toaddress this problem. Prohibition requires resources to firstand foremost be directed to law enforcement. As stated above anestimated $250 million per annum is spent Australia wide on druglaw enforcement. It is estimated Victoria's portion of that costis significantly more than the $26 million per annum spent inVictoria on drug services Strategies which actually address theproblems caused by drug use are given second priority and in timesof recession the funding for such strategies may be severely reducedor withdrawn altogether. PROHIBITION HAS ERODED CIVIL LIBERTIES State and Federal Governments have acknowledged prohibition isnot succeeding by attempting to secure more convictions by "streamlining"the investigation and prosecution process. This has been doneby interfering with the rights of individuals, such as privacy,the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. Federal authorities can now investigate the financial affairsof anyone who deposits $10,000.00 or more in cash, on the suspicionthe money is associated with illicit drugs. Law enforcement agencieshave been given wide powers of investigation in relation to drugoffenses. In Victoria, the police have been granted extensiveinvestigation powers enabling them to demand name and addressesof suspects obtain finger prints and conduct forensic proceduresincluding body cavity searches. The Courts will accept the uncorroboratedevidence of the police in drug trials. In some instances theonus of proof has been reversed, requiring persons accused ofcertain drug offenses to prove their innocence. Despite these changes, there is no evidence to suggest an overallreduction of the supply or use of illicit drugs. In these circumstancesthe erosion of fundamental rights cannot be justified. If we persist with drug prohibition, future strategies will befocused on securing convictions and increasing penalties. Thiscan only result in a greater erosion of civil liberties. These"solutions" may enable governments to be seen to betaking decisive action but these measures have serious consequencesfor civil liberties. PROHIBITION OPERATES MORE HARSHLY ON USERS THAN THOSE WHO TRAFFIC Statistics for reporting of drug offenses in Victoria for 1991-1992show 20,000 users/possessors compared with 3,209 for manufacture/cultivationof drugs for the same period. (see Table 45-page 7 of H.&C.S.Vic. Drug Strategy Statistics Handbook) This suggests users aremuch more likely to be prosecuted than those who manufactureillicit drugs. The same source indicates 82% of convictions fordrug offenses in the Magistrates' Court were for the lesser offensesof possession and use. Suppliers have money and power enablingthem to avoid detection and making it more likely they can successfullyavoid serious penalties. The penalties flowing from prosecution are also likely to be moresevere for users. Without support an addict is unlikely to beable to comply with the sentencing order which means she or heis at risk of further prosecution for breach. Incarceration withouttreatment may also pose serious health risks. PROHIBITION IS A GREATER THREAT TO COMMUNITY HEALTH THAN THECONTROLLED AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS Most drug related deaths are a direct consequence of prohibition. Drug related deaths are not caused by the pharmacological propertiesof these drugs rather, death is usually the result of accidentaloverdose due to uncertainty about the purity. The second mostcommon cause of death is due to contaminants. In both cases,prohibition accords these drugs an illegal status which removesany control over their production and restricts information regardingsafe dosage and the effects of their use. Prohibition is incompatible with public health strategies. Itmarginalises users, isolating them from treatment for addictionand drug related illnesses for fear of prosecution. It also restrictstheir access to information about safe drug practices and thetransmission of viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis. Prohibition increases the cost of methadone and controlled availabilityprograms providing drugs. PROHIBITION REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS The very fact of the illegal status of some drugs makes them moreattractive to certain sections of the community. This has thepotential to work against education programs. The arbitrary classification of some drugs as illegal and thecondoning of others such as alcohol and nicotine affects the credibilityof educational information on illicit drugs. It may be easierto dismiss information on the harm caused by illicit drugs aspropaganda when it is viewed in the context of the greater socialand health problems caused by legal drugs such as alcohol. The transition from prohibition to harm minimization will requirereform of existing drug laws and the redirection of resourcesfrom law enforcement to strategies which provide the greatestlevel of harm reduction for currently illicit drugs. The strategies required will be different for each type of drugand will be determined by the modes of production distributionand use associated with each. In each case some reforms can be implemented immediately and otherswill need to be implemented over time after education campaigns,further research and monitoring of the reforms. 4.LEGAL & PRESCRIPTION DRUGS It is noted that the current investigation conducted by the Premier'sDrug Advisory Council emphasizes the supply and use of illicitdrugs in Victoria. It was established following extensive mediacoverage of heroin trafficking in the Western Suburbs of Melbourne,creating an impression that particular region was in the midstof a "Heroin Crisis" or "war". Whilst social and criminal problems related to the abuse of illicitsubstances continue to be of major concern, it is the experienceof Community Legal Centres and other community workers in thewestern suburbs, that by far the most serious issues of substanceabuse relate to legal and prescription drugs. It should alsobe emphasized that the criminal and social problems related toillicit substance abuse is very much a product of the system ofprohibition. For this reason, this submission emphasizes alternativemodels to prohibition. Prescription drugs such as rohypnol, serapax and mogadon are cheap,alternative substances to heroin. The level of abuse of thesesubstances, whilst difficult to measure in objective terms, issignificant according to community workers in the western suburbs. By far the most devastating drug in terms of criminal activityand social dysfunction, remains to be alcohol. Alcohol continuesto produce more social disruption and violent crime than illicitsubstances. Alcohol's pharmacology is such that alcohol intoxicationis often associated with uninhibited aggressive behavior - a majorreason why alcohol intoxication is a major factor in over 70%of homicides. By contrast, cannabis has a calming effect andheroin is a pain killer which is most likely to aid sleep andwill not increase aggression. There is therefore a contradictionin the status of alcohol (which is legal ) and some drugs whichare illicit but do not have such harmful results. In terms of numbers of deaths caused by substance abuse each year,in Australia, there are relatively few deaths - about 500 peryear - involving intravenous illegal drug use. There have beenno deaths officially recorded as due to cannabis and there islittle evidence of morbidity due to cannabis use in Australia. By contrast, nicotine causes 18 000 deaths per year and alcoholcauses over 6 000 deaths per year. Finally, the practice of "chroming" and the abuse ofother inhalants has in recent years become one of the more serioussubstance abuse problems in the inner-city regions of Collingwood,Richmond, Flemington, Kensington, North Melbourne and Carlton. Chroming means sniffing chrome based paint, by spraying the paintfrom an aerosol can into a plastic bag, and then placing one'sface or entire head into the bag to inhale the vapors. Otherinhalants that are commonly abused include glue, cleaning fluid,felt tipped pens, correction fluid, petrol and gas from lighters. Unlike many other forms of substance use, the practice of chromingand inhalant abuse is inherently dangerous, given the chemicalcomponents of the substances involved, and cannot be practicedwithout assuming a significant health risk. The physical dangers of this form of substance abuse include lossof physical fitness, permanent breathing problems, blindness,asphyxiation, permanent kidney, liver and heart problems, braindamage and damage to the central nervous system. There have beenseveral deaths reported from chroming and inhalant abuse, bothimmediately after inhalation, and also after long term abuse. Chroming and inhalant abuse was given significant media attentionin May and June, 1995, in a similar manner to recent reports ofheroin abuse in the Western Suburbs. The media reports emphasizedthe escalating use in the practice amongst young people, mainlyaged between 14 and 16, with some users as young as 10. Manywere of the opinion that the practice was popular because it wasa cheaper, accessible alternative to other drugs. The only action taken to remedy the problem has been local communityinitiatives ( such as the "Footscray Drug and Safer CommunityForum Proceeding's Draft Report, 13th September,1995" andthe St Kilda Project "Harmonize To Minimize") to provideeducation about the dangers of chroming, and to provide recreationalalternatives to young people in the area. Such existing initiativesprovide a plethora of ideas which should be evaluated and utilisedrather than reinventing the wheel. There has been minimal governmentfunding or support to address the problem of chroming and otherforms of drug usage in the inner city regions of Melbourne. Further,funding for support services, youth services, housing programs,provisions of recreational options and areas of interest for youthneed to be dramatically increased rather than curtailed. 5. WHAT WE CAN DO Drug Reform strategies must be neither simplistic nor half-hearted.The drug problem is a serious problem particularly for today'syouth and those who are socially disadvantaged. It impacts onthe community at large and no measure of increase in police powersor increase in sentences will truly tackle the drug issue at grassroots level. As stated, such measures may actually exacerbatethe problems of illegal availability, going underground, crime,the non-utilisation of health and other services for fear of prosecutionand consequent spread of HIV and Hepatitis. Today's youth as stated,resort to drugs for a range of reasons. Adequate youth services,support counselling and recreational opportunities need to befacilitated and offered for the youth to give them options toboredom and some substitute familial support if necessary. It is for these reasons that the Federation of Community LegalCentres calls on the Premier's Advisory Council to be brave, objective, creative and bold in its recommendations. END PROHIBITION It is the Federation's view that the current laws in relationto drugs need to be reviewed with a view to harm minimisationrather than drug prohibition. Prohibition introduces the elementof fear and criminality into drug use which forces its use undergroundwhere it cannot be controlled and provides huge, untaxed profitsto a unscrupulous underworld. Deaths occur due to the impurityof the available drugs. Our youth are enticed by rebelliousnessto partake in something illegal, public funds are being allocatedto drug enforcement which could be redirected to effective harmminimisation strategies and eventually to other areas of needincluding crime prevention. Currently, a large proportion of prisonersin this state are in prison due to drug related offenses. Thereality is that drug usage in prisons is widespread and so thereis an inherent contradiction in place. Research needs to be undertakeninto how to control the need for drug use amongst prisoners. As at 31st August 1995 there were 365 doses of drugs administeredper day to women within Fairlea Prison of these 141 were psychotropicdrugs and 53 were analgesics (see "Fairlea Women's Prison-An Analysis of Time Spent Administering Medication" ) As at the 16th August 1995 there were 125 women in custody inFairlea this equates to over one and a half mind altering drugadministrations per woman per day ! Whilst the management benefits to those in charge of the prisonare obvious if prisoners are highly doped on medications, thecost in human terms is enormous. Their ability to function withinprison and to use their time in prison constructively, to participatein education and other personal development programs is so enormouslyreduced that their time spent in custody has greatly reduced benefits. There is also the major problem that when women are released,many do not know what drugs they have been taking or how to continueto maintain the same levels of medication. The obvious choiceon release, is to revert to illicit drug use with many women tragicallyoverdosing within three months of release. Deprivation of liberties is not the answer nor are intrusive practicesof search rather, a constructive study of the reasons why drugusage is widespread in prisons is needed and alternative strategiesshould be adopted. E.g. Recent disclosures about the Junee Prisonin NSW highlight the need for education to give hope, stimulationand relieve boredom amongst prisoners. Further deprivation ofprisoner's rights in the fight against drugs is actually morelikely to lead to depression and a desire to take drugs to escapetheir cruel world. The profit incentive for the black market in drugs seems to continueunaffected by current measures to curtail trade in drugs. Withthe drug trade earning $300 Billion a year worldwide, second onlyto the trade in arms, there is certainly an incentive for theblack market to continue with fearlessness, disregard for humanlife and for pervading corruption. The corruption through exposureto the drug underworld revealed by the Woods/Fitzgerald RoyalCommissions serves to undermine public confidence in our policeforce and hence our security in the knowledge we will be adequatelyprotected. To treat the drug problem as a "war against drugs"is unrealistic and absurd as it paints the "enemy" asdrugs which are an inanimate object, rather than focus the issueas one of removal of the profit incentive for illegal operatorsand removing as far as possible risks to safety of the users andcommunity generally. 6. ALTERNATIVE MODELS TO PROHIBITION It is strongly recommended that the Advisory Council explore existingand proposed models which proffer alternatives to prohibitionas a means of addressing illicit substance abuse, together withtheir related social problems. Specifically, models which proposea system of controlled supply of heroin should be investigatedand encouraged. HARM MINIMISATION Our submission proposes a harm minimisation strategy that wouldbe implemented in stages. Harm minimisation involves the protectionof both the users of drugs and the community at large. It seeksto bring about a sense of responsibility, regulation and subsequentlymore safety in the use of drugs. It requires political commitment,one which was given in theory at the 1985 Premier's Conference(after the acceptance of the National Drug Strategy which agreedwith harm minimisation) but has in reality not really seen thelight of day. Harm minimisation will result in less associated crime arisingbecause the drugs are more readily available and so the needfor theft, prostitution , burglary and other associated crimeis obviated. It will take away the major motivation of the blackmarket in the supply of drugs, namely profit and will also reducethe temptation of corruption for officials. Harm minimisationwith its emphasis on responsible and safe use, combined with accurateeducation and the provision of rehabilitation and counsellingfor users would bring people's habits out in the open and providefor information for further accurate research which to date hasbeen hindered by prohibition. Objective policies and legal strategies need to be revised soas to ensure controlled production, manufacture and distributionof drugs of dependence and psychotropic substances. There is aneed for rigorous scientific trialing, controls on price and themanner of consumption. Caution should be adopted when analysingoverseas experiences in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Swedenand the Netherlands as such experiences will often be effectedby the social and political contexts of each country and whetherthere has been an effective evaluation of their outcome. Thisis not to say that they should be disregarded as they providevaluable information but they should be given due consideration. Australia because it is a Federation of states has the abilityto enable different trials and innovative programs to occur whichsuit the particular social and political context of each state.Then, after evaluation the best possible approach could be adoptednationally and lessons could be learnt about the difficultiesand strengths of each approach. This is what makes Australia andVictoria a good venue to address drug reform constructively. TheFederation of Community Legal Centres advocates two stages. Eachwould apply only to persons over eighteen years of age. Youngpersons under eighteen found using would be educated and offeredthe services of a counselor. Persons supplying people under theage of eighteen would be subject to prosecution as with alcohol.It is important to note that to treat users under the age of eighteenas "criminals" exposes them to greater risk and so alternativesto conviction need to be explored. The Federation of Community Legal Centres believes that differenttrialing of drug models should occur and be adequately supported.Desired outcomes and objectives should be clearly articulatedat the outset of such trials. Trials should not just have a managementfocus but also a therapeutic and harm minimisation focus. Evaluationsof pilots and trials should be done independently and be non partisan.The most effective programs could then be adopted. All such trialingshould endeavor not to leave participants in the programs worseoff. STAGE 1 The National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health ofthe Australian National University, together with the AustralianInstitute of Criminology have proposed a three stage heroin trialtreatment option for dependent heroin users. The A.C.T. HeroinTrial proposes to give people the choice of heroin and/or methadonetreatment programs, to determine if such an approach assists thosepeople who are not assisted by methadone alone. In particular,it seeks to ascertain whether such people are healthier, leada more stable life, stop committing crime and use less drugs. It will also seek to ascertain whether such a program is usefulin the long term, and whether this form of treatment will savemoney for the community. The trial involves two initial pilot studies in Canberra, which,if shown to be worthwhile, will lead to a two year trial in Canberraand two other cities. The first pilot study is to be conductedin Canberra and would involve 40 dependent heroin users chosenfrom registered dependent users resident in the A.C.T. since 1993. The participants would be offered the choice of heroin and/ormethadone treatment programs. The first pilot study would runfor 6 months at an estimated cost of $800 000. Pilot Study 1 will be deemed a success if the following criteriaare met: * That a stable maintenance dose of injectable heroin or injectableheroin plus oral methadone is found for more than half of theparticipants; * That injectable heroin maintenance treatment can be successfullyintegrated with oral methadone maintenance treatment; * That there are indications in improvements in at least halfof the participants in terms of health, criminal behavior andsocial functioning. Should the first pilot study yield satisfactory results, the secondpilot study would then be implemented. Again, this stage wouldbe conducted in Canberra, and would involve 250 dependent heroinusers, including the 40 from the first pilot study. The 250 userswould be chosen from registered dependent users resident in theA.C.T. since 1993. Of those participating, 50% would receiveheroin or a combination of heroin and methadone treatment, and50% would receive methadone treatment only, for the purposes ofcomparison. The second pilot study would also run for six months,but at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. Pilot Study 2 will be deemed a success if certain criteria aremet. These include an indication that dependent heroin userswho had previously dropped out of methadone treatment are attractedback to treatment, and that the retention rate for both this groupand for those recruited from current methadone clients is betterthan for participants who receive oral methadone only. Othercriteria include: * That a stable dose of injectable heroin or injectable heroinplus oral methadone can be found for more than half of the participantsin the group of users who are not on methadone only. * That injectable heroin maintenance treatment can be integratedsuccessfully with oral methadone maintenance treatment. * That at the end of six months, there are indications of improvementsin at least half of the participants involved in heroin or heroin/methadonetreatment, in terms of health, criminal behavior and social functioning. The major trial would only be implemented should the second pilotstudy yield satisfactory results. The trial would be conductedin Canberra and two other cities, with 1 000 dependent users intotal (i.e. 350 in each city, including those involved in thesecond pilot study in Canberra). It would target three groupsof dependent heroin users - those who have never been in treatment,those who have dropped out of treatment, and current methadoneclients who would prefer the expanded treatment option. Of thoseparticipating in each city, 50% would receive heroin or a combinationof heroin/methadone treatment, and for the purposes of comparison,50% would receive methadone only. The trial would run for twoyears. As well as looking at the criteria for success for thetwo pilot studies, the trial would specifically look at the abilityof the treatment to attract and retain in treatment those whohave never been in treatment, or those who have dropped out ofmethadone only treatment, as well as improving retention ratesfor those who previously had been involved in methadone only treatmentprograms. It is important to note that the trial also seeks to assess theimprovement in participants in terms of health, criminal behaviorand social functioning. It should be emphasized that in thiscontext, dependent heroin users' lifestyles, health and criminalbehavior may be improved by access to a regular, legal and safesupply of heroin as part of their treatment program. The successof the trial should not be assessed in terms of whether, overtime, the participants' heroin dependency is reduced or eradicated. For many, heroin dependency is an incurable illness, that requiresongoing treatment and management. For such people, the successof the trial is indicated in terms of a reduction in criminalbehavior used to support a heroin dependency, improved healthby means of a safe, legal and monitored supply of heroin, andgenerally a more stable lifestyle. Also, it is important that those participating in the pilotstudies and the trial are not left abandoned should a decisionbe made to discontinue the program beyond the pilot study stage,or to discontinue the trial. It is imperative that heroinor heroin/methadone treatment continue to be available to thosewho received it under the pilot studies and the trial. The National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, togetherwith the Australian Institute of Criminology have called for extensivefinancial support from outside the A.C.T. to fund the pilot studies,given that these studies have extensive national significance. Accordingly, it is strongly recommended, given the groundworkalready undertaken in terms of this proposal, and given the currentconcern of the Victorian Government to explore options for dealingwith heroin abuse in Victoria, that the Victorian Government providesignificant financial support to assist in the funding of thepilot studies. In addition, should the program progress to thetrial stage, it is recommended that the Victorian Government proposethat Melbourne be one of the two other cities in which the twoyear heroin trial is conducted. In addition, the Federation would recommend that immediate stepsbe taken to legalise use, possession and personal cultivationof cannabis. Self administration should not be a criminal offense. Any harm is restricted to the user and abuse is more appropriatelytreated as a health problem rather than a concern of the criminaljustice system. Criminal sanctions should be abolished for thepossession of small quantities of cannabis . In 1991,it was found that 39,296 Australians were arrested on drug relatedoffenses in 1991. 83% of these arrests related to cannabis(CommonwealthDepartment of Community Services and health(1990) Statistics onDrug Abuse in Australia 1989 AGPS, Canberra). Convictions foruse invariably relied upon admissions made to police with theconsequent potential for abuse by law enforcement Commercial supplierscould be licensed to supply marijuana to people aged 18 yearsand over. agencies. The issuing of licenses for the productionand sale of cannabis would be accompanied by an education campaignregarding the health effects of using cannabis. The operationof licensed suppliers could be controlled to ensure compliancewith standards relating to cannabis production and the manufactureof cannabis products. Licensed suppliers will also be required to provide consumer informationregarding the chemical constituents of products, usage and affects,including appropriate health warnings. It would be illegal tosell cannabis without a license and people infringing the lawwill be subject to criminal sanctions similar to current penaltiesfor trafficking. Cannabis is now widely used for pain managementparticularly in the treatment of HIV related conditions. 1200 studies indicate that the side affects of cannabis use areminimal when compared to prescription drugs or alcohol. Side effectsare usually confined to heavy users. (Hall. W, "Health andPsychological Consequences of Cannabis Use "National DrugStrategy monograph 25. No 15. National Campaign Against Drug Abuse).The basis for legalization cannabis for persons over the age ofeighteen, as a first stage is because it is easier to set up controlson its form of production by enabling personal use, possessionand cultivation in non trafficable quantities. Expiation noticesystems have been tried in South Australia and the ACT, thesedo not really move away from the issue of responsible, and controlleduse but merely retain the criminal nature and from a court casemanagement point of view may be desirable but don't go towardsdealing with the complex issues outlined. We would recommend thatVictoria adopt a new approach and a decision then be taken asto which works best. STAGE 2 This stage involves the legalization of all drugs and providesfor their licensing, controlled manufacture and for clear, accurate,detailed labeling of contents and amounts. Many drugs will needpreparation time to set up controlled modes of production andso the Federation believes this level of legalization should bestaggered. At the outset drug usage should not be assumed tobe an issue for the criminal justice system but only in a socialcontext (as for example is the current situation with alcohol).Only when there is a problem with addiction should it become amatter for the health fraternity(as is the case again with alcohol.In tandem with use there would be accurate community education)Closer liaison and education of the medical profession and thepharmaceutical profession should be fostered in relation to servicesavailable and their ethical responsibilities in the distributionof all drugs and their responsibilities under a regulated system. Recognition must exist as to different properties, methods ofintake, manner of use and chemical effects of different drugsand further research into the best methods of regulating eachshould occur. The method of intake of drugs is diverse and manyexpose users to increased safety risk. This situation is encouragedby prohibition. Legalization would make enable access to safermethods of ingestion. Stage 2 requires many controls and changes to be put into effectbefore legalization can occur. Initially this may seem a dauntingproposal however, with drugs such as heroine(and other opioids),Cocaineand Amphetamines that there are really serious and challengingissues of infection, serious crime, loss of life and threat tothe community reside and such efforts are warranted. The best manner of licensing, manufacturing, distributing andcontrolling the specific drugs should be investigated. It is concededthat by legalizing cannabis only a small dent in the black markettrade in drugs will be made. It is also noted that some of theprofits made from cannabis trade are reinjected into the manufactureof other drugs. So long as the hefty profits that can be madefrom the use of these drugs exist, there will be an illicit anduncontrollable trade which will proliferate and create an undesirableand widespread underclass of users as exists in the United Statesof America. In the United States there have been increases in police powers,a reduction in personal liberties and a tendency to deal moreharshly with offenders. None of these features have proven effectivein dealing with the increasing drug problem in the States, ifanything the problem continues to become more widespread. Accordingly, the Federation of Community Legal Centres is of theview that the issue of trafficking and use of drugs needs to betackled head on and with bravery. Therapeutic, harm minimisationand crime prevention approaches must be embraced before our drugproblem escalates in the manner of the United States. At Legal Centres we find ourselves increasingly acting for youngstersfrom a large variety of backgrounds, wealthy and poor, who feelalienated and disassociated from the rest of the community-forthem drugs can provide a solace. It is the Federation's view thatprohibition serves to further alienate these people. To continueblindly along the road of prohibition without a considerationand commitment to the options available could well see Victoriafollowing the American example. It should be accepted that drugsare an International dilemma and that Victoria given its populationsize and commitment to resolution of the problem can adopt alternativestrategies. The Government would monitor, control, and regulate the manufacture,production and distribution of drugs through some form of an independentLicensing Authority which would need to be well resourced (perhapsthe Federal government could make a commitment to contribute tosuch an authority as the first move towards looking at a Nationalstrategy). There would be a levy attached to drugs (as is thecase with tobacco and alcohol) which would reimburse the settingup fees, provide resources for the other parts of the programand the surplus would go into government revenue. Private organisations would apply for licenses, however, onceestablishing their credentials and ability to manufacture accordingto the requirements they would be subject also to the normal provisionsof the Trade Practices Act on misrepresentation, monopolies, pricefixing and pyramid selling (which is the current system with prohibition)see diagram below: Further research is clearly needed on the logistics.The Council is referred to the Redfern Legal Centre Model. TheFederation is of the view that such further research into theestablishment of regulations, controls and conditions for trade(e.g. Where should outlets for drugs be?) Should be undertakenwith a view to resolving the drug problem and with a view to reducingthe devastating consequences of current drug use in relation tocrime, death, mental illness, and harm. It is essential that the later stages of the Federation's drugstrategy be executed and not placed on the 'backburner' as beingtoo difficult. Before legalization a number of controls and regulatorybodies will need to be established so as to monitor, license andregulate the industry. Clearly there will be revenue from leviesimposed on the drugs. This would enable funding for resourcesto put into education, rehabilitation and accurate informationforums. There may be some initial cost to government but therewould be scope for such amounts to be recouped. The followingareas will need organising: Manufacture Labeling Licensing Control Rehabilitation Counselling Method of manufacture Tools for using Drugs 7.EDUCATION There is a difference between accurate education and propaganda.The reality is that youth are perceptive and can often discernthe difference between the two. Propaganda will often be dismissedby youth as exaggerated and will accordingly be ignored. Thereis also a tendency to mystify drugs and thereby attract the rebelliousyouths. If education is to be effective it needs to gain credibilityby being objective and accurate in order to be taken seriously. The reality is that drugs are boring and this factor should beacknowledged. Education should focus on safety and responsibility.Many of these comments are not just limited to the education ofyouth but to the community generally. There is currently somegood data which has been produced in Victorian schools in relationto alcohol education which could be extended to gaining informationon attitudes to and use of drugs by youth. Care needs to be takenin the design of curriculum and the manner in which such courseswill be evaluated and improved. Many of our youth however willnot have access to schools such as the homeless. Therefore educationprograms that are accessible to these people must be implemented.Peer education is often a good way of breaking down the barriers. 8.REHABILITATION Drug users should be given the ability to access such serviceswithout fear of prosecution. Programs must be diverse so as toprovide a choice especially given the range of drugs and treatmentsneeded. There must be effective follow-up. Our observations withmany of our clients are that they are weaned off their drug ofaddiction and then dropped. Some have died through overdose orlack of attendant care. The re-establishment of the users dignityshould be inherent in any program given our earlier observationsabout the low self esteem which often leads to drug usage. Needleexchanges need to be established more widely around the states.These should not be policed as this deters users from safe practices.On talking with our clients many expressed the desire to use drugsmore safely and to even lose their addiction. They feel that inthe current climate of prohibition their fear of prosecution andinability to access services(many expressed distress as theircentre had closed), makes it difficult. 9.TREATIES Trials will be possible as they are for harm reduction and therapeuticpurposes under treaties. Australia needs to interpret its obligationsunder these treaties more liberally than it currently does. Dependingon the success of our programs in Australia our commitments toInternational Treaties may need reconsidering. It may well bethat successful programs in our own country may when adapted tosuit the overseas political and social contexts, be desirablein other countries. It is crucial that all trials therefore havespecific objectives, clear desired outcomes, and effective, unbiasedevaluation techniques. Many of the strategies overseas, particularlythe English and Dutch models fall down in this regard. CONCLUSION The drug problem in Victoria can only be resolved by looking atthe problems from a holistic perspective. To perceive the drug problem as a law enforcement issue will neverlead to a constructive solution. Only an objective, non partisanapproach that looks at the issue of drug use in its social contextwill provide the answers. There must be an ability to trial newapproaches to drug control as the current prohibitionist approachis fraught with problems. Prohibition only sends the problem underground,increases property crime, violent crime and reduces access torehabilitation and medical services. Prohibition also promotesunsafe practices. Any genuine solution to resolving the drug problem requires adramatic increase in funding for services, the provision of accurateand extensive education, more support for those who are distressed,alienated or distressed, a number of options for rehabilitationthat are accessible. The Federation of Community Legal Centre's submission will beconsidered a bold one but the problems involved for drug usersas we see it (on a daily basis in our work) requires some radicaland well planned and researched measures to be adopted. Otherwise,we will find Victoria facing a higher crime rate, increased costsinvolved in law enforcement ( rather than having money spent onharm minimisation and crime prevention), extensive corruptiondue to the profitability of the black market and an increase incitizens who are alienated and disaffected. Increasing policepowers, curtailing peoples liberties, sending our youth to jailwhere drug usage is widespread will only serve to exacerbate theproblems. Trialing new programs, evaluating them and implementingthe successful ones as indicated in our submission seems to bethe sensible way to go.

The legal rights in this area remain unclear, a person is entitledto take evasive action short of assaulting police) if they take your photographagainst your will. If this happens you should record your complaint with the senior officer,and make it clear that you object to your photograph being taken. THESE ARE THE LAWS RELATING TO FINGERPRINTING You do have to give your fingerprints if you are 15 years old or over,and the police suspect you have committed an offence. You and your parent or guardian must consent to your fingerprintingif you are between 10 and 14 years of age. If they do not agree or cannotbe found the police must ask the Children's Court to make an order allowingthe fingerprinting. You do not have to give your fingerprints if you are under 10 yearsof age. If the police have a warrant they may arrest you for fingerprinting.The police may use reasonable force to take your fingerprints. If you arenot charged, or found guilty, then your fingerprints must be destroyed. Your fingerprints must be destroyed if you do not re-offend beforeturning 26, unless you are charged with murder, manslaughter, assault,rape, sexual offences, robbery, armed robbery or an attempt to commit theseoffences. The police must make sure that an independent person witnesses thefingerprinting. If this does not happen your fingerprints cannot be usedas evidence, except in very special circumstances THESE ARE THE LAWS RELATING TO "FORENSIC PROCEDURE"; A 'forensic procedure' involves taking blood samples, pubic hair orhair, anal, genital, or breast swabs, saliva, mouth or dental impressions,matter under finger or toenails, or other samples or examinations. If you do not agree to such an examination the police are requiredto obtain a court order. The court can order it if the procedure may prove/disproveyour innocence If the court orders a "forensic procedure" the police mayuse reasonable force to assist in obtaining the sample. The court can ordera "forensic procedure" to be carried out on anyone 10 years oldand above. A "forensic procedure" must be done by an authorised person,doctor, or dentist (subject to their availability). You must be informedby police before the forensic procedure, that you do not have to answerany questions asked by the person conducting the procedure, as anythingyou may say may be used against you. If you are aged between 10 and 17years your parents, or an independent person should be present. You should receive a video, if practical, or a tape recording of thetaking of fingerprints, or blood or other bodily samples. You do not have to undergo a "forensic procedure" if youare under 10 years of age. IF THE POLICE BREAK THE LAW Make a complaint to the Internal Investigations Department (ph 4181888) or the Deputy Ombudsman (ph 9670-7151). They will investigate thecomplaint. You can seek the assistance of the lawyers from a Community Legal Centrenear you (see listing on last page). In some circumstances, you can have the evidence which was obtainedby police as a result of behaviour which is illegal, stopped from beingused in court. It is always wise to seek legal advice about a complaint against thepolice. If you are assaulted or physically mistreated you should see adoctor immediately. You should contact a community legal centre and youthworker near you. If the police commit a crime against you, you can apply for compensationand/or take legal action.

Introduction Both the Labor Party and the Coalition have failed to addressthe fundamental issues related to law enforcement and crime prevention. The Labor Party policy, contained in the document "Preventionis Better than Crime", has adopted the language and argumentsof those critical of traditional law enforcement. The policy fails to address crime prevention strategies or foreshadow anysubstantive changes to policing. In the past ten years the Laborgovernment has increased police budgets, powers and resourcessignificantly without evaluating what kind of police servicethe community is getting or putting in place any effective accountabilitymeasures. The Coalition's police policy "A Safer Victoria"offers the community nothing in terms of crime preventionbut instead promises `law and order' through increasing emphasison law enforcement and punishment. Neither the Labor Party nor the Coalition parties have dealt withcurrent police priorities. Presently the police devote significantresources to detecting victimless crimes, which at worst causeonly minor inconvenience to the community, while ignoring seriousviolent crime like domestic violence. To win back the streets, governments need to wake up,see what is happening and acknowledge that there can never bea price placed on Law and Order.... Without honest governmentcommitment, let it be made painstakingly clear that criminalswill continue to gain control of our streets. (Victorian PoliceAssociation President's message, August 1992) Both political parties also fail to confront the reality thatwhilst the police focus their resources and attention on the streetsthe home is the major site for violence and it is estimated that`white collar' crime accounts for more financial loss to the communitythan all other crimes combined. Labor's recent policy statement commits an 8% budget increaseto Australia's most resourced police and an increase in Victoria'spolice numbers to 11,000, despite the fact that per head of populationVictoria has one of the largest police forces in any industrialisedcountry. However even this pledge does not appear to be enoughfor the Police Association. The Coalition has guaranteed to increase police resources by 10%and increase police numbers to 11,000 within their first termof government if elected. This is despite their promiseto cut government spending. Police appear to be a special categorywithin the Coalition's policy framework for a smaller government.Their policy indicates that the only services made freely availableto the disadvantaged will be punishments dished out by police,courts and prisons. Crime prevention can only be achieved when money and policiesare directed to social justice areas such as housing, employment,health, social services etc. The Labor Party policy of increasingthe police budget to accommodate Neighbourhood Watch, Police inSchools and similar types of programs will not prevent crime. Increasing the resources devoted to police and prisons divertsscarce resources from social justice areas without preventingcrime or making the community safer. The diversion of resourcesfrom social justice areas creates greater divisions in societywhich in turn is a source of conflict and violence. It is staggering that in the Labour Party's policy document subtitled"Labor's Strategy to Work Cooperatively with the Policeand the Community to Prevent Crime" virtually no referenceis made to issues of police accountability, nor to the effectupon the criminal justice system, of an increase in police powersand resources. The Coalition parties also lack the sophistication to understandthe clear relationships between policing policies and accountability,and their consequential impact upon the community's access tojustice. It should be of grave concern to all members of the communitythat our political leaders and our political parties have demonstratedsuch an appalling lack of interest and concern in the level ofaccountability being exercised by, and demanded of, an armed forcenow in excess of 10,000 strong in Victoria. This lack of interestin the accountability to the community of such a large armed force represents the greatest single threat to the achievement of amature, nonviolent, and democratic society in which individualscan be confident that they will not be subject to arbitrary justiceand violence at the hands of the police. This report establishes the need for improved accountability bythe Victoria Police and recommends imperative strategies coveringall areas of Police operations, to ensure greater accountabilityto the Victorian community. 2. What Is Offensive Behaviour ? Mr Koravevic was in a good mood on 22nd October 1991. So muchso that as he was caught speeding on his motorbike by a speedcamera, he gestured the well known Australian "One FingerSalute" ! The police officer operating the speed camera found this behaviour" personally offensive" and proceeded to charge Mr Kovacevicwith offensive behaviour in a public place. The Magistrate hearingthe case fined the defendant $100 and recorded a conviction. According to Mr Ian Freckleton from the Council of Civil Liberties; "The time of the police and the courts could be better spent..." The use of police resources and taxpayers money to pursue sucha trivial incident is just one example of a gross double standardexisting between the police and the community they serve. Theoffensive behaviour of our police is not only an abuse of powerentrusted to our police force, but represents the greatest threatto the rights of individuals. 2.1 Police Violence It is the experience of legal centres that violent crimes committedby police contribute significantly to violence in the community.It appears that such violence is becoming more frequent and moreserious. There are a significant number of people in the communitywho are deeply traumatised physically and emotionally by suchabuses and who live in fear and dread of the police. Police violencewhich goes unpunished can lead to disrespect for the law and adesire for revenge on the part of those affected. Police violence is usually hidden. Those who become victims ofpolice attacks or riots have little chance of bringing those policeofficers involved to justice. Usually it is the word of the policeofficers involved against one individual. It is a part of policeculture to stick together and tell lies to protect each othereven under oath at court. People who complain about police treatmentor crimes are often falsely charged and harassed. The current system for making complaints against police is incapableof dealing effectively with violent police. That this is so indicatesthat violence is an accepted part of police culture. Research done by legal centres and other groups documents theprevalent nature of police violence. Those most frequently affectedare vulnerable people who have little chance of defending themselves. * The National Inquiry into Racist Violence heard evidence thatmany of the attacks upon Aborigines, young and old, were perpetratedby police. * Research undertaken in Victoria on homeless young people reportsthat fortyseven per cent of females and fifty per centof males reported being physically hurt by police. * A report on young people and the police found that police weremore likely to be heavyhanded in their dealings with youngmen, Aboriginal youth and marginal youth. These groups were morelikely than other youth to be stopped and spoken to by the police,taken to a police station, and to report being roughed up. * A report by G.L.A.D., Gay men and Lesbians Against Discrimination,describes as "the most disturbing aspect" of the surveythey undertook, the extent to which gay men and lesbians reportedharassment, discrimination and violence at the hands of the police. * A survey undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centresinto police mistreatment included a number of examples of policeassault and sexual abuse of women. The following is a description of what one woman reported happenedto her when she was walking in an area where prostitutes work. "A police car pulled up, asked me what I was doing, andtold me to get in the car. I was taken back to the police station,through a back door, and told to strip. I was questioned whilstI was naked, and police tried to insert an instrument. They thenhit and kicked me". In a separate incident the same woman reported she was standingon the street when.. "Police pulled up in a car and said they had a warrantfor me. They took me to the police station, and to the cellswhere they physically abused me, threw buckets of cold water overme and hit me in the face. They held a gun to my head and pulledthe trigger, though unknown to me, the gun was not loaded". Another woman reported being threatened with rape at a policestation. Evidence was presented to the Inquiry into Racist Violence undertakenby the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which indicatedthat Aboriginal and Islander women and girls have been sexuallythreatened and abused by police officers. Additional police, given the current levels of police violence,will not contribute to making the community safer but will maintainand continue the current police abuse of large numbers of vulnerableand marginalised people by police. 2.2 Police Harassment of Gay Men Police enthusiasm knows no bounds when it comes to policing thegay community. The summary offence "offensive behaviour"is routinely used against gay men frequenting "beats".Police helicopters have been used to swoop down on public toilets.Police chase men in and out of bushes in an attempt to catch `thebuggers in the act' despite the fact that two men engaging inconsensual sex in the privacy of a bush are not committing anoffence at all. Offensive behaviour as defined under section 17of the Summary Offences Act depends on "where that behaviourtook place, and the circumstances in which it took place"(Inglis v Fisher 1961). However, the embarrassment of such charges has lead to most men`caught' pleading guilty. A recent case described in the magazineStar Observer details the use of plain clothes police officersand the calling in of `reinforcements' to apprehend two consentingadults having sex in the bushes late at night. The case went tocourt and was deemed by the Magistrate not to constitute offensivebehaviour. According to gay activist Jamie Gardner; " what the police refuse to accept is that the decisionto chase gay men around the bushes and prosecute is just that:a decision. A decision to spend scarce taxpayers' money persecutinggay men". The Proof Is In The Pudding Crime statistics and policingpractices The Victorian Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research recentlyreleased its 1991/1992 Crime Statistics. One of the strongesttrends revealed by the Bureau is the concentration of police resourceson victimless crimes. On the other hand the statistics, coupledwith the recent study by Dr Rosemary Wearing of Latrobe University,reveal that police turn a blind eye to domestic violence. It is appalling that such a significant proportion of police resourcesare directed to what basically amounts to the harassment of vulnerablegroups while serious criminal assaults directed at women and childrenin the home are ignored. Until policing practices demonstrate a marked change in direction,increased resources will further the abuse of current powers andentrench current policing practices. 3.1 Self appointed Moral Guardians According to the 1991/1992 Victorian Police Statistical Reviewof Crime, police filed charges against 741 people for offencesrelated to prostitution. In comparison 1987/88 figures show 366people were charged. The increase in prostitution related offencesis an example of an increased vigilance in `moral' policing whichis clearly out of step with community attitudes. The charges of soliciting against Bishop Dowling, recently droppedby the DPP were considered "...trivial and involved no victimin any accepted sense", according to Mr Bernard Bongiorno,QC (Sunday Age 30/8/92). The Chairman of the Law Reform Commission Mr David Kelly commented; " The sort of thing alleged against Bishop Dowling doesn'tseem the thing that criminal law should be concerned with. Thereare many more serious crimes. It's most unfortunate that we shouldbother with that". Examples such as these indicate the need to issue police withstricter guidelines and remove the discretion police use to presumea role of `moral policing'. Police training should clearly indicatethat homosexual sex taking place in public, though out of sight,is not considered offensive behaviour at law. Police guidelinesneed to be issued which discourages this type of "moral"policing. The government should indicate to the police in the clearest possibleterms that police budget allocations depend on their efficiencyin dealing with matters of serious concern to the community suchas violence and that scarce resources will not be directed towardsthe persecution and prosecution of vulnerable groups. 3.2 Victimless Crimes According to National Drug Offensive Surveys, the use of drugsin Victoria has remained constant since 1988. However the Bureauof Crime Statistics and Research shows offences relating to Cannabismade up 79% of all drug offences an increase of 31% overthe previous year. Marijuana use is widespread amongst Australians. The targetingof this drug by police as opposed to harder drugs is a misallocationof resources. Further statistics released by the Bureau in August 1992 underminepolice claims for increased resources and powers. The Major CrimeIndex was down by 4.6%, similarly major property crime offenceswere down by 4.7%. The overall rate of major crime against theperson has been stable since 1987/1988. Despite statistical evidence that crime has decreased, policecontinue to argue the existence of an ever increasing crime problem. 3.3 No need but fear While in the past, increasing crime statistics were used to justifyincreased powers, numbers and resources, both political partieshave supported current police claims that an increase in policepresence is needed to alleviate fear over personal safety heldby the public. This is ironic given that the police and the PoliceAssociation significantly contributed to the fear in the firstplace to gain what they wanted from government. The relationship between the police and the media is very closegiven the reliance by journalists on police as their source ofinformation. The police media unit selectively releases detailsabout crimes which support police claims of a `crime problem'.During June 1992, there was significant print media coverage oftwo aggravated burglaries against an elderly couple and an elderlywoman. The media picking up on police terminology defined elderlycitizens as `soft targets'. Despite a decrease in aggravated burglary, the police set up aspecial squad, at substantial cost, to protect `soft targets'even though the role of police intervention occurs after a crimehas been committed. The Director of the Victorian Bureau of CrimeStatistics and Research, Dr David Brereton, told a recent conferenceon violent crime; "...the elderly are a very low risk group, notwithstandinga few highly publicised crimes...the fear of violence is becominga bigger problem than the actual crime itself" As the Chief Commissioner Kel Glare stated recently; " the fear is unjustified for the majority of peoplein the sense that they won't become victims (and) ....given Victoria'srelatively low aggravated burglary statistics." The Coalition's "Safer Victoria" attributes thefear factor to Labor's decade in government. "under Labor Victorians are living in fear" (Pg2) The claim of a 20% rise in burglaries is nothing short of fearmongering. What the Coalition omits to say is that burglariesare down by 6.8% for 199192. Regarding living in fear, it is probably of little comfort tothe Coalition that homicide offences have decreased by 20%, inparticular the number of murders have fallen by 28.2%. Whilecrime statistics show fraudulent offences are down by 6.3% theOpposition would have us believe that they have quadrupled. (Pg2) 4. `Women's Place' Within Policing Priorities According to Victoria's Kirner government; " if violence is to be reduced, action is required tochange community attitudes and behaviour as well as equip thepolice to apprehend and convict perpetrators of violence againstwomen, children and older people". Labor's recently released Law and Order policy makes a commitment" .... to properly resource the police so that society isbetter protected from violent offenders". In the case of domestic violence, police resourcing does not correlatewith protect ion of women from violent offenders. Policereluctance to take out Intervention Orders is born out by 19901991court monitoring statistics which show police acted as complainantsin only 3.42% of applications for Intervention Orders. According to Labor's policy statement; " Police have always given priority to crimes of violenceinvolving women and children". This is simply not true! Such a statement is an insult to thosethousands of women who have expressed their deep disappointmentat the lack of police assistance and those women in refuges, women'sand community organisations who have battled for over a decadeto change the police response to domestic violence. The following case examples are daily occurrences for women'srefuges, women's services and community legal centres: Case Examples Margaret had been seriously assaulted by her partner. Police toldher there was enough evidence to lay assault charges. She thoughtthey were going to lay charges against him. When she contacted the station a couple of days later, they saidshe'd told them not to charge him. This was incorrect. The police then told Margaret that it was his word against hersand if he didn't get convicted they would have to pay costs. Shirley was severely beaten by Phillip who pushed her head througha wall and attempted to strangle her. The police attended andtook both Shirley and Phillip to the station to be interviewed.They sent Phillip home without charging him and threatened tocharge Shirley with use of a drug of addiction. ( She had notbeen using illegal drugs but was on a Methadone program.) Theyalso subjected her to considerable verbal abuse. Shirley had an Intervention Order against Philip. Other police who Shirley had contact with a few days later wereso concerned about her injuries that they had her photographedby the police photographer and have stated that they are goingto charge Phillip. These examples are not isolated incidents but highlightwidespread police inaction. Unfortunately there are many examplesof police not prioritising and not responding to incidents ofviolence against women. 4.1 Police Culture Police attitudes and behaviour when answering calls to domesticviolence endangers women's lives. One third of homicides are `domestic'.Police behaviour contributes significantly to a situation wherethousands of women and children every year are forced to fleetheir homes because of serious criminal abuse at the hands oftheir partners or ex partners. Victorian women and children deservefar more from the police. A government which does not confrontpolice behaviour in these areas is failing in their commitmentto protect vulnerable women and children from widespread maleviolence in the home. `Prevention is better than Crime' states ; " Police are trained to view violence in the home ascriminal assault" (P24). At present the Family Violence Prevention Unit shares 1.38% ofthe total police budget with neighbourhood watch, coordinationof community policing squads, child exploitation investigation,and liaison work with ethnic, aboriginal and gay communities.What is essential to improving police attitudes is `tied' resourcesto the training of police on the issue of domestic violence anda more appropriate budget allocation to the area of domestic violence. 4.2 Police intervention = savings to society Cost effectiveness is increasingly part of evaluating public servicesand government departments. The economic costs to society in respondingto domestic violence (ie policing, emergency housing, courts etc.)are substantial. Intervention which prevents a perpetrator fromcommitting further offences is not only cost effective from apolicing point of view but also in terms of a cost/benefit gainfor society, particularly women. " Arrest is an important strategy of intervention indomestic violence. Arrest of the assailant provides the womenwith immediate protection from further assault.....(it has) adeterrent affect in domestic assault and is more powerful thanwarning or mediation". A policy statement encouraging police to use their powers in interveningand taking action in domestic violence situations is more effectivein `preventing' domestic violence than any increase in policeresources. Not only do police fail to initiate Intervention Ordersbut they are also reluctant to press charges. Very few breachesof Intervention Order charges are made by police. Case example Aida's husband threatened to "blow my brains away".When she called the police they said "we prefer to see scars first.......maybe you can sortthings out" Not to enforce the law or to treat threat to life lightly makesthe police complicit with the offender, as their (in)actions serve to protect the offender not the victim. 4.3 Where's the accountability for police discretion? The following example is taken from a series of case studies compiledby one community lawyer at a Melbourne Legal Centre: Mr J aged 23 years. Mr J sustained brain damage as a result ofan accident when he was 10 years old. Mr J has been charged withnumerous incidents of false reports to police. One matter is nowpart heard awaiting reports from Intellectual Disability Servicesand Corrective Services. In addition to these matters, to which Mr J intends to plead guilty,he has been subject to scrutiny by local police. Charges for failureto wear a bike helmet and obscene language have also been laid. Where is the accountability in police using time and resourcesto prosecute Mr J whilst ignoring calls for help as made by Aida?How can a policy document be taken seriously when there is nostatement addressing the long term problems of police not respondingto domestic violence as a crime? 4.4 Coalition Policy The Coalition's Police policy (released 15/9/92) makes no statementon the role of police regarding domestic violence. We are toldthere will be `support for women to enable them to leave violentrelationships' (P 11). Does the Coalition need to be remindedthat women have nowhere to go as refuges are overflowing withwaiting lists months long ? In short, there is no undertaking by the Coalition's policy toaddress the problem of police attitudes and inaction regardingthe safety of women in domestic violence situations. The `user pays' principle is central to the Coalitions FederalFightback package. It provides a guide to what a Victorian Coalitiongovernment will ascribe to the family ideal; the approachto industrial relations; public service cutbacks. These will inturn affect the `private' sphere of women's lives. Up front feeswithin the `user pays' scheme will impact on quality of life issuesfor women in terms of health costs and access to education andtraining opportunities. Women's economic status will be negativelyaffected by the free market approach of a Coalition government. `Smaller government' means " a reduction in the governmentservices for which women have struggled throughout the centuryand which are also an important source of employment for women." Women caught in economically dependent relationships will havefewer choices when trapped in a violent relationship. 4.5 Where Is Prevention Best Placed ? What we don't hear the police or political parties talking aboutis the marked increase in reporting of sexual assault cases, whichis up by 23.4% Despite this increase, sexual assault is stillone of the most underreported crimes and holds one of the lowestclearance rates. The funding of sexual assault services has certainlynot kept pace with the increase in reporting keeping inmind that services see many more women who choose not to reportto the police. If the Labor party is serious about its policy`Prevention is Better Than Crime', then increased resources shouldgo to where prevention is being undertaken within CentresAgainst Sexual Assault. The programs, education and training being undertaken by theseCentres to change attitudes which condone and perpetuate violenceagainst women is in the true sense of the word working towards`prevention' and elimination of this prevalent violent crime.To fund increases in the police budget whilst sexual assault servicescannot meet demands is a gross misallocation of financial resources. 5. Who Are The Police Accountable To ? 5.1 Complaints Against Police Despite many public comments by police officers to the effectthat they do not oppose, and in fact would support independentinvestigations of police complaints, their treatment of the PoliceComplaints Authority established in Victoria during the mid 1980'smakes it clear that they in fact vigorously oppose any independentinvestigation of complaints against police.<D%0> The community is very cynical about the continued investigationof Caesar by Caesar. Under the current system the great majorityof the complaints about police are in fact investigated not bythe Internal Investigations Department nor the Deputy Ombudsmanbut by police from the same district which the officer complainedabout comes from. The experience of legal centres indicates thatoften police investigate those for whom they have a direct lineof responsibility, which clearly compromises the independenceof the investigation. The failure of the current government and the opposition coalitionparties to address this most fundamental issue of accountabilityindicates just how far political parties in Victoria have gonein compromising the interests of the community in favour of theinterests of this armed force. 5.2 Independent Community Visitors Scheme Despite the fact that a huge number of complaints about mistreatmentby police relate to events that take place in police stations,none of the political parties in Victoria have been prepared toaddress the need for a preventative independent accountabilitymechanism for the operation of police stations. The development of an independent community visitors scheme withpowers to randomly visit police stations, to protect the rightsof individuals in custody is urgent. The establishment of independentcommunity visitors schemes covering all police stations in Victoriais in the interests of the police, members of the public takeninto police custody, and the Victorian community in general. Thisapproach of making the police directly accountable to the communitythat they are serving, which has already been implemented in England,is in direct contrast to the current trend towards developingPolice stations that look more like fortresses, and the widespreadattitude of police that they are not to be held accountable forwhat happens in police stations. 5.3 Strip Searches And Photographs In contrast to the move towards controls over police powers regardingfingerprints and blood samples, which are now under some limitedindependent accountability through the Magistrates' Courts, therehas been no legislative protection introduced in relation to stripsearches, internal body searches, frisktype searches, orthe taking of photographs of individuals being investigated by the police. The failure of the government to addressthese fundamental issues of accountability in relation to themost basic of all human rights, namely the protection and dignityof our bodies, indicate just how badly out of touch our politiciansare in regard to the routine procedures adopted by police in thisstate. The Coalition policy states that police will have the right to"following the consent of a Magistrate conduct a body search.....withthe assistance of a medical practitioner". Whilst we do not believe this goes far enough to protect the communityit is a small step in the right direction. Unfortunately in otherareas the Coalition have removed all requirements for accountabilityfrom the police. 5.4 Exercise Of Police Powers The extensive powers given to the Victoria Police represent asubstantial privilege that has been bestowed upon them by therest of the community. There are no systematic accountability procedures in place toensure that these privileges are properly exercised and to counterthe institutionalised abuse of powers that has developed withinthe Victoria Police. The legislation granting rights to peoplein police custody provides no penalties against police officerswho abuse those rights and no other mechanism is available toeffectively complain. There are no penalties imposed on police officers in relationto the denial of rights given to members of the community. Thisbasic level of accountability is exactly what police are demandingfor other members of the community who breach the law and fundamentalhuman rights. There is an urgent need for regular independent audits of theexercise of all Victorian police powers, in particular powersrelating to the following: (a) Refusal of Bail Far too many people are being placed on bail unnecessarily inrelation to summary offences. (b) The taking of fingerprints There has been an increase in excess of 50% in the number of fingerprintsbeing taken by Victoria Police since the introduction of the newlegislation in March 1990. The coalition policy to give policeunlimited power to forcefully take fingerprints and name and addresswill further reduce police accountability and increase the abuseof community members at the hands of police, whilst having noimpact on crime prevention and solution. The Shadow Minister for Police, Mr McNamara has indicated hispreference for a fingerprinting system where persons charged areautomatically fingerprinted and; "if not convicted the onusis on the person to request to have the prints destroyed". (c) Search Warrants Search warrants are issued far too easily, and in some circumstancesmembers of the public complain of being presented with unsignedsearch warrants or warrants authorising searches of premises otherthan the one the police wish to search. (d) The taking of blood and other body samples Although body samples are not often taken, and are subject tosome independent scrutiny of the Magistrates' Court, an auditand assessment of the use of this power is also necessary in theinterest of an efficient and accountable police force. (e) Preliminary breath testing Although a reasonably well accepted procedure by the community,a careful audit of this power needs to be undertaken on a regularbasis, particularly in relation to charges of refusal to takea breath test, where there are allegations of abuse by the police. (f) Questioning & Police Custody The length of time which people are detained in police custodyfor the purposes of questioning should be strictly monitored toensure that the most basic of individual rights, i.e. not to beunnecessarily detained, is protected. Special attention must begiven to situations where people are held in police detentionfor questioning and either no charges, or charges for offencesagainst the police officers, namely hindering, resisting arrest,and assaulting police are laid. (g) Legal Representation Although provision is made in the Crimes Act foran individual's right to contact a legal representative the provisionof legal advice by a solicitor when arrested must be made mandatory,as is the case in other democratic societies. Currently if policeact in accordance to the law a suspect will be permitted to telephonea lawyer. Such a right is only of use to those persons who havetwentyfour hour access to a legal representative. Thereis an urgent need for a twentyfour hour legal service availableto all persons held in police custody. This mandatory right shouldapply irrespective age, race or background. h) The provision of interpreters There is no proper accountability required of police in relationto the provision of interpreters for people from a nonenglishspeaking background who do not have a sufficient command of English.Studies in the area have shown that police are very reluctantto use interpreters, and the only accountability applied to policeis if the Record of Interview is challenged in a later court proceeding. There are no adequate records kept indicating the adequacy ofpolice use of interpreters, and no clear guidelines requiringthe police to make use of interpreters. (i) Independent Third persons The use of Independent Third Persons in situations where the personin custody for questioning and investigation is under the ageof 17, or has an intellectual or mental impairment, also requiresproper accountability to be developed to ensure that police complywith the legal requirements in this area. The situation in relationto people with intellectual or mental impairments needs to begiven legislative protection, with proper guidelines being developedfor police to guide them in the exercise of this power, and tomonitor the implementation of the power. (j) Truncheons, handcuffs and water cannons? There are no adequate accountability procedures in relation tothe use by the Victoria Police of various items of equipment carriedby them as a matter of course. Police must be held accountablefor the use of handcuffs, truncheons and other items used fordetention or forceful arrest or entry. These items have been providedto our police force as part of the responsibility and privilegeaccorded to police officers because of their unique role in society. The failure by the government and opposition parties to addressaccountability of the police use of these items has allowed anattitude to develop in the police force that police will not beheld accountable for the use of these items no matter how inappropriatelythey might be used. To be unreasonably or improperly detained in handcuffs or beatenby police batons is a criminal offence regardless of whether theperson carrying out the action is or is not a police officer.Police must be made accountable to ensure that this equipmentis only used when necessary and required by the situation. The Liberal National Party Coalition have suggested that watercannons be available to police to use at demonstrations. Thisis an appalling prospect. Victorian's have the right to demonstratein the streets. Current laws and levels of police resources aremore than adequate to deal with demonstrators should they commitany unlawful acts. 5.5 Gun Control & Police Firearms Labor is to be congratulated on its efforts to control the numberof weapons in the community. It is also necessary for the governmentto ensure that police officers do not endanger themselves or thecommunity by frequent and unnecessary resort to firearms. In the two years between 1987 and 1989 Victoria Police shot andkilled eleven citizens. In ten out of these eleven shootings thepolice were not themselves being shot at. In at least seven outof the eleven shootings the deceased either did not have a gunor did not have a gun capable of firing. Four of those shot andkilled were shot in the back, three dying of bullet wounds tothe back of the head. Due to the number of shootings and their controversial circumstancesthe Coroner has conducted a lengthy investigation into seven ofthem. He is due to make findings about seven of these shootingsin November of this year. The accidental firing of guns by police or deliberate dischargeof guns in circumstances that endanger the public are events whichoccur with alarming regularity. For example: * When police attempted to arrest a suspect for questioning theyfired seven shots in a public car park on a weekday afternoon. The detective in charge of the operation did not check whetherthere were any civilians in the car park before attempting thearrest, although he expected a shoot out. The police shot andkilled the suspect during this incident and the Coroner held aninquest. The father of a two year old girl told the Coroner thathis daughter was in a car in the car park when the police openedfire and he believed that the police tactics had endangered hisdaughter's life. * A police officer fired six shots in a busy street at a fleeingmotorist; one shot landed between two teenage girls sitting ona couch in their home. * In his 1990 annual report, the Ombudsman described an incidentin which a mother and baby narrowly missed being shot when anofficer accidentally fired his revolver during a raid. * A police officer was accidentally shot in the foot by a colleagueat Altona police station. * Officers have been shot and killed or wounded by other policeduring raids. * A man and his two children narrowly escaped serious injurywhen a shot accidentally fired from a police officer's gun hittheir car. Only luck has prevented bystanders from being wounded or killedby police bullets. The Leader of the Opposition Mr Jeff Kennett has argued that armedguards in Parliament would be offensive and he would ban the carryingof firearms by security officers inside Parliament and the TreasuryPlace offices of the Premier, if he won government. If parliamentarians are to be spared the sight of armed guardswhy should other Victorian's be subjected to the sight of the10,000 odd police officers, many of them still teenagers, whopatrol the streets with guns on their hips? Most adult Victorian's,who grew up in the city, never saw a real gun as children. Ourown children see guns every day of the week carried by police.For many parents trying to raise their children with an attitudethat rejects violence as a means of solving problems these gunsand their prominent display are an affront. Any policy which purports to address the issue of public safetyand gun control must address the way that 10,000 armed policeuse their firearms. 5.6 Specialist Squads There has been increasing concern raised about the operationsof specialist squads such as the Major Crime squad (now disbanded),the Armed Robbery squad, the Asian squad, and the Special Operationsgroup. None of the major political parties in Victoria have addressedthe need for the review of the existence of these squads and forthe implementation of effective and strict accountability of anyspecialist squads that are considered necessary. These specialist squads are able to act in a total void of accountabilityto the outside community and to the parliament of Victoria. Thenature of complaints about the operations of these squads indicatethat even the most senior levels of police management have verylittle control over the operations of these sections of the policeforce. It is the clear impression in legal centres based on complaintsmade to us that these squads have become a law unto themselves. Community Legal Centres have seen too many people whose treatmentat the hands of these squads can best be described as torture.The methods used by these squads are of far greater danger tothe community than most of the people against whom they directtheir ruthless tactics. 5.7 Police Training None of the major political parties in Victoria have adequatelyaddressed the issue of police training. No reference is made to training and recruitment policy in theCoalition's policy document. Instead it is intended that off dutyand retired police will be able to pick up extra cash doing unidentifiedjobs. The Victorian Labor Party Policy Statement proudly announces that; "Recruits now go through a 19 week training course beforebeginning formal on the job training which continues for two years." This in fact reflects the status quo as it has been for manyyears, and is patently inadequate. Whilst police in Victoria have made substantial gains in pay andother benefits over the last decade very little work has beendone to ensure that they receive adequate training in relationto dealing with young people, dealing with people from diverseethnic and cultural backgrounds, and the development of more sophisticatedand less confrontational tactics when dealing with the public. The 19 week training course currently provided to Victorian policeofficers is grossly inadequate and despite significant increasesin budgetary allocations over the past 10 years, the VictoriaPolice have not chosen to give high priority to training. 5.8 Access To Justice None of the major political parties in Victoria have addressedthe effect of increased police powers and resources on accessto justice and the criminal justice system as a whole. The Legal Aid Commission has had to refuse almost 30% of legalaid applications for the period ending 30th June 1992 comparedto 20% for the period ending 30th June 1991. Whilst 85% of legalaid recipients are living below the poverty line, many peopleunable to afford legal costs are not receiving any legal assistancedue to more stringent legal aid guidelines. The Legal Aid Commission has had to increasingly reject applicationsdue to significant budgetary constraints. Under the Commonwealth State Legal Aid funding agreement the state is requiredto provide 45% of the Commission's income. Interest from the SolicitorsGuarantee Fund has largely met the State's financial obligationin the past. With the Solicitors Guarantee Fund and interest ratesat an all time low, the state government has had to dip into itspurse to provide legal aid funds. However, Government fundinghas not kept pace with the increasing cost of cases due theirincreased complexity and length. People facing criminal charges in Victoria are now regularly beingrefused legal aid even when they have a very sound defence tothe charge against them, on the grounds that they are unlikelyto go to gaol or receive substantial fines. These people are notin a position to be able to afford the cost of legal representationout of their own pocket, and are pleading guilty and being convictedsimply because they have no means by which to present their caseto the courts. The number of people appearing before Magistrates' Courts withoutthe benefit of legal representation is rising dramatically probablyfor the first time since the development of community legal centresin the early 1970's and the creation of legal aid commissionsin the early 80's. The failure of any of the political parties to address the directcorrelation between the impact on the demand for legal aid andincreased police resources and powers is a clear indication thatthose parties no longer have any genuine commitment to justicein our community and have become slaves to the political pressurebeing applied by the Victoria Police. Legal Aid impact statements must be prepared detailing the effecton legal aid services, the court system and the corrections systemof any increase in police powers and resources, and appropriatefunding must be made available to ensure that the other partsof our criminal justice system are able to adequately deal withthe flowon effect of these changes. 5.9 On The Spot Fines Labor states that they will introduce on the spot fines for awider range of offences. It is said that this will relieve thework load of the police and the court system. In the 199091financial year the Victoria Police collected $35 million in onthe spot fines. Many Victorian's are faced with heavy fines of this nature ata time when they are suffering great economic hardship. The fineshave vastly different impacts on different people because theytake no account of a persons income or ability to pay. Another offensive aspect of these fines is that ordinary peoplehave no hope of challenging them once they have been issued. Manypeople complain that some police officers incorrectly or unfairlyissue such fines. It is not possible to get legal aid to challenge the fines andmost people are not confident enough to put their story at courtwithout legal representation and with the risk of receiving aneven higher fine. It is true that on the spot fines save policeand court time but at the high cost to freedom of making policeofficers judge and jury, and ultimately at the cost to individual'sfreedom. 6. Recommendations 6.1 Development Of Local Police Accountability The Victoria Police has progressively become more isolated andalienated from its local communities. Attempts at community policeliaison and developments such as police community consultativecommittees (P.C.C.C.) have generally not been successful becauselocal communities have viewed these developments as police controlledpublic relations exercises rather than genuine attempts to developaccountability to local communities. These local committees havenever possessed any real decision making powers, and on occasionshave been subject to directions higher in the police force quashinglocal community initiatives aimed at developing local accountability. There can be no substitute for the development of real accountabilityof police to their local communities. What is needed is localmanagement committees with real powers to direct the use of policeresources available to their community, including the prioritisingof police work in the prevention and detection of crime withinthat community. Clearly appropriate guidelines need to be established for theoperation of community management structures for police. Muchwork needs to be done to ensure that these management committeesare appropriately resourced. These committees should be providedwith guidelines, developed in consultation with the community,that balance the need to protect individuals rights from unnecessaryinterference and arrest, against the need of the community toimplement effective crime prevention and an adequate responsewhen crime does occur. It is shameful that none of the major political parties in Victoriahave addressed the widening gap between police and the local communities.The future safety of our community requires a move away from policeofficers barricaded from the community by roller doors, high securityfences, and motor vehicle windows two thirds closed. These imagestell the community that the police do no trust the communityand therefore are not to be trusted themselves. The development of local community management structures mustnot be left in the hands of the police force, but rather withthe appropriate input from bodies such as the Law Reform Commission,Ethnic Communities, Womens Groups, Youth Organisations and local government to name a few of the obvious participants. While the Coalition Parties and the current government are rushingto give Victorians more police, with more powers and more communityalienating equipment, little recognition has been given to theincreasing alienation and distrust of police because of theirlack of accountability. Real accountability does not come fromwords in political policy documents but from appropriately developedcommunity structures. What is required in Victoria is a radical rethink of the directionin which our police force is going and the way in which our policeare held accountable to local communities. 6.2 Accountability Of Senior Police Management The lack of accountability and the increasing politicisation ofthe Victoria police in recent years has alerted many Victoriansto the need for an independent management committee to overviewPolice. This committee would need to be directly accountable to the Ministerand Parliament for all aspects of the operation of the Police.The composition of this committee needs to be developed in carefulconsultation with all political parties with advise from appropriategovernment departments, community organisations, and managementconsultants. The make up of such an independent management committeeshould be at least 70% non police personnel. The Labor Party policy applauds the value of independence of theVictoria Police from the executive arm of government. Their policydocument points to the experience of the police force in Queenslandas revealed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry, and rejects the KennettOpposition's proposal for a Police Board on the grounds that itwill reduce the independence of the Chief Commissioner and bea source of political interference. These statements ignore the development of a politicised policeforce in Victoria over the last decade. These comments and a referenceto the need for internal investigations to be monitored by theDeputy Ombudsman, are about the only comments the Labor GovernmentPolicy has to make in relation to police accountability. The Opposition parties, whilst proposing a Police Board have givenvery little substance on which to evaluate their proposal, andlike the Labor government have totally ignored the wide rangeof other issues associated with the appalling lack of police accountabilityin Victoria. 7. Conclusion Both political parties offer no commitment to directing policingpractices and priorities towards a crime prevention frameworkwith appropriate accountability mechanisms. Policy statementsare meaningless without an honest appraisal of what needs to beimproved. Both Labor and the Coalition have opted for electionmanifestos which avoid tackling the real issues in achieving crimeprevention and law enforcement. Whilst Labor does acknowledge a `social context' to crime, theCoalition does not even attempt to state why crime occurs. Theapproach of the Opposition to the role of police amounts to littlemore than an elementary lesson on respecting the law. The noticeably`thin' Safer Victoria espouses a traditional approach topolicing and a paternalistic attitude of encouraging `trust' inour force. This sets the tone for a document which at best isnaive and at worst dangerous. With the current lack of police accountability the impact of budgetincreases of 8% under Labor and 10% under the Coalition in termsof increased numbers, powers and resources will ensure that moreand more people will experience the kind of abuse at the handsof the police that we have come to associate with military regimesor police states. Community legal centres are already seeing people whose basicfaith, that we may live in a society where these type of abusesare not allowed to occur, has been shattered. That knowledge ofthese abuses is not more widespread is due in part to the wilfulignorance of politicians who refuse to heed the warning signsand a media that to a large extent is successfully managed bythe million dollar police media liaison bureau. The failure of the major political parties in Victoria to addressthe important issue of accountability of a major government departmentwith an annual budget in excess of $600 million and which representsan armed force of over 10,000 individuals raises serious questionsabout the relationship between politicians and police in the stateof Victoria. That it is left to the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic.)to raise these fundamental issues of accountability is a shamefulindictment of the political parties and politicians in the stateof Victoria.

The Federation of Community Legal Centres Victoria P.O. Box 1139K GPO Melbourne 3000 Victoria Australia Tel: 61 03 9602 4949 Fax: 61 03 9602 4948 Disclaimer:The Views Expressed in this paper may or may not be supportedby the Fitzroy Legal Service. Inference as to the degree of supportor otherwise as offered by the Fitzroy Legal Service as an organizationor its staff or volunteers should not be drawn. In the decade from 1981/82 to 1990/91 expenditure by Victorianson their police force has increased by 135.3%, exceeding the CPIinflation rate for the same period by 27.9%. At the beginning of this decade, the Victorian Police programoutlays were $235,707,000. By the end of the decade they hadreached $554,505,000, an increase of almost $319,000,000. This represents an average of $31.9 million additional expenditureon police by Victorians each year for the past 10 years. At a time of increasing concern about the operation and managementof Victoria Police, when the economy is in severe recession, unemploymentat its highest levels for 60 years, and amidst claims that theState of Victoria is bankrupt, it is necessary to question whetherthe increased expenditure on the Victoria Police can be justifiedby the results achieved. In terms of police manpower, Victorians have obtained an additional1,612 police officers for their extra $319,000,000 outlayed in1990/91. This represents a 19.09% increase in police officers during thedecade. In 1981/82 8,444 people held the special privilege, responsibilityand powers that Victorians give to their police officers. By1990/91 this number had grown to 10,056. For each year in the past decade, Victorians have gained 161.2additional police officers on average per year, at an averageyearly cost of $31.9 million. On the basis of these figures, it can be seen that each additionalpolice officer has cost Victorians $197,890 per police officerper year. At an average annual price tag of nearly $200,000 peryear. Any decision to increase police numbers must be very carefullyconsidered. In 1981/82 policing cost each Victorian $59.38. In 1990/91 weeach pay $125.56 per year for our police. At the end of this10 year period each one of us has to find an additional $66.18each year to pay for our police force. In 1990/91 the Victorian Police spent 33.3% of their total budgeton Corporate Services. In contrast, expenditure on local policestations, known as Community Based Policing in the police budget,represented 49.8% of total Expenditure with a further 1.38% beingspent on Operations Support Services. Operation Support Services covers such things as the FirearmsRegistry, State Bicycle Co-ordination, Neighbourhood Watch, Policein Schools, Co-ordination of Community Policing Squads, childexploitation investigation and family violence, as well as liaisonwith ethnic Aboriginal and gay communities. All of these itemsshared 1.38% of Victoria Police expenditure in 1990/91. Major crimes are dealt with under Program 591 and accounted for8.11% of Victoria Police expenditure in 1990/91 under the heading"Crime Investigation". Program 591 also deals withTraffic and Operations Support which accounted for 7.41% of VictoriaPolice expenditure in 1990/91. Although much has been made of the supposed explosion in criminalactivity in our society, a study of the official crime statisticskept by the Victoria Police actually reveals a substantially differentstory. In looking at these figures, we should also bear in mindthat there has been much criticism of the way in which policein Victoria compile and define their crime statistics. Victoria'sAttorney General, Mr Jim Kennan, was quoted in the "SundayAge" of 29 March 1992 as saying: "A major crime indexis a major problem. It is extraordinarily misleading. .....Police and criminal justice agencies had a vested interestin creating the impression of a crime wave.....The temptationis if you want more resources you play up the blood and violence." If we put the arguments about the accuracy and reliability ofthe Police Major Crime Statistics, and accept the fact that anindependent body has been created, the Bureau of Criminal Statistics,to analyse and report on crime statistics in the future, we canstill see that the hysteria being generated around "the crimeexplosion" is ill informed and misleading. Relying upon the raw Victoria Police Major Crime Stats, we seethat there is an apparently large increase in major crime in thedecade from 1981/82 to 1990/91. Total major crime reported tothe police in 1981/82 was 175,518 and in 1990/91 it was 320,604(note that Victoria Police changed from calendar year to financialyear recording of crime statistics at the end of 1983). This represents, without allowing for growth input relation, anincrease in major crime reported of approximately 83% over thedecade. However, if we look at the last five years of the decade from1986/87 to 1990/91, we will see that the total major crime reportedto the Victoria Police has increased by only 13.02%. Total majorcrime reports in 1986/87 was 283,666 and in 199091 it was 320,604. This increase does not allow for growth in population. By allowing for increases in population growth, based on informationprovided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for Victoria,the major crimes reported to Victoria Police increased from 44.2per every thousand people in 1981/82 to 72.6 per every thousandpeople in 1990/91. This represents a 64.25% increase in majorcrime reported per capita over the 10 year period. However, if we look at the last five years of the decade, we willsee that there has been an increase of only 7.07% in major crimesreported to police in Victoria, allowing for a growth in the population. In anyone's terms, an increase of just over 7% in major crimesreported to police over the last five years hardly representsa major blowout in criminal activity as many would have us believe. If we turn to the issue of major crimes committed against persons,we can see that at the end of the decade, 1990/91, in a crowdof 100,000 at the MCG to watch the grand final, only 157 are likelyto have been the victims of some form of violent crime duringthe previous 12 months. The players on the other side of thefence would almost certainly have had a much greater chance ofserious physical injury as a result of playing football for thepast 12 months. The number of major crimes against the person have risen from4,010 in 1981/82 to 6,946 in 1990/91. By allowing for the increasein Victoria's population over the decade, this represents an increaseof approximately 55% over the 10 year period. However, if we look at the last five years from 1986/87, we willsee that the increase in major crimes against the person has beenonly 12.14% allowing for population increase in the five yearperiod. Again this cannot be seen in anyone's terms as a majorcrime explosion. Although it is of no consolation for those people who are thevictims of major crime against the person, the fact is that thosecrimes represent only 2.16% of all major crime, as defined bythe Victoria Police, reported during 1990/91. As a percentageof all offences reported to police during 1990/91, these majorcrimes against the person were only 1.57% of the total. In contrast to major crimes against the person, very minor offences(defined as "other offences" in police crime statistics)represented 27.14% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91,up from 24.01% in 1986/7. Allowing for population increase, minoroffences have increased from 21.4 offences per 1,000 people in1986/7 to 27.0 offences per 1,000 people in 1990/91. This representsa 26.16% increase in minor offences in real terms during thisperiod. This is more than four times the increase in "majorcrime" for the same period. Victoria is experiencing a majorblowout in minor offences and not a crime wave. Stealing, not including burglary and theft of motor vehicles,represented 30.21% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91. The second largest category of all offences reported to policewas "other offences" (summary offences ranging fromindecent language through to resist police and bill posting) whichrepresented 27.14% of all offences reported in 1990/91. Thus nearly 60% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91related to either minor summary offences or allegations of stealing. The big four in terms of number of offences reported to Victorian Police in 1990/91 were: 1. Theft          - 30.21% of total offences reported.2. Other Offences - 27.14% "    "      "       "3. Burglary       - 21.39% "    "      "       "4. Fraud          - 11.55% "    "      "       " The big four represent 9 out of 10 of all offences reported tothe Victoria Police in 1990/91. Another disturbing aspect of police response to crime in Victoriais the very high over representation of juveniles (defined aspersons aged 8-16 years) in the figures for those people takento court for major offences. In 1990/91 juveniles represented 26.57% of all offenders proceededagainst in the major crime classification, and yet representedonly 11% of the population of Victoria. In relation to minor offences, juveniles represented 11.83% ofthose proceeded against which corresponds to their representationamongst the general population. The over-representation of juveniles proceeded against in relationto "major crime" is more concerning when recognitionis given to the fact that juvenile criminal activity is largelyin the area of minor property offences and not major propertyoffences or offences against the person. These figures suggest that police are targeting young people whoare highly visible, easy to apprehend and obtain convictions againstwhilst ignoring serious crime and those responsible for it. Far from living in a violent society, these figures tell us thatpeople are committing crimes out of either need or greed. Giventhe high levels of unemployment, the depth of the current recessionand the general gloominess being experienced by Victorians today,it is reasonable to suppose that need is playing a large partin the level of criminal offences being reported to police.

FEDERATION OF COMMUNITY LEGAL CENTRES REPORT INTO MISTREATMENT BY POLICE 1991-92 Written by: S.Biondo (Community Development Officer-Fitzroy Legal Service) and D.Palmer (Lecturer, Legal Studies Department-LaTrobe University), with the assistance of the Federation of Community Legal Centres Police Issues Working Group. Prepared for the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic.) Police Issues Group, May 1993 Table of Contents Executive Summary Recommendations Other Recommendations Overview Introduction Purpose: Objectives Methodology Principal Findings 1.0 Characteristics of Respondents and Incidents 2.0 Police Behaviour 3.0 Details About the Outcome of the Incident PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The principal findings of the study are presented under the following categories: 1.0 Characteristics of respondents and incidents; 2.0 Police behaviour; and 3.0 Details about the outcome of the incident. Each section will be followed by a brief summary of the results. Finally the data is analysed and recommendations are made based on the findings of the survey. 1.0 CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONDENTS AND INCIDENTS Information was collected about respondents gender, age, place of residence, occupation, country of birth, Aboriginality, language, prior police mistreatment of respondents and the time and place of incidents. Detailed tables are in Appendix 3. 1.1 Gender of Respondents 71% of respondents were male, 28% female (see Appendix 3. Table 3.1.1). 1.2 Age of Respondents 27% of respondents were between 17 and 20 years old and 64% were aged under 30 years (see Appendix 3 Table 3.1.2). 1.3 Address of Respondents Respondents addresses identified 61 postcode areas, a concentration of metropolitan and outer metropolitan addresses with a spread throughout rural regional centres and outlying country areas. Flemington, Footscray and North Melbourne were most frequent (see Appendix 3 Table 3.1.3). 1.4 Occupation of Respondent Over one third of respondents were unemployed, and a further 32% were either students or pensioners. This means that at least three quarters of all respondents had no work (see Appendix 3 Table 3.1.4). 1.5 Country of Birth Some 69% of respondents were born in Australia. No respondents indicated that they were Koori. Nineteen other countries of birth were identified, with Vietnam 9.5%, the United Kingdom 5.3% and New Zealand, 3.2% having the largest numbers. Each of the following countries was also represented: Malaysia, El Salvador, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Argentina, Ethiopia, Holland, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Sweden and the United States (see Appendix 3 Table 3.1.5). 12% of respondents preferred to speak a language other than English. Of these a total of 18 individuals preferred to speak Vietnamese with the remaining languages being Laotian, Kymer, Thai, Spanish and Macedonian. 1.6 Previous Police Mistreatment. At least 49% of the respondents indicated that they had previously been mistreated by the police (see Appendix 3 Table 3.1.6). Of these respondents who had been previously mistreated, 23% indicated that they had made a formal complaint on a previous incident of mistreatment. 1.7 Place of Incident Incidents reported by respondents occurred most frequently in St Kilda, Footscray and Flemington (see Appendix 3 Table 3.1.7). 1.8 Time of incident Over half of the reported incidents occurred between 5.00pm and 9.00am., a further one third occurred between 9.00am and 5.00pm (see Appendix 3 Table 3.1.8). Analysis according to normal police shift times shows that 49% of incidents occurred during afternoon shift, that is between 3.00pm and 11.00pm. and a further 30% occurred during day shift, between 7.00am and 3.00pm 1.9 SUMMARY The typical victim who responded in the 1992 survey is a male, under the age of 30. He is likely to reside in the greater metropolitan area of Melbourne and not to be in the paid workforce. Over one third of respondents have been previously mistreated by the police and one third stated that they were born overseas. While language is not a problem for many respondents it affected almost half of those who indicated that they were born overseas. St Kilda, Footscray and Flemington were the most frequent locations of reported police mistreatment and the largest proportion occurred during afternoon shift. 2.0 POLICE BEHAVIOUR This section of the report describes the characteristics of the police involved in the reported mistreatment the nature of the reported mistreatment and the type of place in which the mistreatment occurred. Detailed tables are presented in Appendix 3. 2.1. Number of Police Involved In 40% of incidents there were at least 2 police involved. In a further 15% of incidents there were 4 police involved. In 21.4% of cases there were 5 or more police officers involved (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.1.) (See also Case Study 21). 2.2 Characteristics of Police Involved 2.2.1 Gender In 40% of all reported cases there was at least one policewoman involved. However in incidents involving female respondents, female officers were present in only 23.0% (N=26) of all cases. (See also Case study 17). 2.2.2 Uniform In 75% of incidents police were in a uniform, in 14% they were not in uniform and in 7.0% no answer was recorded. 2.2.3 Rank Of the 92 victims able to identify the ranks of police involved, 58% were identified as constables, 11% were senior constables, 20% were sergeants and 10% involved a detective (unspecified rank) (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.2). 2.2.4 Special police squad Special police squads were identified as being involved in mistreatment in 37 incidents: 15 reported incidents involved the CIB; 12 involved the Transit Patrol; 4 involved the Drug Squad ; 3 involved the Asia Squad; 3 involved the Armed Robbery Squad; and 3 involved the Major Crime Squad. Other incidents involved the Community Policing Squad, Homicide, the Traffic Operations Group and the involvement of officers from Community Services Victoria. 2.2.5 Identification In 47% incidents the police identified themselves to their victims. 2.3 Location of Incident 34% of all reported incidents occurred within the confines of a police station, 23% occurred in the persons' home, 23% occurred in the street and 7% occurred in public toilets (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3). 2.3.1 Location of Police Station The largest proportion of reported police station incidents occurred at St Kilda police station. Other stations with large numbers of incidents include Footscray and Flemington (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3.1). 2.3.2 Gender and Place of Incident There was a statistically significant relationship between gender and place of incident. Women were 50% more likely than men to report mistreatment in their homes. Men were more likely to report mistreatment in public toilets and railway stations. There was no difference between the proportions of male and female victims mistreated in police stations and on the street (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3.2). 2.3.3 Age and Place of Incident There was a significant relationship between age and place of incident. Respondents aged over 25 years were more likely than other respondents to report mistreatment at home. Respondents aged under 16 years were more likely to report mistreatment in public toilets. There was no significant relationship between age and mistreatment in police stations (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3.3). 2.3.4 Language Preference and Place of Incident There was no statistically significant relationship between preferred language of respondents and place of incident (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3.4). 2.4 Nature of Mistreatment Respondents were given a choice of 14 categories of types of mistreatment to ensure consistency in their responses. Up to three responses were coded as it was felt that the use of three categories would provide sufficient data to provide an understanding of the types of mistreatment being experienced. This means that percentages add up to more than 100%. Table 1. summarises the number of incidents for the 10 most common categories of mistreatment. Verbal and physical abuse were the most frequently reported forms of police mistreatment but threats, racial abuse and denial of legislative rights to third party witnesses were also common. (See also Case Studies 11, 14, 15, 16 and 18). Table 1.

The most frequently reported injuries were bruises and broken bones. (See also Case Study 1, 7, 13). Table 2. Type of Injury Type of Injury      Number and %      Bruising              51 (71.8%)     Broken Bones           9 (12.7%)      Cuts and Abrasions     3 (4.2%)      Coughing Blood         2 (2.8%)Severe Pain            2 (2.8%)      Back Injury            1 (1.4%)      Severe Shock           1 (1.4%)      Foetal Complications   1 (1.4%) 2.4.2 Type of Injury and Place of Incident Bruising and broken bones from mistreatment in police stations comprised the greatest number of injuries reported by respondents. This was followed by similar injuries received in homes and on the street (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.4.2). (See also Case Study 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12). 2.5 Respondents Informed of Their Right to Complain about Police Treatment Only 20% of respondents say they were told that they had the right to complain about their treatment by police (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5). 2.5.1 Gender and Whether Respondent Informed of Right to Complain about Police Treatment There was no significant difference between male and female respondents in the frequency with which they say they were informed of their right to complain about police treatment (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5.1). 2.5.2 Age and Whether Respondent Informed of Right to Complain about Police Treatment There was a significant relationship between age and whether the respondent said he or she had been informed of his or her right to complain about police treatment (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5.2). Those aged under 16 years, 17-20 years or 21-24 years were more likely to have been informed of their rights. The highest proportion informed of their rights (21-24 y.o) was 34.5%. The highest not informed was for (25-28 y.o) at 90%. 2.5.3 Language Preference and Whether Respondent Informed of Right to Complain about Police Treatment There was no significant relationship between language preference of respondents and their saying they were informed of their right to complain about police behaviour. Although only 13% of non-English language preference respondents and 21% of English speakers were informed of their right to complain about police mistreatment (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5.3). 2.5.4 Police Station and Whether Informed of Rights In 25 police stations the respondents say they were not informed of their rights to complain. These numbers were highest in St Kilda, City West and Flemington (see Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5.4). 2.5.5 Previous Formal Complaint Over 56% of respondents reported previous police mistreatment and, of these, 22% had made a formal complaint. Therefore, overall, only 11% of the respondents who alleged police mistreatment in this survey already knew about the complaint system from previous experience of complaining. 2.6 Interpreter for Non-English Speaking Respondents An interpreter was present for only eight 30%(N=8) of 23 respondents who preferred to use a language other than English. An independent interpreter was used in four of these cases and one case used the telephone interpreting service. (See also Case Study 4) Five respondents indicated that police did not offer an interpreter. A further 11 indicated that an interpreter was not present for other reasons such as their being unaware of their rights or that they lacked the English speaking skills to ask for an interpreter. (See Appendix 3 Table 3.3.2.1) Although 70% of individuals indicating that they preferred a language other than English and may have been wrongly denied the help of an interpreter caution should be used in interpreting these figures as the actual numbers are low. 2.7 SUMMARY In summary, police mistreatment reported by respondents usually involved more than one constable or senior constable. Female police officers were involved in more incidents involving men than women respondents. Nearly half of the police officers identified themselves. One third of incidents occurred in police stations. This proportion was independent of gender, age and language preference. Women and respondents aged over 25 years were more likely to report mistreatment in their homes. Verbal and physical abuse, particularly bruising and broken bones, were the most frequently reported forms of mistreatment stated in the survey. Bruising was most frequently inflicted in police stations, at home or on the street. Incidents involving broken bones usually occurred in police stations and private houses. Most respondents say they were not informed of their right to complain about police behaviour. These numbers were highest in St Kilda, City West and Flemington police stations. This was not generally related to gender, age or language preference. 3.0 DETAILS ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THE INCIDENT The outcomes of incidents reported by respondents include the legal consequences of the event, the time they were detained in police custody and their formal and informal reporting of the alleged police misbehaviour. 3.1 Legal Consequences of the Incident About 61% of respondents said they were charged with offences as the result of their interaction with police. Of these cases 27% were charged with assault, 22% with theft, 13% with drunk and disorderly and 10% with drug offences. Other charges included transit offences, wilful trespass, unlawful possession, exceeding 0.05%, breaking and enter, indecent language and offensive behaviour. About 30% of all respondents said they were arrested. A further 22% were charged on summons, 5% were cautioned and 2% involved protection order applications. Other cases involved holding in cells, fingerprinting or photographing but no other reported legal action (see Appendix 3 Table 3.3.1). In another 23% of cases, respondents said that no legal action against them was taken by police. About 67% of respondents reported that a statement had been taken by police and 28% indicated that no statement was taken. 3.2 Length of Time in Custody At least 53% of respondents indicated that they were taken into police custody. About 70% of respondents who were taken into custody were Australian born. The next largest groups were born in Vietnam (10%), United Kingdom (5%) and New Zealand (3%). Other countries of origin included Malaysia, Italy, U.S.A., Bulgaria, Poland, Ethiopia, Holland, Turkey, Greece, Argentina, Cambodia, Sweden, Thailand, Laos and El Salvador. Over 61% of these respondents spent four hours or less in custody, 28% spent between 5 and 8 hours, and 11% spent more than 9 hours in custody (see Appendix 3 Table 3.3.2). 3.2.1 Gender and Length of Time in Custody Women were more likely than men to spend less than four hours in custody (see Appendix 3 Table 3.3.2.1). However, although the majority of survey respondents were male, females had been taken into custody in roughly similar proportions. 3.2.2 Age and Length of Time in Custody The proportion of respondents detained in custody for more than nine hours increased with age (see Appendix 3 Table 3.3.2.2) with no one in the under 16 year category being detained that long. 3.3 Report of Incident About 60% of respondents indicated that they had not reported the current incident, 38% indicated that they had made a formal complaint and 2% did not respond to this question. 3.3.1 Formal Report of Current Incident Respondents who had formally complained usually did so to lawyers or the Victoria Police Internal Investigations Department. Table 3.

In this survey 70% of respondents indicated that they had discussed their mistreatment with other professionals. Over half of those who reported their mistreatment informally, did so to a community worker. Others discussed it with parents and friends. A further 5 cases relating to the transit patrol were reported to the Ministry of Transport. The remainder had discussed it with a range of individuals including their solicitor and Legal Aid. (see Appendix 3 Table 3.3.3.2) 3.3.3 Reason for Not Reporting Current Incident The most common reasons given for non-reporting are as follows: *39% were frightened *29% said that it would not have achieved anything *12% were scared of reprisals * 3% said threats were made to them , and *14% didn't know how. There was a significant relationship between preference for English language and the reason for not reporting. Over 50% of non-English speakers said they were frightened. In contrast, only 37% of English speakers said they did not make a formal report because they were frightened and a further 31% said it would not achieve anything (see Appendix 3 Table 3.3.3.3). There was no significant relationship between the reasons given by respondents for not reporting the incident and their gender or age. 3.4 SUMMARY Only 60% of respondents were charged with offences arising out of their interaction with the police and over 50% were detained in custody. Of these respondents, 60% were detained for less than 4 hours. The period of detention was greater for men than for women respondents and increased with age. Although the majority of survey respondents were male, females had been taken into custody in roughly similar proportions. Nearly 40% of respondents formally complained about their mistreatment by police to their lawyer or the Internal Investigations Department of Victoria Police. The high frequency with which complaints were made to lawyers may reflect the project's auspicing by the Federation of Community Legal Centres. About 70% discussed the incident in a less formal professional environment, usually with community workers. Most respondents who had not complained said they were too frightened or cynical of the consequences of their complaint. Only 14% said they did not know how to complain. There was no relationship between gender or age and respondents' reasons for not making a formal complaint. However, respondents who preferred to speak a language other than English were more likely than English speakers to say they were too frightened to make a complaint. On the other hand, English speakers were more likely to say that a complaint would not achieve anything.

THE COMPLAINTS BIBLIOGRAPHY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The survey involved 189 cases of alleged police mistreatment which came to the attention of community workers in various settings over a four month period in late 1991 to early 1992. The data represent one of the few examples of documentation of police complaints independent of the criminal justice system. We hope that the report and the cases presented inform the reader of some of the characteristics of police mistreatment and that they point the way forward for enhancing police complaints mechanisms and most importantly police accountability to the community they serve. PURPOSE: The need for this police complaints survey arises from concern within the Federation of Community Legal Centres about the nature and extent of inappropriate police practices. The report presents information on the way clients of many community agencies in Victoria experience police mistreatment. It examines details about incidents and how citizens respond in these situations as well as examining police practices and where mistreatment occurs. As there is very little independent information available about the everyday practices of Victoria Police, by taking an annual snapshot it is possible to explore the nature of police mistreatment in Victoria and highlight issues for law reform. OBJECTIVES: The specific objectives of this survey were: To give a voice to the concerns of citizens attending legal centres and other community agencies who have been mistreated by the police; To gather information which helps the Federation of Community Legal Centres to develop a profile of incidents of mistreatment by police; To identify trends that are occurring over the year(s) such as: the nature and extent of police mistreatment; who is mistreated; in what ways; by whom; what action is or isn't taken and what the reasons might be for such action OR inaction; To ascertain what, if any, gender, race, age or other discrimination practices are occurring; To provide a practical focus for the development of recommendations. INTRODUCTION: This report is based on the analysis of the results of a survey distributed by participating Victorian Community Legal Centres to individuals through a network of metropolitan and country community agencies in 1991/92. It is the second report on police mistreatment undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic) Inc. and is one of many reports which have been presented in Victoria in the last decade. Much of the research conducted by legal centres and other groups documents the prevalent nature of police mistreatment. The first survey (1990-91) initiated by the Federation of Community Legal Centres into police mistreatment of young people by police indicated that: more than 84% of those surveyed were male, 78% were from an English speaking background, 51% were unemployed and 7% were from a professional/non-working class background. Verbal abuse comprised 33% and physical abuse 29% of the incidents. 31% of cases recorded that a police record of interview was completed 34% of cases no formal police action was taken. 23% were charged by summons, 18% were charged and bailed, 20% were kept in cells. Some 64% of respondents indicated that they had not formally reported the incident. 46% of these were either too frightened, feared reprisals, or were threatened, 27% didn't know how to make a complaint, and 22% believed that it would not have made any difference. Of those who had reported the incident only 20% had reported to an authority officially empowered to investigate complaints of police mistreatment. Similar results were found in a Victorian Council for Civil Liberties telephone survey in 1992. Existing research also indicates that those most frequently affected are vulnerable people who have little chance of defending themselves. The National Inquiry into Racist Violence heard evidence that many of the attacks upon Aborigines, young and old, were perpetrated by police. Research undertaken in Victoria on homeless young people reports that fortyseven per cent of females and fifty per cent of males reported being physically hurt by police. A report on young people and the police found that police were more likely to be heavyhanded in their dealings with young men, Aboriginal youth and marginal youth. These groups were more likely than other youth to be stopped and spoken to by the police, taken to a police station, and to report being roughed up. A report by G.L.A.D., Gay men and Lesbians Against Discrimination, describes as "the most disturbing aspect" of the survey they undertook, the extent to which gay men and lesbians reported harassment, discrimination and violence at the hands of the police. The 1991 survey undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centres into police mistreatment included a number of examples of police assault on young people and sexual abuse of women. The latest figures indicate that the number of formal complaints against the Victoria Police has risen from 1056 in 1988/89 to 4525 in 1991/92. This is an increase of 410%. in four years. There is now one complaint per year for every two sworn police officers in Victoria. Victoria Police have consistently denied the legitimacy of Victorian studies which demonstrate police misbehaviour. Further to this, while police themselves have recognised that traditional policing has failed Government funding of law and order policies has increased from $M495 in 1988-89 to $M634 in 1991-92 an increase of 30% in 4 years. Concomitantly police operating budgets have become sacrosanct, the Premier, Mr Kennett, has indicated that police resources and police numbers would not be cut, despite the massive cutbacks being made to all other state funded services. The ineffectiveness of pro-active policing by traditional police forces has been fully recognised. In the 1987-88 Annual Report the Chief Commissioner openly admitted that by themselves the police were unable to reduce crime. In this regard the police have responded to growing concern about police practices, the effectiveness of policing, and police efficiency, by imposing responsibility for crime prevention on the community. While we recognise the possible benefits that can arise out of various community policing initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Police Community Consultative Committees, Police in Schools and via crime prevention, the point remains that law and order responses don't work, that the police say that they don't work and therefore rather than pursue more police, more police resources, more police powers, and harsher sentencing, we must invest far more in community development. Similarly, the heavy promotion of community policing as an accountability mechanism fails to recognise the serious limits placed on community policing structures. These structures have no control over policing policy and practices and may in fact confuse accountability with public relations rather than a fundamental enhancement of police accountability. What is needed is a more rigorous analysis of police mistreatment and how police can be made accountable in their everyday practices. This report endeavours to raise for debate important issues regarding police practices in Victoria. As the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) recently suggested, the: "goal of any democratic community should be to have a trustworthy, professional and impartial police force....[t]he present system can be improved by [amongst other things]...most importantly, greater consideration given to the complainant's perception of the [complaints] system."(Perry,B. 1992) We agree totally, this report presents the complainant's views of their experiences of police mistreatment. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The principal findings of the study have been presented under the following categories: 1.0 Characteristics of respondents and incidents; 2.0 Police behaviour; and 3.0 Details about the outcome of the incident. The findings of each section are summarised as follows: 1.0 Characteristics of Respondents and Incidents: The typical victim of police mistreatment who responded in the 1992 survey is male, and under the age of 30. He is likely to reside in the greater metropolitan area of Melbourne and not to be in the paid workforce. Over one half of respondents have been previously mistreated by the police and one third stated that they were born overseas. While language is not a problem for many respondents it affected almost half of those who indicated that they were born overseas. St Kilda, Footscray and Flemington were the most frequent locations of reported police mistreatment and the largest proportion occurred during afternoon shift. 2.0 Police behaviour: Police mistreatment reported by respondents usually involved more than one constable or senior constable. Female police officers were involved in more incidents involving male than female respondents. Nearly half of the police officers identified themselves. One third of incidents occurred in police stations. This proportion was independent of gender, age and language preference. Women and respondents aged over 25 years were more likely to report mistreatment in their homes. Verbal and physical abuse, particularly bruising and broken bones, were the most frequently reported forms of mistreatment reported in the survey. Bruising was most frequently inflicted in police stations, at home or on the street. Incidents involving broken bones usually occurred in police stations and private houses. Most respondents say they were not informed of their right to complain about police behaviour. These numbers were highest in St Kilda, City West and Flemington police stations. This was not generally related to gender, age or language preference. 3.0 Details about the Outcome of the Incident: 60% of respondents were charged with offences arising out of their interaction with the police and over 50% were detained in custody. Of these respondents, 60% were detained for less than 4 hours. The period of detention was greater for men than for women respondents and increased with age. Although the majority of survey respondents were male, females had been taken into custody in roughly similar proportions. Nearly 40% of respondents formally complained about their mistreatment by police. Of this 40% (N=78) some 32 (or 41%) complained to a lawyer and 22 (28%) complained to IID. The high frequency with which complaints were made to lawyers may reflect the project's auspicing by the Federation of Community Legal Centres or the lack of faith in reporting to formal established complaints mechanisms. About 70% discussed the incident in a less formal professional environment, usually with community workers. Most respondents who had not complained said they were too frightened or cynical of the consequences of their complaint. Only 14% said they did not know how to complain. There was no relationship between gender or age and respondents' reasons for not making a formal complaint. However, respondents who preferred to speak a language other than English were more likely than English speakers to say they were too frightened to make a complaint. On the other hand, English speakers were more likely to say that a complaint would not achieve anything. DISCUSSION: The information collected in this 1992 Federation of Community Legal Services survey accords with previous research. In particular, the survey data support assertions that those who become victims of police mistreatment are minority and powerless members of the community. Between 70% and 80% of victims are men At least 60% of victims are aged under 30 years Most victims are not in the workforce. About 39% are unemployed and another 30% are students or pensioners People with non English speaking backgrounds are over represented among victims who fear to complain Independent interpreters were not provided for 70% of victims who have difficulty with the English language Half of the victims have been previously mistreated by police Only 20% of victims use formal report mechanisms such as the Internal Investigations Department of Victoria Police and the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) Fear of repercussions and cynicism about the usefulness of existing formal complaint systems are the most usual reason given for not formally reporting the incident Up to 30% of victims were abused and detained without subsequent charges being laid. This survey exposes these general characteristics of victims of police abuse. The data indicate that most incidents involve several uniformed police officers of constable rank and that the incidents usually occur in police stations or private homes. Mistreatment which occurs in police stations is more likely to result in physical injury, particularly bruising and broken bones. The frequency is not influenced by the victims, gender, age or language preference. In contrast, injuries inflicted at home are more likely to involve women and respondents aged over 25 years. The survey indicates that victims fear of reporting incidents through formal channels is greater in non-English speakers. There is evidence that cynicism about the formal complaints system is justified. Those who become victims of police attacks have little success in bringing those police officers involved to justice. Usually it is the word of at least one police officer against the complainant. Police culture which places a greater emphasis on "sticking together" is a significant factor to be reckoned with, and is a significant inhibitor to those deciding to make a complaint of police mistreatment. It could be suggested that police complaints authorities need greater input into police recruitment and training policy and investigative and punitive powers to ensure deterrent effect. There is a need for the Deputy Ombudsman's Annual Reports to explain the results of his work rather than merely report them as in his most recent Annual Report, where he took to task critics of the process for handling police complaints while offering no hints about any limitations to the current system. Clearly, there is a divergence in the ways of understanding police complaints. Community Legal Centres believe that Victorian Police have progressively become more isolated and alienated from local communities. The very nature of a very large, highly mobile and transient force is undoubtably an important factor leading to this two way split. Attempts at community police liaison and developments such as police community consultative committees (P.C.C.C.) have generally not been successful. These local committees have never possessed any real decision making powers, and on occasions have been subject to directions higher in the police force quashing local community initiatives aimed at developing local accountability. There can be no substitute for the development of real dialogue and accountability of police to their local communities. Clearly appropriate guidelines need to be established for the operation of community management structures for police. As of the present time no government in Victoria has yet addressed the widening gap between police and local communities. The future safety of our community requires a move away from police officers barricaded from the community by roller doors, high security fences, and motor vehicle windows two thirds closed. These images tell the community that the police do no trust the community and therefore are not to be trusted themselves. The development of local community management structures must not be left in the hands of the police force, but rather with the appropriate input from bodies such as the Law Reform Committees, Ethnic Communities, Womens Groups, Youth Organisations and local government to name a few of the obvious participants. More police, with more powers and more community alienating equipment is not the solution. More can be done with less in the area of Policing, what is really needed is a different style for achieving outcomes. What is required in Victoria is a radical rethink of the direction in which our police force is going and the way in which our police are held accountable to local communities. Under the current system, most complaints about police are investigated by police from the same district. Whilst the task of this report was not to collect data on police investigation of complaints, it is worth noting that the experience of Community Legal Centres indicates that often police investigate those for whom they have a direct line of responsibility. Such a system may be a convenient means of investigating complaints but it undermines any confidence or faith an individual may have, particularly if they have been strip searched, beaten, confined and subsequently threatened with reprisals if they complained about their treatment. It is imperative that a broad based, impartial, independent and well resourced police complaints mechanism be established. This survey indicates that community workers are more likely than the formal complaint system to receive complaints. Community Legal Centre workers have assisted clients who have been mistreated, falsely charged or harassed in making a complaint against police. However it is not unusual for the lawyer to advise the client against complaining given the implications for pre-trial negotiations for the current matter and the possibility of future harassment. The police and the Government seem unable to understand that the real issue underlying the low formal complaint rate of victims is distrust and fear of those to whom they must complain rather than unwillingness to complain per se. Therefore it is crucial that development of any new police complaints system include full community consultation. Beyond this, there are also ways in which the Government can enhance accountability simply and efficiently such as through the development of an independent community visitors scheme with powers to randomly visit police stations, to protect the rights of individuals in custody is urgent. The establishment of independent community visitors schemes covering all police stations in Victoria is in the interests of the police, members of the public taken into police custody, and the Victorian community in general. An adaptation of the community visitors scheme which has operated in some psychiatric institutions could occur. An added benefit of such an approach if properly implemented is that of making the police directly accountable to the community that they are serving. Such measures have already been implemented in some parts of England. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation:1 That the Government implement a review of Police accountability in Victoria. Recommendation:2 That Representatives from the Federation of Community Legal Centres and other community agencies meet with the Chief Commissioner of Police at formal regular briefing sessions to exchange information on various aspects of policing in Victoria. Recommendation:3 It is imperative that a broad based, impartial, independent and well resourced Police Complaints mechanism be established. Recommendation:4 That a police powers monitoring authority be established to independently monitor and review the use and abuse of existing police powers. Recommendation:5 That in examining the type of structure to be established, due and proper consultation occur with the community. Recommendation:6 Such a structure should have powers to refer criminal charges to the Department of Public Prosecutions and to impose other disciplinary sanctions against police officers. Recommendation:7 Such a structure should have a clear Government mandate to make recommendations on police procedure and practices, recruitment and training policies. Recommendation:8 That a formal mechanism be put in place for the reporting by the judiciary of instances of police malpractice which have been identified in courts. Recommendation:9 That a community visitors scheme with powers to randomly visit police stations be implemented throughout Victoria. Recommendation:10 That community visitors have the right to unimpeded freedom of movement throughout the police station and the legislative capacity to formally report activities, circumstances and recommendations to the responsible authorities for further investigation and action. Recommendation:11 That it be a criminal offence for police to obstruct a community visitor in the course of their duties. Recommendation:12 That the role and function of PCCC's be independently evaluated and monitored. Recommendation:13 That formal mechanisms be introduced to allow victims of police mistreatment to be kept fully informed of the progress of their complaint to the authorities. Recommendation:14 That the Deputy Ombudsman immediately investigate ways of addressing the low substantiation rates of current police complaints, particularly allegations of assault and harassment. Recommendation:15 That the process for dealing with proven cases of mistreatment be open to public scrutiny and input as these are community matters. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation :16 Unless life is at risk body searches and strip searches should be banned. Under most circumstances prior to police initiating a strip search or body search Police should be required to seek the consent of a Magistrate and if the body search is to occur that it only occur with the assistance of a Medical Practitioner. Recommendation:17 It should be a criminal offence for strip searches to be conducted by members of the opposite sex. Recommendation:18 That a register and an independent monitoring mechanism be established to oversight the use of strip searches and their proper and improper use by police. Recommendation:19 That the State Government withdraw its proposed legislation to increase police powers with respect to taking fingerprints, body-samples and demanding names and addresses from suspects. Recommendation:20 Section 464C of the Crimes Act should be amended to make it a criminal offence for a police officer to deny a suspect the right to communicate with a friend, relative or legal practitioner. Recommendation:21 Section 464D of the Crimes Act should be amended to make it a criminal offence for a police officer to fail to get an "independent third person" when required. Recommendation:22 That the Government in consultation with Police and the Community undertake a major review of Police Gun policy. Recommendation:23 Victoria Police adopt a "least restrictive force" policy and that part of this policy focus on measures to eliminate the use of firearms. Recommendation:24 Police Officers who are still in their probationary period of training be banned from carrying guns for the period of their probation. Recommendation:25 That the right to refuse to carry weapons by police officers be more actively promoted and the right to carry arms should be limited to certain areas of police activity Recommendation:26 That Specialist Police Squads be disbanded. Failing this preferred option to disband, regular independent judicial reviews of the activities of these remaining squads should occur. These reviews should call for public comment and findings be made public. Recommendation:27 That an open inquiry be held into the training needs of the Victoria Police Force. Such an inquiry should consider the benefits of establishing a more substantial and thorough recruit training course. It should also consider the benefits of promoting tertiary education of force members. Incentives for such training should be made available and applicants should be supported financially and be duly recognised by the Force. Recommendation:28 Legal Aid Impact statements should be introduced as a matter of course whenever an increase in police powers or resources is occurring or new legislation is being considered. Such statements would detail the financial impact on the Criminal Justice System. Financial allowance compensating for the downstream impact of such powers or legislative change needs to be addressed. Recommendation:29 That a review be held into the operation of on the spot fines and that consideration be given to establishing a mechanism where complaints or objections are able to be heard in an informal and cost free environment. The review should also consider the introduction of a variable or progressive scale of fines which takes into account each persons ability to pay. Recommendation:30 That the State Government initiate law reform measures aimed at legalisation or decriminalisation of minor drug use based on similar initiatives implemented in other Australian States. Recommendation:31 That if victim impact statements are to be used in Victoria they should also be used in Police mistreatment cases. Recommendation :32 In line with Recommendation 79 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody(RCIAD) and the Victorian Law Reform Commission Reports No. 25 and 32 the offence of public drunkenness should be abolished. Further in line with Recommendation 86 of the (RCIAD), people should not be arrested and charged for just using offensive language. Recommendation:33 In line with Recommendation 80 of the RCIADC it is recommended that adequately funded programs to establish and maintain non-custodial facilities for the care and treatment of intoxicated persons should be established and that legislation should place a statutory duty upon police to consider and utilise these alternatives. Police should not be the sole arbiters in deciding on these alternatives. Recommendation:34 That the Crime Statistics Unit currently housed within the Department of Justice (the same Department covering the Police) be disbanded Recommendation:35 The "independent" Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research be re-established in Victoria. That its workings be overseen by an independent board. That every attempt be made to de-politicise the selective gathering and presentation of statistics.

FEDERATION OF COMMUNITY LEGAL CENTRES REPORT INTO MISTREATMENT BY POLICE 1991-92 Written by: S.Biondo (Community Development Officer-Fitzroy Legal Service) and D.Palmer (Lecturer, Legal Studies Department-LaTrobe University), with the assistance of the Federation of Community Legal Centres Police Issues Working Group. Prepared for the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic.) Police Issues Group, May 1993 Table of Contents Executive Summary Recommendations Other Recommendations Overview Introduction Purpose: Objectives Methodology OVERVIEW: This survey and research report arose as an endeavour to help articulate the concerns of many in our community about the less acceptable aspects of modern policing. It attempts to raise some very difficult issues which confront our community. The challenge is not to take these as a personal affront but to constructively work towards the means by which dialogue and consultation will enhance justice and democracy. Policing is political, not so much in the sense of being connected to formal politics and political parties, nor as being instruments of a particular political group. Rather, it is in the way that policing involves choices, choices that range from those made at the broader policy level, through to choices made by an individual police officer "on the beat" meeting a member of the public. Such choices do not occur in a vacuum, but are shaped by a myriad of factors, such as police officers backgrounds, police training, police occupational culture, the legal framework the police operate under and so on (Finnane 1990:219-20). There is little doubt that the police themselves would readily recognise their role in the broader political process. We have become very much accustomed to the statements (often outbursts) from the Police Association. It is worth noting that the recent Inquiry into policing in Queensland (the Fitzgerald Inquiry) commented that the Queensland Police Association is for all intensive purposes a union, and that the union had an important role in supporting and promoting the police occupational culture and code of conduct. The union was an influential source of "opposition to any significant reform" (see Fitzgerald Ch.VII). The behaviour and actions of the Victorian Police Association in recent years suggests that Fitzgerald's comments might, unfortunately, apply with equal force in Victoria. We have also had to listen to and read the comments of previous senior police now in retirement. Lest we see this as merely "blasts from the past", that we also have a constant commentary on all types of issues, such as crime, road safety, (im)morality, and sentencing, from contemporary police administrations. In making their political comments police are often attempting to focus what it is that we are to discuss and how it will be discussed. For instance, the police are quite happy to accept that there are some "rotten apples", (police personnel who bring disrepute to the Police Force), and that such "rotten apples" should be exorcised before the rot spreads. Even they realise that to deny some level of misbehaviour would be futile. The courts have found cases against the police before and since the very introduction of the "modern police" in the nineteenth century. The courts continue to convict police of all types of corruption, misbehaviour and violence. Royal Commissions have also heavily criticised police practices (albeit that Royal Commissions rarely produce convictions). The recent "Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody" (RCIADC) had much to say about policing. By promoting the idea that there are a few "rotten apples" that the police themselves have identified and cut from their ranks, the police are also concerned to show that they are best able to deal with the few recalcitrant police officers that have somehow managed to exist. Linked to this ethos of "self management", the police regard "outside" criticism as being from vested interests that do not represent the real views of the community, and that these people are trying to place such unreasonable demands on the police (so they say) that they will no longer be able to effectively perform their duties. While it might be true that the crude number of police involved in "misbehaviour" is only a percentage of the total number, the way in which this misbehaviour is explained is vital to developing a means of effectively dealing with police mistreatment of people. The report that follows is an attempt to understand the features of police mistreatment in Victoria in the 1990's. Before examining our analysis of specific cases of mistreatment it must be recognised that there is now a widespread body of literature documenting and examining the extent of police mistreatment. Dr. Mark Finnane argued that, while policing is always political in its broader sense, in recent years the introduction of many agencies and interest groups concerned with police and police practices has changed the level and character of political involvement and power. For instance the introduction of the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints), the now defunct Police Complaints Authority in Victoria, the various Law Reform Commission reports, all examined police behaviour. Secondly, various social and political movements have made the police and policing practices the focus of their attention, arguing for various changes in policing (changes which can involve either more policing, such as violence in the home and corporate crime, or less policing, such as policing the streets, aborigines, young people ). However, we must not make the mistake of assuming that the police are not, part of the broader political processes as police and policing is fundamentally about politics. One of the key considerations in the politics of policing has been the continual demands made by the police for continued growth of their share of state resources. However, the latest budget statement from the Victorian State Government, which aimed at attempting to persuade the community about the absolute necessity for all sections of the community and government services to "pay" for the serious financial difficulties that Victoria is currently facing, overlooked such a "contribution" from the police. Even in the most dire of economic circumstances, the police continue to maintain their level of government funding and experience a proportional real increase in this share. However, despite the dramatic and continued growth in police funding, the latest Annual Report (1991-92) contains a Foreword from the now retired Chief Commissioner of Police, Kel Glare, stating that his job has been difficult in part because of the "substantial funding constraints". Police have done well under both Liberal and Labor parties. Increased police funding is not deterred by party politics. The police revelled in massive growth in funding under the Labor Government in the period 1981-1992, in terms of the raised capital expenditure on police stations, and significant improvement in their superannuation which has led to the departure of many experienced police officers. Resources should also be thought of in terms that encompass such matters as police powers. The Labor years witnessed an almost total achievement by the police of the powers they demanded, such as the abolition on time constraints for holding people in custody without formally charging them and powers to use force to take intimate body samples. Exceptions on which the Labor Government refused to submit to police political persuasion included the power to ask for a persons name an address without having reasonable suspicion that they had committed an offence (however this power is currently being sought), and some minor limits on the power to use force to obtain fingerprints and intimate body sample (a power which can be granted to the police by a magistrate if certain conditions are met). Put simply, the 1980's were good years for the police. They have benefited financially, they have been granted significant increases in their legal powers, and they through discrediting of the Police Complaints Authority(PCA) managed to rid themselves of this independent accountability mechanism. However, the community has begun to express further concerns about the continued growth in police funding. There is also concern about the level of police mistreatment of the public. It is true that such views are expressed by minority groups, organisations and individuals. It is also true that few publically endorse or embrace the massive police budget, and thus the continued effort by the police themselves to promote the idea that they are the "thin blue line", working under difficult conditions to protect the community from passing over the precipice of order into chaos. There is evidence now emerging from the criminal justice system itself that there are some reasons to be concerned about police mistreatment and police accountability. In particular, the latest figures on formal complaints made against the police, as outlined in Figure 1 indicates that, since 1988-89 the number of formal complaints against the Victoria Police has risen from 1056 to 4525 an increase of 410%. It is rather stunning therefore that in the latest Police Annual Report, one of the key mechanisms through which the police are accountable to the Parliament and to the People, the head of the Police Internal Investigations Department does not even bother to provide the actual number of complaints (though a Bar-Chart indicates the prevalence of complaints of police assault). Nothing is done to explain in the report the reasons behind the rise in complaints. The Police seem to accept that these figures merely confirm the level of public support for the current complaints procedures. If this is so then proponents of this view are left to explain firstly why there has been such a substantial increase in the number of complaints, and, secondly, why on a per capita basis there is almost one complaint for every two police officers! While the above view may be taken by police management, the findings of recent surveys on police mistreatment throw more light on the subject. Two recent public phone-in surveys have found remarkably similar results in Victoria and Western Australia. A Victorian Council for Civil Liberties survey found that of those who gave a reason for not formally complaining (N=53) about police mistreatment, 51% indicated that they feared possible repercussions from formally complaining. A further 26% believed that "nothing was likely to happen" (Palmer 1992a). A similar survey conducted in Western Australia found 60% of respondents had not made a formal complaint. Approximately 50% (N=115) didn't complain because they believed it would be of no use and 28% (N=64) of these because of fear of possible repercussions (Hall 1992:10). While policing issues are clearly not able to be compared directly between the states, the importance of these two surveys is the general finding that a significant number of people who allege police mistreatment do not have faith in the complaints mechanisms as they operate in each state. For those who are subject to the policing experience, and for some others, there is a growing concern about policing practices, concern about the effectiveness of policing, and concern about police efficiency. By their own measure, despite the dramatic increase in powers and in financial resources, the police have openly admitted that they have been unable to reduce crime. The police have responded to these concerns by shifts in the emphasis for the responsibility for crime. In this respect there has been an increased emphasis on the responsibility of the community in reducing crime. In effect the police suggest that they are no longer responsible by themselves for the war against crime. It is now a partnership. Examples of such a discourse has manifested itself in the promotion of the many "Watches" and similar campaigns. They have implemented Police Community Consultative Committees, police on foot patrol, on bike patrol, and police in primary schools "educating" the youth of tomorrow how the community must take measures to protect themselves against crime. These are just some of the broader issues against which this report is being produced. The police are a very powerful organisation, entrusted with significant powers over individuals - the power to detain, to arrest, to search, to charge and to prosecute. The police decide whether to bring a person into the criminal justice system or whether to keep them out of the system. Thus, any complaints about policing practices must be taken seriously. Beyond this, we believe that there must be greater powers and efforts to examine the nature of bad policing. This report focuses on the bad practices associated with contemporary policing in Victoria it also considers police mistreatment by focusing largely on police action rather than police inaction. Some might view this as "splitting hairs" but it is important to recognise that police mistreatment can sometimes involve the police denying some citizens protection and undervaluing their claims on police resources. INTRODUCTION PURPOSE: The need for this police complaints survey arises from concern within the Federation of Community Legal Centres about the nature and extent of inappropriate police practices. The purpose of this survey is to collect information and take a "snapshot" of the way clients of community agencies in Victoria experience police mistreatment. The report examines details about incidents and how citizens respond in these situations. In addition, information is gathered about police practices and where mistreatment occurs. There is very little independent information available about the everyday practices of Victoria Police. By taking an annual snapshot it is possible to explore the nature of police mistreatment in Victoria and highlight issues for law reform. OBJECTIVES: The specific objectives of this survey were: To give a voice to the concerns of citizens attending legal centres and other community agencies who have been mistreated by the police; To gather information which helps the Federation of Community Legal Centres to develop a profile of incidents of mistreatment by police; To identify trends that are occurring over the year(s) such as: the nature and extent of police mistreatment; who is mistreated; in what ways; by whom; what action is or isn't taken and what the reasons might be for such action OR inaction; To ascertain what, if any, gender, race, age or other discrimination practices are occurring; To provide a practical focus for the development of recommendations. This report is based on the analysis of the results of a survey distributed by participating Victorian Community Legal Centres to individuals through a network of metropolitan and country community agencies in 1991-92. It is the second report on police mistreatment undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic) Inc. and is one of many works in the area which have been presented in Victoria in the last decade. Some of these works include: Police Mistreatment in Northcote... Fitzroy Legal Service, I980; Shooting the Messenger: The Trial and Execution of the Victoria Police Complaints Authority...

Some of the relevant international research includes: The Scarman report:Report of an Inquiry on the Brixton Disorders (Lord Scarman)1981 and the Royal Commission into Criminal Procedure (United Kingdom) A Situational Analysis of Police Assaults(criminal justice) (Wilson,L.A 1990 thesis); Regulating Custodial Interviews: The effect of Legislation an Formal Rules on the Practice and Process of Police Interrogation (Mckenzie,I 1989 thesis); An Examination of the effect of a Police Officers age at the time of Employment on Involvement in Misconduct Shortreed,S.C (1989 thesis); An Analysis of Police Contacts with the Police Cheng,Ming Chwang (1988 Phd thesis); Strategic changes in police interrogation: An Examination of Police and Suspect Behaviour in The Metropolitan Police in Order to Determine the Effects of New Legislation, Technology and organisational Policies Williamson,T.M (1990 Phd thesis); Police Accountability: The Situation of Complaints in Toronto McMahon,M.1988). Much of the research conducted by legal centres and other groups documents the prevalent nature of police mistreatment. The first survey (1990-91) initiated by the Federation of Community Legal Centres into police mistreatment of young people by police indicated that: 84% of those surveyed were male, 78% were from an English speaking background, 51% were unemployed and 7% were from a professional/non-working class background. Verbal abuse comprised 33% and physical abuse consisted of 29% of the incidents. 31% of cases recorded on survey forms was a police record of interview completed 34% of cases no formal police action was taken 23% were charged by summons, 18% were charged and bailed 20% were kept in cells. Some 64% of respondents indicated that they had not formally reported the incident. 46% of these were either too frightened, feared reprisals, or were threatened, 27% didn't know how to make a complaint, and 22% believed that it would not have made any difference. Of those who had reported only 20% had reported to an authority officially empowered to investigate complaints of police mistreatment. The first surveys' findings are similarly, to a Victorian Council for Civil Liberties telephone survey which found that of those who gave a reason for not formally complaining about police mistreatment, 51% indicated that they feared possible repercussions from formally complaining and 26% believed that "nothing was likely to happen" (Palmer 1992a). A similar survey conducted in Western Australia (N=380) found 60% of respondents had not made a formal complaint and that approximately 50% of these didn't complain because they believed it would be of no use and 28% because of fear of possible repercussions (Hall 1992:10). Existing research also indicates that those most frequently affected are vulnerable people who have little chance of defending themselves. The National Inquiry into Racist Violence heard evidence that many of the attacks upon Aborigines, young and old, were perpetrated by police. Research undertaken in Victoria on homeless young people reports that 47% females and 50% per cent of males reported being physically hurt by police. A report on young people and the police found that police were more likely to be heavyhanded in their dealings with young men, Aboriginal youth and marginal youth. These groups were more likely than other youth to be stopped and spoken to by the police, taken to a police station, and to report being roughed up. A report by G.L.A.D., Gay men and Lesbians Against Discrimination, describes as "the most disturbing aspect" of the survey they undertook, the extent to which gay men and lesbians reported harassment, discrimination and violence at the hands of the police. The 1991 survey undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centres into police mistreatment included a number of examples of police assault on young people and sexual abuse of women. The latest figures indicate that the number of formal complaints against the Victoria Police has risen from 1056 to 4525 since 1988\89. This is an increase of 410% in four years. On the figures currently available there is now one complaint per year for every two sworn police officers in Victoria. Victoria Police have consistently denied the legitimacy of Victorian studies which demonstrate police misbehaviour. Further, while police themselves have recognised that traditional policing has failed Government funding of law and order policies has increased from $M495 in 1988-89 to $M634 in 1991-92 an increase of 30% in 4 years. It appears that police operating budgets have become sacrosanct, the State Government has indicated that police resources and police numbers for 1992-93 would not be cut, despite the massive cutbacks being made to all other state funded services. Ironically, the ineffectiveness of pro-active policing by traditional police forces has been publically expressed. In the 1987-88 Annual Report the Chief Commissioner openly admitted that by themselves the police were unable to reduce crime. In this regard the police have responded to growing concern about police practices, the effectiveness of policing, and police efficiency, by imposing responsibility for crime prevention on the community. While we recognise the possible benefits that can arise out of various community policing initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Police Community Consultative Committees, Police in Schools and via crime prevention programs, the point remains that law and order responses don't work, that the police say that they don't work and therefore rather than pursue more police, more resources, more police powers, and harsher sentencing, we must invest far more in community development. Similarly, the heavy promotion of community policing as an accountability mechanism fails to recognise the serious limits placed on community policing structures. These structures have no control over policing policy and practices and may in fact confuse accountability with public relations rather than a fundamental enhancement of police accountability. This report endeavours to do no more and no less than raise for debate important issues regarding police practices in Victoria. As the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) recently suggested: "the goal of any democratic community should be to have a trustworthy, professional and impartial police force....[t]he present system can be improved by [amongst other things]...most importantly, greater consideration given to the complainant's perception of the [complaints] system."(Perry, B. 1992) We agree totally and present this report on the complainant's views of their experiences of police mistreatment. METHODOLOGY: Some 2,500 survey forms were distributed to community agencies throughout metropolitan and country Victoria (see Appendix 1.) at the beginning of October 1991 seeking information on incidents occurring between June 1991 and January 1992. The survey time frame for return of completed questionnaires was the 4 months between October 1991 and January 1992. A total of 189 survey forms were returned to the Federation. The questionnaire was designed so that it could be completed quickly and simply, and guarantee the confidentiality of the person completing it ( Appendix 2). The 1991-92 survey has incorporated modifications based on information from the previous police survey conducted in 1990-91. The improved format of the 1991-92 survey is designed to provide a more detailed picture about the provision or denial of interpreters during police interviews as well as more detailed information regarding women and mistreatment of victims from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds (NESB). Other changes were also made to assist data-entry and computer analysis. Except where agencies have identified themselves on the form surveys remained anonymous so as to allay respondents' fears about confidentiality. Methodological Limitations: The key limitation on surveys of the type outlined above is that they only document the cases coming to the attention of the relevant agencies and relies on the clients willingness to participate. Police have legitimately criticised previous surveys on these grounds. This criticism can also be applied to police statistics about levels of crime. They are also based only on offences reported to or by police and so reflect response rates rather than true crime rates. Given the mixture of legal workers, para-legals, youth and welfare agency workers who co-operated with the survey, we have obtained a spread of case types beyond those which might normally come to the attention of Community Legal Centres. Nonetheless, we recognise that the method is still limited by the need for the respondents to develop a sense of victimisation and a willingness to at least discuss this with one of the workers who had agreed to facilitate the surveying process. Other limits to the survey include: the survey was conducted in English written form; for self-completion the survey demanded a certain level of literacy skills; cultural factors may have limited the degree of co-operation with the survey; lack of control over sample; sample anonymity precluded follow-up; no information was collected about psychological trauma; agency-worker resistance to surveying; a failure to target Aboriginal agencies All these limitations are more likely to have underestimated the frequency of reported police mistreatment. Furthermore, respondents were given a choice of 14 categories of types of mistreatment (see Section 2.4) to ensure consistency in their responses but only up to three responses were coded as it was felt that the use of three categories would provide sufficient data to provide an understanding of the types of mistreatment being experienced. In effect there are two limits to the use of the data in this question. First, a code was constructed to rank the responses in order of perceived seriousness. While at face value it would appear fairly easy to construct a hierarchy in the response categories available, this contains a danger of imposing the researchers views of seriousness and not that of the victim of the mistreatment. The second limitation to the results in this question is that at the time of completing the forms there were some doubts about whether respondents were able to tick more than one category. Discussions with agency workers who assisted in the completion of the forms confirm that there was some confusion about whether more than one box could be ticked. The impact of this methodological problem is that the extent of mistreatment is likely to be understated.

Of these 25 were received from Western Suburbs Legal Service, 18 from North Melbourne Legal Service, 14 from Flemington Kensington Legal Service, 14 from Essendon Community Legal Service, and 13 from Fitzroy Legal Service. The remaining surveys were received from other Legal Centres as well as 20 other Local Government and other Community based organisations in addition to those received directly from individuals. Each legal service distributed survey forms to local and country community organisations, as well as making survey forms available to their own clients. Each community organisation which acted as a distribution point for the survey was asked to inform community members about the Police Complaints Survey, and encourage and assist them to complete the surveys.

The physical abuse is mainly bruising with a significant amount of cases where the mistreatment results in broken bones. Over half of the cases occur outside normal office hours (ie. 5pm to 9am). 3.

People do not report to the latter categories mainly due to fear and or because they are resigned to the belief that nothing will be achieved by formally complaining.

FEDERATION OF COMMUNITY LEGAL CENTRES REPORT INTO MISTREATMENT BY POLICE 1991-92 Written by: S.Biondo (Community Development Officer-Fitzroy Legal Service) and D.Palmer (Lecturer, Legal Studies Department-LaTrobe University), with the assistance of the Federation of Community Legal Centres Police Issues Working Group. Prepared for the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic.) Police Issues Group, May 1993 Table of Contents Executive Summary Recommendations Other Recommendations Overview Introduction Purpose: Objectives Methodology Principal Findings 1.0 Characteristics of Respondents and Incidents 2.0 Police Behaviour 3.0 Details About the Outcome of the Incident Case Studies Discussion CASE STUDIES Many of the complaints regarding physical abuse involved extreme physical force and several resulted in serious injury to the complainant.The following case studies provide an insight into the sort of mistreatment reported. CASE STUDY 1. The complainant was severely bashed with a torch over the head whilst handcuffed and was then subjected to six hours of systematic beatings at the Brighton police station until such time as he signed a statement. This beating was so severe that the complainant suffered severe bruising, internal injuries, concussion and a fractured skull, which have resulted in ongoing mental, psychological and nervous disorders that have forced the complainant onto sickness benefits. CASE STUDY 2. The complainant was taken to the St.Kilda police station where he was strip searched, hit about the face with heavy belt and buckle, and then handcuffed and laid on his back where he was kicked more than 20 times in the testicles and upper body. As a result of this "interrogation" the complainant suffered severe bruising to the head and chest, and the bruising to his groin was so severe that it was described as "blackened". CASE STUDY 3. The complainant was taken to St.Kilda police station where he was bashed so severely by three officers from the St.Kilda CIB that he suffered two broken ribs and had his arm broken in three places which required a plaster cast for 10 weeks. CASE STUDY 4. In an incident involving St.Kilda police, three Vietnamese men were taken into custody for alleged soliciting. During their 10 hours in custody they where denied interpreters, and were subjected to such physical abuse that one of them was coughing blood upon release and admitted himself immediately to hospital. These men were not only subjected to extreme physical assault, but also experienced both verbal and psychological abuse which appeared to exhibit distinct overtones of racism. None of these men were charged with any offence other than resisting arrest and assaulting police. CASE STUDY 5. The complainant was dragged from his caravan at gun point by members of the Armed Robbery Squad, handcuffed and hooded with a hessian bag secured by a rope around his neck whereupon he was bashed by six police. One officer who bashed and threatened him told him that he had already killed one person. The complainant suffered broken ribs and rope burn to the neck. CASE STUDY 6. The complainant was stopped and dragged from her car by police who handcuffed her and slammed her head into the roof of the car whilst her 15 month old baby sat in the back seat. After she arrived at Fairfield police station she reports that she was kicked so severely in the breast that she still suffered from severe bruising and pain three weeks after the incident. CASE STUDY 7. Another incident involved two officers from the Oakleigh station. The woman involved complained of being bashed over the head with a baton whilst another male officer held her and bent her thumb back almost to breaking point. One of the officers then taunted her with threats of sexual assault. CASE STUDY 8. One of the most serious incidents of police assault was reported by a man who was apprehended in St.Albans and kneed and punched in the process of being taken to the police station. The complainant already had a broken left hand at the time of apprehension. He reports that he was eventually taken to the Sunshine police cells where he was left screaming in pain for three and a half hours. Finally two police officers took him to hospital, during which several threats were made against the complainant that made him fear for his life. The complainant had suffered a broken knee as a result of this incident and was unable to walk, however no assistance was given to him. The complainant reports that four months after the incident he has still not recovered from his injury. CASE STUDY 9. One woman reported that she was picked up in the street and taken to the Moonee Ponds station where she was refused a lawyer and then bashed by an officer resulting in a broken nose. CASE STUDY 10. One man complained of being bashed in a divisional van on the way to Fitzroy police station, where he was forced to "run the gauntlet" of several police officers with batons behind the roller door at the rear of the station. He reports further bashing and kicking whilst being held by Fitzroy CIB resulting in severe bruising to head, back, legs and groin. CASE STUDY 11 - MISUSE OF FIREARMS There were several reported incidents involving police threatening complainants with firearms. i) One man reported that whilst being interviewed by the Armed Robbery Squad at the St.Kilda Road complex he was refused an interpreter and had a gun held to his head and told if he didn't speak he would be shot. ii) Another complainant reported that an officer from Footscray put the complainant's hand on his revolver and warned him that "there's a bullet in here for you". CASE STUDY 12. In another incident the complainant reported that police were called to a party where he was assaulted by two officers who then drove him in the back of a divisional van to Flemington police station. The complainant reports that the officers deliberately drove in a reckless manner causing him to be thrown around the back of the van. Once at the station he was further bashed causing serious head injuries including a punctured eardrum. CASE STUDY 13. A complainant reported that she was grabbed by the hair and kneed in the face by an officer from Flemington police, resulting in a broken nose. CASE STUDY 14. One seventeen year old complainant reported that he was assaulted by two police officers at Rosebud police station. Amongst various physical assaults he was picked up by his collar and belt and swung about the interview room and also held in the air by his ankles and dropped on his head. The officers also warned him that if he made a complaint he would be "dumped off Cape Schanck". CASE STUDY 15. One complainant who was 7 months pregnant at the time reported that seven officers from Flemington burst into her home, grabbed her, pulled her across a coffee table and dragged her to the floor. She was then taken to the bedroom where she was strip searched. The complainant was not charged. She reported that as a result of the incident complications with her pregnancy arose and that the baby was born 6 weeks prematurely due to these complications. A formal complaint was lodged with I.I.D., but the only action taken was to "counsel" the officers involved as to appropriate raid procedures. CASE STUDY 16 - MISUSE OF STRIP SEARCH Other forms of abuse complained of, included a large proportion of strip searches carried out for no particular reason. i) In one incident a Kensington woman who was eight months pregnant reported that she was strip searched after having had her front door broken down by eight police who had a warrant to search for marijuana. ii) Several women reported that they were strip searched by male officers in contravention of Police Standing Orders. iii) One Vietnamese man was strip searched by officers from the Asian squad solely for the purpose of discovering whether he was in possession of firecrackers. iv) Another man reported that he was entrapped and taken in on prostitution charges. At the St.Kilda station he was strip searched and internally searched by officers with a baton. The man reports the manner in which the search took place effectively amounted to rape. v) Another man reported that he was pulled over for drink driving and back at St.Kilda police station he was strip searched in front of female officers whom he states were "just there to watch". vi) In another report, a 15 year old boy detained for criminal damage was forced to strip by an officer from Reservoir, who then forced him to bend over and "spread his cheeks". As noted by the person recording this incident, the boy had no criminal history nor reason to suspect him of drug use, and that the actions of the officer were intended to frighten and humiliate him. CASE STUDY 17 - SOLICITING AND ENTRAPMENT i) A number of incidents related to entrapment, or soliciting. One woman reported that she had just alighted from a taxi when two police officers pulled up and searched her hand bag. When they discovered 3 condoms in her bag she was arrested for soliciting and taken to Elwood for questioning. She reports that at the station she was sexually harassed and strip searched by the two male officers. ii) One man reported that he was approached by a man in public toilets in Melton who made sexual advances toward him. When he responded to these advances the man become became violent and assaulted the complainant and threw him against a brick wall. It was only after this that the man identified himself as a police officer and was joined by another officer. Whilst handcuffed and forced against the wall the complainant was further assaulted by both officers. The complainant was eventually taken back to Melton police station and charged with indecent behaviour and indecent assault. iii) In another incident of entrapment, a man reported that he was approached by a woman in St.Kilda who proposed to have sex with him for an amount of money. It transpired that the woman was an undercover police officer and the complainant was questioned in relation to soliciting. CASE STUDY 18 - FAILURE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PERSON A number of other complaints concerned abuse, threats and denial of independent third parties to people with an intellectual disability. In one instance a man who was registered as a client with the Office of Intellectual Disability Services was taken to City West police station where he was punched in the head and had his head pushed into a table. He was then threatened with further physical assault and verbally abused. He was also refused an independent third party to attend during his two and a half hours in custody. Several other such incidents involved officers from City West, Flemington and Carlton CIB. CASE STUDY 19. Not all reported incidents of police mistreatment concerned direct abuse to the complainant. One report described an incident in a Collingwood street where two police officers in a car had verbally abused a seventeen year old man in the street and then taken off, in the process of which they side-swiped a parked vehicle and drove off without stopping. CASE STUDY 20. One complainant reported that his shop was raided by more than 25 police officers in search of drugs, which resulted in extensive damage to the interior and structure of the building. He also reported that officers had shot dead his dogs during the raid. The complainant was not charged with any offence and has yet to receive any compensation for the damage incurred. CASE STUDY 21. Another complainant from Kensington reported that five police officers from the Major Crime Squad smashed down her front door at 4.30 in the morning with sledgehammers. As she stated in her report, she would have answered the door had they knocked. The complainant has also received no compensation despite the fact that no charges were laid. RESPONDENTS GENERAL COMMENTS RE: POLICE PRACTICES The survey forms offered the complainants an opportunity to make comments about the incident or police practices in general. i) One complainant commented that his experience with the police made him feel "powerless and under the oppression of fascists". ii) Another complainant, originally from South America, had his door smashed down by a group of police who then assaulted him. He commented that he believed the Victoria police could be likened to the death squads in El Salvador. iii) Other complainants indicated that police mistreatment was a common occurrence, with comments such as "this happens on a regular basis", and "this is only one of the many experiences I have had with the police". iv) One complainant commented that he would never believe or trust the police again, whilst another commented that he would not advise his children to go to the police even if they were lost or in need of assistance. He added that he didn't feel that he could call the police in the event that he was the victim of a crime. v) One victim of police assault commented "the police wonder why Walsh Street happened". Another simply said that he didn't think young people should be treated in such a manner. vi) Another said that he thought that the law should apply to the police in the same way that it applies to citizens. vii) Some complainants commented on how terrified they were of the police as a result of the incident. One complainant, concerned about the confidentiality of the survey, commented that if the officer involved knew that he was reporting the incident he would be shot, and that he did not expect to walk out of the police station next time, as he took threats to shoot him seriously. This man's report made numerous references to threats made to him by a particular officer from the St.Kilda CIB, and he was in genuine fear of his life. viii) Another complainant summed up the incident with..."In all, it was a terrifying day and night, ... they seemed inhuman ..." and described the incident as "terrorism and a gross abuse of power". ix) Other complainants commented on their lack of faith in the complaints process. One commented that he felt that there were no avenues of complaint with any hope of success, whilst another said that he had made a complaint but there had been "a big cover-up by Internal Investigations". x) One complainant who has an intellectual disability and was bashed by police reported that he was told by the officers involved that if he did not pursue the complaint "nothing else would happen to him". xi) Another complainant, referring to a previous incident, reported that he had made an official complaint to I.I.D., but had been "bullied and conned" into retracting his complaint as part of a deal concerning the charges laid against him. He further commented that the officers involved reneged on the deal and that he was treated more harshly than if he hadn't complained in the first place. xii) Another complainant reported that she had made a complaint against the officers involved which was substantiated but which resulted in no disciplinary action against the officers involved. She commented that she was frustrated at the lack of action taken by the I.I.D., and as a result she would consider taking her own civil action against the officers in an attempt to achieve a remedy. xiii) Another complainant who had been subjected to continued harassment and racial abuse by an officer from Brunswick stated that he was concerned that if he made a formal complaint he would be on the end of a "Chicago BYO", referring to the reputation of the Chicago police of planting drugs and carrying extra unregistered firearms. In short, he felt that he would be further victimised if he made a complaint. Several reported incidents involved the Transit Police. Most of these incidents involved abuse, intimidation and harassment of young people. DISCUSSION The information collected in this 1992 Federation of Community Legal Services survey accords with previous research. Although selection of respondents to the survey was unable to ensure that they represented the community or the population who interact with police or even the people who are mistreated by police, substantial similarities between all the studies undertaken in Victoria and elsewhere create a definite pattern of information about police misbehaviour and victims' responses to it. In particular, the survey data support assertions that those who become victims of police mistreatment are minority and powerless members of the community: - Between 70% and 80% of victims are men - At least 60% of victims are aged under 30 years - Most victims are not in the workforce. About 40% are unemployed and another 30% are students or pensioners - People with non English speaking backgrounds are over represented among victims who complain - Independent interpreters were not provided for 70% of victims who have difficulty with the English language. - Half of the victims have been previously mistreated by police - Only 20% of victims use formal report mechanisms such as the Internal Investigations Department of Victoria Police and the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) - Fear of repercussions and cynicism about the usefulness of existing formal complaint systems are the most usual reason given for not formally reporting the incident. However, many victims remained ignorant of their right to complain despite Victoria Police Standing Orders which require Watch House Sergeants to provide this information - Up to 30% of victims were abused and detained without subsequent charges being laid. This survey exposes these general characteristics of victims of police abuse. The data indicate that most incidents involve several uniformed police officers of constable rank and that the incidents usually occur in police stations or private homes. In 12 cases, the Transit Police were involved. Analysis of individual incidents indicates that mistreatment by several police is not necessarily related to the strength and gender of the victim or refusal to cooperate. Mistreatment which occurs in police stations is more likely to inflict and result in physical injury, particularly bruising and broken bones. The frequency is not influenced by the victims, gender, age or language preference. In contrast, injuries inflicted at home are more likely to involve women and respondents aged over 25 years. The survey indicates that victims fear of reporting incidents through formal channels is greater in non English speakers. Comments made by some non English speakers indicates that this fear may be engendered by their perception of similarities in and their experiences with Australian police and those in their country of origin. Further, there is evidence that Anglo Australian cynicism about the formal complaints system is justified. In his report about the Queensland police Fitzgerald commented, "Practical considerations both inhibit complaints against the police and help to ensure the observance of the code [that the law not be enforced against police]. Both honest police and civilians who report police misconduct risk serious detriment with little prospect of appropriate action." Evidence gathered in the course of this survey also supports another of Fitzgerald's findings that, "Any person, who accuses or criticises a police officer also faces other, graver risks ranging from trumped up charges perhaps involving planted or fabricated evidence, to violence". The current system for making complaints against police is not taken seriously by violent police. Those who become victims of police attacks have little success in bringing those police officers involved to justice. Usually it is the word of the often more than one police officers involved against one individual. Police culture which places a higher value on "sticking together" is a significant factor to be reckoned with, and is a significant inhibitor to those deciding to make a complaint of police mistreatment. There are many issues to be considered when discussing police culture, in particular a value system where loyalty to the force often equals protection of fellow officers from investigation. It could be suggested that police complaints authorities need greater input into police recruitment and training policy and investigative and punitive powers to ensure deterrent effect. Further and somewhat ironically, even the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints), who is responsible for monitoring police practices, and is uniquely placed to provide such information, fails to give full account of police practices. Palmer (1992) has argued that the Deputy Ombudsman's Annual Reports need to explain the results of his work rather than merely report them. In his most recent Annual Report, he even took to task critics of the process for handling police complaints while offering no hints about any limitations to the current system. Clearly, there is a divergence in the ways of understanding police complaints. Community Legal Centres believe that Victorian Police have progressively become more isolated and alienated from local communities. The very nature of a very large, highly mobile and transient force is undoubtably an important factor leading to this two way split. Attempts at community police liaison and developments such as police community consultative committees (P.C.C.C.) have generally not been successful. This may be because of the perception of local communities, which view these developments as police controlled public relations exercises rather than genuine attempts to develop accountability and dialogue with local communities. These local committees have never possessed any real decision making powers, and on occasions have been subject to directions higher in the police force quashing local community initiatives aimed at developing local accountability. There can be no substitute for the development of real dialogue and accountability of police to their local communities. What is needed is local management committees with real powers to direct the use of police resources available to their community, including the prioritising of police work in the prevention and detection of crime within that community. Clearly appropriate guidelines need to be established for the operation of community management structures for police. Much work needs to be done to ensure that these management committees are appropriately resourced. These committees should be provided with guidelines, developed in consultation with the community, that balance the need to protect individuals rights from unnecessary interference and arrest, against the need of the community to implement effective crime prevention and an adequate response when crime does occur. As of the present time no government in Victoria has yet addressed the widening gap between police and local communities. The future safety of our community requires a move away from police officers barricaded from the community by roller doors, high security fences, and motor vehicle windows two thirds closed. These images tell the community that the police do no trust the community and therefore are not to be trusted themselves. The development of local community management structures must not be left in the hands of the police force, but rather with the appropriate input from bodies such as the Law Reform Committees, Ethnic Communities, Womens Groups, Youth Organisations and local government to name a few of the obvious participants. More police, with more powers and more community alienating equipment is not the solution. More can be done with less in the area of Policing, what is really needed is a different style for achieving outcomes. What is required in Victoria is a radical rethink of the direction in which our police force is going and the way in which our police are held accountable to local communities. Under the current system, most complaints about police are investigated by police from the same district in which the officer complained about is stationed, under direction from the Internal Investigations Department or the Deputy Ombudsman. Whilst the task of this report was not to collect data on police investigation of complaints, it is worth noting that the experience of Community Legal Centres indicates that often police investigate those for whom they have a direct line of responsibility. Such a system may be a convenient means of investigating complaints but it undermines any confidence or faith an individual may have, particularly if they have been strip searched, beaten, confined and subsequently threatened with reprisals if they complained about their treatment. These circumstances regardless of the best intentioned motives of the investigators involved clearly compromises the independence of any subsequent investigation. It is imperative that a broad based, impartial, independent and well resourced police complaints mechanism be established. This survey indicates that community workers are more likely than the formal complaint system to receive complaints. Community Legal Centre workers have assisted clients who have been mistreated, falsely charged or harassed in making a complaint against police. The police and the Government seem unable to understand that the real issue underlying the low formal complaint rate of victims is distrust and fear of those to whom they must complain rather than unwillingness to complain per se. Therefore it is crucial that development of any new police complaints system include full community consultation. The development of an independent community visitors scheme with powers to randomly visit police stations, to protect the rights of individuals in custody is urgent. The establishment of independent community visitors schemes covering all police stations in Victoria is in the interests of the police, members of the public taken into police custody, and the Victorian community in general. An added benefit of such an approach if properly implemented is that of making the police directly accountable to the community that they are serving. Such measures have already been implemented in some parts of England.

FEDERATION OF COMMUNITY LEGAL CENTRES REPORT INTO MISTREATMENT BY POLICE 1991-92 Written by: S.Biondo (Community Development Officer-Fitzroy Legal Service) and D.Palmer (Lecturer, Legal Studies Department-LaTrobe University), with the assistance of the Federation of Community Legal Centres Police Issues Working Group. Prepared for the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic.) Police Issues Group, May 1993 Table of Contents Executive Summary Recommendations Other Recommendations Overview Introduction Purpose: Objectives Methodology Principal Findings 1.0 Characteristics of Respondents and Incidents 2.0 Police Behaviour 3.0 Details About the Outcome of the Incident Case Studies Discussion Commentary and Recommendations conclusion COMMENTARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS The following section provides a commentary and recommendations on numerous issues raised in the course of this report. It also raises some other issues of concern in other areas of policing and makes recommendations specific to these areas as well. 1. The Role of the Police and The Media: The Role of the Police and The Media: The relationship between the police and the media while understandably close under certain circumstances can lead to a reliance by journalists on police as their source of information. It is common practice for the police media unit to selectively release details about crimes which support police claims of a "crime problem". It is most important that the use of police resources be used wisely, efficiently and in a non-discriminatory manner. Not to do so may lead to claims of the police manipulating "moral panics" and the abuse of current police powers. The role of an impartial, independent and well resourced Bureau of Crime Statistics is most important if truly effective crime prevention strategies are to be developed and implemented. Recommendation: That the Crime Statistics Unit currently housed within the Department of Justice (the same Department covering the Police) be disbanded Recommendation : The "independent" Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research be re-established in Victoria. That its workings be overseen by an independent board. That every attempt be made to de-politicise the selective gathering and presentation of statistics. 2. Independent Community Visitors Scheme The descriptive data presented in this report supports the experience of Community Legal Centres in identifying that the largest number of complaints about mistreatment by police relate to events that take place in police stations. Despite the long term existence of Police complaints mechanisms it is of considerable concern that no local initiatives have been implemented to address the need for a preventative independent accountability mechanism for the operation of police stations. The development of an independent community visitors scheme with powers to randomly visit police stations, to protect the rights of individuals in custody is urgent. The establishment of independent community visitors schemes covering all police stations in Victoria is in the interests of the police, members of the public taken into police custody, and the Victorian community in general. An added benefit of such an approach if properly implemented is that of making the police directly accountable to the community that they are serving. Such measures have already been implemented in some parts of England. Recommendation: That a community visitors scheme with powers to randomly visit police stations be implemented throughout Victoria. Recommendation : That community visitors have the right to unimpeded freedom of movement throughout the police station and the legislative capacity to formally report activities, circumstances and recommendations to the responsible authorities for further investigation and action. Recommendation : That it be a criminal offence for police to obstruct a community visitor in the course of their duties. 3. Strip Searches And Photographs In contrast to the existing controls over police powers regarding fingerprints and blood samples, (which up until May 1993) have been under some limited independent accountability through the Magistrates' Courts, there has been no legislative protection introduced in relation to strip searches, internal body searches, frisktype searches, or the taking of photographs of individuals being investigated by the police. Fundamental issues of accountability and legislative protection are absent in relation to the most basic of all human rights, namely the protection and dignity of our bodies. The experience of Community Legal Centres and Community Groups supported by this reports findings identify numerous issues which require urgent legislative action. Recommendation : Unless life is at risk body searches and strip searches should be banned. Under most circumstances prior to police initiating a strip search or body search Police should be required to seek the consent of a Magistrate and if the body search is to occur that it only occur with the assistance of a Medical Practitioner. Recommendation : It should be a criminal offence for strip searches to be conducted by members of the opposite sex. Recommendation : That a register be established and an independent monitoring mechanism be established to oversight the use of strip searches and their proper and improper use by police. 4. Development Of Local Police Accountability Legal Centres believe that the Victorian Police Force has progressively become more isolated and alienated from its local communities. The very nature of a very large, highly mobile and transient force is undoubtably an important factor leading to this two way split. Attempts at community police liaison and developments such as police community consultative committees (P.C.C.C.) have generally not been successful often because of the perception of local communities, which view these developments as police controlled public relations exercises rather than genuine attempts to develop accountability and dialogue with local communities. These local committees have never possessed any real decision making powers, and on occasions have been subject to directions higher in the police force quashing local community initiatives aimed at developing local accountability. There can be no substitute for the development of real dialogue and accountability of police to their local communities. What is needed is local management committees with real powers to direct the use of police resources available to their community, including the prioritising of police work in the prevention and detection of crime within that community. Clearly appropriate guidelines need to be established for the operation of community management structures for police. Much work needs to be done to ensure that these management committees are appropriately resourced. These committees should be provided with guidelines, developed in consultation with the community, that balance the need to protect individuals rights from unnecessary interference and arrest, against the need of the community to implement effective crime prevention and an adequate response when crime does occur. As of the present time no government in Victoria has yet addressed the widening gap between police and local communities. The future safety of our community requires a move away from police officers barricaded from the community by roller doors, high security fences, and motor vehicle windows two thirds closed. These images tell the community that the police do no trust the community and therefore are not to be trusted themselves. The development of local community management structures must not be left in the hands of the police force, but rather with the appropriate input from bodies such as the Law Reform Committees, Ethnic Communities, Womens Groups, Youth Organisations and local government to name a few of the obvious participants. More police, with more powers and more community alienating equipment is not the solution. More can be done with less in the area of Policing, what is really needed is a different style for achieving outcomes. What is required in Victoria is a radical rethink of the direction in which our police force is going and the way in which our police are held accountable to local communities. Recommendation: That the role and function of PCCC's be independently evaluated and monitored. 5. Complaints Against Police: Under the current system the great majority of the complaints about police are in fact investigated not by the Internal Investigations Department nor the Deputy Ombudsman but by police from the same district which the officer complained about comes from. Community sentiment about the continued investigation of Caesar by Caesar could at best be described as cynical. At worst, this system of complaint procedures could be viewed with complete disrespect and loss of faith in the law and the Victoria Police Force. Whilst the task of this report was not to collect data on police investigation of complaints, it is worth noting that the experience of Community Legal Centres indicates that often police investigate those for whom they have a direct line of responsibility. Such a system undermines any confidence or faith an individual may have particularly if they have been strip searched, beaten, confined and subsequently threatened with reprisals if they complained about their treatment. If the growing loss of legitimacy of the Victoria Police is to at all be abated this most fundamental issue of police accountability must be addressed. The Victoria Police Force has long been criticised for the manner in which complaints have been handled by the force. A 1971 review by an English inspector indicated that there were no systematic records of complaints and that local police had significant powers in determining whether complaints were officially recorded and sent to police headquarters.(Goldsmith 1991 p22). The Beach Inquiry into allegations against members of the Victoria Police from 1976-78 found that little had changed. More recently an internal review in 1987 also criticised police response to people wishing to make complaints.(Richardson, J. 1987) and Melbourne Age journalists found in 1989 that in a survey of suburban police stations "very few police officers approached indicated any familiarity with complaint recording procedures". (Goldsmith 1991 p22) This suggests the need for a thorough and systematic review of police complaints in Victoria. Recommendation: That the Government implement a review of Police accountability in Victoria. It is almost 20 years since any major review of police malpractice has occurred and given the dramatic increase in complaints it is time to review police complaints and police accountability in Victoria. Recommendation: It is imperative that a broad based, impartial, independent and well resourced Police Complaints mechanism be established. Recommendation: That in examining the type of structure to be established, due and proper consultation occur with the community. Recommendation: Such a structure should have powers to refer criminal charges to the Department of Public Prosecutions and to impose other disciplinary sanctions against police officers. Recommendation: Such a structure should have a clear Government mandate to make recommendations on police procedure and practices, recruitment and training policies. Recommendation: That Representatives from the Federation of Community Legal Centres and the Chief Commissioner of Police meet at regular briefing sessions to exchange information on various aspects of policing in Victoria. Recommendation: That a formal mechanism be put in place for the reporting by the judiciary of instances of police malpractice which have been identified in courts. Recommendation: That formal mechanisms be introduced to allow victims of police mistreatment to be kept fully informed of the progress of their complaint to the authorities. Recommendation: That the Ombudsman immediately investigate ways of addressing the low substantiation rates of current police complaints, particularly allegations of assault and harassment. Recommendation: That the process for dealing with proven cases of mistreatment be open to public scrutiny and input as these are community matters. 6. Exercise Of Police Powers The extensive powers given to the Victoria Police represent a substantial privilege that has been bestowed upon them by the rest of the community. There are no systematic accountability procedures in place to ensure that these privileges are properly exercised and no measures to counter the actual or perceived institutionalised abuse of powers which may have developed within the Victoria Police. Legislation granting rights to people in police custody provides no penalties against police officers who abuse those rights and no other mechanism is available to effectively complain. There are no penalties imposed on police officers in relation to the denial of rights given to members of the community. This basic level of accountability is exactly what police are demanding for other members of the community who breach the law and fundamental human rights. There is an urgent need for regular independent audits of the exercise of all Victorian police powers, in particular powers relating to the following: 6.1 Granting and Refusal of Bail Granting and Refusal of Bail Far too many people are being placed on bail unnecessarily in relation to summary offences. Police also have extensive powers to oppose the granting of bail to people charged with offences. 6.2 The Taking of Fingerprints The Taking of Fingerprints Since the introduction of the Crimes (Fingerprinting) Act 1988, police have taken more sets of prints from suspects annually than prior to the implementation of the Act. The State Government is currently proposing to widen police powers to take fingerprints, by allowing police to take fingerprints from anyone over the age of 15 suspected of committing any offence no matter how minor the offence be it an indictable or summary offence. This results in the courts having a reduced role or no role at all to play in monitoring the exercise of police power in relation to such people who refuse to give their fingerprints. Furthermore, police will be able to use reasonable force against such people who refuse to give their fingerprints. The result of these proposed increases in police powers further reduces police accountability which is currently afforded to citizens through the appeal of fingerprinting requests to the Magistrates Court. Considerable concern is expressed in regards to the more than likely increased abuse of Community members interacting with the police, whilst at the same time these proposed changes will have no impact on crime prevention and solution. 6.3 Requesting Name and Address Requesting Name and Address The State Government is currently proposing legislation to make it an offence for people to refuse to give their name and address to police who believe on reasonable grounds that they may have committed (or about to commit) an offence. This unnecessary offence will result in more people being taken into police custody, thus causing a likely increase in police mistreatment against those people in custody. In South Australia where police have such a power, 20% of people charged with failing to give a name and address on demand were only charged with that offence. 6.4 Search Warrants Search Warrants Search warrants are issued far too easily, and in some circumstances members of the public complain of being presented with unsigned search warrants or warrants authorising searches of premises other than the one the police wish to search. 6.5 The taking of blood and other body samples The taking of blood and other body samples Although body samples are not often taken, and are subject to some independent scrutiny of the Magistrates' Court, an ongoing audit and assessment of the use of this power is also necessary in the interest of an efficient and accountable police force and for the protection of all citizens. Of particular concern is that the State Government is currently proposing that the class of body samples include such things as pubic hair, anal swabs, genital swabs, breast swabs, saliva, mouth scrapings, dental impressions, and finger and toe-nail matter. The notion that police will be able to use reasonable force to take such samples, once they have a court order, is abhorrent, and clearly open to abuse. The potential for the type of abuse which currently occurs through police strip searching women suspects, and to extend this to the taking of intrusive body samples is an issue of major concern. 6.6 Preliminary breath testing Preliminary breath testing Although a reasonably well accepted procedure by the community, a careful audit of this power needs to be undertaken on a regular basis, particularly in relation to charges of refusal to take a breath test, where there are allegations of abuse by the police. 6.7 Questioning & Police Custody Questioning & Police Custody The length of time which people are detained in police custody for the purposes of questioning should be strictly monitored to ensure that the most basic of individual rights, i.e. not to be unnecessarily detained, is protected. Special attention must be given to situations where people are held in police detention for questioning and either no charges, or charges for offences against the police officers, namely hindering, resisting arrest, and assaulting police are laid. 6.8 Legal Representation Legal Representation Although provision is made in the Crimes Actfor an individual's right to contact a legal representative the provision of legal advice by a solicitor when arrested must be made mandatory, as is the case in other democratic societies. Currently if police act in accordance to the law a suspect will be permitted to telephone a lawyer. Such a right is only of use to those persons who have twentyfour hour access to a legal representative. There is an urgent need for a twentyfour hour legal service available to all persons held in police custody. This mandatory right should apply irrespective of age, race, background or severity of charge. 6.9 The provision of interpreters The provision of interpreters There is no proper accountability required of police in relation to the provision of interpreters for people from a non English speaking background who do not have a sufficient command of English. Studies in the area have shown that police are very reluctant to use interpreters, and the only accountability applied to police is if the Record of Interview is challenged in a later court proceeding. There are no adequate records kept indicating the adequacy of police use of interpreters, and no clear guidelines requiring the police to make use of interpreters. 6.9.1 Independent Third persons Independent Third persons The use of Independent Third Persons in situations where the person in custody for questioning and investigation is under the age of 17, or has an intellectual or mental impairment, also requires proper accountability to be developed to ensure that police comply with the legal requirements in this area. The situation in relation to people with intellectual or mental impairments needs to be given legislative protection. Proper guidelines need to be developed for police to guide them in the exercise of this power, and to monitor the implementation of the power. 6.9.2 Truncheons and handcuffs Truncheons and handcuffs There are no adequate accountability procedures in relation to the use by the Victoria Police of various items of equipment carried by them as a matter of course. Police must be held accountable for the use of handcuffs, truncheons and other items used for detention or forceful arrest or entry. These items have been provided to our police force as part of the responsibility and privilege accorded to police officers because of their unique role in society. The failure of successive governments to address accountability of the police use of these items has allowed an attitude to develop in the police force that police will not be held accountable for the use of these items no matter how inappropriately they might be used. To be unreasonably or improperly detained in handcuffs or beaten by police batons is a criminal offence regardless of whether the person carrying out the action is or is not a police officer. Police must be made accountable to ensure that this equipment is only used when necessary and required by the situation. Recommendation: That the State Government withdraw its proposed legislation to increase police powers with respect to taking fingerprints, body-samples and demanding names and addresses from suspects. Recommendation: Section 464C of the Crimes Act should be amended to make it a criminal offence for a police officer to deny a suspect the right to communicate with a friend, relative or legal practitioner. Recommendation: Section 464D of the Crimes Act should be amended to make it a criminal offence for a police officer to fail to get an "independent third person" when required. Recommendation: That a police powers monitoring authority be established to independently monitor and review the use and abuse of existing police powers. Recommendation: That if victim impact statements are to be used in Victoria they should also be used in Police mistreatment cases. 7. Gun Control & Police Firearms It is of crucial importance for the community and government to ensure that police officers do not endanger themselves or the community by frequent and unnecessary resort to firearms. In the two years between 1987 and 1989 Victoria Police shot and killed eleven citizens. In ten out of these eleven shootings the police were not themselves being shot at. In at least seven out of the eleven shootings the deceased either did not have a gun or did not have a gun capable of firing. Four of those shot and killed were shot in the back, three dying of bullet wounds to the back of the head. Due to the number of shootings and their controversial circumstances the Coroner has conducted a lengthy investigation into seven of them. As of May 1993 the findings are still being awaited. The accidental firing of guns by police or deliberate discharge of guns in circumstances that endanger the public are events which occur with alarming regularity. Beyond the total removal of guns from all police and the total banning of their use in the community it is imperative that the use and abuse of firearms by police be more closely scrutinised and that improved training and procedures for handling and intervention be implemented. Survey respondents made a number of allegations of police using their firearms to abuse members of the public. Weapons are not toys, their abuse must be sanctioned. The community should not accept anything less than a least restrictive force approach from its "guardians". Any policy which purports to address the issue of public safety and gun control must address the way that 10,000 armed police use their firearms. Recommendation: That the Government in consultation with Police and the Community undertake a major review of Police Gun policy. Recommendation: Victoria Police adopt a "least restrictive force" policy and that part of this policy focus on measures to eliminate the use of firearms. Recommendation: Police Officers who are still in their probationary period of training be banned from carrying guns for the period of their probation. Recommendation: That the right to refuse to carry weapons by police officers be more actively promoted and the right to carry arms should be limited to certain areas of police activity 8. Specialist Squads At various times there is considerable concern regarding the operations of specialist squads such as the Major Crime squad (now disbanded), the Armed Robbery squad, the Asian squad, and the Special Operations group. There exists a strong need to review the existence of these squads and for the implementation of effective and strict accountability of any specialist squads that are considered necessary. These specialist squads have been and are still able to act in a total void of accountability to the outside community and to the Parliament of Victoria. The nature of complaints about the operations of these squads indicate that even the most senior levels of police management have very little control over the operations of these sections of the police force. It is the clear impression of legal centres, based on complaints made to us that these squads have become a law unto themselves. Community Legal Centres have seen too many people whose treatment at the hands of these squads can best be described as torture. The methods used by these squads are of far greater danger to the community than most of the people against whom they direct their ruthless tactics. Recommendation: That Specialist Police Squads be disbanded. Failing this preferred option to disband, regular independent judicial reviews of the activities of these remaining squads should occur. These reviews should call for public comment and findings be made public. 9. Police Training Whilst police in Victoria have made substantial gains in pay and other benefits over the last decade very little work has been done to ensure that they receive adequate training in relation to dealing with young people, dealing with people from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and the development of more sophisticated and less confrontational tactics when dealing with the public. The 19 week training course currently provided to Victorian police while objective in many of its educational aims can be considered to be grossly inadequate in others. Despite significant increases in budgetary allocations over the past 10 years, it would appear that the Victoria Police have not chosen to give as high a priority to training as is required. Recent developments in police training in NSW and Queensland provide interesting models for consideration. Recommendation: That an open inquiry be held into the training needs of the Victoria Police Force. Such an inquiry should consider the benefits of establishing a more substantial and thorough recruit training course. It should also consider the benefits of promoting tertiary education of force members within regular educational establishments. Incentives for such training should be made available and applicants should be supported financially and be duly recognised by the Force. 10. Access To Justice The impact of police abuse of powers on access to justice There is a need to address the effect of an increased imbalance between police powers and resources and access to justice in the criminal justice system as a whole. While Police numbers and resources have increased, along with allegations of Police misconduct there has been no equivalent increase to legal aid funding. The Legal Aid Commission of Victoria refused almost 30% of legal aid applications for the period ending 30th June 1992 compared to 20% for the period ending 30th June 1991. Whilst 85% of legal aid recipients are living below the poverty line, many people unable to afford legal costs are not receiving any legal assistance due to more stringent legal aid guidelines. The Legal Aid Commission has had to increasingly reject applications due to significant budgetary constraints. Government funding has not kept pace with the increasing cost of cases due to their increased complexity and length. The failure of Governments to address the direct correlation between the impact on the demand for legal aid and increased police resources and powers could be interpreted by some that there is no longer a genuine commitment to justice in our community. People facing criminal charges in Victoria are now regularly being refused legal aid even when they have a very sound defence to the charge against them, on the grounds that they are unlikely to go to prison or receive substantial fines. These people are not in a position to be able to afford the cost of legal representation and are pleading guilty and being convicted simply because they have no means by which to present their case to the courts. The number of people appearing before Magistrates' Courts without the benefit of legal representation is rising dramatically probably for the first time since the development of Community Legal Centres in the early 1970's and the creation of Legal Aid Commissions in the early 80's. It is crucial for Government to address the direct correlation between the impact on the demand for legal aid and increased police resources and powers. Legal Aid impact statements should be considered as a matter of course whenever new legislation is being considered. Such statements should detail the effect on legal aid services, the court system and the corrections system of any legislative changes which in this instance would increase with police powers and resources. Linked to this, appropriate funding must be made available to ensure that the other parts of our criminal justice system are able to adequately deal with the flowon effect of these changes. Recommendations: Legal Aid Impact statements should be introduced as a matter of course whenever an increase in police powers or resources is occurring or new legislation is being considered. Such statements would detail the financial impact on the Criminal Justice System. Financial allowance compensating for the downstream impact of such powers or legislative change needs to be addressed. 11. On The Spot Fines It has been said that the greater use of "on the spot" fines for a wide range of offences will relieve the workload of the police and the court system. In the 199091 financial year the Victoria Police collected $35 million in on the spot fines. Although having some benefits this system is "regressive' as it disadvantages some people more than others because of the fixed nature of the fines and peoples varying ability to pay. The fines have vastly different impacts on different people because they take no account of a persons income or ability to pay. Many Victorian's are faced with heavy fines of this nature at a time when they are suffering great economic hardship. Most alarming however is that ordinary people have no hope of challenging them once they have been issued. Many people complain that some police officers incorrectly or unfairly issue such fines. It is not possible to get legal aid to challenge the fines and most people are not confident enough to put their story at court without legal representation and with the risk of receiving an even higher fine. It is true that on the spot fines save police and court time but some would say that this is high cost to freedom if it makes police officers judge and jury, and with the only real alternative for some who cannot afford to pay to spend time in jail. Recommendation: That a review be held into the operation of on the spot fines and that consideration be given to establishing a mechanism where complaints or objections are able to be heard in an informal and cost free environment. The review should also consider the introduction of a variable or progressive scale of fines which takes into account each persons ability to pay. 12. Victimless Crime When the Victorian Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research released its 1991-92 Crime Statistics, one of the strongest trends revealed by the Bureau was the concentration of police resources on victimless crimes. Such findings are important in light of the significant policing of groups such as the young, Aboriginals, Public Housing Tenants and other groups often referred to as moral or victimless crime policing areas. The disproportionate concentration of police resources on prostitution and minor drug users raises serious questions about police practices and priorities which are out of step with community attitudes. 12. 1 Minor drug use Minor drug use According to National Drug Offensive Surveys, the use of drugs in Victoria has remained constant since 1988. However the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research shows offences relating to Cannabis made up 79% of all drug offences an increase of 31% over the previous year. Marijuana use is widespread amongst Victorians and Australians in general. The targeting of this drug by police and the enormous resources required for this throughout the criminal justice system could be considered as an area for substantial law reform. Various Australian State initiatives currently exist which aim at decriminalisation and shifting Police resources into other more critical areas. Such law reform initiatives within the local context could be considered as a prime area for cost efficiencies and more appropriate allocation of resources. Recommendation : That the State Government initiate law reform measures aimed at legalisation or decriminalisation of minor drug use based on similar initiatives implemented in other Australian States. 12.2. Prostitution Prostitution According to the 1991-92 Victorian Police Statistical Review of Crime, police filed charges against 741 people for offences related to prostitution. In comparison 1987-88 figures show 366 people were charged. The increase in prostitution related offences is an example of an increased vigilance in "moral" policing which is clearly out of step with community attitudes. 12.3 Homosexual Sex Homosexual Sex The charges of soliciting against Bishop Dowling, recently dropped by the DPP were considered "...trivial and involved no victim in any accepted sense", according to Mr Bernard Bongiorno, QC (Sunday Age 30/8/92). The Chairman of the Law Reform Commission Mr David Kelly commented; "The sort of thing alleged against Bishop Dowling doesn't seem the thing that criminal law should be concerned with. There are many more serious crimes. It's most unfortunate that we should bother with that". 12.4. Drunk in a public place, indecent language and obscene behaviour Drunk in a public place, indecent language and obscene behaviour Offences such as drunk in a public place, indecent language and obscene behaviour are often used as pretexts for taking people into custody, detaining them for a number of hours, and then subsequently charging them. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended that the offence of public drunkenness be abolished, and that people should not be arrested and charged for just using offensive language. On the issue of public drunkenness, a number of incidents of physical and verbal abuse arise following arrests for drunkenness. It is recommended that adequately funded programs to establish and maintain non-custodial facilities for the care and treatment of intoxicated persons should be established and that legislation should place a statutory duty upon police to consider and utilise these alternatives. Police should not be the sole arbiters in deciding on these alternatives. It is clear from the experience of Community Legal Centres that police use the charges of drunk and other summary offences to give them powers of arrest in the street to deal with a range of situations. 12.5 Offensive Language Offensive Language Police often use the charge of Offensive Language to assert their authority over people they deal with and also to control or diffuse situations. It should be emphasised that often the language used that forms the substance of this offence, is widely used in the community, and is also in common usage in the police force itself. It is submitted that this is another example of "moral" policing, which is out of step with community attitudes, and is no longer appropriate to be covered by the criminal law area. Recommendation: In line with Recommendation 79 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody(RCIAD) and the Victorian Law Reform Commission Reports No. 25 and 32 the offence of public drunkenness should be abolished. Further in line with Recommendation 86 of the (RCIAD), people should not be arrested and charged for just using offensive language. Recommendation: In line with Recommendation 80 of the RCIADC it is recommended that adequately funded programs to establish and maintain non-custodial facilities for the care and treatment of intoxicated persons should be established and that legislation should place a statutory duty upon police to consider and utilise these alternatives. Police should not be the sole arbiters in deciding on these alternatives. CONCLUSION It is the experience of legal centres that violence by police contributes significantly to violence in the community. The findings presented in this report objectively affirm this view. The data collected from this survey contributes to the growing amount of research on the nature and extent of police mistreatment of citizens. These results are worrying as they indicate a high level of fear and mistrust of the current process for handling complaints against the police. There is also a large number of people that are not aware how to complain. Almost half of those who complain do so to a lawyer and a further one third of the total sample had discussed the issue with a community worker. This suggests that their is a vital role to be played by lawyers and community workers and that there is a need to ensure that these professions are fully conversant with the police complaints process and that they also understand the level of fear and mistrust that the public has of the police complaints process. There is a great need for Government and a cross section of the community participation to be more involved in directing policing practices and priorities towards a crime prevention framework with appropriate accountability mechanisms. Discussion and debate must continue as to all aspects of policing and an honest appraisal of what needs to be improved developed. The real issues in achieving crime prevention and law enforcement must be tackled in a de-politicised way. The failure of Political Parties of all persuasions in Victoria to address the important issue of accountability of a major government department with an annual budget in excess of $600 million and which represents an armed force of over 10,000 individuals raises serious questions for Democracy and Justice in our society.

INTRODUCTION The principal aim of the Crimes Compensation Tribunal (hereaftercalled CCT) is to provide an informal, compassionate and efficientforum for victims of crime. The fulfillment of such aims, particularlyin the area of sexual assault, requires awareness and understandingof the sensitivity of the issues involved. The 22nd Annual Report of the Crimes Compensation Tribunal, theReport for the year 1993/1994 states that "the principalaim of the Crimes Compensation Tribunal is to provide an informal,compassionate and efficient forum for victims of crime".Whilst the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1983 does not specificallyset out the philosophy behind the legislation it is inherent withinthe specific purposes of the legislation, the informality allowedwithin the Tribunal, the lack of a requirement that there be aconviction, and the presumption that hearings shall be in private,all point to a philosophical underpinning. This philosophicalunderpinning aims to ensure that the process for obtaining CrimesCompensation that does not re-traumatise victim /survivors ofcrime but rather is an acknowledgment by the state that the victim/survivor has experienced an injury and in addition an acknowledgmentof such injury through financial award. In August,1993 the Magistrates' Court of Victoria in conjunctionwith the Project for Legal Action Against Sexual Assault, producedand promoted a pamphlet entitled "A Message to all VictorianWomen and Children who have been subject to Sexual Assault andother forms of Violence about Crimes Compensation in Victoria".This pamphlet was a concerted effort to inform and encourage sexualassault victims to apply for and receive Crimes Compensation.The first page of the booklet states "The Community has aresponsibility to protect women and children from male violence.Where it fails to do this, compensation is the only way to acknowledgethe pain, suffering and other expenses caused by the violence....... the Victorian community must take care of victims of crime". In December 1994 the Victorian Community Council Against Violencereleased its report for it's inquiry into services for victimsof crime, which it carried out for the Attorney General and theMinister for Police and Associated Services. In section 2 of itsreport entitled "The Voice of Victims" it found thatCrimes Compensation "was considered to be a very crucialcomponent of the Criminal Justice system's response to the victimsof crime". If a respondent to the survey was satisfied withthe Crimes Compensation Tribunal process it was generally on thebasis that the Tribunal member was attentive, caring, a good listenerand helped the victim to cope. If there was dissatisfaction withthe process it was generally on the basis of opposite reasons,namely the process was too short or the Tribunal member didn'tseem to care about the victim or could not relate to them. In this position Paper we will highlight a number of concernswhich serve to contradict the premise that the CCT is fulfillingits 'responsibility to protect women and children from male violence'or to provide a 'compassionate forum' to the victim/ survivorsof crime. Some of the major concerns discussed in this paper areas follows: 1. Attitudes expressed by Tribunal Members during cases. 2. Recent Practice Directions which serve, in numerous instancesto further traumatize victim/ survivors of crime, with for instance,the notification of alleged offenders, the pathologising of procedures,and a movement away from an informal environment to a more rigidadherence to the rules and procedures of a court which can bedaunting for victim/survivors particularly, as they will be confrontinga more adversarial context. 3. An increasing tendency of victim/survivors to withdraw or avoidmaking applications. 4. The conduct of the proceedings. 5. The use of uncorroborated, often highly prejudicial policebriefs. 6. The increasing use of the 'public purse' argument which oftenserve to denigrate the validity of the victim / survivor's harm. 7. The issue of funding. Since researching this paper more areas of concern have arisen.These will be raised under the heading "Other Areas of Concern"at the end of this paper. PREPARATION OF THIS PAPER The Federation of Community Centres and the Violence Against Womenand Children Working Group became aware of some startling experiencesof victim / survivors in the CCT and decided to make further enquiriesas a consequence. This concern was raised in a letter to the Editorof 'The Age' on the 8th June 1995 . The Attorney General respondedin a letter of 13th June 1995 stating that we should corresponddirectly with her as she had not been informed of any problems.To establish the extent of these problems a questionnaire wasprepared by the Federation of Community Legal Centres and sentto a number of people who work directly in the CCT field. Overthe past three months the Federation of Community Legal Centresand the Violence Against Women and Children Working Group havebeen liasing with a number of private practitioners who work atthe CCT, with CASAS, Refuges, the DVIRC, and VicSpan. These organisationshave been providing feedback on client experiences before theCCT. The Federation has also received feedback from many of itsown caseworkers in the CCT field that underline that there areserious problems. This paper will refer to only some of the manycases. BACKGROUND The voices of women who have been raped or assaulted in theirhome have been heard in increasing numbers in recent years. Thepassage of the Crimes (Sexual Offenses) Act 1991, the Crimes (Rape)Act 1991, the insertion of Section 21A of the Crimes Act whichcreated the crime of stalking, amendments to the Crimes (Family)Violence Act, the adoption by the Victoria Police of a Code ofPractice for Sexual Assault and Operating Procedures in relationto Family Violence, and the introduction of victim impact statementshave all contributed to a climate of support for victims of crime. The Attorney-General Jan Wade in introducing Victim Impact Statementssaid in June 1994 "As a community we have a responsibility to respond to theneeds and concerns of victims of crime. Many victims have voicedconcern that the effect of crime on their lives has not been acknowledgedby the courts. They have expressed dissatisfaction with the waythey have been treated by the criminal justice system. The Governmentrecongnises that victims of crime have sometimes been neglectedin the criminal justice system......" The criminal injuries compensation scheme has been embraced bymany victims and survivors of family violence and sexual assaultas an opportunity, to inform the community about their experienceand gain acknowledgment that their lives have been significantlyeffected as a result of a criminal act. For some victim/survivorsthe affirmation by the Tribunal of their experience has been oftherapeutic benefit. In addition the moneys obtained by them haveenabled women: - to obtain counseling and other therapeutic or medical treatment, - move to a new area and re-establish herself, - install security alarms, security doors or other safety measures The amount received by way of pain and suffering has providedwomen with a token or solatium of the community's concern. Thelevel of compensation has always been modest and never intendedto truly "compensate" the victim for their suffering. Women who have been sexually abused or victims/survivors of violencein the home have in recent years been encouraged to turn to thisjurisdiction and had been doing so in increasing numbers. Somepublications included comments like: : "A message to all Victorian Women and Children who have beensubject to sexual assault and other forms of Violence. About CrimesCompensation in Victoria", written and prepared by Projectfor Legal Action Against Sexual Assault and the Magistrates Courtof Victoria. This was launched in 1994 by Chief Magistrate Mr.Nick Pappas with Mrs. Jan Wade endorsing it; and "Crimes Compensation for Survivors of Violence in the Home",published by Coburg Brunswick Community Legal and Financial CounselingCentre, and launched by and applauded by the Attorney GeneralJan Wade and Jelena Popovic. This jurisdiction however, is set to fail victim/ survivors ofsexual assault and family violence unless the legislation is changedand many of the practices of the Tribunal urgently addressed.Any progress that has been made by the legal system to respondto the concerns of victims will otherwise be eroded. Of particularconcern are: 1. The Tribunal's move to the Magistrates' Court; 2. Narrow and restrictive interpretations of the legislation inconsistentwith the spirit of the Act; 3. Undue emphasis on the medicalisation of the impact of sexualabuse and violence in the home on women and children that demonstratea lack of understanding of such issues and 4. Increased use of section 7(7) and section 13 of the Act pursuantto a recent Practice direction issued by the Chief Magistrate,involving the calling of alleged offenders and the creating ofan adversarial forum. RECOMMENDATION: THAT PRACTICES OF THE CCT NEED TO BE URGENTLY ADDRESSED SOTHAT THEY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF VICTIM/SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. Allegations of violence in the home and sexual assault where theoffender is known to the victim/survivor are not easily made.Victims/survivors who do proceed with public disclosure of theabuse face: 1. Fear of retribution by the offender or his family or friends 2. Disbelief by family, friends, police, juries and the community 3. Associations of guilt, e.g. she should never have gone backto him; she lead him on; 4. Shame - feelings of shame for self and other family members. 5. Loss of family and friends because of division of support betweenthe victim and the offender 6. Displacement because of all of the above and the need to moveaway 7. Further trauma through her involvement as a "witness"in the criminal justice system. People who work with women who are victims and survivors of violencesee first hand the further victimisation these individuals facein the criminal justice system, the Family Court system and thecivil jurisdiction. In the criminal justice system the benefitof doubt lies with the accused and strict rules of evidence sometimesprevent juries from hearing the full story. In the Family Court,in relation to access and custody, the welfare of children isthe paramount concern. Where allegations of violence are madethe court only has to consider these allegations and make findingsin relation to them where the "best interests of the children"require that this be done. Issues of violence and fault are notrelevant to property and divorce proceedings In the civil jurisdictionlimitation periods, costs and unenforceable judgments mitigateagainst victims taking such action. Violence against women is a crime and a violation of a woman'sfundamental human right. The crimes compensation scheme is anopportunity for the community to redress the disadvantage womenwho are victims/survivors of criminal acts currently face withinthe legal system. As a Tribunal interpreting and implementingremedial legislation, it is our view that the scheme should beadministered in a way that promotes justice for victims. The spiritof the legislation requires that in this jurisdiction the interestsof victims/survivors be put ahead of any need to protect the perceivedrights or interests of alleged offenders. 2. RECOMMENDATION: THAT CCT BE ADMINISTERED IN A WAY WHICH PROMOTES JUSTICE FORVICTIM/SURVIVORS. Many women that we see at Community Legal Centres choose not topursue a legal course of action. Reasons for this include fearof retribution, guilt, shame, disruption and division caused tofamilies. The recent practice directions issued by the Tribunalin relation to the notification of offenders pursuant to section7 of the Act and the consequent opportunity of the alleged offenderto attend the hearing of the application , cross-examine witnessesand have access to documents filed by the applicant includingmedical reports, will again "silence" victims and survivorsof sexual assault and violence in the home. 21 year old Marie (not her real name) made an application forcompensation for the multiple counts of rape she suffered as achild by her older brother. Marie had disclosed the abuse to herparents as a young child. The brother was banished from the familyand she was told not to tell anyone. Marie's brother returnedhome several years later and she found it difficult to cope withthe distress and anxiety his presence caused. Marie secretly soughthelp from counselors at the Centre Against Sexual Assault. Mariehas continued with counseling and has made an application forcompensation. She is unable to tell her parents about the counselingor her application. She is now unable to proceed with the chargesagainst her brother. She could not cope with the responsibilityof again dividing her family, making her brother homeless andvulnerable and disclosing the "family secret" and sobringing shame to the family. Marie will not proceed with herapplication for compensation if the Tribunal elect to notify herbrother or her parents of the application. The Practice Directions reflect a regressive return to an outdatedbelief that a woman's uncorroborated allegation of assault shouldbe treated with extreme caution. Justice Deane of the High Courtin 1989 acknowledged that charges of sexual offenses are not "easilymade" - the humiliation and embarrassment that so wronglyfalls upon victims and survivors is so extreme as to militateagainst the making of many complaints. He added that such complaintswere however "not hard to defend". (The Voice of theRapist, J. Scutt, page 38). Indeed research conducted by the VictorianLaw Reform Commission showed that in 1988-89 less than half ofthose offenders charged were convicted of a rape offense. In athird of cases, offenders were convicted of some lesser offense.Thirty-four percent of people committed for trial by jury forrape were not convicted of any offense. In addition, VictoriaPolice statistics show that charges are laid against an offenderin approximately one third of incidents where a rape has beenreported. (page 5 Rape Law Reform Evaluation Project: Report No1) RECENT PRACTICE DIRECTIONS The Practice Direction issued by Nicholas Pappas, Chief Magistrate,4th May 1995, provides as follows: 1. In certain circumstances the Tribunal may consider it appropriateto give notification to "any person who, in the opinion ofthe Tribunal has or may have an interest in the determinationof the application". 2. The Tribunal will generally give notice only in the followingcircumstances:- (i) The identity of the alleged offender is known or can be established;and/or (ii) No Police charges have been laid either at the insistenceof the Applicant or because of a decision by the police or DPPnot to do so; (iii) The Applicant's claim, on a reading of the file materialis not strong and another version of events unfavorable to theApplicant is reasonably open; and/or (iv) As a matter of fairness the alleged offender should be notifiedof the application (see Smith's case A.A.T. 93/3780) 3. Where a Tribunal Member determines that notification shouldbe given to the alleged offender of the allegations made againsthim/her, the following procedure will apply: (i) The Tribunal will write to the Applicant or Applicant's solicitorif there is a solicitor on the record advising of the decisionto notify the alleged offender pursuant to s7(7). (ii) Fourteen days later the Tribunal will then forward by certifiedmail a brief letter to the alleged offender setting out the natureof the allegations and asking the alleged offender to advise within14 days of the date of the letter whether he/she wishes to be:- * advised of the hearing date of the application so that he/shemay attend the hearing and * represented by Counsel at the hearing (iii) An alleged offender has 14 days from the date of the certifiedletter to reply. If no reply is received the matter is set downfor hearing. The Applicant is notified of the failure of the allegedoffender to respond to the Tribunal's notice of the allegationsmade against him/her (iv) If a reply is received the Applicant is notified of the allegedoffender's intention to appear. The Applicant is then requestedto advise the number and type of the witnesses the applicant maycall and give an estimate of hearing time and advise if the Applicantwishes to use the Remote Witness facility at the Tribunal Court. (v) The Registrar of the Tribunal will arrange for a ProtectiveSecurity officer to be present at the hearing in appropriate circumstances. 4. It is anticipated that Notice pursuant to s. 7(7) of the Actwill be given only to a limited number and class of persons. Generallythere should be sufficient material on the Tribunal file for aTribunal Member to make a determination on the material withoutinvolving any hearing as to whether or not on the balance of probabilitiesa crime punishable by a term of imprisonment has been committedagainst the Applicant. 5. If an alleged offender elects to attend the hearing of theapplication the Tribunal will:- * notify the alleged offender of the date and place of the hearing;and * make available to the alleged offender a copy of the applicationtogether with a copy of any statement made by the applicant settingout the allegations made against the alleged offender. An alleged offender or his/her legal representative will havethe right to peruse any police file in the possession of the Tribunalas does the Applicant but will not be permitted to make photocopiesof any of the material contained in the police brief. The principlesof legal/medical privilege applicable in the civil law apply toall material contained in the Tribunal's file. 6. The Tribunal will in accordance with S. 13(1)(a) of the CriminalInjuries Compensation Act 1983 hear and determine the applicationexpeditiously and informally and "having regard to the requirementsof justice and without regard to legal forms and solemnities,and may act without observing legal rules relating to evidenceand procedure" THE DECISION TO NOTIFY AN ALLEGED OFFENDER There is uncertainty and inconsistency between Tribunals as towhen and if the Practice Directions will be followed. Some Tribunalsare using the Tribunal's power to subpoena the alleged offenderrather than notifying the alleged offender pursuant to section7(7). A trend toward notification is occurring in almost all casesof family violence where the matter has not proceeded to chargesbeing laid and all cases of sexual assault where the alleged offenderis known to the Applicant. It was the case of Smith that prompted the Crimes CompensationTribunal to issue this Practice Direction. The facts of Smithhowever ,should be carefully considered whenever it is being usedas a precedent for notification. In this case the Applicant wasa very young child. Evidence of the alleged abuse therefore camefrom third parties. In addition, there had been a very long andacrimonious dispute between the child's parents in relation toaccess and the abuse had been denied by the father. This shouldbe distinguished from applications made by adults who can givepersonal accounts of the crime and subsequent trauma. Given the nature of an application for compensation and particularlya claim for compensation arising out of an incident where theoffender is known to the victim, any decision to notify an allegedoffender or any other person of the application must be exercisedwith extreme caution. (see Smith v CCT, No. 93/13780, page 5) 3. RECOMMENDATION: A DECISION TO NOTIFY AN ALLEGED OFFENDER SHOULD BE USED RARELY AND SHOULD ONLY OCCUR IN EXCEPTIONAL OR EXTREMECIRCUMSTANCES.. In his Practice Directions, the Chief Magistrate states: "it is anticipated that Notice pursuant to s.7(7) of theAct will be given only to a limited number and class of persons.Generally there should be sufficient material on the Tribunalfile for a Tribunal Member to make a determination on the materialwithout involving any hearing as to whether or not on the balanceof probabilities a crime punishable by a term of imprisonmenthas been committed against the Applicant" Despite the caution expressed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunaland the Chief Magistrate, it is becoming clear that in almostall cases of assault in the home or sexual assault where the offenderis known to the applicant and where charges have not been laid,the alleged offender is being notified. A.. applied for compensation for injuries suffered by her whenshe was physically assaulted by her husband . A alleged that shewas punched in the chest, thrown to the floor, strangled and shakenby the offender. The alleged offender panicked and rang the policeafter the applicant "blacked out" The offender accompaniedthe applicant to the hospital where injuries consistent with theher version of the assault were observed and recorded. The policeattended the hospital and it was recorded by the attending policeofficers on the Patrol Duty Record that the offender admittedto police that he assaulted the applicant. The applicant madea written statement in which she said that she did not want anyfurther action taken against her husband. In her application tothe Tribunal the applicant alleged that the alleged offender hadthreatened to kill her if she had charges laid against him. Thepolice did not take a statement from the offender or lay any charges.The applicant left the matrimonial home that evening and the partieshave remained separated. Although not notified pursuant to section7(7) the alleged offender was subpoenaed to attend the hearing. The above case illustrates that since the issue of the PracticeDirection, the Tribunal appears to be reluctant to determine applicationswithout having first notified the offender of the allegationsagainst him and giving him an opportunity to be heard. Section21 of the Act expressly allows the Tribunal to make an Award whetheror not a person is prosecuted for or convicted of an offense.Prior to the issue of these practice directions, notificationof the offender and/or his involvement in the hearing rarely occurred.The Tribunal have heard and determined many applications by victimswhere crimes had not been reported, charges had not been laidor convictions had not been achieved. The Tribunal also appear to have little or no sensitivity or understandingof the physical or psychological danger that victims are put underor perceive themselves to be in when a decision is made to notifyan alleged offender. The decision can subject the victim/survivorsto physical danger and cause considerable fear, stress and anxietyto the applicant. Many applicants have been threatened by theoffender with retribution or an escalation of violence if thevictim\survivor reports the assault. Whilst protections such asremote witness facilities and security guards are offered at theTribunal on the hearing day no protection or security is offeredto victims/survivors between the date of notification or subpoenaand the hearing or indeed following the proceedings. 4. RECOMMENDATION: THAT THE TRIBUNAL BE CONSCIOUS OF THE THREAT THATNOTIFICATION OF AN OFFENDER HAS ON THE SECURITY OF VICTIM/ SURVIVORS. Current applicants and potential applicants are unable to be clearlyadvised whether or not notification will occur. The risk thattheir application will not be confidential is of particular concernto Victims/survivors of sexual assault and family violence. Therisk of this occurring has already resulted in a number of applicantsindicating to their solicitors and counselors that they are notproceeding with their claims and other potential applicants electingnot to pursue claims. Those who choose to pursue their claimsare reporting increased anxiety and distress at the knowledgethat the alleged offender has or may be notified. Jane who was assaulted by her former husband, chose to proceedwith her application despite the Tribunal's advice that the offenderwas to be notified. She said to her solicitor, " since youtold me he was to be made aware of the hearing I haven't leftthe house alone. My son is only allowed to play out the back andI watch him constantly." Mary was raped. On being told by her lawyer that the alleged offenderhad been notified Mary instructed her solicitor to withdraw herapplication as she was afraid. 5. RECOMMENDATION: THE PRACTICE OF NOTIFYING ALLLEGED OFFENDERS BECURTAILED IN LIGHT OF RECENT WTHDRAWALS OF APPLICATIONS BY APPLICANTS. OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO DECISION TO NOTIFY In our view, at the very least, the Applicant should be givenan opportunity to address the Tribunal about its decision to notifythe alleged offender prior to the notification occurring. Currentlyno such procedure is available although we know of one case wherethe Applicant did get such an opportunity and the Tribunal electednot to notify the alleged offender. F. applied for compensation for the injuries she suffered duringher marriage to D. She alleged that D. had physically assaultedher, unlawfully imprisoned her and threatened to kill her. F.had not reported the assaults to the police during the marriageor since. F. had not seen a doctor at the time of the assaultsand so had no evidence of the physical injuries. F. feared thatD. would kill her if she reported the crimes to the police, adoctor or anyone else. At the hearing the Tribunal member challengedF. about the incidents, challenged F. about her injury and challengedher about her fear of reporting the crime to the police. F. wasa good historian and described her ordeal in detail. The Tribunalmember asked F. what was the worst thing that had happened duringthe marriage. F. described in detail the time D. made her sitat the kitchen table as he loaded his gun. She described how shefroze in terror as D. placed the gun in her mouth and demonstratedto her how easy it was for him to kill her. The Tribunal Memberwithout hesitation accepted the truth of F's account. In this case he Tribunal were initially hesitant about grantingan Award to F. but after hearing evidence from her an Award wasmade. Similarly, a Tribunal may consider it unnecessary and undesirableto notify an alleged offender of an application after hearingsuch evidence from the applicant. It would certainly be the saferand more protective option to allow the applicant to explain atthe outset why the alleged offender should not be notified wherethe tribunal proposes such action. 6. RECOMMENDATION: THAT WHERE AN ALLEGED OFFENDER IS TO BE NOTIFIED,IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE APPLICANT BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITYTO ADDRESS THE TRIBUNAL ABOUT ITS DECISION PRIOR TO SUCH NOTIFICATION. OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND HEARING - SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST The letter sent to offenders pursuant to the Practice Directionin our view quite improperly invites the offender to indicatewhether or not the offender wishes to appear at the hearing andbe represented. The assumption is made by the Tribunal that theAlleged offender has a "substantial interest" in theapplication. The Act provides that the alleged offender is onlyentitled to appear at the hearing and be represented if he isdetermined to have a "substantial interest" in the proceedings(Section 11(1)). The Tribunal in our submission should not forman opinion as to whether or not the alleged offender has a substantialinterest in the proceedings unless and until it hears submissionsfrom the alleged offender. This should be determined as a preliminaryissue prior to the hearing and the Applicant given an opportunityto put forward submissions against the alleged offender's involvementin the hearing process. The fact alone that he is the allegedoffender should not in itself be sufficient to determine thathe has a substantial interest. We state this in the context ofthe difficulties detailed earlier in this paper i.e the possibleexposure to dangers and trauma victim/survivors are exposed to.If it was intended that being an offender alone gave them a "substantialinterest" then all alleged offenders would always be entitledto attend the hearing and section 11 would say that explicitly.The decision reached on this preliminary issue should be reviewable.Currently decisions in relation to interlocutory steps are notreviewable. 7. RECOMMENDATION: THE TRIBUNAL SHOULD NOT FORM AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER AN ALLEGED OFFENDER HAS A SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS UNTIL IT HEARS SUBMISSIONS FROM THE ALLEGED OFFENDER AS A PRELIMINARY ISSUE PRIOR TO HEARING AND THE APPLICANT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT FORWARD SUBMISSIONS AGAINST THE ALLEGED OFFENDERS INVOLVEMENT PRIOR TO HEARING.THE DECISION REACHED ON THIS PRELIMINARY ISSUE SHOULD BE REVIEWABLE. CURRENTLY DECISIONS IN RELATION TO INTERLOCUTORY STEPS ARE NOT REVIEWABLE. It is our view that an alleged offender could rarely be regardedas having an "interest" or "substantial interest"in the proceedings so as to entitle them to be notified pursuantto section 7 and/or be entitled to appear at the hearing pursuantto section 11(1). An alleged offender does not suffer any lossof liberty or property as a result of the determination of theTribunal, no order is made against him/her and he/she is not aparty to the action (unless he has also been convicted of a criminalact, in which case the conviction is conclusive evidence thatthe crime occurred). Similarly his rights or the rights of hischild or children to apply for or exercise access with him arenot effected per se by the Tribunal's findings. Any evidence beforethe Tribunal is not admissible in any other proceedings. The FamilyCourt which has an entirely different focus will, makes its owndecision about the welfare of the children based on the evidencebefore it. The "right" of the alleged offender to defend his namehas also been suggested as justification for this practice. TheTribunal have the power to prohibit the reporting of any applicationor decision. In addition it is our experience that victims andsurvivors of sexual assault and family violence do not use decisionsto publicly humiliate offenders. The alleged offender always couldhave recourse to civil proceedings for defamation if his reputationwas unjustifiably affected. Terri obtained compensation in the crimes compensation tribunalfor the abuse she had suffered as a child from her step-father.Terri had been raped. He pleaded guilty in the Court to havingindecently assaulted her and was placed on a good behavior bondso the real story was never told. Her mother and brothers forgavehim and couldn't understand why she could not. Apart from herfamily no one else in the small country town even knew about thecriminal charges. . Relatives and family friends wondered whyshe didn't come home for holidays anymore and she was brandeda snob. Terri was hurt and angry and she made a lengthy statementto the Tribunal but she didn't tell the town or family friendsand relatives because she knew it would hurt her mother and brothersmore than him. At a forum on crimes compensation held 19th September 1995, SupervisingMagistrate, Ms. Ann McDonald indicated that since the PracticeDirection was issued approximately 50 notifications had been made.She further stated that in only a few cases had the alleged offendersresponded to such notifications and in only a couple of caseshad the alleged offender chosen to attend the hearing. These figuresdemonstrate an overwhelming lack of "interest" on thepart of alleged offenders to participate in this forum. The Tribunalhave the power to prohibit the reporting of any application ordecision. The Practice of notification has in our view no justificationwhatsoever but is having the effect of discouraging applicantsfrom proceeding, dissuading potential applicants from applyingand for those who proceed, adding further trauma to their experience. 8. RECOMMENDATION: THE TRIBUNAL HAVE THE POWER TO PROHIBIT THE REPORTING OF ANY APPLICATION OR DECISION. THE PRACTICE OF NOTIFICATION HAS NO JUSTIFICATION WHATSOEVER BUT IS HAVING THE EFFECT OF DISCOURAGING APPLICANTS FORM PROCEEDING, DISSUADING POTENTIAL APPLICANTS FROM APPLYING AND FOR THOSE WHO PROCEED, ADDING FURTHER TRAUMA TO THEIR EXPERIENCE. OPPORTUNITY OF ALLEGED OFFENDER TO PERUSE THE DOCUMENTS FILED BY THE APPLICANT Paragraph 5 of the Practice Directions provide: 5. If an alleged offender elects to attend the hearing of theapplication the Tribunal will:- * notify the alleged offender of the date and place of the hearing;and * make available to the alleged offender a copy of the applicationtogether with a copy of any statement made by the applicant settingout the allegations made against the alleged offender. An alleged offender or his/her legal representative will havethe right to peruse any police file in the possession of the Tribunalas does the Applicant but will not be permitted to make photocopiesof any of the material contained in the police brief. The principlesof legal/medical privilege applicable in the civil law apply toall material contained in the Tribunal's file. This direction will enable Respondents to peruse those medicalreports filed by the Applicant and which she intends to rely uponin her case. These reports often contain detailed informationabout the Applicant's physical and psychological medical history. It is our view that this Practice be immediately reviewed. Inour view an alleged offender should never be given any opportunityto challenge a victim or the victim's medical witnesses on theissue of "injury suffered". The Tribunal can and shoulddecide this issue on the balance of probabilities on the evidencebefore it. If there is insufficient evidence an Award can be refused.In our view little assistance can be provided by the Respondentin this regard but much harm will be done to victims/survivorsby allowing such access to reports and allowing victims/survivorsto be cross-examined on this issue. 9. RECOMMENDATION: IT IS OUR VIEW THAT THIS PRACTICE BE IMMEDIATELYREVIEWED. IN OUR VIEW AN ALLEGED OFFENDER SHOULD NEVER BE GIVENANY OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE A VICTIM OR THE VICTIM'S MEDICALWITNESSES ON THE ISSUE OF "INJURY SUFFERED". THE TRIBUNALCAN AND SHOULD DECIDE THIS ISSUE ON THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITIESON THE EVIDENCE BEFORE IT. The Tribunal needs to be wary as access to these reports couldbe used by the alleged offender in any subsequent prosecution.Further issues arise as to when the alleged offender should obtainsuch access. If early access is available an alleged offendermay use the crimes compensation procedures to obtain this informationfor their own interest and use. Once the material is obtainedthe alleged offender may choose not to attend the hearing at all.This practice is operating retrospectively. In filing medicalreports and other material, applicants to date have done so withoutconsidering the consequences to them of the alleged offender havingaccess to them. Such applicants should be given an opportunityto withdraw materials previously filed. 9. RECOMMENDATION: IN FILING MEDICAL REPORTS AND OTHER MATERIAL, APPLICANTS TODATE HAVE DONE SO WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE CONSEQUENCES TO THEMOF THE ALLEGED OFFENDER HAVING ACCESS TO THEM. SUCH APPLICANTSSHOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO WITHDRAW MATERIALS PREVIOUSLYFILED. CONDUCT OF THE HEARING The involvement of alleged offenders in the hearing process isextremely problematic. Section 13(1) provides that where the Tribunal decides to conducta hearing of an application "it shall hear and determine the application expeditiouslyand subject to section 12(1)(b), informally, having regard tothe requirements of justice and without regard to legal formsand solemnities and may act without observing legal rules relatingto evidence or procedure..." The alleged offender's has of course the right to refuse to giveevidence on the grounds of self-incrimination. If he chooses notto give evidence, then in the interests of Natural Justice tothe Applicant, he should be further excluded from the hearingand his refusal be seen as demonstrating a lack of interest. Hispresence at the hearing would thereafter be of little assistanceto the Tribunal in determining whether or not a criminal act orwhether or not an injury occurred. Another of our concerns is the role played by the Tribunal itselfin the hearing process when an alleged offender attends whetherrepresented or otherwise. George was subpoenaed to attend a recent crimes compensation tribunalhearing. He attended unrepresented and agreed to give evidence.The Tribunal took George through his version of the events ina manner not unlike examination in chief. The Tribunal did notat any time take the opportunity to challenge George about hisversion of the events. George did not deny the assault but attemptedto minimise the violence that had occurred. George's version wasinconsistent with the Applicant's version and the medical evidence.George was cross-examined by the Applicant's legal representative. Whilst this procedure may not be objectionable, it is in sharpcontrast to the role the Tribunal takes when the Applicant andher witnesses give evidence. The applicant Jenny in a sexual assault case, had made it clearshe had not proceeded to prosecute the alleged offender as shewas afraid of him. The applicant Jenny stated that she did notwant the shame of everyone knowing. Nevertheless, the Magistratestated that if she was not prepared to prosecute then Jenny shouldnot be compensated. Later the Magistrate changed her mind andmade an award. DEFINITION OF VICTIM AND INJURY There is an increasing trend in this jurisdiction to narrowlyinterpret the definition of "injury". This trend isevidenced by the Tribunal's increasing reliance on psychiatristsor clinical psychologists to determine the injury and their requirementof a diagnosis of a recognisable pathology or disorder. It is our view that the definition of "injury" shouldbe immediately reviewed so as to validate and acknowledge thenature and extent of the suffering of victims of violence in thehome and sexual assault. 10. RECOMMENDATION: THAT THE DEFINITION OF "INJURY" SHOULDBE IMMEDIATELY REVIEWED SO AS TO VALIDATE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THENATURE AND EXTENT OF THE SUFFERING OF VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE IN THEHOME AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. REGIONALISATION OF TRIBUNALS Originally, the Tribunal was located in an office in the cityand it then began operating from the Prahran Magistrate's Courtas well. When its sole location was transferred to Prahran, perforce all sexual assault cases were heard there, consequentlyallowing Tribunal members to build up expertise in this complexand difficult area. This practice was extended when all sexualassault cases were then transferred to the Central Registry atthe Melbourne Magistrates Court. However a recent practice Directionissued on the 4th of May this year has ceased this practice. Theapplication for the primary victim must be now lodged and heardat the Tribunal Court closest to where the primary victim resides.We are concerned that with the regionalisation of the Tribunal,the applications of victim/survivors of sexual assault will nolonger be dealt with by Magistrates who are aware of the sensitivityneeded and the complexity of the issues involved. The Chief Magistrate is concerned that &quot;constant exposureto the pain and suffering of severely traumatised victims of crimecan lead to either cynicism, "compassion fatigue" ora heightened sensitivity to the plight of the severely psychologicallydamaged applicants" and consequently is keen to insure thatthere is a "spread of this work to bring from time to timea fresh approach to this difficult area of work."1 Whilewe would not wish to see members of the Tribunal "burnt out"we are concerned that a "fresh approach" not be at therisk of comprising equitable treatment and outcomes for victim/survivorsof sexual assault. A cynical view would be that there is a callfor more hardened Magistrates as a means of having costs reducedrather than taking heed of a range of organisations includingThe Australian Law Reform Commission for greater sensitivity andgender awareness in sexual assault cases. Such Reports have clearly demonstrated that insensitivity of the judiciary and magistracy only serve to revictimise.2 Consequently, we would advocate stronglythat in the event of all sexual assault matters not being heardat a single location, that training be provided for all membersof the Tribunal so as to best equip them for dealing with sucha complex and sensitive area. 11. RECOMMENDATION: THAT IN THE EVENT OF ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT MATTERSNOT BEING HEARD AT A SINGLE LOCATION, THAT TRAINING BE PROVIDEDFOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE TRIBUNAL SO AS TO BEST EQUIP THEM FOR DEALINGWITH SUCH A COMPLEX AND SENSITIVE AREA. MAGISTRATES ATTITUDES Feedback from practitioners and the victim/survivors they actfor, indicates that some magistrates continue to display attitudeswhich are dismissive of the experiences of victim/survivors ofmale violence. Some magistrates fail to understand the well documenteddifficulties faced by victim survivors in seeking legal redressfor the crimes committed against them. In some cases it appearsthat they adhere to outdated notions that women lie about havingbeen sexually assaulted. This is despite the large amount of workwhich has gone into improving the gender awareness of the Magistracy. Victim/survivors have endured hostility from Magistrates who havedoubted their integrity in reporting to police, crimes of sexualassault committed against them in their teens. Some police havea belief that women report sexual offenses in order to get crimescompensation and are there for not genuine reasons. It would seemthat some Magistrates also hold to this view. One Magistrate eventook it upon himself to comment that a rape committed by a boyon his sister was a demonstration of a natural curiosity and youthfulexhuberance, and reduced her award accordingly. There have been several reports where Magistrates have, withoutquestion, accepted gratuitous comments by police in their reports.Centres Against Sexual Assault report that where victim/survivorsare reluctant to go ahead with criminal charges because of theinherent trauma and re-victimisation this often brings about,police in turn, are writing in their reports that they do notbelieve the victim/survivors. Magistrates are in turn taking onthis belief as reality and questioning the bona fides of applications.The impact of this attitude has and will continue to discouragevictim/survivors from applying for compensation. Some Magistrates are making conscious inferences that applicantscan be believed or not believed according to whether the allegedoffender attends the hearing. Hence in one case the alleged offenderdidn't appear so the Magistrate decided on that basis that theapplication was genuine. If Magistrates infer the genuinenessof applications based on assumptions about alleged offenders decisionsto not attend, they could feasibly infer that a crime had notoccurred on the basis that an alleged offender choosing to attend.This type of discretion was not the intention of the legislationwhich is supposed to be remedial and in favor of the applicant. One outraged victim/survivor reports that she felt that the presidingmagistrate had made up her mind that no crime had taken placebefore hearing and without hearing all relevant evidence, A I was questioned ( not in the witness box) as a token gestureand not with the thoroughness warranted by the situation..) ...Whenever I spoke, (the magistrate) cut me short and I feel thatI did not have free speech or a genuine hearing. Later the magistratesuggested the victim/survivor had played the A fragile flowerin order to manipulate the support of a particular detective. Insensitive comments such as A you're smiling ,so you're obviouslyno longer distressed reflect prejudices about what is an appropriatedemeanor for a real/deserving (sic) victim, and fail to demonstrateany awareness that some people smile as a nervous reaction toa situation they are in, such as being in a court room. Magistrates have placed considerable emphasis on the fact thatawards of compensation come from the public purse, implying thatthey should be kept to a minimum, making applicants feel theyare being weighed in the scales of justice. The message this givesto victim/survivors is that they are not deserving of compensation,and flies in the face of the rationale for the Criminal InjuriesAct. This will often further traumatize the victim /survivor bytrivialising their experience on the grounds of the "publicpurse". One woman was told by a magistrate that A you cant just frontup here with a statement and five supporting statutory declarationsof and expect to get crimes compensation. The five statutory declarationsof witnesses accompanied a letter from the woman's refuge shestayed in, a letter from a police officer and a psychologistsreport. The co-ordinating Magistrate appears to have a suspicion of socialworkers. She told one applicant that many social workers pushwomen into going for crimes compensation and that she felt thatwomen go from a controlling husband to a controlling social worker.This is both an insult to the social work profession and the applicantfor Crimes Compensation. 12. RECOMMENDATION: THAT MAGISTRATES BE EDUCATED SO AS TO RAISE THEIR AWARENESS AND THEIR SENSITIVITY AS TO THE HARM AND DILEMMAS FACED BY VICTIM SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. USE OF POLICE STATEMENTS BY MAGISTRATES. The police report will often form part of the tribunal's file.Three areas are of concern. They are: 1. The contents of the police reports. 2. Their use by Magistrates. 3. Access to the file. The police briefs often contain comments about the applicant andthe circumstances surrounding the crime which are not backed upby evidence, trivialise the event, or are purely supposition orexpressions of personal opinion. They are thus highly prejudicial. Comments have been made by police in sexual assault cases like:- "It may have a lot to do with the fact that she hangs aroundwith the wrong groups of people' and 'she must have been an easywoman given where the incident happened" Such comments have little merit, particularly, as in this instancethe officer making the report had had no personal contact withthe applicant he was discussing. Other reports make similarly unwarranted conclusions without anyinvestigation occurring and rely again on no direct contact betweenthe officer making the report and the victim other than: " after discussions with hospital staff I..." The Rape Law Reform Evaluation Project No.1 on page 101quotesother police comments that are of concern. For example : "Just as a passing comment I would guess that 2/3rds of thealleged rapes which I have attended have been false reports". More care needs to be taken by police about the contents of theirreports. Many of the comments by police are often made in the context oftheir frustration with the victim's decision not to press chargesor the ingrained suspicion of officers who are accustomed to dealingwith suspects rather than victims. It is stated in the publication"Sexual Assault: Law Reform May 1995" by the Officeof The Status Of Women at page 47 that: 'Similarly, it is evident that some police continue to treat sexualassault victims with disbelief, especially where consent is themajor issue, and some victims have been actively discouraged fromproceeding with reports" Such decisions by victims not to proceed are often due to thepolice's disbelief that an assault occurred, a fear of reprisalby the alleged offender, a lack of confidence in the court system,a concern about being identified, or an uncertainty about whatsort of behavior is legally defined as rape. Police do not consistently keep records of attendance's at domesticviolence calls. This means where no charges have been laid itbecomes difficult for women to prove that police had attendedas in the case of one of the women who wrote to us. A I had notcharged my ex husband or even made a statement, the police didattend three times but my solicitor and the tribunal could findno record of police attendance, although one of the police officerscould remember attending and sent a brief letter stating such. The Rape Law Reform Evaluation Project No.1 at page 100 notesthat directives in the Detective Training School notes( currentin 1993) and still the basis of CIB training states that officers "must remember at all times that complaints in sexual assaultcases are easily made. False allegations resulting in sexual neuroses,fantasy, jealousy, spite or simply a girl's refusal to admit..." The personal opinions in police reports are therefore not surprisinggiven their police training. In Victoria in1991 the Law ReformCommission in association with the Victorian Community CouncilAgainst Violence examined a sample of official police crime reportsto gather information about reasons given for not proceeding withcases. The main reasons given in the crime reports were that therewas insufficient evidence or that the police felt the woman wasnot being truthful or made a false report. This is referred toin "Sexual Assault: Law Reform May 1995" by the Officeof The Status Of Women at page 47. Having established the concern over what is written in policereports the next issue is the weight that some magistrates attachto them. Some magistrates have stated that they will rely on policereports in the absence of an applicant. Some Magistrates willdefer to and give weight to these often unsubstantiated reportsrather than the victim's version because of the 'expertise' ofpolice - police who are not psychologists or counseling expertsbut who will conclude that because of a victim's 'calm demeanor'that she is 'unaffected'. A calm demeanor can relate to shockor exhaustion of the applicant and a further examination by qualifiedexperts would have revealed this. This reliance on police reportsby magistrates places a heavy burden on the applicant's solicitorand may serve to compound further the trauma of the applicantwhich was the initial reason for the application. There are still reports of the applicants or their solicitorsbeing refused access to the police file despite the new practicedirections and the protocols in place that notify police thatthe material may be released. We have heard of instances in theHeidelberg, Ballarat and Geelong Tribunals where applicant's solicitorshave been denied access. Clearly the Practice Directions are notbeing applied uniformly. Given the prejudicial nature of the reportsit is vital for the applicant's case that they know, in advance,what the often spurious conclusions by police are so they canrebut them so as to avoid the risk of such reports coloring themagistrate's determination. In one instance, an alleged offender had all the tribunal's documentsincluding personal medical records in support of her claim andthe police reports under FOI. The applicant however, did not havethe same access to her own file. Does this enable the allegedoffender the opportunity to cross-examine the applicant? (it isa reality that often an alleged offender will be represented whereasan applicant will not be represented) Does the applicant havea similar right to cross examine the alleged offender? Isn't thismoving away towards an adversarial setting which tribunals weresupposed to avoid? What the implications of access of the allegedoffender to these medical records will be for the applicants inlater court actions can only be feared, particularly, as a mentaldisorder must be proven for an applicant to establish a non- physicalclaim. In an adversarial court setting the 'disorder'( neededto be proven to establish a claim before a tribunal) may discreditthe applicant's story when he/she is cross examined by an aggressivedefense barrister as 'unstable'. In summary, the police need to be more responsible and cautiousin the contents of their reports and the Magistracy need to activelydisregard unsubstantiated, unsworn the police commentary. 13. RECOMMENDATION: THAT THE POLICE NEED TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE ANDCAUTIOUS IN THE CONTENTS OF THEIR REPORTS AND THE MAGISTRACY NEEDTO ACTIVELY DISREGARD UNSUBSTANTIATED, UNSWORN THE POLICE COMMENTARY. THE PUBLIC PURSE Unlike other forms of community compensation, Crimes Compensationis not funded by any insurance levies such as those which applyfor worker's compensation or transport accident compensation.Crimes compensation is paid directly from the consolidated fund.There are many anecdotal stories regarding the attitudes of Magistrateswhen hearing Crimes Compensation Applications as they see themselvesas protectors of the public purse. It is an attitude which firstenables the Magistrate to first justify the low level of theiraward, and secondly to make the victim feel undeserving, almostto the point of their being an opportunity in applying to theCrimes Compensation Tribunal. It is an attitude that is not uncommonin other areas of compensation, but without the contribution ofinsurance levies there is less room for the attitude of just deserts. In representing the public purse, Tribunals take on an adversarialposition against the Applicant. If Tribunals intend to conducthearings using this adversarial method the Tribunal should alwaysbe assisted by counsel so that they can listen to the evidencewithout distraction and without any confusion as to their role. The current shift to crimes compensation needs to be seen in lightof an obvious, although camouflaged aim of reducing the cost ofthe Crimes Compensation Tribunal by making it more restrictiveand aiming to discourage categories of victims from applying forcompensation. Unfortunately the victims are , in our submission,most deserving of compensation, namely women and children whoare the victims of violence and sexual assault. It is not thepolice officers who not only make up the largest claimants whoare in paid employment but also have the added compensation avenueof worker's compensation, who will be deterred from making claimsunder the new directions. In official statistics men are reflected in claims for crimescompensation however, women and children who are often intimidatedor ashamed to report violence or sexual assault remain as thehidden statistics. If the Crimes Compensation Tribunal continuesto conduct itself in the manner outlined in this position paperthen it will mean that it will become even more difficult forthe vulnerable express their plight and receive some form of acknowledgmentfrom the State of the harm they have suffered. 14. RECOMMENDATION: THAT THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT INCLUDE A CRIMES COMPENSATIONFUND IN THE GUIDELINES FOR THE ALLOCATION OF THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTFUND. WHERE SHOULD THE MONEY COME FROM? It is the view of the VAWAC that there is a significant pool ofmoney in the community support fund raised from gambling revenueat the Casino. This fund is said to receive $1m per week. (SundayAge 25th June 1995 p23) After funds have been allocated to Arts, Tourism, Community Services,Sport, Recreation and research on Gambling, there should stillbe enough for other purposes which are of benefit to the community.This could feasibly include a fund for Crimes Compensation. Further reasons why the gambling money could fund Crimes Compensationare that some crime will be committed as a result of gamblingaddiction, there will always be an enormous pool of money in thisfund, it is not directly derived from individual offenders inthe courts most of whom would not have means to pay, and the communityhas a moral obligation to compensate victims of crime 15. RECOMMENDATION: THAT MONEY TO PAY COMPENSATION BE DEDUCTED FROMTHE COMMUNITY SUPPORT FUND RATHER THAN ALLOW CUTBACKS IN AWARDSWHICH SERVE TO RECOGNISE AND REHABILITATE VICTIM/SURVIVORS OFSEXUAL ASSAULT. SUMMARY The current procedures , attitudes of magistrates, use of policereports, and cost cutting arguments are undermining the very supportiverole the Tribunal should be exercising in its deliberations involvingvictim/survivors of crime. The issues and problems highlightedin this paper need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. OTHER ISSUES OF CONCERN Since the preparation of this paper other areas of concern havecome to our attention. In an effort to have this paper publishedas soon as possible we will list other areas of concern whichare also in need of community focus and discussion. They are: 1. The reported refusal of some Tribunal members to pay for CASAreports. 2. The refusal of Tribunal members to accept reports of experiencedand qualified people and therefore the further pathologising ofthe Tribunals evidentiary basis. 1.

That the police department budget is not increased in the August1992/1993 state budget. Recommendation 2. That Victoria Police numbers be reduced by 20% over the next fiveyears and that Victorian Government resources released throughthese reductions be applied to community based crime preventionprograms. Recommendation 3. That a significant shift in police budget priorities take placeto reflect community concerns about violent crime. In particularthere should be an increase in the budget line expenditure forOperation Support Services (which is currently only 1.38% of thetotal police budget), which covers family violence, to take effectimmediately. That the current expenditure of 1 million on the police mediaunit be substantially scaled down and monies be allocated to appropriatesupport services. Recommendation 4. That an external structure such as a Statutory Body be used tomonitor and review police effectiveness in terms of policing practicesand priorities. The Federation believes the Law Reform Commission with its resources and skills in research and evaluation is best placed to carryout this function if adequately funded. Recommendation 5. That the annual budget review of police department expenditureconsider police time and effectiveness according to prioritiesset within a crime prevention framework. Recommendation 6. That police Accountability be seriously addressed through an effectiveexternal Complaints Authority. The current system lacks communityconfidence and is not effective. Recommendation 7. That external accountability structures, including an independentCommunity Visitors Scheme and local non-police management andadvisory committees be established to oversee police operationsat local community level. Recommendation 8. That a Royal Commission of Inquiry be held into all operations,management and accountability of the Victoria Police, includingspecialist squads. 1. INTRODUCTION The Federation of Community Legal Centres submits the followingPolice Budget Issues paper to the Finance and Budget division( Premier's Department ) for its consideration in the contextof the August 1992/1993 State Budget. At a time of increasing concern about the operation and managementof Victoria Police, when the economy is in severe recession, unemploymentat its highest levels for 60 years, and amidst claims that theState of Victoria is bankrupt, increased spending on police cannotbe justified. 1.1 Community needs vs police interests The eighties saw the increased politicization of police and policing.The Industrial strength of the Police Association combined withthe media's preoccupation with violent crime, and the close relationshipbetween police and journalists has ensured that law and orderhas emerged as an emotive issue of important political consequence. The industrial and political leverage of the police is such that politicians feel compelled to respond to police demands. With the State government in financial crisis many governmentdepartments have suffered cuts to their budgets. The police budgetduring this period has been maintained and increased along withpolice numbers. In addition police have gained extra powers anddramatic improvements in police industrial conditions includingnine weeks annual leave and a superannuation package the envyof other unions. It is apparent that police and community interests do not alwayscoincide and that many of the gains made by police have been atthe expense of other measures which would have been of real benefitto the community. 1.2 Aim of Submission This paper details government expenditure and the cost each Victorianhas increasingly carried to support the expansion of police resources.The use of misleading information by the police department inits pursuit of increased resources and powers will also be discussed.Given police budget increases over the past five years there appearsto be no legitimate rationale for further increases, except thepolitically expedient response of keeping a powerful lobby group`quiet'. The Federation, alongside many organisations and community groupsshare the concerns of how best to deal with the incidence of crime.We therefore submit a number of recommendations on how to makean effective and efficient use of current police resources. 2. THE 'REALITY' OF CRIME STATISTICS - WHAT THE POLICE DON'T SAY. Police have pushed for increased powers, budgets and numbers largelyon the grounds that crime has increased and police resources arestretched. Rates of crime touted as lawlessness and media headlinesof crime waves have been based on inaccurate and misleading policestatistics. These statistics have been used to distort the natureand extent of the crime problem. A study of the official crimestatistics kept by the Victoria Police actually reveals a substantiallydifferent story. In looking at these figures, we should alsobear in mind that there has been much criticism of the way inwhich police in Victoria compile and define their crime statistics. A spokesperson for Victoria's Attorney General, Mr Jim Kennan,was quoted in the "Sunday Age" of 29 March 1992 as saying: "A major crime index is a major problem. It is extraordinarilymisleading. .....Police and criminal justice agencies had a vested interestin creating the impression of a crime wave.....The temptationis if you want more resources you play up the blood and violence." If we put aside the arguments about the accuracy and reliabilityof the Police Major Crime Statistics, and accept the fact thatan independent body has been created, the Bureau of Criminal Statistics,to analyse and report on crime statistics in the future, we canstill see that the hysteria being generated around "the crimeexplosion" is ill informed and misleading. Relying upon the raw Victoria Police Major Crime Stats, we seethat in the five years from 1986/87 to 1990/91, the total majorcrime reported to the Victoria Police has increased by only 13.02%. Total major crime reports in 1986/87 was 283,666 and in 1990/91it was 320,604. This increase does not allow for growth in population. By allowing for increases in population growth, based on informationprovided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for Victoria,the major crimes reported to Victoria Police increased from 67.8per every thousand people in 1986/87 to 72.6 per every thousandpeople in 1990/91. This represents an increase of only 7.07%in major crimes reported to police in Victoria over the five yearperiod after allowing for a growth in the population. In anyone's terms, an increase of just over 7% in major crimesreported to police over the last five years hardly representsa major blowout in criminal activity as many would have us believe. In the five years from 1986/87, the increase in major crimes againstthe person has been only 12.14% after allowing forpopulation increase. Again this cannot be seen in anyone's termsas a major crime explosion. The incidence of crime can be more accurately viewed in the contextof many factors, ie an increase in reporting and prosecution ofoffences, high urbanisation, increased unemployment - particularlyamongst young people, lower standards of living, general socialand economic indicators related to the current recession. Thepublicised rate of violent crime released by the police mediaunit needs comparison to a well researched paper by the AustralianInstitute of Criminology, where national crime trends indicatethat property crimes outnumber violent crimes by a ratio of 35:1. 3. PUBLIC FEAR CAMPAIGN AND THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA 3.1 Police / Media Relationship The police have a particularly close relationship with the mediabecause the media rely on police for information about crimeswhich are a major source of news. This dependency on police forinformation means that many journalists are careful not to antagonisepolice by writing critical stories, as to do so could result inbeing cut off from a major source of information. Many journalistsalso develop close personal relationships with police becauseof the time they spend socialising with them to develop contacts. Police are further assisted in their dealings with the mediaby a well resourced media bureau which employs, amongst otherstaff, two full time journalists. On the other hand there isno other organisation to which the media can easily turn to inorder to receive alternative information about policing. As aresult many criminal justice issues are written or screened whichsupport a police viewpoint without the balance of other perspectives. 3.2. Role of Police - Public servants or political lobbygroup? The Chief Commissioner enjoys an outspokenness about issues whichis forbidden to other senior public servants. It is generallythought improper for senior public servants to speak publiclyon political issues. The heads of other government departmentsare not permitted to suggest or demand that their own departmentreceive increased resources. Instead it is considered proper forthe appropriate Minister to represent their views in Cabinet.It is clear that the Chief Commissioner of Police does not feelso constrained. The following Media Reports represent just a few examplesof Mr Glare's outspokenness and how police have misused crimestatistics to push for increases in powers and/or resources. * In April 1992 the Chief Commissioner speaking at a meetingof Supporters of Law and Order was reported to have said "Wehave a crime problem in Victoria. It is one of the worst in theWestern world and as a police we are losing the battle". Mr Glare, was reported to have said, he believed Victoria needed1500 to 2000 more police and he could place an extra 1000 immediately.Mr Glare's claim that Victoria has one of the worst crime ratesin the Western world was based on a 1989 study by the AustraliaInstitute of Criminology. The study compared crime rates in 17developed countries. The Chief Commissioner's citing of the studyto support the suggestion that Victoria has one of the worst crimeproblems in the Western world failed to point out two factorswhich resulted in Victoria being placed high in the survey. Australiais by far the most urbanised country of the countries surveyedand this makes a marked difference to the recording of crime. In addition the survey was done in an Australian summer and Europeanwinter. Summer crime rates are about forty per cent higher thanwinter crime rates. Before meaningful comparisons can be madebetween the seventeen countries it is necessary to seasonallyadjust the figures. * The Police Association put out a pamphlet during the lead upto the 1988 State election which began with the statement thatVictorians have a one in four chance of becoming a victim of majorcrime by 1990. For this prediction to have come true, major crimewould have had to have increased by 273% in Victoria in just overone year. The Police Association assertion was a gross distortionof the probability of being a victim of violent crime. * The Assistant Commissioner Mr Frank Green was reported tohave told a law and order meeting in April 1989 that the numberof house burglaries in Victoria had increased 98% in the previousten years. Several weeks earlier the Chief Research officer forthe Crime Department, Detective Chief Inspector George Davis,was reported to have said the burglary rate had remained staticfor some years. The Detective Chief Inspector was reported tohave said "What has happened is that such things as NeighbourhoodWatch have increased public awareness of crimes when they happen." * In 1988 police indicated that they wanted more powers to dealwith people carrying and using knives as weapons. Police claimedthat serious knife assaults and the offence of carrying a knifehad almost doubled between 1984-85 and 1987-88. Using policefigures in support of new legislation in relation to weapons suchas knives the Government claimed that the number of uses of knivesin serious assaults had risen by 86% between 1984-85 and 1987-88. The Law Reform Commission did a lengthy analysis of police statistics. It revealed that statistics had fluctuated from year to year,but 10 year trends showed no significant increase. The Law ReformCommission's report said that when the statistics were adjustedfor population growth and looked at over 10 years, a slight decreasein serious assaults with knives could be seen. It also said thepolice statistics - the only ones available for analysis - wereunreliable because the categories used had changed over the yearsand were "largely subjective". 3.3 Police Inspire Fear Rather than simply responding to crime police are exaggeratingthe crime problem to protect their self interest. Comments madeby the Secretary of the Police Association, Senior Sergeant DannyWalsh, typify the approach taken by police. When police budgetcuts were predicted last year he was reported to have said "Myadvice to the people of Victoria is that they should sleep withone eye open and one hand on a baseball bat because this policeforce will not be able to protect them". After years of stories exaggerating the incidence of crime, manypeople now live with a fear of crime which is out of proportionto the reality of crime. An Australian Bureau of Statistics CrimeSurvey released on 22 December 1987 showed a high degree of publicapprehension about crime. While 73% of those surveyed thoughtthere was a high rate of crime in Victoria, only 18% thought therewas a high rate of crime in their local area. This shows a sharpdifference between people's direct experience of crime and theiroverall perception which is largely shaped by the police drivenmedia. 3.4. Political Response to public perceptions In June 1992 the Assistant Commissioner for Crime Mr Falconerwas reported as being "extremely concerned about the numberof attacks on people in their homes who have become `soft targets'during the recession" This comment is worth comparing to another print media reporta few days later which covered the release of the latest policesurvey on public attitudes to police service. According to a policedepartment press release, " 50% of Victorians surveyed livein fear of being the victim of a violent attack". Surprisingly,the Chief Commissioner Kel Glare is reported as saying "the high level of fear was unfounded given Victoria's relativelylow aggravated burglary statistics" Mr Glare further contradictsMr Falconer's claim by stating " I've been.....in part responsiblefor the creation of fear of crime and I've done that quite deliberatelyand dispassionately". He goes on to say the "fear isunjustified for the majority of people in the sense that theywon't become victims..." The Police Minister's response to recent media coverage of publicfear is of concern. In the same article cited above, Mr Sandon'ssupported " giving the police department more resources andmore power to deal with crimes as well as a range of other measures". Misinformation about the crime problem has resulted in decisionsabout police resources and powers being made on the basis of incorrectinformation and for the sake of political expediency rather thanfor the benefit and protection of the community. The Premier Joan Kirner, said the day after Kel Glare made hiscomments about Victoria having one of the worst crime problemsin the Western World, that she would try to increase police resources. This was despite the fact that the Chief Commissioner's commentswere inaccurate and transparently designed to ensure increasedfunding for police in the upcoming State budget. 3.5. Misuse of police powers When the police campaigned for increased powers to deal with weaponson the basis that there had been an increase in knife attacks,legislation was passed giving the police increased powers evenafter it was shown that the police figures had given the wrongimpression about there being an increase in knife attacks. Whenthe legislation was proposed Legal Services and the VictorianCouncil of Civil Liberties complained that the legislation wasunnecessarily draconian and could result in people being chargedfor carrying objects that were not weapons. The legislation waspassed and as a result police have charged dozens of people withwearing studded belts to keep their pants up. 4. RELEVANCE OF LAW AND ORDER DEBATE TO POLICE DEPARTMENT BUDGET 4.1. Who are our major crime offenders ? A disturbing aspect of police response to crime in Victoria isthe very high over representation of juveniles (defined as personsaged 8-16 years) in the figures for those people taken to courtfor major offences. In 1990/91 juveniles represented 26.57% of all offenders proceededagainst in the major crime classification, and yet representedonly 11% of the population of Victoria. In relation to minor offences, juveniles represented 11.83% ofthose proceeded against which corresponds to their representationamongst the general population. The over-representation of juveniles proceeded against in relationto "major crime" is more concerning when recognitionis given to the fact that juvenile criminal activity is largelyin the area of minor property offences and not major propertyoffences or offences against the person. These figures suggest that police are targeting young people whoare highly visible, easy to apprehend and obtain convictions againstwhilst ignoring serious crime and those responsible for it. 4.2. The statistics for major crimes against the person Although it is of no consolation for those people who are thevictims of major crime against the person, the fact is that thosecrimes represent only 2.16% of all major crime, as defined bythe Victoria Police, reported during 1990/91. As a percentageof all offences reported to police during 1990/91, these majorcrimes against the person were only 1.57% of the total. In contrast to major crimes against the person, very minor offences(defined as "other offences" in police crime statistics)represented 27.14% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91,up from 24.01% in 1986/7. Allowing for population increase, minoroffences have increased from 21.4 offences per 1,000 people in1986/7 to 27.0 offences per 1,000 people in 1990/91. This representsa 26.16% increase in minor offences in real terms during thisperiod. This is more than four times the increase in "majorcrime" for the same period. Victoria is experiencing a majorblowout in minor offences and not a crime wave. Stealing, not including burglary and theft of motor vehicles,represented 30.21% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91. The second largest category of all offences reported to policewas "other offences" which represented 27.14% of alloffences reported in 1990/91. Thus nearly 60% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91related to either minor summary offences or allegations of stealing. The big four in terms of number of offences reported to VictorianPolice in 1990/91 were: 1. Theft - 30.21% of total offences reported. 2. Other Offences - 27.14% " " " " 3. Burglary - 21.39% " " " " 4. Fraud - 11.55% " " " " These represent 9 out of 10 of all offences reported to the VictoriaPolice in 1990/91. 4.3. Police response to where violent crime is most prevalent A substantial amount of police time is used responding to callsrelating to domestic violence. However research indicates thatpolice do not assist women when they attend because of attitudeswhich attach inappropriate stereotypes to male and female behaviour. Police refuse to lay criminal charges even when there is evidenceof serious assaults and the victim wants the perpetrator charged.Women are almost always left to fend for themselves or rely onorganisations other than police to deal with the criminal aspectsof their partners behaviours. According to the 1992 police survey on public attitudes to policeservice, 92% of respondents believed police should intervene indomestic violence. Given the appalling statistics on police inaction(1990 -1991 court monitoring statistics show police acted as complainantsin only 3.42% of applications for Intervention Orders), this wouldappear to be a clear mandate by the community for police to seriouslyreview its current `service' to women in violent relationships. The AIC homicide monitoring in close collaboration with the AustralianPolice Ministers Council (APMC) has also found that violent crimeis most often perpetrated within the family where the victim knowsthe offender. One has to seriously question the expending of policeresources on new crime squads, and foot patrols when the reportedproblem in dealing with domestic violence is police inaction afterintervention. The police inaction in domestic violence should be compared totheir zeal in other areas. For example under Control of Weaponslegislation the police are charging dozens of people with wearingstudded belts for the purpose of keeping their pants up. Thatan organisation that continually claims to be under resourcedcan engage in laying such frivolous charges is remarkable. For a decade police told the public that Operation Noah, the annualdrugs phone in, was catching the "Mr Bigs" dealing inhard drugs. An analysis of the statistics from the phone in doneby the Federation of Community Legal Centres found that chargesarising out of the phone-in were overwhelmingly for use and possessionof marijuana. As a result of the analysis done by the Federationand the publicity given to the figures the phone-in has now beendiscontinued. 4.4 Overseas Lessons There are overseas examples where the push for law and order byvested interests has driven government policies on increased powersand resources for police. Under Margaret Thatcher strong law andorder policies have resulted in an escalation of violence, aspolice increased their numbers and visibility. Similar analogiescan be drawn with the American experience. In comparison, France is the only western country in the lastten years which has reported a marked reduction in the incidenceof crime. Its' implementation of crime prevention strategies asrecommended in the Bonnemaison report deviated significantly fromAmerican and English `get tough' policies. France has directedits resources to crime prevention strategies which aim to improvethe quality of life through the relief of unemployment, housing,community involvement and greater police accountability. Whilst this model cannot be superimposed on the Victorian situation(as has been poorly attempted in a 1987 pilot program), the principlesunderpinning its approach to crime prevention should be used asa reference point in determining where scarce government resourcesshould be directed. Ample evidence exists of the high costs andlow returns in maintaining traditional crime control bodies (police,courts and prisons). Consideration of budget priorities shouldtake note of these experiences and available research. 5. COSTS TO THE COMMUNITY 5.1. Who Pays ? For each year in the past decade, Victorians have gained 161.2additional police officers on average per year, at an averageyearly cost of $31.9 million. On the basis of these figures, it can be seen that each additionalpolice officer has cost Victorians $197,890 per police officerper year. At an average annual price tag of nearly $200,000 peryear a decision to increase police numbers must be very carefullyconsidered. In 1981/82 policing cost each Victorian $59.38. In 1990/91 weeach pay $125.56 per year for our police. At the end of this10 year period each one of us has to find an additional $66.18each year to pay for our police force. 5.2 `Overstretched' Police Force ? In the decade from 1981/82 to 1990/91 expenditure by Victorianson their police force has increased by 135.3%, exceeding the CPIinflation rate for the same period by 27.9%. At the beginning of this decade, the Victorian Police programoutlays were $235,707,000. By the end of the decade they hadreached $554,505,000, an increase of almost $319,000,000. This represents an average of $31.9 million additional expenditureon police by Victorians each year for the past 10 years. In terms of police personnel, Victorians have obtained an additional1,612 police officers for their extra $319,000,000 outlayed in1990/91. This represents a 19.09% increase in police officers during thedecade. In 1981/82 8,444 people held the special privilege, responsibilityand powers that Victorians give to their police officers. By1990/91 this number had grown to 10,056. 5.3. What are police priorities ? In 1990/91 the Victorian Police spent 33.3% of their total budgeton Corporate Services. In contrast, expenditure on local policestations, known as Community Based Policing in the police budget,represented 49.8% of total Expenditure with a further 1.38% beingspent on Operations Support Services. Operation Support Services covers such things as the FirearmsRegistry, State Bicycle Co-ordination, Neighbourhood Watch, Policein Schools, Co-ordination of Community Policing Squads, childexploitation investigation and family violence, as well as liaisonwith ethnic Aboriginal and gay communities. All of these itemsshared 1.38% of Victoria Police expenditure in 1990/91. As of June 1992 the budget allocation for the Media Director'sOffice totalled over 1 million dollars. According to the FamilyViolence Prevention Unit, the training of police officers on domesticviolence amounted to a `few overheads taken to police stationswhere attitude problems are identified'. Apart from the policeacademy there is little training at a police station level. Giventhe inappropriate use of the media (as cited above), the budgetexpenditure on the media unit is a gross misallocation of resources. 6.CONCLUSION What is needed is a responsible, informed discussion on crimeprevention and control in reaching decisions on police budgetallocation. The consistent knee jerk or politically expedientresponse to meet police demands is not in the interestof greater community safety. The Federation strongly believes that an increase in police resourcescannot be justified. With one of the highest police to populationratios in the industrialised world an increase in police personnelis ludicrous. Two directions are open to Victoria: 1. If we choose to support the creation of a police state thenwe can rest on current government and opposition policies to furtherincrease police powers, numbers and resources. 2. If we want a `healthy' society where crime is tackled fromits root causes then we can choose to implement social justiceprograms and non-police crime prevention strategies. Labor's recent pledge to increase police numbers and budget isthe wrong move for a state at the crossroads of its law and orderdirection. We know from overseas experience and available research that thegreater the inequality that exists within a society the more violentand oppressive are its living conditions. Given the: high levelsof unemployment; increasing disparity between the `haves and havenots'; depth of the current recession, and the general gloominessbeing experienced by Victorians today, it is reasonable to supposethat need is playing a large part in the level of criminal offencesbeing reported to police. To increase government spending on police not only drains thestate economy ,but depletes those scarce resources which can beallocated to other areas such as health, education, housing andemployment which clearly impact on crime prevention. Insteadof rewarding a department which prioritises self interest oversafety, increased accountability is needed over current policespending.

Box 1139K GPO Melbourne 3000 Victoria Australia Tel: 61 03 9602 4949 Fax: 61 03 9602 4948 Disclaimer:The Views Expressed in this paper may or may not be supportedby the Fitzroy Legal Service. Inference as to the degree of supportor otherwise as offered by the Fitzroy Legal Service as an organizationor its staff or volunteers should not be drawn. ISSUES 1. The Federation is of the view that current LACV funding ofduty lawyer services should not be extended to the Family Courtjurisdiction until a needs analysis is done, to see ifthere is a real need for such a service to exist. On the basisof the information provided, it will then be possible to determinethe type of service that is necessary. We note that the natureof cases in this jurisdiction can be quite emotive and legallycomplex. Often issues of Property Law and Taxation can apply.We understand however, that the current unremunerated scheme operatingin Dandenong has been a success. The Federation is of the view that a duty lawyer scheme is requiredin relation to intervention orders, however, we are of the viewthat a holistic approach to this sensitive area needs to be adoptedwith special training for the lawyers concerned which could beco-ordinated and resourced through the Women's Legal ResourceGroup (given their expertise in this area). This will be discussedin more detail later by the Group. The Federation does believe there may be a need for the extensionof the duty-lawyer scheme into the Family Court jurisdiction ofthe Magistrates' Court. It is the experience of our members thatoften unrepresented parties find themselves railroaded by practitionerson the other side into making concessions. As a great number ofdeterminations of the court are done by consent, there is verylittle scope to protect the unrepresented person's interests.The Federation would not recommend a duty -lawyer scheme in thiscontext if the case were of a complex nature. Representation incomplex Family Law matters requires extensive preparation thatcannot be handled within the limitations of a duty- lawyer scheme. 2. The Federation is sceptical about any introduction of a commonstructure for all duty lawyer schemes funded by the LACV. It believesthat investigation into the different variables such as the region,different court practices, the degree of specialisation necessary,other services available within the area, work loads, the typeof law and the needs arising out of that type would all be factorswhich have a bearing on the structure of such a scheme . It wouldtherefore depend on the model being adopted and why it was adopted.Clearly this question is difficult to answer until further investigationhas occurred. 3. The Federation is of the view that current accreditationis inadequate. We believe that a general advocacy course atLeo Cussen is not sufficiently geared to the nature of duty- lawyerwork. We would submit that a person who has been a duty-lawyerand who is aware of ongoing developments should be the trainer.Duty-Lawyering is not like general court advocacy. It involvesa race against time, dealing with a number of clients one afteranother, an ability to quickly familiarise oneself with the lawand facts of the case and the ability to think quickly on one'sfeet. It is stressful and only someone who has been exposed tothe type of practice involved will have developed survival strategiesthat would be of real assistance. Those currently practising asduty lawyers would need to be re-accredited but we are suggestingthat such accreditation would need to be renewed periodicallyin any event. The Federation is also concerned about the situation with respectto duty-lawyers in rural areas. Despite the existence of trainingfor lawyers in rural areas it would appear this is done on anad hoc basis, depending on how disciplined the co-ordinators ofthe private practitioner programmes are in those rural areas.It is suggested that the requirement of accreditation and trainingbe applied more rigourously to assist the often young practitionersin those areas. 4.We have a number of concerns about the current structuring ofthe delivery of legal aid services by private practitioners. TheFederation does not believe that the tendering of the serviceto private practitioners should be based solely on who can providethe cheapest service. There are more issues to consider thansaving money when endeavouring to improve access to justice. Thequality of the service of the practitioner must be a substantialcriteria for selection. They must be professional and must havea knowledge of community services available to the client, a certainlevel of committment to ensuring just outcomes, have a knowledgeof the relevant law and changes to it, an ability to relate toclients and work with stress, a desire to enter an ongoing trainingregime, an ability to present a plea effectively and have relevantexperience in the area which is the subject of the service. Wedo not believe that tendering of services should merely be a gentleman'sagreement but rather should be subject to a detailed list of demonstrablecriteria. In summary, the Federation believes that the best option isfor either a properly resourced LACV duty-lawyer scheme or a dutylawyer service attached to a Community Legal Centre. Only wherethis is not practicable, for instance in isolated country areas,should a tender/ franchising scenario for private practitioners operate and then with tight quality controls, the type of personbeing taken into account along with training and the meetingof criteria as outlined earlier. The Federation also believes that the current practice of tenderingthe duty lawyer scheme out to an entire firm of solicitors (particularlyin country areas) detracts from accountability. Individuals ratherthan firms should be enlisted and then accreditation and qualityservice can be more tightly controlled. In addition, it is notedthat in the country, often senior experienced solicitors sit incourt waiting all morning for their case to come on whilst a younglawyer from the same firm acts as duty lawyer.This seems an unecessarywaste of resources. Perhaps practitioners could be requested toensure this does not occur. We note that in some of the smallercourts in the country there is no duty-lawyer scheme at all egHorsham&Ararat despite there being a need. 5. Yes, a review of fees should occur. 6. No, services currently provided by duty-lawyers should notbe generally opened up to private practitioners. The standardsoutlined in paragraph 4 of this letter for private practitionersshould be the same as those applied to LACV duty lawyers i.e.accreditation and ongoing training. 7. We believe that the issue as to establishing a Family Courtduty-lawyer scheme should not be taken until after a detailedneeds analysis can occur. The outcome of the analysis would helpto determine the form any service would take. Given the complexitiesof this jurisdiction as already outlined, we believe that if sucha jurisdiction were taken on by LACV or CLC's they would haveto ensure that the practitioner was experienced in the FamilyLaw jurisdiction. 8. As stated earlier, the answer to this question depends on theneeds analysis. The conditions for franchising and tendering wouldneed to have specific criteria as outlined in paragraph 4 of thisletter. To tender on the basis of cost alone does not really ensureaccess or quality of service in any real sense . As Donald Robinsonstates in The Alternative Law Journal, Vol19, No.1 1994,p. 17, quoting Cappelletti, The Judicial Process in ComparativePerspective, Clarendon Press, 1989, p.237 'There must be 'effective equality and a process in which eventhe economically weaker party has a real, rather than a mere illusory, opportunity to be heard' 9. See paragraph 4and 3 in relation to accreditation and training. 10&11. The Federation is not very familiar with the operationof the 'On Call ' system but would like to be advised about itsform of operation and provide input. 12. The Federation believes accreditation and quality controlin representation in the Children's Court should be along thelines already outlined in this letter but with added trainingfocusing on the sensitivities involved in taking instructionsfrom children and the need for simple language. 13. The Women's Legal Resource Group will provide input on InterventionOrders as promised on Monday,17th July. Other Issues Before concluding there were some other areas which the Federationis concerned about. As highlighted the duties of the duty lawyerare often onerous and stressful.We note that particularly in somemetropolitan and rural areas (such as Warrnambool) there are fewfacilities for duty-lawyers. They must rely on the good natureof the Registrar to use a phone, cite an Act, borrow a phone booketc. We believe that all duty-lawyers should be provided withthe facilities to do their job effectively and given the timedemands already on their hands to enable them to concentrate onthe real tasks at hand. An up to date list of community servicesshould be on hand. We have heard tales of STD phone bars preventingconsultations with Legal Aid and other like services. We submitthis only makes an already difficult job tougher. We recognise that another difficulty with the provision of duty-lawyerservices is that the on-going stresses result in practitionerssuffering 'burnout'. The training and accreditation proceduresmentioned in this submission may assist in reducing this difficultyand provide for further support.

INTRODUCTION A previously unreleased report by Victoria Policeon the Impact of Equal Opportunity on Policing in Victoria , obtainedby the Federation of Community Legal Centres under Freedom ofInformation legislation, reveals that Victoria Police unlawfullydiscriminate against women. This discrimination contravenes equalopportunity legislation. The purpose of this report, `Brute Force - TheNeed for Affirmative Action in the Victoria Police Force',is to identify recruitment policies and practices that prohibitequal participation by women in the police force. `Brute Force'recommends crucial changes to the recruitment and promotion practicesthat have historically institutionalised unlawful discriminationwithin the force and promoted a work place culture out of stepwith community expectations and attitudes. The preamble to the Victorian Equal OpportunityAct 1984 states that it is `An Act to render unlawful certainkinds of discrimination, to promote equality of opportunity betweenpersons of different status...and for other purposes.' Discrimination against female applicants to the policeforce and female police officers takes the form of discriminationin recruitment and promotion along with sexual harassment andinequitable working conditions. Unlawful discrimination in recruitment denies thosewomen in Victoria who wish to join the force a fair chance ofgaining such employment. It ensures that those women who are successfulin obtaining such employment remain only a small minority unableto challenge a status quo that largely excludes female experienceand perspectives. The marginal position of women in the policeforce is reinforced by discrimination in promotion which contributesto the small number of women in the higher ranks of the force. The small number of female officers and females insenior positions combined with the attitudes that underlie discriminationin recruitment and employment has implications for the type ofservice women in the community receive from the police force. It also has implications for policing practices generally. It is essential that the issue of discriminatoryrecruitment and promotion practises be addressed immediately inlight of the coalition government's election promise to increasethe number of police by one thousand. MEN AND WOMEN IN THE POLICE FORCE As at June, 1992, women made up 14.4% of the 10,025members in the Victoria Police. Of the 447 police who are of therank of Inspector or higher, only 8 (or 1.8%) are women. As in1991, there were 6 Inspectors and 1 Chief Inspector and 1 AssistantCommissioner. In the Metropolitan area women make up about twentyper cent of police but in the country they make up less than tenper cent of police numbers. The small number of female policein country areas, maternity leave and other forms of leave thatfemale officers take, result in vast geographical areas not havingaccess to female officers. The implications of this are discussedfurther on in this report. Female police are largely confined to welfare, domesticand administrative roles within the police force. While womenmake up the majority of members within the Community PolicingSquad (CPS) they are not represented, or very poorly represented,in what are considered `real' policing areas, such as the CriminalInvestigation Branch (CIB), The Homicide Squad, The Special OperationsGroup and Search and Rescue. It is no coincidence that the squadsthat exclude women altogether are considered the elite in thepolice force. The Homicide Squad which has never had a femalemember is described as the `elite of the elite' within the force. The Special Operations Group has always been an all male squad and is also know as the `Sons of God'. A name that signals thatthe squad is both elite and for men only. At least one former police officer has commentedpublicly that the integration of female police into operationalduties has had a bad effect on morale in the force. The report predicts that based on trends over theprevious five years, the proportion of females in the VictoriaPolice in 1993 will be in excess of 17% of total strength. Thisprediction has not proved accurate. Given that in the last four years, the proportionof females in the force has increased from 14% to only 14.4%,the estimate was unduly optimistic particularly given the declinein the success of female applicants to the force since 1988, asdiscussed below. RECRUITMENT The report acknowledges that women who apply to jointhe police force are more likely to fail to gain admittance thanmales who apply to join. There are four tests required to be takenby applicants to the force each of which must be passed in orderfor the applicant to be admitted. These four tests are an educationtest; an agility test; an interview with a selection panel; anda medical examination. The Agility Test The major reason so few women are recruited is thatthey fail to pass a physical agility test. A new agility testwas introduced in January 1989. The report states that since theintroduction of this test the female pass rate dropped 24% from57% in 1988 to 33% in 1989, while the male pass rate remainedat 88%. The report does not provide any explanation as to whythe test was introduced. The agility test discriminates againstwomen in a number of ways. The agility test includes a fat test. The currentbody fat measures allow males 21% body fat and females 24% bodyfat. The body fat rates for an average male is 18% and a femaleis 28%. Women naturally have greater than 10% more body fat thanmen. Women have more fat cells than men, and the cells are larger. The test requires that females must have four per cent lessbody fat than the average female while males who pass are allowedthree per cent more body fat than the average male. In other words women need to be leaner than average to pass theforce's fat test while men can be flabbier than average and stillpass. However, the report erroneously states that the allowablebody fat ratios accurately represent the physiological differencesbetween men and women. The fat test requirement is clearly discriminationwithin the definition of discrimination in the Equal OpportunityAct 1984 in that it is more difficult for females to passsuch a test than males and it is not a reasonable test. In addition the agility tests has a pronounced emphasison upper body strength. Just over two-thirds of female applicantsfail the part of the agility test which requires great upper bodystrength. Only 11% of male applicants fail these tests. Women, relative to men have more strength in theirlower body than upper body. Women's leg strength is significantlycloser to men's than is their arm strength. Whilst a test thatlooked at overall strength would fail more women than men, becauseon average men are stronger than women, a test which primarilytests upper body strength will fail significantly more women thanmen. The report comments that applicants who fail thetest can go away and build themselves up and apply for the testagain. This does not address the question of discrimination butamounts to advising those people who fail, mainly women, to goaway and work to make themselves more like men. The agility test,like the fat test, discriminates unlawfully against women. Selection Panel Interviews An interview before a Selection Panel assesses theapplicants character, background, motivation, capability, maturity,social attitudes and general suitability for a police career. More female applicants than male fail this test. Forty-four per cent of female recruits surveyed forthe report claimed to have experienced sex discrimination in theinterview, including sexist language, disparaging comments, questionsof marital status and comments on female ineffectiveness or theirphysical limitations, despite the fact that these women had alreadypassed the agility test. No males claimed that they had experiencedsex discrimination in the interview. Selection panels have beenpredominantly all male and there is no policy on gender compositionof panels, unlike the Public Service which requires mixed-genderpanels. The report claims that these problems have now been addressed. However there is no indication that there is a policy in placewhich requires women on the selection panels. Given the problemswith the panels in the past such a policy is obviously necessaryto ensure that women applicants are not discriminated against. Such a policy is also necessary to ensure that men with inappropriateattitudes toward women are not accepted into the force. Education and Medical Examinations These two tests appear to be fair and not to involvediscrimination against female applicants. PROMOTION Those women who become police are less likely thanmen to be promoted in the force. As stated previously, the reportfound that females are proportionately under represented in thehigher ranks of the Victoria Police. It also found that a muchhigher proportion of females with more than ten years servicehad not attained the supervisory ranks of their male counterparts. There has been virtually no change in the representation of womenin the higher ranks in the past ten years. When a police officer is eligible for promotion,selection for a position involves a procedure of application andscreening. A selection panel is usually convened to assess therelative efficiency and suitability of applicants for appointmentto a position. The panel then recommends the most suitable applicant. A selection panel must be convenedfor appointment to all officers positions, and all positions ofSenior Sergeant in charge of a police station. Selection panels comprise a convenor, who must beat least two ranks senior to the vacant position and have managementresponsibility for the position; an independent member appointedfrom outside the district, who is at least one rank senior tothe position; a third member at least one rank senior to the position,and should be in the immediate line supervisor/commander of theposition; and where appropriate, an additional member where theposition involves specialist or technical skills. The guidelines stipulate that where a female memberis an applicant for the position, one member of the selectionpanel, where practicable, should be a female memberat least one rank senior to the position. However, the reportalso makes it clear that the boards have usually been made upof all male police officers. The report noted that there was evidence that femaleapplicants for promotions have been questioned on their maritalstatus, ability to combine policing with family commitments, andtheir general capability to deal with male subordinates. Thephysical capabilities of females has also often been challenged. The report found that across all ranks, but particularlySergeant rank and below, there was a degree of gender discriminationin promotions boards and transfers. These factors no doubt contributeto the low number of female high ranking policewomen. The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 makes it unlawfulto discriminate in promotion. Section 21(2) of the Act states: "It is unlawful for an employer to discriminateagainst an employee on the ground of status or by reason of theprivate life of the employee - (a) by denying the employee access, or limitingaccess by the employee, to opportunities for promotion,transfer or training or to any other benefits connected with employment;" The report recommends that promotional board membersbe given instructions and guidelines on the provisions of theEqual Opportunity Act. This would include guidelines in interviewingtechniques incorporating Equal Opportunity issues being providedto all potential promotion board members. It is clear that there is a need for promotionalboards to be comprised of both males and females and the reportrecommends this. However it waters down this recommendation byincluding the words "wherever possible", stating thatincluding males and females on these boards and panels may notalways be feasible with the low number of policewomen of officerrank at present. This is a `Catch 22' situation. Women have beendiscriminated against in promotion as a result of all male panelsand this has contributed to their small numbers in the higherranks of the force. Because there are few women in the higherranks of the police force, panels will continue to be all male,when their are not sufficient women of high enough rank to beon them. The absence of a clear affirmative action guidelineson the composition of promotion boards will result in the continuedsmall number of policewomen of high rank. In order to break this vicious cycle and to ensurethat there are more female police represented in higher ranksthere needs to be an adoption of affirmative action in the selectionof police for promotion. Such a policy would go some way towards recognisingthat there has been discrimination against women in the past andthat an increase in the number of female senior police is necessaryto ensure that female experience and perceptions are taken intoaccount in the implementation and formulation of police policyand practise. FEMALE POLICE Employment conditions The report noted the absence of a number of key employmentconditions resulted in problems in staff retention. These conditionsincluded: part time policing, parental leave, job sharing andthe availability of child care facilities. The lack of thesejob conditions has a greater effect on female police than malepolice. As a result women are less likely to stay in the forceand further their policing careers. In addition women will bemore likely than men to be discouraged from applying to join thepolice force due to the lack of these employment conditions. Sexual Harassment The report found that sexually harassing behaviourwas quite common throughout the Victoria Police. What the reportdescribes as "more serious incidents" such as touchingand sexual advances, were believed to occur relatively infrequently.However, more common behaviour such as displays of magazines andpictures of a sexual nature and sexual jokes were viewed as "partof police culture", in spite of the fact that a large proportionof both male and female police found such behaviour to be offensive. An example of the sexist perceptions of gender roleswithin the force appeared in the March 1992 edition of PoliceLife, an official police force publication. An article titled`Not Just a Pretty Face', described the first female policewomanto receive a valour award as "attractiv"'. In a subsequentPolice Life edition, the editor admitted that had the subjectof the article been a policeman, the author (a male) would nothave used these descriptions, but still denied the use of thesedescriptions amounted to sexism. The report found that 20% of police officers reportedhaving subordinates come to them with complaints of sexual harassment.The most commonly reported complaint was of male supervisors harassingjunior females. Women suffering sexual harassment within thepolice force may find it difficult to complain about their treatmentwithin the force given that they will have to complain to someonemore senior who, in the overwhelming majority of cases, will bea man and it is likely to be a superior who is the perpetratorof the harassment. Sexual harassment is unlawful under section 20 (1)(a) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984. In July, 1992, five Victorian policewomen lodgeda complaint with the Equal Opportunity Board. They claimed thatthey had notified the police force but that no action had beentaken. The five women alleged that they were physically and sexuallyharassed at a police station. An article in Police Life, quoted the thenAssistant Commissioner, Bernice Masterson, on the subject of sexualharassment. Former Assistant Commissioner Masterson said "itis exacerbated by our rank structure. Vast attitude changes wouldbe required for the problem to be completely wiped out. As themore junior members come up through the ranks, possibly it willbe less of a problem as women are becoming far more accepted inthe force." Given the low representation of women in the ranksof Sergeant, Senior Sergeant, Inspector and above, and the littlegrowth in the numbers of women in these ranks over the last tenyears, (see footnote 20) it is most probable that the problemwill remain for quite some time unless the force ensures thataffirmative action is practised in recruitment and promotion. WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE OF POLICING Criminal Assault in the Home Criminal assault in the home is an extremely seriousand wide spread crime. Women and children are largely the victimsof this crime and men the perpetrators. A woman is far more likelyto be assaulted in her home by a man she is or has been in a relationshipwith than by a stranger. By far the largest category of reportedhomicides consist of those classed as `domestics' and in abouthalf of these homicides there had been at least one prior incidentof physical abuse, almost always involving the wife or defactopartner as victim. Police consistently fail to treat criminal assaultin the home as `real' police work and fail to enforce the lawto protect women and children. Their inaction when it comes toarresting violent offenders when the crime is assault in the homeplaces women and children in danger and serves to reinforce themyth that violence against people in the home is not a crime. Research undertaken into the behaviour of policewhen dealing with domestic violence has found that the majorityhold sexist and stereotyped views about men and women. Attacksby men upon women in the domestic context are excused by policeofficers, on the basis that women ask for it, deserve their beatingor like violence. The violence against women in these situationsis trivialised and officers frequently identify with the man.Women victims of assault are often perceived as hysterical andmentally unstable. As one researcher put it, police cast women "asfailures or oppressors and men as heroic victims". Theseattitudes are sometimes excused or explained on the grounds thatthey only reflect attitudes in the community. While it is truethat surveys have found that an alarming significant minorityof the general public find domestic violence acceptable researchhas shown that the majority of police have attitudeswhich condone or excuse such violence. Research comparing theattitude of police and other professionals to domestic violencefound that police saw domestic violence as a less severe problemthan did any of the other professionals, showed the least sympathyfor the victim and held the most stereotyped view of women. The police are a public service paid to enforce the law. It isunacceptable that these public servants are unable to offer servicesto women in a non discriminatory fashion. Most incidents of familyviolence reported to the police occur outside normal businesshours. Often the police are the only available service."Research findings all over the world point universally tothe crucial role the police play in being the first and in manycases the only point of contact for a victim of family violence. At the same time we read about the reluctance of police to act,to assist and/or to follow through with the protection and advicedesperately needed by the victims who report abuse to the police." The failure of police to provide a proper service to women indomestic violence situations clearly endangers women's lives. A family law solicitor told a Victorian Committee inquiring intocommunity violence that "if police responded actively tocalls for assistance in situations of domestic violence by layingcriminal charges...some homicides may be prevented".2 Female victim/survivors of domestic violence areclearly unhappy with the police service they receive and reportdeep disappointment and frustration at police inaction. Recent research indicates that one of the reasonswomen do not seek police assistance in domestic violence situationsis that the overwhelming majority of police are male. Women whoparticipated in this research found the CPS, which is made upmainly of women, to be more responsive to their needs. Rape Like victims of domestic violence female victims/survivorsof rape cannot depend on police assistance or sympathy. It iswell known that the police treat with suspicion women's reportsof rape. One study of rapes reported to Victoria police foundthat 34.5% of reports were not proceeded with due to police assessmentsthat there was insufficient evidence or a false report had beenmade. The now disbanded Victorian Police Complaints Authorityundertook a study on police response to victims of sexual assaultafter receiving many complaints that police treated victims ofrape as if they were guilty of something themselves. Their discussionpaper contains a number of case studies which illustrates thispoint. The Police Complaints Authority paper comments that "theattitudes of some members of the police remain sexist, stereotypedand judgmental, ... unnecessarily distressing and alienating thosefemale victims who come forward, and discouraging others fromreporting crimes." A recently held Victorian sexual assault phone-infound that two-thirds of callers had never reported the assaultto police. The report on the phone-in concludes that: "Thereasons callers gave for not reporting these assaults indicatea significant lack of faith in the legal system, and widespreadcynicism about police responses". Many of those who reportedrapes felt that reporting had been `a waste of time' and thatthey had been let down by the legal system. Dissatisfaction relatedto attitudes and comments expressed by individual police officers,as well as to more general police procedures and methods of investigation. The victims who were dissatisfied found the police to be unsympathetic. They said the police asked inappropriate and irrelevant questionsand made them feel disbelieved, uncomfortable, devalued, guiltyor blamed. Victims were more likely to make positive commentsabout the police when female officers were involved, and a significantnumber of callers made a distinction between their positive experienceswith members of the CPS and more negative ones with members ofthe CIB. They felt there was greater sympathy and support offeredby members of the CPS in contrast to the CIB. The CPS has about85% female membership while the CIB is predominantly male. Women in police custody One in four people arrested by the police are female. Apart from the general psychological and physical abuse whichsometimes takes place in police custody, women are often subjectto abuse of a sexual nature. The very fact that the overwhelmingmajority of police officers are male puts women in a vulnerableposition when they enter police custody. A survey done by the Federation of Community LegalCentres on police mistreatment of young people included a numberof reports of police sexual assault of women. One woman reportedthe following: "A police car pulled up, asked me what I wasdoing, and told me to get in the car. I was taken back to thepolice station, through a back door, and told to strip. I wasquestioned whilst I was naked, and police tried to insert an instrument.They then hit and kicked me." The Coroner investigating a number of fatal shootingsby police was told by a woman that she witnessed police sexuallyassault her friend with a gun and later found another friend deeplydistressed in another room saying that the police had sexuallyassaulted him. The woman gave evidence at the Coroner's Courtthat: "... at about 10.45pm when the police sledgehammered the door down and came running through the place... Dougran out the back. The police went out the back and fired threeshots, and then they came back in laughing and said, " Weput one in him". We were crying. They said that would nothelp. They punched Diane and put a long barrelled gun betweenher legs... There was a young kid about eighteen,... who was stayingin the front room... They punched him, pulled down his pants andput a gun up his behind. He was screaming and crying. Afterwardshe told us what happened. He had marks on his neck and all overhim." Aboriginal women are massively over represented amongst women who are arrested. They are not only subject toracist abuse but also sexual abuse by police. The Inquiry IntoRacist Violence heard that Aboriginal women were physically abusedby police, raped and threatened with rape. Given that sexualassault is almost exclusively perpetrated by men, women and childrenwould be far less likely to suffer sexual threats and abuse atthe hands of police if more police officers were female. Country women As a result of the low numbers of female police officersin the country women who are raped or assaulted are less likelythan city women to be able to act on any preference to speak toa woman about such crimes. Country women face particular problemswhen the perpetrator of the violence against them is a `mate'of the local police officer or worse still when it is the localpolice officer himself. These factors combined with other moregeneral issues involved in living in small rural communities suchas isolation, distance, lack of privacy and being economicallydependent on family enterprises, makes it less likely that countrywomen will report violent crimes against them. Strip searchingof female suspects will more often be carried out by male officersin the country because of lack of female officers and more femalesuspects will be interviewed, detained etc in an all male environment. Pornographic materials in police stations Community legal centres have received a number ofcomplaints from people about the display of pornographic postersin police stations. Display of such materials in police stationsis totally unacceptable and demonstrates that there is littleunderstanding or concern amongst police that such materials arelikely to distress women who enter police stations. STYLES OF POLICING It is the perception of legal centres, based on thereported experience of their clients, that police officers frequentlyengage in violent and unlawful attacks upon members of the public.It is clear that the most vulnerable members of the communityincluding aboriginal people and young homeless people are morelikely than others to be subjected to police violence. It is reportedthat police officers often respond to any perceived affront totheir authority with physical force. Young people, in particular,report that if they attempt to assert their rights in dealingswith the police they are often physically assaulted or threatenedwith physical assault. It appears that some police provoke confrontationsbetween citizens and themselves by approaching their duties inan overly aggressive and hostile manner. It is our view thatmany young people at eighteen and a half (the minimum age forrecruitment) are too immature to properly undertake the responsibilitiesand powers that go with the provision of police uniform and weapons,including guns. It is our perception that this is particularlytrue of young men who too often bring to the job the desire totest their manhood through physical confrontation with others. The fact that the police force is overwhelmingly male contributesto a culture within the police force whereby physical strengthand confrontation is glorified and other perspectives which includealternative methods of conflict resolution are undervalued ordismissed. CONCLUSION The emphasis on brute force in recruiting definesthe policing ethos as one of physical confrontation rather thanservice to the community. The former Minister for Police, Mal Sandon, publiclystated that the community are the police and the police are thecommunity. This is clearly not the case. Over half of the communityare female whilst only 14.4% of the police force is female. Ifwe are to have a police force that is more truly representativeof the community then it is imperative that the number of womenas a proportion of the police force increase. Such an increase will only occur if there is a removalof discrimination in recruitment combined with affirmative actionboth in recruitment and in promotion. A commitment to affirmative action requires the recognitionthat the current male domination of the police force is to a largepart responsible for a culture of violence within the force andthe inadequate response to female victims of crime. An increase in the number of women in the force shouldbe accompanied by a fundamental change in the nature of policingaway from confrontation and brute force and towards a more conciliatorystyle of policing. If the police are genuine in their commitment tocommunity policing they must ensure that the force is more representativeof the community and capable of giving appropriate service toall of the community, including women.

Inference as to the degree of supportor otherwise as offered by the Fitzroy Legal Service as an organizationor its staff or volunteers should not be drawn. This submission is made on behalf of the National Associationof Community Legal Centres. We submit on the basis of our broadranging and hands-on experience with complaints mechanisms andpolice issues in various State Jurisdictions. Introduction: The experience of Community Legal Centres in dealing with complaintsagainst police has lead to a stongly held view that all aspectsof those complaints must be dealt with independently of the AustralianFederal Police service including the Commissioner. A separate"Commission" or "Complaints Authority" withfar reaching powers of investigation should be established. Suchan Authority must have powers to initiate investigations in apro-active manner with a view protecting the reputation of theAFP and preventing the abuse of power. It must have the resourcesnecessary to investigate complaints received and where ever possibleto engage in proactive steps to prevent the causes of complaintsarising. Powers to make recommendations on systemic change mustcompliment its investigative functions. The proposed authority should be established as a model for allstates to emulate and should adopt independent external investigationand adjudication powers in relation to all complaints againstpolice as recommended by the Royal Commission into AboriginalDeaths in Custody. Public confidence in the investigation of police complaints is,in the experience of CLC's assisting members of the public withcomplaints of police mistreatment and abuse of power, directlyrelated to the real and perceived independence of the complaintsauthority. The view that "Caesar should not judge Caesar"is in our experience a very strongly held view among Australianswhen it comes to the issue of complaints against police. The ever increasing powers being given to police, and the likelihoodthat additional powers will be given to the AFP, requires thatpublic confidence in police complaints mechanisms be achieved. Nothing less than the independent authority referred to abovewill satisfy the confidence of the Australian people. It is vital whatever mechanism is adopted to deal with complaintsthat the process be as open and transparent as possible. Furthermore,public accountability by means of "comprehensive" annualreports is vital if the public are to have any faith in the complaintsprocess. The appropriate level of accountability that should be requiredof the AFP must be that designed to prevent the abuse of power. It must be external, independent and discourage systemic andindividual abuse. This level of accountability must apply tothe powers granted by the community to our police to carry outtheir vital role on our behalf, as well as to the process of investigating complaints about police. Whilst the scope of the current Senate Standing Committee onLegal and Constitutional Affairs Inquiry hearing is limited tothe Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill 1994,we must be ever mindful of ensuring that appropriate levels ofaccountability are provided in legislation granting and regulatingAFP powers. No matter how appropriate the mechanisms providedfor the investigations of complaints against the AFP might be,little satisfaction will be gained for complainants if the horsehas already bolted. The best outcome for the AFP and the Australiancommunity is for the cause of complaints to be eliminated whereverpossible. This is best assured by an independent and externalcomplaints authority complementing police powers granted in amanner designed to prevent abuse in the first instance. The National Association of Community Legal Centers submits thefollowing views in relation to the proposed amendments :- Clause 1 : Short Title RESPONSE: Nil... Clause 2 : Definitions RESPONSE: i-ii. Coverage of AFP staff members by the Complaints Act. The National Association does not object to the extension of thecomplaints regime to non-sworn staff members of the AFP. Howeverconsideration should be given to the different responsibilitiesentrusted to sworn and unsworn personnel. In disciplinary proceedings involving public servants generally,the evidence required to make out the complaint is on "thebalance of probabilities". If complaints against thesepublic servants are now to be assessed under the complaints mechanismfor sworn AFP members, it may be that the burden of proof nowrequired will be the criminal burden of "beyond reasonabledoubt". If this is the case, then it will effectively representa decrease in the level of accountability to the public of thesepublic servants. Clause 3 : Conciliation RESPONSE: i. Protection of evidence obtained in conciliation proceedings It is considered appropriate for matters raised in a conciliationsession to remain confidential as is the case in many other settings. It is generally accepted that confidentiality is essentialif conciliation proceedings are to be effective. ii. Discretion not to use Senior Members as Conciliators While the second amendment to Section 6B is intended to reflectchanges in the AFP service structure (i.e., consolidation of theAFP rank structure), a more fundamental issue relates to the appropriateprocesses to be used in conciliation and the perceived independenceof conciliators (that is independent of the AFP). It is fundamental that in any conciliation process there mustbe no power imbalance between the parties. The independence ofthe conciliator in this regard is essential. It is crucial that AFP personnel not act as conciliators in relation to complaintsagainst (the proposed) AFP appointees and Federal Police officers,as that would undermine public confidence in the conciliationprocess. It is appropriate to monitor the operation of the conciliationprocess. A "monitoring and evaluation" strategy shouldbe implemented to report on "process and outcome". Thismust entail assessing the views of complainants and AFP personnel.The findings should be assessed and made public by way of anannual report. Clause 4 Action Consequential on Report RESPONSE: It is the view of the National Association that these decisionsought not be made by the Commissioner. If the Commissioner isto continue in the role of determining whether charges shouldor should not be laid, it is most appropriate for the Commissionernot only to "consider" but to incorporate the viewsof the "independent" Ombudsman. Our preferred position would be for the Director of Public Prosecutionsto make the decision whether to lay criminal charges, upon referralfrom the appropriate independent complaints authority. Decisionsto proceed on disciplinary charges, or to offer a caution or admonition,should be made by the independent complaints authority, in consultationwith the Commissioner if appropriate. Clause 5 : Transfers to investigation Division Section 16. This section relates to the transfer of "Federal Police Officers"to the Internal Investigations Division. It also allows an officerto perform duties that are not related to the Divisions functionsif the Commissioner so directs, and provided the performance ofthose duties don't unduly interfere with the performance of theDivision. RESPONSE: Internal Investigations Divisions which are solely or largelycomprised of police officers are often likened to "Caesarinvestigating Caesar". The active promotion of an "InternalInvestigations Department" which continues to be comprisedsolely of police members will continue to come under public criticism. The opportunity should be taken to restructure any AFP ComplaintsMechanism to utilise the skills of civilian as well as policeinvestigators "when required". The establishment ofan independent Authority or "Commission" if properlyestablished could provide a national model for the states. The proposed and continued policy of police investigating policeis not considered to be a viable long term proposition if forno other reason than the continuing criticism, lack of faith andperceived lack of impartiality that such a system has attracted. Research undertaken in Victoria indicates that the public aremost reticent to report complaints against police to other police. (see attached) Even with the Ombudsman having power to undertake his/her owninvestigations the dual system still is not optimal as it stillhas police involvement in police investigating police. Practical experience of police Internal Investigation Departmentscompels the National Association to support the position takenby the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Recommendation226 calling for a review of police complaints proceduresin all Australian Jurisdictions and the adoption of "independentexternal investigation and adjudication of all complaints againstpolice", whether or not made by Aboriginals. The proposed amendment contained in the new subsection (3) islikely to blur the boundaries between the Internal InvestigationsDivision and the AFP proper even further with a consequent decreasein public confidence in the complaints process. The proposed new subsections (4) & (5) whilst logical withinthe context of internal investigations merely serve to highlightthe fundamental problem associated with those investigations. Clause 6 : False Complaints and Providing falseinformation in relation to Complaints i. Making false statements or giving false informationabout action taken by an AFP appointee. RESPONSE: It is the view of the National Association that no evidence isprovided to support the assertion that there is significant, oreven slight, abuse of the complaints procedures by complainants. The over riding experience of CLC's is that members of the publicare generally reluctant and frightened to lodge complaints againstpolice officers. They correctly perceive that they are at a significantdisadvantage whilst the complaints mechanism is effectively controlledby the organisation about whose member(s) they wish to complain. It is accepted among barristers and solicitors practicing in thecriminal law in Victoria to advise their clients not to raisecomplaints about police misconduct prior to the completion ofany charges facing them. This position has been informally adoptedby the profession in Victoria because too often clients have additionalcharges laid after lodging complaints against police officers. It is all too common to observe internal investigations staffproviding information to the prosecution at court and in someinstances internal investigation staff have directed prosecutorsnot to withdraw charges against clients. This amendment is opposed on the basis that it increases the opportunityfor additional pressure to be applied by unscrupulous AFP appointeeson persons wishing to register genuine complaints against an AFPappointee. ii. Whereby anyone who threatens or harms another personbecause of that persons involvement or someone else's involvementin an investigation under the Act can be prosecuted for victimization. RESPONSE: This clause is strongly supported. The CLC experience indicatesthat complainants against police fear, and are actually subjectedto victimization, as a result of taking action to pursue theircomplaint. Clause 7 : Investigation initiated by the Ombudsmanof there own motion. RESPONSE: This amendment is strongly supported on the basis that from timeto time the Ombudsman will become aware of matters which wouldjustify a complaint but which has not been the subject of one.The Ombudsman currently has no power to initiate an investigationunless a complaint has been made. The amendment thus allows ownmotion investigations under the Complaints Act . In addition the Ombudsman role should encompass a proactive publicinterest type approach which is able to actively pursue mattersof community concern related to the function and role of the AFP.Such a proactive approach should focus not only on specific issueareas but also on broad systemic areas as well. Full reports ofsuch investigations should be publicly available and details shouldalso be specified in the Annual report. Adequate funding and resourcing of the Ombudsman's Office mustbe provided in order that it is able to properly carry out itsduties. Accountability mechanisms for the exercise of highlyintrusive police powers, made ineffective by inadequate resources,are viewed cynically by the Australian public. Clause 8 : Duties of Ombudsman with respectto Complaints RESPONSE: Within the context of the proposed amendments this provision issupported to avoid duplication of effort in relation to simultaneousinvestigations. Clause 9 : Ombudsman may determine that complaintshould not be investigated RESPONSE: Although it would be generally supported that the Ombudsman shouldhave the discretion to determine that in certain circumstancesa complaint should not be investigated, or investigated furtherbecause of frivolity, vexatiousness, bad faith and trivialityscope should nevertheless exist to draw conclusions from suchlow level seemingly disparate and meaningless complaints. Although rudeness, bad language, abruptness and the like may appeartrivial such matters could in fact raise issue about broader systemicissues ranging from the adequacy of training to the nature andextent of supervision in the field. The nature and extent of theseseemingly frivolous matters should be adequately reported. Discriminationon the grounds of gender, race, ethnicity, culture, religion,disability, sexual preference or age is often reflected in such"frivolous or trivial" treatment. The failure to identifyand act on such complaints will lead to the development of a policeculture which accepts these forms of discrimination. Clause 10 : Special or additional Investigationsconducted by Ombudsman under this part. RESPONSE: We reiterate the comments made above with respect to Clause 4regarding the roles of the DPP, Ombudsman and the Commissioner. Recommendations for broader action by the ombudsman to the Commissionerand Minister are strongly supported. Clause 11: Power to obtain information and documents RESPONSE: It is inappropriate that the Ombudsman as investigator of lastresort has been restricted in the admissibility of evidence obtainedin the course of their investigation. The suggested amendment allowing the admissibility of evidenceis strongly supported. Clause 12: Persons affected to be informed ofresults of investigation by Ombudsman RESPONSE: The proposed amendment requiring the Ombudsman, on completionof an investigation to furnish to the Commissioner and the complainantparticulars of the result of the investigation is supported withthe suggestion that consideration should also be given to theuse of regular progress reports. (see Clause 14) Clause 13: Ombudsman to inform complainant ofresults of investigation RESPONSE: Agree that Ombudsman inform complainant of results of investigationundertaken by the Investigations division. Clause 14: Progress reports about complaints RESPONSE: It would be most appropriate that a progress report be providedto complainants at regular intervals i.e., 3 monthly. This shouldoccur whether the investigation is being undertaken by the Ombudsmanor the Investigation Division. If an investigation extends beyondsix months additional resources should be allocated in order toexpedite the matter. Investigations which go for years are an affront not only to thecomplainant and the accused but to the system of justice as well. In addition, it is suggested that simple and comprehensible explanationsof the status of a person's complaint should be provided. Furthermore, the opportunity should exist for the complainantto make comment on their perception of their treatment by therespective complaints system. (i.e., exit poll) Complainants viewsregarding the process and outcome should be "monitored andevaluated" in order to address any deficiencies in the Complaintsmechanisms. Clause 15: Reports of Special Inquiries RESPONSE: The recommendations that reports from inquiry's and person's appointedby the Minister should go to both the Minister and the Ombudsmanis strongly supported with the additional recommendation thatsuch reports should become publicly available in ordinary circumstancesand not remain secret. The only exception to the public availabilityof such reports may occur when prosecution is recommended in whichcase the report should be available after the prosecution. These final amendments focus on the procedure for hearingof minor disciplinary charges to which the officer charged pleadsguilty. Clause 16: New Part VA - Undisputed Charges The proposed amendment allows for such cases to be dealt withby the Commissioner, where the ombudsman agrees instead of thetribunal. It is considered that this design will eliminate unnecessary delaysunder the procedure of providing guarantees that the procedureadopted does not improperly protect the police. Furthermore thematter can be referred to the tribunal for penalty by the Commissionerif the ombudsman agrees. RESPONSE: The participation of the Commissioner in the disciplinary processis not supported particularly so as to remove any appearance ofbias. If this preferred position is not adopted then at least the typesof charges in which the Commissioner may lay disciplinary chargesshould at least be limited. Certain determined charges could gobefore the Commissioner and the rest whether the member is pleadingguilty or not go before the tribunal. In any event the nature and extent of these types of matters shouldbe "monitored and evaluated" and detailed research findingsbe made public. New Section 52A - Undisputed Charges in Respect of Breachof Discipline RESPONSE: Pursuant to the preceding Clause referring to Part VA - We areof the view that it is inappropriate that the Commissioner decidewhether the public interest requires proceedings to be dealt withby the Disciplinary tribunal. The Commissioner has a clear conflict of interest between publicconfidence which requires retention of public confidence in theAFP, and the public interest which requires breaches of disciplineto be dealt with appropriately. The above places the Commissioner in a difficult quandary andone in which the Commissioner should not be placed in. Decision making in this area would be better served if delegatedto the DPP or Ombudsman. New Section 52B - Commissioner may Impose Penalty RESPONSE: It is most important that the person being disciplined shouldalways be provided with the opportunity to provide some sort ofwritten submission in response to the penalty being applied. New section 52C - Ombudsman to be notified of penalty RESPONSE: Agree New section 52D - Ombudsman may inform Attorney Generalof penalty and New section 52E - Appeals RESPONSE: The intention of these amendments is allow an appeal against aninadequate penalty imposed by a Commissioner. We note that an Ombudsman who considers a penalty to be inadequateonly has a discretion to report in writing with comments to theAttorney General and the Attorney General only has a discretionto decide to appeal against the Commissioner's decision. In viewof the that the Commissioner is a member of the AFP who is actuallyimposing the penalty and that matters would have been largelydealt with internally and not independently, the Ombudsman shouldhave a direct right of appeal rather than relying on the AttorneyGeneral. Alternatively, this power could be delegated by the Ombudsmanto the DPP for appeal against the penalty. Clause 17: Charges in respect of Breaches ofdiscipline RESPONSE: In keeping with the principal of external review it is consideredinappropriate that the complaints process should rely on advicegiven by bodies or persons (i.e., Commissioner) which have aninterest in the procedural aspects as well as the outcome of theinvestigation. Furthermore the issue of how complaints are started or indeedhow they should be best allocated between the Ombudsman or theInvestigations Division is a vexed issue. Consideration should be given as to the point or indeed when isit appropriate that complaints should be referred to each other.How this should occur, and when, is an issue which requires furtherclarification. Clause 18: Powers of Tribunal RESPONSE: We agree that the Tribunal should have the power to have summonedbefore it persons or evidence relevant to particular proceedings. Clause 19 : Offense of Victimization RESPONSE: This amendment to the Act is considered to be of vital importanceas it is probably the single most important protection given topeople who make complaints against the police. Clause 20: Transitional Provision RESPONSE: Nil Clause 21: Other Amendments to extend applicationof Complaints (Australian Federal Police) RESPONSE: Nil Clause 22: Other Amendments to introduce Gender-neutralterminology in the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act1981 RESPONSE: General agreement with this clause Clause 23: Other Amendments to penalties RESPONSE: Nil Fitzroy Legal Service Home page E-mail Disclaimer Publications Catalogue Last update: WT03-B23-109IA038-000729-B033-295http://www.fitzroy-legal.org.au:80/ctyrepts/thrillsp.htm 203.15.70.193 19970210045344 text/html 22342HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Mon, 10 Feb 1997 04:53:51 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 22170Last-modified: Fri, 28 Jun 1996 01:39:41 GMT Fitzroy Legal Service: Community Reports Thrills and Spills - A Reporton Police High Speed Pursuits and Public Safety (Federation ofCommunity Legal Centres (Vic)) December 1991 The Federation of Community Legal Centres Victoria P.O.

Police Officer, Police Life (May1989) INTRODUCTION The increasingly frequent reports of injuriesand deaths arising from police high speed car chases is a graveconcern for the Victorian public. Police accident records reveal there have been194 pursuit mode collisions involving police vehicles in Victoriafrom 30 June 1990 to date, resulting in 31 civilian and 20 policeinjuries and three civilian deaths. This means that there are an average of almosttwo pursuit collisions per week. It is not only the police and suspects whoare endangered, but any road user may be put at unjustifiablerisk. This was illustrated by the deaths of two innocent victimswho happened to find themselves in the middle of a police "hotpursuit" earlier this year. Existing Victoria police policy relating tohigh speed pursuits states that: " All high speed driving, including policepursuits is extremely dangerous. High speed pursuits of trafficand minor crime offenders is rarely, if ever warranted."(Force Circular Memo 88-5-7) Unfortunately police practice appears to disregardthis policy guideline. When the chase of a stolen vehicle on 10 Aprillast year involving nine police cars, at speeds reaching 180 kms,resulted in a collision which put three people in hospital, thethen Assistant Commissioner (Operations), Mr Gavin Brown, wasreported as saying that police would follow exactly the same proceduresif they found themselves in the same situation in the future (TheSun April 11 1990). In apparent disregard for the seriousness ofthe injuries, the Assistant Commissioner also rejected calls thatthe pursuit posed an unjustifiable danger, saying car theft wasa serious offence. Had the police thought logically and followedtheir own advice to motorists, that "speed kills", itwould be clear to them that their chase tactics would lead tothe death of motorists. On 24 February 1991 a Divisional police vanengaged in a pursuit collided with a taxi in Dandenong killingthe 22 year old driver and one of the passengers aged 24. Thetaxi was not directly involved in the chase (Sunday Age April15 1990). As a result of this incident the Police Ministerfinally announced that there would be a review of police car chaseprocedures. Consequently an internal police review is being undertaken. This internal police review has not soughtcommunity consultation and it remains doubtful that the reviewwill address wider community concerns about the validity of highspeed chases (The Age 25 February 1991). Having again recognised that this is an arearequiring attention, the police should welcome external inputand withstand constructive criticism. The police are clearly protective of theirown authority which, it would seem, they view as more importantthan public safety. It is unfortunate that it takes a serious collisionresulting in fatality to prompt an investigation. It is even moreunfortunate when the investigation does not tackle the difficultquestions, inevitably leading to future fatalities and reviews. In the two week period between April 24 andMay 5 1978, five civilians were killed and another five injuredin three separate police car chases in Victoria (The Age 24 April1978, 26 April 1978, 5 May 1978). Four of the five killed were innocent bystandersembroiled in the pursuit. A review of police road rules occurred at thistime and changes were made to the procedures for emergency vehiclesunder the Road Safety Act. However, it appears that little has been doneto question the validity of pursuits per se. Until this is donethe cycle will continue. POLICE PRACTICE WHO PURSUES? Young male police in particular become morereadily consumed with the thrill of pursuing and testing theirdriving skills. Police describe much of the routine patrolwork as mundane. A car chase offers the opportunity to proveability and to call on high speed driving skills introduced intraining. Reflecting on his earlier year with the Force,a New South Wales Police Officer in an article in Police Life(May 1989) likened the pursuit to... " a `Clint Eastwood' showdown. Yourcompetence as a police officer seemed to rely solely on how quicklyyou could catch the offending vehicle or how you manoeuvred aroundobstacles such as red lights, traffic islands and footpaths athigh speed. Even if he got away it was top fun tryingto catch him. It was a great feeling that lasted for days withadrenalin surging, and which I welcomed with open arms every timeit happened. Then when it was all over and somehow throughgood luck rather than good management, you have survived, youcould return to the office feeling absolutely fantastic." The age of the officer/driver is importantnot only in light of the discretion they are required to exercisebut also because the general road statistics reveal that youngmale drivers are overrepresented in road deaths and injuries. Vic Road statistics for 1990 show that almost40% of male drivers killed or seriously injured in 1990 were malesin the 17 - 25 age group. The federal Office of Road Safety has foundthat people aged 17 - 25 account for 33% of road deaths in Australia,although they make up only 14.5% of the population. DRIVER TRAINING Driver training for police, recruited at 18years of age, currently consists of a two week (10 day) drivingcourse comprising several days lectures, some low speed drivingat the Attwood driving track and skid pan, several days drivingin the suburbs, and one day at Calder raceway doing mock pursuitsand learning evasive action skills. This practical training actuallyencourages use of high speed. At present there are three driving levels availabledepending on the activities of the particular officer: A - Motor cycle B - High speed Traffic Operations Group (TOG)pursuit vehicle C - At this level the officer can rely onthe emergency vehicle exemptions of the Road Safety Act and canchase in any vehicle except the TOG cars. It was reported in the September edition ofthe Police Association Journal that police personnel are advocatingthat all drivers be brought up to the B level. This means thatall officers will be able to drive high speed TOG vehicles. This again reflects the emphasis on encouragingpolice to engage in "hot pursuits", as opposed to curbingsuch behaviour in the public interest. It is interesting to note that the intake agefor ambulance drivers is 21 - 35 years. The driver training forambulance officers occurs over a period of approximately sevenweeks. After this, the trainees go out in cars but are under clinicalsupervision with an accompanying senior officer. In their second year they receive further trainingand become fully qualified officers at the end of their thirdyear. Ambulance officers do not have to make decisionsabout whether a high speed run is warranted. All attendances aretheoretically to a life threatening situation and the AmbulanceBrigade takes part in at least three times as many high speedruns as any other emergency service. WHO IS BEING PURSUED AND WHY? As there are no official police statisticsrelating to this we cannot be precise. However, it is evidentfrom media reporting that the police are often chasing young malesfor minor offences such as traffic and theft. When inexperienced drivers seek to evade police,the situation invariably becomes even more dangerous with thehigh risk of them losing control of the vehicle. The crucial questions which need to be addressedare whether death or serious injury are appropriate penaltiesfor these young offenders and whether the community should beput at further risk to apprehend them. On 22 August 1990 police chased a 15 year oldyouth in a stolen car along the Hume Highway at speeds up to 140kph. In attempting to avoid a police road blockthe youth drove over the median strip and on the wrong side ofthe highway. A sergeant at the scene was reported as sayingthat in his estimation the youth missed a head on collision bya mere two seconds (The Sun August 23 1990). The youth was charged with theft and trafficoffences for which the pursuit almost resulted in death to theoffender and innocent road users. Engaging in high speed pursuits for allegedminor offences is simply unjustifiable given the potential dangerto the public. Official police policy recognises this but policepractice does not. The Assistant Police Commissioner's commentsmade in April last year stating that car theft is a serious offencejustifying dangerous pursuit is of grave concern. Many suspected car theft or traffic offenderswho are pursued are also charged with more serious offences suchas recklessly endangering life as a result of the pursuit. Surelythe police should not be prompting the more serious charge ofrisking life to apprehend for the lesser charges. On 30 November 1991 an 18 year old car thiefslammed into the back of another vehicle injuring the driver andhis baby son. This was after a two hour high speed pursuit throughAlbury (Herald Sun 3 December 1991). Two innocent lives were yet again almost lost. CAN "HOT PURSUITS" BE JUSTIFIED? The police argue that they must be allowedto engage in high speed pursuits to fulfil their sworn responsibilityto "keep and preserve the peace and to prevent to the bestof their power all offences against same" [Acting Inspec.Neil O'Sullivan 12 April 1991]. Police state that if their right of pursitis jettisoned it would be an open invitation to any car thief,armed robber or other offender to simply speed away. They maintain that the frequency of accidentsis few compared to the number of kilometres travelled and alsothat it must be at the discretion of the individual officer inall of the existing circumstances as to whether the chase is warranted. Again this reflects a defensive attitude whichmakes no progress toward ensuring that fatal collisions do notoccur. These arguments have more to do with the police wantingto defend their own autonomy than with their formal responsibilitiesfor the public welfare. Available statistics indicate that there were84 collisions during pursuit for the twelve month ending 30 June1989 and 74 to 26 May 1990. As before mentioned the current statisticsindicate 194 pursuit collisions from June 1990 to date with 31civilian and 20 police injuries and 3 civilian deaths. Given thehighly dangerous nature of pursuits this is an alarming number. However the community concern about policecar chases relates not only to statistics, but to the issue ofwhether chasing is an appropriate response in many situations,and whether they should be allowed to continue as an acceptedmeans of apprehending offenders. The Police Association argue that in most casesthe police officer will not know for what offence he/she is pursuinguntil the chase is over and that hindsight can be the best andonly management tool. Hindsight however can never justify the deathof two totally innocent road users as occurred in Dandenong thisyear, particularly when there are alternative routes to arrest. The police view does not take into accountthat the pursuit in most circumstances will make an already dangeroussituation worse. A person being chased is prone to panic and invariablywill accelerate or drive more dangerously to escape. Further it takes little account of generalpublic welfare and again gives unquestioned discretion to generallyyoung officers who may lack the experience to make a considereddecision. Police readiness to chase in these instancesis indicative of the priority they give to property offences asopposed to violence against the person. Police statistics and groups working with victimsof domestic violence testify to the fact that police are reluctantto take out Intervention Orders or to charge offenders with assaultor for breaching an order. In fact, statistics indicate thatpolice fail to take any action against offenders in more than87% of the family violence incidents they attend. Yet it appears that police will go to extraordinarylengths to apprehend young people for relatively minor offenceswhile at the same time subjecting the community to extreme danger. What does this say about police priorities? PUTTING PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST Training The Victoria Police will undoubtedly promoteincreased driver training standards. However, the more fundamentalquestions about pursuits are being ignored. It is arguable that increased driver trainingwill only result in more unnecessary and dangerous pursuits. Any improved training of officers must includestrict directions as to the dangers of high speed pursuit anda general premise about the absolute priority of public safety. This should emphasise the use of alternativestrategies to apprehend those driving stolen vehicles. Police officers have an overriding discretionas to whether the circumstances warrant a pursuit. For this reasontheir training should be far more comprehensive and should indeedfocus on this issue. It is a decision which must be exercisedby a mature and calm mind. The intake age for police officersis therefore cause for serious concern. It is interesting to note the results of aUnited States study examining young driver training and safety. Despite the level of training provided to a group of 18,000 students[the students were categorised as having recieved "ordinary","advanced" or " super" training] the studyconcluded after a two year period that there was no differencein accident rates between the groups.[Prof. McDermott, Chairman,Road Trauma Committee, Royal Australasian College of Surgeons] The Federation of Community Legal Centres believesthat increased or improved practical driver training skillswould be unlikely to result in significantly less or safer pursuits. Accountability The police must be accountable to the communityfor all aspects of their work and in particular for the resultsof high speed pursuits where public safety is at risk. The Victoria Police keep limited statisticsdetailing the costs to the community of police pursuits. The statisticsthat are available show only the numbers of police and civilianskilled or injured as a result of a collision. There is no information collated to show: -civilians killed or injured who were passengersin the pursued vehicle - persons killed or injured who were not involvedin the pursuit - the ages of those killed or injured - the age of the driver of the police vehicle - the alleged offences for which the policewere pursuing - the cost of repairing vehicles involvedin such collisions The statistics that are available are not reliable. Assistant Commissioner (Traffic and Operations Support) advisedon 6 June 1990 that for the twelve month period ending 30 June1989 there were 84 collisions during pursuit of offenders withno fatalities but injuries to 16 police and 15 civilians. Yet, on 30 March 1989 it was reported thata man driving a stolen car died instantly in a collision duringa high speed police chase on the Calder Highway (The Age 30 March1989). For the public to be fully informed about policepursuits the Federation of Community Legal Centres believes thatdetailed and accurate information must be kept and publicisedannually. Overseas and Interstate Alternatives In the United States there have been significantchanges with regard to high speed pursuit. President of the New York Police Foundation,Patrick Murphy, recently stated that "police in the United States don't pursuevery much. Some departments take pride in the fact that they havevery few pursuits. They won't pursue beyond 35 miles per hour.The reason for that is that so many motorists have been killed......Morepolice officers are killed in pursuits than by gunfire in theUnited States." [Evidence to the Police Shooting Inquest,4 Sept 1991] With such a high density population in theUnited States, pursuits in any town or built up area are extremelyhazardous. It is not surprising then, that pursuits are beingdowngraded. South Australian procedures relating to carchases are quite detailed and stipulate that car chases are onlyjustified in the following circumstances: - emergencies involving obvious danger tohuman life - detection of very serious crime It goes on to say that traffic breaches andillegal use are summary offences and by themselves do not constituteserious crime. (General Duties Manual Feb 1988 para 4.2 ) The Manual also outlines comprehensive instructionsin para 4.3.2 entitled "Considerations for Institution andContinuation of Pursuit " and directs officers to take intoaccount the seriousness of the offence, the need for immediateapprehension, availability of other assistance, climatic conditions,and police driver competence. It provides that a pursuit is to be terminatedwhen necessity of immediate apprehension is outweighed by dangersof continuing and when the identity of the driver/ occupants isknown, enabling apprehension to occur later. In Tasmania police road blocks are banned andstanding orders direct that officers can pursue up to such speedas is considered dangerous and then must pull out. Current N.S.W. guidelines are similar to Victoria. However in 1985 an inquiry was referred to the Joint StandingCommittee on Road Safety of the N.S.W. parliament (the StaysafeCommittee). The recommendations of the committee included: - that the police make more use of moderntechnology in cases of pursuit, for example utilising police helicoptersin cases of extended pursuits -that there be established a Vehicle PursuitReview Panel to inquire into every injury to either a police officer,a suspected offender or an innocent bystander following a policepursuit vehicle -that the reports of the panel should be madepublic and also tabled in Parliament -that police move to upgrade the trainingof police drivers in appropriate attitudes and strategic decisionmaking. These recommendations unfortunately have notbeen implemented. Conclusion The internal police review of policy and practicewith regard to high speed pursuits in Victoria has not soughtpublic comment. Since these issues are so pertinent to publicsafety, the Federation of Community Legal Centres urges the Ministerfor Police and Emergency Services, Mal Sandon and the Police Commissioner,Kel Glare, to ensure that the public is given adequate opportunityto comment on any recommendations that may stem from the review. It is to be hoped that the review is a progressiveone and comprehensively addresses the issues at hand.

Inference as to the degree of supportor otherwise as offered by the Fitzroy Legal Service as an organizationor its staff or volunteers should not be drawn. On the 27th July, a seminar was held on the Crimes CompensationTribunal( CCT) at the Legal Aid Lawyer's Conference held at theLegal Aid Commission. The talk was given by Felicity Broughton,a solicitor with the firm of Howie & Maher with a wealth ofexperience in the CCT jurisdiction. In light of the Federation'srecent concern as to the manner in which applications are beingdealt with by the Tribunal, and in view of recent changes to thePractice Rules, it seemed appropriate to update practitionerson the contents of the talk and some other issues that have cometo the author's attention. The Chief Magistrate of the CCT, Ann McDonald has produced a leafletentitled' Crimes Compensation Tribunal- The Questions Most Asked'(phone9628 7855 for a copy) which goes briefly through the provisionsand their application. The reality is that the interpretationof the legislation will often depend on the personal style andthe idiosyncrasy's of the presiding Magistrate. In recent times,there has been a shift from specialist tribunals (e.g. SexualAssault cases at Prahran and Melbourne) to the regionalising oftribunals dealing with such cases. Venue Applications must be heard at the Tribunal nearest to the applicant.There are exceptions where there are multiple applicants. Thenthe case is heard closest to the scene of the crime. A requestcan be made to have an alternative venue, if for example, youare in the country and concerned about privacy and the smallnessof the community. Time The CCT is treating extensions of time seriously in relation tosexual assault cases but the general rule is that the applicationmust be made 12 months from the date of injury. Where there isa delayed injury claim (e.g. psychological injury) the tribunalmust make a distinction between the date of the crime and thedate of the delayed injury. It is wise to lodge a claim as soonas possible and present as much evidence in support of the delayedinjury as possible at this time in order to get the extension. Police Brief The use of the police brief is contentious as it is often prejudicial.Since 1993 police material may have a note that 'materials maybe released' however, there are several exceptions including wherethere is no notation on the brief or where they are subject toIID inquiry. The CCT suggests direct FOI applications are thebest way to proceed as they avoid compromising situations forthe CCT. Calling The Alleged Offender Section 7(7) enables the CCT to notify the offender. This a particularlyconcerning issue where sexual assault is involved. Practitionerswill not generally get an opportunity to argue that the sectionshould not be invoked. Perhaps a submission that the alleged offendernot be notified should be made at the outset can be made in writinghowever chances of success are limited. Practitioners should bemindful of using the witness protection system in such cases.A further note of warning is that if an offender appears theymay have access to police files through FOI you should do thesame prior to hearing so there are no surprises. Note in someinstances solicitors have been refused access to the police briefby the CCT. The question as to the alleged offenders right to cross examinethe applicant is still open. Proving Injury For many years CASA reports as to injury have been acceptablethis no longer appears to be the case. It may be that a psychologist'sreport establishing "illness' or 'disorder' is advisable.The diagnosis of injury must be made by someone with proven credentialand come within the terms of DSM4. The position in relation tothe diagnosis of a child's injury is unclear as DSM doesn't havecategories for children. Generally, solicitors try to minimizechild contact with psychiatrists as it can exacerbate the traumaof the injury. The best option for practitioners may be to seekother materials to support the existence of injury and hope forthe best.

It is a tragedy for all Victorians that the current push by theKennett Government, the Victoria Police, and the Police Associationfor increased police powers has failed to consider issues of policeaccountability and responsibility. Our world is full of examples of the disastrous effects of theexcesses of governments and their enforcement agencies on individualcitizens, classes of citizens and whole societies. Yet we arebeing asked to blindly accept, by those bodies who have the greatestto gain from the increased powers proposed, that what they proposefor their own interests is for our benefit. The fact that our society is based upon a political system withthe fundamental precept that government is to be accountable tothe community, and not that the community must account to itspolitical representatives and their appointees, seems to havebeen forgotten. It is equally true that individuals in our society must be heldaccountable for their actions, although it would seem that themost powerful in our community are able to avoid the accountabilityrequired of the less powerful. This reality does not seem to havetroubled the minds of those hell bent on achieving their politicalagenda of increased police powers. Where individuals are required to account to the rest of the communityfor their actions through the governments' investigative and enforcementagencies, special care needs to be taken to balance the fundamentalrights of the individual against their duty to be accountablefor their alleged actions. To help achieve this balance of fundamental rights and accountability,our society have given special privileges and powers to policeand other enforcement agencies. All of us are entitled, and infact duty bound to all other citizens, to demand proper accountabilityfor the exercise of the these special privileges and powers bythe government and the police. Police officers openly lobbying for increased powers is dangerousand obnoxious to the concept of accountability. Those who areto benefit from the granting of the extra-ordinary powers beingproposed are abusing their position of trust and privilege byopenly engaging in an exercise of political pressure and mediagrand standing. The police, as public servants, should make theirsubmissions to their Minister in the appropriate manner. What new privileges and powers are being proposed for this specialgroup? Does the Kennett Government propose to engage the communityin debate about the privileges and powers they intend to giveaway on our behalf? What standards of accountability are to be demanded of those whoare given these privileges and powers? What can the communityexpect when these privileges and powers are abused? What stepsare being taken to minimise the risk of the abuse of privilegeand power granted? What steps are being taken to prevent the evertoo familiar cover up of these abuses when they happen? These questions demand answers but few are being provided. It is understood that privileges and powers in relation to providingname and address, strip searches and finger prints and other bodysamples are among those sort and likely to be granted. How wellthey reflect the balance required between fundamental rights andaccountability, and how those who will be granted them are tobe accountable is apparently too frightening to debate. The notion that police will have the power, enforceable by thecriminal law, to demand a name and address of any one on the street,is both frightening and bizarre. This truly is an example of thecitizen being made arbitrarily accountable to the government.Such a power is the essence of a repressive, dictatorial society. Within the framework of privileges and powers granted by the restof the community to the police, the appropriate law is one whichrequires the police to provide details of their rank, name, stationand reason for intervening in the citizens life. Such a law mustbe accompanied by an appropriate criminal penalty for failureto comply with the citizens request, with the onus of proof restingon the person entrusted with the privilege and the power. Any notion that police should have the power to demand name andaddress in the manner envisaged is a nonsense. Any person arrestedand charged with a crime cannot be released under current lawswithout providing, and if requested, verifying name and address.Where there is insufficient "reasonable belief" to justifythe arrest of a citizen then there is absolutely no grounds fora power to demand name and address. The Australia Card was stridently opposed by the community, whyshould we now surrender such power to the police? Greater protection,perhaps by way of a Bill of Rights, must be afforded to our democraticand human rights. Under existing Victorian law, police are entitled to request fingerprints of persons suspected of committing a crime. This is doneas a matter of routine. Where the citizen refuses to provide consentto the taking of finger prints then police must account to anindependent authority, in the form of a Magistrate, before theycan use force to take the finger prints. If after considering the material put by police and the guidelinesprovided in the Crimes Act, the Magistrate believes that it isappropriate for the finger prints to be taken, then the policemay use force to obtain them. Under this system of accountability police have been able to obtainaround 30,000 finger prints per year. This approach provides an appropriate balance between the accountabilityand rights of the citizen, and the accountability of the personour society has seen fit to grant special privileges and powers. The taking of other body samples, with the exception of breathanalysis for the purpose of drink driving laws, are also currentlysubject to similar accountability provisions. Again, a sensibleand workable balance has been achieved in the interest of thewhole community, not just in the interest of those entrusted withthe special privileges and powers. Ordinary searches, strip searches and internal body searches arenot currently covered by laws which provide for proper external,independent accountability in Victoria. The failure of the previousLabour Government to address this area of accountability mustforever remain to their discredit. It is to be hoped that the current Liberal Government will ensurethat the most basic of human rights, the sanctity of ones ownbody, will be finally protected from the arbitrary, and thereforeobscene, abuse by police. No strip search or internal body searchshould be allowed in Victoria without the prior external and independentaccountability of the police to a Magistrate, whose decision issubject to judicial review. If our community requires anything less than that level of protectionand accountability then we are not serious about the protectionof community members. One of the most frightening privileges we have given to our policeis that of carrying arms. Police in Victoria carry firearms asa matter of course. This fact, coupled with the reality of internalreview of their use and misuse, and the refusal of police officersto answer questions at Coroners' inquests into citizens deathsat the end of a police gun, on the grounds that they might incriminatethemselves, strongly suggests that the accountability/privilegeequation is badly out of balance. As a community we must either demand that police hand back theirguns and provide prior accountability for any requests for theirissue, or insist on proper independent, external accountabilityfor their use. The current system amounts to the absolute worstform of accountability and its continuation is an unacceptableblight on our community. Allegations of excessive and deliberate use of violence by Victoria'spolice in police stations has been chronic for years. Nothinghas been done to effectively tackle this problem. Police privatelyadmit that the problem exists and that there is an unwritten codethat police will turn a blind eye and actively protect policewho engage in this violence. The establishment of an independent, trained community visitorsscheme, with powers to enter Victorian police stations unannounced,would go a long way towards achieving an appropriate balance betweenprivilege and accountability. Naturally sensible guidelines wouldneed to be established to ensure that police work was not unnecessarilyinterfered with, and to protect the rights of those in policecustody, including their right to confidentiality. Such a scheme would also serve to protect police from false accusationand provide support for them in relation to their working conditions. Independent assessment and evaluation of recruitment and selectioncriteria for Victoria's police is fundamental to the issue ofbalancing privileges, powers and accountability. Likewise thetraining of police should be subject to independent assessmentand evaluation. These and other issues, such as the external investigation ofcomplaints against police, must be addressed before our communityshould consider granting further privileges and powers to ourpolice. It is they who serve the community, not the communitywho serve them.

Rapid Reform To Psychiatric Services Leaves Little Room ForConstructive Criticism By Liz Curran - Article For "LIBERTY"The Victorian Council for Civil Liberties Magazine Liz Curran can be contacted at: The Federation of Community Legal Centres Victoria P.O. Box 1139K GPO Melbourne 3000 Victoria Australia Tel: 61 03 9602 4949 Fax: 61 03 9602 4948 On the 15th December,1995, Mr. Chris Sidoti, The Human RightsCommissioner released the "Report of the Reconvened Inquiryinto Human Rights of People with Mental Illness". This reconvenedinquiry was conducted by the former Human Rights Commissioner,Mr. Brian Burdekin in response to a large number of requests forhis inquiry to reconvene. Some of the grounds for reconveningin Victoria were that many care- givers within the mental healthsystem felt "intimidated", were "frightened tocomplain" or "might lose funding" and so had feltunable to comment at the earlier inquiry about the problems inherentin the rapid rate of reform in the Victorian Department of PsychiatricServices. In April 1994, the Victorian Government launched " Victoria'sMental Health Service: The Framework for Service Delivery"this contained a five year plan to redevelop and redistributemental health services in Victoria. The Human Rights Commissioner'sReport is critical of the approach of government whereby it isimplementing changes at such a rapid rate that the needs of mentalhealth consumers cannot be met. The Report highlights a numberof concerns which can be summarized as follows: 1. Clinical labels are attached to mental health consumers tothe exclusion of environmental factors. 2. The gaps caused by the rapid reforms are left unplugged causinggreat pressures for those with the mental illness, their carersand their families. 3. Resources are inadequate and carers are overworked. 4. Inadequacy of services for especially vulnerable or disadvantagedgroups including the homeless, the elderly and people with disabilities. 5. There is a lack of co-ordination between different servicesand different departments. 6. There is a lack of consultation between the government departmentsand non government agencies, consumers and carers. 7. Unqualified people are administering medication in non-specialistresidential facilities. 8. There is a climate of "intimidation" within the PsychiatricServices field. These are but some of the observations made in the report. Deinstitutionalisation is an International trend and fits in witha civil libertarian view that human beings have a right to freedomand liberty. The United Nation's "Principles for The Protectionof Persons with Mental Illness" are based on the principlesof the least restrictive alternative for treatment of mental healthconsumers. Deinstitutionalisation should not, however be an excusefor budget cuts or cost efficiency in an endeavor to balance agovernments books. Deinstitutionalisation can work provided thereis adequate resourcing, funding and enough qualified carers toassist and be on call. A commitment to long term care of mentalhealth consumers should be an intrinsic part of the philosophybehind Deinstitutionalisation. In Victoria, Deinstitutionalisationcannot work until the lives and treatment of the patients comebefore political ends. Given the rapid rate of reform in Victoria one would expect thegovernment to want feedback, positive or negative on how the policyis working and where the conflicts between the policy and itsimplementation lie. Instead, we see the stifling of such commentsby alleged threats of retaliation or reprisal. Such a climateof intimidation places significant restraint on fundamental democraticprinciples such as freedom of speech. Where the people in thefront line who care for, have experience and expertise with mentalhealth consumers are ignored, how can real reform eventuate. Itmust have taken great courage for those people who raised theirconcern to come forward and speak to the inquiry. Further, mental health consumers, their families, carers and communitylegal centres must now deal with the fallout from access to adequateservices being denied- the shooting by police of mentally illpersons, the suicides and attempted suicides of a large numberof mental health consumers. Afterwards, there is devastation causedto those left behind- the families who tried to cope and supportthe mentally ill person, the carers and psychiatrists who triedto help but failed because of the inadequacies of the system.My own discussions with parents of young persons who have suicided(after being unable to access psychiatric care) also underlinethe fact that there is no adequate nor easily decipherable complaintsmechanism within the Psychiatric Services Department where theycan express their concerns. Ms Tehan, the Health minister refers to increases in numbersof registered patients, money being put into treatment services,how her government spends more on mental health than any otherstate and how there are 65 beds around the state for psychiatricpatients on a given night. These comments however don't sit easilywith the reality. Psychiatrists claim that they have to ring aroundtheir friends to beg for beds(and state that they can't bear tothink who they are pushing out of a bed in the process). Thesepsychiatrists state that there may be 65 beds listed on the computerbut in reality they are either closed or awaiting a patient backfrom leave. There may be an increase in the number of registeredpatients but this says nothing about the quality and adequacyof care they are receiving. If the government is spending so muchmoney why are there so many problems with resources and accessto hospitals. The question is how is the money being spent- isit on economic consultants and management or is it being spenton direct service provision and care for patients? The government has done little to follow up on the recommendationsmade in the Human Rights Commissioner's Report. The governmentrather than addressing the concerns raised in the report merelystated that the believed the allegations of intimidation unlikely.It has still not addressed the other shortcoming in psychiatricservice delivery outlined in the Report. The government takesa "head in the sand" approach quoting statistics thatmean little in the context of the unnecessary loss of life anda number of acute crises likely to result from an inability toaccess long term care. It is a shame that human dignity, respect and quality care forthose with a mental illness has such a low priority in this state.

Box 1139K GPO Melbourne 3000 Victoria Australia Tel: 61 03 9602 4949 Fax: 61 03 9602 4948 Disclaimer:The Views Expressed in this paper may or may not be supportedby the Fitzroy Legal Service. Inference as to the degree of supportor otherwise as offered by the Fitzroy Legal Service as an organizationor its staff or volunteers should not be drawn. Preface In the main, the Federation of Community Legal Centres is opposedto police calls for additional powers in situations of domesticviolence. In the three years since the introduction of the Crimes (FamilyViolence) Act police have demonstrated a continued reluctanceto treat domestic violence as a serious crime and to initiateaction, appropriate to the crime, on behalf of victims. The Crimes (Family Violence) Act clearly intended thatthe police would take out the majority of intervention ordersto reduce financial and psychological pressure on the victim andto demonstrate in the strongest possible way, that the communitydoes not condone domestic violence. Of all orders taken out since proclamation of the Act in December1987, the percentage initiated by police has never exceeded 3.5%. Dec '87 - Feb '89 1.8% June 1989 3.4% Feb 1990 2% July 1990 3.5% (1) The reluctance of police to utilise criminal law remedies, theirfailure to use their existing powers of entry and arrest and tocharge perpetrators with assault has little to do with ambiguousor inadequate powers. As we have already noted, police also failto utilise the civil remedies available to them under the Crimes(Family Violence) Act. This reluctance to intervene at alllevels arises from their attitude toward domestic violence. Assault"in the home", unlike assault on the street, is a lowpriority and continues to be viewed as something apart from "real"violence and "real" police work. Workers in community legal centres hear numerous complaints fromvictims of domestic violence about police failure to attend andto act when they are in life threatening situations. At the otherend of the spectrum, community legal workers can point to numerousexamples where police are only too prepared to over-exercisetheir powers of arrest and charge, particularly against economicallydisadvantaged young people and particularly with respect to minoroffences (ie. drunk and disorderly, loiter etc)(2). Forced entry,without a warrant, for minor offences against property is alsocommon. Both extremes would indicate problems in the way police chooseto exercise their discretion within the framework of their availablepowers. It demonstrates to us a fundamental lack of understandingon the part of the police of the real nature of crime in our society,of its underlying structural causes and of its impact on women. Establishing clear guidelines for police performance and an independentmonitoring mechanism to evaluate police involvement would, inour view, be of greater assistance to victims of domestic violencein the long term. The introduction of a legal duty on policeto act should also be canvassed. Our specific comments on the recommendations put forward by thePolice Family Violence Project Office to amend the Crimes (FamilyViolence) Act follow. AUTHORITY TO ENTER PREMISES Police Recommendation 1. That the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 be amended soas to give police specific authority to enter premises where thereare reasonable grounds to investigate whether a family violenceincident has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur, orto prevent further violence. This recommendation is opposed. Existing police powers of entry, with or without a warrant, areextensive. Briefly, they are as follows : - without a warrant, if they are invited to do so by a personwho lives there. - without a warrant, under common law, if they have reasonablegrounds to believe that a breach of the peace is occurring oris about to occur. - without a warrant, under s459A of the Crimes Act, toarrest a person they believe on reasonable grounds has committedor is committing a serious indictable offence. - police may forcibly enter premises to execute a warrant toarrest. - under s18A of the Crimes (Family Violence) Act. It is difficult to think of situations which might arise wherethese powers are not sufficiently clear to enable police to lawfullyenter. The example often used by police, where they are calledto a property by a neighbour and, upon arrival, are denied entryby the perpetrator who assures them that all is well, is one inwhich police could lawfully enter under their common law powers. Had the neighbour reported suspected possession of stolen goodsor a marijuana plant in the back yard, the police would have nohesitation about entering. In the absence of any demonstration by police of their preparednessto actively assist women who are victims of domestic violence- via the rigorous application of civil and criminal law remediesin those instances, which we believe to be the majority of cases,where their powers are beyond question - support for additionalpowers can only be seriously questioned. AUTHORITY TO APPREHEND PERPETRATORS Police Recommendations 2. That the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 be amended so asto give police specific authority to take perpetrators into custodywhere there is a reasonable belief that the personal safety ofthe aggrieved family member is threatened or that damage is likelyto be caused to any property of the aggrieved family member unlessthe perpetrator is brought into custody. 3. That such amendments be additional to and not in substitutionof common law provisions. These recommendations are opposed. While the Federation agrees that arrest is often the most appropriateaction for police to take in situations involving domestic violenceand therefore supports the need for police to exercise their existingarrest powers more frequently in these situations, this is notwhat this recommendation is about. It would appear that whatpolice are seeking here is the power to apprehend and detain apotential offender without charging. Presently, police have the power to arrest with a warrant, andwithout a warrant (under s458 & 459 of the Crimes Act)in the following circumstances : - in the case of a summary offence, where a person is found committingthe offence where the apprehension of that person is necessaryfor (among other things) the preservation of public order, toprevent the continuation or repetition of the offence and/or forthe safety or welfare of members of the public. - where police believe on reasonable grounds a person is committingor has committed a serious indictable offence. While on the face of it this amendment is appealing in that itapparently offers victims an immediate form of protection, itis outrageous when we consider the reluctance of police to arrestperpetrators of domestic violence when an assault has takenplace! In our experience, police do not appear to believe that the lawsprohibiting assault within the Crimes Act should be appliedwhen dealing with persons in a personal relationship and thusrefuse to lay criminal charges, even where there is evidence ofan assault. When police attend domestic violence situations andthey discover evidence of other crimes they will often ignoreserious assault and investigate other crimes. We are concerned that such an extension of police powers setsa dangerous precedent and rides roughshod over one of our mostfundamental freedoms and civil liberties - that no person shouldbe held against his/her will without appearing before a court. This amendment implies that the person (perpetrator) will betaken into custody but not charged. Because no charge has beenlaid, the person would not be brought before a justice. This is clearly open to abuse. INTERIM INTERVENTION ORDERS Police Recommendations 4. That sections 8(1) and 8(2) of the Crimes (Family Violence)Act 1987 be amended by substituting the words "A Magistrateor Children's Court Magistrate or, in the event that it is notpracticable to obtain the services of a Magistrate or Children'sCourt Magistrate, the principal registrar or a deputy registrar"for the words "A court" where those words appear inthe sections. 5. That the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 be amended to allowthe principal registrar, registrar or deputy registrar to issueinterim intervention orders. 6. That the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 be amended to allowpolice to make applications by telephone for an interim interventionorder in circumstances where the application cannot feasibly bemade either in person to the Magistrate or to the principal registrar,registrar or deputy registrar. The Federation does not support those parts of the recommendationsthat would empower "..the principal registrar, a registraror a deputy registrar.." to issue interim intervention orders. The Federation supports the underlying aim of the proposal toimprove access to orders. However, we believe that by removingthis authority from Magistrates and delegating it to clerks/registrarsthe status of the orders, and indeed the abuse precipitating theorder, will be further watered down. Interim intervention orderswould potentially take on an administrative rather than legalstatus which, in the context of police and some community attitudesto domestic violence, would seriously erode the effectivenessof the Crimes (Family Violence) Act. Additionally, in our experience, the attitudes and responses ofclerks/registrars often preclude or discourage women from seekingan intervention order. Some examples of what women, seeking interimintervention orders, have encountered from the clerk of courtinclude disbelief in her situation and refusal to prepare an application;refusal to prepare an application unless the alleged perpetratoris present to tell his side of the story, or unless the womanhas already separated from the other party; being advised by clerksthat orders are not granted for emotional abuse and so on. Anextension of clerks powers would serve to reinforce attitudessuch as these that trivialise domestic violence and discreditwomen's experience. Twenty-four hour access to a Magistrate or Children's Court Magistrate(by phone if necessary) is a proposal we support. An arrangementthat allows victims to apply by phone for an interim interventionorder (to a Magistrate), recognising that the system would requiresome mechanism for screening, is also recommended. We recognise,however, the limitations of such an approach in according victimsimmediate protection. An interim intervention order still needsto be served on the defendant to be legally enforceable and inall likelihood service will not take place the same evening. Again, we stress that in many instances victims would be far betterserved if police were to exercise their power of arrest (s459Crimes Act) when immediate action is required. SERVICE OF INTERVENTION ORDERS Police Recommendation 7. That section 22 of the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 beamended by deleting the words "in accordance with section15" and inserting the words "in the opinion of the Court"after the word "has" where it appears a second timein that section. This amendment is opposed. The police proposal to amend S22 of the Crimes (Family Violence)Act does virtually nothing in our view to address the problemssurrounding service of an intervention order. In the experience of community legal centres, the problems inthis area largely stem from police failure to take serious stepsto effect service - again it appears it is seen as a low priority. Judy attended a community legal centre after being told bypolice they could not do anything because they did not witnessthe assault by her husband , Bill. Judy was severely bruised,blackened and had a lacerated face and eye. She obtained an interimintervention order with the assistance of the community legalworker but experienced problems in the service of the order. When approached by Judy, the police said they could not findthe defendant and told Judy "When you find out where he isring us and let us know". The police had Bill's work address. Judy subsequently found out Bill's new home address and informedthe police. Police took another three days to serve the order.(3) What this particular amendment achieves in practice is anothertransfer of power and authority from the Magistrate to the clerk/registrar. S15 of the Crimes (Family Violence) Act compels a Magistrateto explain to the defendant the purpose, terms and effect of theorder, the consequences that may follow for failure to complyand the means by which the order may be varied etc. Under theproposed amendment, this function could would, be performed bythe clerk substantially weakening its impact. This transfer suggests to the police and the offender that domesticviolence lacks sufficient import to warrant the attentions ofthe Magistrate. We reject this suggestion. In cases where the defendant is in court, the Magistrate shouldexplain the order and the defendant should receive a copyof the order incorporating the requirements under S15 (c), (d)and (e) before leaving the court. PORTABILITY OF INTERVENTION ORDERS Police Recommendation 8. That the Attorney-General enter into agreement with the Attorney-Generalof the Commonwealth and other States and Territories to pass legislationto allow orders which fall within the general definition of interventionorders made in a State or Territory to be registered in any otherState or Territory and be enforceable to the extent to which thoseorders are enforceable in the State or Territory in which theorder is registered. The Federation supports this amendment.

What Makes Tucker Anthony Different? Although Tucker Anthony is a full-service investment firm like thelarge national firms, it has stayed very close to its roots byremaining small and financially solid, with an emphasison addressing clients' needs. As a small, cohesive organization, Tucker Anthonyensures cost-control while maintaining its abilityto quickly and effectively adapt to changes in the market. Ourfinancial strength ensures that we will continue to meet yourinvestment needs not only during the good times, but during thebad times as well. What really sets Tucker Anthony apart fromits large competitors is how we service our customers. In the old days on Wall Street, brokers were called "customers'men." Their role was to serve their clients' needs,rather than to distribute products as they do today.We like to think that Tucker Anthony Investment Executives are"customers' people." Rather than have a clientfill out a computerized questionnaire that will purportedly enablethe client to set up an automatic investment program designedto meet their exact investment needs, we believe it's betterto sit down with our clients and discuss in more detail theirinvestment objectives and concerns -- we like to know our clients firsthand. But don't just take our word for it. Listen to What Our Clients Say About Us! Copyright Â© 1997 Tucker Anthony Incorporated. All rights reserved.

For many investors, theanswer has been to seek professional help by either investingin Mutual Fundsor by hiring a professional investmentmanager. The method you choose depends largely on the size ofyour financial assets. Mutual funds generally accept a minimuminvestment of $1,000, while an individually managed account requiresa minimum investment of $100,000. The big difference in minimuminvestment levels is due to the amount of personalized serviceprovided.

Educational Institutions--- We specialize in bringing regional education creditsto the market and are a leader in managing transactions for theregion's important independent school sector. Healthcare Organizations--- We have helped not-for-profit healthcare organizations withtax-exempt options as well as taxable sources of capital in circumstanceswhere traditional financing methods do not work well.

Of the 101 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 69% of the companies have matched or beat Wall Street's estimates. Ascend Communications Inc. (ASND) closed up 6 1/8 after the company said it earned $0.32 a share. While the report was only $0.01 higher than street consensus, the company commented that undeliverable orders were stronger than expected suggesting to some investors that last quarterï¿½s strength will continue in 1997. ASNDï¿½s announcement gave a boost to other stocks in the group: Cascade Communications Corp. (CSCC) up 8 1/8, U.S. Robotics (USRX) up 4 1/2 and Xircom (XIRC) up 2 1/4. Stocks stayed strong all day as the DJIA topped 6800 for the first time, closing up 67.73 to 6833.10 led by DuPont (DD) up 3 1/8, McDonald's Corp. (MCD) up 1 7/8, Merck & Co. (MRK) up 1 7/8 and AlliedSignal (ALD) up 1 5/8. The S&P 500 index closed up 6.39 to 776.14 and the Nasdaq OTC Composite index closed up 8.60 to 1349.06. Bond and stock investors got some help this morning from a Washington Post story ï¿½Fed Holding Off On Rate Increasesï¿½ that says the Fed wonï¿½t lift interest rates at its next meeting in February. Higher interest rates would boost borrowing costs, crimping corporate expansion plans and weakening the economy. The article follows Fed Governor Meyers' speech yesterday which suggested an acceleration in the economy could prompt the Fed to rein in inflation and that ï¿½all paths are downhillï¿½ for the U.S. economy after last yearï¿½s performance. Bonds initially fell after a Fed report showing larger-than-expected industrial output last month raised concerns about the economy growing too quickly, but they managed to erase their earlier losses when a University of Michigan survey on consumer sentiment suggested that consumers were less upbeat. The benchmark 30-year government bond closed up 2 /32 to 95 28/32 with a yield of 6.82%. Todayï¿½s Highlights: CSX Corp. (CSX) closed up 1 3/4 to 46 3/4 after shareholders voted down a proposal to exempt the company from a Pennsylvania law that blocks CSX's planned $9.3 billion acquisition of Conrail (CRR). CRR closed unchanged at 103 1/2. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) closed up 1 1/8 to 87 1/8. The companyï¿½s total assets are about 70% cash now according to a Wall Street Journal article. Some analysts believe the low yield on its cash holdings could become a drag on the overall performance and eventually its stock price. The software giant reported earnings after the close. Fiscal second-quarter earnings were $0.57 a share vs. $0.45 last year. While the report bettered the average street estimate of $0.51, the company also announced that it expects revenues to start to slowdown in July as a result of reduced revenues from maturing products and lower margins as a result of higher R&D spending and new business ventures. Paine Webber Group Inc. (PWJ) closed up 3 3/4 to 31 1/2. Business Week reported in its ï¿½Inside Wall Streetï¿½ column that an infamous ï¿½unidentified analystï¿½ says the brokerage firm could be worth $55 a share in a buyout. The article speculated that BankAmerica was a possible suitor. Perkin-Elmer Corp. (PKN) closed up 4 7/8 to 70 3/8 after the company said its fiscal second-quarter earnings rose to $1.15 a share from $0.53 a year ago, beating the street consensus of $0.63. VLSI Technology Inc. (VLSI) closed down 5 7/8 to 17 3/8 after the company said it had a fourth-quarter loss of $1.38 a share. The loss included a charge of $115.6 million for the previously announced closing of its San Jose, California wafer facility. Excluding the charge, VLSI said it would have earned a profit of $0.17 a share, a penny shy of street consensus. It was odd that the shares reacted to what was basically old news, but we do know that one analyst downgraded the shares. What bothers me the most about today's decline is the unusually high volume. We'll keep you abreast on what is going on. If you have a question about any particular stock(s) or would like more information about the overall market, please E-Mail us.

We believe a 7% yield is possible in the next several weeks, and presents a wonderful buying opportunity as the fears of strong growth/wage acceleration/inflation are overblown. We still see no changes in monetary policy in 1997. Strategy Short Term (1 week) --- The US bond market seems to have found some near-term support following the stronger-than-expected December employment report and sanguine inflation reports. Upcoming data, however, argue for more downside risk. Ironically, the near-term support is occurring as we get confirmation that the rate of growth in Q4ï¿½96 was much stronger than expected, which we attribute to renewed inflows into the US Treasury market from foreign accounts. A re-test of the downside of the 110-112 range on the bond contract is still possible as new reports of strength in Q4ï¿½96 find their way into the market. istmas sales have been determined. Medium Term (1-3 mos.) --- The rate of inflow into equity mutual funds so far in January confirms that investors were not scared away by the December volatility. Recent comments by Fed officials suggest they are not prepared to tighten policy in the near term based solely on asset inflation. Evidence of stronger albeit a noninflationary rate of Q4 growth is spooking bond market participants, but the consequent backup in interest rates should be viewed as a near-term buying opportunity, since we do not believe Q1ï¿½97 growth will be nearly as strong. We have revised up our Q4ï¿½96 GDP forecast to 4% based on the latest trade data. Bullish factors -- such as a continuation of the dollar rally, central bank buying of US Treasuries and continued progress on budget deficit reduction to be announced at the mid-January State of the Union -- all bode well for a rally in US bonds this quarter. Long Term (6-12 mos.) --- US economic fundamentals still argue for a 6%-7% trading range on the long bond in 1997. As mentioned in our commentary dated December 13th: ï¿½1997 Economic Outlook: Productivity Growth Leads Expansion into 7th Year,ï¿½ we see growth moving back to the 3%+ area by the middle to end of 1997. We currently see no substantive imbalances in the economy to justify calling for a recession or overheating.

The study attributes this to the fact that the contribution of the S&P's individual securities to the overall performance "...is weighted by the market capitalization"; consequently, the S&P 500 as-reported performance is dominated by the results of a few large stocks.

Although bonds are loans, and contain no rights ofownership, they do represent a legally enforceable promise torepay, and therefore, bondholders are classified as creditors. The life or term of any bond is fixed at the time of issue andexpires at a fixed maturity date. Upon expiration, theissuer promises to repay the loan in full, at par value (thedollar amount of the bond at the time of issue) and on time. Throughoutthe life of the loan, the bondholder receives regular interest payments. This interest amount is set when the bondis issued. The interest rate (quoted in dollars) or coupon (quotedas a percentage) is competitive with what investors can earn elsewhereon comparable investments. Bonds have varying maturity dates that range from short-term(usually one year or less), to intermediate-term (two to10 years), to long-term (10 to 30 years). Generally, the longerthe maturity, the higher the yield of the bond. This higher yieldis offered to compensate for the additional risk of tying up theinvestor's money for a longer period of time. Shorter-maturitybonds have lower yields because the risk of loss of principalis limited by the shorter time frame. The relationship of theinterest rates paid by the different bond maturities, from short-termto long-term, is called "the yield curve." Bonds don't always run their full term. You, as a bondholder,may choose to sell the bond prior to maturity (the price you receive will be based on prevailing market conditions) orthe issuer may call the bond and pay off the debt early. A callablebond is usually redeemed when interest rates drop below a bond'scoupon rate. By paying off the outstanding debt, the issuer hasthe opportunity to issue another bond at a lower rate. Callablebonds are less attractive than non-callable ones because the investorwhose bond has been called is often faced with reinvesting themoney at a possibly lower and less attractive rate. To protect bondholdersexpecting long-term steady income, callable bonds usually havecall provisions that specify that a bond can't be called beforea certain number of years, usually five to 10. It is important for investors to be aware of and understand any call provisions that may exist. If you would like more information on investing in Bonds, please E-Mail us.

Investors buy bonds primarily for the following reasons: Income The major attraction is that bonds regularly pay a set amount of interest that is generally higher than that of short-term investments such as money market funds, CDs and passbook savings accounts. For this reason, investors seeking income, such as retirees, will invest a portion of their savings in bonds to help pay their living expenses. Also attractive to some investors are the tax advantages that certain types of government and municipal obligations can offer to reduce federal, state and/or local taxes. For example, an investor in a high tax bracket could place some of his/her assets in municipal bonds which will provide income that is exempt from federal taxes and perhaps state and/or local taxes. Long-Term Growth As shown in the chart below, bonds may offer investors an attractive way to achieve long-term growth and stay ahead of inflation. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Safety of Principal Depending on the credit strength of the bond's issuer, investors who buy high-quality bonds have a reasonable expectation that their principal (the amount of the loan) will be returned in full if they hold an individual bond to maturity. Since bonds can be of higher quality than other forms of securities, they are often used for the preservation and long-term accumulation of capital (when interest payments are reinvested). Prior to maturity, bond prices in the secondary market will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Diversification For a vast majority of investors, bonds offer an attractive way to balance their investment portfolio that may contain CDs, money market funds and stocks. Although bond prices will fluctuate like stock prices, high-quality bonds are usually considered lower-risk securities. Copyright Â© 1997 Tucker Anthony Incorporated. All rights reserved.

When a bond is initially sold, the issuer establishes a stated coupon rate that is determined by current market rates and is competitive with other income investments at the time. Once issued, the price of a bond in the secondary market will be influenced by any changes in the credit rating of the underlying issuer and/or changes in market interest rates. The coupon rate will always remain constant but the price of the bond will fluctuate according to any changes in the economy, supply of money and credit and inflation expectations. On any given day, a bond's market value may be higher or lower than the investor's original purchase price. Bonds selling at less than their par value are called discounted bonds; those selling above their par value are called premium bonds. In general, bond prices and market interest rates have an opposite relationship. To form a better picture of the basic relationship, imagine a giant seesaw. Bond prices sit on one side and interest rates on the other. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; when interest rates fall, bond prices rise. A new bond is initially offered with a competitive rate, but once issued, it becomes part of a giant pool of existing securities that can be traded in an open secondary market.

U.S. Treasury securities constitute U.S. government obligations and are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the government. Since there are no limitations on the government's ability to pay its interest, Treasury securities are considered to be the safest investment. The Treasury offers three types of securities: U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and U.S. Treasury bonds. Treasury bills are non-interest-bearing, discounted securities with an original maturity of one year or less. The interest is received at maturity, and is equal to the difference between the face value received and the purchase price. Treasury notes are intermediate securities with maturities ranging from one to 10 years and Treasury bonds are long-term bonds with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. Both Treasury notes and bonds are marketable securities that pay interest semiannually. Because of their excellent marketability and credit rating and their low risk, Treasury securities generally return a yield lower than other types of fixed-income securities. There are several reasons why Treasury securities are popular with investors: Safety --- A direct obligation of the government, Treasury securities are considered the safest fixed-income investment in the world. Tax Advantages --- Treasuries are exempt from state and local taxes, which make them particularly attractive if you live in a state with high taxes. Liquidity --- If you decide to sell your securities before the maturity date, the secondary market for Treasuries is one of the largest in the world. Predictability --- In most cases, you can obtain a favorable interest rate for the life of the security. Unlike other types of bonds, such as corporates and municipals, the majority of Treasuries are non-callable. That feature means they cannot be redeemed for payment by the issuer before the maturity date. If you would like more information on investing in U.S. Treasury Securities, please E-Mail us.

GSEs are issued by major federally sponsored agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Farm Credit Banks, the Student Loan Marketing Association (SLMA), and many more. Although the debt of these federally sponsored agencies is not backed by the credit of the U.S. government, they are still considered excellent credit risks because the government is morally obligated to cover the obligation in the case of a default problem. Therefore, the risk is slightly greater than Treasuries with similar maturities, which partially explains why the yields of GSEs are higher than Treasury securities. The other reasons for the yield spread is that GSEs securities are less liquid and less marketable than Treasuries.

The agencies include authorities for housing, toll roads and school districts. Some examples of enterprises with a public purpose are hospitals and universities. The most important feature of municipal bonds is that the interest income is exempt from federal income taxes (Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) may apply). Generally, interest income is also exempt from state and local taxes if the investor lives in the state and county that issued the bond. Consequently, the bond would be triple tax exempt. The taxable equivalent yield offered by the municipal bond could exceed the yields available on comparably rated taxable investments. With a multitude of different municipal bond issues outstanding, you can select a bond issue that best suits your investment needs. Since municipal bonds are often rated based on the credit worthiness of the issuer, you could select high-quality municipal bonds that could be ranked after U.S. Treasuries and agencies in safety. In addition, investors can have an additional layer of safety since some municipal bonds have their principal and interest payments guaranteed by an insurance company for timely payment. There is a large secondary market in which you can buy and sell municipal bonds and, depending on the current market rates, you could receive more or less than par value if you sell the bond before maturity. The equivalent yield of a taxable bond at the investor's tax bracket is the yield an investor would have to earn to equal the yield on a tax-free (municipal) bond. Although Tucker Anthony is not a tax advisor, we would be happy to assist you and your accountant in meeting your individual investment requirements.

Themost popular type of these mortgage-backed securities, known as"pass-throughs" or participation certificates, are issuedby the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the FederalNational Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation (FHLMC). You probably know them by theirnicknames, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Since GNMAis an agency of the federal government, the interest and principalpayments are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.government. FNMA and FHLMC are Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) and, like other GSEs, are imbued with an indirectbacking of the U.S. government. Thus, the chances of default arenegligible at worst and more likely nonexistent. Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase high-quality residentialmortgages from lenders, package them into mortgage pools and thensell partial interest in the pools to investors in the form ofmortgage-backed bonds. Like bonds, these securities pay interest,but they pay it monthly rather than semiannually, an importantfeature if you need or want monthly income. Perhaps the greatestdifference is that investors in mortgage-backed securities receivenot only monthly interest payments, but also a partial repaymentof their principal. As with any mortgage loan, mortgage-backedsecurities will reflect a changing proportion of interest to principalover the life of the bond. Interest payments are usually receivedearly in the life of the bond and heavier principal repaymentsare received as the bonds become more seasoned. Since interestpayments are fully taxable at the federal, state and local levelsand principal repayments are not, someone in a high tax bracketmay prefer an older issue that has a higher portion of principalrepayments to the taxable interest payments. Because mortgage-backedbondholders receive both interest and principal repayments, long-terminvestors need to have a clear-cut plan for reinvesting at leastthe principal amount of their mortgage-backed bond payments eachmonth. Otherwise, they could be spending their principal. Mortgage securities are often priced at a higher yield than Treasury and corporate bonds and, therefore, their opportunities for profit and loss are also greater. As with any other type of fixed-income security, mortgage-backed securities can be sold at par or at a premium or a discount to their face value prior to maturity in a large secondary market, depending on changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, prices fall, and vice versa. Interest rate changes have an additional impact on mortgage securities because they affect the prepayment rate and, subsequently, the yield. When interest rates decline, prepayments will increase beyond the initial pricing assumptions, which could cause the average life and expected maturity period to shorten. In addition, the principal may have to be invested at a lower interest rate than the initial coupon of the security. Conversely, when interest rates rise, prepayments slow down and could cause the average life and maturity period to lengthen and the market value to decline. Because mortgage securities have different characteristics than other fixed-income securities, investors should discuss the features, risks and expected performance of the securities under varying market conditions with their Investment Executive.

A corporate bond is a loan made by a corporation in return for a specified amount of interest and repayment of the face value of the bond at a specified maturity date. The interest (coupon) rate is generally fixed for the life of the bond and the face value (par) of the bond is usually $1,000. Since corporate bonds have a higher risk of default than Treasury and GSE securities, they generally have a higher coupon yield. A good-quality corporate bond could have a coupon rate of 1 to 11/2% more than a Treasury bond having the same maturity date. There are many types of corporate bonds that can be classified as either secured or unsecured. For secured bonds, the issuer pledges an asset such as a mortgage or a piece of equipment as collateral in the event of a default. Unsecured bonds or debentures, which are the most common form of corporate bonds, are backed only by the issuer's creditworthiness and its ability to pay annual interest and principal at maturity. In the event of default, unsecured bondholders are paid after all other senior loan obligations, but before equity shareholders. Generally, corporate bond investors are more concerned with the issuer's ability to pay or risk of default rather than with security alone. In the event of a default, pledged assets may not be marketable, and it may involve some time consuming litigation. To help evaluate the risk of default on individual bond issues, most investors rely on the ratings given by commercial rating companies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Since financial conditions can change after the bond's initial rating has been set, it's important that investors regularly monitor the company's financial health. As with any other fixed-income investment, the greater the risk, the higher the coupon rate for the issue. If you would like more information on investing in Corporate Bonds, please E-Mail us.

Forexample, a 10-year World Bank zero-coupon bond yields 6.10% and costs $577.80.In other words, the investor buys this zero-coupon bond for $577.80 andreceives no interim interest payments. Then at the end of the 10th yearhe/she will receive $1,000 (the face value of the bond). Zeroes are popular in part because they give investors a valuable planningtool. You know exactly how much you will receive when the bond matures.The inherent predictability of zeroes makes them an ideal investment vehiclewhen saving for a child's college education and have become very popularin tax-advantaged retirement plans such as Individual Retirement Accounts(IRAs) and Keoghs. What's more, zeroes tend to provide a somewhathigher yield than other types of bonds with the same quality rating andmaturity. You can buy government-backed zeroes, corporate zeroes and evenzero-coupon certificates of deposit (CDs). Zeroes, like other fixed-income securities, will vary in price accordingto changes in prevailing interest rates. Since they offer no regular incomepayment, they will be more volatile than similar bonds that provide regularincome. For example, when overall interest rates rise, the price of thezero-coupon bond will decline farther than the prices of similar couponbonds. However, if interest rates were to decline, the zero-coupon bondprice would rise much higher than the equivalent coupon bond price, andgive you a much greater profit. If you are forced to sell for any reasonbefore maturity, the price you receive may be more or less than what youpaid initially. For taxable accounts, investors need to consult with their tax advisorsas to the special tax consequences of owning zero-coupon bonds. Althoughzeroes don't pay interest like a conventional coupon bond, they are subjectto income taxes on the accrued interest as if it had been paid. This taxon "phantom income" makes zero-coupon bonds better suited in tax-advantagedaccounts. An alternative for investors would be the purchase of municipalzero-coupon bonds. These bonds are issued by state and local governmentsand are advantageous in that the accrued interest is exempt from federalincome taxes and, generally, from state income taxes for residents of thestate that issued the bond.

Preferred stocks are included in the hybridcategory because they are more like a bond without a maturitydate than a stock. On the other hand, convertible bonds offerincome with the potential for higher total returns from the capitalappreciation of the issuer's common stock. Preferred Stocks Although preferred stocks represent ownership shares in a corporationsimilar to common stocks, they appeal to investors seeking safetyand current income rather than capital appreciation. Basically,preferreds pay a set dividend, which can be higher than that ofcorporate bonds and often are competitive with municipal bonds after taxes. Like bonds, the prices of preferreds are affectedby changes in interest rates and are rated by commercial ratingcompanies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Unlikebonds, preferreds generally do not have a maturity date, and they pay dividendsmonthly or quarterly rather than semiannually. The preferreddividend is guaranteed and paid before any dividends on the commonstock shares and will generally not be lowered unless the issuerundergoes some financial difficulties. If you would like more information on investing in PreferredStocks, please E-Mail us. Convertible Securities Convertible securities are unique investments that blend the characteristicsof both common stock and corporate debt into a hybrid security.Each convertible represents a specific number of shares of commonstock, which represents the equity element of the security. Theincome element is derived from the yield offered by the coupon(bond) or dividend (preferred stock) and is often lower than theincome on straight bonds although it generally exceeds the incomepaid by the comparable common stock. Convertibles are issued in one of two forms: bonds or preferredstock. Convertible bonds offer the investor a fixed rate of interestand like regular bonds represent the debt obligations of the issuer.This obligation means that the company must pay interest on thebond before any dividends are paid on preferred or common stocks.Convertible preferreds offer the investor a fixed dividend. Althoughthe dividends are not guaranteed, they are typically cumulativeand offer a higher yield than that of the underlying common stock. For fixed-income investors, convertibles offer the opportunity for greater upside than your typical bond because of the potential of capital gains through the appreciation of the underlying common stock. However, convertibles also have the chameleon-like characteristic of acting more like a bond if the stock price falls. Although the price of the convertible will also fall as the stock declines, it will not decline at the same pace. The income yield of the convertible will cushion the decline and can act as a floor based on its value as a straight bond or a preferred stock.

The degree of risk, however, will vary with the type of debt and the issuer. As we discussed in Why Do Bond Prices Fluctuate?, there is interest rate risk and the possibility that you could lose money if you try to sell a bond before maturity. This possibility doesn't mean that you should stash your money under your mattress and hide because that also entails a risk of loss. Besides, if interest rates were to fall, you could also have a capital gain. You can minimize some of your risks by working with a Tucker Anthony Investment Executive and implementing some Fixed Income Investing Strategies such as laddering and matching your bond maturities to your investment goals. Another risk depends on the creditworthiness of the issuer of the bond. Is the issuer able to make the scheduled interest payments and repay the principal at maturity? Credit risks vary with different types of bonds. U.S. Treasury Securities carry the least amount of risk and U.S. agency debt has a slightly higher amount of risk. Credit risks are usually associated more with bonds issued by state and local governments that depend on their ability to raise revenues, and with corporate issuers whose credit risks are linked to their financial health and earning capacity. You can minimize this risk by having a Tucker Anthony Investment Executive help you monitor the issuer's credit rating either through independent rating services or through fixed income research. Perhaps the greatest risk to bond holders is the risk of inflation. Since bond coupons are generally fixed, the value of the interest payments can be affected by inflation. When inflation rises, bond prices tend to fall because the purchasing power of the coupon payments are reduced. So you can say bonds are not a good hedge against inflation. To combat inflation risk, you can invest in bonds whose rates of return exceed the anticipated rate of inflation or bonds with adjustable interest rates. Don't forget that even CDs and Treasury bills are affected by inflation. If you would like some assistance on minimizing Bond Risks, please E-Mail us. Copyright Â© 1997 Tucker Anthony Incorporated.

In a world of falling interest rates, it is easy to become a yield junkie and seek out the highest possible return by buying long-term bonds. However, if interest rates were to rise in the future, a single bet on long-term bonds would leave you with an under-performing portfolio. If, for some reason, you had to sell your bonds early, you may have to offer them at a discount because the newer ones being issued have a higher yield and pay more interest. Bond Laddering One of the simplest methods of protecting yourself against interest rate risk is to structure a bond ladder with each rung consisting of a different maturity bond. At its simplest, a laddered portfolio would consist of bonds with maturities of one year, two years, three years, right on out through 10 years. Although bond laddering won't produce higher yields than you could receive by only buying 20-year bonds, it does provide an element of safety through diversification that you don't have if your portfolio is invested entirely in long-term bonds. As each "rung" matures, you receive both new money to invest and some protection from rising rates. You also have some protection from falling rates because you have locked in higher yields on the rungs with longer-term bonds. The nice thing about laddering is that it's simple and requires minimal maintenance. Other Strategies There are other strategies such as "bar belling," "liability matching" and "buying the yield curve." However, before you begin implementing any of these methods you need to examine the risks and rewards of each one and should take into account such parameters as cash needs (how much income do you need?), risk tolerances, time horizon (when do you need the income?), and economic projections. For those who choose not to structure their own bond portfolio, other avenues for investing in fixed-income securities are available. Investors can seek professional management help by using either Bond Funds or Personalized Portfolio Management. The choice depends on how much assistance you want and how much money you have to invest. Investors can choose from a variety of fixed-income funds that range from security-specific investments such as U.S. government bond funds and tax-exempt funds or a fund that invests within a certain maturity range, for example five to 10 years. Basically, there is a fund to suit every taste. Investors committing larger amounts of money, usually $100,000 or more, can invest through professional money managers who will structure a portfolio to accommodate their personal needs as well as provide a host of additional services.

When investors put money into a mutual fund,it is pooled with money from other investors to create a largerportfolio than most individuals could create by investing on their own. Most funds diversify their holdings bybuying a wide variety of investments. The portfolio created mayinclude stocks, bonds or other securities and is managed by aprofessional investment company. Since a fund can own dozens or even hundreds of different securities, its success or failureis not going to be dependent on how well a handful of securitiesperform. Each mutual fund has a professional money manager whobuilds and manages the fund's portfolio in accordance with itsstated investment objective. In order to invest in a mutual fund, an investorbuys shares of the fund and becomes a shareholder. A mutual fundmakes money in two ways: by earning dividends or interest on itsinvestments and by selling investments that have appreciated inprice. The fund pays out, or distributes, its profits (less feesand expenses) to its shareholders. Most funds offer investorsthe option of reinvesting all or part of their distributions inthe fund by buying more shares. From an investment perspective, mutual fundsmake sense and are most profitable when they are held for thelong term. They should not be treated as transaction accountsbecause of the sales or redemption charges and potential tax liabilities. If you would like to learn more about Mutual Funds, please E-Mail us.

The reason will become clearer as you examine the following reasons: Diversification Pooling shareholder dollars means that themutual fund can buy dozens and sometimes hundreds of differentsecurities. The average investor would find it difficult to amassa portfolio as diversified as that of a mutual fund. The powerof diversification is that losses from certain securities cansometimes be offset or even overshadowed by gains in others. This diversification helps reduce risks since the fund's success is not dependent onhow one or two holdings perform. Professional Management For those investors who have concluded thatall this investing stuff is not their "cup of tea,"mutual funds provide low-cost access to professional money management.Many individual investors recognize that they are better at theirown careers than they are as part-time money managers. The money accumulated in a mutual fund is managedby professionals who decide where to invest it. Decisions arebased on the research of the fund's analysts and by the manager'sactual visits to the companies. As economic conditions change,the fund may adjust its investments to adopt a more aggressiveor defensive position. Liquidity Mutual fund investors can sell all or any partof their investment on any given business day based on the fund'sclosing Net Asset Value (NAV) and the price a fund pays you pershare when you sell. NAV is the dollar value of one share of thefund and is determined by dividing the current value of the fundby the number of shares currently outstanding. Because the pricefluctuates daily, the current value may be more or less than theoriginal amount invested. Investors can find closing prices publishedeach day in the mutual fund section of most newspapers. Low Initial Investment Many mutual funds accept a minimum initialinvestment of $1,000 and even smaller if the funds are in IndividualRetirement Accounts (IRAs). You may be able to investeven less money initially if you establish an automatic investingplan with a mutual fund company. These kinds of plans usuallyrequire a $50 minimum investment with a monthly contribution ofat least $50. Subsequent investments may be automatically deductedfrom a payroll or checking account. (See Dollar-Cost Averaging.) Potential For Monthly Income Most people buy income funds because they pay monthlydividends. This schedule gives investors a chance tobudget and pay their bills. Investors may also withdraw incomefrom an equity fund by selling shares under a systematic withdrawalplan. However, investors should be aware that any time the numberof shares is reduced, the value of the account will be reducedif the market goes down.

Since funds may invest for current income, long-termgrowth or a combination of both, there are three ways to trackperformance and judge how well a fund has done: NAV Change--- a fund's share price is the dollar value of one share of thefund and is determined by dividing the current value of the fundby the number of shares currently outstanding. The NAV increaseswhen the value of the holdings increase. For example, if one shareof XYZ fund costs $15 today and cost $10 a year ago, then there hasbeen a profit (or capital gain) of $5 per share. Yield--- measures the amount of income a fund provides as a percentageof its current price or NAV. For example, if ACME long-term bondfund has a NAV of $10 and is paying a dividend of $.60 per share,the yield on the fund would be 6.00% ($.60 Ã· $10 = 6.00%). Total Return--- measures how much income a fund has made and how much moneya fund has made or lost over time. It's defined as the percentagechange in the purchase price (NAV) including any distribution(income and/or capital gains) that have been paid. In addition,any sales charges that have been made must be added into the initialpurchase price. For example, if you purchased a fund for $10 ayear ago that is now selling for $12 and received a $2 distribution,the total return would be 40% ($2 distribution + $2 price appreciation= $4 gain on your original investment). You can evaluate a fund in relation to otherways you could have invested such as stocks or bonds, but sincereturn is calculated differently for each type of investment,there isn't a simple formula for comparing mutual funds to individualsecurities. It's like comparing apples to oranges. One way investorscan measure a fund's performance is to compare its return againsta major market index that reports on the same kind of investmentsthe fund makes. For example, a gain or loss in a general stockfund could be compared to the Standard & Poor's 500 StockIndex and a bond fund could be compared to a government/corporatebond index. However, index figures do not include reinvested dividends,interest or transaction costs, so they can't be compared directlyto total return figures. Another method to evaluate a fund's performanceis to compare its performance with other funds that have the sameobjective or to industry benchmarks provided by such companiesas Lipper Analytical Services and Morningstar, Inc.

The plan also helps investors who do havea lump sum to invest, but are afraid to enter the market for fearof a correction. By using dollar-cost averaging, investors canease their way into the market and take advantage of any priceweakness to lower their average purchase cost. Since the success ofthe plan depends on fixed periodic investments, investors shouldconsider their financial ability and willingness to continue purchasingthrough periods of declining markets. Dollar-cost averaging is a systematic investingplan that involves buying equal dollar amounts of investmentsat set intervals, i.e., monthly, quarterly, etc. The table belowshows a hypothetical investment of $400 every quarter for oneyear. Although the amount stays the same, the share price fluctuatesbetween $10 and $25 over the course of a year. When the priceof the shares is $10, the $400 investment buys 40 shares; whenthe price is $25, the investment of $400 buys 16 shares. By using this investment plan with fixed periodicpayments, you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewershares when they are higher. Over time, the plan typically resultsin an average share cost that is lower than the average shareprice over the same time period. Strategically, the plan forcesinvestors to be in the market when prices are depressed, but alsowhen prices are high. Although dollar-cost averaging does not assurean investor a profit or protect against a loss in a decliningmarket, it does help to eliminate emotions when investing in themarket.

In comparing the historical performanceof various financial assets, stocks are unmatched in their abilityto appreciate and stay ahead of inflation over time.This ability makes them ideal investments for meeting long-term financialgoals. Historical Performance Although investing in stocks has no performanceguarantees, past history has shown that over time stocks haveproduced better returns than other financial instruments. As thefollowing chart illustrates, $1.00 invested in stocks on December31, 1925 significantly outpaced cash equivalents and bonds. Link to Ibbotson Associates Decade in and decade out, stocks offer thelargest total returns of any asset class. Bonds may outshine stocksone year, real estate the next, and even gold once in a while.But over a 10-year span, stocks have consistently outperformedthem all. Link to Ibbotson Associates Stay Ahead of Inflation Even though the inflation rate fluctuates fromyear-to-year, it still takes a bite out of your investments overtime. For example, suppose you were able to earn 10% annuallyon your investment portfolio -- not inconceivable since it isclose to the compound annual return of 10.2% for large companystocks from 1925-1994. Although we can agree that 10% is an achievablereturn, remember that the 10% is before taxesand before inflation. If you are in the top tax brackets, you caneasily say good-bye to one-third of your return leaving you withan after tax return of 6.6%. Now subtract inflation. If the economyis growing slowly, inflation could be running a modest 3%, thusleaving you with a total net return of 3.6%. If you think it onlylooks bad in this example, consider this -- according to a studydone by Ibbotson Associates, a single person earning $75,000 in1989 dollars who invested (excluding any state taxes) in 30-dayTreasury bills over the five-year period from 1990-1994 earned,after taxes and inflation, a net return of -0.3%. Granted in someyears you can earn more than the average, such as last year's 30%-plusgain, but there are also years where you may earn less or evenhave a negative return. Clearly, it is important to consider inflationand taxes when formulating any investment strategy. Copyright Â© 1997 Tucker Anthony Incorporated. All rights reserved.

Many professionalswill try to make sense of it by sub-dividing stocks into variouscategories: by industry such as healthcare or technology; by size(market capitalization) such as large, medium and small; and byrelative sensitivity to the economic cycle such as growth andcyclical. The following are some of the categories: Blue Chip Stocks Growth Stocks Small-Company Stocks Income Stocks Cyclical Stocks Defensive Stocks Special Situations Speculative Stocks Value Stocks Just by looking at the number of differentcategories, you will see that all stocks are not created equal.Each type of stock has its own unique set of characteristics rangingfrom how they are valued to their historical performance duringdifferent phases of the business and market cycles. One thing to remember about classifying stocksis that the lines of demarcation between types are not preciseand clear. In fact, there are times when a stock can fall intoseveral categories. For example, a utility stock can be classifiedas both an income and a defensive stock. Stocks can also lose their status. ConsiderIBM as an example: once labeled "the bluest of the blue chips,"it fell from grace during the mid-1980s and early 1990s as computingpower moved from the main frame to PCs. Shareholders who ignoredthe fundamental changes occurring at IBM watched their sharesdecline from a high of nearly $175 in 1987 to under $50 a shareby 1994. Fortunately, new management has since redirected thecompany's focus and the stock has recovered part of the decline. Blue Chip Stocks --- high-grade, investment-quality issues of major companies that usually have a long and unbroken record of earnings growth and dividend payments. They usually hold key, if not leading, positions in their industry. The companies have the fundamental strength and size to hold their own during a recession and enough resources to capitalize on an economic recovery. By and large, investors who seek safety and stability and are conservative in their approach to investing will turn to this group. Growth Stocks--- usually companies whose sales,earnings and market share are expanding faster than the generaleconomy and their industry average. The firms are usually aggressive,research minded and will facilitate their expansion by plowingtheir earnings back into the business. Since investors will generallyplace a higher value for this above-normal growth, the price-earningsratios of these stocks will be higher than their peers and averagestocks and the dividend yield will usually be lower. Small-Company / Emerging-Growth Stocks ---a label given to smaller or emerging companies that havesurvived their formative years and have entered a period of strongearnings gains with expanding unit sales and profit margins. Usuallythese stocks are traded over-the-counter (OTC) or on the AmericanStock Exchange (Amex). Technology companies are a good exampleof a stock in this category. Although these stocks have the potentialfor very high growth, they also have a higher risk so their stockprices will be very volatile. Income Stocks--- some investors, particularlythe elderly and retired, buy stocks for current income. Althoughstocks often yield less than bonds, there are some stocks thatare classified as income stocks because they pay higher than averagedividends. Selecting income stocks can be tricky since a highdividend yield doesn't always insure safety. The stockmay have a high dividend yield because the shares have fallenin price over concerns about the safety of the dividend. The stockcould also be languishing in an unpopular industry with no future.Investors can avoid mistakes by staying with quality stocks thatdemonstrate a steady trend of rising dividends. Cyclical Stocks--- companies whose earnings andprofits are tied to the economy and whose stock prices fluctuatewith the business cycle. When economic conditions are good, thecompany's profitability is enhanced and the company'sstock rises. When the economy falters, business for the companyfalls off along with its profits and stock price. Industries typicallyclassified as cyclical include: steel, chemical, paper, machinery,airline, railroad, and automotive. Defensive Stocks--- recession-resistant companies.Although these companies may lack the glamour of high-growth companiesand market leaders, they are characterized by their degree ofstability during periods of economic uncertainty and decline.Examples of defensive stocks would include: electric and gas utilities,food, beverage, and drug companies. Special-Situation Stocks --- it'ssort of a catch-all category for stocks that aren't easily classifiedinto the other groups. Typically, the reason someone likes thestock is not due to the normal reasons most investors buy a stock-- i.e., higher earnings, new product introduction, etc. Thereason someone likes the stock may be new management,a possible takeover or the possibility of a favorablecourt ruling. In any case, the reasons have a higher degree ofuncertainty because of the difficulty in predicting the outcomeof future events. Although special situations aren't for everyone,an investor can increase his/her chances of making money if thereis also an underlying fundamental case for buying the stock. Speculative Stocks--- any stock that sells more onhope than on fundamentals. They usually have a great story, butlack the earnings and revenue history or visibility of more establishedcompanies. Since there are no guarantees that a company can meetan investor's future earnings and revenue expectations, the stockprice can be highly volatile. Before investing in any speculativestock, you should remember the phrase: Caveat Emptor! BuyerBeware! We are not saying that you can't make money in these stocks,we just think you should understand the risks up front. Investorsshould gather enough information on the company so that they cantell the difference between a stock with a high potential fromone that is a long shot with no value other than speculative appeal. Value Stocks --- stocks that appear inexpensiverelative to earnings, dividends, sales, or other fundamental factors.History has revealed that market preference for growth stocksand value stocks tend to alternate in cycles. For example, whengrowth stocks are leading, or in favor, value stocks are lagging,or out of favor, and vice versa.

There isn'ta day that the market is open that an investor can't find outhow stocks performed for the day. It's not the price of the Treasury's30-year bond, the price of a commercial office tower in Bostonor the price of your house that people want to hear about --it's the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average alwaysgets its daily dues on the evening news because millions of peopleare interested in the stock market. Although the daily changes in stock prices may seem to have no explanation to a novice investor, they are the result of a number of risks: Economic ---the strength of the economy will influence whether or not a companyand the market will be able to meet investors' earnings expectations.However, each industry and type of stock will be affected differently.Growth stocks and cyclical stocks will rise with an expandingeconomy and fall as times get tough. Defensive issues likefood, beverage and drug companies, on the other hand, will have a tendency to outperformother stocks during periods of economic slowdown or uncertainty. Interest Rate--- higher rates affect stocks inseveral ways. First, higher rates will cause borrowing costs togo up, thus making it more difficult for companies to grow andincrease their profits. Second, higher rates also mean that moneywill be attracted away from the stock market and into other investments,such as bonds, which many investors will perceive as safer. Lowerrates will have the opposite effect. Market --- ever notice that whenthe stock market rallies, most stocks post gains and when themarket falls off sharply, most stocks will decline. This fluctuation is knownas market risk. A change in "market psychology" cancause a stock or the market to decline regardless of any fundamentalchange in the company's earnings outlook. Business --- these are the risks that arecompany specific. What's the competition and how are they doing?How is management doing? What's the outlook for the company nextyear? All of these factors will determine if the stock will attractbuyers or sellers. Financial --- it always helps to invest ina financially healthy company. It's very difficult for a companyto grow if it is burdened by an unreasonable amount of debt andthe company's financial health is deteriorating. If you understand the risks involved in buyingstocks, we think you'll be a better investor and more preparedto take advantage of the ups and downs of the market.

As shownin the following chart of the S&P 500 index between 1950-1995,stocks provided a positive total return in 34 of the years, butalso had a negative return in 12 of them. The "fear of losing"part of their investment during the down years is what preventsmany investors from investing in stocks. But looking at the annual returns of stocks can give you a distorted picture. Although past performance is nota guarantee of future results, history will show you that timeis on your side when you invest in stocks. As the following chart shows, the longeryou hold stocks, the number of down periods diminish. Using afive-year holding period from 1950-1995, the number of downperiods drops from 12 to three, but holding stocks for a 15-yearperiod provided a positive return 100% of the time. In fact it'strue for any consecutive 15-year period since 1926. As thechart illustrates, a long holding period is required for successfullyinvesting in stocks.

They also have different investment goals andstrategies. Depending on its focus, a bond fund may buy U.S. Treasury Securities, Municipal Bonds, Zero-Coupon Bonds, and Corporate Bonds, as an individual investor would. For a brief description on the different types of bond funds available to you, please choose the following sections: Taxable Fixed-Income Funds Tax-Exempt Funds Investors have a large selection of incomefunds from which to choose, including taxable or tax-free; investment grade for steady income and safety;or a riskier, high-yield fund that buys "junk bonds"for higher income. Investors may also select different maturitiessuch as short-, intermediate- or long-term Treasury bond funds. Since many individual bonds may sell for $5,000or more, small investors can buy into a bond fund that offersa more diversified portfolio than they could buy on theirown. They can also make additional purchases in the future ineven smaller amounts than the standard initial minimum investmentrequirement of $1,000.

However, each stock fund's portfolio will vary dependingon the fund's investment objectives. Some funds will stress growth,some income and some a combination of both. They will also differin the amount of investment risk they take. For example, one fundmay only buy established growth stocks while another will buystocks in emerging growth companies. Like individual investors, funds will buy Blue Chip Stocks for income and safety; Growth Stocks for future appreciation; Value Stocks for stabilityand growth; and Cyclical Stocks to take advantageof periods of economic growth. However, the major difference inbuying a fund rather than individual stocks is the diversity thatan investor can attain for the same amount of money. Capital Appreciation or Aggressive GrowthFunds --- aim for maximum capitalappreciation, primarily through the use of equities. Some of theinvestment strategies may include high portfolio turnover, leveraging,purchasing unregistered securities, and options. If the marketconditions are not right, the portfolio manager may hold a largecash position. On a continuum, this category is very speculativeand volatile with the risk of above-average losses to receiveabove-average gains. Growth Funds--- invest in companies whose long-term earnings are expectedto grow significantly faster than the stocks represented in themajor stock market indices. The stocks are generally in mid- orlarge-capitalization companies whose earnings are expected torise faster than those of the overall market. Growth fundsare generally considered to be more conservative than capitalappreciation or aggressive growth funds. Small-Company Growth Funds--- limit their investments to companies based on size.Average market capitalization may be anywhere from the micro $50million to the larger $950 million. Investors should be awarethat small stocks run in market cycles and can be extremely volatile.Small stocks are generally considered very speculative and volatilewith the risk of above-average losses in an attempt to receive highergains. Growth and Income Funds--- seek capital appreciation as well as dividend income. Thefunds generally buy stocks that pay high dividends and show goodearnings growth. They often pay quarterly dividends and when reinvested,offer a form of "forced" Dollar-Cost Averaging, which adds to this type of fund's more conservative nature when comparedto growth or aggressive growth funds. Risk of loss is consideredaverage. Sector Funds--- focus on stocks of a particular industry or segment of theeconomy, such as technology, healthcare or financial services.Unlike most mutual funds that are diversified across differentindustries, sector funds are more specific. Although the funds aremore diversified than a single stock, there is nothing in their portfolios to offset a downturn in the sector. Since sectorsare highly volatile, they offer opportunity for large gains toinvestors who ride the right wave. If you would like more information on investingin Stock Funds, please E-Mail us.

These funds are invested primarily in short-term debt instruments and are competitive with bank savings accounts and CDs. Since many of the funds were sold by securities broker/dealers, investors had the additional confidence that their money market account was insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Unlike other mutual funds, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of each share of a money market fund is supposed to be held constant at $1.00. This constant price means that for every dollar invested in the fund, you should get back a dollar, plus whatever interest your money earned from the fund's investments. As an added appeal, most money market funds allow investors to write checks against their account balances. Although the majority of money market funds are managed conservatively, there are some risks to consider. First, during periods of declining interest rates, investors should not seek the highest yielding fund since the funds may have stretched to improve their yields by taking on more risk. Since the rate a fund pays should be roughly the same as short-term Treasury bills, commercial paper and CDs, anything substantially higher should be a warning sign to investors. Second, there is reinvestment risk during periods of declining interest rates. Because the average maturity of the investments held in a money market fund is relatively short, your money market rate will soon decline, thus forcing you to keep reinvesting you money at lower and lower rates. For these reasons, money market funds are generally used to invest money for the short-term rather than long-term. You may invest in one of the three no-load money market funds offered by Tucker Anthony and managed by Freedom Capital Management Corporation: Freedom Cash Management Fund --- invests in a diversified portfolio of high-grade money market instruments. Freedom Government Securities Fund --- invests exclusively in obligations issued or guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities. Freedom Tax-Exempt Fund --- invests in a diversified portfolio of high-quality, short-term municipal securities. An investment in a money market is not insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. Government and that there can be no assurance the funds will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00. Each of these alternatives declares income daily and pays income monthly. Client accounts are protected by the Securities Protection Act and the regulations under it, for up to $10 million per customer. Up to $500,000 is covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and up to an additional $9.5 million is covered under an insurance policy issued by an affiliate of Wexford Clearing Services Corporation. Coverage of cash is limited to $100,000. If you would like a prospectus on any of the Freedom Money Market Funds, please E-Mail us. Copyright Â© 1997 Tucker Anthony Incorporated. All rights reserved.

Mutual funds that invest in overseas marketshave become quite popular in the last decade for several reasons. First, investing a portion of a portfolio overseas increases thetotal diversification of one's holdings while at the same timetaking advantage of global opportunities. Second, overseas fundsgive even small investors access to financial markets that theycould not enter on their own. Finally, because of the differentrisks associated with global investing, professional money managementis especially important for investors seeking opportunities overseas.Although professional money management doesn't necessarily guaranteesuccess, few individual investors have the experience to handlethe currency risks or the resources required to invest in foreignmarkets. Just like domestic funds, investors can choose stock,bond and short-term money market funds. When investing overseas, investors must recognizethat the value of any fund that invests in another country isdirectly affected not only by market conditions, but also by foreignexchange rates. Overseas bond funds can be less dependable asan income producer because of changes in the dollar's value. Ifa bond fund is earning high interest, but the country's currencyis weak against the dollar, the income will be less. For example,if a bond fund earns Â£100 when Â£1 equals $2, the yieldwould translate into $200. If the pound should fall in value towhere Â£1 equals $1.50, the yield would translate to only$150. However, currency risks can be a double-edged sword. Ifthe pound should rise against the dollar to where Â£1 equaled$2.50, the yield would translate to $250. As you can see, currency fluctuations can confusesome investors. Some professionals try to use it to their advantageby attempting to pull off a "triple" by buying a cheapstock or bond in a currency that they believe will strengthenagainst the dollar. If they are successful, they will gain notonly from the capital appreciation of the stock or bond and fromany income generated from dividends or interest payments, butalso an extra return from the appreciating currency. However,the value of the U.S. dollar and the foreign currency can alsogo against you and reduce your investment return. Some portfoliomanagers may try to negate currency risks by hedging strategieswhile others simply ignore the currency fluctuations, figuringthat in the long run the ups and downs will even themselves out. Global Funds--- invest at least 25% of their portfolio in securities tradingoutside the United States and may own U.S. securities as well.Global funds are usually considered to be more conservative thaninternational funds or single-country funds because of a globalfund's broader investment diversification and flexibility. Investorsmay invest through a global stock or bond fund. International Funds--- also known as overseas funds, international funds invest 100%of their assets in foreign stock or bond markets. These fundsbalance risk by spreading their investments throughout the worldby owning securities not only in mature, slow-growing economies,but also in the booming economies of many smaller countries. Investorsmay invest through an international stock or bond fund. Regional Funds--- concentrate on a particular area, like Latin America, Europeor the Pacific Rim in order to capitalize on the strength of thatparticular part of the world's economy. Like other diversifiedfunds, regional funds balance their risks by investing in severaldifferent countries. However, the risks will be greater sincevarious regional factors such as economics and politicscan greatly impact the fund. Country Funds--- concentrate their investments in a single country such as China,Mexico or Germany. The risk of investing in a single-countryfund is that there is nothing in the portfolio to offset a downturnin the country's fortunes, whether political or economic.

Most frequently, income fundspay monthly dividends that may be taken in cash or reinvestedto buy additional shares.

Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Funds--- invest at least 65% of their assets in adjustable-rate mortgagesecurities or other securities collateralized by or representingan interest in mortgages. Short-Term / Intermediate-Term U.S.Treasury Funds --- invest at least65% of their assets in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds withdollar-weighted maturities of five years or less for short-termfunds and from five to 10 years for the intermediate-term funds.

Mortgage / GNMA Funds--- invest at least 65% of their assets in mortgages or securitiesissued or guaranteed by the U.S. government and certain federalagencies or fully in Government National Mortgage Association(GNMA) securities. Any guarantee by the government or its agenciesapplies only to the interest and principal payments of an individualbond and does not guarantee that the bond, and therefore the funditself, won't fluctuate in price. High Current Income Funds--- aim for high relative current yield from fixed-income securities,with no quality or maturity restrictions. Higher income is achievedas a result of the risks associated with investing in lower-gradeor "junk bond" debt issues.

State specific tax-free fundsare exempt from both federal and state taxes and are thereforeconsidered double tax-exempt.

General Municipal Bond Funds--- invest at least 65% of their assets in municipal bonds carryingany of the top four credit ratings. Insured Municipal Bond Funds---at least 65% of the fund's holdings have been insuredfor timely payment of interest, but not against the loss of principal.Even though a bond is insured, it will fluctuate in price beforematurity just like any other bond. Single-State Municipal Bond Funds--- since there are no federal taxes on municipal bond fund distributions,and no state and local taxes for investors who live in the municipalitythat issues the bond, single-state "muni" funds limittheir investments to tax-exempt securities in a particular state.For example, New York City investors can buy triple tax-free NewYork funds and keep all of their earnings "tax free."

Begin a folder to keep all the information together. Be sure you have theinformation you need about any witnesses. You might want to take photographsof the cars involved, the location of the accident, and your injuries. Drawa diagram of the accident scene with sufficient detail as to locations oflandmarks and vehicles to assist your recollection later on. The insurance company for the driver at fault may want you to give thema statement, either in person or on the phone. We recommend that you notgive such a statement, at least without first consulting with an attorney. You do want to talk with your own insurance company, however, so that youcan receive any medical payment or personal injury protection benefits thatmay be available. Keep An Injury Diary People either forget or repress many of the problems they sufferafter a serious injury. You should begin keeping your diary up-to-dateimmediately. This information can be invaluable at the time of settlementnegotiations or trial. You should record the following information in yourdiary: A list of your injuries. Explain your pain and discomfort. Explain how your injuries have affected your job performance. Explain how your injuries have affected your day-to-day activities. Do you have any trouble getting dressed, driving a car, sleeping? Have you been unable to ski, dance, garden, golf or participate in yourother hobbies? Have you missed any family outings, vacations or church activities? Recovering From Your Injuries The most important matter to keep in mind is that you recover fully,or as much as possible, from all your injuries. You should faithfully followany instructions from your doctor, and be sure to keep any appointments withspecialists, physical therapists, etc. In our view, legal issues shouldbe secondary to your full recovery. Doctor Reports Please be aware and assume that everything stated and/or observedby your doctor may be taken down in detailed notes. These notes, or a reportmade from them, are later read by the insurance company when it is time tonegotiate the value of your personal injury claim. The value of your claimlargely depends on your doctors' reports. If your doctor is not aware ofyour limitations, pain, etc., he/she will not provide that information inthe report. If your doctor feels an injury is exaggerated, it may be putin a report. Give Complete Information To Your Doctor Remember to tell your doctor about all your pains, discomforts, andlimitations. Your doctor will determine whether the complaints are relatedto the accident. Some problems may seem minor, but relate to another injuryin another part of your body. Your doctor will need this information in orderto properly treat you. Try to be as accurate and objective as possible; underno circumstances should you fabricate or exaggerate any problems. Includethe following information: Complaints of pain immediately after the accident and symptoms whichdeveloped within the first few days. Describe how the accident happened and what caused your injuries duringimpact (connect your injuries with what happened to your body during impact).For example, your head struck the windshield causing head injury. Symptoms that developed later and what symptoms you are presently having. How long each symptom lasted. Tell your doctor about any job related activities that affect your injuriesand if your job performance is adversely affected. Your doctor then can determinewhether your injuries prevent you from performing your job for a certainamount of time or permanently. If you return to work and find that your injuries are aggravated,return to your doctor. Your doctor may recommend you stop work for awhile,or reassure you that working will not interfere or prolong your recovery. If your doctor recommends that you not work for awhile, the insurancecompany will require something in writing from your doctor indicating thetime period that you are to remain off work Income Loss Verification If you lost any income through employment or odd jobs, those lossesmust be documented. You may also have wage benefitsavailable under your auto policy, or another auto policy, such as the driveror owner of the car. In addition, if you were employed there might be wageloss benefits available through your employer or union. If you are goingto be off work for any length of time, it is important to explore every avenue. Medical Bills Be certain to contact all your own insurance carriers immediatelyregarding payment of bills. You may have PersonalInjury Protection or Medical Payments coverage available through anauto policy. You might also have health insurance that can help. Out of Pocket Expenses Keep receipts from any prescriptions or medications that you havehad to purchase and any other out-of-pocket expenses. Also keep track ofmileage to see medical providers, particularly if you are required to travelsignificant distances to get treatment for your injuries. Some of theseexpenses may be reimbursable at the time of settlement with the insurancecompany.

Common Law Negligence Every contested auto accident involves two major issues - "liability"and "damages." Liability simply means that the other party must be legallyliable before he or she has any obligation to pay compensation for injuries. (Damages are discussed elsewhere at our web site. Refer to ourcivil page for a listing of damages issues discussed.) Legal liability in a motor vehicle accident is most frequently based uponthe law of negligence. Negligence is a concept that goesback hundreds of years to the English "common law," and it refers to failureto exercise reasonable care under the circumstances. The fact that an accident occurred does not necessarily mean anyone wasat fault; some accidents are legally considered unavoidable, meaning no oneis legally liable. Although recent case law has made some changes, thereare four elements of negligence which traditionally must be present in everycase before the negligent person (sometimes referred to as a "tortfeasor")has an obligation to pay damages: Duty Breach of Duty Causation Damages When you are operating a motor vehicle, you have aduty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of otherson the road. That usually means that you must drive at speeds that are reasonableunder the circumstances, keep your vehicle under control, keep a lookoutfor what is going on around you, obey traffic laws, etc. If you do not live up to your obligations, you have breached theduty. For example, imagine a straight stretch of road where normallyit is safe and legal to travel 45 MPH. However, on a particular night thefog is so thick that you can't see ten feet. If you travel 45 MPH that nightand run into another vehicle, you have breached your duty to drive reasonablyunder the circumstances. However, in order to be held legally liable under the law of negligence,your breach of duty must be the cause of injury or damage to another. Continuing with the same example, if you travel 45 MPH down thisfoggy road at night but do not strike another vehicle, hit a person, or inany way cause any damage or injury, then you are not negligent. You mayhave violated the law and could receive a traffic citation, but you are notnegligent. Similarly, you might cause some type of incident but no damage to anotherperson, in which case you still would not be negligent. Let us imagine thatin your race through the fog you strike a wall, damaging your car but causingno damage to the wall. You are not legally liable to anyone, since yourbreach of duty has not caused any damage. Negligence law can be fairly simple, as when one driver is inattentiveand rearends another vehicle lawfully stopped at a red light. However, itcan also be maddeningly complex, as when several people are involved,eyewitnesses differ in their accounts, and no one can agree on the facts,let alone what the legal obligations were. Statutory Negligence If the operator of a vehicle violates one of the rules of the roadand the violation causes an accident, that is referred to as statutorynegligence. So for example, if the law prohibits passing over a solid line,and you pass over a solid line anyway and hit an oncoming car, the operatorof that car would claim that you were negligent for violating the statute. Not every statutory violation makes you legally liable for an auto accident,however. For examples, in most states the fact that a driver does not havea legal drivers license, or is not insured as required by state law, doesnot create legal liability for an accident. It may, however, subject thedriver to other sanctions, depending upon state law. Contributory Negligence and Comparative Negligence Sometimes there is more than one person who is at fault in causingan accident. Whether an injured person can recover damages from a thirdparty depends upon how their particular state applies the law of contributoryand comparative negligence. Let's take a simple example. John and Betty are each driving a car andcollide in an intersection where there are no stop signs, traffic lightsor other markings. Each claims the other was going too fast for thecircumstances and not maintaining a proper lookout entering the intersection. Betty was injured in the accident and sues John, alleging that John wasnegligent. For his defense, John argues that Betty herself was negligent. The case is tried and goes to the jury. Let's assume the jury would awardBetty damages for her injuries in the amount of $10,000. In a contributory negligence jurisdiction, if the jury findsBetty was the least bit negligent and contributed to the accident, then Bettywould recover nothing. Therefore, even if Betty is only 5% at fault andJohn is 95% at fault, Betty recovers $0. In a comparative negligence jurisdiction, if a jury finds thatBetty is 5% at fault and John is 95% at fault, Betty would still be ableto recover, but her $10,000 in damages would be reduced by her 5% of fault,so that Betty would recover only $9,500. Comparative negligence differs among states. For example, if Betty isfound to be 50% at fault, and John 50% at fault, some comparative negligencestates would still allow Betty to recover $5,000 (50% of her damages), whileother states would prevent her from recovering at all because she is equallyat fault with the other driver. Still other states draw the line at 51%, following the principle thata plaintiff who is MORE negligent than a defendant should not be able torecover anything. For example, in Oregon, Betty would recover $5,000 if sheis 50% negligent, but if she is 51% negligent, she would recover nothing. Finally, there are about 13 states which have "pure comparative negligence"law. This means that a jury could conclude that Betty is 90% at fault forthe accident, and John was only 10% at fault, but Betty would still be ableto recover $1,000 (her damages reduced by 90%).

You are entitled to recover the Fair Market Value of your propertythat was destroyed in the accident. Fair Market Value is what a willing buyerwould pay a willing seller for the property immediately before the accident. Factors that go into this determination include the year, make, mileage,previous damage and general condition of your vehicle prior to the accident. There are various sources of information to help determine Fair MarketValue, such as: The Kelly Blue Book The NADA Used Car Guide Computerized market guides Recent sales of similar vehicles Ads from newspaper or auto trader magazines Asking or sales prices from dealers. Service receipts, repair receipts and maintenance records are usefulwhen trying to establish the value of your car. It is important to have theseavailable when negotiating the value of your vehicle with the insurance company. Property damage includes damage to your vehicle, its contents, even clothingyou were wearing in the accident. To claim compensation for damaged or destroyedproperty, you must be able to show that the property was actually damagedin the accident. It will also be necessary to prove the fair market valueof destroyed property. Who Pays to Fix My Car? You can submit a claim for property damage compensation to the insurancecompany of the driver who was at fault in the accident. Usually, that companywill pay for the damage to your vehicle and other property lost, destroyedor damaged in the accident, unless they are contesting who was at fault inthe accident. If you do this, be very careful that any release you signpertains only to property damage, and does not affect any injury claim youmay have. It is advisable to have an attorney review ANY release documentor settlement check before signing or cashing. Alternatively, you may submit a claim to your own insurance carrier forthe damage to your vehicle. You can generally do this only if your policyincludes "collision" coverage on the vehicle. The main advantage of having your insurance company pay a property damageclaim is that it may pay this claim more quickly than the at-fault driver'sinsurance company. If your own insurance company pays the claim, it maybe reimbursed at a later time by the at-fault driver's insurance company. It may be necessary to file a claim with your own insurance company underthe following circumstances: The accident was with a hit-and-run driver. The insurance coverage of the person at fault is not enough to coveryour damages. The at-fault driver had no insurance coverage. Even if you settle with your own insurance company, you can stillseek reimbursement from the at-fault driver's insurance for any deductiblesor other uncovered equipment or property damaged or destroyed in the accident. Is the Car Repairable or a Total Loss? The fair market value of a vehicle is its value immediatelybefore the accident. The salvage value is itsvalue immediately after the accident. A vehicle is considered a total loss if the repair cost PLUS salvage valueis more than its fair market value. If the vehicle is not a total loss bythis standard, then the insurance company will generally pay to have yourcar repaired. The insurance company usually will obtain bids from auto wrecking companiesthat want to buy your car for its scrap value. If your car is considereda total loss, you may be able to buy back the salvage. The salvage valueof car will be deducted from the market value of your car. In that event,you may need to apply for a salvage title from your states motor vehicledepartment. How is the Cost to Repair a Vehicle Determined? The at-fault party must pay for all reasonableand necessary repairs to your vehicle, if it is not a total loss. The insurancecompany may request that you drive your car to their repair shop to obtainan estimate of damage. If your vehicle was badly damaged, the insurancewill usually send an adjuster to inspect your vehicle at its location. Youmust provide any necessary information that they request. You should not necessarily accept their estimates, but should obtain upto three different estimates on your own. You may get your car repairedat the repair facility of your choice; you cannot be required tohave repairs made at any particular shop. However, do not beginrepairs until the insurance company has completed their inspection.

Medical bills can be paid by different means. If you have MedicalPayments ("Med Pay") or Personal Injury Protection ("PIP") coverage underyour auto policy, your insurance company may pay your medical costs, whetheryou were at fault or not in the accident. These benefits are often includedon automobile policies, but generally not on motorcycle policies. Some states,such as Washington and Oregon in our area, require that auto policies includePIP. An injured person may be able to collect PIP or Med Pay benefits fromthe insurance policy that covers the automobile they were traveling in, orin the case of a pedestrian, the automobile they were struck by. In othercases, the injured person might receive PIP or Med Pay benefits from theinsurance policy that covers their insured's automobile or an insured automobileof any member of their household. It is important to find out soon after an accident exactly what typesof benefits are available. There is no penalty for making a claim for PIPor Med Pay benefits. However, in most cases the insurance company who makespayments under PIP or Med Pay coverage will be entitled to reimbursementfrom the negligent party's insurance carrier. What Medical Expenses Are Covered? PIP and Med Pay benefits usually cover all reasonable and necessarymedical bills incurred as a result of accident related injuries. These mayinclude bills from doctors, hospitals, ambulances, physical therapists,chiropractors and prescriptions. There is always a dollar limit or time limit on how much PIP or Med Payinsurance will cover. In addition, some policies have a deductible of upto $250. Send your medical bills to the PIP or Med Pay carrier, not the negligentparty's insurance carrier. Until the claim is settled, that carrier is notunder any obligation to pay anything. What Wage Loss Is Covered? Many PIP policies (but not Med Pay) will reimburse a portion of yourlost wages. Typically, it is necessary for you to be off work for a periodof time, often 14 days. Once this time has elapsed, you may be paid yourwage loss until the maximum time period provided by the insurance policy. That maximum coverage period is frequently one year. Whether you receivepayment for the initial waiting period depends upon state law. For example,in Oregon you would receive payment for the first 14 days, but in Washingtonyou would not. The policy will also designate how your wage loss is to be calculated,and there will be a maximum dollar amount. In some cases, only 70% of wageloss is paid up to the maximum. (Any wage loss not reimbursed to you fromany PIP policy should be paid in the final settlement by the negligent party'sinsurance company.) If you have lost work as a result of an auto accident,be sure to find out what coverage may be available for you. What Other Expenses Are Covered by PIP? If you have PIP coverage and are not normally employed, you may beentitled to payment of expenses reasonably incurred for essential servicesthat you would have performed had you not been injured. These may includebabysitting, housekeeping, nursing care, etc. There is a limit to the amountper day and period of time, and again it is typically required that you firsthave been off work for a period of time, such as 14 days. What About My Losses Not Paid By PIP or Med Pay? If there are no PIP or Med Pay benefits available, or your billsexceed the amount of your coverage, health insurance may be used to pay atleast part of your medical bills. Other sources such as Medicare and Welfare,or a disability policy through your employer, may pay medical bills. In anyevent, all actual medical expenses and wage loss will be included at thetime of settlement, even if you had no PIP or Med Pay coverage. How Do I Apply for Benefits and What Documentation Is Needed? There may be three types of documentationthe adjuster needs to pay PIP or Med Pay benefits: A completed Application for Benefits form. The insurance carriershould send you this form. Fully complete, sign and return it to the insurancecarrier. The form contains an authorization for release of information, whichallows the insurance carrier to obtain medical bills and reports from yourdoctors to verify that their bills are related to the automobile accident.By signing this authorization, you do not release your rights to an injuryclaim. A doctor's note stating that you are unable to perform your job and thelength of time you are released from work due to your injuries. A wage loss form from your employer. The adjuster needs to know yourrate of pay and the number of hours a week you work in order to compute yourwage loss benefits. If you are self-employed, insurance adjusters will askto see your business records and tax returns. Check with your insurance company or agent to determine their exactrequirements. If your medical bills and wage loss remain unpaid even thoughyou have PIP or Med Pay coverage which should apply, arbitration can oftenbe requested. A panel of arbitrators then decides your rightful claim.

This includes both income lost due to time spent unable to work,and time missed because you were undergoing treatment for your injuries.You have the same right to recover whether you work full-time, part-time,or are self-employed. You may be entitled wage loss reimbursement even if you receive sick pay,vacation pay or disability pay. This is because you would have been entitledto use that sick leave or vacation time for other periods when you mighthave needed or wanted it. Therefore, using sick leave or vacation pay isoften considered the same as losing the pay itself. In addition to time lost from work, you may be entitled to be reimbursedfor work opportunities you lost due to your injuries. Proving a lost opportunity(such as a job interview or a promotion) is much more difficult than showingactual time loss from work. However, even if you cannot verify or quantifythis in a dollar amount, that lost potential income or opportunity may stilladd to the value of your claim. How much the value is increased depends onhow strong your proof is, and how much income that lost opportunity mighthave generated. It is important to remember that you must have medicalauthorization to be off work. It is generally not sufficient thatyou decide you don't feel up to a job; get your treating doctor's statementthat you are to spend that time recovering from your injuries. DOCUMENTING THE CLAIM The type of documentation required will depend upon how you wereemployed and whether you are submitting a PIP claimfor wage loss. The following information should give you some guidelines. If You Are Regularly Employed by a Company If you are regularly employed by someone else, verification is fairlysimple. Have your employer write a letter on company stationery. The lettershould include the following information: Your name. Your job duties or position. Rate of pay (salary and/or hourly wage rate prior to the injury). Number of hours you normally work & number of hours or days you missedfollowing the accident. (Include days or partial days. You do not need toindicate whether you used vacation time, sick leave, or a leave of absence.) The insurance company may want some additional verification, butthis will be a good start. In addition, be sure to get your doctor's statementindicating the specific dates you were not able to work due to your injuriesfrom the accident. If You Are Self-Employed, or Not Regularly Employed If you are self-employed or not regularly employed, proving lostincome is more difficult, and the insurance company will definitely requiremore detailed documentation. You need to be able to prove net loss ofearnings, which is gross income less expenses. In other words, if youare a contractor who is unable to work for three months following an autoaccident, and you would have had gross income of $30,000 and expenses of$17,000 (cost of materials, labor, etc.), then your net loss of earningsis $13,000. Carefully document how much time you were unable to work, what your grossearnings would have been had you been able to work, and what your expenseswould have been. The insurance company will most likely require tax returnsfor the past 2 or 3 years. If you had been working consistently before the accident, you can showan average for the period by putting together copies of billing statements,invoices, payments received or other evidence of income earned. You may needto include letters from individuals indicating your services would have beenused had you been able to work. From this information you can calculate howmuch income you lost for the time you were unable to work due to injuries. If your work income fluctuates during the year, you may be able to documentthe value of lost work time by showing what you normally earn during an entireyear, then dividing into weekly or monthly averages. However, if the workis seasonal, you will need to take that into account. If your income was particularly low after the accident due to your injuries,you can demonstrate how much you normally earned by using several years oftax returns. In any event, be sure to get your doctor's statement indicating the specificdates you were not able to work due to your injuries from the accident.

How Much Is My Injury ClaimWorth? Every accident claim is different and must be evaluated on the basisof the specific facts of that claim. Everyone has seen large jury awardsin the headlines. These cases involve serious injuries associated withconsiderable pain and suffering. However, large settlements or jury awardsmake up an extremely small percentage of cases. Many times large jury awardsare reduced either on appeal or in a negotiated settlement following thejury verdict. If you are injured in an automobile accident caused by another, you areentitled to recover the following: Income Loss Medical Expenses General Damages (including Pain and Suffering) Income Loss If you miss work due to the accident, you are entitled to recoveryour lost wages. You are also entitled to recoverlost wages for time you miss due to treatment for your injuries. The rightto be reimbursed for lost wages applies whether you have a full-time or part-timejob, regular or occasional employment. Using up sick leave or vacation pay is considered the same as losing thepay itself since you would have been entitled to use the vacation time orsick leave at another time of your choice. If you are self employed, it becomes little more difficult todocument your wage loss. However, you are stillentitled to be compensated for your loss of net earnings caused by the accident. Medical Expenses You are entitled to recover reasonable medicalexpenses incurred as a result of accident related injuries. These expensesmay include prescriptions, doctor bills, hospital bills, ambulance bills,treatment by physical therapists, and other medical providers. (Medicalexpenses and wage loss are sometimes referred to as "economic damages.") General Damages General damages is a term used to describe compensation for painand suffering, permanent disability and emotional damages. (Sometimes itis called "noneconomic damages.") Pain and suffering is a very subjectivepart of a claim, and opinions about the value are even more subjective. Werely on many factors in estimating the value of a claim. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING A CLAIM There are numerous variables which can make a claim worth more orless money for purposes of settlement. While most claims settle without alawsuit being filed, or a case going to trial, part of evaluating a claimis based on projecting what the outcome of a jury trial would be, so we attemptto determine what the probable jury verdict would be if the case went tocourt. Although jury awards can vary significantly, there are special factorsused to determine the likely jury award and the settlement value of yourclaim. All of these factors must be evaluated together to estimate the valueof a case. Not every factor applies in each case. Also, please note that the followingvariables are not listed in order of importance. State and County Where The Case Will Be Tried Generally, lawsuits are filed in the state and county where the accidentoccurred or where the defendant resides. Where the case is tried frequentlyinfluences the size of the jury award. You may have heard, for example, of the high jury awards in the stateof California. By comparison, jury awards in the Pacific Northwest tend tobe smaller. Similarly, jury verdicts within each state vary by county. Juryawards tend to be higher in larger metropolitan areas such as Portland, Seattleor Boise than they are in the smaller, more rural counties. A jury may award$10,000 in a large county but only $6,000 in a smaller county, even thoughthe facts of the case are basically the same. We believe the reason for this is the make up of the jury. Jurors fromlarger cities tend to receive higher incomes than jurors in smaller towns.They are, therefore, more likely to award a higher verdict. Trial vs. Arbitration When a claim against the driver who caused the accident does notsettle through out-of-court negotiation, a jury will usually decide the casein a trial. A six or twelve person jury (much like what you have seen ontelevision or in the movies) then determines the value of your case. In other claims, a jury is not involved. When a claim is made under aclient's own uninsured or underinsured motorist policy, the policy usuallyrequires the dispute be resolved by arbitration rather than a jury trial.In arbitration, a decision is made either by a single arbiter both sidesagree upon, or by three arbiters. In that event, we select one arbiter,the insurance company another, and the two arbiters agree on a third. The arbiters are usually judges or lawyers. They will hear the evidenceand decide your case. Arbitration is less expensive for the insurance companythan a jury trial because an arbitration requires less time and less moneyin lawyer fees to defend the claim. The plaintiff usually has lower costsin arbitrating as case as well. Generally, jury awards are higher than arbitration awards. Jurors tendto identify more with accident victims and be more emotional than arbiterswho may have seen many similar cases. However, there is always a risk thata jury award can be disappointingly low. Other problems with jury trialsis the length of time until a case is decided and the inconsistency of juryawards. After a lawsuit is filed, it can be over a year until the trial takesplace. Although an arbitration generally means lower injury awards, the awardsare usually more consistent and quicker to obtain. Likeability of Plaintiff and Defendant Your likeability is another factor. A sincere and honest claimantelicits more sympathy than one who appears abrasive, difficult or greedy.Similarly, the likeability of the defendant is important. What kind of impressiondoes he or she make? Does he or she have a chip on their shoulder or arethey very remorseful that the accident happened? If the accident happenedbecause the defendant was drunk, a jury could award you more money in orderto punish the negligent driver and make a point that drunk driving is nottolerated. Juries tend to award more money to plaintiffs they like and punishnegative behavior by defendants. A jury is more likely to be sympathetic to your claim if they believeyou are presenting an accurate picture of the accident and not exaggeratingyour injuries. Objective vs. Subjective Injuries Jury awards are higher for clients who have "objective" injuriescompared to those clients who have "subjective" injuries. Objective injuriescan be verified in a way other than the client's complaints. For example,a broken leg can be verified by an x-ray. The jury can be shown the x-rayand see the fracture themselves. In these cases, the jury will generallybelieve that an injury exists. Many injuries arising from auto accidents are subjective. These are theinjuries a client describes to the doctor, such as, "My neck is stiff andsore." It is difficult to objectively verify these injuries since musclestrains or sprains cannot be seen on x-ray. A jury or a panel of arbitersmight feel that an injury is exaggerated when there are no objective findingsto support the injured person's complaints. This is not to say that the plaintiffis not injured, as muscular injuries can be very troublesome and long lasting.However, the plaintiff always runs the risk that a jury may not believe thatan injury exists or that it is less severe than the client describes. Another factor may be whether your doctor prescribes medications. Forexample, the need for pain or anti-inflammatory medication indicates theinjured victim is suffering from pain, inflammation or other symptoms. Thetype of medication and length of use may indicate seriousness of suffering. Permanent Injuries / Disability Awards for permanent injuries are greater than awards for injuriesthat diminish with time. Generally, the longer it takes to recover, the greaterthe award. We would expect a jury to award more in a neck injury case whereit takes two years for a client to recover than one that has a recovery periodof two months. Larger jury awards occur in cases where a doctor testifies the clienthas permanent injuries that will last for the rest of the client's life.It is not enough for the client to predict they will suffer the rest of theirlife. The court will require that prediction to be substantiated by a medicalexpert. Type of Injury Soft tissue: Soft tissue injuries are the most common injuriesfrom auto accidents and include sprains and strains of the muscles and/orligaments of the neck, back, shoulder, knees or other parts of the body.Insurance companies consider sprains and strains less serious because theyare not usually expected to be permanent or life-impairing, regardless ofhow painful they may be. Also, sprains and strains are difficult to provebecause they are not visible and cannot be objectively verified by x-ray. Dislocations, separations, and ligament or cartilage tears: Theseinjuries can cause more pain and have a longer recovery time than a strainor sprain. Even when the healing time and pain is the same as a sprain, theseinjuries are generally considered more serious. Fractures: There are many types of fractures. If an x-ray showseven a minor fracture of a bone, including a chip or crack, the value ofthe claim increases. The particular bone that is fractured and the seriousnessof the fracture influences the amount of the recovery. As an example, a personwith a fractured rib may return to a desk job, whereas a person with a fracturedarm who is employed as a construction worker may be unable to work for severalmonths. Spinal disc or vertebrae injury: If the accident results in eithera herniated or bulging disc of the neck or back, a spinal nerve may be affected. X-rays, an MRI or other diagnostic imaging tests can reveal an abnormalityeither in a disc or in the space between vertebrae. Disc injuries may requirelong periods of conservative care or ultimately, surgery. Discomfort or lackof mobility may persist or recur as a person gets older. The degree and extentof injury, type of treatment, and time of recovery influences the value ofspinal injuries. Wounds and scars: Any tear or cut serious enough to require treatment,including stitches, increases the value of a claim. If the wound leaves apermanent scar, the value increases even more. The value can vary substantiallybetween the facial scarring of a young female, and scarring that is not normallyvisible on an older male. Also considered is whether the scar can be surgicallyrevised, and what impact the scar has on the person's life: facial scarringon a model would be valued higher due to the effect on his or her career. Amputations, brain damage, and catastrophic injuries: Amputationsinclude the removal of a fingertip or an entire limb. A brain injury canaffect certain mental and bodily functions, or leave a person totallyincapacitated. The effects of these injuries may last a long time and caneven recur after recovery seems to be complete. Paralysis usually resultsfrom spinal cord damage. These injuries result in lifetime medical treatmentand loss of earning capacity. These claims have a high value. Wrongful death: Physical and emotional suffering before death,the accident victim's occupation, age, sex, and marital status influencethe value of this type of claim. These claims have substantial value. Psychological damage: Injuries can cause depression, stress, andtension among family members. The relationship between psychological damageand physical injuries is now becoming more accepted. However, in order toclaim psychological damage, a psychologist or other therapist must be involvedin the diagnosis and treatment of the condition. Effects on Work and Lifestyle Jury awards are higher when injuries have a permanent effect on aclient's life than when there are only short term effects. If injuries causea client to be unable to work (or need retraining for a new job) jury awardsare higher than in cases where injuries affect a client's ability to engagein sports or recreational activities. Diagnosis of Injuries Injuries must be diagnosed before treatment can begin. Most injuriesare simple to diagnose and the charge for diagnostic services is a smallpercentage of the total medical bills. Sometimes, numerous costly tests areperformed before a diagnosis is made. In these cases, the insurance companymay not view the total medical expenses as accurately reflecting the injuredvictim's pain and suffering. Type and Effectiveness of Treatment Insurance companies, and to a lesser extent, juries, tend to favormainstream Western medical treatment over alternative medical practitioners.Alternative practitioners (including chiropractors, naturopaths, massagetherapists, acupuncturists, acupressurists and herbalists) may be effectivein treating injuries, but normally insurance companies do not consider thistype of treatment legitimate. These expenses will probably be reimbursedby insurance companies, but you should be aware that pain and sufferingcompensation may be lower than if treatment was provided by a medical doctor,orthopedist, neurologist or prescribed physical therapist. Nonetheless, itis important for you to seek the treatment you feel comfortable with andbelieve will benefit your recovery the most. Frequency and Length of Treatment Juries usually feel that a client who is hurting from their injurieswill seek treatment. Generally, treatment that is immediate and continuesfor a long period of time until the medical provider indicates you are eitherwell or medically stable, is considered stronger evidence of injury and willbe valued at a higher amount. The insurance company views treatment of shortduration to indicate less serious injuries. A client who claims serious injuries with great effects on their homeand work life will be viewed suspiciously if the client never went to thedoctor. If treatment is not sought at all after an accident, injuries willbe regarded as minor or nonexistent. If treatment is not sought for a significantperiod of time after an accident, the claim may be viewed as suspect. On the other hand, a jury will have no sympathy for a client with minorinjuries who went to the doctor daily in order to "drum up the claim." Insurancecompanies may view long term chiropractic treatment as excessive, believingchiropractors sometimes treat more often than necessary. In other words,the insurance company will not view long periods of chiropractic treatmentas legitimate an indicator of the seriousness of an injury as the same amountof treatment with a medical doctor. Length of Recovery When evaluating pain and suffering, insurance companies will considerhow long it took for the injuries to resolve or stabilize. The higher thefrequency, severity and duration of pain, the greater the pain and suffering.The insurance company looks at whether your injury required ongoing attentionand the number of times you saw the doctor. If you keep your doctor informedabout your progress, any continuing pain, discomfort, muscle spasms, limitedrange of motion or immobility you have had, should be noted in your medicalrecords. Amount of Medical Bills Generally, the larger the amount of bills directly related to medicaltreatment, the higher the jury award, assuming the jury concludes that thetreatment was reasonable and necessary. Jury verdict research indicatesthat jury awards are higher if the medical treatment is done by medical doctors,hospitals and physical therapists versus chiropractors, naturopaths, andacupuncturists (as noted above). Amount of Wage Loss The larger the amount of verifiable wage loss the higher the juryawards. Your wage loss must be verified by youremployer or supported by your tax return. You must also have writtenauthorization from your doctor for the time you are unable to work. Amount of Property Damage Although it is certainly possible to sustain a significant injurywith relatively minor damage to your vehicle, juries tend to award largerverdicts if there is significant damage to the cars involved. Since we livein a society which is very visually oriented, a juror being able to seeproperty damage increases the likelihood that jurorwill conclude an injury has occurred.

Should I Hire AnAttorney? Does this seem familiar? It starts out seeming simple. You have an auto accident, and theinsurance adjuster for the at-fault driver is really friendly and helpfulso you begin working with her about getting payment for your car. You don'tfeel like you get top dollar, and you were kind of mad that they didn't payall of your rental car bill, but you figure you'll make up for it later whenyou settle your injury claim. You decide to go it alone and negotiate a settlement of your injury claim,so you talk with a friend who was in an accident last year, and you pickup one of the books that are out on the market about handling your own injuryclaim. That should be all you need. The insurance company wants you to give them a recorded statement, andyou're not sure if that's right, but you go ahead. Then some issues comeup about PIP coverage, and calculating your lost wages. Next thing you know,the insurance company wants you to be examined by a doctor they choose. You'renot certain what to do, but you figure it will all work out in the end, soyou go ahead, but then they tell you that they won't pay any more of yourmedical bills. After a couple of months your back still hurts some, but you want to settleand get this behind you. The medical bills keep coming, and you are gettingpast due notices, so you get the insurance company to make you an offer. Then it occurs to you that you have a lot of nagging concerns, and don'tknow where to turn. Should I settle now even though my back still hurts? What about future medical bills? What if I miss more work when I have to go back to physical therapy? Was it right that the adjuster told me they didn't have to pay for mychiropractic care?

If there is no recovery,there are no attorney fees. Attorney fees charged for auto accident cases vary among law firms. Therefore,it pays to shop around to find not only an experienced lawyer to handle yourclaim, but also a law firm that charges a competitive contingency fee. Asan example, some law firms charge 33% of the total money recovery if thecase is settled without a trial; 40% if a trial occurs; and 50% if thereis an appeal of the claim. Our firm negotiates each fee based on thecomplexity of the case and the factual circumstances. The bottom line is to find an experienced lawyer with reasonable attorneyfees. After all, you, the accident victim, deserve the lion's share of thesettlement, not the lawyers. What Are the Costs Involved in Auto Accident Claims? All law firms pass on charges to accident victims for court costsand costs to obtain the client's medical records and reports. In order tosettle your claim, we will need to obtain a copy of your hospital and doctorrecords. This typically costs $15 to $30 per medical provider. Also, a doctor'sreport is needed to determine if you will have any continuing disabilities.The cost for doctors' reports varies, but are generally between $75 - $150. Most claims settle out of court, but if a lawsuit is necessary, there is usually a filing fee of approximately $100 to $200.Other court costs may include the cost to serve the court papers on thedefendant, deposition fees and expert witness fees. If the claim goes throughtrial, the total costs average $2,000 to $3,000 for a simple case with thetestimony of one doctor, and can be much higher. Some law firmsask the client to pay a retainer (money paid in advance) to cover these costs.Other firms ask the client to pay these costs as they occur, and still othersallow the client to wait to pay the costs until the settlement is received. At Michaelsen Mix & Rodrigues, L.L.C., we normally will advance thesecosts.

ADR refers to efforts to find methodswhich are outside the court system to resolve civil disputes. These methodsmay be advantageous to the courts and to the parties involved since theymay resolve a dispute in a faster, more cost-effective manner and reduceor eliminate the need for participation by the court system. In many states, and within the federal court system, the number of civilcases continues to grow annually. However, the resources necessary to handlethe increasing case load - primarily judges and court staff - are not keepingpace. The result is a heavier work load for existing personnel and longerwaiting periods between the time a civil lawsuit isfiled and the trial of that case. The criminal caseload continues to grow in most jurisdictions. Sincecriminal cases generally have priority, based in part on a constitutionalright to a speedy trial, the effect on civil cases (such as personal injuryclaims arising from auto accidents) is to delay them even longer. The courts have tried employing various methods of ADR. The most commontypes of ADR are arbitration and mediation. In addition, various private companies have sprung up over the last fewyears in many areas with active ADR policies to provide these necessary services. Arbitration Arbitration is a process by which one or three individuals, oftenlawyers, serve as "judges" to decide a case. It is a mini-trial, often heldin a conference room or other neutral location, in which evidence is presentedto the arbitrator(s) much as if in a courtroom. There are many differenttypes of arbitration procedures. Arbitration can be binding or non-binding. A bindingarbitration is one in which the ruling of the arbitrator is final, and oftencan become a judgment, just as if the case were tried before a judge or jury.For example, many contracts have a provision requiring binding arbitration,so that if a dispute arises between the parties to the contract which cannotbe worked out voluntarily, they have agreed in advance to have it decidedby arbitration, rather that through a lawsuit. Non-binding arbitration goes through the same mini-trial procedure, butthe ruling of the arbitrator(s) does not eliminate the losing party's rightto go to court and have the case decided by a judge or jury. For example,some courts now have a procedure in which "smaller" civil cases (such ascases involving less than a dollar amount, like $25,000) are required togo to non-binding arbitration. Although the losing side can still go tocourt, in practice the vast majority of cases are resolved by non-bindingarbitration do not re-enter the court system. The number and selection of arbiters differs considerably. Sometimesthe parties to an arbitration are required to agree on a single arbitrator. Frequently, however, such agreement is difficult, and so procedures havebeen established to select a three arbiter panel. For example, in a civilcase, the plaintiff might select one arbitrator and the defendant would selecta second. The two arbiters selected would then get together and pick a third,or "swing," arbiter. Three arbiter panels typically decide cases by a majorityvote. It is important to note that most insurance policies in which PIP or nofault benefits are provided have provisions that disputes be subject to bindingarbitration. Similarly, uninsured and underinsured motorist disputes arisingunder auto policies are frequently arbitrated. However, some recent courtdecisions question whether an individual, or an insurance company, can bedeprived of the constitutional right to a jury trial and forced to arbitratethese issues. Mediation Mediation involves the use of a neutral third party to assist inbringing about a voluntary resolution of a dispute. The mediator does not"decide" the case. Instead, a good mediator tries to find common groundin a dispute and encourages both sides to reach that common ground. Because the nature of mediation is to sit down face to face to try toreach a voluntary agreement, it is usually necessary that everyone involvedbe present - individuals, attorneys, insurance adjusters, etc. However,it is usually not required that a defendant who has insurance be presentif the insurance company has full authority to settle the claim. For example, in an auto accident case, plaintiff may be asking for $30,000for her injuries, but the insurance company is only willing to offer $20,000. The mediator may talk to the insurance adjuster and the insurance attorneyand point out the strengths of the plaintiff's case, the risks and costsassociated with the insurance company going to trial, and the advantagesof settling the particular case. Similarly, a good mediator will talk tothe plaintiff and her attorney about risks and costs of trial and the weaknessesin the case. When parties are open to discussion, often a settlement canbe reached on some middle ground which all sides find acceptable. Because any resolution as a result of mediation is voluntary among theparties, it will be a binding settlement.

Often that canbe achieved through settlement negotiations and without the need for filinga lawsuit. We generally recommend exploring settlement opportunities beforegoing to court. However, a lawsuit may be your only legal remedy if you are unable toobtain an acceptable settlement. Sometimes there is a question ofwho was at fault in an auto accident, or sometimesthere is simply a difference of opinion between the injured person and theinsurance company for the responsible driver regarding thesettlement value of a claim. In these cases, it is important to have the help of an experienced attorneyin the litigation process. How long can I wait to start a lawsuit? Every state has its own "statute of limitations," which is the legal time limit for filing a lawsuit after the date of theaccident. The length of time ranges from one year (California, Kentucky,Louisiana and Tennessee) to six years (Maine and North Dakota). In addition, sometimes there are very short notice requirements, suchas when a claim may be made against a State, City or County. In such cases,it may be necessary to file a formal Notice of Claim in as little time as30-60 days after a motor vehicle accident. Therefore, it is essential thatanybody with an auto accident claim seek legal advice as to the statute oflimitations and notice requirements that will apply in their case. Waiting too long can mean losing all your rights to ever make aclaim for your injuries. Do I have to have an attorney to file a lawsuit? No, an attorney is not required. Thereare, however, a number of things that you must consider if you decide torepresent yourself. You need to be certain that you have named all possibledefendants, and that you have included all possible causes of action. Forexample, in addition to the driver of the vehicle that injured you, theremay be a claim against the driver's business, or the owner of the car, ora tavern where the driver had been drinking. If you do not include all yourclaims, they may be lost forever. In addition, you can be certain that, if the defendant had insurance,the insurance company will hire an experienced attorney to oppose your lawsuit,and that can make it very difficult to navigate the complex litigation processon your own. It is also hard for someone not experienced in these mattersto decide when it is appropriate to settle and for how much. If I start a lawsuit, does it mean that the case will go to trial? Not necessarily. The majority of cases can still be settled, evenafter a lawsuit is begun. Statistically, fewer than one in five cases inwhich a lawsuit is filed actually goes to court for a full trial. The restare settled at some point along the way. What other methods are available to resolve this claim without goingto court? Many jurisdictions now provide for arbitration or mediation, andother non-court types of resolution procedures. These are referred to asalternative dispute resolution options. The use ofthese options is expanding rapidly to attempt to reduce some of the pressureon the court system. THE EARLY STAGES OF A LAWSUIT Filing the Complaint A lawsuit is initiated by the filing of a document called a "complaint"in the appropriate court. The injured person is called the "plaintiff,"and the plaintiff, or the plaintiff's attorney, files the complaint. Thedefendant is the person who caused the accident; note that the suit is usuallynot against the insurance company. The lawsuit is usually filed inthe county where the accident occurred, or where the defendant lives. Therewill be a fee paid at the time the complaint is filed, often in the $100to $200 range. The complaint will be in the form required by the particular court andwill generally set forth the following: Time, date and location of accident Description of the accident Name of all defendants who were at fault Nature of the plaintiff's injuries Amount of plaintiff's medical bills Amount of plaintiff's wage loss Amount sought by plaintiff for "general damages"(for "pain and suffering") Service of the Complaint At the time the complaint is filed, a case number is issued. Asummons is then prepared and personally delivered to each defendantalong with a copy of the complaint. This procedure is calledservice of the lawsuit. The summons will include the case number,name the plaintiff and each defendant, and direct the defendant to filea formal response (usually a document called an "answer") with the propercourt within a specific length of time. The law usually allows between 20and 30 days for a defendant to respond from the date the summons and complaintare served. If the defendant has no insurance, he/she should turn the complaint overto an attorney. If there is insurance, then the insurance company shouldget a copy, and they will hire an attorney. The attorney will then filethe appropriate response with the court. If nothing is filed within therequired time, plaintiff may take a "default" against the defendant and couldend up obtaining a judgment. Filing the Answer The answer may contain one or more the following: A general denial of the claim Admissions that some of the allegations in the complaint are true, butothers are not (for example, a defendant might admit that he hit the plaintiff'scar, but deny that the plaintiff was injured) An "affirmative defense," such as a claim that plaintiff was also atfault in causing the accident or that the statute oflimitations had run before the complaint was filed A "counterclaim," which is a claim back against the plaintiff A "cross claim," which is a claim against another defendant A "third party claim," which is a claim against another person or companywho was not originally named in the lawsuit THE MIDDLE STAGES OF A LAWSUIT - DISCOVERY Discovery is the process by which each side finds out muchof the information the other side has. It is a formal investigation whereineach side gathers evidence to prepare its case. The days of "trial by ambush,"in which neither side knows what the other is going to do until trial actuallybegins, are largely over. Now, both sides have fairly broad access toinformation to prepare their cases. The process of discovery is governed by local rules of court procedure,and every jurisdiction is different. Interrogatories may be exchanged bythe parties in the dispute in order to find out the facts. Depositions maybe taken. Doctors and witnesses may be interviewed. Medical records and wageloss verification may be requested through the use of procedures such as"requests for production." Furthermore, the defendant may ask that the plaintiffbe examined by a doctor defendant chooses. The reason for discovery is to get to the truth by making sure that bothside have all the information regarding the accident and resulting injuries.Many times settlement of the claim is possible after the discovery processis complete, since it forces everyone to try to accurately evaluate the strengthsand weaknesses of their case. Depositions The law may allow the testimony (deposition)of the parties and witnesses to be taken before the trial. In a deposition,the plaintiff, defendant, doctor or other witness is sworn to tell the truth,and questions are then asked by the attorneys in the presence of a courtreporter who takes down all of the testimony. Your attorney will be presentat all times during a deposition. What is said at a deposition can laterbe used at the trial. Interrogatories Interrogatories are written questions that each attorney may prepareand give to the other side to be answered under oath. The answers are consideredsworn testimony, just as if given during a trial. Not every jurisdictionpermits the use of interrogatories. Requests for Production Each lawyer will probably serve requests for production of documentson the other lawyer. These requests compel the other side to provide documents,such as medical records or photographs. Independent Medical Examinations The insurance company for the defendant may request that a plaintiffbe examined by a doctor chosen by the insurance company. This is called anIndependent Medical Examination or IME. The court will usually require thata plaintiff attend this exam. If the case goes to trial, the IME doctorcan come in and testify about his or her findings in the exam. THE LAST STAGE - TRIAL Trial Date At some point a trial date will be assigned. This means that yourcase will be placed on the court calendar. The court calendar is a list ofdates on which cases which are ready for trial will be heard. The date oftrial may be several months away, or even a year or two away, depending onwhat county (jurisdiction) your case was filed in. Each jurisdiction is different about when they assign trial dates, andhow long it takes to get to trial. You could wait as little as six monthsfrom the time your complaint is filed to actually begin trial of your case,to as long as five years in some large urban areas. Even though a trialdate is received, it is common that set-overs be requested. They can berequested by either side. Typically the reasons are that discovery is notcompleted, or one of the attorneys or a party has a conflict with anothermatter. Settlement Conferences Frequently one of the parties will request a settlement conferenceprior to trial. In some jurisdictions, such conferences are mandatory; thecourt wants to make sure a good effort has been made to settle the case beforecommitting the court's resources to a trial. At the settlement conference, a judge will meet with the parties and theirattorneys to try to reach a settlement. It will usually not be the samejudge who would preside over the trial if the case does not settle. The judge will often take an active role in trying to get the two sidesto reach a negotiated settlement. He/she may suggest possible compromisesby actually placing a dollar value on the case and encouraging a plaintiff to accept a settlement offer. Conversely, the settlement judge may alsoseek to encourage an insurance company to offer more money in settlement. The approach will be based on the particular facts and the judge's experiencein presiding over jury trials in that jurisdiction. If settlement is not reached at this time, the case will usually go totrial. Trial Procedure in a Nutshell Jury Selection Although it is not required, most personal injury cases are triedto a jury. In a jury case, the first step is to obtain a jury that canbe fair and impartial. Traditionally, juries are made up of twelve individuals,although many courts use six jurors. Jurors are selected at random fromthe community using public records such as voter registration or driverslicense information. After a jury "panel" of perhaps 20 potential jurors has been sent tothe courtroom from a waiting area, the first step is to question prospectivejurors to determine whether they can be fair and impartial. The judge andthe attorneys on each side have the right to question jurors and may askthat a juror be excused "for cause" if the juror is biased or otherwiseindicates he/she cannot fairly decide the case. In addition, each side has certain "peremptory challenges" which permitthem to excuse a limited number of jurors without giving a reason. Opening Statements After selection of the jury, each attorney has the opportunity tomake an opening statement to the jury. This statement describes what thecase is about, gives a preview of what evidence will be presented, and basicallyoutlines the nature of the argument for the jury. The trial begins by plaintiff's attorney addressing the jury. Next, anopening statement is generally made by defendant's attorney, although thedefense attorney is permitted to waive his opening statement and wait untilthe plaintiff's case is completed before addressing the jury. Presentation of Evidence The presentation of evidence begins after the opening statements. Plaintiff's attorney will present evidence first, followed by the defense. Evidence consists of the testimony of witnesses and exhibits which the courtallows into evidence. All evidence must be legally admissible. Complex rules of evidence governwhat is legally admissible, and disputes between the attorneys are resolvedby the trial judge. These evidentiary rulings are important because theyhelp determine what the jury will consider in arriving at their verdict,and errors by the judge in his or her ruling on evidence questions may providethe basis for a later appeal of the verdict. There are two types of evidence which can be presented. Testimonyis oral evidence on any relevant matter given by a witness who is under oath.Physical evidence includes all other types of evidence such as medicalrecords, x-rays, tax returns, and photographs which the trial judge allowsthe jury to consider. In order to support their position, each side calls witnesses to testify.They may be either " lay" or "expert" witnesses. A lay witness mayhave knowledge of relevant facts, such as an eyewitness to an accident or a spouse who testifies to plaintiff's physical limitations from the accident. A witness who has knowledge or special training not generally known by thegeneral public would be considered an expert witness. For example,a physician would be considered an expert witness because of his medicalknowledge. After the plaintiff's case has been presented, the defense has the rightto make a motion (a request) to the judge to dismiss the case on the basisthat a case has not been sufficiently established. This would be based ondefense's contention that plaintiff has not shown enough evidence to supportthe claim. Plaintiff has the burden of proof. This means that a plaintiffmust provide evidence to support each and every claim he or she is making.By making the motion to dismiss, defendant is asking the judge to rule thatthere has been insufficient evidence presented and that, as a matter oflaw, the jury could not rule in the plaintiff's favor. If the judge rulesthat the plaintiff has not met the minimum requirement of proof, the judgewill grant the motion to dismiss the case. If the judge decides that enoughevidence has been presented, defendant's motion will be denied and the trialwill continue. Next up is the defendant's attorney, who will introduce testimony fromwitnesses and other evidence, the object of which is to disprove the claimspresented by the plaintiff. When this process is completed, that is, whenall the defendant's evidence has been introduced, the defendant's attorneywill rest his case. At this point, the plaintiff has the right to bring in rebuttal witnesses. The purpose of these witnesses is only to refute specific evidence introducedby the defendant. Closing Argument After both sides rest their cases, each is permitted to address thejury in a closing argument or summation. This is a final attempt to influencethe jury's verdict by reviewing the evidence and by using the art of persuasion.In most states, the plaintiff argues first, then the defendant argues, andthen the plaintiff offers a rebuttal. Jury Instructions After the summations (or sometimes before them) the judge will instructthe jury - that is, the judge will inform the jury of the law applicablein the case and how to apply the facts in the to that law to arrive at averdict. The attorneys for both sides usually propose jury instructions andargue to the judge, without the jury present, about what instructions shouldbe given to the jury before the jury is charged. Errors in jury instructionscan result in a case being overturned on appeal and retried, so the attorneysand judge are usually very thorough about the language of jury instructions. Verdict After the members of the jury have heard the evidence, heard thearguments of the attorneys, and been instructed as to the law of the case,it is left up to them to reach a verdict. They will decide if the defendantwas at fault in causing the motor vehicle accident and, if so, how much moneythe plaintiff is be awarded in compensation. The jury retires to a jury room, where the case is discussed. A presidingjuror, sometimes called a "foreman," is selected to guide the jurydeliberations, but does not have any greater vote than any of the other jurors. In some jurisdictions a unanimous decision is required for a verdict ina civil case involving personal injuries. In others, the decision need notbe unanimous. For instance, a five-to-one vote may be a legal verdict ona six-person jury, and a ten-to-two (or sometimes nine-to-three) vote ona twelve person jury. Some Notes on Courtroom Conduct During a trial, the same items listed above under how to conductyourself during a deposition apply to your presencein court. Most important is behaving in a respectful manner to everyone andanswer questions truthfully. The following are additional tips: Be in court and attend every day of the trial. If you do not, thejury may your absence as uncaring about your case. Do not be late for court. Be polite, courteous and dress appropriately at all times. The jurorsare watching you! Do not attempt to communicate in any way with your attorney or anyoneelse while testimony is being given or when the court is being addressedby your attorney. Do not argue with your attorney or anyone else in the view of the juryor judge. Take notes during the proceedings so that you can bring up anyconcerns later to your attorney. During your testimony, if your attorney objects to a question asked ofyou, do not answer until the judge instructs you to answer. Do not attempt to communicate with any juror at any time. Be sure you speak clearly and speak loud enough to be heard. APPEAL If the verdict of the jury goes against you, you may have the rightto an appeal to a higher court. This is true whether you are the plaintiffor the defendant. In order to appeal, there must be an error of lawby the judge. This may be a ruling on evidence questions, or motions, orjury instructions. However, it is important to remember that in generalyou cannot appeal the findings of fact made by a jury. Appellate procedures differ considerably between jurisdictions. In general,it is a process by which legal arguments are made in written documents calledbriefs, then argued orally before the appropriate appellate court. The appealis not a place to present witnesses or evidence; the appeals court reviewsonly the record made at trial. The record consists of the evidence,the exhibits, and any other proceedings taken down by the court reporter.

What Is a Deposition? A deposition is oral testimony taken under oath before a trial orarbitration. It is customary that depositions be taken of the parties toa lawsuit. Often depositions are also taken of witnesses and others whomight testify at trial. Even though it often takes place in a conferenceroom or office, and the setting is somewhat informal, it is a very importantevent in any lawsuit. The questions you will be asked pertain to information relevant to yourautomobile accident case. For example, you will be asked about your medical,employment and educational background, and about the accident and your injuries. Your deposition will probably take between one and two hours, although thelength can vary considerably. Your attorney will review your testimony before the deposition and willbe there with you when you are questioned by the other attorney. There willalso be a court reporter present, taking down everything you say, so it isimportant that you be as accurate and truthful as possible. Purpose of a Deposition A deposition is part of what is called the "discovery" process ofa lawsuit. The deposition allows the lawyer on theother side to "discover" all the facts a witness may know which will assistthat lawyer in preparing for the trial or arbitration of a case. It mayalso be the only opportunity the other lawyer has to evaluate you as a witness. Once both sides are fully aware of all the relevant facts, it is often possibleto settle a case. If your case goes to court, all the lawyers will have a booklet preparedby the court reporter which contains the questions and answers from yourdeposition. Those answers may be read back to you and to the jury. It isessential that your testimony at your deposition be just as complete andtruthful as if you were testifying in a courtroom. Your Appearance You should remember that this deposition is probably the firstopportunity the other attorney has to meet you. A claims adjuster from theinsurance company may also be present as an observer during the deposition. You will be judged upon such things as your appearance, demeanor, honesty,frankness and possible jury appeal. It is important that you make a good impression. Therefore, you shouldappear for your deposition dressed as you would expect to dress if you wereactually going to court to appear before the jury. Remember to: Be clean. Wear neat clothing. Treat all persons in the deposition room with respect Some Do's and Don'ts of Being An Effective Witness DO: Tell the truth. Never attempt to lie to protect yourself orenhance your case by exaggeration. Be humble and respectful: "Yes, sir" or "No, sir" are not required,but you may find such responses helpful in setting a polite tone. Speak slowly and clearly. Answer out loud and with words, not by shakingyour head meaning "yes" or "no," or saying "uh-huh" or "uh-uh." The courtreporter must be able to understand you to make an accurate record.Wait until the lawyer finishes asking the question before you begin toanswer. The court reporter can only record one person talking at a time! Be certain you understand the question before you answer. If you don'tunderstand the question, it is perfectly all right to ask that it be repeatedor explained. Take your time and give the questions and your answers as much thoughtas is necessary. Stick to the facts and testify to only that which you personallyknow. Answer all questions directly and as concisely as possible. When youhave answered, stop talking. Testify only to basic facts, and do not attempt to give opinions or estimatesunless you have good reason for knowing such matters. Be as positive as possible. Try to avoid "I think," "I believe," "Iguess," "possibly," or "perhaps." It is better to say "As I recall," or"In my judgment." For example, "I was going 40 miles per hour" is preferableto, "I believe I was going 40 miles per hour." Admit candidly if you do not know or do not remember. Some clients thinkthey should have an answer for every question asked. You cannot know allthe facts, and you do yourself a disservice if you attempt to testify tofacts with which you are not acquainted. It is important that you be honestand straight-forward in your testimony. Sometimes "I don't know" is theperfect answer. Remember that if you start to feel tired or need a break, we can stopthe deposition. Just let your lawyer know and the deposition can stop fora few minutes. DON'T: Guess. Argue or lose your temper. Leave your temper at home. You may not likethe question or the other lawyer, but arguing or losing your temper willalmost always hurt your case. Volunteer information. Wait until the question is asked, answer it andstop. If you can answer "yes" or "no," do so and stop. Explain your answerif necessary, but don't make speeches. Say "I can't," as in "I can't play tennis now," unless you mean it. Instead, say that you "are not able to do something as well as before." Can't means physical impossibility; you may be able to play tennis, but onlywith great difficulty and pain. Look to your lawyer for help in answering a question. Your lawyer cannotanswer for you; just do the best you can. Try to memorize your story. Justice requires only that a witness tellthe story to the best of his or her ability. Rehearsed stories often soundfalse. Say "That's all I know" or "That's all of my injuries." Later, youmay remember something else, so it is more accurate to say, "That's all Irecall at this moment." If the other lawyer asks for you to tell him orher all the injuries you have, or tell him all of your activities affectedby your injuries, explain all you can remember and then add, "There may bemore, but that's all I can think of right now." Smoke or chew gum. Most Important - A Summary Listen to the question Answer only the question asked Answer the question truthfully Don't get angry Makes Lists on Paper Certain areas are sure to come up during your deposition, and youshould be prepared to talk about them as accurately as possible. Some peoplefind it helpful to make lists to refresh their recollection or put datesin order. Feel free to do so, but if you do, bring the lists with you tothe deposition and give them to your attorney before it begins. These aredocuments that we will also find useful in preparing your case. Remember, these lists are to help you and your attorney, but you may notbe able to refer to the lists or testify from them during your deposition. List all of your injuries from this accident, from the top of yourhead to your feet. Also list psychological trauma, headaches, sleep problems,fear of driving, etc. (if they apply). List all past employment you have had by date (going back at least 10years). List all significant injuries, illnesses, and medical treatments youhave had before and after this accident. List all activities you cannot do now, or have limitations doing now,that you used to do before the accident. Include how the injuries affectedday to day activities, recreation, relationships, and sports. Review of Documents You may find it helpful to review certain documents prior to thedeposition. You may review the police report and any medical records andreports you may have. However, DO NOT review your Injury Diary or other material your lawyershave provided to you in preparation for your deposition unless you areinstructed to do so. The reason is that the other lawyer may have a rightto see material you review prior to the deposition. It may not be in yourbest interests to be required to provide documents subject to the attorney-clientprivilege to the other lawyer. Other Things to Remember Come prepared to show any and all scars to the other attorney. Have with you all the facts and figures with respect to your time lostfrom work, amount of wages lost, and medical bills. Your deposition can be an important tool in enabling your attorneysto obtain a fair settlement of your case, so comewell-rested and well-prepared. If you have any questions, be sure to writethem down and discuss them with your attorney before your deposition begins.

Your insurance company may have the right to schedule you for whatis called an Independent Medical Examination, or "IME." This is a commonpractice if you are receiving Personal Injury Protection benefits, or ifyou have filed a lawsuit to receive compensation for your injuries. TheIME will involve giving a medical history and going through a physical examconducted by one or more doctors chosen by the insurance company. These examinations may be called "independent," but you should be awarethat the doctor is getting paid for the examination by the insurance company. Some doctors make a significant part of their living conducting theseexaminations for insurance companies. The PIP IME If you have Personal Injury Protection (PIP) or Med Pay benefits,your insurance company may want to get a second opinion. The obligationof the company is to pay reasonable and necessary expenses, and if the insurancecompany is concerned about the amount of your medical bills or duration ofyour ongoing treatment, they may have the right to send you to a doctor oftheir choosing. If this doctor concludes that your treatment is no longer warranted, thePIP carrier may stop paying for your medical treatment. In that event, youmay have a right to demand an arbitration or sue your insurance company. A lawyer can advise you regarding these alternatives. Before attending a PIP IME, be sure to ask your lawyer, if you have one,whether it is in your best interest to attend. If you do not attend theIME, the insurance company will probably cut off further payment of medicalbills and/or wage loss. However, in some circumstances it may be preferableto allow this to happen than to go through the IME, especially if litigationis probable. The Litigation IME If a lawsuit has already been filed, the insurance company may wantto have you examined by a doctor who would be prepared to testify in courtif the case goes to trial. The civil rules of procedure in most states allowsuch examinations, and you will be required to attend. It is probable thatthe examining doctor will reach different conclusions than your own treatingdoctor about your condition. Tips on handling any IME Here are some suggestions on how to handle an IME: Be aware that you may be observed from the moment you enter the parkinglot until the time you drive off. We see comments in the reports dealingwith how a client got out of a car or walked across the parking lot. Do not answer questions dealing with fault in the accident. You shouldanswer only those questions that are directed to medical issues. Under no circumstances should you get angry or argumentative with theexaminers. If you do, they will probably record that in their report andit will not help your case. If possible, have someone accompany you to the exam. Have that personnote how long each portion of the exam lasts. Describe your pain and medical condition truthfully and completely. Do not let the doctor trap you with questions which attribute pain to areasclearly not associated with your injury. Don't be afraid to say "Ouch" when you hurt. If you grimace and thedoctor does not see it, your reaction will not be noted. Remember: THIS IS NOT YOUR DOCTOR. Anything you tell this doctor willnot be confidential and can be used by your insurance companyagainst you. After the IME, write down what the doctor said and what the doctor didto you. Call your lawyer immediately after the IME. You are entitled to receive a copy of the IME report. If you cannot attend the IME at the scheduled time, call your lawyerimmediately or call the doctor's office to reschedule, otherwise you maybe charged a cancellation fee.

Even the best policies, which claim to be written in "easy to read" format,can be confusing and sometimes downright unintelligible. Often the partiesto an insurance dispute have to let the court determine what a policy reallymeans. However, the basic concepts behind an auto insurance policy are notcomplicated. Frankly, everyone who drives a vehicle or owns an insurancepolicy should have at least a general familiarity with what is inside thatlengthy document. The following summary, while very general, should help. Most auto insurance policies have two general coverage parts. Part Oneincludes Liability Insurance, and Part Two includes Coverage for your Vehicle. PART ONE - LIABILITY COVERAGE Liability to Others In Oregon, Washington and Idaho, as in most states, every driveris required to have liability coverage. This coverage provides that if youare at fault in causing injury to another person or damage to someone else'sproperty, your insurance company will pay for that injury or damage. How much the insurance company must pay depends upon how much coverageyou purchase. Naturally, higher limits of coverage cost more money. The amount of coverage will show on the front page of your policy (calledthe "declarations page") and can be written as either singlelimit coverage or split limit coverage. Each statehas a minimum amount of liability coverage that is required, but you alwayshave the option to purchase more, and it is frequently a very good idea todo so. Single limit coverage will be in one dollar amount, suchas $50,000. That figure represents the total amount of money the insurancecompany will pay for any combination of bodily injury to others damage tothe property of others caused in an accident which is your fault. Split limit coverage will look something like this: $25,000/$50,000/$10,000. The first number represents the maximum the companywill pay for injury to ANY ONE PERSON in an accident which is your fault. The second number represents the total amount the company will pay for bodilyinjury to ALL PERSONS in the accident (there could be two or thirty peopleinjured). The last number represents a separate amount for damage to theproperty of others in the accident. Let's look at two examples, comparing a $50,000 single limit policyto a $25,000/$50,000/$10,000 split limit policy, to see how each type ofcoverage would pay. Assume in each example that the accident is your fault. Example One: You hit a Honda Accord and injure the driver. The Honda sustains $8,000 damage, and the driver's injuries have a settlementvalue of $40,000. The single limit policy will pay $48,000 (sincethe total damage is under $50,000) and the split limit policy willpay $33,000 (the maximum for one injury is $25,000, plus the property damage). Example Two: You hit a Mercedes Benz and injure the driverand two passengers. The Mercedes sustains $12,000 damage, and each of theindividuals has $16,000 in injuries. (Total of $60,000) The singlelimit policy will pay $50,000 (its policy limit). The split limitpolicy will pay $58,000 ($16,000 to each of the three individuals and thepolicy limit maximum of $10,000 property damage for the Mercedes). Another very important feature of your liability policy is that ifyou cause an accident and the other driver brings a lawsuit, your insurancecompany will hire a lawyer to represent you at no cost to you. The amountthe company pays to the lawyer will be in addition to the amount of coverageyou have for payment of damages, as shown on your declarations page. Personal Injury Protection and Med Pay Your liability coverage may include Personal Injury Protection ("PIP")or Medical Payments ("Med Pay") benefits. Some states, such as Oregon andWashington, require PIP coverage in a policy unlessyou specifically reject it. Other states do not require or offer such coverage,but make available Med Pay for an additional charge. Idaho offers Med Pay coverage, but you may have to ask your agent for it. PIP provides a source of payment for YOUR medical bills and some of YOURwage loss following an auto accident. Similarly, Med Pay provides some coveragefor YOUR medical bills. These are called "no fault" coverages because theypay even if the accident is your fault. Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Some states, again Oregon and Washington, for example, require thatauto insurance policies have Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverageunless you specifically reject it. In Idaho and many states, this coverageis not required but it is available. You may have to ask your agent forit. Uninsured motorist coverage protects YOU in the event you are injuredthrough the fault of someone else and they do not have any insurance. Forexample, if you are rearended by someone who is uninsured, you can bringa claim against your own insurance company under your uninsured motoristcoverage and you are entitled to collect the same recovery as if the at-faultdriver had insurance. Underinsured motorist coverage is similar. Assume that the at-fault driverhad a $50,000 single limit policy but your injuries have a reasonable settlementvalue of $80,000. If you have $100,000 in underinsured motorist coverage,then you will collect the $50,000 from the at-fault driver's insurance companyand the additional $30,000 from your own company. PART TWO - COVERAGE FOR DAMAGE TO YOUR CAR The second part of an auto policy covers your car in the event itis damaged or destroyed in a collision or otherwise. There are two typesof coverage you can purchase, called collision and comprehensive. You arenot required to purchase these coverages. However, if you take out a loanto purchase a car, or you are leasing a vehicle, the lender will requirethat you purchase these coverages on the car to protect the lender in casethe car is damaged or stolen. Collision Coverage If you purchase collision coverage, the insurance company will payto repair your car if it is damaged in a collision, regardless who causedthe accident. If the repairs would exceed the value of the car, they mayconsider the vehicle a total loss and pay you the fairmarket value of your vehicle. Collision coverage will have a deductible, which is a portion of the repairswhich you must pay. For example, if the cost to repair your vehicle is $3,000and you have a $500 deductible, you will pay $500 and the insurance companywill pay $2,500. Comprehensive Coverage If you purchase comprehensive coverage, the insurance company willpay to repair your car if it is damaged other than in a collision, or ifit is stolen. Examples of when comprehensive coverage would apply are: Fire Theft of the vehicle Hail damage Vandalism Broken windshield Comprehensive coverage usually has a deductible also, and the coverageis less expensive than collision. Generally you may purchase comprehensiveonly and not collision (but not the other way around). Insurance agentsoften recommend keeping comprehensive coverage on an older vehicle, evenafter it is no longer cost effective to keep collision coverage. A GENERAL WARNING!!! As we said, insurance policies are complicated. The above outlinewill give you a general idea how coverage works. However, many fact situationsarise that raise complicated questions. For example, you are driving a rentedcar, or a friend's car. Or you are a passenger in someone's car, or youare a pedestrian, or your son is hit on a bicycle. You will need to determine: Who is covered? What is the limit of coverage? Are there exclusions which would allow the insurance company to denycoverage? In these more complex situations, you need to seek expert advice. You will want to talk to your insurance agent. You may need to seek theadvice of an attorney.

FinckeAttorney at Law It is important to remember that the reasonthe police are dealing with you may end up being explained to a judge orjury in a courtroom. Police officers are trained to write down what peoplesay and to repeat what they have heard later from their notes and reports.Most people do not write down what goes on between them and the police andthey are at a disadvantage when it comes time to recall who said what severalmonths or even years later. So how do you deal with the officer whocomes up to you on the street and says "Hold on, I want to talk with you?"Your first response might be, "How can I help you?" or it might be "Whatdo you want?" The first example sets a better tone with the officer and letsher know that you are willing to talk, at least at first. The second exampleis more hostile and will be taken as a challenge to the officer's authority.The first response might very well lead the officer to say, "We're investigatinga burglary that just happened down the street and want to know if you sawanything." The second response may make the officer say, "Turn around andput your hands on the wall," followed by a pat down search where the officersearches your clothing for weapons which may be used to harm her or others.That will be followed by, "What's your name and lets see some identification?"How you respond will often determine what happens next. The basic rules after your first contact with an officer depend on what youmight have done (which you know about) and what the officer thinks you havedone (which you may not know about). If you get the sense that the officerwants to talk with you because he thinks you might be involved in criminalactivity, then it is important to remember that the officer does not haveto warn you of your constitutional rights unless she arrests you and intendsto ask you questions. The famous Miranda warnings go likethis, "You have the right to remain silent and not say anything whichmight incriminate yourself. Anything you say can and will be used againstyou in a court of law. You can stop answering questions I ask you at anytime.You have the right to have a lawyer with you when you go to court or duringquestioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed foryou." Officers do not have to give these warnings unless youhave been arrested and they intend to ask you questions. This means thatanything you might say or write, before you are arrested, can be used againstyou in court. Many people have received lengthy prison terms because of whatthey said or wrote before their arrest. Many people have talked with policeand admitted to criminal activity while on the street and paid the pricefor their ignorance of the law with a long stay in prison. The advicecontained in the warnings applies to all police-citizen contacts. If approachedby an officer, you do not have to answer any questions she may ask you, evenif you are not arrested. You are perfectly within your rights to say to theofficer who asks to speak with you, "Officer, I do not want speak with you.Good bye." At this point you should be free to leave the officer's presence.The officer may not like this and may challenge you with words like, "Ifyou have nothing to hide, why won't you speak to me?" Just like the firstquestion, you do not have to answer this one either. If you refuseto answer the officer's questions, she might take the next step by saying,"You will have to stay here and answer my questions" or "You're not leavinguntil I find out what I want." If the officer restrains you by words or actions,such as putting you in a squad car or in handcuffs, then she must give youthe Miranda warnings, if she intends to ask you questions. If shejust wants you to sweat, she may not give you the warnings at all and justtake you to the station, just to show you who is the boss. If youare not free to leave, you have been arrested, whether or not you are takento a police station. If the police have arrested you, that means that theyhave enough information to believe that you are at least a suspect in criminalactivity. Under these circumstances, you should follow the advice of thewarnings and refuse to tell the officers anything unless you are providedwith a lawyer. After telling the officer your name and date of birth, youshould say, "I will not answer any more questions until I have a lawyer present."This may mean that you will spend a little bit longer time in jail untilyou can call a lawyer, but it will be worth the wait. You will not be ableto successfully talk your way out of police custody, once you are arrested,without a lawyer's help. Sometimes the police arrest people on suspicion,hoping that they will confess or make a statement which can be used againstthe person. Often, the police will tell the arrested person that cooperationwith them is best and it will go better for them if they cooperate by talking.Remember, talking and writing are the same and you do not have to sign awritten statement before it can be used against you. Officers maypromise shorter sentences and other deals for statements or confessions.The police cannot legally make deals with people they arrest. The only personwho can make a deal that can be enforced is the prosecutor, and he shouldnot talk with you without a lawyer present who represents you. Itis legal for the police to lie to you about what they know or suspect orwhat other people have said about you. The police might try these or othertricks to get you to talk. Police often do not tape record or videotapeinterviews with those they arrest. If you talk with them, it will be yourword against the officer's word about what you said. You should refuse totalk without a lawyer present to represent you, no matter what the policesay. A weekend spent in jail waiting for a lawyer is better than a lengthyprison sentence spent because you talked to the police without a lawyer tohelp you. Trying to talk your way out of the police station by telling thepolice what they want to hear or by telling a lie will always do much moreharm than good to your case. The only exception to this rule is ifyou are arrested for drunk driving. Then, you will need to figure out ifyou want to take a breath or chemical test, as required by law. If you refuseto take such a test, after being arrested for drunk driving, your driver'slicense can be revoked for a year or more for refusing to take thetest. If you have been arrested for just drunk driving, it may beadvisable to take the test. If you were involved in an accident where peoplewere killed or seriously injured, it may be advisable not to take the testand suffer the revocation rather than give the police evidence of your possibleintoxication. In either event, the police do not have to let you speak witha lawyer before taking the test. If you tell them that you will not takethe test without a lawyer present, they will treat your comment as a refusaland so will the court. Remember, in most situations you are underno obligation to talk with the police. If you are arrested, then you shouldimmediately ask to have a lawyer present and you should not say anythingto the police until a lawyer who represents you ispresent.

If you politely refuse to answer any of thecop's questions concerning the DUI investigation, either before or afterarrest, then there won't be any statements that can be used against you incourt. Field Sobriety Tests are completely voluntary. If you perform them,you may be arrested anyway. It may be better not to give the cop evidencethat will be used against you in court. You can politely refuse to do thefield sobriety exercises. If you are older than 21, refuse to take a preliminary alcohol screeningtest. This on scene breath test is completely voluntary and you have theabsolute right to refuse this type of breath test. When given a choice of blood, breath, or urine test after arrest, choosea urine test if at all possible. It is the most unreliable of the threechemical tests (blood, breath, or urine). If no urine test available, choose a breath test. The breath machinesare not 100% accurate and there are many possibilities for error. Contact a friend or relative from jail as soon as possible so they canhear you speak and note your state of sobriety. Always be polite and respectful to the police officers. How you areperceived by a jury is extremely critical. Some jurisdictions video the arrest, breath testing and/or booking process. Always be on your best behavior. Make a detailed list of all the events before being stopped up to andincluding being released from custody. Retain an experienced DUI defense attorney to represent you. Only anexperienced DUI defense attorney is able to spot your favorable issues andpresent them to a prosecutor, judge or jury. Remember, the best way to avoid a DUI conviction is to not drink and drive.Purchasing a Portable Breath Testerwill also assist you in determining your alcohol level before you drive. Unfortunately, the way our laws are going even if you've had a small amountof alcohol and you are not impaired, as long as you smell like alcohol yourchances of being arrested are very high. However, being arrested for DUIdoes not automatically result in a conviction or loss of your driver's license. The above tips are designed to provide accurate and authoritative information. It is not designed to render legal opinions.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institutenew Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizingits powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effecttheir Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governmentslong established should not be changed for light and transient causes;and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposedto suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishingthe forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abusesandusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reducethem under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throwoff such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is nowthe necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeatedinjuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishmentof an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Factsbe submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessaryfor the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediateand pressing importance, unless suspended in their operationtill his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation oflarge districts of people, unless those people would relinquishthe right of Representation in the Legislature, a rightinestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of theirPublic Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing theminto compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposingwith manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at largefor their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposedto all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States;for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assentto Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenureof their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms ofOfficers to harass our People, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armieswithout the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent ofand superior to the Civil Power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdictionforeign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murderswhich they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouringProvince, establishing therein an Arbitrary government,and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at oncean example and fit instrument for introducing the sameabsolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws,and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselvesinvested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protectionand waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns,and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenariesto compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begunwith circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in themost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seasto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners oftheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and hasendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redressin the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answeredonly by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus markedby every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the rulerof a free People. Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren.We have warned them from time to time of attempts by theirlegislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration andsettlement here. We have appealed to their native justiceand magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of ourcommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitablyinterrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have beendeaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore,acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge ofthe world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies,solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are,and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,and that all political connection between them and the Stateof Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power tolevy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States mayof right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firmreliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledgeto each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

What do police officers look for when searching for drunk     drivers on the highways?	The following is a list of symptoms in descending order of 	probability that the person observed is driving while 	intoxicated. The list is based upon research conducted by the 	National Highway Traffic Administration:		(1)  Turning with a wide radius		(2)  Straddling center of lane marker		(3)  "Appearing to be drunk"		(4)  Almost striking object or vehicle		(5)  Weaving		(6)  Driving on other than designated highway		(7)  Swerving		(8)  Speed more than 10 mph below limit		(9)  Stopping without cause in traffic lane		(10) Following too closely		(11) Drifting		(12) Tires on center or lane marker		(13) Braking erratically		(14) Driving into opposing or crossing traffic		(15) Signalling inconsistent with driving actions		(16) Slow response to traffic signals		(17) Stopping inappropriately (other than in lane)		(18) Turning abruptly or illegally		(19) Accelerating or decelerating rapidly		(20) Headlights off	Speeding, incidentally, is not a symptom of DUI; because of 	quicker judgment and reflexes, it may indicate sobriety. 2.  If I'm stopped by a police officer and he asks me if I've been     drinking, what should I say?  	You are not required to answer potentially incriminating 	questions. A polite "I would like to speak with an attorney 	before I answer any questions" is a good reply. On the other 	hand, saying that you had one or two beers is not incriminating: 	it is not sufficient to cause intoxication -- and it may 	explain the odor of alcohol on the breath. 3.  Do I have a right to an attorney when I'm stopped by an officer     and asked to take a field sobriety test?	The law on this varies from state to state. As a general rule, 	however, there is no right to an attorney until you have 	submitted to (or refused) blood, breath or urine testing. In 	some states, there is a right to consult with counsel upon 	being arrested or before deciding whether to submit to chemical 	testing. Of course, this does not mean that you cannot ask for one. 4.  What is the officer looking for during the initial detention     at the scene?	The traditional symptoms of intoxication taught at the police 	academies are:		(1)  Flushed face		(2)  Red, watery, glassy and/or bloodshot eyes		(3)  Odor of alcohol on breath		(4)  Slurred speech		(5)  Fumbling with wallet trying to get license		(6)  Failure to comprehend the officer's questions		(7)  Staggering when exiting vehicle		(8)  Swaying/instability on feet		(9)  Leaning on car for support		(10) Combative, argumentative, jovial or other 		     "inappropriate" attitude		(11) Soiled, rumpled, disorderly clothing		(12) Stumbling while walking		(13) Disorientation as to time and place		(14) Inability to follow directions 5.  What should I do if I'm asked to take field sobriety tests?	There are a wide range of field sobriety tests (FSTs), 	including heel-to-toe, finger-to-nose, one-leg stand, alphabet 	recitation, modified position of attention, fingers-to-thumb, 	hand pat, etc.  Most officers will use a set battery of three 	to five such tests.	Unlike the chemical test, where refusal to submit may have	serious consequences, you are not legally required to take	any FSTs. The reality is that officers have usually made up 	their minds to arrest when they give the FSTs; the tests are 	simply additional evidence which the suspect inevitable "fails".  	Thus, in most cases a polite refusal may be appropriate. 6.  Why did the officer make me follow a penlight with my eyes to 	    the left and right? 	This is the "horizontal gaze nystagmus" test, a relatively 	recent development in DUI investigation. The officer attempts 	to estimate the angle at which the eye begins to jerk 	("nystagmus" is medical jargon for eye jerking); if this occurs	sooner than 45 degrees, it theoretically indicates an excessive	blood-alcohol concentration. The smoothness of the eye's 	tracking the penlight (or finger or pencil) is also a factor, 	as is the jerking when the eye is as far to the side as 	it can go.	This field sobriety test has proven to be subject to a number 	of different problems, not the least of which is the 	non-medically trained officer's ability to recognize nystagmus 	and estimate the angle of onset.  Because of this, and the fact	that the test is not accepted by the medical community, it is 	not admissible as evidence in many states; it continues, however, 	to be widely used by law enforcement. 7.  Should I agree to take a chemical test? What happens if I don't?	The consequences of refusing to submit to a blood, breath or 	urine test varies according to the state.  Generally, there 	are three adverse results:		(1)  Your driver's license will be suspended for a 			     period of time, commonly three, six or twelve 			     months.  This is true even if you are found not 			     guilty of the DUI charge.		(2)  In some states, refusal is a separate crime; in 			     others, it adds jail time to the sentence for the 			     DUI offense.		(3)  The fact of refusal can be introduced into		     evidence as "consciousness of guilt".  Of course, 		     the defense is free to offer other reasons for 		     the refusal.	Thus, the decision is one of weighing the likelihood of a high 	blood-alcohol reading against the consequences for refusing.  8.  Do I have a choice of chemical tests?  Which should I choose?	In most states, you have a choice -- usually, of breath, blood 	or urine (some states, however, do not offer urinalysis).  If 	you choose breath, many jurisdictions permit you to have a 	second test or blood or urine; this is because a breath sample 	is not saved and so cannot later be re-analyzed by the defense.	Analysis of a blood sample is potentially the most accurate.  	Breath machines are susceptible to a number of problems 	rendering them often unreliable. The least accurate by far, 	however, is urinalysis.  Thus, if you are confident that you 	are sober, a blood sample is the wise choice; urine, being 	least accurate and most easily impeached, is the best option if 	you believe your blood-alcohol concentration is above the 	legal limit. 9.  The officer never gave me a Miranda warning: Can I get my case     dismissed?	No.The officer is supposed to give a 5th Amendment warning 	after he arrests you. Often, however, they do not. The only 	consequence is that the prosecution cannot use any of your 	answers to questions asked by the police after the arrest.	Of more consequence in most cases is the failure to advise 	you of the state's "implied consent" law that is, your 	legal obligation to take a chemical test and the results 	if you refuse. This can effect the suspension of your license. 10.  Why am I being charged with TWO crimes?	The traditional offense is "driving under the influence of 	alcohol" (DUI) or, in some states, "driving while intoxicated" 	(DWI). In recent years, however, 43 states have also enacted 	a second, so-called "per se" offense: driving with an excessive 	blood-alcohol concentration (either .08% or .10%).  In those 	states, BOTH offenses are charged.  The defendant can even be 	convicted of both, but can be punished for only one.	If the case involves a refusal to submit to chemical testing, 	of course, only the traditional offense will be charged. 11.  The officer took my license and served me with a notice of      suspension after the breath test: How can he do that if I'm      presumed innocent?	Agreed, it is blatantly unfair. But the law in most states 	having a "per se" statute (see question #10) provides for 	immediate suspension and confiscation of the license if the 	breath test result is above the legal limit (or, in the case 	of a blood or urine test, if the officer reasonably believes 	the result will be above the limit). 12.  Can I represent myself? What can a lawyer do for me?	You can represent yourself -- although it is not a good idea.  	"Drunk driving" is a very complex field with increasingly 	harsh consequences. There is a minefield of complicated 	procedural, evidentiary, constitutional, sentencing and 	administrative license issues.	What can a lawyer do?  Nothing (or worse) if he is not 	qualified in this highly specialized field -- no more than a 	family doctor could help with brain surgery.  A qualified 	attorney, however, can review the case for defects, suppress 	evidence, compel discovery of such things as calibration and 	maintenance records for the breath machine, have blood samples 	independently analyzed, negotiate for a lesser charge or 	reduced sentence, obtain expert witnesses for trial, contest 	the administrative license suspension, etc.  13.  How can I find a qualified drunk driving lawyer?	The best way to find a good DUI/DWI lawyer is by reputation.  	There are a few attorneys who have national reputations; these, 	of course, are expensive.  Thus, the best approach is to ask 	other attorneys in the jurisdiction:  Who is the best in the 	area? If you do not know any attorneys, go to the local 	courthouse and ask people like bailiffs, clerks and public 	defenders: Who would THEY go to if arrested for drunk driving?	Contrary to popular belief, it is not a wise idea to obtain a 	referral from the local Bar association or referral service.  	There are rarely any qualifications required for an attorney to 	be on a referral list; he usually only has to ask to be placed 	on it.  When you call, you are simply given the next name on 	that list.	An excellent indication of quality and experience is membership 	in the NATIONAL COLLEGE FOR DUI DEFENSE, located in Atlanta, 	Georgia (800-442-2291).  Completion of that organization's 	intensive annual summer seminar at Harvard Law School is another 	clear sign of ability.	When you meet with the attorney, make sure of three things:		(1)  He has extensive experience in DUI/DWI litigation;		(2)  He has a reputation for going to trial in 			     appropriate cases, rather than just "copping out" 			     his clients; and		(3)  The financial terms of representation are clear. 14.  What will it cost to get a lawyer?	This varies, of course, by the reputation and experience of 	the lawyer and by the geographic location.  As with doctors, 	generally, the more skilled the attorney and the larger the 	city, the higher the fee.  A related factor is the amount of 	time a lawyer devotes to his cases: the better lawyers take 	fewer clients, spending more hours on each.	The range of fees is huge.  A general practitioner in a small	community may charge only $300; a DUI specialist with a 	national reputation may charge $7500.  In addition, the fee 	may vary by such other factors as:		(1)  Is the offense a misdemeanor or felony?		(2)  If prior convictions are alleged, the procedures 			     for attacking them may add to the cost.		(3)  The fee may or may not include trial or appeals.		(4)  Administrative license suspension procedures may 		     also be extra.		(5)  The lawyer may charge a fixed fee, or he may ask 		     for a retainer in advance -- to be applied 		     against hourly charges.		(6)  Costs such as witness fees, independent blood 			     analysis, service of subpoenas, etc., may be extra.	Whatever the fee quoted, you should ask for a written agreement 	and make sure you understand all the terms. 15.  What is the punishment for drunk driving?	Again, this varies according to the laws of the state and the 	customs of the local jurisdiction.  Generally speaking, a 	conviction for a first offense may involve a fine, a license 	suspension or restriction, attendance at a DUI education 	course for a period of time, and probation for perhaps three 	years. A short jail sentence may or may not be required; for 	a second offense, it almost certainly will.  Additional 	punishment may involve community service, ignition interlock 	devices and/or impounding of the vehicle. 16.  What is a sentence "enhancement"?	Most states increase the punishment in drunk driving cases 	if certain facts exist. The most common of these is an earlier 	conviction for the same or a similar offense -- usually 	within five or seven years of the current offense.  Other 	commonly encountered enhancements (which must usually be 	alleged in the complaint) include:		(1)  A child was in the car at the time.		(2)  The defendant was travelling 20 or 30 miles over 		     the speed limit at the time.		(3)  The blood-alcohol concentration was over .20%.		(4)  The defendant refused to submit to a chemical test.		(5)  There was property damage or injury.	In most states, the existence of any personal injury caused 	by drunk driving elevates the offense to a felony.  A death 	can trigger manslaughter or even, in a few states, second 	degree murder charges. 17.  What is a "rising BAC defense"?	It is unlawful to have an excessive blood-alcohol 	concentration (BAC) at the time of DRIVING -- not at the 	time of being TESTED.  Since it takes between 45 minutes 	and 3 hours for alcohol to be absorbed into the system, an 	individual's BAC may continue to rise for some time after 	he is stopped and arrested.  	Commonly, it is an hour or more after the stop when the 	blood, breath or urine test is given to the suspect. Assume 	that the result is .12%.  If the suspect has continued to 	absorb alcohol since he was stopped, his BAC at the time he 	was driving may have been only .08%. In other words, the test 	result shows a blood-alcohol concentration above the legal 	limit -- but his actual BAC AT THE TIME OF DRIVING was below. 18.  What is "mouth alcohol"?	"Mouth alcohol" refers to the existence of any alcohol in the 	mouth or esophagus. If this is present during a breath test, 	then the results will be falsely high.  This is because the 	breath machine assumes that the breath is from the lungs; 	for complex physiological reasons, its internal computer 	multiplies the amount of alcohol by 2100.  Thus, even a tiny 	amount of alcohol breathed directly into the machine from the 	mouth or throat can have a huge impact.	Mouth alcohol can be caused in many ways. Belching, burping, 	hiccupping or vomiting within 20 minutes of taking the test 	can bring vapor from alcoholic beverages still in the stomach 	up into the mouth and throat. Taking a breath freshener can 	send a machine's reading way up (such products as Binaca and 	Listerine have alcohol in them); cough syrups and other 	products also contain alcohol.  Dental bridges and dental 	caps can trap alcohol.  Blood in the mouth from an injury is 	yet another source of inaccurate breath test results: 	breathed into the mouthpiece, any alcohol in the blood will 	be multiplied 2100 times. 19.  What defenses are there in a DUI case?	Potential defenses in a given drunk driving case are almost 	limitless due to the complexities of the offense.  Roughly 	speaking, however, the majority can be broken down into the 	following areas:		(1)  Driving.  Intoxication is not enough: the 		     prosecution must also prove that the defendant 		     was driving. This may be difficult if, as in the		     case of accidents, there are no witnesses to his 		     being the driver of the vehicle.		(2)  Probable cause. Evidence will be suppressed if 		     the officer did not have legal cause to (a) stop, 		     (b) detain, and (c) arrest.  Sobriety roadblocks 		     present particularly complex issues.		(3)  Miranda. Incriminating statements may be 		     suppressed if warnings were not given at the 		     appropriate time.		(4)  Implied consent warnings. If the officer did not 		     advise you of the consequences of refusing to 		     take a chemical test, or gave it incorrectly, 		     this may affect admissibility of the test results 		     -- as well as the license suspension imposed by 		     the motor vehicle department.		(5)  "Under the influence". The officer's observations 		     and opinions as to intoxication can be questioned 		     -- the circumstances under which the field 		     sobriety tests were given, for example, or the 		     subjective (and predisposed) nature of what the 		     officer considers as "failing".  Too, witnesses 		     can testify that you appeared to be sober.		(6)  Blood-alcohol concentration. There exists a wide 		     range of potential problems with blood, breath 		     or urine testing. "Non-specific" analysis, for 		     example: most breath machines will register many 		     chemical compounds found on the human breath as 		     alcohol. And breath machines assume a 2100-to-1 		     ratio in converting alcohol in the breath into 		     alcohol in the blood; in fact, this ratio varies 		     widely from person to person (and within a 		     person from one moment to another).  Radio 		     frequency interference can result in inaccurate 		     readings. These and other defects in analysis 		     can be brought out in cross-examination of the 		     state's expert witness, and/or the defense can 		     hire its own forensic chemist.		(7)  Testing during the absorptive phase. The blood, 		     breath or urine test will be unreliable if done 		     while you are still actively absorbing alcohol 		     (it takes 45 minutes to three hours to complete 		     absorption; this can be delayed if food is 		     present in the stomach).  Thus, drinking "one 		     for the road" can cause inaccurate test results.		(8)  Retrograde extrapolation. This refers to the 		     requirement that the BAC be "related back" in 		     time from the test to the driving (see question 		     #17).  Again, a number of complex physiological 		     problems are involved here.		(9)  Regulation of blood-alcohol testing.  The 		     prosecution must prove that the blood, breath or 		     urine test complied with state requirements as 		     to calibration, maintenance, etc.		(10) License suspension hearings. A number of issues 		     can be raised in the context of an administrative 		     hearing before the state's department of 		     motor vehicles. 20.  I have some questions about my DUI case. Where can I go      for answers?	An experienced drunk driving lawyer is the best source, of 	course. Short of that:		(1)  Go to a law library (at courthouses and law 		     schools) and research DUI law and blood-alcohol 		     analysis.		(2)  Buy one of my books:		     a.

A1. For the best overall protection, Yes. However, if you haveother-than-collision (often referred to as comprehensive) and collision coverageon at least one vehicle on your auto policy, then your policy will coveryour rental vehicle as though it were your own. The deductible(s) on yourpolicy will apply to the rental car. Your auto policy will not pay for anyextra charges the rental agency may apply, such as loss of use or administrativefees. In addition, there may be a difference of opinion between the rentalagency and your insurance company regarding the value of the rental car inthe event of a total loss. Concerning any benefit you may gain from chargingthe rental car with your "gold" credit card, the charge card only respondsas excess over any other available insurance. Furthermore, the "gold" cardmay not pay for loss of use of the rental car and administrative fees inthe event of a loss to the rental car. You should always clarify coveragewith your agent and be sure you understand the rental agency's contract. Q2 Why does the driving record of members of my householdaffect my rates if they do not drive my car? A2. Auto policies are heavily regulated by the state you live in and mostsituations require insurance to pay no matter who's driving your car. Ifthe insurance company only had to pay for losses involving the listed driversthen they would only be concerned with the driving records of the listeddrivers because all others would not be covered. Q3 Should I buy collision coverage on my ten year oldcar? A3. The answer depends on many factors. Compare how much your car is worthversus the cost of collision coverage plus your deductible. You can getan estimate of how much your car is worth from the "blue book" or N.A.D.A.which can be found at book stores and libraries. If you have not transferredthe collision risk to an insurance company by buying collision coverage,you are assuming the entire risk yourself. Sometimes the collision coveragemay seem expensive, but it should be purchased if you could not afford toabsorb the total loss of the value of the car. Remember collision coverageresponds to damage to your car only. If it is the other party's fault theirpolicy will pay for damages to your car and there is no deductible. Q4 If I drive someone else's car and wreck it, doesmy policy pay for the damage? A4. No. Insurance follows the car not the driver. The insurance coveringthe car would respond to damages. Your policy may respond but only as excessover the primary insurance covering the car. Q5 What can I do to keep my auto premiums down? A5. Make sure you are getting all the discounts allows by your insurancecompany such as: Multi-Car, renewal, claim-free, good student, driver training,defensive driver course, anti-lock brakes, air bags, anti-theft device, andmulti-policy discounts. Households with drivers having no tickets or accidentswill be eligible for the best rates. Ask us how much you can save by increasingyour deductibles. Sports cars, four-wheel drive vehicles and expensive carswill increase your premiums. Q6 How will an alcohol-related ticket (DUI or DWI)affect my premium? A6. If you already have a policy in effect, it is possible that nothing willhappen for some time. Your current insurance company may not find out thatyou have the ticket. However, sometimes insurance companies randomly checkdriving records. Many companies would non-renew your policy at expirationin such an instance. If that were to happen, there are several non-standard,commonly referred to as high-risk, companies that would take you. It wouldnot be unusual for your premium to triple with a non-standard company. Ifyou are currently getting your insurance from a preferred company, you shouldsit tight and not make any waves. Pay your bills on time and do not letit cancel. Also, do not change companies, as any company writing a new policywill order your driving record and find out about the ticket.

The bureau, a Departmentof Justice agency in the Office of JusticePrograms,reported that about one in six had served at least three such prior DWI sentencesin a jail or prison. During 1989, more than 1.7 million drivers were arrested for drivingunder the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI), and between 1980 and 1989the number of arrests for DUI increased almost 22 percent, whereas the numberof licensed drivers grew by about 14 percent. DUI is the general term for drivers operating a vehicle under the influenceof alcohol or drugs. The BJS study concentrated on jail inmates chargedwith driving while intoxicated from alcohol and refers to them as DWIoffenders. "Jailed drunk drivers were found to have an extensive history of abusivedrinking and chronic contact with the criminal justice system," commentedBJS Director Steven D. Dillingham. "The study also found that DUI arrest rates for drivers under 21 yearsold dropped substantially during the last decade," Dillingham noted. "The1989 DUI arrest rate for drivers 16 and 17 years old was 25 percent lowerthan their 1980 rate, and drivers 18 through 20 years of age had a 9 percentlower arrest rate than in 1980." Almost half of the people confined on DWI charges who were interviewedin jail were already on probation or parole or in some other criminal justice status for a DWI or other criminal offense atthe time of their arrest. About one-third of them were on probation from an earlier criminal conviction. Half of the people in jail who had been convicted of DWI charges wereestimated to have consumed at least six ounces of alcohol (about equal to the amount of alcohol in 12 bottles of beer) in afive-hour period. About 29 percent said they had consumed 11 ounces or more of alcohol (approximately equal to 22 bottlesof beer) before their arrest. More than half of the inmates charged with or convicted of DWI describedthemselves as alcoholics. Forty-four percent of the alcoholic DWI offenders reported that they usually drank alcoholic beveragesdaily and almost 80 percent reported having participated in an alcohol treatment program. The findings are based on data from interviews with a nationallyrepresentative sample of 5,675 inmates in 424 jails during the summer of 1989. As of June 30 of that year there were about 395,000people in 3,312 local jails throughout the country. Other significant survey results: --During the 1980-1989 period the number of DUI arrests per capita grewby almost 7 percent--from 982 per 100,000 licensed drivers to 1,049. --About 9 percent of all people in local jails on June 30, 1989, werecharged with or had been convicted of DWI offenses, and of this group, 86 percent had a prior sentence to probation, jail orprison for a DWI or other criminal offense. --Of the convicted DWI offenders, 61 percent said they had been drinkingonly beer, 18 percent only liquor and 2 percent only wine. Twenty percent said they had been drinking more than one typeof alcohol. --Almost a third of the jailed DWI offenders said they had been drinkingwith others in a bar, tavern or inn before their arrest and about a quarter said they had been drinking at a friend's house. About one in nine said they had been drinking alone at home or in their vehicle. The study also examined the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of thejailed drivers measured by the number of grams of pure alcohol present in 100 milliliters of blood. It estimatedthat DWI offenders in jail averaged 0.21 grams at the time of arrest, compared to an average of 0.16 grams for drinking driversinvolved in fatal accidents during 1989. Fifty percent of the DWI offenders sent to jail were sentenced to sixmonths or less. Among first-time DWI offenders, half received sentences of 115 days or fewer. For offenders withtwo or more prior DWI convictions, half were sentenced to 181 days or fewer. The survey also found substantial differences in the racial and ethniccomposition of DWI defendants compared to other jailinmates. Of the jail inmates charged with a DWI offense, 67.7 percent werewhite non-Hispanics, 8.2 percent were black non-Hispanics, 19.5 percent Hispanicsand 4.6 percent were from other groups, including Asians, Pacific Islanders,American Indians and Alaskan natives. Of the jail inmates charged withother offenses, 36 percent were white non-Hispanics, 45 percent black non-Hispanics,16.9 percent Hispanics and 2.1 percent were from other backgrounds.

Some of the main differences are: the amount of alcohol in a person's bloodstream that constitutes being under the influence, the exact length of jail sentences and the amount of fines that may be imposed. This article is based on California law which is similar to the laws of many other states. 1. Q: Do you have to be "drunk" to be guilty of drunk driving? A: No. Years ago, a drunk driving charge meant someone was "drunk" in the way all of us commonly understand the word - intoxicated. But today, intoxication as we know it is not required for one to be guilty of drunk driving. During the last ten years public outcry against the toll of injury and death which drinking drivers inflict has changed the laws against drunk driving radically and made them much more severe. So the criminal laws against drinking and driving now mean operating a vehicle with considerably less alcohol in your system than what we customarily recognize as being enough to make a person drunk. You may not think you are drunk. Those around you may not think you are drunk. Indeed, for the purpose of every other situation except driving, you may not even be considered drunk. But your condition may be enough for you to be found guilty of a drunk driving offense under the current definition of the law. And if you are convicted, you will suffer some very harsh penalties. 2. Q: Legally, just what is "drunk driving?" A: A drunk driving offense, sometimes called driving while intoxicated (DWI) or driving under the influence (DUI), really has three general meanings: (1) Driving with any amount of alcohol in your system which causes your physical abilities to be impaired in any way. (2) Driving with a level of alcohol in your system which amounts to a measurement of.08 of blood alcohol content. To be guilty of this offense, absolutely no impairment of any of your physical abilities is necessary. You may well be the world's most talented, careful and safest driver, but if your blood alcohol content registers .08 or above you are guilty of a criminal offense. (3) Driving with drugs in your system or with a combination of drugs andalcohol, no matter what the amounts of those substances may be, where your physical abilities have become impaired in any way. It does not matter if the drugs are legal , over the counter medications like antihistamines, nor does it matter if you have a prescription to take the drugs. If you are impaired as a result of taking them, then you are guilty of a criminal offense. 3. Q: What amount of alcohol do I need to drink to have a blood alcohol content of .08 or higher? A: Each person's blood alcohol content from drinking certain amounts of alcohol will vary, depending upon a number of factors. The main factor is your weight. To calculate your blood alcohol content based upon having normal drinks such as a 12 oz. beer, a 4 ounce glass of wine, or a single mixed drink containing a one ounce shot of 100 proof liquor, the following rule of thumb is an illustration: 120 lbs: one drink in one hour -- .032 two drinks in one hour -- .064 three drinks in one hour -- .096 180 lbs: one drink in one hour -- .021 two drinks in one hour -- .042 three drinks in one hour -- .063 four drinks in one hour -- .084 4. Q: What kind of reason does a police officer or highway patrolman need to have in order to stop me to investigate whether or not I am driving under the influence? A: The officer must have what is legally termed a "reasonable suspicion," based on something unusual that is actually observed about the way a person is driving. This is a very low standard and it can be satisfied by virtually anything which appears out of the ordinary and that might be a sign of a driver being under the influence. In addition, during holiday seasons, police officers typically set up field sobriety checkpoints where they routinely stop every driver who passes through the checkpoint. These checkpoints do not require the officer to observe anything suspicious about a person before stopping and investigating someone. 5. Q: What happens to me if I am pulled over by the police or the highway patrol for investigation of drunk driving? A: If you are stopped, always be courteous and cooperative with the officer even if you are 100% clean of any type of alcohol or drugs, and even if you are certain that your driving did not show anything unusual. Never argue with the officer. Law enforcement is a tough, often nerve wracking job and the "attitude" you show to the officer can often make all the difference as to whether or not the encounter will be an unpleasant one for you. 6. Q: What will happen if the officer who pulls me over suspects thatI have been driving under the influence? A: The officer will ask you to get out of the car and will instruct you to perform a series of "field sobriety tests." These are standard physical ability measures and they include: (1) Reciting the alphabet from A to Z; (2) Closing your eyes and bringing both index fingers together; (3) Walking along a straight line; (4) Standing on one foot for a few seconds; (5) Picking up a coin dropped on the ground; In addition to these tests, some officers typically have certain field sobriety testing devices which they use. One such device is a breath meter which you blow into. another is a light to shine in your eyes in order to test your pupil reaction. It is very important that if you suffer from any chronic physical problems, such as difficulty with your balance, problems walking or with your legs or feet, that you inform the officer of these things before you go through the field sobriety tests. 7. Q: What happens if the officer believes that I have not performed the field sobriety tests satisfactorily? A: At that point you will be told that you are under arrest for driving under the influence. You will be hand cuffed, searched for weapons, placed in the back of the officer's car and taken to a jail for further tests. At the jail you will also be booked and held there until you post bail or until a judge releases you on your own recognizance without bail. Once again, as upsetting and as stressful as being arrested is, it is essential that you continue to act courteously and cooperatively with the officer. Do not argue, threaten or become belligerent in any way. This type of behavior will only make the experience even more unpleasant for you. 8. Q: What is a blood alcohol test? A: This is a physical procedure to determine how much alcohol you actually have in your system. There are three ways of doing this test: (1) Drawing a sample of blood from your arm; (2) Obtaining a urine sample; (3) Obtaining a breath sample by having you blow into a machine called a breathalyzer; (This is different from the field sobriety breath device described above. The breathalyzer is much more sophisticated and exact. You have the choice of which one of these three tests you will take. The only time your ability to choose which test you take can legally be restricted is if you are in a locality that simply does not have a breathalyzer. The officer is required to tell you that the option as towhich test you take is up to you. But quite often officers will try to pressure or browbeat a person into taking the blood test because this is the most effective procedure for the prosecution to use against a person in court. You do not have the right to refuse to take any test. Legally, the officer could hold you down and forcibly draw a blood sample from your veins. In practice this rarely happens except where an accident is involved which caused death or serious bodily injury. Instead, if you refuse to take a test, your driver's license is automatically suspended for oneyear. Also, in your trial, the jury will be told that you refused to take the test and the judge willinstruct the jury that they can consider your refusal as evidence of your guilt. 9. Q: What should I know in order to make an intelligent choice aboutwhich blood alcohol test I should take? A: As mentioned above, from the standpoint of the police and prosecution they will always prefer to have the more accurate sample of your actual blood to use against you as evidence in court. The least accurate and least reliable test is of a urine sample. However, if it has been some period of time from when you had your last drink to when you give the urine sample, the sample may test out to your disadvantage with an inaccurately high reading against you. This is because in such a situation, the alcohol content in your excreted urine is actually greater than the amount of alcohol you have remaining in your system. On the other hand, a breath test may show an inaccurately high reading against you if you take the breath test shortly after your last drink. This is because of the high alcohol content lingering in the mouth, esophagus, and the upper digestive system. If you have used any kind of breath spray, mouthwash or even should you burp shortly before the breath test, then the reading could be inaccurately high against you. Both the blood and the urine samples will also show the presence of drugs as well as alcohol. However a breath test can only determine alcohol content and nothing about drugs. Whichever test you take must be given to you within 3 hours of when you were driving. 10. Q: What are the penalties for driving while under the influence? A: Drunk driving penalties have become very severe in the past few years. For a first offense, the maximum possible penalties the court could impose are: (1) 6 months in the county jail: (2) $1,000 fine plus up to an additional $1,950 in penalty assessments; (3) 6 months driver's license suspension; (4) Your car impounded for 30 days. Second, third and fourth offenses within 7 years are punished by increasingly more harsh penalties. For third and fourth convictions, your license must be revoked for 3 and 4 years respectively. A fourth offense can even be prosecuted against you as a felony carrying a maximum term of 3 years in state prison along with your car being ordered sold and the proceeds going to the state. In addition to all ofthe above penalties, the price of auto insurance increases drastically after any conviction for a driving under the influence offense. The bottom line legal and practical advice to draw from all of all of the above is very clear: IT IS NEVER WORTH IT TO DRINK AND DRIVE. Â©1996 KPIX / CBS, Inc. A Westinghouse Company.

This clever robot can handle jobs beyond the capabilities of a 5-joint robot, including diagonal insertion operations and horizontal movement with the wrist maintained in a forward orientation. These capabilities make it easier to set up jigs and lay out equipment. The Movemaster line also includes many options, such as motor-operated hands and pneumatic hands, and even features models suited to oil-mist environments, as well as wall or ceiling mounted models. High Speed and High Precision Movemaster represents a major improvement in performance over conventional industrial robots, boasting a maximum resultant speed of 3500mm/sec and a position repeatability of +/-0.04mm. That means Movemastercan handle a wide range of real-world industrial applications. What's more, trajectory accuracy which is essential for jobs such as sealing, has been improved 2 to 3 times through the use of 32-bit microprocessor and a high-performance servo-amplifier. Improved Reliability and Easier Maintenance Movemaster uses AC servo-motors, thus eliminating the troublesome chore of replacing brushes which is the case with DC motors. Maintenance has also been simplified and reliability improved through the use of dust-proof oil seals and grease nipples for all joints. Easy to Use Movemaster uses an absolute encoder, which eliminates the need to return to the origin when power is turned on. This also solves the problem of interface by peripheral devices during origin setting, and contact by the robot arm hand attachment with the body of the robot. Thus, the robot can be used as soon as it is turned on. In addition, Movemaster is equipped with a teaching box complete with LCD display. That means it can be operated not only by using programs input from a personal computer, but also by a means of a teaching playback method, allowing programs to be created at the work site. Attractive Designs and Safe Operation Movemaster robots have a pleasant design and color which allows them to smoothly integrate into the work place. And because all wiring and piping has been installed inside the robots, they have a simple external form with no protruding parts. Movemaster robots are also equipped with various protection functions that ensure worry-free operation.

Certificate Program in Information Engineering The ISSE faculty are offering a new certificate program in Information Engineeringcombining the best of our very successful MS programs in Information Systemsand in Software Systems Engineering. The goal of the certificate is to allowstudents to gain knowledge and tools necessary for building advanced informationsystems. This program is open to our currently enrolled students, and toprospective students. The Graduate Certificate Program in Information Engineering (IE) has beendesigned for persons who are involved in the specification, design, implementationand management of data- and knowledge-intensive information systems. Theengineering of large-scale information systems requires knowledge and practicalexperience in areas such as database management systems, data modeling,knowledge acquisition, data/knowledge representation, and information andsoftware systems engineering. Further, large-scale information systems aredistributed over several types of networks: local-area networks, wide-areanetworks and inter-networks. In order to design and build such complex systems,information system engineering design methods and project management toolsand techniques are needed. In order to take the certificate courses, the applicant must have satisfiedour foundation course requirements, which may be waived if prior coursework has covered this material. IE Course Requirements To obtain the certificate, candidates must complete the following set ofcourses, achieving a grade of B or better in each, for a total of 15 credits: INFS 612: Data Communications and Distributed Processing INFS 614: Database Management SWSE 620: Software Requirements and Prototyping SWSE 621: Software Design and one of the following: SWSE 625: Software Project Management, or INFS 770: Methods for Information Systems Engineering. Students accepted into the IE Certificate Program are also accepted intothe MS in Information Systems program, provided they satisfy the additionalbusiness course foundation requirement. Certificate courses count towardsthe MS degree, and students may complete the degree requirements to obtainthe MS in Information Systems degree. Students already admitted to the MSin Information Systems program or the MS in Software Systems Engineeringprogram are also eligible to earn the IE Certificate, by taking appropriateelectives. ISSE Short Courses We are planning a collection of short courses to be offered in Summer 1996focusing on topics relevant to regional industry and government agencies.Topics include: Object-Oriented Information Systems, Software Analysis andDesign, Client-Server Systems and Advanced Database Systems.
