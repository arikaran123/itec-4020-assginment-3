It's also a vital component in cable'smove to being the first choice provider of access to interactiveservices.Yet in the UK where liberalisation occurred some five years ago, anastonishing 65 per cent of UK telecoms managers did not even know thatcable TV companies offered telephony services according to a recent CITResearch report, Business Telecoms trends in the UK 1995.This level of ineptitude in marketing, this gross failure to acceleratethe recouping of capital investment, is almost beyond belief. If thetelecommunications professionals don't even know that cable is here inthe telecom market is it any surprise that connection rates generallyare not higher? It means that the salesman is often trying to persuadepeople to buy something that many have never even heard of.The UK may be a test bed for liberalised cable technology, but probablythe biggest lesson learnt from the British experiment is how not tomarket cable telephony.Let your customers know what you are offering and what its benefits are- its so simple - isn't it? So why hasn't it happened in Britain?Because, CCA notwithstanding, the UK's cable operators are more dividedthan the former Yugoslavia. In five years they have never managed tocooperate sufficiently well to be able to put out a single nationalcampaign on terrestrial TV.And yet despite almost no one knowing cable telephony exists, it is aroaring success with penetration rates and income levels exceedingcatv. It makes you wonder how many people would know who to call toinstall cable TV, or even know if that is available in their area.No such problems in Chile or Russia, to name but two countries wherethe shortage of copper in the ground (what an ironic statement to makeabout Chile) means that integrated hybrid coax fibre from the catvcompanies is actually a preferred route to introduce telephony. Forcountries such as Holland where a mature cable network exists, the useof ASDL upgrading, or overlay technologies may look more appealing -certainly financially given the costs of laying cable.In truth there is not one simple answer, and local circumstances,including infrastructure and regulatory climate and historical/culturalfactors will dictate the route to converged interactive services.But there can surely be no doubting now that this is the destination ofthe superhighway, and whether you upgrade your current route or build anew one, without an on-ramp your country and economy is doomed tosuffer the plight of an information backwater.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

The PP says the Spanish parliament ischurlish rushing through the new cable law without the support of aparty which could be in power by spring, and claimed the bill was anti-competitive and advantaged Telefonica.Madrid, Valencia and Vigo, whose councils are held by PP, have giventhe go-ahead to public meetings awarding cable licences on their ownterms. Minister of public works Jose Borrell commented, "Investors inthese towns are taking a big risk because the licences are just fortelevision and not any other services, which must comply with the law."Other political parties warned of the possibility these licences beingnullified.A spokesman for Spanish Cable Telecommunications Association, Ademat,adds, "We are against this law as it is incomplete and does not preventmonopolies like Telefonica/Canal Plus." Cablevision, a joint venturebetween Telefonica and Canal Plus, started a 5,000 home testtransmission in Barcelona, running until January 31 offering 34channels for free.Cable operator Multitel says that Telefonica will retain its dominantposition as it can offer television and telephony services before otheroperators who must wait for liberalisation in 1998. Multitel added thatlimits on the number of subscribers should refer to the number of homespassed not subscribed ones. The cable bill states that no operator canhave over 1.5 million subscribers (almost 5 million homes passed) toprevent a company having 50 per cent of the potential cable market (12million homes).The PP has since said it will award cable licences at the beginning ofDecember in all 54 towns with over 100,000 inhabitants in which itgoverns. These licences would cover telecoms and catv, and run for 20years.Telefonica will also need to receive the PP's go-ahead to operate catv.However, the PP will not allow municipal investment in local cablenetworks, while foreign ownership will be restricted to 40 per cent.Sandy Saunderson has been appointed director of businesstelecommunications at Cable London with responsibility for businesstelephony and television.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Operating cash flow/EBITDA has more than doubled, from #2.2in 1994 to #6.9 million in 1995."We have entered the new fiscal year with 45 per cent of our networkbuilt-out for cable television and 39 per cent for both cabletelevision and residential telephone. The forthcoming year will bemarked by our transition from a high technology construction company toa full-service telecommunications company," says Louis Brunel,Videotron CEO and managing director.Total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 (compared to 1994)saw 38.6 per cent growth to #15.8 million; catv revenues jumped 26.5per cent to #6.5 million for the quarter with monthly revenue percustomer up from #20.25 to #21.28.

Junior minister of culture Ad Nuis said he would prefercable operators to come under general competition law, butparliamentarians appear to favour a new law directed specifically atthe sector, a view which gained extra support following the cableoperators' poor performance at a recent parliamentary hearing.Nuis received support for a separate proposal to transform Holland'spublic broadcasting system by merging the 30-plus pubcasters into asingle network by the year 2000. He proposed that the a newly-formedpublic body would offer one or two channels instead of the currentthree, with one of the services remaining commercial-free.Nuis appointed a committee to study the future of the Dutch publicbroadcasting system. Chaired by Democrat Mijndert Ververs, the groupwill make its recommendations by April, allowin further debate beforesummer's parliamentary recess.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

In a thinly-veiled warning toBSkyB, Taylor said that although companies which risk their capital andwork hard are entitled to a commensurate return, ignoring de factomonopolies could do as much harm as restoring legal monopolies. Thegovernment would tighten up its regulation of pay-TV and accesssystems.The head of the European Commission directorate general for competitionHerbert Ungerer also delivered a warning to 'gatekeepers' ofconditional access saying markets must first be liberalised beforedominant players can be allowed to join forces. "We cannot risk digitalinteractive TV or global mobile satellite systems markets being sewn upby defensive commercial moves before they are open to competition. Therisk of collusion and abuse of dominant position clearly outweighedpotential benefits of co-operation and convergence," said Ungerer,citing the proposed alliance between Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom andthe Kirch-group in Germany.De facto monopolies were also attacked by the director general of theUK telecommunications regulatory body Oftel, Don Cruickshank whocriticised BT's agreement with the labour party, saying that it wasanti-competitive in nature.Director-general of the CCA Richard Woollam described BT's deal withlabour as "an attempt to destabilise investor companies."During the show the UK's three largest cable companies, NynexCablecomms, Telewest and Bell Cablemedia announced they are to launchthe first phase of the multimedia services trial in January 1996 tolead to the development of commercial applications, as well asestablish standards to achievement the equivalent of a single nationalnetwork for multimedia broadband services.Comcast is to roll-out digital music service Music Choice to itsCleveland and Darlington franchises following its successful launch inBirmingham adding a potential 225,000 homes to Music Choice's reach.Scottish Television is to launch a cable channel, the Scottish Channel,to be entirely made in Scotland, following the channel's recentalliance with Flextech.The Travel channel launched an Internet Web site in conjunction withits US sister company, The Travel Channel.

But catv penetration at 18.9 per cent falling from 19.5 percent, and significantly short of the industry average of 21 to 22 percent. Television revenues doubled - to #26.4 million, and turnover forthe period also doubled, to #57.1 million.Saunders comments, "We are not satisfied with the level of penetrationand this is a high priority issue for us - we place a great emhpasis onkeeping our churn rates down, probably the lowest in the industry. Whatis critical is customer retention. Our last published telephony churnfigure was 15.8 per cent - industry estimates suggest 12 per cent isaccounted for by people moving house and those taken off for bad debt.We don't really make it easy as we have a 12 month contract, stronglyencourage direct debit, and we don't offer free or discountedintroductory services.""The product mix is good and getting better with channels like Disney,and there will be several more coming on in 1996 when we are confidentthe industry will break through the barrier. It has grown faster thanthe US, developing a multichannel service in just four years."Nynex was criticised by other cable companies when, along withTelewest, it entered into a separate agreement with BSkyB. Saunderssays, "It was the right thing to do at the time; after Oftel'sintervention, the rest of the industry ended up with better terms."Bundling of programmes is an issue that has to be addressed. Mypersonal view is that catv will evetnually become an a la carteservice. As a viewer, I want to pay for what I want, when I want it.People are currently being forced to take channels that they don'twant.""Some companies have been successful with packages and others with a lacarte so it is not clear which is the best system. There has to be somelatitude in programme packaging and this will be a key factor ingetting revenues from our customers."On Murdoch, Saunders said, "You have to admire what he has done - hebet his business on satellite in the UK. But you must question theHollywood studios signing up films for such a long time - and PremierLeague TV.""As individual operators we probably haven't done a good job ofexplaining our excellent product mix. Our marketing has not been sogood. On telephony - we have brought true competition to BT and havehelped the end user. We have considerble experience in the telecomsworld - its not new to us. People are amazed at the cost savings (ofswitching to cable).""Number portability due in 1996 could add five to 10 per cent of homespassed, increasing our penetration 25 per cent ."Cable telephony probably won't retain its current levels of costdifferential next century as regulators bring BT costs down - then thedifferentiation will be the service provider. "Our philosophy is to getthe customer for life. Both the level of service and the service rangehas to be the latest and the best - you can't have a failing network."Would Nynex use ADSL technology to bring (existing) networks to thestandard of fibre? "No. In the US we are committing to change coppernetworks for fibre. The Select Party review which said early entry byBT into the entertainment market would result in #10 billion to upgradeto fibre described something which it is going to have to do anyway.""A billion pounds was wiped off cable stock when (oppositionleader)Blair made his unclear statement. What will they (BT) do to help thehospitals, schools or libraries that they have connected? We are theunsung heroes, connecting them today."There was a silver lining however as, "It was a key part of Blair'sspeech and so it was good to get cable on the political agenda. It hasa raised public awareness of cable."On new technologies, Saunders explained, "We have commercialinteractive services on trial and have talked with a lot of people, butnothing is concluded at this stage. There is a market requirement forgames, but it has to be packaged at the right price for the user. Wewelcome PPV coming in and expect to have something in place in 1996. Weexpect time shifting will also be a great winner, provided as a form ofpay per view."Lack of commercial interactive services reflects perceived marketreadiness, availability of service providers and pricing rather thanimplementation issues explains Saunders, declaring, "Technology is nota problem, we have a network that will take whatever you want put downit."Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Cablefranchise areas are exclusive and interconnect charges are regulated,so profitability is ensured, which has spurned on the UK build rate,leaping 55 per cent to 850,000 homes passed in the first half of 1995.Long term forecasts for cable telephony penetration are 38 per cent by2003, but the average residential penetration is 25 per cent thoughDiamond Cable is achieving 45 per cent. This has been achieved prior tonumber portability which should be in force in 1996 - forecast to boostpenetration by 6 to 8 per cent. "The lack of portability acts as adisincentive to changing supplier and if this barrier is removed I amconvinced that suppliers will strive to improve their services toattract new customers and improve efficiency," says Don Cruickshank,director general of Oftel.Business telephony penetration varies wildly between operators, fromsingle figures to 23 per cent, and it accounts for 45 per cent ofrevenues at Diamond Cable.BT has a 90 per cent share of the #12.8 bn ($20.2 bn) UK telephonymarket. But since opening up, this relatively small market has becomehighly competitive with multiple long distance operators, multiplewireless operators, and a growing number of local exchange operators(BT, Mercury, Colt and the cable operators) hence there is expected tobe pressure for consolidation. Goldman Sachs suggests that UK cablerevenues (including catv and interactive services) are set to rise1,900 per cent from #350 m ($553 m) in 1994 to #6.7 bn ($10.59 bn) by2003.Interconnect pricing is controlled by Oftel, but if and when BT loosesmore than 25 per cent of the market (expected around 2001), currentlegislation says cable will have to pay an Access Deficit Charge,contributing toward the subsidy that BT claims it makes in localinterconnect pricing - though by that time open competition isexpected.Meanwhile, BT is expected to increase its competition for the localloop on the basis of Oftel dictated pricing - annual price reductionsequal to inflation (RPI) minus a productivity factor of 7.5 per centthrough to 1997. This equals some #400 m of annual price reductions,but BT staffing is falling by 10,000 per year saving #250 m withfurther savings in office space etc while lines are growing by 2 percent annually. BT would need to spend #15 billion ($23.7 bn) to rebuildits network with fibre optic cabling. Most regional Bell OperatingCompanies in the US have announced switched broadband overlay trials,rather than using ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line)technology, and so BT was expected to upgrade its network to fibre. Buta potential future Labour government (currently poll favourites) maylegislate to make it attractive to BT to interconnect with cable forbroadband services in the local loop rather than replicate the cablecompanies' network.Telecommunication companies Mercury and Energis are not seen as localloop competitors, but their direct competition with BT in the longdistance interconnect should reduce interconnect charges to cablecompanies. BT has introduced a range of incentives to maintain itscustomers and also sends direct mail and calls people in newly cabledareas to dissuade them from subscribing to cable telephony. It has also(up until now) refused customer's number portability to cable, andmarkets satellite dishes through its BT shops.Videotron and Diamond Cable have responded by offering free local callsbetween cable subscribers, and in all categories, cable telephony hasresponded to BT price cuts, maintaining a pricing differential of 10 to15 per cent below BT in every tariff category, with Nynex CableCommssaying it will maintain a 25 per cent discount to BT for the mediumterm.Another problem for BT is that it is the higher usage customers whichit is loosing. BT's average monthly residential spend is #18.50compared to cable's residential telephony spend of #24. This may resultin targeted price reductions from BT in relation to specificcompetitors and sectors, but it is not allowed to vary its pricinggeographically. However, it can use strategies such as price discountsto selected numbers which are also BT, so that one person switchingwould affect a whole circle of friends.Both usage and the number of lines in the market is expandingsufficiently to more than make up for the price declines as fallingprices stimulate usage growth.In the face of falling prices, the report says success in thetelecommunications market will increasingly be driven by productinnovation, itself driven by software and marketing which highlightsthese innovations.Cable companies are buying the latest generation of switches to leadthe introduction of new services including voice mail, and Teen Talk(Bell Cable) with different numbers on the same line.The introduction of Centrex in business sites provides phantom PBXinternal communications solutions to form the local switch.In London the interconnect local group has launched IntegratedCommunications Network capital wide, offering private networks andcircuits and high speed data links plus standard telephony. This isexpected to be followed by the launch of a national cable businesstelephony initiative with its own branding, expected within 18 months,possibly using a company such as Energis for its long distanceoperator.BT and Mercury interconnection charges including local switching makeinvestment by cable companies in their own switches not only viable butvirtually inevitable, and most now have their own local switching(Digital Local Exchanges). For an optimal nationally switched network,a national joint venture between cable companies and perhaps a thirdparty is postulated.Cable companies are advised to bid for wireless local loop licences intheir own areas for both defensive and offensive reasons, as the maincost is the headend switching which could be merged with the catvheadend - and wireless would extend cable's telecommunication serviceinto rural areas.For US companies looking to replicate their success in the UK backhome, costs will be higher as they will have to upgrade existing cableplant through hybrid fibre/coax rebuilds and the deployment ofswitching, independent power and subscriber network interface devices.Abstracted from UK Cable Market, available from Goldman Sachs, price#295.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Itsuggests that the local loop should be owned by independent companiesconcerned only with providing local access for any telecom operator,and that these companies should get a set exclusive period in returnfor upgrading the network to handle multimedia services.BT in the UK saw its labour force cut by some 40 per cent (100,000jobs) following privatisation, hence there is strong political andunion pressure to prevent a repetition in continental Europe's PTTs.The Association of Private European Cable Operators (Apec) has calledon Europe's regulatory authorities to allow catv operators to directlyinterconnect their networks, not via telecom leased lines but by theirown means - similar to the interconnect groups now being established inthe UK. It has also called for liberalisation of telephony onalternative infrastructures before January 1998, with the January 1996limited liberalisation as merely a timid first step.Again, mirroring the UK model, Apec has called for seven to 10 yearperiods of exclusivity rather than allowing public telecomsorganisations to enter entertainment markets as sooon as cableoperators enter voice telephony, citing the PTTs dominant postion anddecades-old monopolies as advantages to be overcome. A quick solutionto the problems of number portability and universal service are alsocalled for.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Nortel inthe UK is enlarging its product portfolio to meet this demand byoperators to deploy advanced data and multimedia services to businessand residential communities.Flexibility is an essential part of Nortel's Cornerstone range whichcomprises a family of coax access systems that interface seamlesslywith its switching, data and transmission products and can be tailoredto specific catv franchise requirements.Cornerstone allows catv operators to introduce multiple services on totheir networks incrementally.Cornerstone Voice and Cornerstone Data, enable existing HFC networks tocarry additional services, generating new revenue through controlledincremental investment.The Voice option enables narrowband services, from standard telephonyto advanced CLASS (customer local area signalling) features - such ascaller ID and call waiting - to be delivered over standard HFC plant.Transmission quality, reliability and grade of service can exceed thecurrent copper telephony infrastructure.Cornerstone Data enables catv operators to enter the growing homeworking market, delivering high-speed data communications servicesacross their existing network, letting the service provider offer ahighly-competitive quality of service and feature set.The emphasis is on delivery at a reasonable cost to subscribers, withonly minor modifications to existing cable plant and low capitalinvestment, even at low penetration levels.By sharing bandwidth among a number of users, the Data option providesa high peak rate to each user as most users only need network accessfor a short time, downloading Web pages, or graphics files from anoffice server. It uses ATM between the head-end and the data port toensure bandwidth is fairly distributed between users.Cornerstone Data also lets operators charge users for the bandwidththey take, not their connect time, allowing subscribers to browsewithout having to disconnect then re-connect to a service and withoutincurring bills for idle connect time.Future Cornerstone products undergoing field trials offer multimediaand wireless applications. Multimedia applications include highlyinteractive services such as educational VOD, home shopping andinteractive games.Cablevision Lightpath, the telephony subsidiary of Cablevision Systems,is piloting and plans wide-scale deployment of services based onCornerstone Voice over its catv network in the New York City area. NewBrunswick Telephone is the first implementation of multimediaapplications with services due to include educational VOD, interactivehome shopping and advanced telecommunications services.In October, Bell Cablemedia chose Nortel's ATM Magellan Passport switchto run BCM's pilot data service in its London franchise area. This newnetwork includes Internet access, videoconferencing, LANinterconnection and voice over ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode).Magellan Passports are being deployed alongside Nortel Rapport Internetaccess dial-up switches.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Gad Line saw the potential to take advantage of the two-waybroadband coax/fibre network infrastructure by utilising it to meet thedemand for efficient two-way video, voice and data communicationchannels.Its voice/data system incorporates communal telephony, public telephonyemergency and security features, data transfer including facsimiles,the Internet etc and utility management. The utility feature has beenimplemented by a German electric company to monitor electricityconsumption, and an exclusive residential complex in Brazil uses thesystem for its security and internal telephony features. Othervoice/data systems have been installed internationally. The system'slargest contract is for the telephonic networking of Tianjin, China,with its population of 8 million.By mid-1996 Gad Line expects to have pilot schemes starting on itsdigital system for the transfer of E1/T1, long-distance learning, homeshopping, VOD etc utilising microelectronic integrated technologywithin one unified system.The existing analogue voice/data system utilises frequencies which arenot occupied by the cable television channels over the catv networkwith FDM technology with FSK modulation. The system comprises asubscriber modem as the basic unit which is sited at the home or officeof the use. This unit interfaces between a standard telephone, fax orcomputer and the catv network. It blocks noisy frequencies, allocatesthe free frequencies to the subscribers, and is used for assigning adchanging subscriber ID numbers.Trunk interface units and trunk protocol converters perform the linkand the protocol conversion between the Public Switched Telephonynetwork and the telephony over cable system.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

There is no telephony overlay in integrated delivery - onlythe hybrid fibre coax cable TV network is built. An RF modem in thehome connects to the incoming coax and provides a master socket and anoutlet at the set top box for cable TV. FPN's 10001 product has provenitself in the UK, reducing overall build costs.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCABLE BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetDecember 1, 1995LETTING THE LOOP LOOSETerry Meredith of West End discusses integrating telephony and TV in acable network using HFC with orthogonal frequency division multiplexingto overcome capacity limits on the local loopThe initial premise is that operators using hybrid fibre/coax (HFC) cansave between 10 to 30 per cent in costs (depending on the country)compared to an overlay approach. Using HFC, operators with installedcatv networks can avoid the civils cost of cable laying, gainingprivacy and security, which must be ensured by HFC due to the changefrom a traditional copper star wired network to a shared star/busarchitecture.Bandwidth efficiency is essential. The return path of a catv network istypically five to 55 MHz, and an integrated HFC architecture must packcircuits into this bandwidth without lowering the grade of service orneeding the local loop to be engineered.Reliability of catv networks must also be assured, enabling them tosupport lifeline telephony services, and so power plant must be plannedto provide the necessary levels of resilience, with home unitsproviding various powering options. Also, integrated TV/telephony mustprovide flexible end to end service provision.When looking at the architectural options available, HFC is the firstchoice due to its broadband capability, with RF catv designs able toprovide multiple services on a single network. Standard catvarchitecture with a bolt-on approach is the most cost effectivesolution, eliminating construction, minimising cost and deliveringservices to the customer as soon as they sign on.In a catv network which has a return path implemented, telephony (plusdata and interactive services) can be added using the WestBound 9600Broadband Access Platform by connecting a WestBound 9645 BroadbandManager at the headend and one of a range of subscriber drops at theuser end. The WestBound 9600 supports multiple value added servicessuch as internet access and telephony. Every 64kB/s channel from theheadend is guaranteed a path in the same way as a traditional coppernetwork PTT, so there is no blocking and the integral cross connectfunctionality at the head end is an important factor for leased linenetworks.It is possible to pack 480 x 64K channels into one 8MHz catv channel ina totally on-blocking way eg 12 MHz supporting 720 channels provide forgreater than 100 per cent penetration in a typical HFC catv design. Andthere are a range of other benefits accruing from use of orthogonalfrequency division multiplexing - utilising 500 carriers (tones) each2kHz wide and carrying 10kB/s of information. If ingress hits one ofthe 2kHz bands, its affect is minimal, unlike single carrier systemssuch as QPSK.Security features include unique frequency allocation per subscriber,and inherent random scrambling, similar to PCM AMI techniques.Multiple integrated services for the residential and business marketinclude supporting digital or analogue telephony, with Centrex working,leased line services for telephony and data, Lan interconnect serviceswith optional integral frame relay connectivity; teleworkinghome/office connections, remote Lan, speeds up to 256kB/s; Infonetservices to add information services and gateways to third parties suchas the Internet. Future uses are expected to incorporate multimediaservices networks and the architecture - if not the infrastructure - isalready established to handle these services.Continental Europe is particularly enthusiastic about employing 'bolt-on' solutions to introduce telephony while the UK has an overlaymentality, whereas in Eastern Europe and Latin America there arebottlenecks in their local loops, with not enough copper in the ground,are finding it more cost effective to increase telephony via catvdevelopment. "We are aiming to be the local loop company in thesecountries," says Meredith.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

This will include joint development ofinterfaces for EISI standard countries, and joint development of nextgeneration broadband platform solutions"Our overlay system uses Nokia's SDH overlay for data using ACM2 - wecan take overlay networks to integrated networks," explained ADC'sLynne High, adding that the cooperation meant the companies were ableto expand more rapidly, from a video product today to the incorporationof voice/data from the same company.ACM2 is a two megabit per second primary rate family for voice and dataservices, while the Homeworx platform transports both digital andbroadband signals as well as narrowband telephony and data servicesover HFC. ADC has also formed a telecom alliance with Hitachi telecom,initially focused on sales and marketing, offering an end-to-endsolution for customers, including marketing Hitachi's Synchronousoptical network and ATM equipment with ADC's Soneplex and Homeworxbroadband access/transport platforms.

Under the company's plan, cable television would remain separatefrom other devices such as computers and telephones but those deviceswould be almost disposable. Network connected devices would download all the software and systemsneeded to run direct from the network when switched on. The cableproviders couldchange systems often as the devices re-configurethemselves each time they are switched on. Set-top boxes being used byBT in its interactive TV trials are the first examples of suchproducts.Ellison suggests that "there is nothing less important than movies ondemand (MOD)" and he sees education, news on demand and commerce as farmore important, saying no cable company could justify building a newnetwork for Movies On Demand.Ipitek Corporation was showing its new software system that allowscable companies to make use of existing connections to satellite farms,TV stations and other facilities by offering to route traffic betweenthem and charge for the service. Using new computer software inconjunction with the California-based company's line up of Fibrehub andImtran Fibre Optic Transmission System units, the system offers moreflexibility and remote control of each point on the network from asingle PC.ADC Telecommunications announced a development agreement with Nokia andshowed its line of Homeworx broadband access platforms (also see ADCarticle this issue).Ortel was receiving interntional interest for its linear opticstechnology. The recently developed System-1000 unit allows operators totake the complete frequency range from a satellite head end and send itup to 40 km to the cable company. Ortel's Richard Mullikin, businessmanager of satellite communications, said, "Ortel's System 1000 iscapable of accepting greater frequency ranges, it is cost-effective andcan be installed in a day."Nortel launched Cogent at the show, an independent subsidiary ofNortel, created to provide a complete consultancy for companies wishingto build new networks or upgrade existing ones.Brian Gowers, managing director of Cogent, explained the company wouldsupply its own personnel to initially come up with a network plan forthe desired system and, once agreed on, would offer contracts forsupply of the equipment.Gowers stressed that it wasn't just a way to sell Nortel equipment,pointing out that it chose Alcatel access equipment. He added tht noneof Nortel's competitors had refused to provide detailed technicalspecifications for he bides and tht showed that they al recognisedCogent as being independent.As the system is built, Cogent supply key management personnel and willtake charge of hiring and training of employees in all areas of thebusiness from operation to sales.The relationship built up with Cogent continues through to after-systemlaunch with Gowers adding, "We wouldn't want to exit less than 12months after launch. Trying to step out too soon is a recipe to fallover. It is a long term relationship."The expo also saw the public debut of several new multimedia operatingsystems. Sony unveiled its new system, Apertos, complete with afuturistic looking set top box dubbed Pecchi, the PersonalEntertainment Computer and Communicator for Home Interaction.Apertos offers a system on which operators can build completemultimedia and video on demand services while the Pecchi box acts likea traditional set top box as the interface between the network and inhome equipment which can now include a television set and radio tunerplus computer or cable telephone.Also competing was NEC Corporation which debuted a system that includeda broadband access network management system for fibre- to-the-curb andfibre-to-the-building, and a service management system for VOD.The ITU used the occasion to release its 250 page second WorldTelecommunication Development Report on the state of telecoms aroundthe world. Among its main finding was that, internationally, the numberof new subscribers to cable television is continuing to rise.In 1994 14.5 million cable subscribers were added, exceeding the 13.7million rise in 1993. According to the ITU figures, almost 173 millionhomes world-wide are now cabled including 76 million in the USA, 57million in Asia and 38 million in Europe.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCABLE BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetDecember 1, 1995INTEGRATION ON TRIALAnnual revenues for telephony via cable are now #330 million in the UK,and forecast to exceed #1 billion by the year 2000, but this successrelies heavily on the capital needed to build the system. Previouslyoperators had to install an entirely separate network fortelecommunications, but integrated cable telephony (RF to theKerb/Home) based on transmission of the telephony signals within theexisting network lets the telephony system share the duct, streetcabinets, power and cabling of broadcast services.Hughes Network Systems has tested its own integrated cable telephonysystem, called Cable Telephony Transport System (CTTS), in anoperational environment.Details are confidential but results are positive. CTTS has performedwell, delivering a reliable telephony service over the HFC network.Telephony via an HFC network depends on two key subsystems. Itcomprises a head end unit installed at or close to the catv head end,and a number of remote nodes. Each remote node contains at least oneremote interface unit and primary multiplexer and servicing at least 30subscribers. Concentration can be added to increase the number of linescarried over the network. At the head end, traffic is presented as EI(or TI) streams for direct connection, or via further transmissionlinks, to an exchange switch.A cross connect facility in the headend enables grooming andconsolidation of traffic carried over the network. A network managerprovides configuration control and status and alarm monitoring. Theremote node is co-located with the catv equipment, usually sited in astreet side cabinet or in the utility room of an appartment. The homelink is made by copper pair to a standard telephone outlet eliminatinginstallation of equipment in the home.Alternatively, diplexers can be used to add the telephony signal to thecoaxial drop cable so that no additional wiring is needed. This allowssome 30 to 60 homes to be served by a single remote node. By usingcommon circuitry the cost is shared over several lines, as opposed to'RF to the home' where each telephone line has its own dedicatedequipment. RF to the kerb suits medium to high penetration areaswhereas 'RF to the home' is best used where penetration remains low.Upgrade of the service, adding customers and maintenance, are simpleand quick, virtually eliminating home visits.System power and backup is controlled by the operator. The system isalso very secure. Only signals designated for a given customer aredelivered to the premises so one customer cannot assume the identity ofanother. For the business user, a range of line card types can befitted to the PMUX to provide ISDN and other data services. Also theRIU can be used directly (without the PMUX) to provide 2048kbt/sservice.And the system provides the infrastructure for interactive services inthe future. With the Hughes system, utilisation of bandwidth is veryefficient and can be configured for either narrow or broadbandservices. Later cable modems will offer high performance ethernet overthe cable network providing high speed data communications plusentertainment services, Internet and general on-line information.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Time Warner Communications, Adelphia, Time WarnerEntertainment/Advanced Newhouse and Telewest are also evaluatingCablespan for cable telephony.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCABLE BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetDecember 1, 1995PERSONAL SERVICE SOUGHTIn this fast moving industry, cable operators cannot presume to competewith the telcos on price alone, so what is available for the cableoperators to enable them to maintain their penetration of the telephonymarket? Tony Daniels reportsTelcos are readying themselves for an era of free bandwidth, and itwon't be long before free (or extremely cheap) calls becomecommonplace. Even Arno Penzias, vice president of research at BellLabs, strikes a cautionary note, "AT&T Telcos should be terrified ofthe prospect of free bandwidth. But the answer is change - and changeis coming." The strategy of the cable operators must be to move awayfrom marketing telephony offerings on price to a value-added servicebasis.UK cable operators offer savings on charges, itemised billing, and theservice advantages of a local network. Industry estimates put thenumber of telephone exchange lines installed at 1.2 million, in over 50regional franchise areas. This compares with 5.8 million broadbandhomes passed (1.1 million subscribers), a telephony penetration rate of20.7 per cent.Goldman Sachs is a little more conservative, putting the expectednumber of cable telephony subscribers by 2000 at 5.1 million (ie 15 percent).More value must be offered to meet forecast penetration by theend of the decade.The CCA expects cable telephony to increase from 1.3 million lines bythe end of 1995 to 5.7 million lines by the end of 2000, and acorresponding increase in telephony penetration from 29 to 51 per cent,with business cable telephony lines to rise from 8 to 12 per cent by2000 - not much in terms of installed lines, but business-derivedrevenue will be significantly higher. Centrex services could providesmall businesses with several advantages, giving callers the impressionof a much larger and efficient organisation. Key features include arange of call transfer and forwarding options, including 'ring backwhen free.'Bell Cablemedia has taken a lead in developing innovative tariffing andservice packages including call waiting and call barring, with voicemail following swiftly behind. BT subscribers can get all of theseservices - and more besides, but BCM will soon be offering a dual-number and dual-ringing tone service, so that users can differentiatean incoming business call from a residential one.Data is the obvious way that cable companies can capitalise, with fastfile transfer for business users and high-speed Internet connectionsfor homes. Motorola Multimedia has done significant work on cablemodems and BCM is working on its caller line identification (CLI)service, including the manufacture of specially branded displaytelephone sets. Hughes Network Systems is advocating an integratedtelephony over cable service, which offers full E1 (2Mbit/s) from thehead-end to the curb-side, as opposed to the traditional overlaynetwork. Telewest trialed the equipment, and has recommended that itsfranchisees take up the system.According to Richard Stevens, business development manager for cable atHughes Network Systems, "Telewest is holding back on the level ofdeployment until they have more information; they are now testing theirown processes, which in turn will determine operational costs. "At thehead-end there is an E1 interface to the switch, and each networkedswitch can support up to 20 remote curb-side nodes, again connected byE1 lines to a mux card in the cabinet. Such systems enable cableoperators to deliver high speed data, such as file transfer or Internetaccess, to the SoHo and residential markets. Although according toStevens, "We are likely to see such applications happening in the USfirst, with some roll-out in 1996, but real roll-out will not be until1997."Personal numbering is still a few years away and subject to regulatoryclearance, but Ericsson is promoting its 'universal personaltelecommunications' service, which is a value-added feature of itsintelligent network switches. The service gives a subscriber a singlenumber, which he then uses for home, business and mobile purposes.What is in effect a 'virtual' personal numbering system is availabletoday from TPS of the UK. Its Personal Assistant value added systemintegrates different services, media and equipment under a singlepersonal number. Subscribers can consolidate their work, home andmobile phone and fax numbers on one number, managing incoming andoutgoing calls to their own requirements.It also offers 'find me' call completion, caller screening, fullyfeatured voicemail, fax store and forward, 'cardless' phone card, andSMS support. The system knows where you are and when you are available,and will announce calls so that they can be screened. At any timeduring a call, the subscriber can transfer the caller to the voice-mailservice, to be acted upon at a more convenient time.

Rich D'Amato chiefspokesman for the US National Cable Television Association expectsincremental investment of, "About $25 billion (#16 billion) over thenext five to six years to enable cable plant to provide both telephonyand robust video or online services."Finance is sought for the new services, but the cablecos must becompetitive telecommunications providers, so they are demanding a levelplaying field to compete with the telcos. Some states currently allowcablecos into local telephony and some do not, but there is atelecommunications bill now in Congress. For two years the spectre ofDBS hitting cable profits has gnawed away at cable's ability to raisecapital. The American cable industry has revenues of $23 billionyearly, compared to the telcos' $100 billion, so unequal competitionwould allow the telcos to swamp cable with their financial clout. Ratecaps were put on US cable prices in 1992."Should the legislation be passed,' says D'Amato, you will see cableoperators plan to get into telephony and investment in technologies toincrease capacity and signal quality. Remove regulatory uncertaintiesand the bankers will lend money."The proposed deregulation lifts the rate caps imposed in 1992,overrides state legislatures and provides for competitive cross-entry.The White House is not pleased with the thought of lifting cable ratecaps, but wouldn't veto it if it was well supported. It may be passedthis session or held until next year.Increased capacity is sought by US cablecos to offer consumers a bundleof services including video, telephony, online access and interactiveservices."We telephony see as part of our future, carrying us into a leadershipposition in telecommunications. It will include video services,interactivity and access to home banking, shopping, energy management -the services required from a full service telecommunications provider,"says D'Amato. "Cable and telephone companies will be offering verysimilar services."Digital video compression will be introduced in 1996, meantime channelcapacity is being increased through fibre deployment. "Channel capacityand system rebuilds come down to the deployment of fibre and theaddition of digital boxes. Digital boxes come down to manufacturersproducing them in sufficient quantities at affordable prices," saysD'Amato.TeleCommunications Inc (TCI) is introducing compression on a market bymarket basis in mid1996, but other major cable operators are holdingback. Time Warner Cable and Continental Cablevision have adopted a'wait and see' strategy."Digitisation is unquestionably an important trend," says Time WarnerCable spokesman Mike Luftman. "But we don't have any plans to take anyof our cable systems digital in the near term. Our Orlando ServiceNetwork finds out what digital services people want and we use ourupgraded networks to introduce more analogue cable services, localtelephony and online computer services now. Ultimately a great deal ofTV is going to be digital but we are increasing our analogue capacitythrough fibre rebuilds first."Luftman says that close to 50 per cent or Time Warner, (TW) systemshave been fibred and more than 90 per cent will have been rebuilt bythe year 2000. He points out that while rebuilding with fibre is costefficient in urban and suburban areas, smaller operators in rural areaswill probably opt for the introduction of DVC with minimal fibre. "Somesystems in rural areas don't see the payback in fibre rebuilds. Forthem digitisation is more important because it will allow them todeliver more channels in the near future and it is a cost efficient wayto get channel capacity without rebuilding their systems."For TW, the prospect of bundling services is important. "People will bepresented with at least two choices of providers of bundled servicesand being in the market first is a substantial advantage."There's no question that cable will get there first because of thenature our networks" says Luftman. He sees deregulation as providingopportunities, rather than easing a credit crunch. "We don't have acapital problem. Deregulation is important because we need access totelephony through deregulation to gain a fair and competitive playingfield. Telephony is very important. Once you have these upgradednetworks you have this tremendous opportunity. It would beirresponsible not to take advantage of the opportunity that localtelephone offers. If telephone is going to compete in television thenit is important to get up and compete in their business as soon aspossible."David Fellows, Continental Cablevision's vice president of technologyand engineering sees it differently, "We are the only major MSO whichhas not placed orders for DVC set tops. I want to be within six monthsof a real delivery date, to be able to look at a box and kick it andknow what the price is before signing. We will be rolling out digitalcompression with the rest, but at the moment we view that as a high endtier, ten per cent of our customers."Continental is waiting for the price to come down before going digital."Digital boxes seem to be north of $400 for just a decompression box,not an Orlando full service interactive box. And for $400 I don't thinkadding a hundred channels as opposed to 20, is going to pay for them."Instead, Continental plans to introduce advanced analogue boxes whichpermit the use of a virtual channel which can act as an advancedprogram guide or a weather or traffic channel.Through its participation in Primestar, the cable consortium DTHoperator, Continental has concluded that you don't need hundreds ofchannels. "We are doing more market testing, but it appears if you havejust ten different movies on with start times every hour, that's goodenough. You don't have to go to start times of every five minutes and alibrary of ten thousand titles to get enough revenue to pay for ananalogue box," says Fellows.Continental is launching an IP0 and applying to various states foralternative local telephony provider status. 'The pre-emption of statelaw by a federal bill would make explaining our plans to analystssimpler, then we would have to go through a state by state plan.In Canada deregulation will not finally arrive until local rates arerebalanced to make local telephony profitable. Long distance chargescurently subsidise local rates. Until the technology arrives and isinstalled to permit interconnectivity and number portability, telcosand cable companies will not be allowed into each other's businesses.Financial analysts warned the market to avoid Canadian cable operatorsdue to the threat of DBS and telco competition, but this hasn'tthwarted their ability to raise capital. Colin Watson, president ofRogers Cablesystems Ltd, Canada's largest MSO says, "The capital marketis certainly adequate. We have managed financings in the US and expectto continue to do that. There is a lot of regulatory uncertainty on theissue of cable and telephone competition which I believe hasdestabilised the financial markets but it doesn't do anything to thefundamentals. The informed investor is very enthusiastic about cable."Rogers has ordered digital set top boxes from General Instrument andplans to start rolling them out in the third quarter of 1996. Rogersplans to continue rebuilding its networks until it reaches 625MHz whichis effectively the coming North American standard, providing 90channels. It plans to use 70 channels for analogue services and 20channels for DVC at a ratio of 12 to 1, eventually giving it 240digital channels.Shaw, Canada's second largest MSO, is building out its systems untilthey reach 550MHz. It is in negotiations for digital set top boxes andplans to start introducing compression in mid-1996.Rogers' Colin Watson is optimistic. about the potential effect ofdigital services on revenue, "There is a relatively flat growth intraditional cable company revenues but there will be tremendous growthin revenues from highspeed access for computers and, subsequently,telephone revenues. Within 10 years new services will provide 50 percent of our revenue and that's conservative. "Michael D'Avella, Shaw's senior vice-president for planning predicts,"In five years from now new services will provide 30 to40 per cent ofrevenues."Telephony is seen as a 'must have' to compete in the one stop shoppingmarket beyond 2000, but most American MSOs believe that immediategrowth will come from providing access to online services withsuperfast cable modems."We already have high speed access in New England and next year we willstart selling the service. Nobody else does it at the speeds we canoffer so you aren't taking a telephone customer and trying to explainwhy your dial tone sounds better," says Continental's Fellows."Adding in enhanced PPV and revenue from digital services, I think thatin five years, new services might provide 50-60 per cent of revenue,"says FellowsHe believes these services will migrate from the PC to the TV. "Thecompanies we are talking to are aimed at the computer and I believecompelling interactive services will emerge from the PC arena and cuttheir teeth there, then versions will be transferred to TV. For homebanking you want a keyboard in front of you."For many MSOs, digitisation means satellite-proofing. "It means we canhave a service that is much better than any satellite offering," saysWatson, "We will have many many many more channels of PPV, a fullydigitised spectrum and all the local channels."Cable telephony means increased revenues, but more importantly it letscablecos to compete with the telcos as they enter video. Onlineservices seem poised as cable's great potential in the US. High speedaccess is a service cablecos can provide now. "We believe the growth inPCs and the absolutely astounding interest in gaining access to theWorld Wide Web and Internet are the next bonanza in terms of growthopportunities," says Michael D'Avella.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

And the government's emphasis on promoting its hightech industries mean that Taiwan is not just a low cost 'clone product'maker, but is increasingly conducting its own research and development.One manufactuerer with a 25 year track record is Trans Electric whichspecialises in catv/smatv systems. Its annual sales of over 10,000 catvheadend modulators make the company the dominant Asian supplier. TransElectric's PX set top converter is used by half the domestic market andinternationally it has seen sales of over 3.5 million sets.The company has its own catv technology centre and laboratory inTaiwan, the first in the country, supporting its research anddevelopment and quality control as well as providing a support andservice centre for its customers. Trans Electric is also the salesdistributor for Philips Magnavox catv distribution products and thelicensed manufacturer of the Zenith addressable scrambling system.The company portfolio comprises headend equipment; distributionequipment and subscriber equipment.Lead Universal International Corporation, with its ChainfordElectronics Company factory, manufactures a broad range of catv partsand accessories including both passive and active products ranging fromoutdoor trunk amplifiers and line extenders to indoor splitters.Exemplifying the Taiwanese approach to high levels of customer service,Manager Kennex Huang says, "Our thirteen years in this field haveenabled us to provide high performance reliable equipment withcompetitive pricing. We are also competitive on service, with a quickdelivery time of three weeks after receiving payment. Our recentlydeveloped 750 MHz amplifier will be entering production in 1996." Thecompany produes various types of amplifiers, line extenders, powerinserters/combiners, line splitters, couplers, directional taps, powersupplies and catv connectors.There are also many tightly focused companies in the market such asDing Yih Industrial Co which manufactures catv coaxial cable connectorsand RF coaxial cable connectors suitable for a wide range of cabletypes and sizes.Jack Chang, CEO at Favorlangh Communication Consulting Inc explainedthat his company, "Provides specialised market research on retainer oron a project by project basis,drafting franchise proposals andevaluating opportunities."Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

CBSProducts noted that most of the existing stringing winches did not havethe necessary tension control required by fibre cables. It designedtensioners to provide controlled braking via hydraulic variablecontrols, and secondary braking through the use of hydraulic discbrakes.In any stringing operation a cable pulling bond or rope is firstinstalled along with running out blocks.Fibre optic cable installation lengths are long to reduce splicingwhich is costly and increases signal loss, but this results in the needfor a fibre puller able to take 5 km of rope. The pullers and tensioneralso need to be versatile to cope with arduous environments.CBS supplies a range of solutions to meet these demands; trailermounted machines with high ground clearance for towing behind allterrain vehicles to light weight machines that can be manuallytransported in inaccessible site locations.Underground fibre cables are usually installed manually with pulling ofcable by hand, whereas copper communications cables are installed usingsmall diameter (150 mm) capstan winches that provide large tensioncapacities (4000 kg); these winches are then used to pull fibre cablesthat require tensions as low as 200 kg.To protect the cables from over tensioning, a simple fused swivel isemployed by CBS, rated for the maximum allowable cable load. If thefused swivel breaks mid pull, the ends of the swivel need to be locatedand retrieved. The two ends then need to be reconnected before the pullcan recommence. Also, the draw rope is usually left on the ground.CBS' new winch has integral hydraulic load monitoring pre-set for thelevel of pull at which the torque is relieved from the capstan'shydraulic motor to stop the pull. Tension remains in the cable due tothe number of wraps of draw rope around the capstan. The winch has aremovable rope-take drum. A large diameter (760 mm) capstan allowsgreater lengths of installation cable to be wrapped around, allowing asecond winch to assist the pulling winch.Mid-point pulls, or pulls that have severe changes in direction requirecable figure eighting to ensure the cable does not kink or snag. CBShas introduced its C-1050 cable fleeters with mid-assist winching,currently being used in the UK and Malaysia to overcome problemsassociated with figure eighting which usually takes up large areas ofpavement, roads, or motorway hard shoulder.At mid point there is no loose end, so the cable taken off the drum islooped through a hydraulic cable feeder which takes cable into adetachable drum at a rate of 100 m per minute, hence it can move 2 kmof cable in 20 minutes.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Helped byutility sector customers, the vast task was completed in April 1995.OS can now produce site centred Superplan plots, the OS's replacementfor traditional large scale maps. Each Superplan Plotting System isconnected via ISDN link to the OS's main database offering on-demandaccess to the latest mapping of any part of Great Britain.A new large scale digital map data product used throughout the cableand construction industries is OS's Land-Line, used by most localauthorities instead of conventional paper mapping. Land-Line data isnot just used as a screen image, but is increasingly manipulated andmerged with other datasets such as cable or service networks. Thenumber of plots now being produced for use as working documents orarchive copies means that the volume of mapping in use is increasingrather than decreasing.When Land-Line is used with suitable GIS software, linked to one ormore databases, the resulting spatial-data asset management system canbe an efficient way of dealing with large amounts of constantlychanging information.OS's Address point is another data product suitable for use by thecable industry, providing a geographical reference for each postaladdress in Great Britain. Frequently liked with Land-line, it isreported to be proving an effective way of geo-referencing a customerdatabase for purposes as varied as marketing and network growthplanning and fault identification.Accurate up-to-date data using quality datasets enables efficient andeconomic development of existing and potential customer databases.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

But manufacturers have notaddressed these issues because their customers have not raised them.Enclosure manufacturers pay lip service to heat dissipation but providelittle evidence for their claims. The operating temperatures of 40oC to+60oC sets low and high temperature operating extremes, and, short-termwarranties deal with the occasional 'infant mortality' of productsdeployed. But these provisions do not address the impact of temperatureon the long-term reliability of RF amplifiers. Neither specifications(nor warranty coverages) address failure rates over the life of theproduct, nor project a life expectancy for the products.Heat impact on operating performance and life of amplifiers needs to bemeasured and here users can turn to extensive testing by the USDepartment of Defense (DoD) on integrated circuit performance relativeto heat impacts. The US DoD document MIL-HDBK-217 (MIL-SPECS) providesa measure of heat impacts on component integrated circuit (IC) chipfailure rates.MIL-HDBK-217 states that the transistor failure rate doubles for every9oC (16.2oF) increase in die temperature. This applies at anytemperature and is not a range of threshold. Therefore, the cooler theoperating temperature maintained, the lower the failure rate over thelife of the component IC chips in the RF amplifier. Consequently,broadband outside plant designer should specify enclosures that bestquantifiably maintain the lowest operating temperatures for the RFamplifiers they house.Previous relevant tests include those by broadband system engineers inSacramento, California, 1988; enclosure and amplifier product testsconducted by Channell Commercial Corporation in Temecula, California,1990; and proprietary field tests of new high frequency amplifierproducts conducted by an amplifier manufacturer in Sunnyvale,California, 1993, employing metal and thermoplastic enclosures.The Sacramento tests were conducted by the local cable televisionsystem to help decide between Reliable's (now Reltec) traditional metalenclosures or Channell Commercial's thermoplastic enclosures. Superiorheat dissipation was the criterion.Test results at the extreme ambient temperature of 38.3oC (101oF)indicated the coolest reading on the IC chip as 60.6oC (141 oF). or4.4oC (40oF) over ambient using the Channell CPH1730/500. At the lowtemperature extreme of 11.1oC (52oF) ambient, Channell's had the bestshowing for IC chip temperature at 37.8oC (100oF), or 8.9oC (48oF) overambient. Reliable's had 24.4oC (76oF) over ambient, or 53.3oC (128oF).In both termperature extremes there was a consistent difference intemperature on the IC chip, between the results for the Reliable andChannell enclosures, an increment of about 15.5oC (28oF), with theChannell enclosure having the best results.Applying the MIL-HDBK-217 figures, that would mean deploying an RFamplifier in the Reliable TV-1832/A would increase the predictablefailure rate for the IC chips by nearly three and a half times over thesame amplifier mounted in Channell Commercial's CPH1730/500. And thisdifferential factor will likely hold true at any temperature within thespecified operating range.Testing by Channell Commercial in Temecula, California, in 1990 covered22 different production models of enclosures from four leadingmanufacturers and various amplifier models from three leadingmanufacturers to gather temperature data on amplifiers, but comparativedata on enclosure heat dissipation was also collected.The amplifiers tested were: Magnavox 450MHz and 550MHz trunkamplifiers, 450 MHz and 550MHz line extenders; Scientific Atlanta450MHz and 550MHz trunk amplifiers, 450 MHz and 550MHz line extenders;Jettold 450 MHz and 550 MHz trunk amplifiers, 450 line extenders.The enclosure models included in the tests were: Pyramid 1S30.;Moped;Reliable TV-104, TV-106, TV-1024, TV-1228, TV-1832 and ChannellCommercial CPH1230/STD, CPH1230/500, CHP1730/5TD, CPH1730/500. Data wasrecorded by sensors at four locations inside each enclosure's coversand amplifiers.Data was collected at thirty minute intervals, twenty-four hours perday over 30 days. The test data is proprietary but it showed thesuperiority of the Channell Commercial enclosure products in terms ofamplifier heat dissipation, especially the 1230 and 1730 units with theseries 500 heat dissipation covers.The results of the proprietary field tests of new high frequencyamplifier products by a major manufacturer in Sunnyvale, California, in1993, remain proprietary, however, the test data confirms the data fromthe two earlier tests.Channell thermoplastic enclosures achieve high performance throughtheir wall thicknesses, louvering, and type and quality of materialsused in their manufacture. And, special heat dissipating covers enhanceperformance in severe sun loading conditions. RF amplifiermanufacturers strive for higher frequencies and wider bandwidths,making the effect of heat dissipation and heat rise on electronics evermore critical. Amplifiers nominally generate 50 W of heat dissipation,but worse case parameters easily exceed 100 W.Field tests show that above 36.7oC (98oF), the heat dissipationcharacteristics of Channell Commercial enclosures diverge from thenorm. Other enclosures, especially metal units, track linearly withincreases in ambient temperature, while Channell's track morepositively toward a cooler scale of temperature on the IC Chip. Even ifall other design factors were equal, such as vents and louvers,attention to convection principles, heat sinking metal bracketry foramplifier mounting, the amount of free air surrounding the mountedamplifier etc, the difference between the materials used formanufacturing enclosures would still be significant. For heatdissipation, thermoplastic enclosures out-perform metal enclosures.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Ducting designed specifically for the catv andtelecommunications industries is supplied by Dura-line who's HDPE MainDuct System is a total duct solution comprising durable product withhigh impact resistance and tensile strength to simplify installation.It can be buried directly using conventional civils techniques, orploughed straight into the ground, even at sub-zero temperatureswithout duct shattering; it is also flexible enough to substantiallyreduce the need for angled bends.The company's Silicore Sub Duct comprises a virtually indestructibleHDPE outer with co-extruded permanent lubrication producing anextremely low coefficient of friction to ensure that even under highpulling loads, cable and ropes do not burn through the sub duct's wallsand it does not deteriorate or diminish with age. Coil set is totallyeliminated during coiling manufacture when the memory is set in apermanent straight line - so the sub duct does not coil or corkscrewwhen pulled from the drum.Last year the company opened a manufacturing facility in the UK tohandle the UK demand for main duct and sub-duct products. Advancedengineering features included in the product range are printing,striping and colour coding. Other products in the company's portfolioinclude customer feeds, speciality duct for fibre optic, undergroundchambers, slot boxes, cable pulling lubricants and a range of cablepulling and sub duct accessories.Dura-line has recently appointed Cliff Moss, formerly of IBM, as itsmanaging director.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

When did you begin door-to-door cable selling?Dave. I started in 1993. I was put on a training course, and, by theend, I was more or less convinced that the company knew what it wastalking about. But, after a few weeks of door knocking, I knew the realstory.MS. What was the training course like?Dave. The course ran over five days, We went through everything fromproduct knowledge to 'dealing with people'; that is, what to say. Youwere told to do this and that, but when you actually faced thesesituations things turned out different.MS. What were you told to say to prospective customers?Dave. We were told that it was going to be a soft sell, hand deliveringglossy literature and then knocking on the door. In some areas, eventhe literature drops had not been done. First I had to 're-market' toareas where most people had already declined the service, so it wasdifficult to sell there. In the end, I was mainly selling the phone.MS. Was the telephone service widely available then?Dave. No, not in all areas. It was very annoying when you were given agood sales lead... a prospective customer who had phoned or writtenrequesting information. The fact that the service was not availablemeant that the call was a waste of my selling time.MS. You were a 'Cable Advisor,' how did you sell?Dave. Yes. The term 'salesman' was not used. In fact, we were sent toclose the deal. I was told that I should spend no more than 20 minutestops on any sales visit before closing. If I was selling the telephoneservice, I would knock at the door and come out with somethingguaranteed to get attention. "Hello! Do you know the advantages ofbeing on cable telephone? You only pay for the exact amount of time thecall takes... so you can really save money. Would you like me to gothrough your phone bill for you, to show you were you could be savingmoney?" which worked better than saying, "I've come to talk about thebenefits of cable." I was never told how it would save money, I justread the literature.MS. Who did you approach?Dave. Generally it was the male owner of the house. On one or twooccasions, I thought that I had closed, only to find I had lost itbecause the woman had not been involved.MS. So its a family decision?Dave. Yes. The children were also influential, very keen on cabletelevision because it's new and they can get lots of channels. They canbrag at school "Did you see so and so on cable last night?"; especiallyto the kids in their class who don't yet have it.MS. When were the best times to call?Dave. We usually called between 6 and 8 o'clock pm. It was difficult toget both husband and wife together at that time as wives were usuallybusy with the domestic routine around dinner. This wasn't recognised bythe compay. They assumed that everybody was at home at this time;therefore, that was the best time to sell.MS. Were you encouraged to work outside the set hours?Dave. Yes. I was working seven days a week. I didn't like working onSunday so I would use this day for pre-arranged appointments only, butplenty of cable advisors were working longer hours, and signing upexactly the same number of customers.MS. What was the problem?Dave. What you've got to accept is, there is no point in calling onpeople who genuinely don't want the service. We were just given areas.You knew almost straight away whether you had got a good area for salesor a bad, dried-up one. There were certain areas that you knew you weregoing to sell very well. A new run in a better quality council estatewas bound to provide a good crop of cable connections, These customerswanted exactly what cable could offer immediately. Lots of sport, morechannels. films so that they didn't have to rent videos from the shops.Better off areas simply didn't want catv - they had plenty of otherthings to do and were only interested in cheaper telephone services.MS. Who was interested?Dave. People who had asked the company for information were generallyprofessional types wanting to slash large telephone bills. But thetelephone service wasn't always available which prevented me closingthe deal. One time I had sold the whole of a block, but nobody could beconnected because the people who put in the ducts had installed thewrong type. I got fed-up making excuses for the company.MS. What was the biggest fault in the marketing plan?Dave. They did not listen to the actual customers, and tailor cableservices to their needs. Advertising is essential. I would open afreephone number for anyone wanting to know more about cable. I wouldadvertise in local newspapers and on the local TV.MS. What is the average 'life expectancy' of a salesman and how arethey paid?Dave. Selling life is short. They burn you out. Normally you lastbetween three and six months. There was a small basic pay, thencommission. In theory, you could earn a lot of money. But salesmen fellout with their supervisors and were out of a job. I have yet to receivecommission owed.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Its Wizard system includes a complete cable andsatellite TV Infomanagement system for RdB and Oracle databases, andadditional databases in the new year.Svenka Kezurer of Wiztec adds, "We have also looked at industry videoservers and developed APIs to support a variety of different serversand any new entrants."The company already provides Video on Demand billing facilities and iscurrently running a pilot billing and customer service scheme for aninteractive games channel. It also plans to be involved in interactiveservices. Kezurer explained, "We provide the interface at the entrypoint where a customer who wants to use an interactive service firstneeds to get authorisation fro the Wiztec database. Afterwards thesystems again interface with the Wiztec system which will provide allthe information on what exactly was provided, how much data was used ordownloaded, and for how long - which would allow charging for Internetusage on duration used or data transferred. We can set up all kinds ofsoftware to charge according to different services offered and theirdifferent rates."Kezurer added, "We recognise that telephony is a must in the UK today,and will provide this capability by the end of next year, aiming atcable companies providing telephony as a new service."The company says its flexible approach to tailoring pricing proposalsand payment terms is more adaptable to the diverse norms of theinternational market.Flexibility and openness of the product itself allows the core systemto adapt to growing demands, simplifying maintenance. A $2 millionorder for Wizard SMS system software and services for Singapore CableVision (SCV), delivered and running by May 1st after a mid-Februaryauthorisation, is cited as exemplifying Wiztec's flexibility andability to stand by a commitment. Randall Coieman, president of SCVsaid that the $500 million 30 TV channel and interactive multimediaservices operation chose Wizard for its rich functionality, high levelof support and flexibility of tailoring to requirements.A Wizard system installed at Telkabel in Austria will enable thecompany to offer its 420,000 subscriber base enhanced Pay TV options aswell as PPV and VOD.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Real-time data is also used tostreamline company management systems. Tenfore's financial informationservice is often integrated with existing software packages. Access toreal-time data such as news stories, foreign exchange rates and stockmarket prices allows a quick response to market changes and isgradually replacing traditional information intermediaries. By settingspecific filters on international news feeds, users are informed ofsignificant market influencing stories as they break, with time todigest and act upon them rather than still trawling through the presscuttings.Short and medium term cash management can be enhanced by using real-time financial data on deposit, interbank and forward rates. TheTenfore system also helps with hedging foreign exchange risk. Forex andforward prices can be viewed on the PC screen, in a chart or in a'live' spreadsheet. Tenfore's software allows real-time tracking ofmarket movements. Global prices can be displayed and real-time tickergraphs track 'bid', 'ask', 'last trade' or 'volume' according torequirements.Users can view real-time and historic data on shares, forex or indicesto present in graphs, spreadsheets or company reports, updatedable inreal-time.Tenfore subscribers get free use of software for analysing data;compatibility with other software programmes enables ease ofintegration. Live data can be pasted into other Windows compatibleprogrammes like Exel and Word, updated in real-time.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCABLE BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetDecember 1, 1995OPEN SYSTEMS - UP TO A POINTInformation exchange between catv and telco systems, not integration,is needed says Barco whose Rosa system intefaces with telecom mangementsystemsMinimising downtime and network redundancy are two of the mostimportant considerations in tele-communications, whereas catv has beendriven by the number of channels, not their quality or availability.'How else could a customer get all of these programs ?'But DTH satellites now offer an alternative, while digital DTH and newhigh pay interactive services will demand optimum network reliability.So cable companies must provide an attractive package of programs, plusservices not available via satellite, of excellent quality, andavailability comparable to telephony. Operators have to dramaticallyimprove their network reliability and quality.Pre-convergence, Barco developed a catv management concept,establishing standards for communication between equipment, developinga propriety protocol supporting communication via normal PSTN lines.Full Service Networks are now demanded with integration of catv intoTelecom Network Management systems a priority.The Telecom industry has long been highly regulated with widespreadstandard protocols and interfaces for communication between differentsystems. Hence adapttation of management concepts with open standardinterfaces to higher level management systems is needed with fullclient server architectures, ideally able to interface with non-proprietary products.But it does not seem relevant, or economical, to completely integratetelco and catv systems. More appropriate and feasible is sufficientintegration for information and tasks to be exchanged from one systemto the other. A first step is in-depth monitoring of the headend andnetwork. This provides the operator with the information required torespond quickly and efficiently to problems before they are noticed bythe subscriber.Secondly, backup and rerouting systems need to be established toincrease the network's overall Mean Time Between Failures. Finally,links to existing Network Management systems and Subscriber Managementsystems need to be established to provide accurate managementinformation and information to customer support for proactive responceto incoming calls.Analysing how many people telcos need per 1000 subscribers to obtainthe service they are providing and comparing that with catv, telcofigures turn out to be higher by a factor of 10. Hence catv operatorswho want to offer similar services will have to build a similar serviceorganisation using an efficient tool to manage this workforce andminimising operational costs.Barco's ROSA (RCDS Open Systems Architecture) system is designed tofulfil this function. Starting with its FSM860 Headend Supervisor,Barco has supplied monitoring and management tools for catv headendsand networks. All existing RF products have been equipped withmonitoring and remote control interfaces and all new units have aserial control bus (Remote Control and Diagnostic System bus - RCDS)allowing full remote control and automatic configuration.The RCDS protocol was especially developed to configure and managehardware equipment in a catv environment making them easier and lessexpensive to integrate into a management system. ROSA provides self-healing capabilities, system performance testing and statisticalinformation to optimise operations and maintenance workforce.A user-friendly GUI allows the user to define his own windows and viewson the information present in the system. The open architecture of thedatabase allows access by other systems via ODBC .The ROSA system can be used as a powerful stand-alone management tool,and as an intelligent element manager able to interface with overallTelecom Network Management systems at different levels. ROSA alsoprovides the redundancy level needed for the headend to be competitivewith availability figures reached by Telecom switches. ROSA handlesmultiple headends, distribution nodes and catv networks. Forcommunication between the sites and a Central Management Centre ROSAsupports X25, X31, ISDN, PSTN and other connections. Its modularapproach allows gradual integration into the CATV system.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Oracle is helping create information warehouses thatcan manage, store and organise all the multimedia data for theseservices, and its media servers support millions of clients and a hostof consumer devices.Telecommunications-related activity now accounts for 23 per cent ofOracle's US $3 billion world-wide turnover and its dedicated team ofmore than 130 telecoms consultants now service every major cableoperator in the UK. Oracle recently supplied a suite of financialapplications including stock control, purchasing and foreign currencymanagement to Telewest Group, UK. For Bell Cable Media, Oracle isputting in a financial suite to manage its UK franchises and an inter-admin accounting system to manage wholesale retail telecommunicationstraffic by different interconnect partners.Birmingham Cable's new subscriber management and billing system isbased on Oracle technology. And Nynex, whose key supplier for billingsystems is IBM, made substantial purchases of Oracle technology lastyear to deploy across all its UK franchises.Oracle provided staff to see what the cable operators wanted, thendeveloped a technology approach responsive to the individual andrapidly changing needs and goals of its potential client base.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Background pollingis constant with logging of performance history time and date stampedfor analysis of recurring problem areas, forecasting of servicerequirements and planning preventative maintenance.Four screen levels lead the user through problem identification; firstscreen - complete system overview; second - zoom in on selectednetwork; third - digital or alarm level view of the chosen equipment;fourth - the analogue or parameter level indicators of the selectedhardware. After problem identification and location the operator canrestore the system. Components in an NMS 5000 system are: software,computer, transponder, and serial port interface. Advantages includereal-tie system management, control and monitoring at the headend orhub, instant access to system status; performance logging; malfunctionpinpointing; layered software; secure remote monitoring andtroubleshooting and ability to drive alarms and third party interfaces.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCABLE BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetDecember 1, 1995RISK MANAGEMENT PAYS DIVIDENDSCustomer analysis and profiling reduces bad debt and can alsofacilitate packaged marketing, fostering customer loyaltyIt is critical for cable operators to get a fast return on investment,hence whatever the technology, territory or sales environment, the keybusiness areas of marketing and risk management play a key role inachieving this objective.The pressure to recruit new subscribers should be balanced with arealistic view of risk management. Return on investment andprofitability also relys on customers using the service and payingtheir bills.In areas where the licence requirement is to offer the service to allin franchised areas, door-to-door is a logical means of achievingblanket coverage. Moreover, it is a tried and tested tactic in the USand represents proven experience which MSO's apply in new territories,with telemarketing and direct mail as a support tactic. It is a keyrequirement to target activity appropriately. Both catv and telephonymay be viewed by operators as mass services within concentratedgeographical areas, the method of marketing varies according todifferent user groups as families young people and senior citizens viewthe same services very differently.Different targetting tools are used to achieve different objectives.Area Analysis - understanding the territories in which operators work -is critical for both engineering and sales/marketing activity. Theseareas include franchises, nodes and sales territories, all of whichdrive build and sales initiatives. Cable operators use geo-demographicdata alongside post office and local authority data. Many UK operatorsuse CCN's Mosaic to classify individual postcodes as neighbourhoodtypes. The analysis entails reporting and mapping; mapping can beundertaken within the Mosaic software and, for more detaileddefinition, within operators' own geographic information systems (GIS).Customer analysis and communication: understanding the profile ofcustomers is vitally important to operators if they are to provide thebest service and to foster loyalty. The analysis of customer behaviour(ie service take-up, payment history, attitude to service etc) isundertaken using operators' own data as well as external data such asMosaic. Resulting analysis is used to target direct response (mail orphone), direct sales activity and to provide management information.CCN has designed an appropriate PC database package specifically foruse by cable companies.After identifying customer types most appropriate for cable services,sales and marketing activity is initiated. Risks attached to taking onnew business include - will the applicant pay? Is the applicant whothey say they are? As cable develops there is increased risk ofconsumers swapping suppliers and of fraudulent activity. With swapping,there is the temptation to run up a bill with one supplier beforedefaulting and moving to another (eg BT to cable). There is also agrowing threat from serious fraudsters using features such as three-waycalling to divert calls internationally in call selling operationswhich never pay service bills.Operators check creditworthiness using their own proof of identityprocedures as well as credit referencing techniques supplied byagencies such as CNN.Isuses and solutions involved include: application risk assessmentwhere potential customers wishing to apply for service are creditchecked using Credit Referencing Agency (CRA) data. Scorecards used toassess applications range from generic designs such as CCN's Delphithrough to bespoke cards designed to incoprorate the operators ownpoliices.Application processing entails capturing the details of an applicant,applying the scorecard and delivering the result for installationaction to create an efficient customer service. Systems such as CCN'sautoscore incorporate the individual requirements of each client.Previous fraudulent activity is one of the best warning signs foravoiding or intercepting the risk of fraud. CCN's Detect comparesexisting and previous credit applications to identify inconsistencieswhich may signal a potential fraud. The credit industry fraud avoidancescheme (CIFAS) is another initiative which enables its members to shareinformation that is useful in identifying potential frauds, whichoperators access through their CRA.Once a history of customer behaviour has been built, further riskscoring can be based on real experience. 'Behavioural scoring' allowsoperators to identify customers for PPC or value added services.CCN's international network operates marketing systems, CRA bureaufacilities and scoring services according to the data available in eachterritory.This flexibility enables key business issues to be addressed regardlessof the environment.Operators have an opportunity to gain competitive advantage by makingfull use of the technology and software available to the cable industryto manage their marketing, risk and ultimately, profitability tomaximum effect.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

The perception is that while inflation may be in check,the new low yield on the 30-year long bond indicates that the economymay be sputtering.  Market sages predict that small cap andinternational equities are places to investigate.  As long as grumpyold men--starring Veto Bill Clinton and featuring a cast of stubborncongresspersons--hold the nation hostage with political self interestand a bad case of moral indignation, the refreshing thought ofconservative fiscal restraint could well give way to a very nervousstock market.

Last week (just in time for something to write about!), myfriends in Texas, Bill Arnold and Nancy McMurray of the great TexasCable TV Association (mark your calendars for February 21-23 to makecertain you are in San Antonio with us!), sent me something thatpurports to be a draft copy by Lou Holtz, Jr. for script of The Cable Guy.     Now, I cannot attest to the verity of the package that arrivedfrom Austin, but I can attest that I'm certain the NationalAssociation of Broadcasters paid to have it written!     (It is, by the way, kind of funny in a sick way.)     In fact, one of the more poignant (for those of us in the cableindustry) scenes involved The Cable Guy telling his "mark" all abouthow he--because he can turn state's evidence and testify against thepoor schmuck who got cable for "free"--can get away with stealingwhile the general, unwashed public cannot.     "Me ... I'm just the cable guy.  How many of us are there in theentire country?  Five thousand?  Ten thousand?  I'm one bad apple in asmall group.      "But you ... You're Joe Citizen.  You're one of five hundredmillion people who'd love to get cable for free ... This is amulti-billion dollar industry and still growing.  They've got to makean example of someone..."     And, just in case you might think any news or publicity is "goodnews," check out this description of the Friendly Cable office:     "The Friendly Cable building is exactl what you would expect itto be.  The office building was probably built in the 'cable rush' ofthe early eighties.  It lloks like one of those new three-storybuildings that was built cheply.  There is a CLOSE-UP of the companylogo on the door.  The logo is a bigtelevision set whose picture tube has eyes, a nose, and an ear-to-eargrin   ... "     The script, of course, revolves around everyone's greed atgetting something for nothing ... in this case, free cable premiumchannels.     Oh, if only people did want premium channels so badly!  (Justkidding.) Carrey is perfect for the insidious, insinuating anddownright dangerous cable guy ... can't wait to see the movie.  Thinkthe studio will do a special preview for us?  Maybe at the NCTA?     This movie is no favor to the cable industry ... but that's justtough luck unless the industry can unite to make amnesty  (temporary,naturally) a major tie-in with the release date.  Just thinking outloud ... any takers?  Any other ideas?  Want a bootleg copy of thescript?     Random Notes:     *1996?  4 more years?  In Clinton's case, it sounds like a curse.

(1551 words) CopyrightTHE COLE PAPERS via NewsNetJanuary 1996TV NATIONOn-line program listings have potential for publishers and viewersFor the true television aficionado, the weekly listings printed in a bookdistributed over the weekend are not enough.Canceled shows, vague sports listings ("If the playoffs go to seven games,then none of these programs will air.")  and the whims of station managers arenot accurately reflected.The listings in the daily paper are marginally better, but they're usuallystill 48 to 72 hours out of date.For those with cable, there is usually a "preview" channel that has a window inwhich specific programs are advertised, along with a "crawling" listing. Theproblem is that for a 50-channel service, the "crawl" is literally that, takingthree to four minutes to get through all 50 channels.No, the true TV aficionado wants his or her listings on computer -- in theory.That theory has been adopted by the two major providers of TV listings. BothTribune Media Services and TV Data Technologies have built systems that allowreaders to access listings on-line, either through bulletin board systems(BBSes) or the World-Wide Web.Our resident TV aficionado, Pete Wetmore, who edits an award-winning TV book inreal life, takes a look at the two products (Tribune's is in operation in acouple of places; TV Data plans to unveil its offering next month).Wetmore comes away impressed with the technology, but a bit puzzled as to whypeople would spend lots of time in front of their computers just to plot theirexistence in front of the TV.Nonetheless, this new technology does give one a chance to pause: With a goodon-line TV listings service and a mailroom that can handle "tailored"newspapers, a publisher could stop sending the weekly TV book -- or even thedaily TV listings page -- to subscribers who partake of the on-line version.That's quite a lot of newsprint.Another example of how new technology can save newsprint comes from the DaytonDaily News in Ohio. As the "local" paper for the Proximity Peace Talks -- heldto discuss the future of the former Yugoslavia at nearby Wright-Patterson AirForce Base -- the paper was able to score a scoop: It acquired a complete copyof the peace accords just after they were initialed.Inside, we reprint a column Dayton Daily News Editor Max Jennings wrote for thepaper because it explains that in a newsprint-only world, he would not havebeen able to adequately leverage the scoop. But with a World-Wide Web site, theDayton paper was able to reproduce the entire accords -- and make themavailable to people around the world.Jennings' point is that this new medium not only gives him the opportunity todo new things, it also gives him the opportunity to give readers what newsprintwould have never allowed him to provide.Our next stop is also new media-oriented: Rick Smolen, a photojournalist with along history at National Geographic as well as the Day in the Life coffee-tablebooks, pushes the envelope he pretty much personally created in photojournalismCD-ROMs, with Alice to Ocean and Passage to Vietnam, with a new project: 24Hours in Cyberspace.Kurt Foss, electronic photojournalism expert (he's a big part of the digitalefforts of the National Press Photographers Association), talks to Smolen andhis merry band of picture takers about how they plan to move beyond CD-ROMs andinto the World-Wide Web for this new venture (Foss is a participant as well).A shifting of thought patterns is also the basis for a piece by Cole GroupConsultant Mike Middlesworth, who talks about what a publisher should look forwhen attempting to move into new technology -- and, specifically, what apublisher should seek when retaining a consultant.And, lastly, in the Hellbox we have news from P.INK and ISGI -- the twoGerman-based front-end suppliers have encountered rough patches recently, andwe take a look at what's going on.Yes, so far we are a TV nation (though the Michael Moore show by that name wasrecently canceled by its second network; your printed listings might reflectit), but it seems like in a very short time we might become a PC nation.-- David M. ColeBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE COLE PAPERS via NewsNetJanuary 1996ON-LINE TV LISTING SERVICES NOW AVAILABLE FOR BBSES AND WEBDigitized TV listings are a thing of the present.    The two major suppliers oftelevision program listings -- Tribune Media Services of Chicago and TV DataTechnologies of Queensbury, N.Y. -- introduced electronic listings last June atNEXPO '95 in Atlanta.Since then, Tribune has moved into the newspaper marketplace and TV Data hastaken its entry back to the drawing board.In theory, digitized listings provide an easy way to find out what's on TV inthe 500-channel world the cable industry says is lurking just around the corner-- an impossible task in the print realm, unless a publisher wants to make hisor her TV book a loss leader with capital "L"s.By providing a PC-equipped television viewer with access to a database and aslick GUI, the suppliers reasoned, newspapers could open a new revenue stream-- through subscriptions and on-screen advertising -- and spend less timekeeping up with changes on the local cable systems.And maybe one day, it was suggested, newspaper subscribers who took digitizedlistings could be stricken from the print distribution list, saving thenewspaper old money while making new.Both Tribune and TV Data have products now, and in the works, that deliverlistings (and ads) via either a BBS or a home page on the World-Wide Web.Tribune has TV Week Interactive running on two web sites and a third is rampingup to go on-line this month. TV Data plans to roll out its Internet version ofTV Data Online at the Interactive Newspapers conference Feb. 21-24 in SanFrancisco.Each iteration offers grids 10 or so channels deep, program details, searchengines for tracking down that elusive movie from the 1940s you're dying totape, customizable listing displays and the fun of playing with the futurenow.But having seen both suppliers' efforts in some form, this TV book editor hasto pose a $64,000 question: Who's going to use it?Many viewers soon may have four ways to find out what's on TV:*Their friendly, reliable, home-delivered weekly TV book. Compact, portable andrecyclable, the printed guide's contents are accessed with a flick of a thumband finger.Occasionally, it arrives damp (or not at all), but it's cheap (as little as 35cents, if the book is distributed any day but Sunday), it doesn't have to bedownloaded or dialed into (no phone charges), and it doesn't require a tributeto Bill Gates to own one.*On-screen guides. Many cable systems have set aside one channel to displaycontinuous, rolling listings. As cable has advanced, these displays have becomeinteractive, provided the subscriber has a box and a remote from the cablecompany. Thus, a click on-screen changes channels to the desired program.*The off-line PC application (no Macs need apply). Dial up the localfranchise's modem, set your software to receive and in a matter of minutes, aweek's worth of listings (two, if the franchise is Tribune's) are on your harddrive.Click on the application and, if you've done this before and have set up yourown customized view of TV land, you have tailored listings for on-screen reviewor output to a printer.*The on-line web source. Dial up the WWW, go to your local source (for thatmatter, go to a distant site) and start asking for shows you want to see, orclick a button to see the grid for what's on right now, or scan the featurestext for best bets, or -- Hey! Don't get too involved -- you're taking timeaway from watching TV!And that may be the telling issue with digitized listings: No matter how easythey are to access, will viewers want to take the time to go to one videoscreen to see what's on another? Or, even worse for broadcasters, will theybecome so enchanted with surfing the listings that they forget why they wentthere in the first place?Perhaps there won't be a fair test until the 500-channel age dawns. For now,we'll quit questioning the value of these packages and take a look at what theydo.To get a sense of how non-print listings work, we screen tested the off-lineapplication TV Data Online (which is to be joined by a 'Net version shortly)and visited three sites using Tribune's TV Week Interactive.TV Data provided a phone number and password in order to download a demo of TVData Online. The Windows-based program (there are no plans for a Mac versionfrom either TV Data or Tribune) was a hefty 2.2 megabytes big, which took awhile to bring in at 9600 bps.Listings downloads are much smaller, 250 kilobytes and up, depending on thenumber of channels and cable systems in the subscriber's area.When the app was kicked into gear, it first announced that new data wereavailable, and given permission, it brought in new material for movies,features and grids a day at a time. Updating each day, on a Compaq '486 withoutany special goodies, took about 30 seconds.With TVDO, the user can set depths and widths for grid entries. Keep clickingon a down arrow and soon five lines of text are displayed for each channel --and "ABC" in a half-hour box becomes ABC World News This Morning. Similarly,the width per box can be expanded and "ABC" again grows to its full title.To see details about a program, just click on its box and a text window opens,showing a synopsis of the show, who stars in it and other air times. (This lastbit of info is certainly a step ahead of the printed guide, aside from movielogs.)By going into a channel lineup dialog box, Mr. or Ms. Viewer can create auser-specific lineup. Channels can be chosen from the master list for the cablesystem being referenced, then sorted by channel, call letters or random (to addan element of surprise, we presume).When the setup is done, the user tells the app to store the new order, and adata sort is performed -- taking another few seconds.TVDO's grid is white with colored lettering, giving a visual cue as to thenature of the program's content. Some time segments get pretty bright andcheery, and perhaps too dazzling to be meaningful. But the visually intuitivemay find the idea practical.One welcome feature in TVDO is keyboard commands. Menu choices can be keyboarddriven; at the right side of the screen are buttons with the same choices forthe mouse-and-click crowd. Among the buttons are days of the week, for quickaccess to daily grids.Two other screens give access to program details. One, Best Bets, opens ascreen with four buttons -- Best Bets, Soap Talk, TV Q/A and TV Trivia. A clickon Best Bets brings up text, with paragraphs alternating black and blue. Thetext is identical to features copy provided to print clients of TV DataTechnologies.Fortunately, we had a good look at TVDO before calamity struck -- theapplication bombed. On restart, it asked whether to process new data again. Wedeclined, not wishing to spend the time, and found that our channel lineuppreferences had been saved.When TVDO bombed a second time, it came back devoid of grid info, just agarden-variety spreadsheet grid (from BaseCode) -- and no evident way through amenu to tell it to go find the data it had refreshed before.Upon reflection, we concluded that the curse we cast on suppliers at NEXPObooths, where we're renowned for causing demos to explode, had visited yetanother supplier. Sorry about that.(To get a static gander at TVDO, you can surf over to TV Data's web site,http://www.tvdata.com/.)Tribune's truly on-line product can be seen at three web sites -- Tribune'sdemo home page (http://www.tmstv.com), Continental Cablevision of New England(http://www.continental.com/) and Arizona Central (http://www.azcentral.com/),the recently started web service of Phoenix Newspapers that also has a presenceon America Online.On a first visit, the viewer is asked to designate which state and city inwhich he or she lives. A multi-digit code is assigned to the user for futureuse, or more simply, the viewer can bookmark a page past the initial sign-up toprovide rapid access the next time around.A tour of these three sites shows the advantage to having 'Net access: nolengthy download (we were running on a Mac Quadra 650 through a 28.8 kbps modemto a local Internet provider), no strange interface (we are partial to Macs, weadmit) and fairly good response time.Totally mouse-driven, Tribune's interface varies from site to site except forits grids, which are color-coded click-maps.On Arizona Central, movie titles appear in green, sports in yellow,news/talk/special affairs in magenta, gray for everything else. Continentaluses a wider range: red movies, green children, blue drama (although talkappears to be the same color), magenta comedy, green-on-gray news, a darkergreen for documentaries and cyan for sports.It makes for quite a display -- probably useful for some programming executivesplotting their next season, but near overkill for the common Joe, who has toread the program block title to know just what's what anyway.While Continental goes with grids and program searches right off, ArizonaCentral features a color pic of the week's cover story, with a link to thetext. As with TVDO, the content is drawn from the print-oriented product. (Onedrawback: The picture remains even after the program has aired.)The Tribune search screen is simple but comprehensive, with fields for programand/or episode title, and description. Click on the category field and a pop-upmenu provides so many choices, they stop at the letter "H."The search can be narrowed by date, including those gone by, to the last day inthe data cycle (from Saturday through the second Friday hence). One of fourtime blocks can be selected to further narrow the search.Once done, the search returns a list of programs, with name, date, time,channel number and service, program category and a few words about its content(movies get stars). After one search on Arizona Central, we printed out 12pages -- 45 items -- of "educational" programs airing for a one-week period.And there you have it -- literally. Go take a look at the Tribune sites, anddrop by TV Data in a few weeks to see its 'Net offering when it becomesavailable.How does all this play in Peoria? Dunno, but several score miles west, a fewfolks in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, have found it to their liking.One of the first Tribune customers to go live was the company that publishesthe Cedar Rapids Gazette, which put the bulletin board version up forsubscribers early in the fall on FYIowa, a collection of electronic servicesrun by Interactive Media."Interactive Media basically is coordinating the efforts of all of the Gazettecompanies," said Administrator Jim Debth. "When you go to FYIowa, FYIowa is theumbrella for the Gazette, Iowa Farmer Today and Kcrg-TV."FYIowa is overseen by Interactive Media, with two full-time people and ahalf-time graphics person. One full-time person from the Gazette works on it aswell, Debth said, while one person at Iowa Farmer Today spends part of his timeat it, as do two people at Kcrg.FYIowa also has a home page (http://www.infi.net/fyiowa/) through Internetprovider InfiNet of Norfolk, Va. In January, it will offer TV Vision, namedafter the Gazette's weekly TV book. Now, subscribers to FYIowa's BBS candownload TV Vision for off-line use.It's one of the first -- perhaps only -- instance where TV listings havegenerated a revenue trickle. About one BBS user in 10 downloads the listings,Debth said. Rates are $5.95 a month for 10 hours, $7.95 for 20 hours and $10.95for 30 hours. Subscribers to the Gazette get $1 off."We actually have some reasonable response," Debth said about subscribers' useof the BBS listings. "It'll be much more easy to get on our web site becauseyou won't have to download files."While FYIowa will use the print name TV Vision, on-line "it'll be a much more'Net-looking graphic," Debth said. Working with Tribune to prepare a webversion has been a snap, he said."Fortunately, we haven't had to do any of it ourselves, other than the graphicwe've provided them," Debth said. "We just kind of tell them this is how we'dlike the page to look."That's the idea, according to Barbara Needleman, a marketing executive atTribune Media Services."We put up a site for them and design some wallpaper for it," said Needleman,then wait for the client to ask for modifications. "If you put something on it,they know what they want to change."While Interactive Media may gain a smidgen of income from TV Vision off-line,most publishers continue to feed the 'Net while not taking money back from thecontent bottom-feeders."I don't think anyone is pricing it," Needleman said -- except, of course,Tribune. While declining to provide a dollar figure for its fees, Needlemanindicated that TV Week Interactive was priced attractively, especially sincefour tiers of service were available."There's different functionality in each of the tiers," she said, so costs andbenefits can be correlated well. "We've made it so that it's affordable forpapers who want to put something out but don't want to spend a lot of moneynow, all the way to papers who want to do very cable-specific products."At TV Data, pricing is not the immediate concern -- getting the product readyfor prime time is. Going back to the digital workbench was a marketing anddesign decision, according to Mike Laddin, vice president for marketing andproduct development."Frankly," Laddin said, "we felt there was some additional work we needed to doon the product. We took some more time to make sure we did it right."So he turned to Kevin Joyce, who had to look at his business card to find hislatest title: interactive and on-line services product manager. ("Maybe itshould be 'whatever is hot' product manager," he joked.)Describing the NEXPO iteration of TV Data Online as "a very young product,"Joyce said TV Data wanted to improve search times and screens."We cleaned up the user interface to the point that we threw out some thingsthat were confusing -- too many buttons, too many layers, too many menu items,"he said of the CodeBasic-driven product. The result: "We reduced the amount ofsteps for an action to take place, and made it easy to navigate."Joyce said that last summer, TV Data also realized it had to contend withseveral ways of delivering the data, not just through a BBS. "The Web, I think,caught everybody by surprise," Joyce said. "It proves people are thirsty forinformation and visual information."As Prodigy was the first to show an interest in digital listings from TV Data,it was natural to prepare for distribution through an on-line service -- butalso a proprietary bulletin board service, in this case Worldgroup fromGalacticomm of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for localized dial-up delivery, andeventually on the Internet."There are a lot of flavors and ways that newspapers are setting up theiron-line services," Joyce said. "We didn't want to be tied directly orintimately to any one style."Hence, TV Data had to back up a bit from its ties to Galacticomm to make surethat preparing for distribution via that route did not shut off other avenues,such as a BBS already running at a newspaper that simply wanted to add TVDO toits menu."We needed this product to work on a variety of delivery platforms," Joycesaid, although it is "totally a Windows-based product" in terms of theend-user, unless you're running Win95. Cranking up for Win95 is undecided, as"we're going to look and see what kind of a lifespan these off-lineapplications have in general."Is Laddin worried that Tribune has the jump on TV Data? Not hardly."In terms of the market overall and where we stand," Laddin said, "it's a newmedia and it's an emerging marketplace for everyone -- Tribune, ourselves, thenewspapers.""Everybody is very interested," he said. "There's a lot of activity, but thepapers are moving at a very deliberate way because everybody in the market isstill trying to figure out how they're going to make money. Short term,nobody's making any money at this, at least up to now."Compared to Tribune Media Services, TV Data has an enormous client base: morethan 2500 print clients, and a burgeoning role in providing data to on-screenproviders, such as cable companies and a new enterprise called VideoGuide Inc.(http://www.vgi.com).With backing from the Japanese trading firm Marubeni and consumer electronicsgiant Sanyo, VideoGuide has set up a delivery system that uses the radiofrequencies of wireless pagers and presents listings on-screen (freshlydownloaded overnight). The viewer can click -- using VideoGuide's remote -- toview or tape a program.The product is being marketed through Tandy Radio Shack stores and other majorretailers in selected areas.And so, as they say in TV land, stay tuned. How and when -- not whether --digital listings end up in your home is the question.More importantly, whether your newspaper will make any money off them is aneven more open question than it was last summer, when TV Week Interactive andTV Data Online were rolled out.The challenge lies ahead for publishers, while the suppliers have their part ofit well under way.

Thomson and Riley set outto get their own copy, which they did. (How, dear reader, is a professionalsecret.)Closer inspection revealed that the document was, in fact, the complete156-page version of the peace agreement.The highly technical, precise language spelling out the details of the landdivision was not grist for the local Ohio paper, but it certainly would befascinating stuff to the residents of the former Yugoslavia and theirneighbors, as well as to academics and other experts from around the world."What if," Riley asked Thomson, "we went back right now and scanned this intoour web site? Hey, we could scoop the world."They headed back at flank speed to the office while alerting Newsroom SystemsManager Jeff Adams that he had work to do. By 2 a.m., most of the pages hadbeen scanned in to the newspaper's Access Dayton web site on the Internet(http://www.access-dayton.com).Our web site had been the primary creation of another newsroom computerenthusiast, Joe Cunningham. He set it up soon after the announcement that thehistoric peace talks would be at Wright-Pat. Every bit of reporting we did onthe subject went onto the site, along with our photos, cartoons and the contentof a special 12-page section we produced on the opening day.As was appropriate, our coverage was more comprehensive and detailed thananyone else's we saw, and even before the latest caper with the finalagreement, the web site had become known to thousands, if not tens ofthousands, of people all over the world.The technology allows easy tracking of how many hits a site gets, and fromwhere; in the first few hours, 525 people requested information from ourBosnian web site.We were astonished at what we had wrought. We had our data accessed anddownloaded from all over Eastern Europe, Russia, Canada, a dozen countries inLatin America, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Sweden, Singapore,Australia -- every point of the globe.We also found our reporting subjected to international review and criticism.Vladimir Vuksan from Sarajevo sent a scathing e-mail to us that began: "I wasthoroughly disgusted to read the article (from the Dayton Daily News) in regardto the rescue of an American airman by Serbian Chetniks. In those two pieces,Serbian Chetniks are glorified as if they were the freedom fighters fighting onthe side of the Allies."Nothing could be more false. Serbian Chetniks were on the side of the Axisthrough the most of the World War II and have done horrendous crimes againstCroatian and Muslim populations."The next day, I received a personal e-mail from another unexpected source. Itbegan, "I read your column in Sunday's paper on all of the troubles you havehad telling foreign media representatives that Dayton is a place with qualitiesnot to be missed and to be taken into account."As one of those most deeply involved in all of these negotiation issues duringthe past months, I can confess to having been somewhat surprised and evenskeptical when Wright-Pat and Dayton emerged as one of the alternatives."But that is now past us. After close to a week here, I can assure you that weall feel that the choice of location was a good one. ... I can assure you thatwe have all found Dayton much more to our liking than I believe any one of usexpected would be the case. And we appreciate seeing the world through theprism of the Dayton Daily News!"It was signed by Carl Bildt, who identified himself as co-chairman of theProximity Peace Talks, European Union special representative. To my knowledge,Bildt was unavailable to the hordes of journalists covering the talks, yet herehe was writing me like an old school chum.It's amazing stuff, this Internet. Which brings me to the conclusion of ourworldwide-scoop story.The world knows now that a little paper in the middle of the United States isthe repository of the complete peace agreement. Accesses in early December hit7000 in one day, again from every point of the globe, especially centralEurope.And our list of admirers continues to grow. Our latest e-mail was from noneother than the U.S. State Department itself, which acknowledged it was theDayton Daily News -- not the federal government -- that disseminated theinformation first.Debi Guido-O'Grady, from the State Department's bureau of public affairs,wrote: "Congratulations on an excellent site on the peace talks. You certainlybeat us in getting the full text of the agreement up on the Web."How long do you expect to keep the Dayton site active? While we are notsupposed to link to nonofficial sites, I was thinking of bringing up a 'readingroom' for other great resources for information (like yours) on Bosnia, on theU.S. Department of State's official home page(http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/dosfan.HTML)."Thank you, State Department.

For each, Smolan and 100 or so of his colleagues woulddocument one 24-hour period of life in a single country; each successive entryhas sought to be more technologically ambitious than the last.His highly acclaimed From Alice to Ocean coverage -- photographed in the '70son assignment for National Geographic -- detailed a woman's solo trek acrossthe Australian Outback and became the first combination picture book(Addison-Wesley, 1992, $49.95) and interactive CD-ROM.Most recently, a similar but more sophisticated book-and-CD, Passage toVietnam, were the product of 70 photojournalists spending a week documentinglife throughout the nearly forgotten southeast Asian country, which has changedconsiderably since the end of the war two decades ago.Smolan's multimedia company, based in Sausalito, Calif., has gathered awardshand-over-fist for Passage (Against All Odds, 1995), which skillfully blendsoutstanding still images, maps, text, sound, video and related materials intoan awesome educational production.Innovative features include a three-dimensional navigational device called theQuebe, which gives a user a multitude of ways to experience the graphics-richcontent; several Forrest Gump-like appearances by a digitized Smolan, who dropsinto several still images to narrate, and a gallery where selectedphotographers stroll in and out of the scene while describing theirphotographic portfolios and philosophies.Sounds like a project that may be difficult to top, right? Wrong, at least ifSmolan's Feb. 8 project -- dubbed "24 Hours in Cyberspace: Painting on theWalls of the Digital Cave" -- comes anywhere close to expectations."We have spent the last 12 years traveling around the world, documentingdifferent cultures," said Smolan. "For us, cyberspace is another culture andplace that we are going to, with the goal of documenting it during a typical24-hour time period. But this time around, because of the nature of the newmedium itself, people can actively take part in the project, and respond withtheir own point of view."As with previous efforts, Smolan and his project team will hire and dispatch100 of the world's top photojournalists around the globe to bring back storiesthat reveal the myriad ways global telecommunications technologies areaffecting the professional and personal lives of people.After soliciting story suggestions via the Internet and several commercialservices for the last few months, and screening digital-savvy photographers forpotential participation, the Cyber24 project team is putting in long hours thismonth making final connections and arrangements that should make this one ofthe largest on-line events ever conducted.Karen Mullarkey, a free-lance visual consultant and former director ofphotography at Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone, leads the storydevelopment team. Affiliations with a number of media, military, government andbusiness organizations will supplement the work done by the projectphotographers.Tentative plans include live support from the Associated Press and Reuters, theDepartment of Defense (including peacekeeping photo coverage from Bosnia), theSmithsonian Institution, Nasa, the United Nations and Disney. In addition,millions of people on-line are being invited to submit their own stories of howthe digital revolution is affecting their lives.J. Carl Ganter, an assignment editor for the project, is a veteran photographerfor several of Smolan's Day in the Life projects. But this time, he's on theother side, just one member of the team that's trying to pull this dauntingproject together."The cooperation between cutting-edge firms (and project underwriters) likeAdobe Systems, Sun Microsystems and Eastman Kodak is exciting," he said."Imagine importing a digital picture and running Photoshop in the blink of aneye. To do this, the tech team has put together an amazing high-speed networkto handle the huge blocks of text, digital pictures, audio and video generatedon the day."Ganter, who's also coordinating and editing audio for the project, says webcruisers (http://www.cyber24.com/) will be able to hear photographers' commentsabout their subjects -- minutes after the pictures are published."After photographers transmit their images to headquarters, we'll debrief themby telephone, edit their recorded comments and include them in the site,"Ganter said. "So visitors to Cyber24 will have a chance to be virtually onassignment with the team. There will be a lot of other exciting, cutting-edgemultimedia surprises as well."One of the newest photo technologies to be used is a method for creatinginteractive, 360-degree photographs called PhotoSpheres by merging two separatestill images with software developed by Knoxville-based Omniview Inc.. Ten or12 world landmarks will be photographed and published as spherical scenes onthe project's web site. A special free downloadable OmniView viewer will beneeded to view and navigate inside the images.Mission Control for the project will be in San Francisco's China Basin, whereall photos and stories will be transmitted throughout the "day," a 48-hourperiod as Feb. 8 moves across the world's time zones.On that date, an instant web site will be updated every 30 minutes or so --beginning at midnight Pacific Standard Time -- as new content is received,cataloged into an Illustra database and uploaded to the web pages designed byClement Mok, the former art director of Apple Computer and the designerresponsible for the look of the Microsoft Network.After a few days, the project home page will close. Around March 15, after ateam of editors has had a chance to review all content captured by its selectphotographers and other participants, a permanent "time capsule" web site willopen with additional materials (it will also be a showcase for the latest inweb publishing tools).A picture book and CD will be released in the fall.Faculty at the Rochester Institute of Technology are coordinating "the world'slargest photo classroom," a parallel, collaborative project for journalismeducators and students worldwide. The best stories will be added to theproject's main web site, while the schools also will maintain their own homepages with additional materials related to 24 Hours.Prizes donated by corporate sponsors will be awarded for the top studententries.Global participation on the date is being strongly encouraged; specificationsand submission details are available on the web site. Entries may betransmitted via the Internet or one of several commercial on-line services,including America Online, CompuServe and PressLink.The project will be the featured event at the grand opening of the Internet1996 World Exposition (http://park.org/fair/), a world's fair for theinformation age.Against All Odds (415) 331-6300; e-mail: aaopr@aol.com-- Kurt FossBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE COLE PAPERS via NewsNetJanuary 1996HOW CONSULTANTS CAN PLAY KEY ROLES IN PLANNING BIG PROJECTSOne day recently a friend said to me, "I know you're a consultant, but what doconsultants do and why do people hire them?"I gave him what was essentially a non-answer and we went on to other things.Later, after I'd thought about it a bit, I told him I'd kind of kissed off hisquestion and that, if pressed, I'd have to say this:Consultants help businesses improve profits by helping solve problems, andthere are as many reasons for hiring them as there are problems in running abusiness.Newspapers, for example, hire consultants for a variety of reasons.Sometimes, a specific problem requires technical expertise not found amongthose on the payroll. Planning a computer network, for example, is often aone-time job where a consultant can come in, examine the problem and makerecommendations in a much shorter time than it would take someone on the staffto get up to speed.Often a newspaper can benefit from having a problem looked at by "a fresh eye,"someone who's not too close to the situation -- a person who is not involved ininternal turf wars, nor carries any baggage as far as relationships areconcerned.Remember, too, that many attempts to solve problems end up in finger-pointingand attempts to place blame. An outsider doesn't deal in reward and punishment;he or she is there to focus on fixing the problem.Independent consultants usually get openness from managers and others involvedin a problem simply because they're not involved in the normal officepolitics.Independent consultants often come to you with broader experience and moreindustry contacts than people on your staff, especially at newspapers where fewmanagers attend trade shows or are sent to seminars at such places as theAmerican Press Institute.An independent consultant can be of greatest benefit, in my view, when anewspaper is going to undertake a major project.Newspapers are rarely overstaffed. All the managers work hard at theirday-to-day responsibilities with barely enough time to work on next year'sbudget, let alone take on a major project.These problems multiply when the project -- say, pagination -- is one thatinvolves many departments of the newspaper and affects processes, personnel andequipment in all of them.Working hand-in-hand with the executive assigned to spearhead the project, aconsultant can give it his or her full attention, uninterrupted by the phonecalls that start, "I know you're working on that project, but this littleproblem has come up and can you just take a few minutes to ...?"Also, few newspapers have people on their payroll with the knowledge ofinterdepartmental relationships needed for many major projects.Yes, you can set up a committee, then charge it with studying the issue andcoming up with a recommendation, but unless you have an exceptional group, eachpanelist will view it from his or her own narrow perspective.They need help in seeing the big picture.In pagination projects, for example, newsroom managers more often than not seeonly that it is going to take them longer to deal with pages in the newsroom.What they don't see is the reduction in time, overall, to get the paper on thepress.Part of a consultant's role is to provide that big-picture view. Along with it,a good consultant will also try to make all participants fully aware of howeveryone benefits from a major project. There are benefits for all departmentsof a newspaper from pagination, although sometimes they're hard to see, orattain, without understanding the entire process.When do you need a consultant? When you look around and don't see anyone withthe expertise needed to solve the problem at hand. Or, if you do have someone,you recognize that the enterprise would suffer if you assigned the task as afull-time responsibility.There are times when a consultant can serve as a referee and help you decidewho's right when two department heads make very good cases for doing somethingtheir way.Or, frankly, you might want to bring in a consultant if you'd like to havesomeone from out of town to blame if things go wrong.How do you find a consultant and what should you expect?Talk to other newspapers, talk to suppliers -- they know who's knowledgeable intheir fields. Check out the trade publications. Those are all good places tostart.I've always believed, as does Dave Cole, that consultants do a better job fornewspapers if they are independent and do not also work for or representsuppliers. That's not to say that those who do are necessarily wrong; it's justthat old business of not wanting to appear beholden to anyone.Once you've hit upon a likely prospect, outline your problem and ask for aproposal. You should get -- in writing -- an initial action plan which mostoften will prescribe a day or two of on-site evaluation, discussions with yourmanagers and the promise of a written report with recommendations.The proposal should also include information about fees and expensereimbursement for the initial visit.Suppose you do find someone, you get a proposal and you accept it. Then what?First, tell everyone in your plant that the consultant is coming and why. Thelast thing you want is everybody wondering why there's a stranger poking aroundthe plant for a couple of days.Then, gather those directly involved and ask for their full cooperation. Tellthem you expect them to be candid with the consultant, and that they must cleartheir calendars as much as possible so as to be available while the consultantis in the plant.You're going to be spending a fair amount of money, so you want to be sure thatthe consultant gets the information needed.Arrange for a manager to serve as host, and to use time to best advantage, askthat lunches be arranged with people involved in the project.It's always nice, from the consultant's point of view, to have a place in thebuilding to use as a base. Perhaps the office of the person most involved withthe project or problem would serve best.You should meet privately with the consultant at the beginning and end of thevisit. Be sure that the opening discussion includes your view of the problemand some agreement on expectations.Be candid. If there are personnel problems or peculiar situations to befactored in, discuss them. Ask for and expect discretion. If you want appraisalof personnel, this is the time to ask for it so the consultant can take themeasure of people while assessing the situation from the start.Make it clear that you'll be available should problems or questions arise.It can be beneficial to gather your troops for a session with the consultantjust prior to your end-of-visit interview. That's when any second thoughts canbe aired, or promised information delivered.Expect a reasonably detailed report of findings and recommendations within afew days of the on-site visit. If called for, you'll probably get a proposalfor an ongoing relationship involving oversight, project management or hands-onproblem solving.If a long-term relationship ensues, ask for regular progress reports, both oraland written. Be sure that your people are cooperating fully, and that everyoneunderstands your goals.None of this will insure success, of course, but it will certainly improve theodds against failure.-- Mike MiddlesworthBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE COLE PAPERS via NewsNetJanuary 1996AS LONG AS IT ISN'T ILLEGAL OR IMMORALShortly after I started consulting six years ago, I read somewhere thatconsultants who specialize in technology break into two distinct groups:*Those who come into your office, take off their coat, roll up their sleevesand start writing code or plugging computers into the network.*Those who come into your office and never take off their coat.Because my consulting practice has always used the "we'll do it as long as itisn't illegal or immoral" credo, we have ended up not breaking into either ofthese categories.The no-coat consulting has always been fairly straightforward: you write thecode, you hook up the wires, you make sure it all works and then write somedocumentation about how you did it, so that the newspaper doesn't have to hireyou again to make a minor change.The coat consulting, on the other hand, is rife with the possibility formisunderstandings and bruised feelings. On more than one occasion I've had totell a publisher that his or her biggest problem falls in the personnelcategory: the wrong people in the wrong jobs can be as big a problem as amisprogrammed computer.Another big problem is to be hired to solve one problem but to find a biggerone looming of which the staff is unaware. A couple of times I've been calledin to talk about pagination, only to find ancient classified or businesssystems that would be an impediment to any pagination project. When thepublisher is confronted with having only enough money to buy a paginationsystem or a new classified system, it's not fun to be the one to say the paperhas to postpone pagination until the other systems are brought up to snuff.For me, the hardest part was coming to grips with the situation where thepublisher brings me in, gives me the run of the shop for a couple of days, getsa verbal report before I leave, nodding all the while. And then I phone thepaper six months later to find that nothing has changed.When I was a full-time newspaper employee, I learned to have my advice ignored;I just thought that when I was a consultant that wouldn't happen any longer.But I forgot: this is the publishing business.-- dmcBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE COLE PAPERS via NewsNetJanuary 1996CHAPCHAL OUT AT ISGI AFTER MERGERDanny Chapchal keeps reaching for the brass ring of publishing system supplyfirms -- and keeps missing.The man who put together the deal to buy Atex from Kodak (and who subsequentlylost Atex to the Norwegian software company Sysdeco) had almost built a newpublishing systems powerhouse late in 1995, only to lose control at the lastminute.After turning Atex over to Sysdeco last year (see The Cole Papers, January1995), Chapchal worked out a deal with Integrierte Systeme Grafische Industrie(ISGI) of Eschborn, Germany.ISGI was developed in the early '90s as a publishing systems researchconsortium funded by Siemens Nixdorf and Hell Graphics. Last spring, Chapchalbecame a consultant for what had become Siemens Nixdorf-owned ISGI and puttogether some Siemens Nixdorf PC-based publishing systems products that wereshown at NEXPO '95 in Atlanta (see The Cole Papers, September 1995).The products were well received. ISGI took orders from the New York Daily Newsand the 25,000-circulation evening Reading (Pa.) Eagle.In the latter part of the summer, Chapchal was named chairman of ISGI andimmediately set about finding a partner to build up the company. He found onein Italian investor Tullio Ponzi, who in recent years had built InternationalPublishing Associates Holding Ltd.IPA Systems is a holding company that owns Monotype Publishing Systems ofRolling Meadows, Ill., and the United Kingdom; H. Berthold of the UnitedKingdom; Freedom System Integrators of Wichita, Kan.; QED Technology Ltd. ofCheltenham, England; GB Techniques of Prestwick, Scotland, and ScangraphicPrePress Technology of Wedel, Germany.IPA Systems was created by Ponzi and longtime industry executives Peter Purdyand Charles Crocker in 1992 and '93. Crocker left the business in 1993. Purdydied in October 1994.On Nov. 8, Siemens Nixdorf transferred ownership of ISGI to Scangraphic (alegalistic nicety -- Scangraphic would not take over ISGI's business, and eachwould operate separately).The plan was that Chapchal would be in charge of the new ISGI, which wouldincorporate the resources of Freedom Systems, QED and GB Techniques.Specifically, the deal gave Chapchal a presence in the United States, alongwith a sales force.But within days of finalizing the deal, Ponzi and Chapchal had a falling out.Although Chapchal remains a consultant to ISGI, he is no longer chairman.Along with Chapchal's leave-taking, his lieutenants Ian Anderson and RodFenwick -- who had both worked extensively with Chapchal at both Atex andprevious projects -- also left ISGI.While no plans for the future of ISGI have been announced, the installation atthe Reading Eagle is going forward.As an executive with Linotype in the '70s and early '80s, Chapchal waspresident of its World Systems Inc. division, with corporate responsibilitiesin the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom.In 1984, Chapchal returned to England, where -- in addition to being the chieffund-raiser and chairman of QED Technology -- he was managing director ofApplied Research of Cambridge Ltd., a supplier of turnkey CAD systems.Within two years, Chapchal became chief executive of Xenotron Holdings Plc.Xenotron, a publishing systems supplier emphasizing display advertising makeupsystems, was shortly thereafter sold to the Hell publishing systems group inGermany.Hell ultimately killed Xenotron and most of its innovative technology.Chapchal then orchestrated the sale of QED to Maxwell Communications Corp. andtook a position with Fifth Wave Technology Ltd., a division of Maxwell.He left the publishing systems business in 1991 to run SQL SystemsInternational of Surrey, England, a supplier of asset management software.Insiders indicate that within 18 months, Chapchal turned SQL from a companythat lost millions of dollars into a multimillion-dollar money-maker.In 1993 Chapchal began discussions with Kodak about acquiring its Atexdivision, and put the deal together that December. Chapchal used investors whohad been involved in the SQL restructuring.In the course of his running Atex, those investors lost faith in Chapchal, andin 1994 Sysdeco convinced the Atex board of directors to give it an equityposition in the company and a management contract.Chapchal then began work on the ISGI project.-- dmcBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE COLE PAPERS via NewsNetJanuary 1996P.INK GERMANY ENTERS CHAPTER 11P.INK, the Macintosh-based editorial front-end system whose history has beenmixed at best, has hit another stumbling block: bankruptcy.The German company that developed the software -- P.INK Software EngineeringGmbH of Hamburg -- has filed Vergleichsbeantragung, the German version ofChapter 11 reorganization. This type of bankruptcy filing allows a company tokeep its creditors at bay while it negotiates for better repayment plans and/orthe injection of working capital from new investors.Reports from Germany indicate that P.INK had been planning on a fresh round offinancing from Scitex Corp. Ltd. of Herzlia, Israel -- one of its four owners-- which was not forthcoming.Speculation has implicated Scitex's 1995 third-quarter loss of more than $36.4million as the reason it didn't make the investment. The loss might have leftthe company cash-strapped and incapable of honoring its commitment to buy outtwo of the other three owners of P.INK.Scitex America executives did not respond to numerous phone and e-mail queriesregarding the P.INK situation.Scitex, which markets the P.INK product line outside of Germany, Austria andSwitzerland, bought 25 percent of the company in February 1994 with anagreement to acquire another 50 percent of the company over a two-year period.The remaining 25 percent of P.INK would remain with its founder, president andchief executive, Andreas Poliza.The 50 percent of the company that Scitex was scheduled to acquire has beenowned by the German newspaper publishing group Madsack and a German softwarecompany called Rechenzentrum Sdwest. Rechenzentrum has owned its 25 percent foronly a year.The acquisition of P.INK was engineered by Scitex America Corp. executive BobHolt, a former editor at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Holt, based in Bedford,Mass., spent much of 1993 in Hamburg, stopping off on his way to and fromIsrael to work with Poliza to improve the software and iron out the long-termrelationship.Scitex -- both in Israel and the United States -- has gone through massivereorganizations recently. The head of Scitex America, George Carlisle, left thecompany last summer. In November, Arie Rosenfeld, the president and chiefexecutive of Scitex Corp. Ltd. resigned amidst the fallout from the company'ssizable third-quarter loss.Part of the reason for that loss was an $18 million charge for employeetermination benefits; many longtime Scitex executives have recently left thecompany, including Scitex America's marketing executive Ken Hurtabise andcorporate communications executive Paul Thiele.In addition, Scitex America announced in August the establishment of apublishing division that would be responsible for the P.INK product line aswell as other Scitex products.Scitex has sold the Mac-based P.INK system to two newspapers -- The Sun ofBremerton, Wash., a 41,000-circulation evening daily, and the63,000-circulation morning Evansville (Ind.) Courier. Both papers are owned byScripps-Howard.In addition, Scitex smoothed the installation of P.INK at the Toronto Sun andother Sun Publishing Corp. properties (which include the Calgary Sun, EdmontonSun and Financial Post), even though the Sun papers had purchased the productdirectly from P.INK in Germany.Executives at these papers were reluctant to be quoted about the situation, butindicated that Scitex had told them, as one said, "not to worry.""We've been told that the worst-case scenario is that Scitex will get the NorthAmerican rights to the P.INK code," said one newspaper executive.Despite generally upbeat comments coming from customers, and published reportsthat the staff has "expressed full support for the company," sources in Germanyindicate that P.INK programmers are extensively circulating their resumes.The P.INK story in North America is not a happy one: Demonstrated under theP.INK Software banner at ANPA/Tec 1990, the North American marketing rights forthe product were acquired in 1991 by the Time Magazine Group division of mediagiant Time Warner.For the next two years, P.INK America attempted to sell its software to itssibling divisions -- magazines such as Time, People and long-time Mac userEntertainment Weekly -- and newspapers and other magazines as well.The potential customers, inside Time or not, were decidedly uninterested. In1993, Time shut down P.INK America. It was another year before Scitex made itsdeal, and despite the Scripps-Howard sales the company has had problemsbuilding momentum for the product line.-- dmcBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE COLE PAPERS via NewsNetJanuary 1996MARK YOUR CALENDARSAttending industry-related conferences, expositions and meetings frequentlyrequires more advanced planning than our monthly listings can take intoaccount.

Only a few suppliers have chosen to displaytheir wares at Winter Consumer Electronics Show (WCES).     IBM is biggest computer-related company with products ondisplay.  Hardware from consumer Aptiva line will be shown, as willsoftware from its Multimedia Publishing Studio.  "We're going tohave a large booth," spokeswoman said.  Although CES no longer ishot show from multimedia standpoint, attendance totals alone makeevent worth attending, she said.  "They feel like there is still alarge draw to CES," she said.  Still, company is almost apologeticabout its presence.  "It's not a big launch," she said.  "We'resetting up a booth and demoing a lot of new products and having apresence."     As exhibitor, IBM is in tiny minority of multimedia hardwareand software companies.  Even though Packard Bell and others haveexhibited, it looks as though Compaq will be only other major PCsupplier in Las Vegas.  As for software, Microsoft will have hotelrooms but no floor presence.  And small players such as GoodtimesInteractive, which presented at last year's WCES, are almostcompletely absent.     Multimedia companies said CES just doesn't work as platformfor them any more.  "We painfully exhibited at the last summerCES," High Technology Distribution Pres. Perry Solomon said.  HighTechnology sells variety of computer memory products, includingrecordable CD-ROM drives, through its Smart & Friendly unit.  "Igrew up in the consumer electronics industry, and we certainly feelthat the consumer electronics channel is a valid one for ourproducts," he said.  "But we're not 100% sure that the Winter CESis an appropriate forum."  For Smart & Friendly, must shows areWinter Comdex and CeBit in Hamburg, Solomon said.     One show rules on entertainment software side:  Los AngelesElectronic Entertainment Expo (E3), coming in spring.  Althoughonly in 2nd year, E3 has secure position as top software forum inU.S. for videogame and PC entertainment software, robbing CES ofits largest combined exhibitor category.  "We'll be at E3,"Microsoft Senior Group Mktg. Mgr. Marty Taucher said.  "We've gota fairly substantial space in the main hall."     That doesn't mean Microsoft -- or Smart & Friendly, for thatmatter -- is writing off WCES completely.  "It's not clear to uswhether CES will have a big role for us in the future, but we'dlike to keep our options open," Taucher said.  "We'll be at suitesand doing meetings, but we won't have a floor presence."     Smart & Friendly's main market is business users, Solomonsaid.  But PC products are evolving so that eventually they will beconsumer electronics products, he said.  That's why he's taking a"wait-and-see" attitude with WCES.  He hoped show would regain someof its multimedia strength but isn't certain it will.  Summer CES'sdecline as major show was very upsetting, he said.  "I've attendedso many CESes over so many years, and to watch a show that was sostrong and so powerful die was painful to me," he said.  "It provesyou've got to stay close to the market all the time.  I don't knowwhat happened, but somehow it lost its course."     In attempt to provide some multimedia energy to mix, CES hasadded 2 seminars to workshop:  "Multimedia Software Distribution: The New Model" and "Multimedia:  What Is the Consumer Looking For." Other panels already scheduled include "The Desktop PC Market --What Consumers Want," computer manufacturer executive panel and"Riding the Consumer Interactive Wave."  Strangely, CompaqPres.-CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer is show's keynote speaker.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER MULTIMEDIA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FEW SURPRISES IN SPECIFICS FOR UNIFIED 'DVD' FORMAT     New unified high-density optical disc format will be called"DVD" and will feature Dolby AC-3 digital audio for NTSC markets,MPEG audio for PAL and SECAM countries.     Those were highlights of mid-Dec. announcement thatnegotiators for former MultiMedia CD (MMCD) and Super Density (SD)had completed work in Tokyo on technical specifications of unifiedDVD format for PC ROM and home theater applications that's said tocombine best features of rival systems.  While agreement ontechnical specs appeared to give green light to startlabor-intensive effort of designing final components for late-1996launch, patent and licensing issues hadn't been addressed.  PhilipsKey Modules Pres. Jan Oosterveld, company's key negotiator inunification talks, said no fewer than 9 working groups had beenformed to hash out remaining administrative issues.  He refused toproject how long effort might take other than to say it would haveto be finished before products can be launched in 1996.     Main specifications are same as those reported 3 months agowhen warring parties announced preliminary pact on unified standard(CMR Sept 18 p1).  Basic disc is adapted from SD proposal forbonded 5" media composed of 2 layers, each 0.6 mm thick.  Datacapacity is 4.7 gigabytes per side, using "RS-PC" error correctionsystem from SD proposal, "8-16" modulation system from MMCDproposal.  System operates at average data transfer rate of 4.69mbps.  Of 11 main technical points that comprise basic system,Oosterveld said unified format draws equally from MMCD and SDproposals.     Unified system adopts Dolby AC-3 as mandatory choice in NTSCcountries for DVD digital audio, with MPEG audio as option. Reverse is true in PAL and SECAM markets.  Oosterveld said decisionusing 2 digital audio systems in world heeds suggestions by movieindustry to adopt pattern consistent with disparity in TV standardsas means of controlling international distribution of home videorepertoire for copyright purposes.     As for DVD name, briefing documents obtained by our affiliatednewsletter Audio Week said that while DVD is "formal name" ofunified format, "it is not meant to be an abbreviation foranything, though in the past it stood for digital videodisc." Negotiators said "we believe the 'V' can also stand for'versatile.'"  Documents said 9 companies "will now undertakediscussions in an effort to develop a patent licensing system." Companies listed are Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Philips,Pioneer, Sony, Time Warner, Toshiba.  Roster didn't includeThomson, which was described as having "worked closely on DVDdevelopment" and "has expressed a desire to join the discussion."     "From today on," statement said, "the companies supporting DVDwill propose and promote a wide range of applications for theformat.  They will continue to develop the technology and work toposition DVD optical discs as the ideal storage medium for the ageof multimedia."  Companies said they plan soon to announce logo foruse on all DVD movie players and ROM drives.  Oosterveld said"competition" period officially has begun, meaning no formatwidepromotional booth is planned at Consumer Electronics Show or othertrade events.     DVD "core" developers -- Philips, Sony, Matsushita and Toshiba-- are expected to form joint corporation to administer DVDpatents.  Secondary tier of companies laying claim to inventionsincorporated into unified DVD standard would join patent pool. Toshiba sources in Tokyo told us Thomson had resisted proposal,expressing preference to enforce own optical disc licenses. However, same sources said later that Thomson had tempered itsopposition to pool system in bid to project united industry frontin promoting DVD awareness before late-1996 launch.     Negotiators tiptoed around questions on DVD video copyprotection, and briefing papers suggested only that variety of"options are possible."  Sakon Nagasaki, dir. of Matsushita DVDPromotion Office, told Tokyo news conference that he expectsadoption of Copy Generation Management System (CGMS), now beingdeveloped by numerous companies.  He said CGMS would form basis oflegislation in U.S. based on proposal being negotiated by hardwarecompanies and movie industry.     Copyright holders warned that unless protection issue issettled, they won't put material on DVD.  "Our excitement for theDVD format continues to grow," MCA Home Video Pres. Louis Feolasaid.  "However, in the event there is not an encryption mechanismthat prevents all forms of copying, whether digital to digital ordigital to analog, we will in all likelihood not be supporting theformat," he told us.  He said acceptable DVD encryption system"must be applied to all forms of hardware, including computers."     In separate development, Thomson signed "multiproduct" OEMdeal with unnamed Japanese manufacturer covering "digital andvideo" products, including DVD players that can be sold in U.S. aslow as $500 starting late in 1996, Exec. Vp Joseph Clayton said. Thomson is expected to identify Japanese partner at Las Vegas newsconference set for eve of this week's Consumer Electronics Show.     DVD technology already is advancing.  Sanyo said it developednew laser pickup capable of reading DVDs and conventional CDs. Dual-use red laser pickup, which will have output power of 5 mw,will be built using DVD wavelength of 635 nanometers, one of 2wavelengths specified in unified DVD format announced Dec. 8. Unlike existing dual-focus pickups requiring use of 2 lenses, Sanyodevice uses LCD shutter system to change characteristic of laserneeded for specific types of disc.  Sanyo said LCD method makes forsmaller and more reliable pickup.  Sample shipments will start inMarch, Sanyo said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER MULTIMEDIA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996DSS PRICING FOLLOWING CE ROUTE -- DOWN     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to dropand competition increases, entry-level product appears poised todip below $300 -- or even less -- consistent with traditionalconsumer electronics pattern.     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  To combat falling prices,some retailers are focusing on step-up RCA and Sony DSS productsthat promise 20-25% profit margins but slower sales.  Overall, 1995unit sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expected tosurpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close tomillion subscribers.     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers,who have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones wherehardware is offered to consumers virtually free and profits aremade on service.  Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostarhasn't released pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardwareretails could hit $500, with programming at $20.     Lower retails are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshibaand Uniden enter DSS this year, with Uniden already indicating itmay price product at $499-$549.  In addition to DSS, Alphastar andEchostar plan to introduce own services, latter partnering withPhilips to bring Magnavox product to CE retail.  Even Primestar,which primarily has leased equipment to consumers, has tested salesthrough TCI.     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCAand GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has beenadvertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony piece recently brokebelow suggested list price in Wiz ad at $648.     DSS installation charge also has dropped in some markets to$99 vs. $150 range when product was introduced in 1994.  Signs arethat pricing trends will gather momentum as market and number ofsuppliers expands.  Two recent entrants provide examples:  Unidenand AlphaStar.  Uniden will ship 2 DSS products by mid-1996 at$499-$549, Exec. OEM Vp Hide Kanakubo said.  AlphaStar will launchmedium-power satellite service late in first quarter with productat $600-$700 and sales limited to distributors and directmarketers, Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein said.     Uniden systems will sell in packages that include integratedreceiver decoder (IRD), 18" dish, low-noise blocker (LNB), remotecontrol.  Production is expected to begin in April, deliveries inMay, Kanakubo said.  Uniden has said it was considering hybridproduct compatible with C-band system as well as possibly buildingIRD into other CE products.  First 2 models will be standaloneunits, Kanakubo said.     With Thomson's low-end RCA DSS product already appearingadvertised at $499, Uniden will have to hit lower retails, Kanakubosaid.  "The expectation at retail is that Uniden will be pricedlower than RCA or Sony," he said.  Lower prices could cross $400barrier in 1996, industry observers said.  To differentiate itselfin market that also is expected to include Toshiba by mid-1996,Uniden will sell products through satellite distributors and CEretailers, Kanakubo said.     Companies are taking variety of approaches to avoid dealingwith margin-slashing consumer electronics market.  Alphastar isavoiding retail channel, relying on combination of Amway, satellitedistributors and multilevel marketing.  Company will sell singleIRD with 30" dish and remote control to satellite dealers throughdistributor O'Rourke Bros. and to consumers through Amway andmultilevel marketer United Digital Bcstg. Corp.  Programming willbe sold in packages at $24-$49, with some consisting of 40 videoand 30 audio channels.  Premium pay packages and a la cartechannels will retail at $4.95-$14.95 per month, 16 PPV channels at$2.99 per movie.     Full 120-channel service, to be available within 2-3 weeks oflaunch, will consist of 85 video, 30 audio and 3-5 data services. IRD contains RS-232 port to connect to PC to download data servicesas well as gain access to Internet, Klippenstein said.  IRD alsowill use MPEG-2 data transmission and have LED.     Tightly focused marketing is key to AlphaStar's approach,Klippenstein said.  "We're targeting specific customer bases ratherthan going with a mass market approach that requires huge inputs ofadvertising, media, and consumer electronics distribution," hesaid.  Giveaway DSS systems are almost inevitable, Klippensteinsaid.  "I would think that for this product the equipment wouldpass the cost curve much more rapidly than the marketing cost ofattracting a subscriber," he said.  "When that happens it makessense to give the box away because the long-term value is in thesubscription and the ongoing revenue that comes from thatsubscription."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER MULTIMEDIA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FATALITIES THREATENED IN CHINA PIRACY WAR     Sums involved in hardware and software piracy are spurringthreats of physical harm in China, where illegal videogame consoletotal rivals legal units in U.S.     War of words over piracy is threatening to turn into realthing, as videogame cartridge and console and CD-ROM softwarecontraband markets explode.  "The gray market is our biggestcompetitor worldwide," said executive with one leading videogamecompany.     China is leading violator on both CD-ROM and videogame fronts-- but Eastern Europe is working hard to catch up.  There are 297CD and CD-ROM plants in world, of which 30 are in China, andpirated copies represent 59% of China's CD market, according toLondon-based International Federation of Phonographic Industry(IFPI).  Relatively new area for piracy is Bulgaria, with 4 CDproduction lines in 3 plants.  Until Sept. 6, when 2 long-standingEuropean copyright conventions came into effect in Bulgaria, therewas no protection for foreign recordings, so all 3 plants wereproducing unauthorized copies.  That situation is beginning tochange, copyright activists report.      One sign of intensity of struggles was recent temporaryshutdown of IFPI's Guangzhou, China, office.  "We've heard throughsomebody that contract killers have been employed," said IFPICommunications Dir. Catrin Hughes.  Leads were "pretty solid," shesaid.  "It's not the sort of thing you take a chance on."  IFPIoffices in Beijing and Shanghai remain open, and Canton office willgo back on line as soon as threat is resolved, she said.  Thisisn't first time IFPI has had to shut down office -- in recentyears, threats forced temporary closures in Thailand and Taiwan. "We reopened in Taiwan, and now we've cleaned up the market,"Hughes said.     While CD-ROM piracy snares spotlight, black market videogamecartridge activity is soaring.  Almost nonissue as recently as1988, cartridge piracy is costing publishers at least $1-$1.5billion annually, said Nintendo of America (NOA) Gen. Counsel LynnHvalsoe.  Aggressive legal efforts have stunted counterfeit salesin U.S., but unlawful products are rampant in Asia and LatinAmerica, she said.  At close to 20 million, total number of illegalNintendo Super Entertainment System (SNES) consoles in China equalsinstalled base in U.S.  Estimates of total number of counterfeitNintendo cartridges sold in China come to 100 million units ormore, she said.     CD-ROM and game cartridge pirate situations are fundamentallydifferent because of media used by 2 formats.  For one, while Chinais producer of pirate CD-ROM product, it's primarily consumer ofcounterfeit videogames.  There are almost 300 CD-ROM plantsworldwide, but just 12 can produce high-density read-only memorychips used in videogame cartridges.  Most of those are in Japan, S.Korea, Taiwan.     Sophisticated pirates don't just duplicate games, theyreproduce artwork as well, Hvalsoe said.  Difference betweenlegitimate and pirate box often is little more than lightercontrast on illegal copy, and sometimes fake name.  That makesantipiracy activities in developed and undeveloped countries farmore difficult, she said.     "They copy both trademarked and copyrighted material," Hvalsoesaid.  Getting data out of cartridges is relatively easy;  all ittakes is fairly inexpensive E-PROM or ROM reader.  Nintendo investssignificant amounts of time and money encrypting its games to makelife more difficult for pirates, but such strategies don't workagainst determined assault.  "We do have some pretty sophisticatedcopy protection," she said, but "we know that no matter howsophisticated our copy protection is, the pirates will find a wayto get around it."     There are numerous ways to detect even well-made pirateproduct, Hvalsoe said:  (1) Print quality, since even good boxesare simply copies of old ones.  (2) Product quality, becausepirates often use glue rather than screws to hold game cartridgestogether.  (3) Company names, since many suppliers put false nameseven on realistic artwork.  (4) Price, since counterfeit cartridgesusually are priced far below legitimate ones.     Going after chipmakers themselves isn't easy.  Although plantsare few, strategies for disguising chips are many.  Intensivedetective activities are required to ferret out where illegalcopies were made.  Taking action against chip manufacturers also isdifficult.  "We've not had success in Korea or Taiwan suingpeople," Hvalsoe said.  So Nintendo is taking advantage of LanhamAct, which allows companies to sue offshore manufacturers in U.S.courts if their products are being used illegally.  Most major chipproducers have significant activity and assets in U.S., so actionstaken here can have significant impact overseas, she said.     Pricing is another defensive strategy.  In China, Nintendo isselling product "at a significantly reduced value," Hvalsoe said,with cartridges selling for 50% or more off U.S. price and withmany games going for just $20-$30.  Yet illegitimate games stillwin price competition.  In China, taking legal action just doesn'tseem to work, she said.  "When someone's selling hundreds ofthousands of games, they might fine them $100," she said.     Latin America is another hotbed of pirate sales, Hvalsoe said. "We've seen a tremendous amount of activity in Panama and alsoParaguay," she said.  Company is mounting intensive antipiracyeducation campaign aimed at Latin American Customs officials. Nintendo also is pushing for aggressive legal action against LatinAmerican pirates.  Hundreds of thousands of cartridges were seizedrecently in Panamanian Free Trade Zone.     Living up to its reputation as intensely litigious company,Nintendo has several hundred suits pending worldwide, Hvalsoe said. Company is working with International Intellectual PropertyAlliance and other organizations to try to beat back tide ofunlawful product.  Most successful efforts seem to be in U.S.,where game piracy seems virtually dormant.     Even antipiracy action can have twist in China.  ChinaFoundation for Consumer Protection has created prize to encourageconsumer action against bootleg goods, and recently awarded 5,000yuan ($600) to Wang Hai.  But award was very controversial, sincemany felt Wang was unfairly exploiting China's Law on Protection ofConsumers' Rights and Interests.  That law requires that storescompensate customers for twice the value of fake products returned.

Rulemaking will deal with demarcationbetween customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal leakage andquality, technical standards, customer-premises equipment (CPE),division of state and federal responsibilities.     FCC Chmn. Hundt said owning wiring "can be a tremendouscompetitive advantage" for incumbent, and new rules could makecable CPE market as competitive as telephone equipment market.     Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1) What demarcation point wouldbe appropriate, acknowledging it might be different forsingle-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2) Whether telcos'broadband services should have to meet same signal leakage andsignal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable should haveto standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system, as telcoshave for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same regulatorydistinctions between residential and nonresidential wiring astelcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to in-homebroadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to divideregulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise authorities,states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal regulation oftelephony and video programming.     FCC tentatively concluded that cable customers should havesame rights to connect their own CPE to cable as telco customershave.  It said it believes that it may be appropriate to deregulatecable equipment rates after market becomes competitive and aftertransition period.  Rulemaking seeks comment on whether Commissionhas authority to deregulate equipment rates.     Commission rejected petitions for reconsideration filed byNynex and others asking to move demarcation point betweencustomer-owned and operator-owned wiring for multiple dwellingunits.  Comr. Chong said demarcation point, currently 12" outsidesubscriber premises, often isn't accessible to competitors, so itreduces likelihood of competition.  Agency did set rulemaking todetermine whether persons other than individual subscribers shouldbe able to buy wiring in some circumstances.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER MULTIMEDIA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 199616-BIT GAMES HOLD SHARE AMID 64-BIT BATTLES     "Old-fashioned" 16-bit videogame systems probably will hold onto major market share even in 1996 as manufacturers wage war ofwords, titles and marketing dollars over high-powered newtechnology.     Sparking latest contretemps were comments by 3DO Chmn. William(Trip) Hawkins that internal "bus" structure of Nintendo Ultra 64would severely limit performance of system overall and was like"squeezing a fire hose into a garden hose."     "That's bull," said Nintendo of America Sales & Mktg. Exec. VpPeter Main.  At issue is ability of Nintendo system to moveinformation from one part of machine to another.  Some portions ofNintendo machine use 32-bit bus structure.  Hawkins says that willlimit system performance.  Main and Nintendo engineers say itwon't.  What's clear is that 64-bit battles definitely will end updominating media coverage and high-end videogame scene -- butperhaps not dollar volume.     Introduction of Ultra 64 in Japan is absolute lock for April21, Main said.  Picture in U.S. is far fuzzier, with potentiallaunch dates in May-Aug. range.  Some observers are betting onspring launch themed on Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in L.A. If that's to be case, Nintendo will have to resort to some fast adfootwork.  In visit last week to company's Redmond, Wash., hq, wewere told that no ads had been placed in game fan periodicals, eventhough deadlines were drawing near.  Another sign that Ultra maycome later rather than sooner:  Despite flying half-dozenjournalists to Redmond, Nintendo could show only Ultra 64videotape, not game itself.     One thing is sure:  1995 was tough year for videogameindustry, Nintendo included.  "This year was called the great yearof confusion," Main said.  One big challenge is that primaryaudience -- boys 8-12 years old -- is becoming more choosy thanever and willing to skip products that don't offer dramatic edge inperformance and game play.  "We're dealing with 8-12-year-oldsacting like 35-40-year-olds in terms of savvy," Main said.  Thathas resulted in good and bad news for Nintendo;  software saleshave been strong, but company's new hardware introduction, VirtualBoy, is struggling so hard that company is planning "relaunch" inU.S. and Japan.     "It was the year of hits, not bits," Main said, with winnerdetermined by "who is going to have the greatest content."  Hepointed to Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country 2 as both hit and goodsoftware product.  "Even while other software is selling at at best60% to 70% of last year's totals, this one has worldwide demand of110% to 120%," he said.  One sign that strength of 16-bit marketcaught Nintendo as well as most of rest of videogame market bysurprise is the fact that DKC2 is sold out on global basis.  Mainpredicted 16-bit strength would continue to lesser degree through1996.  "At this time next year, [16-bit] is going to represent 35%to 40% of the videogame market," he said.     While Donkey Kong may be doing well, rest of videogame marketisn't setting any records.  Projections were that game market wouldbe down 5% to 20%, Main said.  He thinks total decline will be10-12%, with U.S. videogame dollar volume at $3.8-$3.9 billion. Once counted out, 16-bit products represent 2/3 of that, he said. Market share of 16-bit games has declined to 66% of total sales in1995 from 77% last year.  Hand-held market share also slumped, downto 15-16% this year from 25% last year.  That still representssignificant volume.  "We've got 19 million Game Boys sold," Mainsaid.  "This year we'll be moving 5.7 million pieces."     New technology, including 32-bit games and Virtual Boy,account for fraction of total market, 19%, Main said.  He estimatedthat fewer than one million 32-bit consoles would be sold.  Of thatnumber, Sony's Playstation accounted for 400,000-500,000, Sega'sSaturn 200,000, 3DO 150,000 and with Atari's Jaguar and otherdevices accounting for rest.  By contrast, 16-bit Super NintendoEntertainment system sold 2.4 million, he said.  Virtual Boy'ssales were far under expectations, Main admitted:  "It's been along year for Virtual Boy in the U.S."  Even though 3D game playingunits have sold far under expectations, "we are not finished withVirtual Boy," Main said.     Nintendo has sold 400,000 Virtual Boys in U.S., 250,000 inJapan, he said.  Games released for unit just scratch surface ofits unique capabilities, Main said.  In Japan, "they are planningto relaunch the product in February," he said, with similarrelaunch in U.S.  "It has not seen its full potential.  It's goingto have another round."     One area Nintendo isn't planning to explore is CD-ROMvideogames.  Cost structures in CD-ROM market benefitmanufacturers, not consumers, Main said.  When it comes to addingbulk memory capacity to Ultra 64, Nintendo will stick withrecordable magnetic disc that company has already announced, hesaid.  Disc will move at 8 times CD-ROM speed, he said.  Positionmay leave Nintendo vulnerable when DVD hits market, since competingM-2 and Sony Playstation systems reportedly will be able to playback DVD discs with relatively simple upgrade.  Signs are thatUltra 64, with its proprietary magnetic discs, won't have thatcapability.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER MULTIMEDIA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FORMAT WARS LOOM OVER DVD MUSIC CAPABILITIES     Software and hardware companies are moving to carve out slicesof potentially vast DVD music market.  It looks as though formatwar that was avoided over video DVD will erupt on sound side.     Several entities are exploring DVD music potential -- orbattling for different sound formats.  Engineering Committee ofRecording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA) has formed task force toinvestigate applications of high-density music discs, Exec. VpDavid Leibowitz said.  Sony is showing hush-hush technology calledDirect Stream Digital (DSD) that will form backbone of its proposalfor adapting DVD disc for ultra-high-fidelity music applications. And Pioneer and Philips are touting their own DVD music solutions.     Sony claimed DSD will deliver frequency response up to 100 kHzand dynamic range better than 120dB, on ground that any new musicproposal will have to represent "quantum leap" in sonic performancefrom existing CD if it's to succeed.  Sony executives aredescribing system as "radical departure" from linear PCM technologyused in existing CD system.  Beauty of DSD, they said, is thatsystem is "scalable" for variety of future archival or digitaldelivery applications.     DVD discs will hold 100 min. of 2-channel stereo music, SonySoftware Dir.-Sound Technology Mktg. David Kawakami said.  He saidDSD also can be adapted easily for multichannel music-onlyapplications.  He said Sony is confident 4.7-Gb DVD would becapable of holding at least 74 min. of multichannel music, samecapacity as existing audio CD.     Sony DSD proposal already has drawn sharp attacks.  DSD alsois likely to face competition from other proponents such as Philipsand Pioneer, which are developing their own systems.  Little isknown about Philips' PCM-based proposal, which is believed to carryworking name OmniDisc, and puts strong emphasis on multichannelcapabilities.  Pioneer had been floating proposal within SDAlliance for 2-stage DVD music application, touting 24-bit, 96-kHzoversampling.     DSD wasn't only source of DVD music battles.  Dolby Labspredictably welcomed word that unified DVD format includes AC-3audio as mandatory standard for NTSC markets and optional systemfor PAL and SECAM countries.  But usually staid and conservativelicensor also took opportunity to remove gloves and attack Philipsfor week-earlier claims that MPEG audio is "superior" to AC-3 insound quality and future upgradability.  In criticizing Philipsclaims, Dolby Vp Edward Schummer was referring to report quotingPhilips spokeswoman as saying MPEG has been found to have bettersound quality than AC-3 in comparative listening tests her companyhas run.  She also said MPEG audio has future upgradability for7.1-channel surround.     Because MPEG multichannel audio decoder chips aren't "readilyavailable," Dolby said in report, "it is assumed" that consumerhardware would be based at start on 2-channel devices.  Two-stepstrategy of introducing DVD audio as "stereo today, multichanneltomorrow" means that "limitations" of MPEG audio "can remainlargely unknown until some time in the future, long after thedecision [adopting system for DVD] has been made," Dolby said.     Choosing DVD audio standard for unified specs once had beendescribed as "minor issue" when former MultiMedia CD (MMCD) andSuper Density (SD) alliances announced preliminary truce agreement3 months ago.  However, debate between adopting MMCD-supported MPEGaudio and SD-endorsed AC-3 system appears to have gone down towire, reportedly because Philips -- in breaking with Sony -- hadbeen lobbying heavily, to no avail, for worldwide adoption of MPEGas mandatory DVD sound system.     While Dolby was depicting AC-3 as winner in DVD derby, realloser was DTS, which had ridden Matsushita's coattails and wondesignation from now-moot SD Alliance as optional DVD sound systemin NTSC markets along with mandatory choice of AC-3.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER MULTIMEDIA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HOTELS AND AIRLINES EMERGING AS VIDEOGAME MARKETS     Systems that allow consumers to play videogames in hotel roomsand while they're flying are beginning to achieve significantmarket penetration.     At least 200,000 hotel rooms are equipped with game playcapability for Nintendo products alone, said Nintendo of America(NOA) Engineering Dir. Russel Braun.  Penetration is fairlysignificant, since there are about 1.6 million hotel rooms in U.S.,of which only about 800,000 are in facilities upscale enough towant to provide gaming service.  "Real discount chains won't wantto add amenities like this," he said.     Airlines have lot further to go.  About 35,000 seats have gamecapability, Braun said, on such airlines as Cathay Pacific,Singapore Airlines, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, China Air. One reason for slower progress:  Cost.  Expense of installingsystem comes to about $1.5 million per plane, and weight is equalto that of 4 passengers.  But payoff can be dramatic -- Cathaycalculated that if it gets just 2 more passengers per plane,additional revenues will come to $1 million.     On airplanes, each seat has own screen, mounted using flexibleshaft.  Besides videogames, screens can carry movies and publicservice announcements.  Consumer reception so far seems strong,with one caveat:  Seatmates sometimes object to language used bystruggling game players.     Instead of selling game services directly to hotels, Nintendoworks through distributors of pay-TV systems.  "They put it in thehotel and they manage it," Braun said.  Game systems will work onlyin hotels with pay-TV systems;  when such systems are installed,it's possible to get game play technology up and running for only$35-$50 per room.  That's because system is centralized -- eachroom has only game controller, with single main unit handling gameplay activity.     Relatively small game system can handle fairly large hotel,since in average hotel of 100 rooms only about 20 TV sets will beon.  Current record for continuous hotel game play:  12 hours atone stretch.  Bill for play was reportedly far more than bill forstay, but customer reportedly paid without whimper.      Hotels don't pay for installation, pay-TV distributors do. Hotels then get 10% of game revenue.  Consumers can select any oneof 10 videogames and pay $4.95 per hour.  Selection can be changedrelatively easily, but switch requires in-person visit by cableoperator.  Most popular Nintendo game is Super Mario World.  Vastmajority of hotel rooms are in U.S., but providers are stagingaggressive push for other countries.  U.K. opened up last month; plans are to enter Japan in Jan., with Brazil on list for 1996 aswell.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER MULTIMEDIA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996TOUGH TIMES FOR BIG RETAILERS     By and large, few retailers cheered holiday season, but storesthat specialized in broader product lines seemed to face mostdifficult struggles.  Some chains are trying to make comebacks fromthe near dead.  Others are battling to avoid extinction themselves.     Biggest victim of rough retail era is K mart, which staved offimmediate threat of bankruptcy in late Dec. after reachingagreement with creditors and eliminating common stock dividend. Creditors agreed to delay payments on $548 million in real estatebonds.  Original terms called for K mart to pay sum backimmediately if its bond rating were cut to junk-bond level. Moody's has downgraded K mart senior debt to notch above junk bond. Retailer also eliminated 12 cents-per-share quarterly dividend thatcould result in saving $220 million yearly.     Tandy's Incredible Universe (IU) and Computer City (CC) areexpected to post losses this year.  Board authorized buyback of upto 5 million shares in bid to ward off shareholder discontentfollowing collapse of stock to $37 from $64.  Tandy has battled toimprove operations of 2 of its chains, CC and IU, latter projectedby analysts to lose $11 million this year.  Stock buyback bid isTandy's 2nd following 12.5-million-share program in 1994.     Another operation trying to make it back from brink is 47thSt. Photo.  Fresh from purchase by Tuttnauer, 47th St. Photo saidit's is planning possible public stock offering to open 2 newstores in 1996.  N.Y.C. retailer, which will seek listing onNasdaq, will use money to open 15,000-sq.-ft. stores in LowerManhattan and Long Island, said Tut Services Pres.-CEO Stuart Held,whose firm is holding company for 47th St.     Stores would be first that 47th St. Photo has opened sincefiling for bankruptcy in 1992.  Since then, chain, which once had$300 million annual sales, closed 3 stores, including namesake on47th St., but maintained 45th St. location.     Plans include boost in PC market presence and catalog sales,executives said.  47th St. will ship 6 catalogs in 1996 targetingniches within photography and CE, Held said.  Mail order accountsfor 20% of sales, although plans are to expand it to 30-35%, hesaid.  Held projected sales of $50-$60 million in 1996.  Companyalso will boost presence in PCs, which represent 28-30% of sales. Held said:  "PCs have been ignored up until now because it took somuch money to go into that area, but now that we're starting tosettle our finances we will become aggressive again."     Still another retailer expanding after trying time is TopsAppliance City.  Tops, which has battled to bring finances intoline, said it has selected site in Brooklyn to open 60,000-sq.-ft.store and will shift to full commission for sales staff in early1996.  Brooklyn store would be N.J. chain's 9th.  Chain also hassought to boost home office business, adding new fixtures in someoutlets to increase assortment of PC software and peripherals. Tops gradually has boosted amount of PC software its stores carrysince 1994 when it moved to 100 titles from 25.     Experiencing relatively smooth growth is Tower Records, whichjust expanded into Canada, opening 22,500-sq.-ft. store in Toronto.

"We're doing some work with DVD," said Linden Rhoads, pres.and co-founder of Virtual iO, Seattle.  Company's glasses weighless than 1 lb. and display images on 0.7" LCD screens about 1"from viewer's eyes.  Image is surprisingly clear, but also revealsflaws, with pixels relatively visible.     Since first shipments 7 months ago, Virtual has sold 40,000pairs of glasses priced at $799, said Rhoads, who said companyprojects sales of "several hundred thousand" in 1996, based onexpectation that cable networks will offer 3D shows next year. Video/DVD version of glasses at start will sell for $599, she said,with prices going "down to $299 over the next couple of years," but$199 and $99 probably aren't within reach because of costs.     Rhoads said Virtual is working with Matsushita, which probablywill distribute its glasses in Japan.  Primary goal is to createuniform plug that will carry audio, video and power over same line. As things stand, users would need separate battery pack to powerplayers and headgear.  Negotiations should result in "simple andelegant" connector that does whole job with one cable, she said.     Virtual iO glasses provide rough equivalent of NTSC quality. Recent deal with Planar Systems, Rhoads said, will let company makeleap from LCD displays to electroluminescent (EL) technology.  LCDdisplays are limited effectively to 60,000 pixels, but EL displayscan make possible 350,000-pixel screen that should be available inmid-1996, offering full Virtual Graphics Array (VGA) qualityresolution, with 500,000-pixel model on market in about year.     Virtual iO's investors include TCI, Thomson CSF and Logitech,Rhoads said, and company has exclusive deal to provide Sony withvirtual reality (VR) glasses for PlayStation, to be shipped in 1996first quarter, she said.  Glasses will provide full 3D effect forspecial 3D games.  Game glasses will feature "head tracking,"turning images as user turns head, up, down or sideways.     "Cybersickness" isn't issue, Rhoads said, referring to flawthat has plagued all 3D video systems in past -- includingdizziness, nausea, headache.  But even some Virtual staffers saythey have experienced twinges with more intense VR games.  Anotherpotential health hazard -- walking into traffic while wearingheadgear -- won't be problem, she said.  Glasses have see-throughscreens, and users are expected to use them while seated in buses,at home or waiting in line.     Besides working with CE companies, Virtual is negotiating withvoice recognition supplier, Rhoads said, on system allowing usersto control glasses with words rather than reaching for switch orcontrol.  When SVGA glasses go on market, she said, they could makelaptop PC screens obsolete.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER MULTIMEDIA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996     Iva Wilson named to new post of Philips N.

He is widely known for his regularreports on CNBC and previously as a columnist for USA Today.CNBC, which continued to air Dorfman's regular reports after hewas put on leave by Money, said it was standing by him."We believe that a presumption of guilt coupled with a blanketrequest for all sources could have a chilling effect on theability of journalists to do their jobs and protect the publicinterest," the cable channel said in a statement.It added it had no reason to believe Dorfman had violated anylaw or failed to adhere to the standards of the company."Under these circumstances, CNBC has no reason to follow Moneymagazine's approach in demanding that Mr. Dorfman disclose theidentify of all his sources," it said.In a story on the firing that aired after Dorfman's scheduledsegment Wednesday, CNBC quoted Dorfman as saying that Time Inc.had made demands on him that "no responsible reporter canaccept," requiring him to disclose the names of everyconfidential source for every story that had appeared in the 10columns that he wrote for Money.He also noted that he was not asked for the identity of hissources before the columns were published.

IBM FORMALLY ANNOUNCES SATCONNECT SERVICEIBM has finally announced the official existence ofits IN Satconnect service in Europe, much to thechagrin of the other satellite network operators whoare keeping a somewhat discrete silence over thewhole affair.After many months of waiting and broken internaldeadlines, IBM executives have allowed news of thenew service to become officially released.  Manysoftware revisions and internal quality assurancecertifications contributed towards the internaldelays.  Many observers who have seen the systembelieve that the IBM-induced delays were worthwhile.The system has been announced in Austria, Belgium,Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,Switzerland and the UK.Data transmission rates of 9.6kbit/s to 2mbit/s canbe attained through the new 'digital pipe'.  The"general availability" date is slated for 30September 1993.  Countries will be free to set theirown dates.Typically IBM expects one bit in two billion (10 tothe power of 10) to be corrupted at the downlink.Error correction significantly reduces thisoccupance.IN SatConnect is designed to be operatedindependently of other telecommunications networks,although it can be linked with the existing IBMInformation Network services like the IBM InformationExchange EDI service to collect data. With thesystem, the information provider will link into IBM'snetwork to transmit data for distribution. Receivesites will use conventional VSAT hardware combinedwith IBM PCs and custom-designed hardware. VSATreceivers as small as 80cm can be used in the centreof the Eutelsat satellite's footprint.Signal security is a key feature of IN SatConnect,and advanced data masking technology has beenincluded to provide integrity for transmitted data.As the system is digitally-based, video, audio anddata can be merged and transmitted securely.Data can be scheduled so that it is broadcast at aset time even though it has been loaded by theinformation provider onto the transmission system inadvance. Real time data throughput will be supportedon the system during 1994 once a second release ofsoftware is made during December 1993.  IBM ispresently attempting to attract "batch broadcasters"who wish to send large files to multiple locationsrather than the continuous small-file feed companies.Real time feeds are considered an important businessarea and they will be approached once a steady streamof customers has been found.The information provider is charged for connection tothe SatConnect service. There is an initial charge ofGBP3,552 and an annual charge of GBP13,331 for thetransfer of 500 megabytes of data.  Further use ischarged according to a tariff.  Receive sites costGBP1,068 initially with a GBP720 annual chargethereafter.  Under the existing IBM discount scheme,existing IN users can achieve discounts up to 40percent of standard tariff guides, bringing the costsdown significantly in the process.IBM has signed an agreement with Comstream Corp. tomarket and distribute its satellite receiverequipment.  Although IBM is not making the use ofComstream equipment mandatory, thus allowing thepotential use of plug-compatible equipment, Comstreamequipment will be marketed as a "complimentary non-IBM product" and will feature in all promotional andsales literature.The Comstream DBR401 multi-function satellitebroadcast receiver and LNB are provided under themarketing agreement.One feature of the IBM network is that bandwidth canbe changed "over the air" in accordance with users'needs.  The DBR401 receiver will have four pre-selected data rates programmed as standard reducingthe requirement for field maintenance.Data sent to the receiving PS/2 computer canimmediately be routed to a LAN server or mainframe ifrequired, thus freeing local receiver resources andpermitting the prompt processing of data.* Minimum system requirements for the PS/2 receiverare: MCA-based bus; 20MHz clock speed; 8MB RAM; slotfor IN card; RS-232 port; OS/2 version 1.3 standardedition or OS/2 version 2.0Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA BROADCASTING NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 14, 1993FIRST UNION EXPANDS DATA NETWORKFirst Union Corporation, a Charlotte, NJ, USA-basedcommercial company has extended its contract with GTESpacenet to continue the provision of a Skystar VSATnetwork.

OF COMMERCEAfter being asked "What is a VSAT?" by the USDepartment of Commerce as part of an investigationinto alleged trading misdemeanours, SatelliteTechnology Management is holding consultations toresolve technical questions raised over theexportability of a STM designed and builttelecommunications system in Iran.The Department of Commerce has classified a VSATsystem to be a commercial communications networkeligible for export to Iran without prior USgovernment approval, but the Commerce Department hasinvestigated recent shipments made by STN to Iran,and agents raided offices seizing papers (DBNpassim).STM points out that Iran currently has two US-builtVSAT systems in operation, with the largest networkprovided by Hughes Network Systems for theTelecommunications Company of Iran.  STM has suppliedthe second, smaller network to the Iranian nationalbroadcasting organisation to demonstrate VSATapplications to commercial entities such as theCentral Bank of Iran.Following on from the demonstration, STM is nowbattling against AT&T, GTE and Hughes to win thelucrative contract conservatively valued at US$15million.A VSAT system ordered in December 1992 by IranElectronic Industries (IEI) under a US$1.4 millioncontract is presently held at US docks after shipmentwas stopped by customs officials.  The system wasdestined for use within a shared hub using Intelsat-leased transponder segment.The problem now facing STM is to prove exactly what aVSAT is, and confirm to Department of Commerceofficials that there is nothing untoward about theshipment that could contravene US technology exportrestrictions.Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA BROADCASTING NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 14, 1993EURO VSAT MARKET SET TO RISE--REPORTCIT Research's annual Satellite Communications inEurope report for 1993 has just been released, and itforecasts that the total market for satellitebusiness services will be almost ECU1.2 billion by2002, with the facilities management of two-way VSATnetworks and services accounting for 24 percent ofrevenues.The rise in takeup for VSAT services will rise withthe market developing in many diverse ways.  VSATservices are likely to be used foremost in the UK,Germany and France -- countries noted for their'awareness' to VSAT operators' needs -- and by 2001there would be an estimated 19,000 one-way VSATterminals installed and around 15,000 two-way VSATterminals.   This number still pales intoinsignificance when compared to North America or theFar East.CIT says that during 1992, as in 1991, Germany wasthe largest market for VSAT services with thepresence of four network operators, and Italycontinues to be experiencing steady, firm growth. TheUK's market has consolidated following the sale ofBritish Aerospace Communications, and the often lacklustre performance of its own incumbent operators.Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA BROADCASTING NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 14, 1993HUGHES LAUNCH VOICE VSAT PRODUCT AT AT93Hughes Network Systems has launched a new VSATproduct designed to provide small, remote businesslocations with a high-grade data and voicecommunications service at a lower price thancomparable systems.

A discussion and proposal paperwas released to members of the UK academic communitylate in May.The system relies upon broadcasters manuallysynchronising the start of audio with the start of ateletext multipage sequence, such as a demonstrationor advertisement.  It could also be used to provideon-screen representation of a live event, such assports results or elections.  Using telescontextwould enable the user to access a lot moreinformation while listening to a continuous audiofeed.One of the key differences of Telescontext againststandard teletext is that the audio can be totallyseparate from the television broadcast.

In GermanyVSATs were popular after the reunification of Eastand West Germany, and were extensively employed by'West' German companies to link-up offices in the new'Eastern Lands.'Jon Collins, the outspoken and well-respectedmanaging director of AT&T Tridom Europe, pointed outthat there have been a lot of positive developmentsin the marketplace over the past five years, and thatdemand will continue to rise."The tremendous possibilities in central and EasternEurope are clear, and it is significant that inGermany new legislation specifically encouraged theuse of satellite networks to overcome the problems oflimited infrastructure."There will always be a place for terrestrialtelecommunications infrastructure, and companies suchas AT&T Tridom readily realise and accept this. "VSATis not going to replace all of a company's network.It will be driven by certain applications.  It needsto be case and cost-justified.  I am not forecastingexplosive growth [for VSAT], but I am genuinelyoptimistic that we have finally turned the corner inthe European VSAT market," said Collins.Chris Bell, head of Unisource Satellite Services(USS), formerly known as Vesatel, believes thatEastern European and CIS countries will act as animportant driver for new VSAT systems orders, eventhough the average 'terminals per network' ratio willbe lower.According to Bell, VSATs provide an ideal networkinfrastructure for establishing a full range oftelecommunications services in areas with poorlydeveloped or unreliable communications, such as thedeveloping countries in Central and Eastern Europe.But Europe has a long way to go before satellitenetworks are as  successful as those operated in theUnited States."A VSAT network can be installed within weeks and ata relatively low cost. Eastern Europe and CentralEurope are almost without exception faced with poortelecomms," said Bell.Many industry commentators have often noted thatsmaller VSAT networks are not economically viable,and at times network operators have failed tounderstand the economics of providing comparatively-smaller VSAT networks.In Western countries 150-300 terminal networks areoften the norm, but in areas with a poortelecommunications infrastructure, a 20-50 terminallocation or even a dedicated point-to-point satellitecommunications link can prove to be economicallyviable, especially where economic regeneration andexports are concerned.Delegates and speakers at the conference agreed thatfurther moves in deregulation were an essential andgood thing, and that greater emphasis should beplaced on integrated, pan-European network in thefuture.Back to Headline List CopyrightDATA BROADCASTING NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 14, 1993DBN DIARY9 JuneCable Telephony (conference)London, UKTel: +44 (0) 71 637 438310-15 June18th International Television Symposium & TechnicalExhibitionMontreaux, SwitzerlandTel: +41 21 963 32 2015 JuneSatellite services for Eastern EuropeLondon, UKTel: +44 71 240 187115-17 JUNEMultimedia 93London, UKTel: +44 81 742 282817-18 JuneSubscription Television 1993London, UKTel: +44 (0) 71 637 438322-23 JuneIntroduction to Satellite CommunicationsCambridge, UKTel: +44 (0) 440 6253424 JuneSatellite Voice ServicesCambridge, UKTel: +44 (0) 440 6253429-30 JuneSatellite Data ServicesCambridge, UKTel: +44 (0) 440 625341 JulySatellite Video Services for BusinessCambridge, UKTel: +44 (0) 440 625347-8 JulyMaritime Communications & ControlLondon, UKTel: +44 (0) 71 481 849318-23 JulySatellite Communications SystemsSurrey, UKTel: +44 71 240 187119-23 JulyNew Broadcast Standards & SystemsWarwick, UKTel: +44 71 240 187120-25 AugustTeleteaching '93 (including distance learning)Trondheim, NorwayTel: +47 7 54404027 August-5 SeptemberInternationale FunkausstellungBerlin, GermanyTel: +49 30 3038 014 SeptemberCable CommunicationsLondon, UKTel: +44 (0) 71 631 321416-20 SeptemberLive '93Olympia, London, UKTel: +44 (0) 71 782 600029-30 SeptemberUK Telecommunications PolicyLondon, UKTel: +44 (0) 71 631 32145-7 OctoberVision '93Olympia, London, UKTel: +44 (0) 71 830 844727-29 OctoberHome Satellite TV AsiaPhuket, ThailandTel: +1 305 767 468729-31 OctoberBroadcast India 93Bombay, IndiaTel: +91 22 215 139629-30 NovemberA Charter for Public Broadcasting (EBU)Brussels, BelgiumTel: +41 22 717 2111Companies are requested to fax information aboutforthcoming events to "DBN  Diary" on +44 203 717 418or through mail in good time to the DBN editorialoffice.

You know -- that house up theroad with just a few too manyturrets, the evening gown laden withsequins and rhinestones, or maybeit's that magazine you subscribe towith its garish color.Whether publishers feel they'regetting their money's worth or(sadly) whether they actually believethis reflects good design, manymagazines don't seem to know where todraw the line when it comes to color.Some publications have a naturalcurbing device -- budgets. Dependingon the arrangement you have with yourprinter, color costs typicallyparallel usage. And magazines thatkeep an eye on such excesses willnaturally tighten the purse stringson rampant color, forcing thedesigner to be more selective aboutits application.But, for those without such built-inconstraints, the need for criticalcolor sensibilities becomesparamount. Here are some simpleguidelines.Don't Let Spot Color Upstage FourColorWhen a magazine has the benefit ofglorious photography or top-notchillustration, designers should letthose elements be the stars.Frequently, the images will benefit that remain solid black. Trying totie in a color from the image ontothe larger type will likely cause thetype to compete with the image (orimages) for importance.If you need to give type moreimportance on the page, try otheroptions like making the type largeror designing it into a higherposition on the page. In some cases,making the type bolder will alsowork.Be Selective About Spot ColorIf you must use color in a layout,limit the application. Find a placeyou want the reader to go first, thenput that item in color. Instead ofdoing an entire headline in color,highlight just one key word. Thiswill also let readers determine thecontent of the story more quickly.Drop caps are another popularcandidate for color. When using them,you'll be more successful when theheadline is short and large. That waythe drop cap can still play asecondary role in the design eventhough it's in color.Sometimes the best use of spot coloris something as incidental as a bandor rule that will bring the reader'seye to the part of the page or spreadwhere you've placed important text,like a subhead or pull quote. Theimportant thing to remember is thatcolor will attract attention whenused sparingly. Be sure there'ssomething worth seeing when you drawthe reader to a point on the page.Use Solid Versions with TintsWhen tinting sidebars or screeninglarge type, it's wise to also use thetint color in full strength somewhereon the page. Tints alone can oftensmack of weak print quality, but whenthat color is also a solid, there'sno question about the intent of the This approach works well for sidebarsthat have a screen covering the boxwhile the border and headline areprinted in a solid. Another variationis to print the sidebar box as asolid color, then knock the type outof the solid. When doing this, goback into the headline and make it a10 or 20 percent tint of the box.It's best to limit this treatment toshort sidebars. No one will want toread a large mass of knock-out type.Avoid Critical RegistrationDon't expect too much from yourprinter. Printing small type or finerules is difficult to keep inregister. If you elect to print afine box rule in color, limit it toone of the base colors like magentaor cyan. Boxes are especiallydifficult because they require bothhorizontal and vertical registration.Likewise, typography -- even largetype -- will challenge the mostskilled printer when the final colorcalls for tint combinations to alignon especially thin diagonal strokesor delicate serifs.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITORS ONLY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996 . . .MORE. . .Use Appropriate ColorSome designers tend to select colorsin a void, ignoring the underlyingmessage certain colors (orcombinations) convey. Just as red andgreen will surely conjure up imagesof Christmas, other colors projectmoods and reflect attitudes. Wisedesigners will work this to theiradvantage, using blood red to inferterror or a cool blue to suggestwinter.More importantly, be careful that thecolor you've selected isn't sendingout an inappropriate signal to thereader. Businesslike subjects callfor reserved colors. If youreditorial content needs to be taken use serious colors when you want themessage to be playful.Using color effectively walks thereader through stories in much thesame way as images and type do -- thebig blast comes at the beginning ofthe story and gradually tapers off asit progresses. Color may, in fact,drop off to nothing by the end of thestory. This not only allows the nextnew feature to have more impact, butalso lets readers unwind as they movethrough a story.Smart designers will also use colorto unify the pages of a story orseveral stories as a section. Adistinctive color on each spread of astory will serve to unite them. Thisis even more effective when the colorappears similarly throughout thepages, such as in the type or band ofan overline that's in the sameposition on each spread, or as thetint color on all sidebars, or whenall pull quotes are the same color.On sections, bands that bleed in fromthe top of each page or color iconson the opener of each story can pullthe stories together.Use a Little Gray MatterFor magazines limited to black and asecond color, don't overlook thevalue of combining the color withgray tints. Adding a touch of gray toa tint of red will change it frompink to mauve. Gray working with ascreen of yellow can create a ratherunique and pleasing putty color --just right for a sidebar. Variouscombinations of gray and cyan canresult in rich, businesslike tones.Not only will this avoid the monotonyof repetitive color, it's also a wayto take the edge off raw, harshcolors.Avoid Flooding ColorPerhaps the biggest abuse of color is give them the appearance of coloredpaper stock. Rare is the situationthat warrants this treatment. Quitesimply, avoid it until you feelyou've mastered the craft ofdesigning with color.Color is the designer's best friendwhen used correctly. In the wronghands, however, it can be yourreaders' worst nightmare.John Johanek is a partner in thedesign firm of Ayers/JohanekPublication Design, 4750 RollingHills Drive, Bozeman, MT 59715; (406)585-8826; or, on the East Coast:Ayers/Johanek Publication Design,2003 31st St., SW, Allentown, PA18103; (610) 797-8253.

As newmedia grows, old media shrinks andadapts to a changing communicationsenvironment. --What is the future of print in theInformation Age? --How will it evolve to meet risingexpectations and changing demands? --Will batch printing be replaced bycustomized, on-demand xerography? --And what will happen to all thoseprofessionals who make their livingscrafting paper pages?Here are some thoughts on the statusof today's print media:New computing, communications andimaging technologies have automatedmost of the print productionbusiness. Word processing, desktoppublishing, computer graphics,electronic photography and digitalimaging have eliminated most prepressjobs. Laser-to-plate systems, digitalprinting presses, color laserprinters and in-line finishingequipment are pushing automation intothe pressroom and bindery. Publishersare living most of the productionmanager's dream of workflow "frombrain to mouse to press," and it'seasier than ever before to make moreprint.Nobody Wants More PrintExcept for the people who sell paperand ink, nobody in the developedworld wants more print, more"information" dumped on our desksevery morning that we never get achance to read, more magazines pilingup on the floor awaiting recyclingday, more catalogs that go directlyfrom the mail box to the trash.What we need -- what publishers arestriving to create -- is betterprint, more effective publication,and these days that might meanink-on-paper, toner-on-paper orpixels-on-screen. Instead of a singlepressrun of a million impressions,buyers are asking for ten pressrunsof a hundred-thousand each and manyare shooting for a hundred-thousandpressruns of ten impressions each.Printing Belongs to the IndustrialAgeConventional printing (along withbroadcast television) typifies thebatch manufacturing approach of theIndustrial Revolution: a singlestandardized product produced in vastquantities with terrific economies ofscale and constantly improvingprocess efficiencies. processing nirvana in which everycylinder of every press is churningout perfect pages 24 hours a day, 7days a week for a single customer, ahouse account, who pays -- everyFriday -- in cash. New technologieslike desktop publishing, imageprocessing and digital prepress havedramatically improved the efficiencyof batch printing and at the sametime made smaller batches moreaffordable.Interactive Media Belongs to theInformation AgeAdvances in computing, communicationsand imaging technologies improve thetargeting of publications. On thecreative side, electronic design andproduction tools make morecustomized, more timely and moreeconomical page forms. On thedistribution side, new media formatsmake the delivery of the publicationbetter, faster and cheaper. Smartpublishers in every industry segmentare crafting a new generation ofinteractive publications that tunethemselves uniquely to the needs ofthe "Audience of One." (Some printersare expanding into new mediaservices, some of which make money.)The Costs of Conventional Paper-basedPublishing are RisingPrint is getting more expensive andlosing its competitive edge toalternative media. --Paper costs are rising rapidly andmay never return to their historicallows since demand from the developingworld is increasing and pressure fromenvironmental groups opposed to papermills is strong worldwide. --Distribution costs (includingpostage) are based on constantlyincreasing labor and energy costs andwill never get any cheaper. --Out-of-date information costs,which don't show up on many publishers in all segments.The Expectations of Readers are alsoRisingNow that nearly every literate personhas used a computer, a revolution ofrising expectations is sweeping thepublishing markets. These newexpectations cover both the editorialand the commercial aspects ofpublication. --Readers expect faster turnaroundto compete with electronic media. --They prefer the searchability ofinteractive products to the deadweight of paper. --They like the superiorillustration opportunities ofmultimedia. --They expect to pay-per-view forthe information they need rather thansubscribe to pages they may neveruse.There are Three Kinds of Publishersand Three Kinds of Publications.Defined by their environments andtheir audiences, publishingoperations fall into three broadclasses: --Commercial publishers print forprofit and produce newspapers,magazines, books and other productswhich generally carry a price tag. --Corporate publishers create pagesfor advertising, marketing, corporatecommunications, technicaldocumentation and collateral materialthat they usually give away for free. --Government publishers in federal,state and local divisions generatemountains of legislative, regulatoryand judicial documents that are paidfor by our tax money.Defined by their intended use, mostpublications do predominantly one ofthree things, although most pagescontain all three in varying  --Inform readers with breaking news,analysis, reference data,specifications, prices and otherfacts. --Entertain audiences with stories,novels, poems, jokes, gossip andother forms of narrative. --Persuade prospects withadvertising spiels, marketingcommunications, sales notices andpromotional material.[Editors Note: What are yourreactions to Jack's characterizationof the status of print?

JacobiWe've addressed the subject ofdetail, the power thereof.We've also discussed the issue ofshow vs. tell: that to show means tobring the reader close to place orperson or situation.In each case, the writer is using theright information, concreteinformation, and attaching to it justthe right words in just the rightcombinations.It's writing that makes a reader stopin his tracks.It's writing that opens a world inher mind. sound in the world, it makes athousand echoes." That's what detailis, at least potentially: an originalsound. It's what showing does.You are ThereRobert Mads Anderson is, according tothe records, the first person to havemade a solo climb to the highestmountain on every continent.Recently, for USAir Magazine, headapted a chapter from his book,Summits: Climbing the Seven SummitsSolo, this particular chapter dealingwith a harrowing effort to reachAntarctica's highest peak."The ice was blue and crisp," hewrites, "my ice tools barelypenetrating the surface. The airtemperature, steady at 40 below zeroCelsius, froze my breath intocrystals that floated onto the ice.The air froze into the back of mythroat and seemed to be drippingicicles into my lungs."I'm there, or at least I can begin tounderstand what it's like.It reminded me of a very differentplace and situation, as described byJean Fritz, the children's bookwriter, in her autobiography. "Whowould know by looking at a map whatthe Yangtse River really was?" sheasks. And then she answers:"Orange-brown, muddy mustard-colored.And wide, wide, wide. With a riversmell that was old and came all theway up from the bottom. Sometimes oldwomen knelt on the riverbank, beggingthe River God to return a son orgrandson who may have drowned. Theywould wail and beat the earth to makethe River God pay attention, but Iknew how busy the River God must be.All those people on the YangtseRiver! Coolies hauling water. Womenwashing clothes. Houseboats swarmingwith old people and young, chickens they could see where they were going.I loved the Yangtse River, but, ofcourse, I belonged on the other sideof the world. In America with mygrandmother."'Twenty-five fluffy little yellowchicks hatched from our eggs today,'my grandmother wrote."I wrote my grandmother that I hadwatched a Chinese magician swallowthree yards of fire."I'm there, or at least I can begin tounderstand what it's like.As in the case with Susan Orlean whenshe writes for The New Yorker: "Thepeople who shop at Sunshine Market, agrocery store in Jackson Heights,Queens, are thin and beautiful. Theyare also fat and plain, relaxed andfrantic, Colombian, Italian, Jewish,Indian, African-American, Bolivian,Uruguayan, Vietnamese, young, middle-aged, elderly, rowdy, meek, cheerful,world-weary, rich and broke. They buyhealth food. They buy Ding Dongs andDiet Coke. They have just come toAmerica. They have lived in America,in Jackson Heights, in the sameapartment, with the same furniture inthe same arrangement, for sixtyyears. They are in a big hurry. Theyare in no rush and hoping to bumpinto their neighbors for a chat. Theyare in minks. They are in theirpajamas, wearing stacks of haircurlers and no makeup. They arebuying the works for a dinner party.They are buying a Lean CuisineChicken Fettucini to eat alone." Andso forth.Yes, I'm there, or at least I canbegin to understand what it's like.These writers are doing their job.They are linking a reader to theirown experiences.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITORS ONLY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996 . . .MORE. . .James Kilpatrick, that always lucidcommentator on writing, has said: "Wemust look intently, and hearintently, and taste intently. . .wemust look at everything very hard. Isit the task at hand to describe asnowfall? Very well. We begin byobserving that the snow is white. Isit as white as bond paper? White aswhipped cream? Is the snow daisywhite, or egg-white, or whitewashwhite? Let us look very hard. We willsee that snow comes in differenttextures. The light snow that lookslike powdered sugar is not the heavysnow that clings like wet cotton.When we write matter-of-factly thatlast night it snowed and this morningthe fields were white, we have notlooked intently."Such intensity comes from a curiousand gripping direction in a passagewritten by Brenda Miller, this for anessay in The Georgia Review. "I havenever been touched by someone blind,"she writes, "but I can imagine whatit would be like. She would read melike Braille, her fingertips hoveringon the raised points of my flesh,then peel back the sheets of my skin,lay one finger on my quivering heart.We could beat like that, twohummingbirds, and become very still.Her hands might move across myabdomen, flick the scar below mybelly button. My eyelids wouldflutter at her touch, and my skindissolve into hot streams of tears."Richard Rhodes in How to Write speaksof writing as "a craft that cutswindows through the terrifyingopacity of the world." BrendaMiller's words do that.So does David Stout when, for The NewYork Times, he expresses a complexfeeling this way: "So much has beenwritten about the joy of hunting andso little about the sadness, thesadness that fills the silence after hunting. "I was not squeamish, say,about slitting the belly of a freshlykilled rabbit and dumping thesteaming guts onto the damp leaves ona chill November day. But I cannotforget the day when I was 13 and shotat a big rusty fox squirrel threetimes before it came tumbling downfrom the trees, bounding off limbs asit fell, then trying to crawl away."And this hunter who would not remaina hunter grabbed the animal by itstail, dragging it to a clearing tofinish it off with the gun butt. Thenhe stood still in the dusk, listeningto a chain saw in the distance andwaiting for his sadness to go away.He has been waiting for 40 years."Intense. Penetrating. I am at one.I'd be at one even if I feltdifferently about such activity.I return to the word "understanding."Stout makes me understand.As does Neil de Grasse Tyson in avery different way. His recentarticle, "When Galaxies Collide," forNatural History, warns of suchuniversal events. They're happeningeven as I write, even as you read.Horrors. Fears. But then he tells me:"During the cosmic acrobatics,individual stars easily pass by eachother through interstellar spacebecause galaxies are mostly empty, inspite of how packed they look. Forexample, if there were just foursnails running loose in thecontinental United States for abillion years, then two of them wouldbe more likely to accidentally bumpinto each other than would two starsduring a galactic collision."I can breathe easier.Give-my-all WritingMuch closer to home, George Dismukes,an independent filmmaker, reflects on"What it's like to live in prison,"for Newsweek. "At day's end we werereturned to our night cells," hesays. "Night is when the morons andneurotics holler and shake theirbars, when the fanatics cry outentreaties to their God. One canshout obscenities at the neighborswith impunity. Those who would liketo sleep are not permitted to haveearplugs."The jail," he continues, "alsooffers the pleasures of solitaryconfinement. That's where I am rightnow, in lockdown. One day they cameand brought me here, withoutexplanation. After the bedlam ofwhere I had been, the quiet was ablessing, for I like to read andexercise my mind by filling yellowlegal pads with introspection. That'sme; solitary is tougher on those withlittle education or sense ofcontemplation. On the wall of my cellare graffiti left by formerresidents. One welcomes the newcomerto hell, others speak of the horrorsof aloneness. I realize how fortunateI am that for me silence holds noterror."This is give-my-all writing.It is what Annie Dillard calls for inThe Writing Life when she says: "Oneof the few things I know aboutwriting is this: spend it all, shootit, play it, lose it, all, rightaway, every time. . . .The impulse tosave something good for a betterplace later is the signal to spend itnow.

Instead,editors take a technical-productoriented tack with their editorial."Research over the years showsreaders are less interested in thearcane points of procurement thanthey are in the computers," saysTemin. --Keep readers apprised of whattheir colleagues are doing.Government employees want to know howtheir associates are doing in theirown agencies, says Temin. --Run product reviews. "We were thefirst, and until this year, the onlygovernment publication to have itsown product test facility and to runevery-issue product reviews," saysTemin. --Always take the government user'spoint-of-view. "We're very parochialabout covering the government,"remarks Temin. "Even when we doproduct coverage -- the same producteverybody's covering -- we don'tcover it unless there's a governmentangle to it."  --Patricia Donohue,assistant editor.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDITORS ONLY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996Get Authors' Permission for ReprintsWhether Electronic or PrintUnderstanding reprint rights undercurrent copyright law.By Ellen M. KozakA magazine establishes a Web site onthe Internet to familiarize morepeople with the magazine, create afavorable impression of it, andhopefully increase readership. Eachmonth they put up a copy of the tableof contents for people to browse and,in addition, the editors select thebest article in the issue and put iton the Web site, as well. What'swrong with this picture?Another editor is about to publish anarticle about the transportationstrikes in Paris. In the article, theauthor mentions Jacques Chirac. Theeditor adds an editor's note that themagazine published an article on theFrench president last year, andinvites readers to get a copy bysending an s.a.s.e. Is thatpermissible?A Matter of Copyright/ContractBoth of the examples above boil downto reprints -- one in print, and theother electronic. Whether a magazinehas the right to issue either kind ofreprint is a matter of copyright andcontract; both kinds of reprint areconsidered publication under the law.Although electronic rights areturning out to be a hot area forcopyright lawyers, the answers tosome of the questions that occur seemfairly clear under current copyrightlaw. Others, however, are less so --and may become more complicated ascustomary author/publisher agreementsevolve to meet the needs of newtechnology.Writer's Status Determines WritesWhat rights a publisher has inrelation to a contributor depend onthe status of the writer. Is thepiece written by a staffer as part ofhis or her job? If so, it is legallyclassified as a work made for hire,and you, as publisher, own all therights and can publish or distributeit as you choose.But pieces written outside the scopeof employment -- for example, ahumorous column written by your copyeditor -- like pieces contributed byfreelancers, are works in which allrights (including reprint andelectronic rights) originate andremain with the author.Exceptions to RuleThere are three exceptions to therule that the creator of the workretains the full copyright. The firstexception is for works made for hire.To fall into this category, anarticle, sketch or photo (all threeare copyrightable) must (1) bespecially ordered and commissioned,(2) fit into one of nine classes (oneof which is collective works such asnewspapers and magazines), and (3) besubject to an agreement in writingsigned by both parties stating thatthe work is and was always intendedto be made for hire.The second exception requires anassignment of rights. An author canassign all or any portion of therights that make up the copyright ina work but the law requires copyrightassignments to be in writing.Special Provision in LawBoth of these exceptions obviouslyrequire a contract. If you are notusing a contract with yourcontributors, there is a third waythat you acquire at least somerights. The drafters of the currentU.S. copyright law understood thatmany newspapers and magazines do nothabitually use contracts, so theybuilt in a special section of the lawto address the rights of authors intheir contributions to collectiveworks. It reads as follows:"Copyright in each separatecontribution to a collective work isdistinct from copyright in thecollective work as a whole, and vestsinitially in the author of thecontribution. In the absence of anexpress transfer of the copyright orof any rights under it, the owner ofcopyright in the collective work ispresumed to have acquired only theprivilege of reproducing anddistributing the contribution as partof that particular collective work,any revision of that collective work,and any later collective work in thesame series."Ambiguity in Section of LawThe first sentence of this section ofthe law is pretty clear: copyright --the right to reproduce a work,distribute it, display it, performit, and create derivative works basedon it -- initially belongs to thecreator of the work.However, the second sentence,although it's construction seems toimply a restrictive reading("acquired only the privilegeof . . ."), does contain a certainamount of ambiguity. Just whatconstitutes a revision of acollective work or a later collectivework in the same series? Could eitherof these conceivably include anelectronic version?Get Written AgreementUntil Congress or the courts clarifythis, your best way of making sureyou have acquired the rights you wantis a written agreement. Bear in mindthat supplying reprints, either inhard copy or on-line -- orauthorizing others, such as UnCoverto do so, may well constitute aninfringement of the author'scopyright. If doing these things isimportant to you, get the permissionin writing.Bear in mind, however, that acquiringthese rights may mean you have to paythe author a higher fee, or aroyalty, or an annual license fee.Writers survive economically byreselling articles to non-competingmarkets. The availability of anarticle out on the Web cuts down onits value to other publications.As for the answers to the questionsat the beginning of this piece -- ifthe articles are not works made forhire or if you haven't obtained allrights to them, your best course ofaction is to obtain the writer'swritten permission to distribute orelectronically display the articles.Putting it into your contract is yourbest way to preserve good relationswith a contributor and avoid thepossibility of copyrightinfringement.Ellen M.

Field Corp. had putField Publications on the block in July and recently confirmed thatit was involved in talks with K-III on sale of the company (EM,Dec. 10, `90). Its investment banker for the transaction is MorganStanley.The sale, which is expected to be completed early this year, involvesField's classroom periodicals, including Weekly Reader; book clubs;supplementary materials for children; and its Funk & Wagnallsencyclopedia and educational materials publishing unit, acquired inmid-1988 (EM, June 6, `88). These businesses, which employ about 950people, have estimated combined sales of more than $300 million. Withthe acquisition, K-III, a publishing-oriented investment partnership,will operate seven publishing and information businesses with 2000employees and post yearly sales of about $500 million.According to William F. Reilly, chairman and CEO of K-III, theacquisition provides a strategic fit with K-III's educational unit,Newbridge Communications, a direct marketing company specializingin books clubs and continuity programs for teachers and children.Newbridge markets to more than 400,000 teachers, and Field's WeeklyReader and ancillary publications go to more than 8.5 millionelementary students and 700,000 teachers.

For the entire publishingindustry, The Outlook showed shipments totalling $14.5 billion in1990, a 6.7% increase over 1989. When adjusted for inflation, theCommerce Department data showed shipments up 2.5% in the year.A slowing economy which featured minimal growth in personalconsumption expenditures was cited as a leading reason for themodest sales growth in the year, which fell below CommerceDepartment estimates of real growth of 3.6%. Restrained school andlibrary funding were also named as reasons for the lower thanexpected growth.The Commerce Department also estimated that publishers' profitswere hurt in 1990. While publishers achieved limited economiesthrough improvements in manufacturing and distribution operations,these savings were reduced by higher editorial, marketing andadministrative costs, the report said.Despite a soft economy, the Commerce Department's outlook for 1991sees publishers benefitting from a more coherent funding patternfor textbooks, nominal gains in disposable income and fromcontinued demand for books in the international marketplace. On thenegative side, postal rate increases and higher costs for paperwill put pressure on margins. Commerce sees rising schoolenrollment and gains in education funding pushing U.S. bookindustry sales to $17.3 billion this year, an increase--adjustedfor price increases--of about 3% from 1990.For the longer term, Commerce forecasts real growth of about 3.5%.Growth will be accompanied by moderate cost increases as papermills and book printers become more efficient in the manufactureand printability of recycled and acid-free paper. El-hi enrollmentsare projected to rise by 3 million students in the 1990-95 period,while 10.2 million people are expected to move into the highincome, heavy reading segment, aged 35 to 54 during this span.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDUCATIONAL MARKETER via NewsNetJanuary 7, 1991Education Publishing Stocks Drop 26.2% In 1990Stock prices of education publishers fell by 26.2% last year,compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which declined by4.4%, according to a round-up of publicly held companies. Allpublishers posted declines, and those of all but one, McGraw-Hill,showed declines in the double-digit category. M-H's stock pricedropped by 7.3% to 52 5/8, compared with 56 3/4 at the end of 1989.Hardest hit was Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, down by 80.2% to 15/16from 4 3/4 a year ago. Wall Street is evidently not convinced thatthe beleagured company will successfully complete a turnaround. Itwas followed by John Wiley, which recorded a drop of 43.4% to 30,compared with 53 at the end of 1989. Investor Theodore Cross'recent low key stance regarding Wiley has dampened speculation thatWiley may soon be put in play.Waverly similarly recorded a hefty drop of 30% to 17 1/4 from 241/2 at the close of 1989, also a victim of diminished speculation.Following in descending order are Times Mirror, down 25.2% from 353/4 to 26 3/4 at the end of 1990; Plenum, down 20.2% from 28 1/2 to22 3/4; Houghton Mifflin, down 19.8% from 38 7/8 to 24 3/4; andParamount, down 19% from 50 1/2 to 40 7/8.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDUCATIONAL MARKETER via NewsNetJanuary 7, 1991Houghton Mifflin Hopes For Better Growth in `91Acknowledging that it has failed to achieve its minimum financialgoals of 10% compounded growth in sales and net income for the pastfew years--including 1990--Houghton Mifflin said it is hopeful itwill reach that target in 1991. Results in 1990 were hurt by a 20%increase in developmental costs as well as lower than expectedcollege revenues.Speaking at PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference, HMchief financial officer Stephen Jaeger said both HM's trade &reference division and school division are expected to show stronggrowth in 1991. The school division in particular is expected tobenefit from a host of new developments undertaken in 1990,including the development of an elementary social studies programthat will be introduced this year. El-hi social studies is a newsegment for HM.Company margins should benefit from more modest increases indevelopmental costs, Jaeger said. Improvements in technology havebeen a two-edged sword when it comes to margins, he reported. Whiletechnology has improved publishing efficiency, it has also placedpressure on marketing and selling costs by causing schools toexpect lots of extras when selling texts.HM chairman Nader Darehshori also touched on the ancillarymaterials issue, observing that the biggest change in marketing hehas seen over the years is the amount of freebies schools have cometo expect. He claimed that HM has one of the smallestimplementation packages in the industry and said the company has noplans to expand that kit. He added that some competitors couldbecome so desperate for short term gains that they might increasethe size of the incentive package.Darehshori also said that HM will continue to increase itsattention on the high school market in order to meet risingenrollments. During 1990, HM introduced a new English program forgrades 9-12 as well as new editions of its math program. A newAmerican history textbook is also set for this year.Adoption opportunities for reading this year are expected to bebroader, and H-M has just started intoducing a new 1991 readingprogram called Houghton Mifflin Reading: The Literature Experience,Dareshori said. He noted that early responses from the market havebeen positive, with the program already having been adopted inGeorgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico and Oklahoma.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDUCATIONAL MARKETER via NewsNetJanuary 7, 1991No Fire Sale At Maxwell Communication Corp.Though its debt still stands at 1.7 billion pounds, Maxwell CommunicationCorp.s' joint managing director Kevin Maxwell told analysts atPaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference that MCC is not ina fire sale position and will not sell any more operations unlessit can get a full and fair price.MCC executives sought to put distance between their company andadvertising-dependent companies that have been battered by a slumpin advertising by noting that only 10% of its business relies onadvertising revenue. MCC's businesses also do not rely on theeconomic fortune of one nation, executives said. Although about 80%of MCC's business is headquartered in the U.S., more than 30% ofrevenue from those businesses are derived from offshore.MCC was more forthcoming than McGraw-Hill about its hopes fortaking take its Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. public,saying it hopes to take the venture public by the third quarter of1991 subject to market conditions. In an earlier presentation, M-Hchairman Joseph Dionne was vague about prospects for taking theschool publisher public. According to the agreement, however,either party can offer all or some of their own shares in anoffering. MCC seems more eager to take the publisher public thanM-H.Minority offerings in other MCC companies such as OAG and PergamonPress will not be considered until after the offering for M-M-H,Maxwell said. Those sales will also depend on market conditions.Maxwell also indicated that all sales would not be solely to raisemoney. The recent sale of 20% of Berlitz to a Japanese privateeducation company to form Berlitz Japan (EM, Nov. 19 `90) helps thecompany to tap Japanese students to buy our products, Maxwell said.Berlitz provides language instruction and translation services.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDUCATIONAL MARKETER via NewsNetJanuary 7, 1991New M-M-H Activity SeriesThe Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. has released twonew series of activity books aimed at boosting parental involvementin elementary mathematics and science education.

Book publishing and cable operationshave been the company's strongest performers in the year, he said.As part of efforts to cut costs in the year, TM plans in 1991 toreduce capital spending to less than $300 million and has setstringent limits on acquisitions.In the company's professional publishing group, Erburu said thatMatthew Bender and Jeppensen Sanderson finish 1990 withdouble-digit gains in both revenues and operating profits.

In addition, Aurand told the analysts that Bantawould consider making an acquisition primarily in twoareas--hardcover books and soft cover manuals.Banta's commitment notwithstanding, Aurand said growth in theproduction of paperback books for education should be slower in1991 than in `90. Aurand was hopeful, however, that business in thegeneral book area would remain strong and he was particularlyoptimistic about the prospect for soft cover manuals. The growth ofthe computer industry continues to feed the growth of the computermanuals business, Aurand noted.Aurand and Henseler were optimistic that Banta will hit itstargeted goals of a 9% growth in revenues and a 13% increase inprofits in 1990. Aurand said Banta was cautiously optimistic about1991, noting that he is confident revenues will be there, but addedthat margins are a concern.The executives also said that the negotiations for the sale ofBanta Ventures, Banta's video production unit, are continuing withthe management of that operation. Banta said in October it wasplanning to divest itself of the video segment to focus on its corebusinesses of printing and graphics, a sentiment Aurand reiterated.And while Aurand acknowledged this is not the easiest time formanagement to get money, he said he was still confident a deal withBanta Ventures management will be completed.Back to Headline List CopyrightEDUCATIONAL MARKETER via NewsNetJanuary 7, 1991Scholastic's U.K. Unit To Acquire Deutsch Children's BooksScholastic Inc.'s U.K. subsidiary, Scholastic Publications Ltd.,has entered an agreement to acquire Andre Deutsch Children's Books,the children's hardcover publishing unit of Andre Deutsch Ltd.

For example, The Star Tribune Online (STO) announced that itwould upgrade its World Wide Web presence.  A STO/Web edition is scheduled forrelease in February.  STO is a unit of Cowles Media Company.  SIMBAInformation Inc., publisher of this newsletter, is an affiliate of Cowles.Gartner Group announced its Web publishing strategy this week (see relatedstory).ZD Net, an electronic warehouse of computer product and industry news,announced its Web site earlier this year.  Digital Ink and Journal RegisterCompany have yet to state their Web publishing initiatives.Europe Online, which licensed AT&T Interchange last year, abandoned the onlineplatform earlier this year in favor of the Web (EIR, Nov.  17, 1995).Interchangeable PartsKolowich said that "there is a tremendous amount of reusable[AT&T Interchange]components that are applicable to Web use, such as software code and tools."Where it's appropriate, "some AT&T Interchange publishing partners willcontinue to provide their content on BizNet," Kolowich said.  Pieces of AT&TInterchange's publishing partners content are already available on BizNet.AT&T New Media Services expects to redeploy its AT&T Interchange developmentstaff.  AT&T New Media Services has 300 employees.  "None of those 300employees are part of AT&T's severance package," Kolowich said.  AT&T iscutting 40,000 jobs over the next three years (see related story).AT&T Abandons All Online Systems For WebAT&T is following in the footsteps of many other online services and contentproviders and abandoning its other proprietary online systems o ImagiNationNetwork, an online games service and PersonaLink, an e-mail service o and willremodel these services based on World Wide Web standards.AT&T said that a small portion of a $4 billion after-tax restructuring chargeagainst fourth quarter earnings would cover its online products being writtenoff or revalued.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC INFORMATION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996Web Version Of AT&T BizNet By Mid-96A World Web Web version of AT&T Business Network (BizNet), a newly launchedonline service, will debut by mid-1996, said Michael Kolowich, AT&T New MediaServices president.  The company will phase out the online version of theservice.  BizNet, which launched this fall, is an online information servicefor business professionals (EIR, Sept.  22, 1995).BizNet, which has in excess of 10,000 registered users, is "growing rapidly,"Kolowich said.

SIMBA is the publisher of BIM and this newsletter.Business information growth rates have risen steadily over the last few years,from 2.9% in 1991 to 5.1% in 1992 and 5.6% in 1993.  Business informationrevenues reached $25.4 billion in 1994, a 9.5% increase from $23.1 billion in1993.  Revenues are projected to exceed $27 billion in 1995.BIM defines business information as any copyrighted or proprietary informationproduced for a business or professional audience.  The research reportconcentrates on 10 business publishing markets and media, including onlinedatabases, print databases, trade magazines and newspapers, face-to-face andaudiovisual services, general business periodicals, research services andreports, looseleafs, newsletters, CD ROM databases and business books.Largest Segment By Format - Still PrintAs it has in past years, print remains the largest business informationsegment by format, with sales of $13.7 billion in 1994.  However, print'smarket share continued to slip from 57.0% in 1993 to 54.3% in 1994.Electronic services accounted for 37% of the business information market in1994, according to BIM.  Sales of electronic services were $9.3 billion in1994.  By 1999, SIMBA estimates that online services will account for close to50% of business information revenues.The remainder of the market consists of face-to-face and audiovisualinformation services, which had revenues of more than $2.2 billion.Face-to-face and AV accounted for 8.8% of the market in 1994, down from 9.1%in 1993.Database Revenues $13.8B In '94Database publishing continues to be the largest business information segment,with revenues of $13.8 billion in 1994.  Comparatively, database publishingrevenues were $12.1 billion in 1993.  BIM defines databases as any collectionof information from archival literature and text documents to real-timefinancial services and market quotes to directories and fax updates.Challenges AheadThere are several obstacles ahead for business publishers, including theuncertainty of advertising revenues, demand for wider distribution of data,industry consolidation and increased market competition.For more information on BIM, contact Daniel Kane at 203-834-0033 x171.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC INFORMATION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996Reuters '95 Sales To Fall Shy Of Record '94 LevelsReuters' 1995 sales growth will reach into the double digits, but will notequal last year's record-breaking 23% growth, according to Reuters chiefexecutive officer Peter Job.  "Expect gentle reduction in this growthrate...due to record sales back in mid-1994, when the market was very hot,"Job told analysts at the Paine Webber Outlook For Media conference last month.Reuters' sales are currently in a deceleration mode.  Job hinted thatfull-year results will likely be less than the 17% growth posted for the firstnine months of 1995.  An annual growth rate of 15%-17% would bring Reuters'1995 sales to between $4.14 billion and $4.21 billion.Job described Reuters' 1996 revenue outlook as good, but said the company isnot assured of double-digit gains because of continuing consolidation in theU.S.  financial market.  Reuters already has in place initiatives to reduce1996 operating costs, in case the growth slowdown continues."Broadly, we feel we will have a reasonable set of financials for next year,"he summarized.Despite that forecast, Reuters continues to dominate the financial informationbusiness.  Reuters' share of the $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion market has risenfrom one-third to two-thirds, Job maintained.  Reuters generates 90% of itsrevenue from information products, where it competes with Dow Jones Telerate,Bloomberg and Knight-Ridder Financial.  Transaction products represent thecompany's second-highest revenue generator.  Media products represent just sixpercent of revenues.International Expansion TargetedIn the next three to five years, Reuters will direct its growth efforts toemerging financial markets such as Russia, China and especially Japan.Reuters presently distributes financial information to 154 countries.  Onlyone-third of these countries are mature markets, while the other two-thirdsrepresent growing or emerging markets with vast potential, Job explained.To illustrate the growth opportunities in emerging markets, Job noted that theaverage site in such markets has only two to three user accesses, whiledeveloped countries average 10 accesses per site.  In Russia, for example,Reuters seldom sees a competitor, and already enjoys "reasonable market share"in China, Job noted.New Business Information/Transaction ProductsReuters will also look to develop new business information/transactionproducts for niche professional markets, like insurance and advertising andmarketing, where demand will come from managers who don't have access to theircompetitors' financial statistics.Specifically, Job pinpointed the insurance industry as a niche Reuters hopesto target.  he also reaffirmed the company's commitment to providinginformation for the advertising and media industry.  Reuters already owns a20% stake in AdValue Media Technologies (EIR, Dec.  10, 1993).  "Contribution[from niche professional markets] to sales growth, in my opinion, will quiterapidly become material," Job said.Back to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC INFORMATION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996McGraw-Hill Companies More Innovative In '96, Dionne SaysExpect to see more innovation from The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1996, JoeDionne, MHC chairman and chief executive officer, told analysts at the PaineWebber Outlook For Media conference last month."In the midst of all the talk of the software revolution and the informationsuperhighway, we believe that companies with content have a bright futureindeed," Dionne said.  The company believes that its breadth of content givesit a distinct competitive advantage in the development of new electronicservices for businesses and consumers.One year ago, MHC had not yet stated its Internet strategy (EIR, Jan.  6,1995).  MHC has been cautious and slow to move to the World Wide Web.New Electronic ProductsSo what's ahead for MHC in 1996?  The company is prepared to provide itscustomers "with the information they want, in the form and frequency theydesire," Dionne said.MHC will also enter the consumer market for the first time in 1996 with itsnewly formed Home Interactive Division.  The company provided sparse details,but expects to release its first group of electronic products for the 1996holiday selling season, said Terry McGraw, MHC president and chief operatingofficer.  In the corporate market, MHC is planning to create electronicextensions of its existing product lines, especially World Wide Web services,McGraw said.1996 Will Be ChallengingWhile 1995 was a good year, Dionne said that 1996 "will be a more challengingyear," especially in the school sales area.  Despite these challenges, thecompany expects "another year of double-digit increases," he said.Financial services, which was an important part of MHC's growth in 1995, isthe company's fastest growing global business, said McGraw.  In particular,MHC's Financial Services should see growth in the Far East.  Althoughtransaction volumes have been declining, sales increases are predicted in 1996for Standard & Poor's Debt Ratings.The company continues to develop new financial services products, including abroader portfolio of risk evaluation products.  MHC launched its Bank LoansRatings products in June 1995 and is already generating new revenues from thisproduct, McGraw said.  "The rebound continues at MHC's DRI unit," whichperforms econometric forecasting, according to McGraw.  He expects anotheryear of "progress and profitability."Shepard's Faces A Tough YearWithin Educational and Professional Publishing, the company's largest revenuegenerator, is Shepard's legal publishing unit.  Shepard's had a solid year in1995 due to the release of its federal citator revision system, McGraw said.However, Shepard's "faces a tough year in 1996," due to the planned sale ofthe company's topical business, which will lop off $22 million in sales.There won't be a new release of the popular citator revision system, he added.Information and Media Services, which contains all of MHC's advertising-basedbusinesses, reversed four straight years of declining margins, McGraw said.The company aims to improve margins again in 1996.  Business Week, thecompany's largest ad revenue producer, also had an outstanding year.Construction Information Better In '96In 1995, there were "some signs of life" in the construction informationbusiness, as the company continued to reshape this business (EIR, Jan.  6,1995), McGraw said.  In the first 10 months of 1995, the construction industrywas up 1.0% from one year ago, he added.Back to Headline List WT03-B10-10IA087-000629-B023-276http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/pb53.html 205.156.212.5 19970122040823 text/html 38018HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:06:29 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:21 GMTContent-length: 37831Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/pb53.html Sample Issue Copyright EUROPEAN MEDIA BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES EUROPEAN TV PRODUCTION TO GET FINANCIAL BOOST More channels mean more content opportunities (734 words) COMPANIES TO WATCH IN 1996: (92 words) PREDICTIONS: (35 words) SEX SELLS: EUROPEAN MARKET READIES FOR ADULT-ORIENTED ONSLAUGHT But don't look for X-rated material to stick around for long (720 words) SIDEBAR (117 words) NEWS IN BRIEF BSKYB BEING INVESTIGATED (177 words) NEW BIDDERS FOR PREMIER LEAGUE (141 words) KIRCH AND MMBG COME TOGETHER OVER MEDIABOX (222 words) OVUM ISSUES FINAL UPDATE ON ITV (198 words) NEW MEDIA: DISTRIBUTING FOREIGN-LANGUAGE PRODUCTS U.S. SOFTWARE COMPANIES LOOK TO GET LOCAL IN EUROPE Developers invest in localizing their products (603 words) SHOW NEWS PHILIPS PREPARES TO DEBUT DVD PLAYER IN ASIA Company demonstrates prototype at MIP Asia (611 words) CALENDAR: FILM FESTIVALS IN EUROPE (546 words) DATA PAGE: CZECH REPUBLIC (166 words) NEW MARKETS: IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS INTERACTIVE SERVICES CAUSE MILE-HIGH HEADACHES 1995 was the year of the bug; will 1996 be the year it hits big? (657 words) CopyrightEUROPEAN MEDIA BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EUROPEAN TV PRODUCTION TO GET FINANCIAL BOOSTMore channels mean more content opportunities     Increased channel capacity will lead to increased revenueopportunities for European television production companies in 1996.     "There are so many channels that you can't go on showing Americanreruns forever," said Nicholas Littlewood, managing director ofLondon-based Communications Equity Associates International Ltd. "There is a thirst for new product, and we will see a number of newtelevision production finance companies coming into existence,certainly in the U.K."      This does not necessarily mean the market will expand forHollywood-produced content.  Most European governments have beentrying to move away from Hollywood influences, opting to fund home-grown projects instead:     * Recently, the European Commission proposed a $265 million fundfor European film and television producers;     * Proceeds from a U.K. lottery were used to encourage a domesticfilm industry; and     * The French government mandates that at least half of itscountry's cable programming come from French producers.  Frenchproducers make about 150 films each year.     Indeed, the French government has been particularly hard onAmerican content.  For instance, it fought to keep Ted Turner'sCartoon Network off the country's television screens before finallyrelenting.     This could open up a huge market for European film producers. While more channels are being created (and more distribution pathssuch as cable and satellite), some European governments have vowed notto fill the additional channels with programming from the UnitedStates.     "I don't see any radical changes," Littlewood said.  "So whilethere is going to be more content in terms of channels, there arestill heavy restrictions on what is shown on specific Frenchchannels."     Other countries, however, appeared to have embraced Americanprogramming.  Germany-based The Kersh Group admitted recently that itwas going to increase its American content dramatically.  Analystsdeemed this revelation a blow to the German television industry.Consumer Wants     While some European governments are looking to legislateHollywood out of their countries, consumers are sounding a differentnote.     "In terms of popularity, people by and large prefer American madefilms," Littlewood said.  "They have a more universal appeal in Europethan films coming from any one particular country within Europe."     In France, for instance, U.S. films hold four of the top fivespots.  In Italy, U.S. films account for 75 percent of the market.     Indeed, few European films have achieved internationalpopularity.  Recently, there have been some exceptions (the U.K.'s"Four Weddings and a Funeral" and France's "Nikita" and "Cyrano" havetranslated well to the United States) but the general rule of thumb isthat Hollywood films will play well in Europe.     Some European producers see the trend changing.  With properfunding, European films could compete with Hollywood.  And thatfunding, as well as the unspoken Hollywood quotas, could lead to amore competitive environment.Convergence     1996 could be the year of the takeover/merger in the UnitedKingdom.  Many analysts predict consolidation in the cable industrywill continue.  Currently, the U.K. cable market is saturated, meaningnew alignments will be formed and companies will begin to sell offtheir divisions.     "The convergence between telephony and cable and interactiveservices is undoubtedly happening," Littlewood said.     The path is being smoothed somewhat by the British government,which is considering legislation relaxing cross-ownership limits,allowing more freedom for newspapers and broadcasters to be owned bythe same person.     John Hall, managing director of U.S.-based John Hall & Co. Inc.predicted cable finally will begin to make some inroads on thesatellite-dominated market.     "European cable should do well this year in a markettraditionally dominated by the satellite companies," Hall said.New Media     The new 'new media' market will offer content providers a newprogramming outlet, and everyone is looking for new areas of growth.     Newspapers, such as The Financial Times, are expected to playaround with online services far more this year.       "There are a lot of exciting developments in interactive games,"Littlewood said.  "Awareness of the Internet is surging."     Hall agreed, predicting the Internet will hit a global marketthis year.     "There will be tremendous market opportunities for any companythat knows how to use the Internet," Hall said.        Interactive television, however, will not be much of a factor in1996, analysts predicted.  The much-hyped technology still will be ina testing phase for much of the year.     "It hasn't taken off yet," Littlewood said.  "We are all waitingto see what the results of that are."Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN MEDIA BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996COMPANIES TO WATCH IN 1996:     * Pearson plc has transformed itself from a conglomerate into amuch more specific media company.

Indeed, many analysts are looking at X-rated movies and games asthe Infobahn's dirty little secret, saying they financially will drivethe digital highway's development to the tune of close to $1 billion.     The international market for adult-oriented programming quicklyis filling up with companies looking for profits:     * Playboy Entertainment increased its television presence from 17countries three years ago to 130 territories today;     * Graff Pay-Per-View Inc. adult programming is seen in Europe,nine former Communist countries, parts of Africa, the Middle East,Australia, Hong Kong and South America; and      * Graff's Home Video Channel boasted 200,000 U.K. subscribers atthe end of the second quarter.  Spice has about 20 million U.S.households;     * Penthouse formed a joint venture with Graff last fall to putits content on European television, computer services and CD-ROMs.     Analysts warn profits to be gained from adult-oriented materialare not necessarily limited to X-rated videos--even if they are one ofthe most profitable pay-per-view applications has been adult movies.     Adult-oriented games and gambling also are expected to make animpact on the Infobahn's bottom line.  For instance, when the popularMortal Kombat II was released last year, it brought in $50 million inthe first week alone.A Short Market     Few industry observers, however, believe adult material will havethe drawing power to continue financing the digital highway.     The same trends happened when the VCR was first released.  Adultvideos made up about 80 percent of the profits in the first year, butthey take in 10 percent now.     "I don't think [X-rated movies] will be a major money maker inthe interactive business," said Jeff Bernstein, vice president ofprogramming for Request TV.     While subscribers and revenues are up at many of the companiespeddling adult programs, so is the competition.       New adult satellite TV channels are launching in the UnitedKingdom, across Europe and into the Far East.  Graff executives blameCanada's more explicit adult services for the 8 percent drop in thecompany's DTH satellite revenues.     Adult programming has proved to be a risky venture for manycompanies--such as U.K.-based Red Hot Television, which crashed andburned in bankruptcy.  Even the genre's patriarch Playboy has had itsfinancial troubles over the years.     "The true test will be in three years to see who's around andthriving," Graff's Steve Saril told our sister publicationInternational Cable.Graff's Financials     The industry of sex is starting to be profitable for Graff, whichsaw its second quarter 1995 consolidated revenues rise 6 percent to$11.5 million.  The U.S.-based programmer owns the European-based HomeVideo Channel, Erotica and The Adult Channel.  It also owns Spice,Spice2 and Adam & Eve in the United States.     For the first six months of 1995, revenues were up 15 percent to$23.1 million.  Revenues for 1994 were $40.4 million, up 97 percentover 1993.     Graff executives point to Europe as their biggest growth area. The company entered the international market four years ago.  In thattime, it has had to learn to adapt to different foreign markets andforeign regulatory regimes.     To adapt, Graff tailors its programming to particular markets--meaning it will show dressed (heavily edited) or undressed (unedited)versions, said Christopher Yates, head of global expansion for Graffprogramming.     "We can tailor-make our service to a particular market," Yatessaid.  "We have the largest library and we produce the mostprogramming.  We have all versions of all kinds of product.  We canhave four or five versions of a network if we need to."     Playboy also offers different versions of its programming tosatisfy different markets, said Mary Herne, senior vice president,international division for Playboy Entertainment Group.     "Our programming works on both free TV and pay TV," Herne said.     She noted a syndication deal was signed with Middle East TVdistributor Orbit to carry the non-nude version of Playboy's soapopera "Eden."  It may be tame fare, comparatively, but it moves thePlayboy name and brand into the Middle East.     In contrast, she said, there's Germany, "which has consistentlytaken everything we've offered."     Playboy produces about 22 feature-length movies and 26 half-hourprograms a year.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN MEDIA BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SIDEBAR     The only countries that have been able to keep sex off TV havebeen ones with either stringent conservative governments or a lack ofpowerful satellite footprints.     "There really isn't any sex on TV in China," said Randy Barbato,director and producer of World of Wonder.     In Africa, where Graff and Playboy are pushing to launchchannels, the sexiest show the directors found was a bathing suitcontest on broadcast TV.     Middle East consumers circumvent their conservative governmentwith satellite dishes.     A European trend in broadcast fare has been to put sex into gameshows.  Broadcast TV stations in Spain, Italy and Germany have primetime shows that can be described as "Wheel of Fortune" with stripping.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN MEDIA BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BSKYB BEING INVESTIGATED     The Office of Fair Trading in the UK is launching a wide-ranginginvestigation into the programming supply arrangements of BSkyB(British Sky Broadcasting), which could impact severely on thesatellite company's exclusive sports deals. The investigation will gofurther than many in the industry expected and follows widespreadconcern voice by a number of franchisees.  The Director General ofFair Trading said the review "will be confined to the issues relatingto the supply in the United Kingdom of programming and relatedservices at wholesale level." The OFT is particularly concerned aboutthe length of BSkyB's sports contracts.  Exclusive sports contractshave been a long-time feature of British terrestrial broadcasting, butthe OFT said that the market had changed over the last few years withthe growth of pay television.  The key deal in question is the five-year agreement for soccer's Premier League, which includes a clauseenabling BSkyB to match rival broadcasters' bids for future rights.The investigation will run in parallel with OFT's main six-monthreview of the company's position in the pay-TV market.

The update contains a set of forecasts forthe interactive TV market to the year 2005. For the first time, theforecasts include projections for keycountries in Asia-Pacifica--Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea,New Zealand, and Singapore are covered.  John Matthews, principalconsultant with Ovum, said, "Interactive TV has been slow to take off,but it offers significant opportunities in the medium and the longterm. According to Matthews the United States will be the first areato become "cash positive" in interactive TV.  In 2002, Europe isforecast to make a profit on capital moniesinvested in the technology.  Ovum predicts that the Asia-Pacificregion will not become cash positive, even at 2005, the far range ofthe report's coverage.     Predictably, the United States will have about 26.4 millionhouseholds with cable access to interactive TV by the year 2005.

The strategy in developing the international market soundssimple: Developers need to read the markets they want to enterproperly.     "Everything is a risk," said Hasbro Interactive Worldwide's TomDusenberry.  "You have to hope you're betting on the right hardwareformats to go after.  You have to hope you're picking the rightproduct to make interactive.  That's something I lose sleep over."     Developers looking to make money off of foreign-language versionsof their English-language titles need to determine which titles todevelop from the beginning of a production cycle.     Developers also must account for how much memory variouscharacters or letters take up in different languages.  For example,German takes up 50 percent more space than English.  Japanese alsorequires a considerable amount of memory.     Using this strategy, two companies, Interplay Productions Inc.and Creative Wonders are hoping to increase revenues based on sales oftitles in Europe by 50 percent over the next year.Peanuts In Europe     Virgin Sound and Vision (VSV) also is channeling its enormousfinancial resources into sought-after licensing deals and aninternational launch strategy.     "We're looking at products with  global appeal and global recoupvalue, which allows us to put another hundred or hundred and fiftythousand into the title," said Tom Turpin, VSV president and CEO.     Virgin has inked deals with Softgold Gmbh in Germany and Hedarziin Israel to localize VSV title's for the developers' respectivemarkets.  The goal:  to create the same title in different languagesthat reflects their respective idioms and nuances.     "There's such a strong motivation (culturally) to get ahead inthose areas," Turpin said.     Funded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, the content-focusedsoftware company's first big title--Get Ready For School, CharlieBrown--hit stores last fall and provides a window into the company'sphilosophy.     Sparing no expense, Virgin licensed characters from UnitedFeatures Syndicate and worked with Bill Melendez Studios, the firmthat created the animation for the Charlie Brown television specials,to develop the title.Big Bird in Europe     Creative Wonders executives also are looking to popularchildren's characters for profits, but they seem to have taken it astep further.  Creative Wonders President Greg Bestick believes audioelements have become a more important part of multimedia software, sodevelopers should secure authentic voices to reach discriminatingconsumers.       The company dubbed in voices of local actresses and actors forthe characters in its line of Sesame Street titles.     "We also focus on finding local voice content--new voices for thedifferent countries," Bestick said.     One word of caution:  Keep the voice track separate from otherprogramming in a title.  "It's easier to localize if it's done thatway," Bestick said.Interplay's Plans     Localized products are more likely to sell if a publisher'sforeign release coincides with a domestic launch.       "Between 40 and 50 percent more products [sell] if the localversion comes out simultaneously with the U.S. release," Interplay'sJulie Roether said.     If publishers release a U.S. version first, they risk losing outon the sale of the foreign language version of a product.       If a German version of a product comes out much later than theEnglish version, it likely will have difficulty in the marketplace. Germans, who are very English literate, often will buy the firstversion of a product even if it is in English.     The biggest hurdle developers face in creating localized versionsof titles is making the commitment to do it.     "The initial returns aren't there," said Bestick. "It's a leap offaith."

No other consumer electronics manufacturer has stated that itwill simultaneously deliver DVD as a peripheral for the PC and as anaccompaniment to the television.     The company demonstrated for the first time its DVD playerprototype at  MIP Asia TV last week. Close to the new unified formatspecifications, the two-hour video was in PAL on two widescreen TVsets and was encoded in MPEG 2 in Eindhoven. It was stored on onelayer of a high density CD.     While the quality of the picture can be improved, only members ofthe Motion Pictures Experts Group could spot the flaws in the disc,which showed the movie Four Weddings and a Funeral. Even so, the presscovering the event seemed impressed with the crispness of the picturewith the freeze-frame function.     Market researchers predict 10 percent of consumers will but DVDplayers by the year 2000.       Philips realizes the importance of backward compatibility of itshigh- density player line in safeguarding the $120 trillion thatconsumers worldwide have spent on CD-ROMs, said Peter Van der Poll,general manager of Phillips Media Asia.     Van der Poll stressed the interchangeability between applicationsand played up the importance of the SD Alliance's acceptance ofPhilips' modulation scheme last September.  When asked, Van der Pollconfirmed that with the purchase of an MPEG card, all Philips Video CDproducts will work on a PC.     Philips' officials declined to estimate the cost of the DVDplayer, due to be launched in late 1997 or early 1998.      According to Van der Poll, Philips expects that the market for CDdrives will double in the next few years. The majority of the newbusiness will take the form of PC-based multimedia products.     Philips set up its Asian operations in Hong Kong because the cityis the home of electronic publishing, film and music in the region. As in Europe, the company is promising local language products inMandarin, Japanese, Korean, Cantonese, Malaysian, possibly Indonesianand Tagalog.     The company's hopes for the region are not limited to off-lineproducts.  Following the creation of United Philips Communications--the joint venture with United International Holdings Ltd. that hasresulted in Europe's largest private cable multiple system operator--Philips is weeks away from reaching agreements with three cableoperators in the region.     The aim is to create more networks and develop three more cableventures over the next two years, said Van der Poll. Localizing Content     As Philips tries to build up a CD catalogue, it will go to greatlengths to foster local content. "You need local content," Van derPoll said.  "Up to 60 percent of our music business is based on localcontent, local repertoire--we believe the same will be true for film,for entertainment and definitely for education."     The added benefit is that piracy will be reduced -- a problemthat in the past has been well documented in Asia, but which Van derPoll said is slowly getting better.      Looking to the future, Van der Poll said that co-productions withBeijing TV also are in the offing.  High-density CD-ROM will hit themarket by the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997.     He would not venture to anticipate the price, but offered, "ifyou want to be successful in a PC application, the price has to be,after a year or so, the same as the standards we are with now.  Itwill be of the same order of magnitude as the current CD." RewriteableCD is in the cards for 1998.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN MEDIA BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FILM FESTIVALS IN EUROPESolothurn Film FestivalJan. 16-21Unt.

No basic changes are expected in the political scene,even after the Parliamentary elections in 1996.  Macro-economic signsare very favorable, and it is widely presumed that Czech Republic hasgone through the difficult phase of transformation.     The main reasons for foreign investment are the Czech Republic'sfast economic development and its stable political situation.  TheCzech consumer and the advertising market have almost reached the samelevel as Western Europe.     Nova TV, which began broadcasting Feb. 4, 1994, was the firstprivate national television channel in Central Europe.  The stationquickly had the biggest market share and the highest number of viewersper day.     State television reacted to the increasing ratings of Nova TV bychanging the programming, adapting the prices and becoming much moreflexible.     There is only one private regional television station, Premiera,which covers more than 50 percent of the Czech Republic.  Itconcentrates on the economically strong areas--Prague and CentralBohemia.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN MEDIA BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996INTERACTIVE SERVICES CAUSE MILE-HIGH HEADACHES1995 was the year of the bug; will 1996 be the year it hits big?     A new, seemingly overlooked market is looming for film andtelevision producers looking to peddle their content: the airlineindustry.     Indeed, interactivity was the hottest buzzword in in-flightentertainment in 1995, but the systems airlines hoped would give theman edge over the competition were plagued with continued bugs anddelayed tests.     Enthusiasm continues among major airlines, despite challenges.     * Northwest was forced to shut down its test of an interactiveHughes-Avicom international system last summer.  Even still, thecarrier began tests of a redesigned version of the Hughes system inSeptember.       * United Airlines abandoned interactive features on its GECMarconi-supplied IFE systems after problems surfaced on systemsinstalled onboard its new Boeing 777 aircraft.       * Tests of interactive IFE systems scheduled with British Airwaysand American Airlines also were postponed because of technologychallenges.     * Plus, In-Flight Phone Corp. (IFPC) struggled with reliabilityissues and scrambled to convince Continental, USAir and America Westnot to cancel contracts.  IFPC began testing a new, debugged versionof its Flightlink IFE and communications system with Continental inSeptember.  The Promise and the Glitches     Even with the current problems, these advanced IFE systems holdconsiderable promise.       * IFPC's Flightlink system, for example, is slated to begin livemulti-channel television and audio broadcasts via satellite by thethird quarter of 1997 and plans to have the capability to send faxesto the ground from airline seats in the near future.     * BE Aerospace, which has an IFE system boasts video-on-demandcapability, says it is hopeful its system (scheduled to be tested withBA) will be ready for trials by March.       * Sony Trans Com teamed with Microsoft to develop a video-on-demand product it hopes to be ready for customers by 1997.       * Matsushita Avionics Systems Corp., the vendor for the AmericanAirlines IFE program, hopes to have video-on-demand capabilityavailable for that carrier's trial in the near future.     * Cathay Pacific announced in August it would install two IFEsystems on its fleet, with plans to upgrade to interactive capabilityby next year.              * In October, Alitalia went outside the pool of traditionalvendors to tap Interactive Flight Technologies Inc. (IFT) for a three-month, 30-seat trial of its interactive video-on-demand system in itsrecently revamped first class.  The system offers 22 video channelswith audio tracks in five languages. Videos played on the system arecompletely under individual control and can be started, stopped, orrewound by the passenger.     If the trial meets with success, the carrier hopes to roll outthe system on seven more planes by mid-1996.     "I still think there is a lot of smoke and mirrors out there,"Dean Haehnel, president of the World Airline Entertainment Association(WAEA), said about interactive IFE before the group's conference inAmsterdam.  "There are a lot of companies demonstrating products thathave never flown, and there is still a lot of work to be done in thearea of interactive and video-on-demand. That is really the problem,right now, the whole issue of reliability."The Gambling Cure     Another of the more promising---and unconventional---in-flightinnovations for carriers, vendors and passengers alike is in-flightgambling.     Finally, it seems, technology may have caught up with desire, asAlitalia's IFE system premiered the capability for in-flight gambling,though initially passengers will not play for money.      Also on the in-flight gambling front, Sky Games Internationalannounced recently it had inked an agreement to provide its gamblingsoftware for use with a major airline's in-flight entertainmentsystem. The software will be installed and ready for play as early asnext year.     Sources say the contract was signed with Singapore Airlines, butneither Sky Games nor the airline to date has confirmed this.     Although in-flight gambling has raised a number of concerns,industry studies suggest a single widebody jet equipped withinteractive IFE systems could generate up to $2 million a year -- halfof which would come from gambling.

Now here's the news:Back to Headline List CopyrightHDTV REPORT via NewsNetApril 15, 1991ARE BROADCASTERS FALLING BEHIND IN THE RACE TO HDTV?     As HDTV nears a critical juncture--the beginning of the FCCterrestrial transmission tests--there is concern thatbroadcasters are falling behind the satellite and cable TVindustries in the race for HDTV.     Satellites already have carried HDTV, and cable justannounced plans for demonstration transmissions of thetechnology.  Meanwhile, broadcasters have been forced to wait outthe FCC testing process.     HDTV REPORT editor Charlotte Wolter polled leading expertson whether the broadcast industry can keep pace as HDTV picks upsteam.  They said the cost of HDTV will be a significant problemfor broadcasters, more than for cable or satellites, which canget the technology on the air more quickly and inexpensively.     The good news is that broadcasters also are developingmodels for the introduction of HDTV that will keep costs withinreach of most local stations and keep the industry in the HDTVrace.     "Right now broadcasters face a tremendous cost imbalancerelative to cable companies," said Lynn Claudy, NationalAssociation of Broadcasters (NAB) director, advanced engineeringand technology.  "A broadcaster is inherently a local beast andultimately, any HDTV service would incorporate some local elementof production."     "Cable has an advantage in that they don't need atransmitter for every headend," said Julius Barnathan, seniorvice president for advanced technology and strategic planning,Capital Cities/ABC, "But...they would need new boxes that aresmart....Nobody gets off cheap."     While cable wins a short-term public relations coup from theHDTV initiative, the real impact, said James McKinney, chairmanof the Advanced Television Systems Committee, is to "reinforcethe absolute certainty that [broadcasters] must have a goodsystem."  In the past, he said, broadcasters assumed a standardcould be "good enough--not as good as MUSE or what we seeelsewhere--but good enough.  But this means they have to picksomething that is a golden standard, and if they don't, otherswill be ahead of them."     The cable demonstrations also have raised the specter thatbroadcasters will be left behind.  "That's a significant portionof the motivation to move ahead," said Howard Miller, senior vicepresident of broadcast operations and engineering for PBS.  Butwith its role in the FCC process, "Is cable going to march offahead," Miller asked.  "Not unless broadcasting chooses not to doit."Broadcasters Must Find Whether There Is a Business in HDTV     Given its inherent cost disadvantage, broadcasters have todecide how to compete in HDTV.  "Is terrestrial going to be [likeAM radio after FM appeared] and find a different local business,or will it be able to continue to play competitively in this newarena," asked Joseph Flaherty, vice president and generalmanager, engineering development, for CBS.  "Certainly cable,[direct broadcast satellite], home video and fiber can play inthe game."     "The question remains, how do broadcasters secure profit outof it," said McKinney.  "When color came on, broadcasters chargedextra if someone wanted a commercial in color."  Miller agreed,"From the station standpoint, it's a very basic question: Isthere any revenue potential with this technology?  They have tothink very carefully about whether they will make theinvestment."     Nevertheless, there is optimism that conversion is possible.During this week's NAB National Show, Flaherty will present adetailed study that will state that stations have a wide range ofchoices for conversion.  It will suggest a 4-step process,starting with signal pass-through for as little as $1 million--with digital HDTV.  Next, stations can add local 16:9broadcasts with a wide- screen version of today's TV, then alower-quality version of the FCC standard, then finally fullHDTV.  Studio equipment, the most costly item, can be phased inover 5-7 years on regular replacement schedules.     Economies also can be found in studio conversion, saidMerrill Weiss, managing director, advanced television systems,for NBC.  Serial digital systems now finding their way intostudios could be adapted for HDTV, he said, if the right choicesare made in data rates and formats.     Each station, Flaherty emphasized, will find a scheduleappropriate for its market.  "Large markets have funds to do itfirst and tend to be in tougher competitive environments.Smaller stations do it later, and even in major markets theydon't do everything at once."     Flaherty believes an industry that made the transition fromblack and white to color can handle HDTV.  "People worried aboutcost, and it took time for smaller stations, but it would be hardto find a black-and-white station today.It's not simple, not cheap; it's very difficult and takes goodbusiness judgment, but we've done it before," he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightHDTV REPORT via NewsNetApril 15, 1991HDTV DISPLAYS:  MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE FORCONSUMER MARKET     As the HDTV broadcast picture begins to clear,it has becomemore and more apparent that a criticalelement is missing:low-cost, large-screen displays of 40 inches diagonally orlarger.  The lack of suitable displays is a serious bottleneck inthe development of a consumer market for HDTV.     Many are convinced the HDTV experience is apparent only onscreens 40 inches across and larger.  Large displays are"absolutely" necessary, said Julius Barnathan of ABC.  "Let the[40-inch CRT] stick out into an apartment," he joked, adding,"This is a problem, a fundamental problem."     "Until we have large screens, the American public is notgoing to be swayed," said the NAB's Lynn Claudy.  "It hasto...really slap them in the face. That's possible with largescreens--4, 5, 6 feet."     But CRTs are difficult to make that size and would be toobulky for the average home.  "Sony made a 46-inch [CRT], but itweighs hundreds of pounds. That size will be the end for tubes,"said D. Joseph Donahue, senior vice president, technology andbusiness development for Thomson Consumer Electronics. "Today noone knows how to make large flat panels [that size]--never mindthe economics, just to demonstrate."  The industry "might seedemos this decade," he said, but not flat-screen products.     Some HDTV displays based on current technology will sell."The 27-inch [variety] is the most popular, at 4:3 [aspectratio]," said James McKinney of the Advanced Television SystemsCommittee.  "What's important is screen height.  If you take thesame height and convert it to high-definition [9:16 aspectratio], you come out to 37-38 inches diagonally [a size CRTs canmanage]."     "High-definition makes as much sense in a 17-as in a 40-inchset," said Greg DePriest, vice president, advanced TV technologyand strategic planning for Toshiba America.  "I don't think HDTVmeans the end of 17-or 22-inch sets."Back to Headline List CopyrightHDTV REPORT via NewsNetApril 15, 1991CONSUMER HDTV MONITORS ON THE MARKET IN 1991CONSUMER HDTV MONITORS ON THE MARKET IN 1991Company  Screen Size  Type  Transmitter  Features          CostSony         36"      CRT      MUSE   Separate encoder   $18,000Hitachi      46"      CRT      MUSE   Integrated decoder  N/AToshiba      36"      CRT      MUSE  Shows 1125 and 525  15,100                                     non-interlacedSharp       100"      LCD      MUSE  Price has potential $139,000                   Projector         to be much cheaperPhilips      36"      CRT      D2-MAC Separate encoder   $5,400                                      with smartcard slotThomson      36"      CRT      D2-MAC Decoder separate now $6,000                                      but eventually                                      integratedNokia        36"      CRT       D2-MAC   To appear late '91 N/ABack to Headline List CopyrightHDTV REPORT via NewsNetApril 15, 1991**SPECIAL REPORT--AN INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD WILEY**     HDTV REPORT editors David Bross and Britton Manasco sat downrecently with the Chairman of the FCC Advisory Committee onAdvanced Television Service, Richard Wiley, for a wide-ranginginterview on the state of the global HDTV industry and the FCC'sefforts in moving toward selecting a U.S. HDTV standard.  Theinterview was conducted at Wiley's Washington, D.C., law firmWiley, Rein & Fielding.  Wiley was the chairman of the FCC from1974-77 and also served as an FCC commissioner and generalcounsel.  Here's what he had to say:HDTV REPORT:  Why has the United States opted for a mandatedHDTV standard rather than having one evolve naturally in themarketplace?Wiley:  I can only speculate, to some extent, because it is,obviously, an FCC determination.  They set up the advisorycommittee.  I think the reason is we're dealing here with a veryimportant decision for the country.  When you look at when thelast television standard was set--in the 1940s--you realizewhatever decision you make is going to be an important one.  Ithink it's one in which the government feels it wants the privatesector input, but it ultimately needs to make the decisionitself.  I think this commission, unlike decisions that pastcommissions might have made, wants to make that decision.  Ithink it's a very interesting process and hopefully will be aneffective one.              One thing it clearly has done is to stimulateprivate sector activity in this area.  Before the fall of 1987,I'm not aware of very much that was going on in HDTV in thiscountry.  We've got some very impressive U.S. proponents, as wellas foreign proponents, and we have well over 500people drawn from various private sector companies, many of themU.S.-based, who are active in the work of the advisory committee.And I think that out of this may come a very good decision.HDTV REPORT:  If American-based companies knew that theirforeign-based competitors were active in HDTV prior to 1987, whythe lack of movement domestically?  Were there barriers to HDTVdevelopment?Wiley:  No, I don't think so.  Of course, we have not been asbig a factor in the television manufacturing business as we mighthave, but I think that this effort has, perhaps, renewed some ofour resolve in this area.  It brought out some of ourtechnological prowess, which is good.  But I can't tell you whywe weren't involved in it before.  To some extent, we may haveleapfrogged some of the activity that has gone on abroad--ifdigital-based technologies prove they will actually work.HDTV REPORT:  Are developments in compression driving therecent push toward digitally based HDTV systems?Wiley:  Yes, I think there have been, as I understand it, somecompression breakthroughs that companies have developed.  I thinkthe stimulus of General Instrument coming forth with a digitalsystem is good.  I think it drove some of the other proponents toexamine what they are doing and to see whether or not they coulduse that same technology to bring their product to themarketplace.             A year and a half ago we had a meetingin Chairman Sikes' office with a number of engineers in thisfield and they felt that terrestrial broadcasting, digitally, wasnot possible--perhaps not even in this century.HDTV REPORT:  Is it taken as a given by the FCC that thecontinued profitability of the local broadcaster is in the publicinterest?Wiley:  No, I don't think that's the basis on which thecommission decided to pursue terrestrial broadcasting.  Thecommission has not said that it is trying to protect broadcastingprofitability or even the industry itself.  I think thecommission's theory is that terrestrial transmission may be thequickest and the least expensive way to bring advanced televisionservice to the American people.     At the same time, we're not trying to hold back othertechnologies.  I'd encourage cable to work very closely withbroadcasting so that we can have an advanced television systemthat will work for both broadcasting and cable.  And I've beenvery pleased that the 2 industries have been working together inharmony on this through the Advanced Television Test Center andCableLabs.     I think that's one of the great advantages of our systemhere.  Also we've encouraged, and had a working party look at,alternative media.  If there is a direct broadcast satellitesystem in this country, it can go right ahead and provideadvanced television service.     But the point is, we don't have that currently in thiscountry.  But we all have television sets.  We do have a veryubiquitous broadcast and cable system in this country and I thinkthe commission has rightly determined that this is the best wayto proceed for now.  Clearly, Japan and Western Europe arelooking at a DBS service for HDTV and that should be technicallypossible here as well.     Nothing the advisory committee is doing should impede [DBS].I think that's an advancement in the state of the art.  If ithappens, so be it.  There's one thing I would like to add,however.  We are a little different than Japan.  We have 4 timezones in this country--a very geographically large country.  TheFCC also has a commitment to localism in broadcasting and I thinkthat fits naturally with [its call for] a terrestrial means oftransmission.  But I don't see it as a protectionist view forbroadcasting, so I support what they've done.HDTV REPORT:  Recently, Chairman Sikes has expressed concernover the speed at which the test committee is moving--what is thestatus of testing?Wiley:  Well, I agree with him, of course, that we want to keeppushing the process.  Yes, we've had delays, but I think thetheory has been that we're going to keep setting deadlines andthen back off the deadlines if there are developments thatnecessitate it.  There are a number of reasons why we'veexperienced delays.  Number one, the proponents have changedtheir designs and their formats.  Four of them have gone todigital modes.  They would not have been ready to be tested underthe old schedule.  And I think it's in the public interest tohave had that delay and I think Al Sikes agrees.     Number 2, there have been delays in the delivery ofequipment to the advanced television test center.  The formatconverter, manufactured by Techtronics, has been delayed.  I'mnot saying that in criticism of that company, because it is avery complex product, but I think it is characteristic of theproblems that we are running into.     We're sailing on a sea that has never been charted before.The equipment that we are utilizing to test these systems hasnever been made before.  The proponents themselves have neverbeen there.  So, I think some delay has probably been inevitableand probably beneficial.  The bad news is there has been a delay.The good news is there has been a delay.* Editor's Note: Look for more coverage of our interview withRichard Wiley in the next news-filled issue of HDTV REPORT.Back to Headline List CopyrightHDTV REPORT via NewsNetApril 15, 1991EVERYONE'S DOING IT:  HDTV SOFTWARE DEMAND HEATINGUP; INVESTORS EYE PROFITS     This will be the year the tremendous investments that HDTVproduction pioneers made inexpensive and untried equipment willbegin to pay off.  There finally will be enough demand for HDTVproduction to provide a return to the production houses that havegeared up for HDTV, industry sources told us.     "It's really picking up this year," said Club TheaterNetwork President Ron Ratner, whose company has an HDTVproduction studio, including an HDTV telecine.  "I think we didmore in January and February in high-definition than all lastyear, billable, not giving away stuff anymore."     Some organizations that are potential buyers of HDTV      programming are:     * NHK: The Japanese national broadcaster plans to up its DBS      broadcasts to      6, and some say 8, hours per day by the end of the year.       Movies converted      to HDTV will take up a significant chunk of that time, but      the broadcaster      also has ordered travelogues, music programming and sports;     * PBS: Public broadcasting is committed to demonstrating      advanced television for the public, said Senior Vice      President Howard Miller, but it currently is struggling to      assemble equipment donations.  However, PBS plans      original HDTV productions, probably in music, for 1991;     * Cable: It is not clear if CableLabs' HDTV demonstration      will include original programming, but it is linked to      Scientific-Atlanta's HDTV production/transmission venture      with Captain New York, which will produce and transmit      special-event programming via satellite;     *Europe: The advent of B-MAC broadcasts will require wide     aspect-ratio programming, some of which will be original     programming; and     * Non-broadcast markets: There is growing demand in special     effects for films and projection HDTV for amusement parks     and public displays.     While producers are beginning a wider variety of projects,most of the pioneering HDTV producers are seeing an increase inprojects, not just for NHK but for other buyers as well,including:     * Zbig Vision Ltd.: NHK just commissioned a documentary     called "Manhattan"      and another called "Washington," for a total of one hour of     HDTV.  Zbig      also will produce a one-hour special on Franz Kafka for a     French company,      Telemax.  The show will be shot on a sound stage with     actors inserted into      a set of miniatures and models reproducing Prague of      Kafka's time;     * Captain New York: President David Niles said his company     has done fashion shows for NHK, as well as music,      travelogues, ballet,opera--universally acceptable      programming.  An adventuresome project has been to film      comedian Jackie Mason in HDTV.  He added, "There is serious     talk of networks of movie theaters joining up this summer"      for what he describes as "close-up concerts," where artists      are filmed close up in the studio to give the audience the      feeling of being at a small concert;     * NHK: Rupert Stow, who coordinated the NAB's HDTV     programming sessions,      said NHK is "straining to fill 3 hours or more each day     with electronically produced high-definition programming,"     with nature programming popular.  "They tend to go overseas     for entertainment, and some of the programs they are     financing in this country are art- or entertainment-based;"     and     * Club Theater Network: Ratner predicted studios will use     his telecine for "action movies or production-value movies,     lots of blow-ups and lots of chase scenes."  The company     also is doing special effects using a Symbolics machine and     opticals with an HDTV Ultimatte.  In discussion are a     long-haul demonstration with fiber optics network firm Vyvx     and a project with cable.Back to Headline List CopyrightHDTV REPORT via NewsNetApril 15, 1991*High-definition television (HDTV) has hit the Japanese market*High-definition television (HDTV) has hit the Japanese marketyears ahead of plans by other nations.  Most large Japaneseelectronics makers have introduced new consumer HDTV products,including televisions, videocassette recorders and adapters thatallow HDTV broadcasts to be seen on present TV sets.  But withthe new sets priced at 10 times or more than that of currenttop-of-the-line models, consumers may not be rushing to thestores.  The new equipment, displayed at an internationalbroadcast equipment show near Tokyo, demonstrates how far aheadJapanese companies are in commercializing the technology.  Pricesfor the new equipment on display at the show ranged from aMercedes Benz to a Ford.  Sony's new 36-inch HDTV set, one of theless-expensive models announced, lists for about $17,700.  Acompany spokesman insisted the sets will be bought by "ordinary"Japanese, to whom Sony plans to sell an initial 100 sets permonth.  "Our current 32-inch model is priced at about $30,700.In 5 years, we hope to bring that down to about $7,700," saidHideji Matsuda of Toshiba's new media division.Back to Headline List CopyrightHDTV REPORT via NewsNetApril 15, 1991     *PrimeStar Partners, the Pennsylvania-based DBS service, has     *PrimeStar Partners, the Pennsylvania-based DBS service, hasintroduced a new integrated receiver-decoder (IRD) that hasinterfaces for both digital compression and HDTV, so that theservices can be added without replacing the IRD.

When the FCC makes the final decision on anHDTV terrestrialtransmission standard, sometime early in 1993, the commissionprobably will be picking winners and losers, industry analyststold HDTV REPORT.  One company or group of companies is likely tocelebrate while others mourn the lost millions they invested.     The FCC is likely "to pick one of the systems that we knowabout now and not likely to force some combination, like theZenith RF system and GI's encoding system," predicted JamesMcKinney, of the Advanced Television Systems Committee.  "Out ofthe tests will come one victor."     There are 2 major parts to the technologies--bandwidthcompression and the transmission system.  Asking contenders tocombine features of their systems could be both a technologicaland copyright nightmare, and could produce the proverbialcamel--a horse designed by committee.     The perception that the government probably will go for onesystem has proponents jockeying to combine or redefine proposals."There have already been a few accommodations," said CBS' JosephFlaherty.  "Whether they combine or not will be a commercialdecision.  I don't think the government will force[combinations]."  He added, "The digital systems are similar, butthere are enough differences that one could have an advantageover the others."     "There will be some losers," said Merrill Weiss of NBC, "buta single winner is very difficult to predict."Zenith-General Instrument Still Viewed as Potential Combination     One combination generating frequent speculation is GeneralInstrument and Zenith.  "I think it would be a wonderfulcombination," said McKinney, "but GI is more interested thanZenith."  He added, "GI needed help, but they have gotten thatnow in their combination with MIT.  That gave them a dramatic legup in the RF area.  Their weakness was in the transmissionsystem, the RF system, and that has now [probably] been coveredby MIT."     Still, a Zenith-GI coupling is attractive.  "It would makean obvious all-American winner," McKinney said.  Another factoris that Zenith is a manufacturer of receiving equipment, while GIand MIT are not.  Although the winner will have to license thetechnology, "if an equipment manufacturer wins, they get to buildfor free, so that's probably why GI is interested," he said.     There is still time right up to testing date for proponentsto get together on their own, "but once they enter the [AdvancedTelevision Test Center] lab and put the equipment on the test bedand run tests, then it's very difficult," warned McKinney.  "Thisis big risk time.  I don't think everybody is going to win," hesaid.  "They're all big boys and they know what they're doing."Back to Headline List WT03-B10-12IA087-000629-B024-9http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/pb07.html 205.156.212.5 19970122040954 text/html 347949HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:07:06 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:29 GMTContent-length: 347761Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/pb07.html Sample Issue Copyright INFORMATION TODAY via NewsNet January 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES *COVER STORIES AND NEWS* LONDON ONLINE SHOW ATTRACTS RECORD CROWD (312 words) COMPUTER SECURITY SURVEY: FINANCIAL LOSSES AND INTERNET BREAK-INS (522 words) CADMUS DEBUTS JOURNALS.AT-HOME, TEAMS WITH UNCOVER CO.

More than half of those surveyed reported security-related financiallosses in the past year--with 20 companies reporting losses in excess of $1million. And of those using the Internet for exchanging informationexternally, 20 percent reported successful or attempted break-ins in the pastyear.     Forty percent of the Internet business users expressed dissatisfactionwith Internet security, the survey found. At the same time, a commanding 87percent of Internet users stated that they would use it more for businesspurposes if security were enhanced. More than two-thirds of those not usingthe Internet now, but planning to within a year, said they would increasetheir potential use even more if its security were improved.     Most companies surveyed admit that they do not have adequate tools orproperly trained personnel to defend against information security losses,which can run into millions of dollars. But Daniel E. White, an Ernst & Youngpartner specializing in information security, points out, "Companies aredemonstrating growing awareness of security problems and increased willingnessto devote additional resources to their solution."     "Information security should be decentralized," said White. "As companiesrely on advanced information technology to exchange data among remotelocations such as plants, branch offices, and warehouses, effective securitysystems need to be implemented in those locations, and the people in chargelocally must regard information security as part of their responsibility. Toassist in this effort, common guidelines for security must be developedcentrally and uniformly enforced at all locations."     The report, which surveyed 1,300 chief information officers (CIOs) andother senior information executives, looked at a wide array of other securityissues, ranging from problems of "telecommuting" employees with remote accessto a company's systems to the importance of being placed on security in newclient/server environments.     Other key survey findings are:     --   More than two-thirds of respondents surveyed reported encountering          a virus in the past year.     --   A lack of proven security tools/solutions is a major obstacle to          good information security.     --   A notable increase was reported in the number of security heads who          report to the CIO (43 percent in 1995, 32 percent in 1994, and 27          percent in 1993).     "Our survey results over the past three years show that informationsecurity issues are becoming better understood. And the increased awarenessthat management is putting on computer security is very encouraging--budgetsare increasing, more tools are being implemented, and security professionalsare becoming more involved in the systems development process," White said.     The survey also reports that nearly half the companies surveyed haveongoing information security awareness programs, although fewer companies havesuch programs as part of the orientation process for new employees. More thanthree-fourths have a formal corporate information/data security policy.

A QUESTION OF VALUE     by Leonard M. Fuld     [Editor's Note: This is the first in a series of three articles bypublishing consultant and writer Leonard Fuld addressing the future of onlinedatabases and the changing information climate. His two subsequent articleswill run in the February and March issues of "IT."]     The information Ice Age is here. The Internet has opened the informationseeker's mind. Yet, at the same time, it may have begun the Ice Age fortraditional databases. As found on the Internet, information has become cheapto get and relatively easy to find. Not that the data is necessarily highquality or even timely; it's just that it's low in cost and may actually meetthe average person's needs. Practically overnight, large numbers of folks whoare not info-junkies or trained information professionals have discoveredelectronic information. The big question facing the database producers now is:"What do we do for an encore?"     Database publishers should take a lesson from rock-and-roll bands. Likerock bands, databases have seen evolutionary change: creation, extinction,absorption, and even enhancement. I remember seeing a family tree of sortsthat tracked the path that rock-and-roll has taken, where particular musicianshave gone, what band they joined, and where they moved next. Databases havefollowed a similar course of development. The ones that did not meet a needdied. Those that did meet a need either grew or were merged into larger datapools.     Database historians looking back at the late 1990s will likely point tothis period as one of meteoric change. They will indeed have a great deal ofmaterial from which to draw their conclusions. Just examine today's electronicpublishing headlines:     --   Low cost + sophistication: InfoSeek, an inexpensive Internet searchservice, is accessed over 1 million times a day and processes over 500,000full-text inquiries. The basic monthly subscription charge is $9.95, withrelatively modest search fees for some special services it offers. InfoSeekSearch includes such databases as Associated Press Online, Reuters BusinessReport, Commerce Business Daily, and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts. Theservice even offers customers the ability to create relatively sophisticatedinformation filters. These filters will help customers limit the amount ofinformation they need to see. Has InfoSeek laid down the gauntlet to DIALOGand LEXIS-NEXIS? You bet. Is this cheap, low-quality information? No, justreasonable information, inexpensively obtained.     --   "Have it your way," two lines of attack: PR Newswire, a databasecontaining corporate press releases from many (but a limited number) of U.S.corporations, leapfrogged traditional database delivery systems. You can nowtap into PR Newswire directly through the Internet, or you can phone anautomated faxback system. By calling a special number and following the menudirections, you can order one or a series of press releases--all at no chargeto the caller. Use the phone pad or the keyboard; it makes no difference to PRNewswire. Either way, you get the data.     --   Volume discounts: CD-ROMs are making online access to directoriesalmost obsolete. Why pay thousands of dollars to access countless names onlinewhen you can buy a series of discs that hold over 80 million names, addresses,and telephone numbers for approximately $100?     Instead of heeding these warning signals and racing to upgrade theirproducts or the means to deliver their products, many publishers and databasedistributors have merely taken baby steps. Some have decided that growththrough acquisition of other databases is the way to fend off competition.Others have improved their front-end search engine--or at least itsappearance. Is bigger necessarily better? Is prettier better than smarter?These are questions demanding answers.     To a certain extent, the larger and richer the database the more valuableit becomes--up to a point. Big databases take more maintenance and becomedifficult to tailor and enhance. Adding fields or features becomes a complextask, as the data itself has become less uniform, more diverse than itssmaller predecessor. It is very possible future publishers will look back 10or 20 years from now and view behemoth databases as data dinosaurs, notmalleable or user friendly.     The survivors, the entities that will actually thrive, will do so becausethey have adapted to the new information environment. In this environment,there will be two classes of databases: those that are low priced, offeringlittle added value to the user, and those that charge a premium forspecialized data that have been--or can be--massaged.     The low-priced databases will be forced to practically give away theirfiles and their data. These database publishers can expect slim margins. Theirusers can expect rudimentary results and will not pay a high price for whatthey receive. In contrast, the high-priced databases will deliver high-qualityresults, not just data. Publishers of such databases will need to maintain theinfrastructure to retain the quality and to constantly add enhancements.     Most of today's database publishers operate in the high-priced arena andpresumably would like to stay there. All this costs. They have built expensivesupport, communications, and data processing facilities. I include the IAC,Chemical Abstracts, and Derwent databases in this group. Yet the Internet isforcing the price per unit of raw data down to extremely low levels. Theaverage consumer, even the corporate librarian pressed by a tight budget,would rather choose the free alternative than the fee-based one.     Plummeting database prices have already begun to squeeze the profits outof the bottom line. Without the margins to support the existing business, thetraditional database publishing infrastructure itself may erode. The resultmay be the bankruptcy of certain databases. This would be a loss to both thepublishers and to the public.ACCESS, ACCURACY, AND ADDED VALUE     If today's database publishers want to thrive in years ahead, they mustenhance offerings to their information-savvy public by dramatically improvingtheir product quality. The quality issue goes far beyond spell-checking orindexing. It goes to the core of the product itself. Future database qualitywill be measured by three criteria: access, accuracy, and added value.     Access refers to the ease of entry into the system and to the dataitself. The more the user has access to the knowledge embedded within adatabase, the more useful and user-friendly that database becomes. Incontrast, the greater the black box effect, the less the user will want touse--or to pay--for that source. For instance, if a searcher needed to findinformation on local area networks but just plugged in the term LAN, would thedatabase find all related terms and technologies? Right now, the answer is hitor miss. The skilled searcher may know to look for all synonyms, but theprofessor, salesperson, purchasing manager, or executive, who is frequentlythe ultimate user, may not. Future database publishers will have to cater tothis group of decision-makers; besides, economics will dictate that databasesmigrate to this broader population and further away from the librarian who isoften the database gatekeeper. These decision-makers want answers, not merelydata; the services that can most easily provide them with answers will win.     In the future, access will mean that, despite the fact that searchers maynot have known all the relationships and technical synonyms, they will easilyfind the complete answer. And if they can't find it in the high-priceddatabases, then they will naturally select the low-priced databasealternatives, despite all the deficiencies and inconveniences they represent.Even today, if PR Newswire offers some of the news (albeit biased), why shouldthe cost-conscious manager go to Information Access Corporation's PROMT or tothe Dow Jones or Reuters news services? PR Newswire's content may be biasedand somewhat unstructured, but it's also inexpensive and easy to find. For theharried manager who just wants information, it may suffice.     Accuracy is the second criterion and perhaps conceptually the easiest fortoday's publishers to meet. Databases filled with errors or poor abstractingwill suffer alongside the more accurate ones. At the same time, error-pronedatabases or those lacking specificity will lose against even poorly managedInternet Usenet groups or Internet-available databases. After all, where isthe benefit in the consumer's eyes? Why pay for only partial or inaccuratedata, when you can get the equivalent for a lot less money?     Unfortunately, accuracy, while important, remains the least visible ofthe three criteria. Typographical errors aside, other types of errors areelusive, only caught by a few. Once again, the busy manager or academic maymiss the inaccuracies, casting a longer glance at the final bill.MORE INSIGHT, LESS DATA     Finally, added value represents the greatest threat--and opportunity--todatabase publishers in the 1990s. Database publishers are currently spendinggreat amounts of money on adding content to their information pool, withoutdoing much to enhance its value in the eyes of business decision makers (alarge part of the market). Decision makers want fewer, more focusedfindings--not more data in the form of paper. Database producers need to addthis value. They need to create information summaries, or maps of the data,anything that will help the consumer answer questions earlier and moreperceptively. Instead of receiving endless printouts, decision makers wantsummaries that will help point them in the right direction. Users want thesesystems to identify trends, and to winnow out the valuable from the valueless.Users, in short, want insight, not just more data.     Business managers want to receive early warnings of market shifts or acompetitor's new product development. They do not want to read more historyand countless articles repeating the same message over and over again. Theultimate customers are willing to pay a premium for time-saving notices.     Many of today's better-constructed databases already have the built-instructure, the indexing, to offer their users a better end product. Inparticular, I am thinking of the Derwent patent databases, Chemical Abstracts,and the Predicast/IAC series with their specific product and event codes.These and others like them contain embedded coding that should help thesepublishers further enhance their end products' value. Give me a clusteranalysis of patents to help me determine a competitor's technology strategy,or provide me with signs that a competitor may be changing its target market.This is added value. In certain cases, third-party vendors offer some of thesesolutions today. However, the publishers themselves need to offer theseproducts. They know their products best and would benefit the most from animproved, more user-friendly deliverable.     Either the publishers need to enhance the way they store the data, orthey need to work with concerns that can enhance the front end, the means tomassage the existing data. The more automated a database publisher can makethe product, the more data the user will need. It's a win-win situation foreveryone: the decision-maker as well as the publisher.     Today's lack of added value has become the greatest barrier--a knowledgebarrier--for the online database world. I know many corporate executives whorefuse to examine the database printouts their library sends them simplybecause the volume is too great, or the information gems are too difficult toidentify. The searchers themselves are often at a loss as to how to presentthe data in a more sophisticated form. Hence, insights that the databasesearch could yield never surface. Critical knowledge is missed.     Currently, the database industry apparently thinks it is deliveringvalue-added business information--at least as far as the advertisements read."Competitive intelligence" and "business intelligence" crop up in the databasepress all the time. By and large, database publishers and the systems they useto distribute the data do little more than group or compile it like pieces ofinformation. I have seen few products that truly analyze or even save the usera great deal of time.     True, publishers have found ways to pool data into blocks of information,but they have failed to add enough value, to turn this information intodecision-producing intelligence. The information consumer realizes this. Thedatabase community should be warned of the axiom: "Nothing kills a bad productfaster than good advertising." Publishers need to dramatically improve theirvalue-added offerings or suffer the consequences of dwindling usage.     Publishers must learn how to mine the value inherent in their products.Those that do will continue to command the value/price high ground. Theircustomers will be equally happy with the improved, time-saving,decision-producing results they receive.     Whether or not the database world realizes it, its environment hasalready begun to change. With an increasing number of sophisticated electroniccompetitors entering this new world, the competitive climate is growingharsher. The publishers and distributors that survive will be the ones whorecognize and act on this changing information climate.

His most recent book is "The NewCompetitor Intelligence" (John Wiley & Sons, NY, 1995).]Back to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION TODAY via NewsNetJanuary 1996WHAT'S AHEAD FOR 1996?     Once again "Information Today" is starting off a new year with someforward thinking by presenting the predictions of a number of executivesselected from varied segments of the information industry. We asked them totell us what they foresee developing in the industry and at their companiesduring 1996 and beyond.     Here's a look into the future of one of the most exciting, mostimportant, and most rapidly evolving industries--one that is taking the worldin new directions. Let's see where some of our industry leaders think we'reheaded.     Morris Goldstein     Chief Executive Officer     Information Access Company     If 1995 was the year of Internet access, then 1996 is the year of theWorld Wide Web. It is the beginning of an era in which content, computing, andtelecommunications converge, altering the world's business landscape as weknow it today.     The center of activity in the computing world will shift from aclient/server platform to the World Wide Web. Large software players (such asMicrosoft, IBM/Lotus, and Oracle), as well as major online services (AmericaOnline, CompuServe, and Microsoft Network, to name a few), will make the Webenvironment their number one priority for software and service development.     As part of this shift, we will see the emergence of groupwarecapabilities for the Web, greater ease of use, expanded functionality, and adramatic acceleration of information usage among novice end users andinformation professionals. In parallel, new publishing ventures will exploitthe commercial potential of the Web by developing low-cost, multimediaalternatives to traditional print and electronic media, thus helping to expandthe information industry's financial model from a usage-supported paradigm toone that is partially advertising supported.     In a related development, specialty services such as executiverecruitment, travel, real estate, financial services, and insurance brokerageswill expand their Web-based offerings, enabling their customers to easilylocate business and leisure opportunities, weigh options, and make competitiveprice comparisons.     As corporations de-emphasize restructuring and reengineering toconcentrate on "top line growth" in order to command leadership positions intheir markets, 1996 will witness center stage growth in the areas of knowledgecreation and ongoing knowledge management. At the core of this opportunitywill be the corporate information specialist, whose expertise in monitoringthe external marketplace and creating actionable knowledge will be critical tothe successful outcome of daily corporate decision making. Companies that aretuned into the dynamic nature of this process will commit budget funds to thecreation and management of knowledge as a means of stimulating innovation andrevenue growth.     At the same time, public and academic libraries will develop as thepreferred electronic information "hubs" for their communities and continue toimprove their services by offering remote access to patrons who wish toutilize the Internet and other electronic services from their dorm rooms,faculty offices, and homes. For this reason, many libraries will makesignificant investments to support access to services that require intelligentworkstations.     During a period of accelerating paradigm shifts, it's unlikely that theinformation industry and even the concept of databases will remain status quo . . . but that's a good topic for next year's predictions!     Steve Arnold     President     Arnold Information Technology     A new medium has been invented in the last 12 months. "Internet" is theword applied to a cluster of technologies that is blending and breeding at avery fast rate. A normal publishing year has 12 months; the Internet year hasthree months. No one doubts that for the electronic information community,there are both opportunities and challenges.     Over the next 12 months, five forces (what I call "vectors") will gainmomentum. The first is rising cost and competitive pressure in traditionalinformation companies. Particularly stressed will be those firms in legal,scientific-technical, and professional publishing. The old models areevolving, and authors are going direct to readers. Governments can no longerafford to print paper copies of their prodigious output. The Internet is lesscostly and does not kill trees.     Second, the Internet makes available a delivery and content platform thatallows customers to experience information, not just read it. New businesseswill flourish in response to keen customer demand for old information in newpackages. The game model is replacing the reference book model.     Third, the traditional database world is in the process of transformingitself from text to a multiobject format. The result is a new syntax andrhetoric packaged in compound complex digital documents (C2D2). Why just readabout an experiment when one can see it take place and examine the data setsit generated.     Fourth, the era of intelligent text processing and agents that performvalue-adding functions once associated with human workers will become part ofthe desktop. New online companies will exploit these technologiesaggressively, meeting little or no resistance from established online "brand"names. There are not enough human indexers or money to pay them. Software isfast and comparatively economical.     Fifth, the pace of change will enable the technologically adept anddisable the technologically inept. Companies that refuse to embrace the newmedium will fall far back in the competitive pack.     The opportunities are unparalleled in the history of communications, notjust electronic publishing. For many firms and individuals, the challengeshave never been greater. One thing is crystal clear--once these vectors ofchange have been let loose, they will be difficult to control.     John J. Regazzi     President and CEO     Engineering Information Inc.     Lately I find myself tossing off a phrase that I believe so welldescribes the world today and especially the current nature of the informationindustry. I wish I could attribute it to its proper source: "The future," itgoes, "isn't what it used to be."     It seems a day doesn't go by without at least one article or news storyon the Internet. Whether the story concerns virtual reality programs from PARCor the confluence of video, audio, and text via computer in the home, or justold fashioned get-rich-quick scams in cyberspace, news stories abound. And whynot? Once communication lines were opened, the rush to gain knowledge, toexchange information instantaneously, or just to send some informal messagesto colleagues was unstoppable.     Dealing with this momentum of information exchange will color all of1996. The scientific and technical information community, of which I am apart, will embrace new credos in each of its sectors. Authors will find newchannels of scientific communication; primary publishers will digitize anddisseminate or die; secondary services, perhaps most vulnerable, will need torediscover how to link reader and writer by some other means than abstractsand indexes; libraries will be forced to find a means of controllingtechnology, lest they are eroded from within; and readers and researchers willdiscover that the systems' "walls of silence" have come down, but that thereare no instant answers in this new digital world. In short, not what it usedto be.     The year 1996 will also mark, I believe, a landmark, because of thecurrent breadth and pace of change in the information industry. Soonresearchers and managers will be able to roam the world seeking informationindependent of time and space. Whether in an airplane over London or on acommuter train outside Chicago, you'll be able to send a voice mail message,a paper copy, or even a video image to your office in New York or Tokyo witha simple effort. A wider variety of files will be available online anddigitally 24 hours a day, accessible anywhere in the world. The freedom andbreadth of universal access may be the most significant benefits of the newcommunication and information technologies of our age. Access, retrieval, anddisplay technologies will dwarf the capabilities of today, making the faxmachine seem as quaint as the manual typewriter.     The final shift in this new information world--the shift ofleadership--will be initiated in 1996. Information production anddissemination, once a labor-intensive task, is fast becoming a processinvolving two parts. The production of knowledge will be open to many, astechnology lowers the barriers of entry to the traditional publishingbusiness. Dissemination, however, will be a capital-intensive business,reserved for the few who can afford to support global, nonstop markets. Thetraditional mainstays of the scientific and technical informationinfrastructure--the technical societies, governments, the not-for-profitassociations--will be greatly disadvantaged in this capital-hungry enterpriseand will yield their leadership positions to the multinational, publicly held,global communications companies now emerging.     The year 1996 will mark the passing of these and other mantles, and afterthat . . . well, you know, the future is not what it used to be.     Bela Hatvani     President     SilverPlatter Information, Inc.     The year 1996 will see an impressive growth in electronic publishing anddistribution. We are encouraging and, more importantly, facilitating thisgrowth through our ERL Technology. With ERL, we are not only broadening thepossibilities for access to electronic information, but we are enablingpartners to publish their own ERL-compliant documents through our PartnerPublishing Program. We will expand this program dramatically in 1996, enablingpublishers throughout the world to bring up their own publications inERL-compliant form.     We will continue to work with our partners by equipping them with thetools that will enable them to create an ordered Worldwide Digital Library onthe Internet. Our program for document management will link the magnificentcompendiums of bibliographic reference files that we distribute for over 100major information providers to full-text documents in a methodical way throughthe Internet, through direct dial to document sources, through fax, andthrough other methods.     We will come out with beta releases of the World Integrated Library ofDocuments (WILD thing). This project is focused on creating pieces ofinteroperating digital library technology that will enable our collaboratingpartners to co-create with SilverPlatter the first of many embryonic andinterconnected digital libraries, which will exploit our base informationstore and which will also allow publishers and technology providers to extendthis base.     We will continue to serve our library and end-user customers withhassle-free products and services. We will be releasing the Search Advisor,which enables information intermediaries to put their search strategies intoscripts to allow end users to ask simple questions from a simple interface andget accurate results.     This industry is just beginning. We are about to see a sustainedexplosion that will continue to grow the industry in a creative and chaoticway. It is an exciting time for all involved.     Deborah M. Hull     Chief Operating Officer     Ovid Technologies, Inc.     The year 1995 saw the proliferation of a powerful new model forinformation retrieval--the World Wide Web. In spite of its drawbacks, it hascaptured the popular imagination in a way that no technology has done sincethe introduction of the PC. Just as the PC ultimately transformed the workingworld even without living up to its touted potential in the home, the Web willchange forever the way that information retrieval is perceived. As adistributed, client/server model that is easy to use and develop, the Webmakes manifest that information retrieval is for anyone, that it cannot becontained within one collection or product, and that adherence to standardscan bring a certain unity and presence to what has previously been astaggering variety of products for specialized audiences. The many, and evenserious, information retrieval problems of the Web will not put this genieback in the bottle.     At Ovid Technologies, we have already been fully committed to standardsin our products, including Z39.50, SGML, and the NISO Thesaurus. We areembracing not just the Web but the information retrieval model it implies. Ourclient/server system architecture and all our products are designed formaximum flexibility in fitting into existing environments--locally at aresearch site or remotely via our online service. More importantly, we havebuilt a rich infrastructure for linkages from our databases to other databaseproducts; to local OPAC holdings via Z39.50; to expanded product views viainternal Ovid links (for example, linking all the articles from one issue intoa table of contents or linking a document to one similar to it); and to otherservices via URLs. An increasingly important linkage for us is to full textfrom bibliographic records; between the various structural elements of fulltext; or between cited references and full text. We see our growing full-textcollections as increasingly important in the "post-Web" world, where the endresult of a search is naturally expected to be a document rather than acitation.     Although in 1996 many companies will be scrambling to make products andservices on the Web, those of us already in the information retrieval businesswill do well to think creatively about bringing the advantages of our type ofproducts into the simplified, graphic world of the Web. I think that 1996 willbe the year in which information retrieval goes mainstream, affecting even the"traditional" research models.     Tim Collins     Division General Manager and Vice President     EBSCO Publishing     Many key issues of 1996 will relate to the struggle to effectively usetechnology to integrate numerous products and services into comprehensivesolutions that allow information professionals to provide service to users atlower costs.     We will see this with the way information from periodicals is searchedand delivered. Librarians will no longer need to contract with differentvendors for each of the following services: subscription service, currentawareness service, periodical abstract/index databases, online search andretrieval service, and document delivery service. Companies such as EBSCOoffer services that allow librarians to provide access to table of contents,abstract, ASCII full text, and image full-text data through one search. Theservices provide the ability to order documents or to learn where in thelibrary these documents are located if they are not available electronically.     Electronic access to databases will become even more distributedthroughout organizations. More searching will be done directly from facultyand employee desktops and less will be done from central libraries. Schoollibraries will provide searching through larger networks in the library, andthe extension of searching to the classroom will become more prevalent. Publiclibraries will offer online services through their growing networks and willbegin to provide access to more computers dialing in from homes.     The World Wide Web will become more and more prevalent and will emerge asa legitimate source for accessing quality commercial data throughsophisticated search and retrieval software. It will mature and no longer havethe reputation as a fun place to find interesting, but not critical, freedata. Libraries will begin to find themselves competing with consumer onlineservices and Web sites for the attention of their constituents. Carefulcomparison of data being offered by these sources will become critical.     Primary publishers of consumer titles will experiment with ways toprovide their data inexpensively online to the masses and will look toadvertisers to cover the costs of online service providers much the way theycover the cost of printers and typesetters now.     A significant number of primary publishers of scientific, technical, andmedical data will cross the threshold and make their data availableelectronically. Many pricing models will be used but, by the end of the year,some models will emerge as being viable for the long run.     Customizing services to the unique needs of individual users will becomea more important component of success. As companies struggle to providecomprehensive solutions that merge multiple products and services it will bea challenge to include the customization that each separate product andservice provided when it was offered alone.     The provision of training and support to library professionals on the useof these services will be an important factor in the purchase decisions atsmall libraries as well as for large state-wide projects.     Competition will be fierce among information service providers as theystruggle to establish or maintain their place in this rapidly changingindustry. Those that will be successful will be the ones that integratetechnology effectively and provide practical solutions at reasonable prices.     Joe Bremner     President     Database Development     As always, there seem to be more questions than answers. It is good tosee that the publishing industry--not the telephone or computer companies--isabsorbing the electronic information business. Significant acquisitions havebeen made by companies like Wolters Kluwer, Thomson, Reed/Elsevier,Knight-Ridder, and Pearson.     In the last Commerce Department survey, the U.S. publishing industry andrelated services had total revenues of nearly $200 billion, while theelectronic information industry (separately classified by the CommerceDepart-ment) was approximately $15 billion. There was no way that this $200billion industry was going to sit by and watch someone else steal itsfranchise.     We have argued for many years that the ascendancy and growth of the"online business" was really a publishing anomaly that would be absorbed intothe publishing industry once its capabilities and potential capabilitiesmatured and were recognized. Those capabilities include its being a naturalsuccessor to the structures in place in the publishing industry forresearching, assembling, editing, presenting, and distributing all types ofinformation.     The publishing industry understands these processes better than any ofthe other competitors who are scrambling to define the multimedia future. Thedepth and diversity of the skills present in the publishing industry willchallenge the ability of computer or telecommunications players; it is not atall clear that the rapidly conglomerating "entertainment" or "multimedia"conglomerates will have significant scale or distribution advantages.     Why? Well, of course, it's the Internet, which, stated another way, is anopen network that provides a kind of access to distribution for small players,a development that may be unique in industrial history.     What does this view of the future mean? One of the significant effects oftechnology in this environment will be continued disintermediation ofaggregators and distributors. In an open network environment, how does onedefine where WESTLAW ends and America Online begins? Given the passable jobthat existing intelligent information agents do, and imagining how much morepowerful their successors will be, won't these tools further level thedistribution playing field--the open Internet-based playing field?     Do the fits and starts of the Microsoft Network reveal a lack ofstrategic "publishing" skills mentioned above? If the playing field remainsopen, and the technology exists, publishers will create their own electronicenvironments, target their traditional audiences--programmers, pilots, brides,bankers, business managers--and bring them to that environment, using all ofthe skills that helped them "own" those audiences in the past, and they maynot need Microsoft or other online services to help them.     What will this mean for players like UMI, NEXIS, and ISI? Will they beable to develop value-added services to maintain their holds on distributionrights granted by publishers?     The only thing I am certain of is that life will be exciting.     Dr. K. Wayne Smith     President and CEO     OCLC Online Computer Library Center Inc.     In 1996, we expect to continue pursuing our public purposes of furtheringaccess to the world's information and of reducing information costs. We willalso continue to aggressively pursue our goals of making OCLC's servicesavailable around the clock, around the world.     In 1996, we believe the OCLC community of 21,000 libraries in the U.S.and 61 other countries will be thinking most about the following:     1)   The Internet, the World Wide Web, and Web software will continue to          grab headlines and shift paradigms. They will impact planning for          library services at the local, regional, national, and international          levels.     2)   Libraries will increasingly bring their organizational and retrieval          skills to bear on the Internet. They will start helping people find          information on the Internet.     3)   Libraries will continue to move closer to their dream of an          electronic virtual library that integrates technical services,          public services, archiving, and other library functions into a          unified whole. More library patrons will log on to their libraries          from their homes or offices.     4)   As the pace of technological change quickens, the gap between          information haves and have-nots will continue to grow. Libraries          already recognize this growing gap and will try to narrow it.     5)   Electronic scholarly publishing will begin to come of age in 1996.          There will be a critical mass of electronic journals available from          publishers that will provide libraries with new service and          collection options and readers with a new way of accessing journal          information.     OCLC will be active on all of these fronts in 1996, from developing aJava interface for its electronic journals to leading 185 libraries in anInternet resource cataloging project, to offering financial subsidies forlibraries to trade in their older workstations for state-of-the-art machines,to providing new products and services that will further reduce libraries'costs.     The OCLC community will mark the 25th anniversary of the OCLC OnlineUnion Catalog (OLUC) in 1996. With its 34 million records, some 600 millionlocation listings, and its more than 4,000 years of recorded knowledge in 360languages, the OLUC has become a unique information resource highly valued byscholars and researchers around the globe. It is a good example of what ispossible and probable on the emerging, global, digital, information highway.     Patrick J. Tierney     President and CEO     Knight-Ridder Information, Inc.     Organizational reengineering, converging technologies, and globaleconomics are inexorably reshaping the way organizations use information.Managers must recognize that productivity is key, and no single informationproduct can satisfy all the requirements of all information users.     Increasingly, information specialists, our core customers, are redefiningthe function of the information center to make the best use of newtechnologies, to build and manage organizational knowledge, and to deliverinformation throughout the organization. They are being asked to serve asconsultants as well as researchers; to provide a "virtual library," available24 hours a day to the desktop; to synthesize information from both internaland external sources, including the Internet; and to deliver it to theircorporate clients. At the same time, their clients are becoming moreinformation-savvy and are placing ever greater demands on them as informationspecialists.     To meet their needs, Knight-Ridder Information is focusing its efforts onproviding integrated information solutions -- those that enable thesespecialists to gather and deliver information quickly on an enterprise-widebasis. One key product, KR ProBase, was introduced in Europe and North Americain 1995. Its familiar Windows-based interface gives searchers fast, easy,point-and-click access to the outstanding collection of DataStardatabases--without learning a new search language. In 1996, we will extendthat convenience to the DIALOG service as well.     The Internet has become the hot new medium for communications, and moreand more, it is an advertising-based medium, which will have a dramatic impacton the future of services developed for it. At the same time, the "Intranet,"or internal network utilizing Internet technologies, is emerging as a way tobuild information sharing systems, which can blend internal and externalinformation sources for use throughout the organization.  Taking advantage ofthe opportunity to bring information solutions to the desktop, we areintroducing the first two products in a new line of end-user services: KRBusinessBase for the Windows operating system and KR ScienceBase for the WorldWide Web. And to ensure network-based document delivery, our 1995 acquisitionof The UnCover Company will permit us to significantly enhance our KRSourceOne delivery service.     The changes we are observing are not restricted to the U.S. Astechnological advancements circle the globe, there is an increasing worldwidedemand for easy access to local information, and in many cases we seetechnologies such as wireless communications that leapfrog the existinginfrastructure. Our KR Global-Reach service was developed to meet this need.Introduced in 1995 and rapidly expanding, KR GlobalReach uses the Internet tobring vital regional data to countries around the world, in their localbusiness languages.     As we enter 1996, we are at the dawn of a new era of customerexpectations for information services. To meet those expectations, informationservice pro-viders must go beyond our traditional offerings to create anintegrated suite of new and innovative tools that help informationprofessionals extend their reach into all functions of their organizations andhelp information users increase their overall productivity.     Tom Hogan     President     Information Today, Inc.     When I was younger, nothing used to turn me off to a discussion more thanwhen one of my seniors would say that something had already been tried ordone. Using a past experience to win an argument seemed irrelevant and unfair.They were saying, in effect, that "There is nothing new under the sun," whichcan destroy one's sense of adventure and discovery.     However, now that I've been in the electronic information business forover 25 years, I find myself in the position of feeling compelled to recall afew pieces of history in order to justify my predictions for the future.     In the mid-1970s, after a few years of relative obscurity, onlineservices such as DIALOG and SDC Orbit began to assert themselves as viabletools for information delivery. In 1975 I happened to be in charge ofmarketing at Data Courier, and I remember online royalties for our ABI/Informdatabase reaching $40,000 that year, an amount we considered quite good.Today, UMI, which now owns that database, enjoys online royalties in themillions.     But the story doesn't end there. Because the word spread that there wasmoney to be made in online information, a kind of gold rush mentality sweptover the information publishing community, and databases of every shape, size,and subject began appearing on one online service or another. Puttingsomething up online seemed to be the straightest path to fame and fortune.     What people tended to forget, however, was that online users wereactually being asked to pay for the information they retrieved, and it turnedout that putting something up online didn't make it irresistible. There weremany more databases that produced very little revenue or failed altogetherthan there were success stories such as ABI/Inform.     Similarly, in the late '80s and early '90s, CD-ROM technology burst uponthe scene, and the gold rush began again. I wonder how many CD-ROM discs aregathering dust in publishers' warehouses because people simply didn't want orneed the information they contain, no matter how attractive the technology wasor is.     We now find ourselves faced with a new technology, the Internet, and thefrenzy has started all over again. Getting something up on the Internet,establishing a site on the World Wide Web--surely this is the path to fame andfortune in the mid-'90s and beyond.     Somehow I doubt it.     What I really think will happen, and here comes my prediction, is thatthe zillion or so Internet users will come to understand in 1996 that reallyvaluable, accurate, reliable information comes with a price tag--just as italways did in print, on microfilm, on CD-ROM, or online. Solid intellectualproperty costs money. And if it costs money, then it better serve a real need.Marshall McLuhan notwithstanding, the medium isn't the message. The message isthe message.     Therefore, I hereby declare 1996 to be the "Year of Content." (Accent onthe first syllable of "content.") And my advice to publishers is to first makesure you've got something people really want, regardless of the medium ofdelivery, before investing time and money in the technology du jour. Theconsumer is wiser than we may like to believe.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION TODAY via NewsNetJanuary 1996QUINT'S ONLINE: Censorship as Marketing Opportunity     By Barbara Quint     What this country needs is some good five-cent censors.     Before you report me to the ACLU or have me barred from the next dinnerdance of the American Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee,let me explain. On second thought, go ahead and report me. It's a freecountry. I can say whatever I want. On third thought, maybe I will amplify myremarks. Expensive market studies have shown that readers of leading tradepress publications dislike one-paragraph columns. See how quickly commercialinterest can affect political correctness!     Harry Cohn, the much maligned movie mogul who founded ColumbiaPictures--and of whom, observing the large crowd at Cohn's funeral, comic RedSkelton remarked, "Just goes to show. Give the people what they want andthey'll turn out."--anyway, Harry Cohn used to drive producers and directorsnuts with his somewhat vulgar test for whether a picture worked or not. Itconcerned an itch in his posterior regions. Regardless of the anatomicallocation, any good marketer or product designer better have an innate gift forrecognizing rashes and other allergic reactions when it comes to consumers.The best and most successful products scratch itches, wherever they may occur.     Censorship is an itch of long standing, an itch that crawled out of thecaves with the human animal, an itch that won't go away. Considered on itsbroadest level, maybe it shouldn't go away. Review your own lives, especiallythose of you over a certain age (and any age is a certain age). Don't you findyourself almost as appreciative of some of the things you have never known,never heard, never thought of as you are of the things that you have? How manyof us shake our heads and tsk-tsk at the deplorable depravities of the "othergeneration"? Of course, what each person considers depravity varies. For someit may mean ladies without hats and gloves on a public street; for others itmeans ladies of the street. Some may condemn rap music ("Albums to CommitFelonies By"), others New Age sound ("Will somebody PUH-LEEZ shut thatelevator door?!").     Basically most people want to engineer silences as well as sounds.Perhaps we all should be intellectual and spiritual "tabulae rasae," cooldudes open to all experiences. Then again, maybe many of us are already doubleparked, too busy with the problems at hand to reflect on problemsunrecognized. Or maybe our personal learning styles only absorb and createtrue knowledge in a quiet corner huddled around a limited and manageable arrayof data. Hurricanes of data can lead even the chronically curious to shut thedoor on an open mind--at least until the winds die down.     And so people turn to censorship, to systems that shut off informationflow. The more massive the data flow and the more stress factors related tothe data content, the more the censorship reaction occurs. Can we stop it? No.Should we try to stop it? Maybe not.A P.C. DISCLAIMER     A brief pause for political correctness. In this column, my definition ofcensorship is very broad. The dark side of censorship usually occurs whenpeople try to control not just what they themselves experience, but whatothers can experience as well. Although people may have a right to not listen,to not research, to not have to argue their positions, they don't necessarilyhave the right to force on others the same silence or to deny others theinformation needed to satisfy personal goals and beliefs.     Borderline areas occur when one person does have legitimateresponsibility for the minds of others, such as parents for children orteachers for pupils. As a rule, the closer the monitor and the monitored cometo a peer relationship, the less the legitimacy of the control. So parents of2-year-olds have more right to control the perceived reality of their progenythan parents of 12-year-olds, and practically none over 22-year-olds.Kindergarten teachers have more sway than college professors. Employers mayeven have some rights over the minds of employees--at least when they'repaying the employees for their "thought time" and for the information servicesthey use to support the thinking. (Has anyone seen that America Onlinecommercial where the guy laughs that his boss doesn't know he's really playinggames at work? Censor!!)     The demands of alternative values or alternative scenarios for reachingthe same ends can also complicate issues of censorship. People opposecensorship because they do not want truth silenced, but people supportcensorship because they do not want truth buried under a deluge of lies,half-truths, and noise. Even ardent defenders of academic freedom, forexample, will often still endure the "censorship" of the peer review standardsof scholarship.     Democratic governments have longstanding barriers erected byconstitutional law against controlling the minds and mouths of the individualsthe governments serve. Most protections against censorship focus on governmentas censor, probably because of the inequality of power between individuals and"city halls." However, a government's obligation to protect the lives of itsconstituents elicits constitutionally valid exemptions, as in the classicmetaphor of "crying 'Fire!' in a crowded theater."FILTERS NOT CENSORS     Let's focus on "authorized censors," those authorized by the very bestauthorities--individual users shaping their own information environments. Whensearchers go shopping, they often look for what vendors won't provide them aswell as for what they will. Rather than censorship products, perhaps we needa new name for these "wanted-information-only" services. What aboutinformation filters? Some information filter services follow traditionalproduct lines, yet perhaps use more high-tech production modes. Othersconstitute software that the individual can apply or ignore to suit particularinformation flow problems. Others form the basis for developing newinformation environments.     Of course, all database designers censor merely by setting rules ofinclusion and exclusion and defining scopes of coverage. The Internet may havebrought back the '60s, tie-dye morality (or amorality, depending on your worldview), but even the most complacent among us would have to admit thatcommercial online sources represent The Establishment. Actually some databaseshave biases that can be useful. Look at PR Newswire, the collection ofelectronic press releases, the "company line online," so to speak.     Frankly, PR Newswire often serves as a useful filter. For one thing, it'shonest about its biases. Business articles that appear in newspapers or thetrade press usually invoke some journalistic credibility, although they oftenconsist only of rehashed press releases. Then again, sometimes searchers don'twant critical, investigative reporting; they just want the official line. Andsometimes knowledgeable experts get too cute, and the official line turns outto be the truth after all. In any case, it's convenient to have a databasethat filters for the "official" version of reality.     Electronic mail management software has grown more sophisticated as thethreat to users' time schedules has grown more dire. Any e-mail and listservuser who travels out of town for a week or more can tell you of the coldterror awaiting on return to base. Why do you think they sell so many laptopcomputers? They're defense mechanisms from online overload. "Post-Boolean"search engines in some e-mail managers can now rank messages by relevance,allowing users to set priority levels. Online e-mail managers can sometimes dothe same. Do users ever miss anything important? Maybe, but some users maydecide it's better than losing large chunks of every workday.     It's not only e-mail that needs filters. Many voicemail systems offer theoption of ranking messages. And why do you think they put speakers on youranswering machine? Of course, none of us would ever be rude enough to not pickup the phone until we identified the caller and maybe the reason for the call.Naah!     The Internet's propensity for electronic frontier freedom has led to theintroduction of "real" censors. Trying to avoid lawsuits, bad press, andCongressional virtue, vendors have started supplying rating and blockingtools, like the V-chip, against "naughty bits." As the Internet continues itsinevitable march, the need to categorize and rank content will increase.Already services such as the McKinley Group and Point Communications promiseto identify the "best" and most reliable Web sites.     As television and the home computer overlap, new product opportunitiesmay arise. Frankly, cable television, not to mention direct satellitebroadcasting, is already out of hand. Even with a "TV Guide," you cannotidentify everything you could view at any given moment. As an occasionalC-SPAN binger, I was overjoyed to see a forum from them on the new MicrosoftNetwork (MSN). Imagine my dismay when it turned out that they only loaded theprevious day's schedule. What the heck good is that? But if I had an onlineguide to all of the C-SPAN schedule along with all of the other cable and freetelevision broadcasts, I could start to craft an infotainment product of myown. If the computer could turn the television and/or VCR on and off, theonline guide could form the basis for filtering mechanisms.     The other day I saw a rather rowdy panel on C-SPAN where several majortelevision producers pounded on a congressman advocating the V-chip. Theproducers didn't want any rating system for violence, electronic or otherwise,because they think it will deter advertiser support and effectively censorsome shows off the air because of removed funding. On the other hand, thebluntest opponent of the V-chip inadvertently admitted his own censoringhabits. Children under 5 in his household cannot watch any television. Theycan only watch videotapes from Disney. His personal parental programming gotme to wondering. What happens after age 6?     When I was 6 and 7 and 8 and so forth, television operated under a rigidbroadcasting code that only allowed the pure of heart and mouth on the air.Now that's not going to happen these days, and maybe it's for the best. On theother hand, I'm not sure that Bart Simpson or the Terminator is desirable asa universal role model for impressionable youth either. Maybe parents couldprogram restricted access during the daylight hours or when they're not home.American Movie Classics or Turner Classic Movies show flicks filmed underequally restrictive codes. Nickelodeon shows old television and kid programs.For youthful viewing, we could add program selections from PBS stations,Discovery Channel, TLC (The Learning Channel), and maybe some news broadcasts.     Of course, some people would put a Boolean NOT in front of all thoseselections and turn their filters the opposite direction. Hey! It's a freecountry.     Regardless of the product produced, information vendors should keepmonitoring users for situations that lead to complaints about too much datanoise or too much of the wrong kind of information stimuli. Battered consumersare a market opportunity. Remember, "silence is golden."

Three major services--DataTimes, Profound, and NewsNet--receivedextensive makeovers, involving colorful GUIs, new pricing schemes, and moredatabases. This occurred in a climate of anticipation around new marketentrants, such as Microsoft Network, which has content from many leadingbusiness database producers, and forthcoming services from AT&T and MCI. Amidall of this hype, some of the other established services may appear to be alittle behind the curve. Even venerable DIALOG looks like it has some catchingup to do.     In recent years DIALOG, with its pricing scheme that still dependsheavily on connect rate and its lack of a flashy, graphics-laden GUI, haslagged behind some industry trends. Nevertheless, when it comes down tocontent, DIALOG is still looking over its shoulder at the followers. Althoughothers may proclaim themselves as the "leading" or "most comprehensive"business service, DIALOG is unrivaled or, at least, unsurpassed. Thedefinition of the "best" business service is in the eye of the beholder, butby several definitions, DIALOG remains top dog. For its coverage of companiesand industries, for its depth of U.S. and international information, and forits collection of textual, numeric, and directory files, DIALOG can make thestrongest claim for being the most comprehensive online business service.     Three new business databases announced on DIALOG during the fallstrengthen its position. Two of them, D&B European Financial Records andKompass Eastern Europe, enrich DIALOG's large collection of company databases.The third, International Business Directory, fits with DIALOG's strengths inboth business and sci-tech information.NEW DATA FROM D&B     DIALOG and Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) have long been one of the strongestonline service/database producer partnerships. DIALOG was the first externalsupplier for D&B and remains a major third party host for D&B databases. Thenewest database, D&B European Financial Records, extends DIALOG's set ofdetailed financial data to non-U.S. companies. European Financial Records iscomparable to Duns Financial Records Plus, which contains financials for overa million U.S. businesses, nearly all of which are privately held.     European Financial Records (EFR) covers 2.4 million businesses in 13Western European nations. Those most heavily represented are the U.K., France,the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, and Italy, with smaller numbers of recordsfrom Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Andorra, and San Marino.     The data in an EFR record is similar to that found in Duns FinancialRecords Plus:     --   Company profile with name, address, phone, primary and secondary SIC          codes, officers, number of employees, banks, premises, and year          started     --   Corporate family, including subsidiaries with percentage of          ownership, branches, and immediate parent     --   Financials (including sales, profits, net worth, assets,          liabilities, debts, and capital), assets and liabilities broken down          into over a dozen items, and three years of annual totals expressed          both in local currency and in U.S. dollars     --   Thirteen key ratios, with three-year annual totals     Most of these fields are searchable, so that a record can be customizedto almost any desired set of fields. The ability to pick and choose among dataelements is welcome in this expensive database--a full record is $75 andconnect rate is $90/hr.     EFR must be used with the same caveats that apply to DFR and other D&Bdatabases. Many company records are not complete and may have only summaryfinancial information. Figures may be D&B estimates when data from the companyitself are absent. Financials are also based on annual totals, which may notreveal the company's current situation.KOMPASS LINE EXPANDS     European company information is also the focus of the latest in theKompass series. Unlike the D&B files, which concentrate on financial data, theKompass databases emphasize product information with detailed product listingsfrom thousands of companies worldwide.     The Kompass databases are produced by an international consortium ofbusiness directory publishers. Other Kompass databases cover Western Europe,the U.K., and the Asia/Pacific region, as well as several individualcountries. They concentrate on manufacturing and industrial firms that sellbusiness-to-business, including related service companies. Kompass EasternEurope lists 100,000 companies from Russia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Croatia, and the Yugoslav region.     A Kompass record provides a brief company profile containing name,address, phone, fax, type of business (manufacturer, distributor, etc.),industry sector, sales, number of employees, principal officers, and summaryparent/subsidiary information. Product line information is more specific, witha thorough listing of the company's products and services. They are arrangedaccording to the Universal Commodity System, a classification widely used inEurope. The system classifies 45,000 different products and services, allowingfor precise description of a company's product line.     Most fields in a Kompass record are searchable. Product terms arearranged hierarchically so that a search on a broad product class willretrieve all of the more specific subclasses within it. Befitting Kompass'wordly flavor, records can be obtained in English, German, French, Spanish, orItalian; product names can be searched in any of the languages. The recordsfor each country are updated annually on a rotating basis; thus, at any timea given record may be substantially out of date. Kompass Eastern Europe isexclusively on DIALOG, where it joins several other Kompass files.TECHNOLOGIES FOR TRANSFER     The International Business Directory is misnamed, since it is actually adirectory of technologies for transfer from both profit and nonprofitorganizations. It is based on the The World Bank of Licensable Technology, adirectory produced by the Canadian Industrial Innovation Centre.     The database lists over 26,000 technologies that can be licensed inmanufacturing, chemicals, electronics, medicine, agriculture, energy,construction, and communications. Technology descriptions are provided byhundreds of licensing organizations including companies, research labs,universities, and government agencies. The directory is international, withinput from over three dozen countries, although three-quarters of the contentcomes from the U.S., the U.K., and Canada.     Each record briefly describes the technology, its uses and advantages,development stage, patent number, and licensing terms. Not all records havethis complete description; many have only summary descriptions and may lackother record elements. Records also contain supplier information, industrysector names, and a contact person. Most record fields are searchable.     The International Business Directory is DIALOG exclusive. As a mixedbusiness and technical database, it is a small but useful addition to DIALOG'sgreat collections in each area. DIALOG's status as the leading businessservice may be subject to honest dispute, but as the best common source forbusiness and sci-tech data, there is no question.

At the time, it was the kind of announcement thatsurprised many people, considering the amount of work the project wouldrequire. But now two occurrences make West's announcement even more memorable.     Six months after the announcement, the legal industry is beginning to seethe results of West's labors. These results are worth some examination.LEGAL INDUSTRY INTEREST IN THE INTERNET IS GROWING     In six months the legal industry's attention to the Internet has gonefrom marginal interest on the part of a few practicing attorneys to somethingmuch more significant. How significant? An anecdotal survey of large lawoffices finds that, of the dozen or so contacted, all either had home pages,were contemplating home pages, or at the very least had Internet access. Forsome their presence may be limited to simple access through a local Internetprovider. But if you ever get on the Internet with a World Wide Web (WWW)browser, you'll find that the legal industry's Internet presence is takingsome interesting turns.     At the 1995 ABA TechShow, the Internet presentations were among the mostattended sessions. At the time (March 1995), over 50 medium or large law firmswere listed as having WWW home pages. Today, even barring West's announcedhome page development, the number is too great to count and still growing.     Why are law offices expressing an interest in WWW home page development?     "It allows people in the general public to obtain information about afirm without any barriers," says Joe Lester, a Bloomington, Minnesota,attorney who offers a Web site focusing on business and technology law(http://www.mnlaw.com). Like many other Internet observers, Lester points totwo important features that make an Internet presence worth considering,particularly for law offices.     Once a home page is located, most provide the researcher with a varietyof information they can't find anyplace else: links to examples of theattorney's work or links to related home pages or subjects that can be veryuseful.     "It's an alternative to going to a printed directory," explains Lester."You can [do a] search, based upon categories of information, that would leadyou to a variety of firms, and then from there, link into more specific typesof information that may or may not be of interest."     Another reason Internet observers like Lester are pointing to theimportance of an Internet presence is because of the advertising/marketingexposure. "For the firm it is extremely high-value marketing. The firm canprovide useful information, at a very low cost, that's much more accessiblethan traditional print advertising or directories."WEST'S HOME PAGE PROGRAM     Given the growing importance of having an Internet presence, many firmsare trying to figure out how to get started, without realizing they mayalready have a WWW home page.     According to a press release dated August 3, 1995, West Publishing was inthe midst of creating "home pages for all of more than 800,000 profilescontained within West's Legal Directory (WLD) . . . West Publishing willcreate a WWW home page for each of the private practice attorneys, law firms,corporate counsel, government attorneys, and other legal professionals listedon WLD. Each home page is accessible free of charge to users browsing the WWWand to clients interested in gathering information on legal professionals."     Part of West's continued development includes improving the e-mail fieldfor each WLD profile so individuals have easier access to Internet e-mail. Andeach professional's WLD profile will have an Internet URL field. The URL fieldwill link the user to the firm or attorney home page. In this way WLD willbecome a locator for each attorney's home page.     The preceding commits to a significant amount of home page development.Unfortunately, in many cases those home pages will not reach their fullpotential. Unless attorneys take an interest in their home pages, they won'tprovide any more information than what's already noted in their WLD listing.But it's worth noting that West's press release went on to state that "inaddition, West is offering an opportunity for law firms to customize thedesign and information contained with their Internet home page."     For a sample of an informative home page design, consider the law officesof Briggs and Morgan (http://www.briggs.com). Internet users accessing thissite first view an introductory page like the one depicted in Figure 1.     The introductory screen contains little more than the Briggs and Morganlogo and a phone number. But notice the reference to "Briggs and Morgan's WebPages." The plural is significant, because if you scroll through Briggs'introductory screen you'll find it's actually very brief. In fact, the entirehome page takes up approximately three screens. But each Briggs screen ispacked with a lot of information, and the details can be acquired by simplypointing and clicking.     Anyone who has spent much time browsing the Internet will recognize thisdesign. The beauty of the Briggs page is in its simple design and in the wayit leaves further perusal to the browser. For example, if I wanted to view thebiographical listing for a Briggs attorney, I could simply click on theProfiles icon (third from left near the middle of the screen--see Figure 2).That takes you to a list of Briggs and Morgan Attorney Profiles, whichidentifies every Briggs attorney in alphabetical order. If you want to seemore information on a particular attorney, simply click on the person's name,and you're taken to the full WLD listing for the attorney.     Similarly, if I was interested in learning more about Briggs' practice,I could click on About or Practice. If I wanted to learn more about theadvantages of Briggs' law firm I could click on Advantages. And if I wanted toview some of their publications, I could click on Alerts or OtherPublications.YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR     How much does it cost to get West's assistance in creating a customizedhome page on the Internet? According to West, it depends on what you want tolist. But general costs can be anywhere from $1,500 per year (for solopractitioners) to several thousand dollars a year for a large law firm with avery detailed listing. The price really depends on firm size and on thecomplexity, layout, and content of the home page design.     However, if a law firm compared the prices of outsourcing or setting upa home page itself (design of home page, establishing themselves as a WWWsite, etc.), the costs would easily exceed $30,000. Similarly, if a firmoutsourced the design of a home page and rented space with a local Internetprovider (to house the home page) the approximate annual costs could be asmuch as $9,000.     West offers an extremely comprehensive service, guaranteeing what itcalls 7/24: The home pages are available seven days a week, 24 hours a day.West also offers a directory that can be searched in a variety of complexways, enabling users to find home pages for attorneys they would otherwisehave to find through other, weaker search engines.     Interested users can view a demonstration firm site on the Internet.Tennyson & Keye, a fictitious law firm West created as an example of its WWWhome page services, can be found at http://demo.wld.com. If you have the rightequipment, you can even view the Tennyson & Keye home page's videopresentation.     One surmises that West is offering all firms a home page as both anenhancement of its directory and as a way to give those attorneys notcurrently participating with a full page in the directory more enticement todo so.     Nothing in life is free, but if you compare the price of going out andcreating your own home page (a process I'm in the middle of--and I expect it'sgoing to cost around $50 per month, which doesn't include the actual pagecreation), West's deal looks very good.CONCLUSION     1995 was a year of both remarkable news and phenomenal growth on theInternet. On occasion, both of these phenomena intersected. West'sannouncement regarding home page development was the kind of intersection mostattorneys appreciated.     Providing home pages for the attorneys listed in WLD not only makesmarketing sense for WLD but also presents a great marketing opportunity forevery attorney practicing today.

By Peter Jacso     Survival instinct, that's what will drive them. CD-ROM drivemanufacturers (and CD-ROM database publishers) have been under a great deal ofpressure lately from all sides. The phenomenal growth of Internet access, theplummeting price of hard disks with gigabytes of capacity, the incrediblysuccessful ZIP drives of Iomega, the launching of the phase-change dualtechnology (PD) discs, and the promise of super-high-density discs promptedmany industry observers to write obituaries for CD-ROM.Count me out. I still believe in the feasibility of CD-ROMs. There have beenconstant improvements in CD-ROM technology. We saw some of this in 1995; morewill come in 1996.TRANSFER RATE IMPROVEMENTS     CD-ROM drives had been tagging along at the 150 KB/second transfer ratefor quite a time, until the first double-speed (2x) drives--transferring 300KB of data per second--appeared on the market in 1992. Single-speed driveswere acceptable for text and audio databases. Single-speed, however, turnedout to be inappropriate for animation and the first video clips, even if theywere of postage stamp size. This ushered in first the double-speed and, in1993, the unusual triple-speed (3x) drives from NEC. They were followed in1994 by the first quadruple-speed (4x) drives and another odd drive, thequintuple-speed from NEC. There are other drives with odd transfer rates, suchas the 4.5-speed Toshiba, Panasonic, and Plextor models, and the 4.4-speedPioneer.     The rate at which transfer speed has been increasing since 1992 has beenquite impressive. It was obvious that we wouldn't have to wait long forsextuple-speed drives, and, indeed, in 1995 they arrived from NEC, Plextor,and TEAC. Mitsumi, the number-one drive manufacturer for OEM purposes due toits low prices, has a 6x drive for less than $300 (which translates to abouta $200 OEM price). This time, Mitsumi doesn't skimp on buffer size, featuringa 128 K buffer. Toshiba demonstrated its 6.7-speed XM-3701 drives (in bothinternal and external versions) at Fall COMDEX. Why 6.7x? Because it justbreaks the 1 MB/second transfer rate and is certainly a good eye-catcher inthe ads.     Yes, you guessed right. The first 8x drive--from Diamond--just startedshipping, and NEC and Chinon plan to ship their 8x drives by the time you readthis. Others may join the fray, although I am somewhat skeptical. I wonder ifit is worth stretching the transfer rate further at this time. To achieve thisspeed, the discs must be spinning at 4,000-5,000 revolutions per minute,depending what part of the disc is being read. (Your Walkman spins the disc atabout 450 rpm, for the sake of comparison.) This generates a lot of heat,noise, and resonance, and may not result in a perceivable performanceimprovement for the user.     Though motion video could benefit from faster transfer rate, it isunlikely that there will be any multimedia titles that would include videorecorded with a view toward this 1.2 MB/second transfer rate. Title developersin 1995 still optimized their video compression for the double-speed drives(still the largest segment of CD-ROM drives). This will probably change thisyear for the annually updated or newly released titles, which are likely to beoptimized for a quad-speed, 600 KB/second transfer rate that will becomedominant in drives. Running such titles on drives sporting transfer rateshigher than quad speed is only marginally beneficial, except when files arecopied (instead of being played back) from the CD-ROM, as in the case ofinstalling program suites.     Displaying text and playing audio files from an application do not callfor a higher rate than 150 KB/second. Still images shown as a slide show evenwith recorded narration are more than happy with a quad-speed transfer rate,so why torture the mechanical parts of the drive by spinning it madly? It islike running to the bus stop even when there is no bus in sight. Much moreimportant is the balanced performance of the drive. Transfer rate is only oneelement of the drive's speed. Equally important is the access time of thedrive.ACCESS TIME IMPROVEMENTS     In order to transfer data, first the read mechanism has to get to theappropriate section. This is known as access time, measured in milliseconds(ms). This has also improved by the same factor as transfer rate over the10-year timespan, but in a reverse pattern. The first drives had 900- to1,000-ms access time (and IBM's entry to the field was via a drive with apathetically high 1,500-ms access time and a ridiculous price tag of $1,200).In a year or two, access time halved, then went down to 300- to 350-ms,stagnated there for a while, and now typically hovers around 200 ms.     A few current drives and most of the new ones that will come out thisyear sport access times of less than 200-ms. This is very important, becauseusers jump from sector to sector not only in bibliographic databases (e.g.,when a subject search yields records scattered all around the disc) but alsoin multimedia applications (e.g., when a hyperlink is activated to jump fromthe article on Hungarian music to the biography of Franz Liszt). It is ratherdisappointing (and misleading) when a headline in a good magazine that sellsabout a million copies claims that "Speedy 6x Drives Make CD-ROM Searches aSnap" ("PC World," December 1995). It is akin to saying that faster planesmake getting from New York to Boston a snap. Flying time and commuting timebetween the city and the airport together define the effective travel time.There may be some further improvements in decreasing access time but thecurrent champion, the Plextor 4Plex with a 135-msec average access time, willbe hard to beat soon.JUKEBOX IMPROVEMENTS     For quite a long time Pioneer was the only manufacturer of a jukebox(CD-ROM changer) accommodating six discs in a cartridge. Then came theseven-disc version from Mountain Network in 1994. These were a godsend forsuch megadatabases as MEDLINE or the CDMARC database from the Library ofCongress. There were significant innovations in late 1995 that will have animpact on the market in 1996.     Gateway started to include (for a $100 premium) dual-disc minijukeboxeslast year. NEC released four-disc, then seven-disc minichangers, both with aquad-speed transfer rate. They had the attractive innovation of not requiringyou to handle the entire cartridge when replacing a disc but just ejecting andinserting a single disc. The 350-ms access time, however, was a letdown. NECprobably will improve on both jukeboxes in trying to catch up with the newsix-disc Pioneer changer sporting 4.4x transfer rate and 150-ms average accesstime. With the ever increasing availability of ready reference titles, evenhome users will demand such CD-ROM changers--at a reasonable price--to holdseveral discs on tap. There are super jukeboxes storing hundreds of discsquasi-online, and these will facilitate the management of such gigantic imagedatabases as UMI's Business Periodicals Ondisc, Ovid's Core BiomedicalCollection, and other upcoming CD-ROM megadatabases.PORTABILITY IMPROVEMENTS     The most visible CD-ROM technology development in 1995 was theproliferation of CD-ROM drives built into the latest generation of notebookcomputers. There are many users, however, who don't have built-in CD-ROMdrives in their notebook computers. Until now, the best they could do was tohave a double-speed CD-ROM drive with a parallel port connector (less commonlywith a PC Card, or PCMCIA, Connector), and with a bulky AC adapter. Thisscenario is also going to change.     There were plenty of stylish, sleek, affordable, and more powerfulportable CD-ROMs at the COMDEX show, and mouth-watering promises for the firstand second quarter of 1996. PC Card-type connection is to become the norm. Thedouble-speed PacRIM Labs CyberMan CD is remarkable for including a 16-bit,44-KHz, wavetable synthesis chip and a 256 K buffer in the CD-ROM--which ismultisession-capable and also plays CD-i discs. EXP Computer, Inc. was thefirst portable (if somewhat bulky) parallel-port-based CD-ROM player that didnot require an AC adaptor. It now has the drive with a PC Card interface, andpromises to have quadruple- and sextuple-speed drives by June. These, however,will require an AC adapter because of the significant power consumption.     CNF Inc. and Chase Advanced Technologies offered the two most stylish andlightweight double-speed portable drives, the Cardport CD and the DISQ,respectively, at the very competitive price of $220 to $230. Both companiespromise a 6x portable drive by March or April. Axonix--a longtime provider ofportable CD-ROM drives for notebook computers--has both 4x and 6x variants,with an amazing 160-ms access time. Axonix is currently testing thepossibility of using the keyboard connector for power supply instead of aseparate adaptor. I am not the only one who would be overjoyed at this,because in notebook computing every ounce and extra cable count.     Even at these aggressively increasing transfer rates and moderatelydecreasing access times, CD-ROMs will remain an order of magnitude behindcurrent hard disks on both counts. But they were never meant as hard-diskreplacements. The alternative media and drives (magneto optical, phase-dual,super-density, the ZIP, and the JAZ) that seem to be threatening CD-ROMs havetheir own niche. As we shall see next month, they complement well what CD-ROMsare used for these days.     [Peter Jacso is associate professor of library and information studies atthe University of Hawaii.

If it weren't forsome of the useful content in this product it would not be worth looking at asa viable reference tool for a library. As it currently exists, "Gale BusinessResources" is a misfire that can certainly be recovered if Gale puts somedevelopment and effort into it.     The main defect in the product is its interface. Amazingly, this is aDOS-based product. Although there is a "graphical interface" through which theuser can navigate with a mouse, the buttons and screen design throughout arevery "non-standard." By this I mean that when you single-click on a button ina Windows-based software product, you will get an immediate response. In the"Gale Business Resources" product, you need to double-click on that button andeven then response is mighty slow. In a discussion with a spokesperson atGale, I learned that the intended market for this product was public andacademic libraries, who, Gale decided through its own research, were not usingWindows-based computers and were unlikely to do so until at least later thisyear. Since business and corporate libraries were not a target market, Galedecided to go with the DOS platform only. This is the main reason not to buythe product now.CONTENT IS KING     Interface aside, (but it's extremely hard to ignore it while using theproduct), some of the content and ideas that Gale has for the product havemerit. You can't go wrong with standbys like the "Encyclopedia ofAssociations," "Companies and Their Brands," "Consultants and ConsultingOrganizations Directory," and "Ward's Business Directory" (to name a few).These appear to be the gems of the product in terms of content. Others include"American Wholesalers and Distributors Directory;" "Business Rank-ingsAnnual;" "Encyclopedia of American Industry;" "Finance, Insurance and RealEstate USA;" "International Directory of Company Histories;" "ManufacturingUSA;" and "Service Industries USA."     A total of 30 volumes of Gale's business references with full text of the"Fortune 1000 Securities and Exchange Commission Reports" (on a separateCD-ROM) and the "US Industrial Outlook" are also included.     A selection of Gale products are available on CD-ROM and through onlinedatabases. For example, the "Encyclopedia of Associations" is available inboth of these formats. "Gale Business Resources" brings many of the best Galereference products together in one place. The idea is great, but so far theexecution leaves much to be desired.SEARCHING BY COMPANY, BRANDS, INDUSTRY, EXTENDED     The main screen (which never leaves you, even if you don't want to see itin the background the entire time) provides four buttons to begin yourresearch. So far, so good. But try to click on a button as you might in aWindows-based application and nothing happens. Click again and finally thesystem slogs through to the next screen. If you are used to working in DOS andhave the patience to endure yet another interface that doesn't look like orbehave like anything else you use, you might be willing to use this product.     You cannot successfully run "Gale Business Resources" in a DOS window ifyou are using Windows. The speed degrades so completely that it simply isn'tworth it.     Select the "Company" button and you are presented with a scroll-typelisting of companies to choose from. The product includes information on210,000 firms (many are divisions within a company). You have to choose acompany and then look at the brief profile to determine if it's really the oneyou want. If you choose Novell as the company, for example, you are presentedwith several listings: for Novell, Novell Inc., and Novell Corp., and it's notinitially clear which is the main one you want. You can choose to mark a rangeof companies in this screen.     Once companies have been selected, you can view the details in one ofseveral formats (Full, Brief, Mailing, or Custom). One company I chose hadonly SIC and brands listed but no mailing address information. It's hit ormiss. Move from the Company Information screen to Industry Information, andyou are offered a listing of SIC codes and descriptions for the industries inwhich the companies are engaged. Industry Information that's available formost of the industries on this disc includes Market Share Reports, Rankings,Articles & Essays, Associa-tions, and Statistics.     In my quest to find information on the software industry I viewed each ofthe items available. Market Share Reports is data culled from Gale's "MarketShare Reporter" and tends to be quite dated, especially for information onthis fast-paced industry. Rankings, too, tended to have data not much morecurrent than 1993. Articles & Essays appears to come from the "Encyclopedia ofAmerican Industry" and does not include current articles from industrypublications. For the report on software, the very latest information includedwas excerpted from a March 1994 article. Articles & Essays should moreproperly be called Industry Background and History. Current, it is not.     The Associations section is, of course, based on the "Encyclopedia ofAssociations." This has always been a great product, so it's hard to look bad,even in this clumsy interface. If your goal is to find associations, however,the books, online version, or dedicated CD-ROM version are better choices.     Statistics appear to come mainly from the "U.S. Bureau of the Census andCounty Business Patterns." This again is not current data (no fault of Gale),but Statistics might not be the right moniker for this section--again, itmight be more accurate to call this section U.S. Government IndustryStatistics.BRANDS AND THEIR COMPANIES, COMPANIES AND THEIR BRANDS     One of the more useful resources in this product is Gale's "Companies andTheir Brands," searchable through the Product and Brand Name button on themain menu. You can find information on more than 116,000 brands and 15,000products in 1,000 industries. The same procedures apply as with a companysearch. You choose a brand or product name with a scrollable list, mark theones you want, and then look at the companies with which those brands areassociated. You can then move into company or industry information asdescribed above. Again, if the interface and speed of the product were at allmodern, this could be a very useful tool for finding brand information andthen exploring the companies and industries associated with it.EXTENDED SEARCH     Ostensibly, the Extended Search option from the main menu allows you tosimultaneously search multiple fields in the "Gale Business Resources"database. As the manual suggests: ". . . you could search for all softwarecompanies in California with revenues between $100,000 and $250,000, or allcompanies with a 212 area code that manufacture ophthalmic goods." Althoughthe capability is there, the execution of the interface and the slowness ofthe search system bog down this process. The Extended Search is built arounda series of tab cards that each offer a different access point to the data. Asin other parts of the program, the response you get by clicking on these cardsis not what you would expect in a Windows application, but it sort of lookslike it and kind of behaves like it.     Extended Search "Cards" are available for Contacts (company name,officers' names, parent company, phone), Location (city, state, ZIP code, areacode), Industry (SIC, industry description), Scope (number of employees, yearfounded, revenue, stock exchange, ticker symbol), Profile (description ofbusiness, publications, seminars, and special services offered by thecompany), and Products (brand name and description). The concept is good, theunderlying information is uneven, and the search software is inadequate forthis type of sophisticated search. Too bad, it would be great otherwise.SEC REPORTS AVAILABLE     If you happen on a company for which an SEC report is available (1,00010K reports are included for top public companies), you'll see an SEC Reportbutton to choose in the company profile. Click on this and the system willprompt you to insert the second CD-ROM, which includes the full text of thesereports. Awkward, but not unreasonable.A FINAL WORD ON THE INTERFACE     An additional ongoing problem with the program is the lengthy textscreens that provide no other navigation mechanism than to continually pressthe Page Down button on the keyboard or to double-click the mouse on the tinyMore button on the screen. There is no "slider" down the side of the text boxto indicate the length of the article or to be able to quickly navigatethrough it. This makes exploration of the Articles & Essays section, forexample, quite painful.     Information can be printed and exported from any portion of the program.Exported data is put into an ASCII file and can also be downloaded as commadelimited. Again, this is a clumsy way to deal with data today. Cutting andpasting has become second nature to many people. Exporting to an ASCII fileand then bringing the file into a word processor harkens back to dark days ofdatabase searching.IN CONCLUSION     The price for" Gale Business Resources" is $7,995 per year and includesquarterly updates. If you priced out the separate costs for all of theresources included in this product, the cost of having them on this one discis a good deal. However, access to the data is severely affected by the poorinterface and the value of the information is therefore compromised by thisinaccessibility. If you're going to spend nearly $8,000 for a CD-ROM product,you probably won't be too concerned about buying a PC with Windows.

I had my doubts as I waded through the sleazycomplimentary magazines scattered on the sidewalks. But I have never doubtedthat Las Vegas was the perfect host for this computer show, which it has beenfor the past 17 years.     The show has been getting bigger and better every year. This time, itattracted 210,000 visitors and over 2,000 exhibitors. Multimedia was even moreat the heart of the show than it was in 1994, as it came not only from CD-ROMsbut from the hundreds of World Wide Web sites.     As usual, a visit to COMDEX makes it easy to predict what computers andinformation technology applications the next 12 months will bring into ourhomes and offices. Here I only give a condensed report of what the multimedialandscape is likely to look like, but in later columns this year I willdiscuss particular issues more closely.MULTIMEDIA TO GO     The most impressive trend to me was the coming of age of affordable,genuine multimedia notebook computers. IBM undoubtedly had the show stopperwith its incredible ThinkPad 760CD, featuring a 90 MHz Pentium, 8 megabytes(surprisingly low) of RAM, a 12-inch active-matrix screen capable of 16million colors at 640X480 mode, or 65,000 colors at 800X600 mode, a1.2-gigabyte hard disk, a quadruple-speed drive, and an MPEG-2 chip for videoplayback. All this in a sleek design. It's no surprise that this horsepowerallows stunning broadcast-quality video. At the $10,000 price (includingshipping and handling!), however, it will not be the mainstream multimedialaptop in 1996. Nonetheless, it was as impressive as Batman's car.     But there were also numerous notebooks capable of very decent multimediaperformance for $3,500 to $4,500. Among the big guns, Texas Instruments leadsthe way in price/performance with its entry-level Extensa 550CD multimedianotebook. For just under $3,000, it has a 75 MHz Pentium processor, 8megabytes of RAM, 1 megabyte of video RAM, 10.4-inch dual-scan display (256colors at 640X480), PCI bus architecture, 16-bit sound card, microphone andspeakers, 524-megabyte hard drive, and double-speed CD-ROM. Many lesser-knownmanufacturers (AMS, Sager, Patriot) have this typical entry-level multimediaconfiguration at even lower prices. Some notebooks with similarcapabilities--such as the Vectra 4000 from NEC and the Gateway SoloV75--seemed to be overpriced and are likely to be reduced by early this year.     I saw many mouth-watering midrange multimedia notebooks (ToshibaSatellite Pro 410, NEC Versa 4000, Gateway Solo) for about $4,000 to $5,000,sporting 90- or 100-MHz Pentiums, 8 to 16 megabytes of RAM, 540- to720-megabyte hard disks, active matrix or dual-scan screens, andquadruple-speed built-in CD-ROMs. Toshiba announced at the show the price ofthe Tecra 700 Series, which will represent the high end of the multimedianotebook market this year. The Tecra 700CT has a 120-MHz Pentium, 16 megabytesof RAM, a 1-gigabyte hard drive, 11.3-inch active matrix display capable of65,000 colors at 800X600 resolution, 16-bit audio, and a quadruple-speedCD-ROM drive. At a price of $6,000, it certainly will not be an impulse buy.Gateway announced a similar notebook at the same price, and others will followsuit.DESKTOP MULTIMEDIA PROWESS     On the desktops we shall see 100- to 120-MHz Pentiums, with 16 megabytesof RAM, 15- to 17-inch monitors (with 65,000 colors at 800X600),quadruple-speed drives, 1.2-gigabyte hard drives capable of full-screen,full-motion video (through MPEG-1 chips on the motherboard), and hi-fi audioquality (through DSP--Digital Signal Processor--chips instead of sound boards)for about $2,300 to $3,000. IBM sets the tone for the mainstream multimediadesktop with its Aptiva series. Although its case design is nondescript atbest, what is inside the box is impressive and sufficient for good multimediaplayback. You will not see new models featuring Intel 486 processors anddouble-speed drives, as these will become passe this year and will be soldonly at close-outs.AUDIO HARMONY AND CACOPHONY     Recorded audio performance cannot be much improved beyond CD-quality, butthe synthetic music renderings certainly will get better, because in almostall the new audio cards you'll find wave-table synthesis support for MIDIplayback. Audio installation will be much easier because the majority of thenew multimedia systems will come with DSP chips, and users will not need toknow any more about them than they do about math co-processors. While soundboards will still be sold (for the sake of those who want to upgrade theirexisting systems), it will be a much easier task to install the newplug-and-play sound boards if you are using Windows 95 and let the hardwarewizard take over the "seating" arrangement as a maitre d'.     Enhanced CDs will probably be a disappointment. I have played with halfa dozen titles, and (as I will detail in my February column) most of them wereunimpressive and overpriced. Some of my reasons, of course, may be subjective.It is, however, an objective fact that the much-heralded Enhanced CD,particularly the CD Plus (Blue Book) format, will have a very rocky start. Asif it had not caused enough cacophony and confusion, why are there threedifferent enhanced CD formats (Track Zero, Track One and CD Plus)? The latterformat will not run on any of the NEC, Toshiba, and Sanyo drives manufacturedbefore August 1995. This represents at least hundreds of thousands of drivesand a pretty large number of angry customers who will ditch their Sony CD Plusdiscs and be utterly skeptical about the Enhanced CD concept (see my sidebar,"CD Plus Turns Out to Be CD Minus" on page 34).     What gave me some peace of mind amid this cacophony was listening to theseries of sound clips from Network Music in the most elegant and comfortablebooth of the show. We have heard and seen a lot of CD-ROMs with audio clips,but this series exudes professionalism and quality. There are five volumes(business/office, high tech, pop culture, etc.), each with 30 music samples in30- and 60-second, short-tag and loop versions of perfectly recorded music at11 and 22 KHz, and 100 sound effects that you may edit (for perfectly timedfade-in and fade-out) and convert to different sampling rates, frequency, andeven to compressed format to include in your multimedia presentation. Thereare certainly cheaper alternatives, but you get what you pay for. Along withstock film and video footage, this type of mediaware will be significant thisyear.DIGITAL VIDEO DELIGHT     Delightful digital video will finally arrive  this year in a convenientand affordable way. The key to that will be MPEG compression/decompression.MPEG-1 playback chips on the motherboards or on the video accelerator cardswill be widespread and will provide full-screen, full-motion video at least atvideotape quality. MPEG-2 decoder chips (for broadcast-quality video) will belimited to the high-end market because of the price. However, MPEG-1 movies(320X240 resolution and 24 frames/second) will be played back also withouthardware decoders. I have heard claims that MPEG clips played withsoftware-only decoders will produce decent video on 33-MHz Intel 486processors, but my own experience clearly suggests that a 75-MHz Pentium anddouble-speed drive are required as a minimum. As this will be the entry-levelmultimedia machine, I believe that many of the multimedia titles will haveMPEG videos by mid-1996.     CompCore impressed me the most with its MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 hardwareproducts and particularly with the video quality of the SoftPEG software-onlydecompressor. There have already been many contenders for hardware MPEGsolutions, but this fairly young company managed to license its technology tosuch industry heavyweights as NEC, Packard Bell, Hitachi, Cirrus Logic, andATI. It is akin to starting with a few Grand Slam trophies while stillunseeded.     Horizon Technology is another promising provider of software-only MPEGplayback technology with its TrueMotion-S. The company also has a multimediaauthoring package (Open! Info Manager) that facilitates the making ofmultimedia presentations that include motion video. Sirius' Motion Pixelstechnology was yet another impressive demonstration of software-only playbackof highly compressed video files, though not MPEG files. Beyond playbackquality, the crucial issues for developers will be the licensing arrangementand the performance at the compression stage. We shall see a lot of CD-ROMs ona lot of Pentium PCs with much better video than in 1995.     It is too early to predict what will happen this year with the proposedZoomed Video Port (ZV Port) standard, which would allow transfer offull-motion, full-screen video with minimal CPU utilization, through a new PCCard (the card earlier known as PCMCIA). It sounds amazing but I'll believe it(and report about it) when I see it.WHAT MAY NOT FLY IN 1996     There were a couple of announcements of products that may not beavailable in volume in 1996 or that may not have a sizable market. Intel'sPentium Pro is unlikely to have wide appeal. That's the new name for theprocessor that has been mentioned until now as the P6. It is a bad name. Notbecause I would prefer "Sextium," but because users will be confused,especially as both the Pentium and Pentium Pro line will have a 150- and166-MHz product. It also gives the impression that the Pentium itself is notfor the pros. At that high speed, it certainly is.     The PowerPC has been depicted for nearly two years as the Promised Landfor those who want to use both Mac and DOS/Windows products on the samecomputer, and it was characterized as a perfect cooperation among Apple, IBM,and Motorola. While Apple has indeed come out with PowerPC-based systems, IBMhad no desktop computer featuring this processor, and you could not run IBMapplications on the Macs equipped with PowerPC chip. At COMDEX there was againa pavilion dedicated to PowerPC, and it wasn't only birds chirping the newmagic word CHRP (Common Hardware Reference Platform). But I doubt that weshall see any such desktop computers this year that will run both Mac and IBMapplications without third-party emulation software.     Of course the big question for multimedia users is whether high densityor super-density ROMs of several gigabytes capacity will steamroll the680-megabyte CD-ROMs of today. I saw the impressive prototypes; I saw thejoint communique from the formerly warring Sony/Philips andToshiba/Time-Warner teams (and their own brochures), but I'd bet my computerthat the super-density drives will not be shipping in 1996.     In the meantime, we were able to witness at COMDEX how good old CD-ROMtechnology keeps improving. As this is an issue not only for multimedia butalso for non-multimedia CD-ROM applications (and because I'm running out ofspace), I'll discuss CD-ROM drive developments in this month's CD-ROMCommentaries column (page 26).     Las Vegas may have gotten cleaner than it was in the 70s as depicted byScorsese in his current movie, "Casino." While it still is unlikely to hit theBoy Scouts' list of recommended places to visit, it is the perfect place forCOMDEX, and especially for the show's multimedia exhibits. Sometimes I had topause and remember whether I was in a casino on the Strip or in the MultimediaPavilion. Not a bad dilemma.[The following sidebar is included in the article.]                     CD Plus May Turn Out to Be CD Minus          The CD Plus solution has been heralded for a year as the panacea for     the problems of playing back music on an audio CD player from CD-ROMs     that have both computer files and audio CD files--without damaging your     speakers or your ears with white noise as the audio CD player tries to     play back a computer file. Users are warned to skip the first track where     the multimedia file resides, but users don't always pay attention. Many     just toss in the CD-ROM and press the play button.          In the CD Plus format, the audio CD file is on the first track,     followed by a gap and then by the computer file. Sensing the gap, the     audio CD player stops, but the CD-ROM reader can get to the computer     file. The September issue of "Computer Life" magazine depicted such a     wonderful, fairy-tale scenario about CD Plus that I could hardly wait to     get my hands on a CD Plus-format disc. There were none available, so I     held my breath and waited for COMDEX.          It seemed to me to be absurd that while the CD Plus format was     endorsed not only by the Recording Industry Association of America but by     Sony and Philips, Sony had none available at that time, and at its booth     Philips showed upcoming titles in every format except CD Plus. Well, it     turns out that you will not be able to use titles in CD Plus format if     you have--among others--a NEC or a Toshiba drive manufactured before     August 1995. Chances are good that you do, as these drives have been     best-sellers, sold in the hundreds of thousands not only directly to you     but to PC manufacturers (as OEM products) who built these drives into     their computers. And don't forget multimedia kit manufacturers who bundle     sound boards with CD-ROM players.          When I finally got my first CD Plus title ("Bob Dylan's Greatest     Hits," from Sony), I was less than pleased to see that there was no     warning about the fatal incompatibilities. The outside label  tells you     that you need a 486SX 25-MHz or faster system, 8 MB of RAM, Windows 3.1     or higher, 640X480 resolution, 256 colors (8 bit), double-speed or faster     multisession CD-ROM drive and 8-bit sound card. In other words,     single-speed, single-session drive owners need not apply. That's all.          Only when you open the box at home will you find the following     ominous sentences in the user booklet: " . . . certain CD-ROM drives may     not properly recognize CD Plus discs. With [the enclosed] Corel drivers     for Enhanced CD, you may be able to upgrade your CD-ROM drive to make it     CD Plus compatible." But for many drives, this upgrade does not help.          Sony's way of dealing with the incompatibility problem was to put no     outside warning label alerting consumers to it, because users would not     know whether their machines were affected, since most PCs have OEM     drives. This is neither a heart-warming attitude nor a convincing     argument. Hundreds of thousands of users have CD-ROMs that are clearly     labeled by the NEC or Toshiba logo. Even in the case of OEM drives, users     could often find out from the CONFIG.SYS file if they have drive that is     not CD Plus compatible. Sony could have attached on a floppy the Corel     CD-ROM Advisor program (included inside the package on a separate CD). It     could have been made available from Sony's Internet site to let potential     customers check whether their drives were capable of recognizing a CD     Plus format disc.          As I was fiddling with the installation, I bumped into a file that,     although in a proprietary format (presumably to be used by the Corel     Advisor program), was easily deciphered. Having snooped around in this     file, let me do what Sony should have done by advising you about the     brands and models of those multisession and double-speed or faster CD-ROM     and CD-R drives that are unlikely to appropriately handle CD Plus format     discs: NEC CDR601; Multispin 4x Pro, CDR510, and Multispin 74-1; TEAC     CD-50; Plextor DM-XX24K; Aiwa ACD-300; Hitachi CDR-6750 and CDR 37-50;     Reno CD-ROMX2A; Yamaha CDR100; and Ricoh RO1060C. These latter two are     recorders/players. The Toshiba XM3501 and XM-3601 are likely to skip on     audio, rendering them useless.          The fatal incompatibility problem and Sony's attitude are likely to     spoil the (post-) Christmas spirit and will dampen the enthusiasm of the     public not only for the CD Plus format but for the entire enhanced CD     concept. Not long ago, MediaVision went bankrupt over its sound card's     incompatibility problems and its attitude toward handling of returns.     Disney burnt its fingers with the bug-ridden CD-ROM release of "The Lion     King" a year ago. Intel was grilled for shipping processor chips that     calculated incorrectly in some situations and paid dearly for not     advising customers sincerely.          Sony will lose some of its credibility, and cooling down disgruntled     customers and CD Plus distributors will cost Sony more than spelling out     specifically the limitations of the CD Plus titles would have done.     --Peter Jacso     [Peter Jacso is associate professor of library and information studies atthe University of Hawaii.

Specifically, if a portion of the network was decimated byThe Bomb, data packets could be rerouted, so communication would not betotally disrupted. This explains why an ailing computer or router in Atlanta,for instance, does not bring the entire Net to its knees--although data"traffic" to that part of the world may be somewhat slower.     This efficient design and function are aspects that make the Internet sovaluable in today's global economy. As information professionals, most of ushave eagerly embraced the Internet as a multifaceted tool, using it forinformation retrieval, networking, and communications. Scientists andresearchers, of course, were using the Net long before most of us realizedthat it even existed. These days, a staggering range of folks are using theNet to ply their trade or practice their profession.SOMEBODY'S BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOUR SAFETY AND SURVIVAL     The reliability of the Internet's distributed structure makes it idealfor disaster planning and emergency management.

Don't trash that fax machine! A recent survey of Fortune 500companies by Gallup/Pitney Bowes found that firms with e-mail capabilitiessend just as many faxes as firms without e-mail. Also, the poll found thatfaxes were preferred over e-mail, voice mail, or overnight delivery servicefor a quick answer.     As for smaller businesses, only 21 percent of their owners with awarenessof the Internet were actually using it, according to a Gallup/MCI survey.Thirty-five percent said it was too expensive; 35 percent said the technologywas too complex, and 46 percent admitted they were "cyberphobic."     Business misuse of the Internet is another issue entirely. Recently,Virgin Atlantic Airways (U.K.) was fined $14,000 by the U.S. Department ofTransportation (DOT) for placing a "misleading" fare ad on the Internet.According to the "Atlanta Journal-Constitution" (11/22/95), this was the firsttime DOT had fined an airline for information posted on the Net.

Some journals are in thepractice of running abstracts--or entire articles--online weeks before thehard copy becomes available. And papers are often posted on a Web site priorto a conference where their findings will be announced. While the U.S. Patentand Trademark Office  hasn't issued an official ruling on "electronicdisclosure," a spokesman indicated that patent lawyers should assume thatanything available online should be considered "published."CREDIT CARD SECURITY RISK UPDATE     Is the widespread fear of sending a credit card number over the Internetjustified? Not when you consider the alternatives, concluded Peter H. Lewis,a "New York Times" reporter who addressed the subject in an article lastNovember. "Sending a credit card number over the Internet to an electronicmerchant is probably the safest way to make such a transaction," Lewis wrote."In the last week, for example, I handed my credit card to a waiter whodisappeared with it for five minutes. I faxed my credit card information to abusiness in New Jersey, and the fax probably lay exposed to everyone in thatoffice for hours and perhaps to the cleaning crew that night. I called a hoteland gave my credit card data to a reservation clerk and continued myrecklessness by ordering some merchandise from a clothing catalog, again byreading my credit card information to some unseen operator. . . . Comparedwith the risk of handing my credit card to a stranger, which I do nearly everyday, sending it over the Internet is pretty secure."

While it is probably overly optimisticto claim that the difficulties of finding information on the Net havedisappeared, the latest enhancements to search engines, such as Yahoo!, Lycos,and Open Text, amount to a significant step in the right direction.     One of the most impressive new entrants comes from IBM, which has teamedup with Ontario-based Open Text Corp. to launch a World Wide Web-based searchservice that retrieves data both from Web pages and from information providerssuch as Disclosure, Information Access Company, and Cambridge ScientificAbstracts.INFOMARKET SEARCH     Called the infoMarket Search service, it lets users search multipledatabases simultaneously across the Net. Users are able to search sourcesthrough a single interface, with infoMarket Search able to access text andmultimedia data and then merge results together. The service was free ofcharge to users at the time this column was written, though charges will beannounced early in 1996.     According to Open Text, its retrieval engine is unique in being able tosearch millions of Web pages in under five seconds and for its understandingof the structure of documents found on the WWW. Open Text's technology usesautomated "crawlers" to index the complete text of Web documents. These indexevery word on every page, as well as recording the structural context of eachindexed string. They constantly search for new documents to index and revisitsites frequently to add to the master index.     At launch, the sources accessible via infoMarket Search are Yahoo!, theOpen Text Index of Web documents, the content of 13,000 Usenet newsgroups, andthe McKinley listing of rated sites on the Internet. In the latter case,Internet resources have been reviewed and evaluated by research specialistsand McKinley's editorial advisory boards for content, currency, organizationof the resource, ease of use, and accessibility. According to IBM,negotiations are under way with a variety of other content providers, rangingfrom "news services to digital libraries and image databases."     IBM says that publishers with content distributed among differentplatforms or locations will be able to use infoMarket Search to createtailored "virtual services" for their customers. Users will also be able toinstall infoMarket agents to enable them to search internal and externalsources through one interface. "The aim of the infoMarket service is to enableend users to enter a single query that is capable of interrogating nearly allof the common database formats, supports numerous search engines, and deliverscontent to  the predominant end-user platforms," explained Jeff Crigler, vicepresident of IBM infoMarket. "The service can also be modified to meet users'particular requirements or systems."YAHOO! AND OPEN TEXT     Open Text is also involved in a move to add a search capability toYahoo!, one of the Web's most comprehensive subject guides. Yahoo!, whichcatalogs Web pages according to subject headings, now also offers the abilityto search its entries using the Open Text retrieval engine.     Using Open Text, Yahoo! users will be able to conduct searches forspecific words and phrases, multilevel Boolean searches, as well as weightedsearches. Inquiries can be narrowed to specific categories in Yahoo!'shierarchical index, and users will also be able to use structural operatorssuch as document title, sub-headings, body copy, and footnotes as qualifiersfor their searches. Additionally, Open Text will offer the ability to retrievedocuments "similar" to those a user has already found.     "The Open Text technology expands Yahoo! with a 'back of the book'word-by-word index of the Internet, which complements our 'front of the book'hierarchical index," said Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo!. "This will boostthe efficiency and productivity of both browsing and more serious searching onYahoo!, and broaden its appeal to a wider range of Internet users."LYCOS SPIDER     One of Yahoo!'s rivals, the Lycos Spider, has not been sitting stilleither. It has a fresh interface, along with support for HotJava and"backlinks"--which let users who have clicked to Lycos from another sitereturn directly to the original site by clicking on an icon on the Lycossearch screen. A new search form lets users set display options, such as toone-line summaries, or for hits that are "loosely matched" or "very stronglymatched."     Lycos has also added reviews of the top 5 percent World Wide Websites--graded for content, presentation, and the "experience" of accessingthem. As part of a $3 million acquisition of Point Communications Corp., theLycos search engine has integrated Point's review and rating guide to the Web.After carrying out a search of the Web, the user will be able to view thesearch results from the Lycos catalog, together with ratings of sitesretrieved.     A team of about 30 Point reviewers employs a 50-point scale to rate Websites for content, as well as for presentation and the experience of using thesite, defined as whether the site is worth the time, and whether the userwould recommend it to others. Web sites landing in the top 5 percent areawarded Badges of Excellence. Current holders include the Global HealthNetwork, Mobil Oil, and Lucas Arts.     The Lycos Web site has also integrated Point Communications' Point Nowservice, which provides brief items of business news, stocks, and weather,with hotlinks to CNN and other news sources. Lycos itself was launched lastJune as a commercial avenue for the Spider search technology first developedat Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Eight million sites, or 91 percent of theWeb, are indexed by the service.WEBCOMPASS     Established software vendors are also getting in on the Web searchingact. Quarterdeck has unveiled software that allows users to send a singlequery to multiple Web search engines, then receive a summary of resultsincluding subtopics. Using WebCompass, searchers can also automatically updateresults, store them locally on the PC, and assign rankings to them.     When a user enters a query or topic of interest, WebCompass pollsmultiple search engines, such as Lycos and InfoSeek, for relevant Web pages.The content of these pages is summarized and presented to the user. When thereare a large number of results, WebCompass automatically groups the summarizedpages into subtopics, giving the user the option to drill down on specifictopics.     WebCompass also lets users build a personalized index of topics that theyare interested in and store retrieved data in a database based in theMicrosoft Access 2.0 file format. The software can be set to perform regularlyscheduled queries on selected Web sites to update existing information in thedatabase. The user can additionally assign a rating system, from one to five,for the importance of topics and subtopics, which the WebCompass search enginewill use in the future to sort data during updates.     "The idea behind WebCompass is to let the user multiply the power of themany Web search engines available by performing one search from his or her PC.We hope it will greatly reduce the time people must spend searching andanalyzing the data available on all of the search engines on the Internet,"said Emerick Woods, vice president and general manager of the Internetbusiness unit at Quarterdeck.     WebCompass, Personal Edition, which will cost under $100, works with anyWeb browser and runs on a 486-based PC with a minimum of 8 megabytes ofmemory, with 16 megabytes recommended.

Benson     Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., 1995     ISBN: 1-55570-178-7 (softcover)     407 pages, $49.95     Reviewed by Virginia Gatcheff Gehrig     If a library can only buy one book to learn about the Internet, "TheComplete Internet Companion for Librarians" is the book to buy. Thiscomprehensive book covers all aspects of the Internet, from hardwarerequirements to training staff members. Benson's text is easy to read and isgeared for those new to the online world. Yet, experienced Internet surferswill not be bored. His specific audience is "librarians who are responsiblefor planning and setting up their organization's computer system." Thoseinvolved in online reference services or anyone who exchanges information overthe Internet will also benefit from this book.     "The Complete Internet Companion for Librarians" is divided into sixparts. Part One, "Overview of the Internet," describes the Internet fornewcomers and explains what hardware and software is required to gain accessto the "information superhighway." A list of national Internet serviceproviders is included.     Part Two, "Tools and Protocols," describes in detail how to use the threemain communications services of the Internet: ftp (file transfer protocol),telnet, and e-mail. Part Three, "Search Utilities and the Client/ServerModel," focuses on resource discovery tools such as Archie, WAIS (Wide AreaInformation Servers), World Wide Web browsers, and gophers.     Part Four, "General Resources," gives a broad overview of the types ofinformation services available on the Internet such as listserv discussionlists, Campus-Wide Information Systems, and Usenet newsgroups. Part Five,"Integrating the Internet into Traditional Library Services," focusesexclusively on how a library can use the Internet effectively. This section isexplained in more detail below. Part Six, "Internet Resources Arranged bySubject A-Z," is a selective list of Internet services and resources.     Chapter 21, "The Librarian's Role in Implementing Internet," givespractical advice for the librarians assigned to the task of establishing theInternet in the library's environment. A significant portion of the chapter isdevoted to training, and examples in the books can be used during trainingsessions. The chapter also gives ample training outlines and suggestedcontent. Benson also discusses the issues of copyright and digital informationand how portions of copyright law apply to libraries and computer systems. Thechapter includes a recommended Internet use policy and tips on how to usepublic relations to garner community support of the Internet in the library.Sample community demonstrations are included for adult services, youthservices, high school, and college students. Most helpful may be the sectionon how to integrate the Internet into existing services and how to add valueto Internet services. The chapter closes with some profiles on how librariansare becoming involved in online publishing with such efforts as local historyarchives and locating and repackaging information.     Chapter 22, "Implementing Internet Service In-House," takes the Internetbeyond the reference room and provides ideas for using the Internet throughoutthe library. This chapter shows how the Internet can be used in technicalservices, acquisitions, and collection development.     Chapter 23, "Reference Services," returns to the reference room anddetails how to effectively use the Internet in answering the three most commontypes of reference questions: author/title questions, fact-finding questions,and subject questions. Benson discusses the problems associated with locatingand accessing information, primarily the Internet's tremendous size and vastresources. He offers some time- and trouble-saving tips for searchingefficiently and introduces the reader to Infopop. (Infopop is a Windows-basedapplication that allows users to create their own indexes on Internetresources.)     Examples are used extensively throughout the entire book. In severalplaces, exercises are included to encourage the reader to become familiar withthe Internet and how it works. "The Complete Internet Companion forLibrarians" also includes a list of library-related discussion lists and tellshow to subscribe to them. Benson's book is a valuable resource for librariansimplementing the Internet. Its specific focus on the library's use of theInternet makes it preferable to other general reference books.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION TODAY via NewsNetJanuary 1996FASTER AUTHORING SYSTEMS AND DISC DRIVES     Like many other things in our technologically advancing society, CD-ROMcapabilities are constantly "new and improved." Here are two examples: ahigh-speed authoring system and a faster CD-ROM drive.DATA/WARE'S HIGH-SPEED CD-AUTHORING SYSTEM     Data/Ware Development has released its Server Enterprise Authoring System(S/EAS), a high-speed CD-authoring system. S/EAS is the latest addition toData/Ware Development's line of optical storage and CD-authoring systems. Likethe Enterprise Authoring System (EAS) from which it is derived, S/EAS includesall of the hardware and software required to author CDs in an automated,lights-out environment.     According to Dale Smith, vice president of new product development forData/Ware, large organizations in fields ranging from banking and insurance totelecommunications and government are turning to data distribution by CD as acost-effective alternative to COM or paper. "In addition to reducing theexpenses associated with producing, distributing, and storing COM and paperdocuments," said Smith, "CDs make it fast and easy to access data. The resultis improved productivity and customer service."     S/EAS requires no mainframe processing to produce CDs. Instead, aUNIX-based SPARCserver handles all pre-processing and processing steps.     S/EAS accepts data or images from 3480/3490 tape cartridges, a LAN/WAN,or a mainframe. After data or images are downloaded to S/EAS, custom softwareprepares it for recording to CDs and also extracts indexes from reports asrequired. After the pre-processing phase is finished, S/EAS masters the datato make it conform to the ISO 9660 standard for recording and reading data onCDs. S/EAS can operate multiple 2x or 6x CD writers simultaneously and can beequipped with robotic feeders. Each feeder can hold 75 CDs, enough to last anentire production shift.     To view data, end users simply insert a S/EAS CD into a standard CD-ROMdrive in any PCrunning Windows.In addition to rapid data access, users can cutand paste data to other PC applications such as word processors, databases,and spreadsheets. They can also print and fax on demand.

"Toshiba's new XM-3701 Series drives meet the needs of OEMs, VAD/VARs,and distributors who need to provide cutting-edge performance and high-qualitydrives to their customers today," said Jerry Higgins, vice president ofproduct marketing, CD-ROM, TAIS DPD. "These new drives with their 1,000KB/sec. sustained data transfer rate and 120 ms random seek time provideCD-ROM users with the performance necessary to support smooth full-motionvideo and complex high-end graphics transfers from CD-ROMs."     The new XM-3701 Series' fast rotational speed of 6.7x was achievedthrough enhanced error correction, employment of a digital signal processor,and an improved optical pick-up head and spindle motor. In addition to the6.7x rotational speed, the drives also support rotations of 1x and 2x.     The XM-3701 CD-ROM drives employ the variable speed playback system usedin previous Toshiba CD-ROM drives. The variable-speed playback system allowsthe drive to read data before the disk reaches a specific rotational speed of1, 2, or 6.7 times standard rotational speeds. As a result, the CD-ROM driveprovides improved drive read times. The variable-speed playback also decreasespower consumption to 5.9 watts average.     The low-mass optical pick-up and digital servo control featured in theXM-3701 drives ensure fast access to complex data, video, and audio fileslocated anywhere on the disc. The digital servo control provides greatertracking precision and head position, ultimately giving the drives their 120ms random seek time.     The XM-3701 Series drives comply with MPC-3 and-2 specifications and arecompatible with Kodak multi-session Photo-CD and CD-Plus, red book, yellowbook, and CD-ROM XA. The drives are also CD-Bridge, CD-i, and CD-i Readycompatible and can be used as a CD-Audio player, independent of the computersystem.     The XM-3701 Series drives feature a sealed enclosure that maintains acontamination-free environment for data integrity. The result is a high MTBFof 100,000 hours. The SCSI-2 interface XM-3701 Series drives support CD-DAtransfers over the SCSI bus for maximum bandwidth utilization and feature a256 KB data buffer.     The drives may be mounted horizontally or vertically for userflexibility. The tray-type electrical disc loader eliminates the need for acaddy, and the drives feature a media removal prevention function. The XM-3701Series drives are available in internal and external models. The XM-3701Binternal drive has a suggested list price of $415, and the TXM-3701D externaldrive has a suggested list price of $515.

Two experts in multimedia production and publishing have formed a newmultimedia production house called The Armchair Travel Company, Ltd. It hasbeen co-founded by William Donelson, who spent 10 years with the Media Lab atthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and William Beckett,who has many years of experience with leading U.K. multimedia publishingcompanies, including Virgin Interactive Entertainment. The new technology,called Virtual Travel, was debuted in the company's first CD-ROM game, amurder mystery called "Foul Play--Mystery At Awkward Manor."     Virtual Travel uses special photographic techniques and computer softwareto simulate the experience of walking through an environment and turningaround to examine it from all angles. The technique uses still frames whichare then made into movie walkways and panoramas. Virtual Travel can usesoftware specifically developed by Armchair Travel when it is necessary foranimations of live actors to be inserted into the panoramas. Alternatively, itcan use Apple's QuickTimeVR, which has other advantages but does not currentlyoffer superimposition of animations.     "Photographic imagery can provide infinitely more detail than even themost carefully rendered 3D imagery," asserted Donelson, who first conceived ofthe Virtual Travel technology in the mid-1970s while working at MIT.     "The excellent quality achievable using these techniques, combined withthe fast postproduction of Apple's QuickTimeVR technology, is set torevolutionize the creation of background imagery in multimedia software,"Donelson said. "You can soon expect to see high-quality interactive tours offascinating locations around the world, as well as the innovative use of thesetechniques in games."     Beckett, who has produced multimedia titles that have won British,American, and European awards, is directing the new company's marketingefforts.     The Armchair Travel Company has worked closely with the BritishBroadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Apple Computer on the innovative use ofVirtual Travel.

Through thisinitiative, it will provide current, relevant information to all citizens ofits school communities regardless of geographic location or district size.Based on input from the library community, the Instructional TechnologyDivision of TEA will work with Auto-Graphics Inc. of Pomona, California, toimplement two related information resources projects through this initiative.     The first resource to be developed identifies the actual, physicallocation of books, audio and video tapes, computer software, filmstrips, andother audio-visual resources by merging all the electronic records of schoollibrary resources into one database. Until now, Texas did not have a statewideresource-sharing database. The new database, called the TLC union catalog,identifies the needed book or audiovisual item and points to the location ofthe item at the user's local library or at any other district, regional, orstate library.     The second resource provided by TLC is the electronic full text ofmagazines, journals, newspapers, and other informational databases that can beaccessed remotely. Students searching for subjects in these databases willfind the entire magazine or newspaper article about that subject, rather thansimply a citation referring to an article in a newspaper or magazine that mayor may not be available in the student's local library.     "In order to succeed," said Anita Givens, senior director forinstructional technology, "students must learn the skills necessary todiscover and select relevant information and to use that information toaccomplish specific objectives. TLC provides Texas students with theopportunity to learn real-world information utilization skills and with accessto an expanded world of resources."     Students statewide will be able to access Impact/ONLINE and the TLCdatabase either through direct connections to the Internet or through dial-upservices provided by another state initiative, TENET, the Texas EducationNETwork. Utilizing the TEA's Internet network, TENET, which is already inplace, provided a significant cost savings to the state.     The diverse geographical aspects of Texas have made connecting thelibraries that serve Texas' 3.6 million students in over 1,000 schooldistricts a challenge. Gloria McClanahan, director of library media services,said, "One vital part of this initiative is to ensure universal informationaccess to students throughout the state of Texas, especially those studentswho reside in remote, rural areas."     Auto-Graphics originally made the database available through the use ofclient/server software, but the company also developed a World Wide Weblocation so that the database is accessible to any individual using theInternet with any type of software and hardware. Students can simply do asearch from their school library, and if the resource is at another library,they can request that the item be sent to their local school library bycreating an interlibrary loan request.     "Impact/ONLINE will give the state of Texas the ability to provideresource sharing to every school," said William Kliss, vice president of salesand marketing at Auto-Graphics. "It will remove the walls from the schoollibraries, allowing students to quickly search a much greater resource andobtain expensive or difficult-to-find materials easily."     Impact/ONLINE builds in ease-of-use features designed to make studentsself-sufficient when accessing information. This includes user-friendlyinterfaces and context-sensitive help messages. It also provides librarianswith time-saving cataloging tools for preparing books and other informationresources, enabling these materials to be easily located. Librarians willminimize the amount of time spent identifying and cataloging material toenable them to spend more time with students and staff.     With the advent of Impact/ONLINE, schools that are not currentlyautomated will have increased choices available to them to automate and havetheir records included in the statewide database. This further increasesaccess to information for students and others throughout the state. There isalso a telecommunications infrastructure initiative in progress that is tofocus on rural areas, with the goal of connecting all remote area schools andlibraries, as well as for use with telemedicine.

This heralds thebeginning of a new service from The Research Libraries Group (RLG)--directaccess to and local use of major book vendor records.     Libraries can use such records in several ways. They provide valuablecitations for new and recent publications. In the case of the Casalinirecords, bibliographers or acquisitions librarians can export them with RLIN'spass or put command to create order records in their local systems. Librariesthat have already received materials described in the records can export themto use for local cataloging--or can do their cataloging directly in RLIN andthen export the result to the local online public access catalog (OPAC).     With such book supplier records available in RLIN, individual librariesare spared the local time and expense of evaluating, loading, and maintainingthese files themselves. In its negotiations with other book vendors, RLG isconcerned about keeping prices as low as possible in order to encourage use ofthese records and to assist users in minimizing technical processing costs.     RLG President James Michalko said that this step responds directly toRLG's mission. "We're growing RLIN in many ways to enhance its usefulness toresearch with early works, currently received materials, primary sources, andunique cataloging, from the American Antiquarian Society's records to UNLibrary data. This new kind of information from Casalini is of particularimport to collections serving international scholarship. It will be of greatvalue in supporting users of all kinds."     The Casalini records cover materials of all kinds available in Italy, theVatican City, San Marino, the Italian canton of Switzerland, and Malta. Theydescribe publications in various formats including monographs, serials,monographic series, microfilm, audiovisual, and CD-ROM. In the future,Casalini Libri will be adding records regularly to RLIN via Internet filetransfer protocol.     Casalini Libri order information is included on each record, but theserecords represent far more than just a book dealer's title list. Each has beenprepared by expert staff directly from the published works, gives completebibliographical information, and, if necessary, includes notes in English withadditional details (which may not be evident from the strict bibliographicdescription of the work) that Casalini Libri believes to be of significance toselectors. Important noncommercial publications, even though they may not befor sale, are also included. And in particular circumstances, unrevisedreprints, extracts, and theses are described.     "This new service combines the value of records like the Casalini's withRLIN's ability to integrate service into the local processing environment,"said Linda Lerman, RLG bibliographic services officer. "Negotiations areprogressing with other book dealers who count RLG's members and RLIN usersamong their best clients. A key goal is to help shorten the distance frominitial publication to having a work in the library, ready for use."

Theupdate includes enhancements and features suggested by technical servicesstaff at various levels:     --   Several record saving options are now available. Users may save tothe active (master) file, an export (transaction) file, and/or an externalsystem, in any combination, simultaneously. These options may be toggled onand off at will. A separate option permits users to save a single record to aseparate new or existing MARC file without altering default configurationsettings.     --   A publisher's ISBN prefix may now be used to generate a Result Setthat lists all of that publisher's works.     --   Users may limit a search to an entire country instead of a singlepolitical subdivision. For example, to search for items published in the U.S.,users may enter "??u" as the place of publication.     --   Configuration changes that were made on-the-fly may be abandoned atany time in favor of the last saved default configuration.     --   Enhancements to the MARC editor make it easier to move among openrecords. Users may now select multiple entries from a Result Set and havemultiple MARC editors open at once. In addition, users may move among openrecords with a keystroke or mouse click.     --   Users may now choose to search until a dataset produces a ResultSet, and then continue the search with the next available dataset. Users mayalso choose to search all datasets at once and produce a separate Result Setfor each.     "Records come up quickly, and being able to look at more than one recordat a time is most helpful," said Debra Mattingly, director of the WashingtonCounty (Jonesborough, Tennessee) Library. "I find it useful to tilehorizontally so I can easily cut and paste from one field or record toanother. This is especially helpful with multiple 949 holding fields."

Using thiscapability, a user with responsibility for analyzing competitors, for example,could program agents to retrieve Web pages from competitors' Web sites wheninformation is posted or altered. The Navigator could bring those pages to aNotes database containing competitive information, then Notes would distributethe updated information to the company's sales force every morning.     InterNotes Web Navigator translates standard Web HTML 3.0 documents,including forms, tables, photos, graphics, hyperlinks, and URLs, into Notesfor management in Notes. Notes users can also browse and retrieve Internetinformation that exists beyond the Web, such as ftp, gopher, and Usenet, andintegrate it into Notes applications.

The language iscurrently being debated by House Conference Committee conferees to H.R. 1555,the "Telecommunications Act of 1995."     IIA is the leading trade association representing over 500 companiesinvolved in providing and distributing information products and servicesworldwide. Since its founding in 1968, IIA has been at the forefront of policydecisions and initiatives that have shaped the National InformationInfrastructure.     The White language would make it illegal for online service providers toknowingly send directly to minors or to electronically display any materialthat is deemed harmful to minors, ensure limited liability for Internet accessproviders regarding content not under their control, and protect onlineservice providers from liability if they screen offensive material.     "IIA and its members have always championed the responsible use of onlineservices. The White proposal represents a sensible balance between the need toprotect our children from pornographic material and efforts to invigorate theInternet through the free and open exchange of ideas without fear of excessivegovernment regulation," said Ronald G. Dunn, president of IIA.     Previous proposals to impose liabilities for online service providershave been troublesome to IIA and its members, particularly because they failedto reflect marketplace realities, threatened First Amendment rights, andexcluded incentives for users to act responsibly.     "Government oversight and regulation is no substitute for market-basedsolutions and parental empowerment. The White proposal would not only createincentives for the development of encryption technologies, thereby limitingthe possibility of a 'chilling effect' on the Internet, but would give parentsa larger role in deciding what is appropriate viewing material for theirchildren," Dunn said.

Miller, assistant library director at theSalem (Oregon) Public Library, helped the institution become the first publiclibrary in the state to navigate the Internet.     Miller managed the final planning stage of a project that made thelibrary, in partnership with the City/County Data Center, the full-serviceInternet provider of choice to the Salem area. The system also made localgovernment files available online to the community and established a newchannel for voters to communicate with elected public officials.     As a result of his pioneering efforts, recognized by UMI and his homecommunity, Miller will serve as the independent judge for the 1996 LibraryTechnology award. The award was established in 1991 in cooperation withInformation Today, Inc., sponsor of the annual National Online Meeting.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFORMATION TODAY via NewsNetJanuary 1996HEALTH CARE ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY     A new survey suggests that the information revolution is redefiningaccess to health care. Consumers are more accepting of health information,including advice about treatment received through a telephone or onlineservice, even if it means giving up a face-to-face visit with a care provider.     These are among the findings of a statewide survey sponsored by BlueCross and Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSM). The survey was released recentlyat a national conference in Minneapolis entitled, "Health Care on theSuperhighway: The Information Management Revolution."     The survey was conducted last October among benefit decision makers incompanies with 100 or more employees and among Minnesota residents who receivehealth care coverage from an employer with 100 or more workers.     "The survey is the clearest evidence to date of how dramatically accessto health care is being redefined by both employers and employees," said JimWoodburn, M.D., medical director of national accounts for Blue Plus, the HMOaffiliate of BCBSM. "How people get information--and in some cases, eventreatment--is less important than the quality and convenience of theinformation."     Woodburn said that personal contact with care providers remains importantfor many health-related issues, but giving up some face-to-face contact mightbe an acceptable trade-off for health information received over the telephoneor with a computer.     The survey asked consumers and employers to evaluate three differentelectronic services. The most highly regarded by both groups is a 24-hourtelephone service in which a nurse diagnoses a health problem and provides thecaller with recommendations for self-treatment.     About eight out of 10 health care consumers surveyed--77 percent--saidthey would use such a service, and 81 percent of employers in companies ofmore than 100 employees would be likely to offer the service if it wasavailable.     A telephone or online service that provides information on health caretopics of general interest would be used by 63 percent of the consumers andoffered by 61 percent of employers, according to the survey.     The third option posed in the survey--telephone or online directoriesthat list health care providers and specific information on quality of care,patient satisfaction measures, and fees--would likely be used by 60 percent ofconsumers and 61 percent of employers.     Both employers and their insured workers and families place a high valueon the quality of electronic information services. However, convenience ranksnearly as high as quality among the factors that would influence consumers'decisions to use telephone or online services. The services' cost is cited asan influential factor by only 38 percent of consumers.     Cost, however, is paramount to employers, cited by 62 percent as aninfluential factor. Quality--cited by 55 percent of employers--ranks secondamong issues that would shape an employer's decision to offer electronicservices as part of a company health plan.     "What makes the findings especially striking is the high acceptance ofelectronic information services even though both employees and employersbelieve they would depersonalize health care," said Woodburn.     While majorities of both consumers and employers said that electronicservices could depersonalize health care, the survey found that, for 44percent of consumers, electronic information might be a satisfactoryreplacement for face-to-face contact with a health care provider.HEALTH CARE IN THE YEAR 2000     Both employers and employees are convinced that electronic healthinformation services will dramatically increase access to health care in theyear 2000, but they are less certain about the impact on quality and cost.     The two groups were asked to assume that in the year 2000, 25 percent ofall information about treatment options was provided through electronicservices. Based on that scenario, 83 percent of employers and 77 percent ofconsumers said health care would be more accessible. However, only 68 percentof employers and 57 percent of employees said care would be more affordablefive years from now. Sixty percent of employers said that quality of healthcare would improve, but a minority of employees--49 percent-- agreed thatquality would be higher at the turn of the century.ABOUT THE SURVEY     The survey was conducted by Rockwood Research. Interviews of bothemployers and people covered by an employer-provided health plan wereconducted by telephone between October 19th and 26th, 1995.

With divergent House and Senate approaches contained intelecom-reform bills still awaiting conference-committee action, Internetcontent control continues to be a bone of contention between proponents offederal regulation and free-speech advocates.     "Internet filters work as a child-safety cap on the personal computer,"according to IEEE-USA Board Chair Joel B. Snyder. "This technology can giveusers and their families control over choices on the Internet, withoutgovernment having to resort to unnecessary and ineffective controls on thefree flow of information."     Driving the legislative debate so far have been fears that theunregulated growth of cyberspace has opened opportunities for purveyors ofobscene or indecent materials to reach children now going online at home andat school. While some believe that federal restrictions on content providersare the answer, IEEE-USA argues that government censorship attempts will notwork on the transnational Internet and warns that government controls threatento choke a vibrant medium founded on free information exchange.     The 33rd Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting in Stockholm,chaired this past summer by Internet pioneer and IEEE Fellow Vinton G. Cerf,led to a new IETF working group that is developing the necessary technicalstandards for reader-selectivity products. In the U.S., a broad industryconsortium announced in September that it will create a consensualcontent-labeling system, the Platform for Internet Content Selection,scheduled for release in early 1996.     Most content-filtering methods fall into one of three categories. Hostaccess control features software packages that run on the user's computer andexclude access to sources known to contain objectionable material or thatallow access only to sites designated as acceptable. Information filteringusing source labels would allow specific materials to be rated by their sourceand filtered. Information filtering using third-party ratings combines theadvantages of third-party monitoring with fine "granularity," an ability tosort materials within even a single document. Consumers could subscribe to arating service to select or exclude content based on that organization'scriteria.     In the near future, responsible adults may be able to combine a varietyof technical approaches to create the most appropriate environment forchildren in their care. For example, parents might install labeling-compliantbrowser software on the home computer, subscribe to a third-party service, andconfigure the browser to verify for age-appropriateness with the labelingservice before downloading text or pictures or connecting to chat groups. Theymight also configure the browser to block children's access to items theservice has not labeled. Or, if parents want to permit somewhat greateraccess, they might set the browser to consult the sources' own labels.     IEEE-USA has pledged the efforts of U.S. engineers to assist in realizingthe full promise of the new technologies. In creating a cyberspace environmentappropriate for children, "technology alone is not a substitute forconscientious parenting, adult supervision, and common sense," said Snyder.However, he adds, "U.S. engineers can be part of the solution by educating thepublic on the effective use of Internet resources, by helping to develop thenext generation of electronic filtering technologies, and by using theirtechnical know-how to enable their families and community schools to explorecyberspace wisely."

Madoff Investment Securities Inc. plans to installits own ticker plant using FD Consulting Inc.'s TiPS ticker plantsystem. A long-time Telekurs (formerly Standard & Poor's) TickerIII user, Madoff is expected to discontinue its use of theconsolidated feed product.  Peter Madoff, head of trading and architect of the firm'strading systems, declined to comment on the move. But sourcesclose to the firm say Madoff's decision to build its own tickerplant is part of the firm's continuing effort to gain morecontrol over all elements of its trading operation.  The new ticker plant will consolidate direct feeds from CQS(Consolidated Quotation Service), CTA (Consolidated TapeAssociation), OPRA (Options Price Reporting Authority) and NASDAQ(Level 1). Until now, Madoff, an electronic market maker, hasbeen operating without these direct feeds.  Not everyone thinks building an in-house ticker plant makessense -- especially when there are consolidated data feedsavailable from Telekurs, Reuters and others. But not everyoneuses a price box to price nearly 10,000 automated executions perday. At Madoff, more than at other firms, the bottom line dependson the accuracy and timeliness of the market data source used toprice trades.  As a registered specialist on the Cincinnati Stock Exchange andelectronic market maker in over 300 listed securities, Madoffexecutes 95% of its trades without human intervention. Madoffguarantees its clients execution at the best consolidated insidequote for quantities up to 3000 shares. If Madoff's executionprice doesn't match the best bid or offer as it appears in theNYSE's time and sales log, for example, Madoff is obliged to makeup the difference.  Madoff won't disclose the data source it uses to price itstransactions. The firm is known to purchase data services fromTelekurs, Bridge, Instinet, Quotron and others.                         Once Burned...  During an average trading day, a time lag between aconsolidated data feed product such as Telekurs Ticker III anddirect lines from SIAC, OPRA or NASDAQ might result in adiscrepancy of a fraction of a point.  But during peak periods of volatility, such as last October'sBlack Friday, the same time lag might result in a discrepancy ofseveral points -- especially for trades in United Airlines stock,for example.  If Madoff had priced its Black Friday transactions with a datafeed that lagged the best bids and offers as they appeared on CQS(the Consolidated Quotation System), make-goods on those tradeswould be costly. Costly enough to easily justify the price tag ofan internal ticker plant.  Electronic market makers obliged to execute at the bestconsolidated inside quote can't afford to be out of sync withSIAC's CQS feed at any time. For Madoff to operate with anythingless than direct CQS, CTA, OPRA and NASDAQ feeds leaves the firmvulnerable.  Apart from the issue of time and price discrepancies created byfast-moving markets, consolidated data feed hosts can experiencedowntime while markets continue to trade.                        Speeds and Feeds  Telekurs' Ticker III has been delivered at two different outputspeeds, 9.6 and 19.2 kilobits per second, since Sept. 89, twomonths after the product was acquired from Standard & Poor's.  All new customers for Ticker III take the feed at 19.2 kbs andTelekurs is offering the higher speed feed to its customers at noadditional charge.  During the most recent October market break, Ticker III's 9.6kbs feed suffered significant delays -- up to ten minutes behindCQS, according to Telekurs officials.  Recent tests conducted at a major brokerage suggest thatTelekurs' 19.2 kbs feed has substantially eliminated the capacityproblems of the slower speed feed.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE MARKET DATA via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990MICROSTAT TO LAUNCH STOCKQUOTE SYSTEM BASED ON NeXT  Executives from Microstat Development Corp., a small quotesystems developer in Vancouver, are making a long pilgrimageeastward this week to unveil a stock quote system and brokerworkstation to the New York financial community. Called Omen III,the system is the first such application designed for the NeXTInc. microcomputer, the sleek black multimedia box that StevenJobs' new company has begun to ship.  Omen III is the third broker workstation Microstat hasintroduced since it was founded in 1983. The product'spredecessors, now defunct Omen I and three-year-old Omen II, weredeveloped as simple stock quote systems for brokers who wantedinformation from the Vancouver and Toronto stock exchanges. A PC-based product with simple charting capabilities, Omen II stillhas 200 users in Vancouver. Says Microstat CEO Fred Daniels ofthe earlier product: "It's a hybrid of a dumb and intelligentterminal."                            Not Dumb  With the NeXT platform serving as a base, the new Omen shouldbe anything but dumb. Intending to create a "financialinformation gateway," the company began designing Omen III twoyears ago, says Microstat chairman Wayne Crookes. Development onNeXT began last May.  But the NeXT platform differentiates Omen III from other brokersystems only in limited ways. Three Omen III features incorporateNeXT's voice and image processing capabilities: instead of beeps,limit alarms are voice-based; a client's voice can be recordedand stored in the system; and a picture of the client's face canbe scanned in or stored on video.  Other Omen III features include: simple and expanded quotes;order entry and order history; creation of forms; security accessand password lock; electronic mail, including electroniccommunication of voice, graphics and text; real-time andhistorical charting with dynamic updating; commission calculator;dynamically updated indices; automatic phone dial and audible orvisible reminder services; currency conversion; client user listsupdated with real-time information; dynamically updated lists ofsecurities ranked as they become more or less active; reportgeneration; and the Sybase relational database, which is offeredfree to NeXT buyers.  Omen III has two other real-time charting features: an intra-day bar chart with three-minute tick intervals and a 60-secondtick chart. The company has also developed "peak and dip" limitalarms, which alert the user to a stock that begins to go downafter steadily moving upwards, or vice versa. Unlike simple pricealerts, Omen III's limits are triggered by the price's rate ofchange versus current value.                       Development on NeXT  "We are not porting to Next but building an interface fromscratch," says Soheil Zargarpour, Microstat's chief engineer andresearch and development manager. He says the company chose todevelop the system on the NeXT platform because it was lookingfor object-oriented programming capabilities, a relationaldatabase manager, preferably Sybase, a multi-window environmentand powerful graphics. NeXT machines provide all these features.  The system Microstat plans to begin selling this spring isdesigned to handle feeds from a variety of vendors and exchangesand is currently negotiating contracts. It has already contractedto provide PC Quote Inc.'s data feed, which carries data from allNorth American exchanges and is broadcast via satellite at 19.2kilobits per second.  Feeds will be transmitted via satellite, telephone lines orcable television to a ticker plant designed by Microstat. Afault-tolerant version of the ticker plant runs on two 386microprocessors and two high-end NeXT computers with a 660megabyte hard disk drive and 16 megabytes of RAM. Microstat willoperate its own ticker plant for Vancouver-area customers. Theticker plant will also be available for purchase.                   Between RAM and a Hard Disk  The ticker plant converts exchange feeds into an Omen III feedand broadcasts it to a NeXT server at the user site. The serverwill be connected via ethernet LAN to "diskless" NeXTworkstations with 48-megabyte swap drives, Zargarpour says. Swapdrives allow memory to be shuffled between the RAM and the harddrive.  As a NeXT-based product, the system runs under UNIX and isconfigured in the Objective-C language, which Zargarpour saysallows easier maintenance and upgrading of the code.                           What NeXT?  Microstat is seeking five beta test sites for the new product.However, while the first commercial version of Omen III will beavailable only on NeXT, Microstat intends to port the product toother systems, which it will not name. The system will supportmultiple news services, but has yet to determine which will beoffered initially.  The company refuses to discuss the price of a fully configuredOmen III system, but it could get costly. At a recent talk in NewYork, Stephen Jobs said Next computers were selling at around$10,000 apiece, although those without optical disk drives can gofor about $2,000 less.  Nor has Microstat come to any firm decision about how to marketits product, although the company hints that it is negotiatingwith Businessland, which has the distribution rights to NeXT.Businessland is helping organize Microstat's presentation of OmenIII to New York brokers this week.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE MARKET DATA via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990MCGRAW-HILL ACQUIRESMUNI GIANT J.J. KENNY  McGraw-Hill Inc. has announced its intention to buy all theoutstanding shares of J.J. Kenny Co., a recognized leader inmunicipal bond brokerage and information services. The move putsKenny under the same umbrella as Standard & Poor's Corp., whichmarkets the Blue List Bond Ticker, a product that competes withKenny's information services.  The purchase includes both of Kenny's principal businesses,Kenny Information Systems Inc. and J.J. Kenny Drake Inc., Kenny'sbrokerage firm. Both operations will be added to McGraw-Hill'sFinancial Services Group, which includes S&P's Ratings Group, S&PMcGraw-Hill, DRI McGraw-Hill, The Tower Group and McGraw-HillSecurities Trading Inc. J. Kevin Kenny, the company chairman andchief executive officer, will report to Harold McGraw III,executive vice president at McGraw-Hill.  "Kevin Kenny is going to stay on [after the purchase]," saysMichael Beauchamp, executive vice president at Kenny. "Prettymuch business will be as usual....we don't anticipate any majorchanges."  Kenny Drake claims to be the U.S.'s largest interdealer brokerof municipal bonds, based on number of transactions and totaldollar volume. Kennybase, Kenny Information System's flagshipproduct, purportedly is used to clear 90% of all municipal bondtransactions among registered dealers and dealer banks.  Kenny Drake's broker screen system is used by dealers as atrading tool. A Kenny Drake screen, which can be leased fromKenny for $1,500 per month, displays live bids and offers fromthe municipal dealer market.                         Odd Bedfellows  But the buyout will make for odd bedfellows. Also under McGraw-Hill's wing is S&P and its Blue List products which compete withKennybase and Kenny Drake in the municipal bond informationbusiness. The Blue List Bond Ticker can be accessed throughTelerate Inc. terminals; it is also available through BloombergFinancial Networks.  Kenny says it isn't worried about the similarity of itsbusinesses with S&P's. "We don't see any overlap," saysBeauchamp. "[S&P] doesn't have a municipal data base -- that'sone of our core businesses -- and they don't have a brokerageunit, and that's our other core business." A spokesperson forMcGraw-Hill declined to comment.  "The Blue List, either on the ticker or through thepublication, tends to be more a library of offerings," says CathyCallender, vice president at Kenny. "We tend to have hotter, moretimely offerings."                       Development Goes On  The acquisition will not affect the ongoing efforts to enhancethe Kennybase bond information service, according to Beauchamp.In late 1990 Kenny is scheduled to release Kennybase II, anupgrade to this PC-based service that expands the number ofdescriptive data items for each bond from nine to 100. About1,100 clients use Kennybase.  Kennybase describes approximately 1.5 million municipal issues,and is updated as many as 14,000 times a day. Among the newdescriptive items to be included for each issue in Kennybase II(where applicable) are insurance descriptions, adjustable rateinformation, clearing eligibility, zero type, underwriterinformation, when-issued information, refunded bond descriptions,escrow and redemption descriptions.  The Kennybase system costs $175 per month, plus 25 cents perinquiry. The system runs in the DOS environment, as willKennybase II. Access to the Kennybase database is via dial-upphone line.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE MARKET DATA via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990LOTUS-INFOTECH DEAL FOR SIGNALAND QUOTREK FINALLY HAPPENS  After months of haggling and paper shuffling, Financial NewsNetwork, Inc. has bought Lotus Information Network Corp. (LINC)from Lotus Development Corp. As expected, FNN will merge LINC andits market data services with its smaller Data Broadcasting Corp.business (Micro Ticker Report, Sept. 5, 1989). FNN is 45-percentowned by New York-based Infotechnology Corp., which also ownsUnited Press International and other electronic informationventures.  The sale ends Lotus Development's five-year-old safari into themarket data business and consolidates three leading quoteservices aimed at the individual investor -- LINC's Signal andQuotrek and Data Broadcasting Corp.'s Marketwatch. Although thepurchase price wasn't announced, Lotus is thought to have soldLINC for between $10-$12 million, or almost twice the $6.25million it paid for the old Dataspeed business in 1985 (MTR,October 1985).  The combination of Signal, Marketwatch and Quotrek will serve areal-time subscriber base of more than 10,000, about evenly splitbetween the two PC-based services and the portable Quotrek. Thesesubscribers account for more than half of all non-professionalreal-time users of U.S. stock market data. (Marketwatch alsooffers a 15-minute delayed service and Signal offers end-of-daypricing.)  FNN/Infotech's plan is to split the existing Data BroadcastingCorp. into three pieces, the Marketwatch product, a networkservices company and a technology company. Scott Dinsdale, whowas named president of DBC after former president Joseph Taussigwas elevated to Infotech, will remain in charge of DBC's networkand technology operations. Current LINC management, headed byDouglas Smith, will run the market data services.  The combination looks positive for both firms. Instead of beingan also-ran, FNN/Infotech overnight becomes the market shareleader in the low-end real-time business. It also acquires itsown ticker plant, a solid marketing organization andrelationships with dozens of third-party software suppliers. Atthe same time, the LINC business will now be owned by a parentthat really wants to own it and will have access both toadditional Infotech content -- like UPI and Comtex -- and tohigher-bandwidth technology that will allow it to expand.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE MARKET DATA via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990STANDARD & POOR'S CORP. ANNOUNCESNEWS SERVICE AND CLIENT  After months of hedging, Standard & Poor's Corp. has announcedthe launch of a news service designed to compete with Dow JonesNews Service, (IMD, Nov. 27, 1989). St. Louis-based brokerageEdward D. Jones is the first announced subscriber to the S&Pservice.  Called S&P News, the service delivers business and financialnews to the brokerage community, a market that "has been relyingon a single source for news," says Jeffrey Bell, S&P group vicepresident for retail investor services. He says 7,000 companiesreport earnings and other news to the S&P news staff, who turnthe information into stories that can be "more quickly read than[those of] existing services." Unlike the Dow Jones service, hesays, S&P News "is not designed to be printed in a newspaper thenext day, but for real-time delivery and retrieval."  S&P is also competing with Dow Jones on price, charging up to40% less, Bell says. He refuses to discuss details but says S&P"prices on a per terminal and quantity basis." Says Bell: "Wethink it's necessary to provide a lower price alternative as animportant way for us to enter the business."                      Discount the Increase  Before volume discounts, Dow Jones charges $499 per month forthe first office, as well as monthly per-terminal fees of $21.50for news retrieval and $13.50 for scrolling news. Some of DowJones' recent price changes actually represent an increase. Newsretrieval charges have been raised by one dollar per terminal permonth, and the scrolling news charge has gone up fifty cents --according to sources at major firms.  Those sources also say Dow Jones is offering a discount priceplan -- the "90/20 plan" -- that offers incentives to take DowJones news in 100% of a firm's offices. Tim Turner, vicepresident for marketing and sales for Dow Jones' informationservices group, refuses to disclose details but confirms that thecompany is offering "volume discounts based on size of firm,number of terminals and length of contract." However, he saysdiscounts apply even if less than 100% of the customer's officestake Dow Jones, although in that case the customer would get adeeper discount.  Turner denies that the new discount policy has anything to dowith S&P's bargain rates, noting that Dow Jones has long competedwith Reuters and Knight-Ridder. Instead, he claims the discountsstem from "concerns on the Street for all costs" and says the newpricing policy accommodates the uncertainty about staff sizecurrently plaguing the brokerage community.                      He's Glad He Switched  Cost is a key reason Edward D. Jones chose to buy S&P's newsservice rather than the Broadtape, says Rich Malone, a partner incharge of the brokerage's data processing operation. Withoutdisclosing numbers, he says it was cheaper for the firm, whichhas a single broker in each of its 1,500 branch offices, to haveS&P's news service delivered directly to the brokerage's centralsystem, which then transmits the information, along withTelekurs' Ticker III feed, to branches.  Although its research and marketing departments use the DowJones service, Malone says it would have been more expensive forthe firm to offer that service to its brokers, because the vendorwould have charged each branch office for the service. The branchoffices were already getting Marketscope, the S&P real-timeelectronic stock news reporting service, but no full newsservice.  By redistributing the S&P service itself, Jones bypassesintermediate vendors. Both Automatic Data Processing Inc. andBeta Systems, which caters to regional brokerages, carry theservice. S&P is negotiating with other vendors, including QuotronSystems Inc. and ILX Systems Inc., says S&P's Bell.  Bell also says that while S&P headquarters houses 25 reportersdedicated to its news product, the service can actually draw onthe resources of 800 editorial staff worldwide, most of whomreport for specific McGraw-Hill publications. S&P News is mostlikely to draw on the information gathered by the 100 or soreporters who are part of McGraw-Hill News, particularly those inits Washington, D.C. bureau, Bell says. Each news service hasaccess to the other's stories and can choose to run them if theyare appropriate to its audience, Bell says. McGraw-Hill News isgeared to corporations rather than brokerages.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE MARKET DATA via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990REUTERS TO LAUNCH MONEY 2000BY END OF FIRST QUARTER  Reuters Holdings PLC will launch its digitally delivered Money2000 service worldwide at the end of the first quarter. Therelease is part of the company's efforts to migrate datadelivered over its aging Monitor network to its new IntegratedData Network (IDN).  Money 2000 is a foreign exchange and money markets service thatwill eventually carry all data currently held in the MonitorInternational Money Rates (IMR) database, as well as Reutersnews. Money 2000 upgrades, and eventually will replace, theReuter Monitor Money Rates service and the Reuter Monitor MoneyNews service.  Money 2000 will be delivered to standalone IDN terminals at 9.6kilobits/second. It will be delivered to clients' internaldistribution systems initially at 9.6 kilobits/second overReuters' IDN-based RQF data feed, which is slated for releaseearly this quarter (story below). Sarah Dunn, product manager forMoney 2000, says the service will be available over the 56kilobits/second Marketfeed 2000, which is also based on IDN,"slightly later."                    Enhancements After Launch  In its first phase, Money 2000 will deliver a subset of the IMRdatabase in logical form. This will comprise spot, forwards,deposits and cross rates for all major currencies. Reutersintends to add money market instruments to the service in aseries of "post-launch enhancements."  Until these enhancements are made, data not delivered inlogical form will be accessed in page format. Data, both record-and page-based, will be accessed in up to three "zones" on thesame screen. This capability will be available immediately tousers of dedicated terminals. Users receiving the service viaRQF, meanwhile, will have to wait until that feed has thecapability of delivering page-based data alongside logical data.  The record-page mix will be made possible by the use ofpreformatted displays or "tiles" on the user's screen. A userwill be able to place one tile, fed by the logical feed, in eachzone on his screen. A tile is eight to ten lines high and 80characters wide, Dunn says. The user can also place up to a pageof page-formatted data in a zone, depending on the size of thezone. Dunn says zone size depends on user preference. Inaddition, zones can be configured to hold users' own lists ofinstruments for limit-minding.                         His Latest Rate  Money 2000's logical, record-based format, Dunn says, will givethe user more flexibility over the old Monitor-delivered foreignexchange and money markets services, which use a page-basedformat. "For example, rather than a client having to retrieve theMonitor page and know that page code in advance in order to lookat a particular price," she says, "he could put in a code forDeutschemark (DEM=) to retrieve the latest spot rate." Money 2000will use Reuter Identification Codes, based on the Society forWorldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications' code, to accessrates. Money 2000 subscribers would also be able to feed logicaldata into local applications such as Microsoft Inc.'s Excel real-time spreadsheet.  In addition to the foreign exchange and money markets dataalready available via Monitor, Money 2000 will offer some futuresand options data from Reuters' Futures 2000 service. Money 2000will also feature precious metals and sovereign debt overviews.  Money 2000 continues Reuters' transition from Monitor to IDN.Previously, the two networks have been discrete in terms ofcontent, with IDN carrying equities and exchange-traded data andMonitor concentrating on the over-the-counter markets.  Reuters has high hopes for the service. Speaking last month atMediaweek '89, a yearly analysts meeting sponsored byPaineWebber Inc., Michael Reilly, Reuters' vice president,investor relations, said the company has more than 100,000terminals serving the money markets. "All of those are eligibleto be changed over to Money 2000," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE MARKET DATA via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990REUTERS' RQF, RMF WILL HAVETHREE-TIERED PRICING STRUCTURE  Reuters Holdings PLC's RQF and RMF digital feeds, scheduled forNorth American release early this year, will have the same three-tiered pricing structure as Reuters' other international datafeed products.  Reuters has scheduled North American release of RQF, the ReuterQuotation Feed, for very early this quarter. RQF is a record-based digital feed that provides a window into Reuters'Integrated Data Network-based Marketfeed 2000. Meanwhile, rolloutof RMF, the Reuter Monitor Feed, will depend on individualmanagers of Reuters' regional operations. RMF, also based on IDN,provides a similar window into page-oriented data that's alsocarried on the Reuter Monitor network.  Glenn Wasserman, Reuters' international data feed productsmanager, says the pricing structure for RQF and RMF will beapplicable worldwide. He says the structure breaks down intothree components.                    Multi-Level Configuration  The first component -- functionality -- depends on thebandwidth the user takes. For example, a feed with entry-levelconfiguration, Wasserman says, would provide simultaneous accessto a certain number of instruments in real time. A higher-levelconfiguration would give access to more instrumentssimultaneously, requiring a wider bandwidth, and thus would costmore. RQF can provide as many as 1,800 simultaneous updates toprices of up to 133,000 instruments. The feed's top speed is 9.6kilobits/second. RMF is also available at 4.8 kilobits/second.  The second component is a service charge, which variesaccording to the number of services a user is taking on hischosen delivery feed. For example, the charge would be lower if auser decides to take only Equities 2000 through RQF, rather thantaking additional IDN-based services such as the pending Money2000 (story, above).  Reuters will also charge a population fee, essentially aworkstation fee, for the two feeds. The fee will depend on thenumber of workstations accessing the feed. Wasserman says clientsare contractually obliged to report usage. Reuters will furthercharge clients if they redistribute RQF or RMF data to otherlocations.                         Monitor to IDN  The launch of RQF and RMF is part of Reuters' effort torationalize its data feed product line as it attempts tointegrate its IDN and Monitor networks. The end result will bethe dismantling of the Monitor network and the use of IDN asReuters' only network -- a move popular with investment analyststracking Reuters' fixed cost structure.  RQF is aimed at customers that don't require the breadth ofcoverage provided by Market-feed 2000. Also, RQF would beattractive to users without the resources to develop an internaldelivery system capable of handling such volume of data.  The feed initially will be record-based only, Wasserman says.But, as Reuters switches delivery of Monitor data to IDN, thecompany will make contributed data in page format available viaRQF. "The RQF will be the first device on the IDN network thatwill be able to supply both the IDN record-oriented exchange dataand what we have in the past delivered via Monitor -- thecontributed data," Wasserman says.  Eventually, Reuters will use RQF as its standard platform fordelivery of both record- and page-oriented data, althoughWasserman says it will continue to support any installedterminals receiving RMF or Monitor.  RMF is essentially an upgrade of Reuters' RDCDF feed that willallow the company to standardize its terminals worldwide on a386-based PC hardware platform. RMF offers similar functionalityto RDCDF, except that it allows users access to up to 100 pagesfrom the Monitor database concurrently, compared with 32 pagesvia RDCDF (MTR, May 1989).Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE MARKET DATA via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990LME BUYS QUOTE FEED SERVICEFROM REUTERS AFTER FEES BATTLE  After a protracted battle in which other vendors collectivelyaccused Reuters Holdings PLC of anti-competitive practices, theLondon Metal Exchange has opted to purchase the quote systemReuters developed for the LME. The LME will sell the feed tothird-party vendors for redistribution. The deal insures that byJune 1990, the system will deliver all prices simultaneously toall vendors, including Reuters.  After winning the bid to design and develop the LME's quotesystem, Reuters had proposed that all third party vendors wishingto distribute the feed pay Reuters a flat fee (Micro TickerReport July 24, 1989). Because off-the-floor trading informationwas to be collected using Reuters Monitor terminals, these priceswould have been available to Reuters customers sooner. Customersof other vendors would have had to wait for the LME computers toreceive and reroute the Reuters-supplied information.  Vendors quickly formed a coalition to oppose this arrangement,and their voices apparently were heard. Under the purchaseagreement finally reached between Reuters and the LME, othervendors will pay no fees to Reuters. The exchange fee schedulewill be finalized in the next three weeks, and Reuters will notget a cut, says Gerard Buckley, the LME's market informationmanager.  Spokesman for the vendor group, David Taylor, could not bereached for comment, but a source at one vendor says that "it's aclassic case of Reuters going in and grabbing a monopoly. They'vedone it before and they'll no doubt do it again."                         The Metal Feed  The system compiles LME futures prices from interfirm telephonetrading and from two open-outcry sessions, called Ring and Kerb,that occur in both the morning and afternoon. Open outcry pricesare collected by LME staff members on the floor, while telephonetrades are entered into Reuters Monitor terminals by eleven LMEmember firms. The data is processed on two LME-owned HewlettPackard 9000 Series microcomputers, one of which runs in stand-bymode.  In the new system, the only way Reuters monitor customers canget telephone market prices is from the LME feed. The ReutersMonitor terminals used to collect upstairs trade data have beenmodified so that the prices are transferred directly to the LME'sprocessor rather than to other Reuters Monitor terminals on theReuters network. The LME says all vendors, including Reuters,will receive the feed at exactly the same time. The ReuterMonitor terminals used for price input have also been modified toreduce data entry errors.  Options prices on the LME's metal contracts will eventually beincluded in the feed, Buckley says. Options are only traded bytelephone.                          More Sources  The LME is the largest metals exchange in the world, tradingcopper, zinc, lead, aluminum, nickel and tin. Founded in 1877, ithas never had a quote system of its own. Interested parties hadto subscribe to vendors, like Reuters and Knight-Ridder UnicomLtd., that collected the data from the floor, or from market-makers, such as Rudolf Wolff & Co.

The conferees, though, are expected todelay full deregulation of cable TV rates until three yearsafter enactment, backing away from the bills' original plan.The legislation largely undoes the Cable Act of 1992, whichimposed rate regulation, and ends the cable-telco cross-ownership ban, a key part of the Cable Act of 1984.But another part of the Cable Act of 1984 sparked the FCC tocreate its "must carry" rule requiring cable operators to carrylocal broadcast channels.  The rule - an attempt to ensure thenewer medium would not eliminate broadcasting - was reaffirmedearlier this month by the U.S. District Court for Washington,D.C.Cable operators, led by Turner Broadcasting, took theirchallenge of the rule all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,which last year remanded the case to the U.S. District Court fora rehearing.  The High Court, in a 5-4 vote, said the lowercourt had not received enough proof for the FCC's case thatbroadcasters would be harmed.Significantly, the four of the five justices in the majoritywanted the case not to be remanded but overturned outright as aviolation of cable operator's First Amendment Rights.  Now, theHigh Court will get a second chance to do just that, sincethere's no question whether Turner will appeal the 2-1 ruling ofthe district court's three-judge panel.Writing for the majority, District Court Judge Stanley Sporkinsaid there was no other alternative available to the FCC thanmust-carry.  Antitrust law, he said, is time consuming andleased access is costly while "many of the stations invoking themust-carry protections are economically vulnerable."  Nor wouldan FCC complaint procedure fit the bill, he said, citing the"enormous administrative burden" of such a process.Sporkin dismissed the challenge of the rule as an uncompensatedtaking by the government in violation of the Fifth Amendment.But, when he considered whether the rule is a content-relatedrestriction requiring strict scrutiny for its First Amendmentimpact, he admitted the rule comes "very close."But, he added, "we do not believe that they [at the FCC] crossthe line."The very day the district court released its opinion, theconferees on Capitol Hill held their second meeting in as manyweeks and adopted a set of changes to the vastly differenttelecom bills passed by the House and Senate this summer.Regarding the bills' language on deregulating cable operators,the conferees chose the House bill as their mode, but loosenedits provisions even more.Conversely, they imposed tougher conditions on cable TV's futurecompetitors - the telephone companies.The House telecom bill, H.R. 1555, keeps the FCC frominvestigating a cable rate complaint until 3 percent of thecable system's subscribers have complained - the FCC now swingsinto action on one complaint - and it orders the FCC to resolverate complaints in 90 days and to set only minimal standards forset-top converter boxes.  But the conferees changed H.R. 1555'slanguage to raise the definition of a "small city" - one wherethe cable operator immediately escapes rate regulation - from35,000 to 50,000.That, said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W. Va., will only aggravatePresident Clinton's concerns that the bill goes too far on cablerate deregulation.  The president has threatened a veto, citingthat very concern.Regarding telco-provided video, the conferees also hewed to theHouse language, but again with big revisions.  Although H.R.1555 would have let telcos operate "video platforms" such asvideo dialtone (VDT) networks under reduced regulation, theconferees instead required VDT-type networks to conform to amodified version of the Title VI rules governing cable TV.  Atelco won't have to get local franchise agreements, but willhave to make at least two-thirds of its capacity available tounaffiliated programmers.That's the very sort of "must carry" rule cable operatorsprotest.  Telcos say it will rob them of much of the opportunityto cash in on programming, the source of the real money in VDT.While deregulating cable TV, the conferees also gave a bigbenefit to cable's old nemesis, the broadcasters.  The latestchanges make broadcasters the only ones able to receive licensesfor the 6 Mhz of spectrum set aside by the FCC for "advancedtelevision (ATV)" -even though the spectrum also can be used forpaging or mobile data.  The spectrum is valued at $35 billion to$100 billion but the conferees eliminated language from the billthat would have the spectrum auctioned.As for broadcasters' existing analog spectrum, which the FCCwould like to regain so that it can be auctioned, the confereeseliminated any criteria from the bill for determining when thespectrum must be returned.The conferees are deregulating cable TV, in part, so that it mayacquire the capital needed to build networks to compete withlocal phone companies.  The Cable Act of 1992 was said by theindustry to have hurt revenues, but the FCC last week issued areport on cable industry competition that claims the industry"posted strong growth over the past year."The report said subscribership has increased by 2.5 million tojust under 60 million and average capacity has increased to thepoint where 96 percent of operators provide more than 30channels.This hurts the industry's argument that it is suffering underthe increased rules.The report also concludes that cable TV is still "the primarydistributor of multichannel programming to consumers," meaningthe FCC found there was only limited competition from digitalbroadcast satellite (DBS) services or telcos offering videodialtone.  It noted cable subscribership "continues to dwarf"the combined subscribership of all competing services combined.It also pointed to a increase in horizontal concentration ofcable systems, meaning that operators are consolidating,particularly on a regional basis.  The industry now is"moderately concentrated," it asserted.  About half of all 129national programming services are vertically integrated -meaning they also own a network - said the FCC, noting that thistotal of programmers was up from 106 the previous year.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE TV STRATEGIES via NewsNetDECEMBER 25, 1995FCC'S 214 COFFERS DWINDLE AS AMERITECH YANKS ITS PERMITSWhat once was a beanstalk-like stack of Section 214 filingssprouting at the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC)Common Carrier Bureau, now is fast dwindling to a mere mound.Ameritech earlier this month relented its Section 214 permits -authorization the telcos need to obtain before they can beginbuilding video dialtone (VDT) networks - just weeks before theyexpired.  Current FCC regulations mandate that a telco act onits permits within a year of its approval.The FCC last December approved Ameritech's five applications toconstruct VDT networks that would serve 1.2 million homes in itsservice region.  Yet the telco, which has been plowing aheadwith plans to operate as a franchise cable operator, for now hasall but abandoned any near-term VDT plans."Right now it's full speed ahead with cable.  There were twomain reasons for the withdrawal," Ameritech spokesman Dave Onaktells ITVS.  "We have been getting increasing community supportfor us to operate as a cable franchise operator.  And the FCCstill has not finalized their VDT rules."Ameritech currently has notched eight franchise agreements withthe local authorities primarily in the outlying areas ofDetroit.  The telco also has agreements with the Chicago suburbof Glendale Heights and the Cleveland suburb of Berea.  Inaddition, it has just begun the franchise process in Chicago toprovide service in that city's south side (ITVS Nov. 27, 1995).Onak says Ameritech continues with its brisk construction pacedespite the fact that the FCC has yet to approve theapplications.  Additionally, Illinois cable operators are suingthe telco and the authorities in Glendale Height.Nevertheless, Ameritech intends to begin offering programmingservice during the first half of 1996, Onak tells ITVS.  "We'vegot a court ruling that says we can do so, so why not?"Programming will be selected and packaged by the Americastconsortium in which Ameritech is partnered with BellSouth, GTE,SBC Communications and Disney.  Americast thus far has signedagreements with Encore, Time Warner, Turner, Viacom and otherprogrammers (ITVS Dec. 11, 1995), and the original package willcomprise about 80 to 90 analog channels.Ameritech is in engaged in franchise discussions with anadditional 40 communities across the Midwest, Onak says.  Thetelco has no plans to attempt to provide cable service outsideof its five-state region.  "We've got enough to keep us busy inour own backyard," he says.During the past year a handful of telcos - including BellAtlantic and U S West -  have amended, and then outright pulledtheir applications for commercial VDT before they ever got tothe approval stage at the commission.  Of concern is the rapidlychanging technological landscape and the commission's lack ofclarity on just how, when and where the telcos can operate VDTservice.Bell Atlantic in the late spring withdrew two of its Section214s and currently has only one 214 application pending, whichseeks to provide VDT service over a switched digital videonetwork in Florham, N.J.  The application was filed nearly threeyears ago and spokesman Harry Mitchell tells ITVS the telco isletting it sit because it includes up-to-date technology. BellAtlantic has no plans to file any other Section 214s in the nearfuture."The wild card is the federal legislation," Mitchell tells ITVS."We are prepared to make the filings if necessary but we are notgoing to tip our hand if we don't have to."The FCC says it will finalize its VDT regulations by early 1996if the federal government does not pass telecom reformlegislation making it a moot point.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE TV STRATEGIES via NewsNetDECEMBER 25, 1995THOMSON BRIGHTENS STARSIGHT'S UNIVERSE WITH $25M INVESTMENTOn-screen program guide developer StarSight Telecast Inc. got ahefty shot in the arm last week when Thomson Electronics agreedto invest $25 million in the company, incorporate its technologyinto its products, and engage in a joint marketing effort.Thomson's investment, for which it gets 3.33 million shares ofStarSight common stock, buys the company a 13 percent interestin StarSight, which also is owned by Viacom, Cox Communications,Tribune Co., Time Warner and Providence Journal Co.The proposed agreement also gives Thomson the right to acquireup to 1 million additional StarSight shares during the next twoyears at $7.50 per share and up to 1 million additional sharesof common stock during the next three years at $10 per share.Under terms of the agreement, Thomson - whose U.S. consumerelectronics interests include RCA, GE and Proscan -  willincorporate StarSight technology into selected product lines.The cost to deploy StarSight ranges from $10 to $30 per piece ofequipment, according to Larry Wangberg, president and CEO ofFremont, Calif.-based StarSight."Over time, as the cost of the memory goes down, this cost willbe reduced," he adds.  "Ultimately in the digital world thedeployment of StarSight will concern just the downloading of acode, and that price, of course, will be very attractive."Wangberg says the partnership greatly bolsters one ofStarSight's three core businesses - consumer electronics.  Theother areas of concentration are wholesale distribution andlicensing, which the company recently got into.StarSight currently has agreements with 11 other electronicsmanufacturers, and Wangberg says he expects they will reactfavorably to the Thomson deal."I expect they are going to see this as positive news because itgreatly strengthens StarSight's financial position and ensuresthat our business will continue to grow," he says.  Wangbergalso anticipates the Thomson investment, coupled with the recent$5 million investment in the company by its current partners,will carry StarSight through 1996.   He declines to project whenStarSight will stop bleeding red ink.As part of the new agreement, StarSight and Thomson will jointlymarket StarSight-equipped Thomson products.  "In some areas wewill be spending more money, and in other areas the spendingwill be coming down," Wangberg says.  "It is very dependent onthe mix of revenue and the timing."Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE TV STRATEGIES via NewsNetDECEMBER 25, 1995AT&T, HEWLETT-PACKARD PARTNER ON BROADBAND SOFTWARE PLATFORMIn a move Carly Fiorina, president of AT&T Network Systems NorthAmerica, called "creating a new center of gravity for theindustry," AT&T and Hewlett-Packard last week outlined a plan tojointly develop turnkey broadband network solutions for publicand private wireline and wireless networks, includinginteractive television.Aside from developing technology and products for ITV - whichwill come later down the line - the companies together intend tocreate an open network software platform and developapplications to run on it, according to Willem Roelandts, seniorvice president and general manager of HP's computer systemsorganization.AT&T Network Systems, which next year will split off from AT&Tas part of a separate systems and technology company, just weeksago at the Western Cable Show announced it was teaming with HP,and cable modem developers Hybrid Networks and Intel.  Thecooperative plans to set specifications for interoperability anddevelop products for high-speed PC delivery.The announcement already has received "positive responses" fromTime Warner, Comcast and several other cable operators, Fiorinasays.The new AP agreement advances their relationship much further.The first fruits of the deal will see both companies immediatelyselling  high-speed cable modems.  Fiorina says within sixmonths the team also will be building products and services,eventually to include home shopping, video and telephony, arounda common protocol using HP's "Openview" and AT&T's "BaseWorx"software.  The companies are working closely with CableLabs toensure their standard is the one adopted by the industry,Roelandts says.Within the next year, AT&T and HP also will introduce advancedheadend equipment and additional integrated data-managementsoftware.   "We see the potential of this relationship extendinginto the future beyond next year and we have high hopes for whatelse we can do together," Fiorina says.The companies together are taking a different tack than othercompetitors, including Motorola, IBM and Microsoft, in a moveRoelandts and Fiorina say is by design."Microsoft is driven by a very different view of how theindustry will evolve, and I am relatively confident that ourview is backed by a lot of network service providers out therethat have invested a lot in their networks," Fiorina says."There is not much value to be derived from merely providing apipe with no value associated with it."Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE TV STRATEGIES via NewsNetDECEMBER 25, 1995YOUR CHOICE TV  TO LAUNCH SINGLE-CHANNEL PPV SERVICEYour Choice Television (YCTV) is planning to launch a single-channel pay-per-view version of its time-shifted program serviceaimed at making it easier for cable systems with limited channelcapacity to offer YCTV.The new proposal, which will offer a limited quantity of populartelevision shows, is the most low-tech level of Your Choiceservice.  YCTV also offers a more  robust multichannel PPVversion of time-shifted programming and an application for real-time video on-demand (VOD), which primarily has seen use only intrials.The single-channel service will come in six-hour blocks ofprogramming and will be delivered via YCTV's satellite, whichhas been up and running since April.  Suggested retail price forthe new service will be 99 cents, according to Randall McCurdy,YCTV's vice president of sales and distribution, who says theprice "is low enough that people don't think about the cost buthigh enough that they associate some value with it."McCurdy tells ITVS Your Choice already has agreements in placewith several cable operators for the new service, but declinesto offer specifics."We see this as a migration path," McCurdy tells ITVS.  "A lotof our subscribers have systems that are currently in severallevels.  Some have real digital systems that they are testingthe delivery VOD on, some have systems ready for near video on-demand and some are on the tail-end of the rebuild and arelocked into one channel for a good while.  This is a scaleablesolution."McCurdy says the lower-level service is a good way for YCTV toreach cable systems that might otherwise not be able to use itsprogramming.  "Initially there are a lot more operators with onechannel, so we will be able to reach a lot more people with thisfirst," he says.As for YCTV's foray into the market, McCurdy says the company ispretty much finished with participating in the trials of thecable companies and telcos for now.  "We've basically closeddown the trial mode.  We are focusing on commercial deploymentnow," he says.Back to Headline List WT03-B10-16IA087-000629-B024-105http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/pb47.html 205.156.212.5 19970122041143 text/html 42102HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:09:47 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:22 GMTContent-length: 41915Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/pb47.html Sample Issue Copyright INTERACTIVE VIDEO NEWS via NewsNet January 8, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES INTERNET LIKELY TO DRIVE BUSINESS AGAIN THIS YEAR Economic realities signal shift from interactive television (702 words) DBS COMPANIES SEEKING MARKETSHARE FROM CABLE CATV operators keep upgrading to keep ahead (815 words) TELEPHONY, CABLE PROPELSALES OF VOD SERVERS Storage demands are expected to maintain impact on prices (437 words) CHIP INTEGRATION, 3D, COMMUNICATIONS EXPECTED TO STORM MULTIMEDIA MARKET (481 words) MARKET FORECAST: ELECTRONIC BANKING COMPANIES POSITIONING TO DRAW IN CONSUMERS Pricing models, security remain thorny issues (639 words) BEHIND THE HEADLINES SKEPTICS OF ELECTRONIC BANKING WERE MORE RECEPTIVE LAST YEAR (953 words) INTERACTIVE NEWS IN BRIEF BELL LABS TOUTS VIDEO DEVICE (116 words) DEALS FOR YOUR CHOICE TV (61 words) CATV SERVICE GROWTH AHEAD (123 words) TV SETTOP BOX TESTED (60 words) INTERNET SHAKEOUT PREDICTED (85 words) ALPHASTAR PLANS NEW SERVICE (101 words) PA.

The on-rush of the Internet through the computing platform meantthat interactive services predicted to thrive through the televisionfound a more immediate home.  Interestingly, the clarion call in 1996of purists in the interactive television industry is that the Internetis an intermediate step to true interactivity.       Observers say many issues are on the table for 1996, such as theimpending passage of the telecommunications bill now in Congress andother policy issues, such as privacy.  In addition, many are waitingto see whether cable modems will be deployed this year as cableoperators are predicting.       But most of all, said Peter Waldheim, chief executive officer ofthe Interactive Television Association, Washington, D.C., the"seamless process between PC applications and interactive television"will continue unabated.      "We'll see a big push in the high-speed cable modem market todeliver full-motion video to the Internet and create enormousopportunities over the PC that don't exist right now.  And that, ofcourse, leads directly to the TV set," Waldheim said.      Many in the industry were caught off guard by the drama of theshift toward the Internet and general level of interactive activity,said John Hall, managing director, John Hall and Associates.     "It's sort of been a Wild West year, '95," Hall said. " I think alot of us were taken by surprise by how much happened in '95."     Indeed, Waldheim of ITA said companies are doing more trialing ofinteractivity now than two years ago, despite some high-profile testpostponements.      Another key indicator of industry changes in 1995 was that thebase price the industry puts on bringing interactive services to thehome has dropped to about $1,000 per home, compared with theassumption that an economic model would have to be between$3,000-$5,000, Waldheim said. Thomas Cardy, senior vice president, Communications Equity Associates,Tampa, Fla., said economic realities have led the shift toInternet-based applications.      "Right now there's a proven market for online and computer basedservices,   to the extent that you can interact and people are willingto pay for it now," Cardy said.  "There's a business there.  There'ssome question as to how you make money from an interactive televisionservice right now."     Cardy said to a large extent interactive television is caught ina generational quagmire, with older people satisfied to use theirtelevision sets to watch TV.      "The folks who have the propensity to interact over someelectronic link, most of them already have a computer now.  The folksthat just have a TV probably don't have the propensity (to interact),"Cardy said.      "Hall of Hall and Associates said it is doubtful that themomentum built up in 1995 by the Internet's World Wide Web can besustained this year.      "I don't think it's possible or even healthy for the Internet andaccess providers to grow at the same pace in '96 as they did the lastseven or eight months," Hall said.  "One of the critical issues in 96,particularly for advertisers, is people are going to take a look atthe money they're putting in the web sites and take a look at thebottom line and see what what's working."        Analyst Connie Luecke, who follows regional telephone companiesfor Duff & Phelps, Chicago, said many of those companies ae looking atmore immediate profit opportunities, such as in long distance, thatinteractive television doesn't offer.         "I think they [RBOCs] have other things on their plate rightnow that they're more interested in and more involved in," Lueckesaid.  "From a perspective of what is going to be their bigger focusand what's going to provide the most revenues and earnings over thenext few years, their focus is going to be long distance."    Robert Smith, president of the Interactive Services Association,said companies will need to keep any eye toward regulatory issues in1996.    "You're going to see an increasing scrutiny of this industry byfederal and state government and legislators and regulators," Smithsaid. "The online Internet industry is goingto have to deal with public policy makers in a very big way."Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE VIDEO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996DBS COMPANIES SEEKING MARKETSHARE FROM CABLECATV operators keep upgrading to keep ahead     The cable television industry spent its recent past trying to barthe door to the euphoria of telephone companies inching their way inon its turf through the lure of interactive TV.But the rise of the Internet as an intermediate step to fullinteractivity and the promise of quicker cash payoffs in segments suchas long distance have slowed some telecos' charge into video.     Does that mean cable operators can retreat a bit into 1996 fromthe threats to their bottomlines? Hardly.  Another relatively nascentindustry, direct broadcast satellites--those 18-inch dishes thatmeasure smaller than a patio barbeque--are giving cable a seriousscramble. DBS is "clearly an exploding market," said Harold Spielman, chiefexecutive officer of market researcher McCollum Spielman Worldwide,Great Neck, N.Y.  And according to the Satellite Broadcasting &Communications Association, 20 million U.S. homes will have satelliteservice by 2000.    "We know that RCA, for instance, has had difficulty just keeping upon the manufacturing end of their systems, Spielman said, noting thatDBS street prices have dropped over recent months to below the$600-mark for the equipment.  "I suspect we'll see the prices comedown more."Fastest-Seller in History     The largest DBS provider DirecTV Inc., a unit of HughesElectronic Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., for instance, unabashedlycalls DBS "the fastest selling consumer electronics product inhistory."  Linda Brill, DirecTV director of communications, said theservice is up to 1.1 million subscribers after going nationwide onlyin October 1994.     DBS companies say they beat cable in choice, price andvariety--offering some 175 channels, including 60 pay-per-viewchannels, and $2.99 movies every half hour.  And sports packages, suchwith public policy makers in a very big way."     The onslaught from DBS isn't expected to stop anytime soon. EchoStar Communications Corp., Englewood, Colo., successfully launchedits satellite into orbit Dec. 28, 1995, marking its corporate remakefrom large to 18-inch dishes.     "Our buy rates are 150 to 200 percent; cable is 30 percent,"chimed Brill.  "Cable has had a monopoly now in this country for 20odd years and consumers have been chomping at the bit for analternative."Cable Acknowledges Threat   Steve Effros, president of the industry group CableTelecommunications Association, Fairfax, Va., concedes that DBS hasposed a competitive challenge, but one that is no different than, say"Ford is...to General Motors."   Effros contends that cable and its 55 million households in theUnited States haven't lost households to DBS, but that DBS largely hasbeen a rural phenomena where people don't have cable access.      "We have not seen any significant reduction in the numbers ofcable homes," Effros said. "Indeed, we've had the largest increases inthe last five years since DBS started.  You could try to suggestthat...we would have even larger increases if it hadn't been for DBS.But I don't know if that's true."     Effros said upgrading has been a way of life for the cableindustry in staying topical and meeting competitive challenges fromall rivals.        The key hardware announcement at the Western Show--that giant,multiple system operators Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. andTime Warner Inc. invested $175 million to purchase 350,000 MotorolaInc. CyberSURFR modems for initial installation in April 1996--showedthe industry's resolve to sniff out immediate cash opportunities whileit awaits interactive TV.     And, for instance, Cablevision Systems Corp., recently announced a$300 million investment in a fiber-optic telecommunications system innortheast Ohio that will bring video-on-demand, computer connectivityand interactive services.Always Upgrading               "We're always upgrading," Effros said. "This is just a constantinfrastructure process.  We can't move as fast as an industry thatjust starts off with a given technology."    A recent study from Frost & Sullivan estimates that expendituresfor cable associated hardware and technology services will grow byabout 6 percent per year to 1999 to $2.36 billion.      Effros said much is riding on the cable industry's development ofmodem technology, as a way to help beat back DBS "as soon as we startinterconnecting computers via broadband systems because it's somethingDBS can't do."Industry Must Do More    Spielman of McCollum Spielman Worldwide said the satellite industrymust do more to explain to consumers what it has to offer.        "I think that the service deliverers have done such a terriblypoor job of explaining in their advertising what this is all about.The consumer really does not know," he said.    Spielman said DBS marketing is reminiscent of the "obscure"advertising of home video cassette recorders when they were introducedsome 15 years ago.        "I think that's the same situation with this," Spielman said. "People do not know what a dish will do, what they will get from it.They have no perspective on cost."    Additionally, as new companies see dollars signs in DBS, somequestion whether rivalries among the satellite firms companies willstunt the industry's growth."Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE VIDEO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996TELEPHONY, CABLE PROPELSALES OF VOD SERVERS Storage demands are expected to maintain impact on prices     Telephone and cable television companies will be the two leadingsegments that will drive the sales of video-on-demand servers through2000, a research report says.     Sales of servers, which initially will be priced high because oftheir storage needs, will increase from $131 million in 1994 to morethan $1.3 billion in 2000, according to the report,"Video-On-Demand--Technology and Economics," from  Hodge ComputerResearch.     Each segment has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, thereport states.     "Due to recent legislation allowing telcos to deliver videoprogramming, they will become very large players in this arena," itstates.  "They will be able to deliver programming to theirsubscribers on their own telephone lines. [These lines] may be used tocarry normal telephone traffic simultaneously with the delivery ofvideo."     There is no reason to believe the telephone companies cannot be aformidable force in video services, the report says.  They presentlyare delivering programming in numerous test locations--and thebarriers to telco program provision are rapidly falling.      Telcos also have "direct connections to nearly every home in theUnited States, or at least every one that would be a candidate for payper view (PPV) Interactive TV," according to the report, released toIVN's sister publication Video Technology News.     Cable operators, meanwhile, already have a large installed baseof video service subscribers.  The report estimates that there are58.8-million cable households in the United States.  They are servedby 11,217 cable operators.    "Only a few firms currently offer ITV services, and those only ona trial basis," the report says.  "Total subscribers are estimated atfewer than 5,000.  Of these, we estimate approximately 2,000 areserved by massive banks of VCRs into which cassettes are manuallyinserted in response to the customer's telephone call."    The percentage of cable subscribers who also have bought payservices has declined steadily since 1988, when 85 percent of cablesubscribers (42.4 million) bought pay services, according to thereport.  By 1993 this percentage had decreased to 72.6 percent. (Because of the increase in TV homes, the actual number of paysubscribers increased to 42.7 million.)      Video servers initially will be priced very high due to theimmense amounts of disk storage and RAM memory required to deliverhundreds of movies to thousands of subscribers, according to thereport.  The two most significant cost factors in a video server arethe disk farm on which the video programs are stored and the RAM usedto buffer the video data prior to transmission, the report explained.

But don't anticipate major changes on the multimedia landscapebefore the second half of the year, according to key manufacturers andindustry analysts, who spoke with Multimedia Week Editor JudithAbrams.    The most visible multimedia enhancement expected in the softwareand chip businesses will come in the form of 3-D games.    "We see 3D permeating the graphics world, offering a slew offeatures and performance that just aren't available today," said KenWirt, vice president of marketing, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc. "By the end of the year, you'll probably see a significant number ofPC systems come 3-D enabled."                        More consolidation in the chip industry, with companies attemptingto buy each other and integrate several functions onto a single chip,is expected in 1996, with companies that have strong markets in onearea (audio, video or communications), trying to expand.    The current trend is to combine 2-D, 3-D and digital video, butmore functions could be on the way.    Whether new chip designs make it to the motherboard is anotherquestion.    Intel Corp. is expected to deliver its MMX initiative, anenhancement of its next-generation processor with multimediaextensions, sometime in 1996. However, "I don't think it will be readyuntil the second half of 1996," said Richard Chang, an analyst withBear Stearns & Co.     Cable modems are expected to impact the CD-ROM as a means ofdelivering content, but they will not threaten the disc business in1996.    "The idea of delivering the kind of graphics we build into a gamethrough the Net and high-speed modems is at the moment a fairy tale,"said Ben Tenn, vice president of marketing for Activision Inc.  "Itcan take you two days to download the video we put on a couple ofCDs."    Diamond's Wirt forecasts 1996 as a year in which transmissioncompanies will begin work on new services, but delivering service isanother story.    Expect more advances on the Internet and in other kinds of modemtechnology.  More PC manufacturers are expected to add digitalsimultaneous voice and data modems (DSVD) to their products.    Despite budget increases, CD-ROM prices are coming down.    "Everybody's very concerned about the lower-end price points." saidRobert Peterson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc.  "The averageprice will go down because of the growth in the budget category. It'sgoing to continue to sell."    Meantime, multimedia PC manufacturers are expected to continue todrop prices, but a high-end, niche category that emerged in late 1995will continue.    "There is a market for higher-end, upscale game machines that werepopular during Christmas," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst withInternational Data Corp.  "We will see more focus on the $1,500 pricepoints, but manufacturers will try to keep them up and refreshfeatures.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE VIDEO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996COMPANIES POSITIONING TO DRAW IN CONSUMERSPricing models, security remain thorny issues     As the delivery of interactive service made a sharp turn in 1995toward the computer and Internet--and for now away from thetelevision--the star of electronic banking suddenly has never shinedso brightly.           Financial institutions, interactive services companies andsoftware developers all are positioning themselves to get electronicbanking in the forefront of consumers' psyche.          Toward the end of last year, Intuit Inc. and America Onlineagreed to offer banking to AOL members in the first half of 1996.  AndMicrosoft Corp. outlined its plans for banking software in December. On the interactive television side, Barnett Banks in Florida signed upwith Time Warner's Full Service Network to create a so-called"virtual" banks in the Orlando trial.       Procedures, pricing models and security concerns all must beworked out this year, but companies that deliver electronic bankingservices say the potential for consumer acceptance is high, based onhigh consumer reliance on automated teller machines and voice responsesystems, experts said.          "What we're beginning to see is sort of a seamless processbeginning with banks using PC applications for interactive bankingthat will lead to interactive television banking," said PeterWaldheim, chief executive officer of the Interactive TelevisionAssociation, Washington, D.C., which plans to release a study in thefirst quarter of the year, "Interactive Banking at Home '96."       "1996 will be a terrific year in terms of expanding the numbersof banks now beginning to map their banks' future in electronicmedia," Waldheim said.    Indeed, many of the nation's major banks and financial servicescompanies, including Citibank, Wells Fargo and American Expresspublicly stated last year that they would go a step further and offerfree electronic banking access.     "It's really not about the financial institutions, it's reallyabout consumers and first making them aware and giving them a goodoffer.  By good offer, I mean free," said Matt Lawlor, chairman andchief executive officer of Online Resources and Communications Corp.,McLean, Va.        Lawlor said pricing will be vital to consumer acceptance ofhome banking.  Three pricing models are emerging, he said.  "If youwant the consumer in masses, then the pricing has to be down there. Ifit's a bill payment then it ought to be down there where the cost of astamp is," Lawlor said.           Harold Spielman, chief executive officer of market researcherMcCollum Spielman Worldwide, Great Neck, N.Y., however, cautionsagainst euphoria over electronic banking. "This [electronic banking]is one of those things where it seems to me its time for a piece ofgood research on what people are actually doing or not doing.  It'stotally vague right now," Spielman said.       Catherine Corby, director of electronic delivery strategy forBarnett Banks, Jacksonville, Fla., agreed that in 1996 banks will needto show consumers how electronic banking will benefit them.     Telecommunications Research Inc., an Arlington, Va., researcher,predicts that about 5 million U.S. subscribers will be banking onlineby 2005.     A key issue to pushing electronic banking is deciding whichinteractive services and software companies to partner with.       That presents a challenge for the banks since in the past theyhave gone it alone when it came to innovation, ITA's Waldheim said.      "One of the things that is very exciting about interactivity,particularly interactive TV when it comes about, is that it will be upto the cable company or the telephone or the platform to market thebank to a certain degree. It's in their interest that banks on theirplatforms are successful," Waldheim said.     Security of accounts and transactions remains an issue, but manyindustry officials believe that is easily and ultimately solvablethrough marketing since consumers typically have confidence in theirfinancial institutions.     " As the banks move forward, they have systems to address thesecurity issues," Online Resources' Lawlor said. "What the consumerwill get is the confidence of their institution." Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE VIDEO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996SKEPTICS OF ELECTRONIC BANKING WERE MORE RECEPTIVE LAST YEAR    As director of electronic delivery strategy for Barnett Banks,Florida's largest banking company, Catherine Corby spearheaded theJacksonville-based institution's recent inclusion in Time WarnerCable's interactive television trial, Full Service Network, inOrlando.    In an interview with Interactive Video News Editor Marvin Greene,Corby takes issue with electronic banking models proffered by softwarecompanies and says financial institutions need to put the technologyon consumers' front burners.IVN: What was 1995 like for electronic banking, and what's ahead forthis year?  Corby: I think the skeptics were finally driven into seclusion [in1995]. The key for really breaking out for the consumer is when we arereally using our PCs to receive mail.  Not just turning the PC on onceevery two weeks, but having it become a vital part of our lives.      At the point that merchants can deliver bills electronically toconsumers on their PCs that are integrated with their financialservices programs or interactive services that they're working on, atthat point I think home banking will be prevalent.  Until then, Ithink it's going to take customers with patience who are willing toget around or overlook some of the shortcomings with the currentservices, or institutions that simply don't overpromise what theycan't deliver.     What I've learned from consumers after working with interactiveservices for 15 years in the financial services world is if you do apoor implementation of a technology, you set that opportunity backseveral years because consumers have long memories about what didn'twork.  And it's hard to convince them it's better now.IVN: Explain how electronic banking is going to work on the FullService Network in Orlando with Time Warner.Corby: What we've tried to do is to create the same kind of anenvironment that you have when you come into one of our currentbanking stores, from the perspective that you learn about us, youlearn about our values, you learn about our products and servicesthrough the merchandising that we do.    When you come into our venue on the Full Service Network you willbe presented with the opportunity to walk around and browse as youmight in a store, or to go very quickly to the specific area where youwant to conduct a specific transaction.  We don't force you into onemode or the other. The customer chooses...all in a virtualenvironment. IVN: Your model of electronic banking differs from that of softwarecompanies like Intuit and Microsoft?  What do you think of theirapproach?Corby:  If we keep going down the model that Intuit, for example, issetting out, then the personal finance software becomes the heart ofthe banking relationship.  And the information for any one financialinstitution gets filled in.  In that environment, home banking becomesdefined as paying my bills, seeing my balances.  That is not a broadelectronic delivery service in the home.  That is a transactionservice.      For the financial institutions, if we go and accept that model anddon't challenge it and try to build more consumer value, then I thinkwe're going to be working ourselves into a very narrow place into thehome in the world of electronic commerce.  I think we have the chancetoday, and that's why we got involved with Time Warner, to develop amuch more comprehensive service, one that really is an electronicstore.IVN:  You have been quoted previously as saying home banking has to be"engaging, informative and fun."  How do you make banking fun?  Corby:  I think there are two ways you do it.  You take it just the wayretailers has managed to make shopping fun in stores while otherretailers have not paid any attention to it and have a totallydifferent market.  You can't make banking fun if it's looking at a PCscreen that has a bunch of account statements and numbers on it.      But if you can create the store electronically and let peoplebrowse, and go to what interests them and learn about you and yourinstitution through the electronic media, I think it's possible. Theother thing is you have to take all the clerical aspects of it away.IVN:Do you think the television is a good medium for electronicbanking.Corby:   I think the issue of TV or PC is irrelevant. Because the factis that      the TVs are becoming more like PCs and the PCs arebecoming more like TVs. What you need to think about is whether you'retalking about a 10-inch interaction or a 10-foot interaction, becausethey are different things that take place in different rooms in thehome.  One involves group activity.  One involves more singleactivity.  You have to think about it that way.     I believe the 10-foot environment is a place where you can bringfinancial services into the home. It's not necessarily where you'regoing to sit down and do detailed financial management.  But that'snot what consumers do every time they think about doing banking. Sometimes they're curious and they want information. They're thinkingabout, "Maybe I want to move to a new house and I wonder what'sinvolved."      If we can get ourselves positioned so that when they start thinkingabout those kind of things, they think to turn to their financialinstitution to learn. Then we're able to sell.IVN:How big of a concern is security on electronic mediums forconsumers?Corby:   I think it's a very big issue for consumers as well as forfinancial institutions.  It's one that we're addressing. But it's ahuge issue and we're going to have to pay attention to it all along.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE VIDEO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996BELL LABS TOUTS VIDEO DEVICE    Bell Laboratories says a 1969 invention, the charge-coupled device,now used worldwide in solid-state video cameras, has become part ofthe first panoramic viewer to provide a 360-degree live-action viewfrom a single vantage point.

Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERACTIVE VIDEO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996TELECOM BILL DELAY STALLS INTERACTIVE INDUSTRYResolution of issues not likely until February     Affordable technology and economies of scale have been the greatinhibitors to credible deployments of consumer interactiveapplications.  Most industry observers point to the lack of investorcertainty in the legislative and regulatory climate as primaryculprits to the industry's stalled development.     "The industry is waiting for Congress to provide the new rulesnecessary in this new era of convergence," concedes Senate CommerceCommittee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-SD), the senator commissionedwith reforming the Communications Act of 1934 in the image of theRepublican Revolution. "And that is what we are trying to accomplish."      Yet it appears that Congressional meddling has provided evenmore uncertainty because of its inability to reach agreement among thetwo chambers, with the communications industry, and with the WhiteHouse about how to pass a telecommunications regulation reform bill.      The situation has been further exacerbated by the budgetimpasse, which not only is preoccupying Congress and the White Housefrom completing legislation, but also is steadily deteriorating analready contentious relationship between Congress and the White House.       That contentious relationship between the legislative andexecutive branches has resulted in constant changes to the billthroughout the process as Republicans attempt to exert theirderegulatory vision of communications policy against constant vetothreats by the president.        Regulatory attorneys have been taking advantage of the timespent debating on legislation to provide their clients with the onlysource of certainty.  "At least now we know how to manipulate thesystem," jokes a Washington attorney who specializes in challengingcable regulation.           The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) likewise has feltthe impact of the telecom legislation debacle, tentatively basingregulatory decisions on the interpretation of legislative tea leaves,yet unwilling to commit itself for fear of alienating a Congress thathas threatened its very existence.       Investors, however, want to know that if they invest in newinteractive technologies and new applications, communicationsattorneys representing potential competitors will not cause delay.      "Most technology-driven cable companies and interactiveapplication start-ups are severely undervalued right now," says PhilipGetter, vice president of investment broker Josephthal Lyons & Ross,New York.  "Investors are skittish about committing money to anindustry with an uncertain regulatory future."       The answer, investors and industry players agree, is a quickresolution to Congressional efforts at completing telecommunicationsregulation reform.  "The potential benefits of this bill to theinteractive, multimedia, and entire communications industry is mind-boggling," says House Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman JackFields (R-Texas).         With a completed bill, investors would get their certainty,lawyers will still have work to do during the transition, start-upswill have access to more capital necessary for interactiveapplications, and consumers will receive a litany of choices tocommunication providers, most of which will use interactiveapplication to differentiate their value.       Currently, a conference committee report, dated Dec. 22, 1995,is being circulated around the Hill awaiting signatures fromconference participants to buoy support in preparation for a vote inboth chambers.         In that conference report, the cable industry would be freedfrom pricing regulation three years after the enactment of the bill,unless they face "demonstrable and effective" competition, in whichcase they could expect immediate relief upon FCC approval.    The hold up, however, is on the liberalization of foreign ownershiprestrictions and cyberporn regulation.  Advanced TV spectrum policy --whether to auction it or provide it for free to incumbent broadcastersalso is an issue of substantial contention that drew comment fromMajority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS). The Clinton administration claimsthat the auction of broadcast spectrum could garner $50 billion forthe U.S. Treasury, a "hysterical" estimate, according to Republicanstaffers.         Congress and the White House have until Feb. 20 to resolve theissues, though, as the Senate will not consider any unscheduled votesuntil then.  Although the House has looser rules about votes thissession, the less disciplined bunch has more Republican Revolution-oriented issues to take up while the Senate gets its schedule inorder.        Many observers consider the cable provision, though, the mostimportant for the interactive industry because the cable industry ismost likely to pursue the more complex consumer applications.

A meeting of the ECTelecommunications Ministers agreed upon a GBP160million subsidy and the rights for broadcasters tochoose the most advanced broadcast technologyavailable.  The Council of the EC has now acceptedthe 'Action Plan' produced by the telecommsministers.The UK had consistently objected to the GBP700million subsidy plans raised by community members andthe backing of D2-MAC as the transmission standard onthe grounds that the technology could soon besuperceded by digital HDTV services and that theimposition of a standard was protecting businessesrather than the consumers.Patrick McLoughlin, the newly appointed trade andtechnology minister, said after the meeting on 16June: "European companies can now be at the cuttingedge of this technology and UK providers will be wellplaced to take advantage because of their expertiseand experience."McLoughlin replaced Edward Leigh in an internalgovernment reshuffle. Leigh caused a May meeting ofministers to stop making a critical decision on thefuture of Euro HDTV after he left early to attend thelaunch of Astra 1C."This is an excellent outcome for Europe and UKindustry and consumers.  After three years of hardnegotiation we now have a realistic and forwardlooking action plan for the development of the cominggenerations of TV technology," said McLoughlin.Commissioner Martin Bangemann said that the fundingwould be used to introduce widescreen HDTV televisionprogramme production, transmission and marketing, butit would be available on a co-financing basis.Participating companies will have to find at least 50percent of the total sum required before applying foran EC subsidy.   Community funding will be phased outon a sliding scale as time goes on."Early entrants in both the developed and lessdeveloped markets will qualify for maximum supportbecause they accept the highest risks.  Thoseundertaking HDTV will also receive a special qualitypremium for the same reason," said the EC statement.Back to Headline List CopyrightSAT NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 21, 1993IBM 'FINALLY' ANNOUNCES EURO SATCOMMS SERVICEIBM has finally announced the official existence ofits IN Satconnect service in Europe, much to thechagrin of the other satellite network operators whoare keeping a somewhat discrete silence over thewhole affair, reports Data Broadcasting News, thesister publication to Satnews.After many months of waiting and broken internaldeadlines, IBM executives have allowed news of thenew service to become officially released.  Manysoftware revisions and internal quality assurancecertifications contributed towards the internaldelays.  Many observers who have seen the systembelieve that the IBM-induced delays were worthwhile.The system has been announced in Austria, Belgium,Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,Switzerland and the UK.Data transmission rates of 9.6kbit/s to 2mbit/s canbe attained through the new 'digital pipe'.  The"general availability" date is slated for 30September 1993.  Countries will be free to set theirown dates.Typically IBM expects one bit in two billion (10 tothe power of 10) to be corrupted at the downlink.Error correction significantly reduces thisoccupance.IN SatConnect is designed to be operatedindependently of other telecommunications networks,although it can be linked with the existing IBMInformation Network services like the IBM InformationExchange EDI service to collect data. With thesystem, the information provider will link into IBM'snetwork to transmit data for distribution. Receivesites will use conventional VSAT hardware combinedwith IBM PCs and custom-designed hardware. VSATreceivers as small as 80cm can be used in the centreof the Eutelsat satellite's footprint.Signal security is a key feature of IN SatConnect,and advanced data masking technology has beenincluded to provide integrity for transmitted data.As the system is digitally-based, video, audio anddata can be merged and transmitted securely.Data can be scheduled so that it is broadcast at aset time even though it has been loaded by theinformation provider onto the transmission system inadvance. Real time data throughput will be supportedon the system during 1994 once a second release ofsoftware is made during December 1993.  IBM ispresently attempting to attract "batch broadcasters"who wish to send large files to multiple locationsrather than the continuous small-file feed companies.Real time feeds are considered an important businessarea and they will be approached once a steady streamof customers has been found.The information provider is charged for connection tothe SatConnect service. There is an initial charge ofGBP3,552 and an annual charge of GBP13,331 for thetransfer of 500 megabytes of data.  Further use ischarged according to a tariff.  Receive sites costGBP1,068 initially with a GBP720 annual chargethereafter.  Under the existing IBM discount scheme,existing IN users can achieve discounts up to 40percent of standard tariff guides, bringing the costsdown significantly in the process.Individual per-megabyte charges will be GBP12.40after the initial 500 megabyte threshold has beenpassed.IBM has signed an agreement with Comstream Corp. tomarket and distribute its satellite receiverequipment.  Although IBM is not making the use ofComstream equipment mandatory, thus allowing thepotential use of plug-compatible equipment, Comstreamequipment will be marketed as a "complimentary non-IBM product" and will feature in all promotional andsales literature.The Comstream DBR401 multi-function satellitebroadcast receiver and LNB are provided under themarketing agreement.One feature of the IBM network is that bandwidth canbe changed "over the air" in accordance with users'needs.

It has been tested by McCormac andconfirmed to decode all Videocrypt channels.Quaintly named as "Ho Lee Fook", the piracy work isclaimed to be based within Central Europe.  The hackworks by effectively acting as a super Videocryptsmart card, giving unlimited access to channels."The card is approximately 16 millimetres longer thanthe official Sky card. It is a blue printed circuitwith a single surface mount chip and five connectorpads," said McCormac, explaining that unlike otherhacks, this one does not use a wafer from a usuallegitimate card, but is instead a specially-engineered chip.During a period of testing no "kill" messages weresent to the card, shutting off service to the BSkyBchannels.  McCormac speculates that a filter may havebeen added telling the on-board circuitry to ignorekill or disable messages sent within the Videocryptdatastream.Commercially, the hack may be renamed SVA1000, butlike many things in the hacking marketplace, thingscan change on a daily basis. Commercial piracymarketers will incorporate the HLF hack withinexisting decoders, and a price point of GBP99 hasbeen mentioned in some circles.Due to UK legislation, it would be an offence forSatnews to give details of the marketing source in aUK-published publication.

The 1993 report analysesthe changes that have been made in the Europeanmarketplace over the past year, and forecasts howthey will change over the short to medium term.During 1992 satellite carriers (such as Eutelsat,Inmarsat and PanAmSat) earned ECU835 million fromEuropean operations, with broadcast televisionaccounting for 55 percent of revenues.  Businessservices accounted for 14 percent and telephony for31 percent of revenues.  Eutelsat was the dominantcarrier, closely followed by Intelsat and SES, ownersof the Astra satellite.CIT says that Astra has managed to get the reputationof being a "hot bird" for European televisiondistribution (DTH), much to the dismay of Eutelsat,and SES revenues are likely to be ECU220 million in2002, compared to ECU270 million for Eutelsat.Clearly Eutelsat's perceived dominance will fall withSES' rises.By the close of 1992, CIT estimated that there werearound 6.7 million DTH terminals in Europe, with theUK and Germany responsible for 77 percent of theshare.   Low cable penetration (and take up) andstrong programming markets were cited as drivers forthis demand.In Eastern Europe, CIT believes that there are around800,000 DTH terminals installed, with 44 percent ofthese in Poland.  Consumer weakness in the formerEastern European countries is seen as a barrier forthe introduction of cable television networks orpremium programming.  Instead, viewers are likely totune into free satellite delivered programming,maximising their resources after purchasing asatellite receiver system.Digital compression of signals is also set to posesome benefits to European broadcasters and viewerssays CIT.  "The arrival of digital compression willeventually radically change the structure of thesatellite TV marketplace, although CIT feels thechange will not be as fast as many insist," says thereport.* Satellite Communications in Western Europe, CITResearch, London.

The heartland of Britainis a centre of major development and innovation in thecable business.Twenty-three of the UK's cable franchises are located inthe Midlands. Not all are operating, but the region as awhole is currently at the forefront in terms of cableconstruction with seven major developments each havingmore than 2,500 connections. Coventry Cable, which beganin 1985, is now one of Britain's few completely-builtsystems (another is in Aberdeen, also owned by the DevanhaGroup).The Midlands region comprises three distinct conurbationsor groups of cities. Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, eachwith active cable systems, form the backbone of the EastMidlands; to the West current cable activity centres onthe Birmingham/ Black Country conurbation and Coventry,while development has yet to begin in the Potteries.Annual cable investment in the region is currentlyapproaching GBP100m, with a total capital spend which willeventually reach about GBP750m.Many aspects of the cable business nationwide areconcentrated in the region: from telephony to specialistprogramme services. Nearly a third of the Birminghamsystem's subscribers use cable for their telephones, forinstance, and about half of the cabled homes in onedistrict of the city subscribe to TV Asia at GBP7.95 amonth.The region, although large, in practice has cableoperators who are mostly independent from each other inownership. The only joint effort is the advertising salesco-operative between Midlands Cable and Birmingham Cable.Between them they could command a million homes - the twolargest franchises in the country.The geographical diversity is complemented by a wide rangeof potential subscribers from a notably multi-ethnicaudience. A quarter of the population of Leicester, forinstance, is of Asian origin. Fourteen per cent of peopleliving in Birmingham have Asian backgrounds, rising to 50per cent in the Small Heath area. The next programmingopportunity in Birmingham is for its considerable Irishpopulation, though its 40,000 members are morewidely-spread than those of Asian origin.Satellite receivers have taken their share of thepotential business of course, but Ted Campbell, ManagingDirector of Birmingham Cable Limited, does not see themoutliving the arrival of cable services in an area: once,that is, people have had dishes for a year or more and thepain of paying for them has been blunted by time.Sidney Bernstein was said to have chosen the North-West tostart Granada Television because he thought it was alwaysraining and people would stay indoors to watch television.Ted Campbell says there are not all that manyopportunities for the mass of the scattered Midlandspopulation to find entertainment outside the home as mightbe the case with the London entertainment circuit.Subscribers are also responding well to the offer ofresidential and business telephone lines, coupling a stateof the art network and locally based service with lowertariffs. Birmingham Cable is now installing NorthernTelecom DMS 100 switches costing more than GBP5 million,with a capacity of 73,000 lines. The company already hasalmost 27,000 residential telephone connections, a thirdof 3,000 potential business lines installed and about2,000 telephone-only subscribers.Eighty-three per cent of calls in Birmingham are local.According to Ted Campbell, city-based operators find itmore profitable to use their own local lines instead ofthose of BT or Mercury. In smaller towns, the proportionof local to long-distance calls would be lower, thusdiminishing the benefits of self-drive telephony.The other major franchise holder in the central Midlandsconurbation is based in Dudley. Midlands Cable, currentlycompleting a partnership agreement with CoxCommunications, covers Wolverhampton and the BlackCountry, and by the end of March had passed 63,000 of thepotential 470,000 homes. It had made 11,917 connect ions -a penetration of 19 per cent. Midlands' second franchiseis based on Telford with a potential 55,000 homes, 18,000of them so far passed.In the East Midlands, Gary Davis, Managing Director ofNottingham-based Diamond Cable, thinks the region is socable-active because 'the Midlands has seemed to me veryprogressive: ready to accept change and try new products.'Diamond, owned by Alabama-based businessman Allan JMcDonald, has seven franchises which together representabout 519,000 homes. Six of these are in the EastMidlands. Gary Davis was a communications lawyer in the USwho migrated into cable development. His wife Sandy Davisis Customer Services Manager at Diamond Cable.Telephony is the spearhead of Diamond's marketing. Inmid-April Diamond had 3,000 cable television subscribers,4,400 residential telephone subscribers and 100 businesstelephone subscribers. The company was the first in the UKto have its own telephone exchange. Diamond Cable's 42programme services include two text-based local services,one of which is produced in association with Radio Trent,the local independent station.Martin Beard became General Manager at Coventry CableTelevision in January 1992 - three months after theDevanha Group took over. Coventry were early starters incable, and the franchise area covers about 119,000 homes.The company does not currently offer telephony, butdiscussions are in hand about its development. Coventryoffers 29 channels, including its popular COLT (CoventryLocal Television) channel. This is still expanding itsoutput and plans to put out ten hours a week ofsubstantially local programmes during this summerOn the city's place in the cable market, Martin Beardcomments: 'Coventry is a good prospect for cable. It haslong traditions at the forefront of innovation.' With newcredit control policies in place, Coventry Cable islooking for growth this year and believes it is on a goodfooting to make that happen. It is marketing a positiveimage, an increased level of customer satisfaction andbetter programme product.Alan Chaney became Chief Executive at LeicesterCommunications Ltd in March, when SaskTel took overcontrol, although he had been associated with theLeicester, Loughborough and Shepshed franchises since1988. Although it is a minority share, LeicesterCommunications remains the only UK cable company to havelocal authority investment.Construction was halted about a year after the start ofbuilding, but is now resuming. The company has pushed upits penetration rate in recent months to 27 per cent andAlan Chaney predicts that it could rise to between 30 and40 per cent.It is now launching telephony in Leicester and hopes to beoffering it to some 3,000 homes by autumn. Chaney feelsthat the telecommunications development will greatlyincrease the system's marketing potential.Leicester currently offers 34 channels, although thesystem has potential for 55. Cable 7, Leicester's licensedlocal channel, was launched last summer.   The CommunityChannel Manager, Jenny Ludlam, now has about 100volunteers providing ideas and programme input. Thechannel transmits eight hours of local programming a week,ranging from the care of pets and finding homes for themto religion and reports of Leicester City Councilmeetings.One proud achievement of Derbyshire Cablevision, accordingto General Manager Keith Tonge, is that in 18 months ofbuilding more than 80 miles of cable, the company hadreceived only 12 complaints. 'Derby is one of the bestcable franchises to have. It has the benefits of being aconcentrated area to build in, but the city itself has notsuffered many of the inner urban social problems whichhave been a feature of other cities,' said Keith Tonge.Derby has a text channel giving out local information, butthe company's Community Liaison Officer, Rachel Turner,has also been developing an interesting local project withschools. Six Derby schools - three of which are alreadycabled - are producing videos on environmental issues intheir areas. Derbyshire Cablevision plans to screen acompilation tape when they are complete.The outer edges of the Midlands region also have some ofthe country's most interesting cable developments:Northampton, with a massive 56 per cent of homes connectedfrom those passed, is involved in a transition fromnarrowband to broadband; Milton Keynes, where virtuallyeveryone is connected to one of the oldest of theindustry's networks, is also being upgraded; and Swindon,the first UK cable franchise which, by the end of March,had risen to one of the country's highest ratios of homesconnected at 32.7 per cent.As the man said, you have to speculate to accumulate. Thediversity of the Midlands has attracted many differentaspects of speculation. And accumulation - of bothconnections and services - is now firmly in the categoryof the pipeline rather than the pipe dream.* This article originally appeared in Spectrum, thequarterly magazine of the Independent TelevisionCommission in the United Kingdom.

For in the business magazines' 1995 ad-page race,Forbes won by 731.47 and 1,350.38 "landslides" over Business Week andFortune, respectively.  Since 1991, when BW last beat Forbes, thebiweekly's ad pages have shot up by 977.60 to last year's 4,543.60(+27.38% versus 1991; +9.32% versus 1994).  It is a fine salute to thejust-retired vp-advertising/promotion Steve Nicoll, who worked at themagazine for 31 years (10 fewer than editor Jim Michaels).* House Speaker Newt Gingrich's impact on Washington, D.C., made himTime's 1995 "Man of the Year" (see page 1), and Newt's puss on the De-cember 25 cover provided the difference of the year in Time's 19.10 ad-page margin over Newsweek.  The latter's associate publisher, GregOsberg, is not perturbed, telling min that "exclude the intra-company'affiliated' ad pages [19.60 out of Newsweek's 2,299.10], and we winhands down."  Whatever, the change in the Time managing editor lineup--Walter Isaacson for Jim Gaines--should add further spice to the 1996contest.  And don't yet count out U.S. News & World Report, whichfinished third last year (-5.71%) after being the newsweeklies' champfrom 1992 through 1994.* Although USN&WR was one of only seven out of the 31weeklies/biweeklies to lose ad pages in 1995, the overall momentumfrom 1994 continued.  If the monthlies' performance is a barometer,then this year should start slowly...except for Financial World(-11.96% in 1995), which--believe it or not--expects to set an all-time ad-page record (dating back to 1902) with its January 16"Forecast 500" issue.

But when Gingrich--who is now droppinglike a rock in the polls as rigor mortis sets in on the idled U.S.government--was named this year's designee (December 25, 1995/January1, 1996), some felt the Pontiff, fresh from a whirlwind East Coastvisit, better fit the bill.  Such is life when it comes to choosingTime's annual honoree.  * The 125 entrants in min's sixth annual "Name Time's Man of the Year"contest experienced a few difficulties of their own.  While Gingrichtied with computing pioneer Bill Gates for second place in the mintallies (15 votes apiece, or 11.9%), Yitzhak Rabin (part of Time'squartet of 1993 winners) won going away.  But even though the lateIsraeli prime minister garnered 35 min votes (28%), no deadperson--not even JFK after his 1963 assassination--has ever beenselected since "Man of the Year's" inception in 1923.  Other popularchoices: Internet (13 votes); O.J. Simpson (12); Bill Clinton andColin Powell (five each); and Cal Ripken, Jr., and Balkans leadersIzetbegovic/Milosevic/Tudjman (four each).* As for min's prize-winning prognosticators, ad sales rep Ed Bowentakes the cake--and our $350 first-place check.

He isreferring to this trifecta: (1) the November promotion of Reader'sDigest Association/USA president Tom Kenney to president of RDA'sGlobal Magazine/Corporate Development unit; (2) last month's electionof Kenney as chairman of the Magazine Publishers of America board ofdirectors; and (3) the fact that it makes Kenney serve as Coleman's"boss" for the third time.  When Kenney moved up at RDA, it seeminglyended a direct working relationship with Coleman that dated back tothe early 1980s at Woman's Day, and entered a second phase at RD in1990 (min, November 13, 1995).  But Kenney's MPA election--madenecessary by the resignations of Claeys Bahrenburg and FrancisPandolfi--puts him in charge of the 1996 American Magazine Conference[October 13-16], which is being put together by a team ledby...Coleman.  If he and Kenney work as well with the AMC as they didat RD, it should be an acceptable--and "Digest-ible"--affair.  Con-ference details are to come.       * Coleman and Kenney set a precedent with two executives from thesame company holding key MPA positions, but a more significantprecedent is the election of Essence Communications founder(1970)/publisher/ceo Ed Lewis as MPA secretary (succeeding Kenney). Lewis is the first African-American to serve on the board ofdirectors, and if the ascension proceeds accordingly, he will bechairman in 1998.

Later in January, he will celebrate his "sweet 16" (months, thatis) as Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau president/ceo, and Ostrowtells min that his industry's best of times is now.  He points to theNovember sweeps that showed the combined ABC/CBS/NBC/Fox audience downto 53% (from 59%) in November 1995, and basic cable's best-ever 19.5rating for the week ending December 10.  "The 'sea change' is perman-ent," he says. "Viewers are looking for programs more closely alignedwith their particular tastes and interests, and it is time for [ad]agencies to realize that the broadcast networks are on a perpetualdownslide." * Ostrow, who spent three decades on the agency side (most withFCB/Leber Katz Worldwide Worldwide), concurs with McCann-EricksonWorldwide senior vp Bob Coen's +14% cable-advertising forecast for1996, but disagrees with the $5.3 billion sum.  "Bob used an old $2.31billion figure for 1994 as his base, which was later adjusted by Niel-sen, Competitive Media Reporting, and others to over $3 billion.  Weshould exceed $6 billion this year."  As for overall 1996 advertising,Ostrow predicts a "strong first half, with the second-half outcomepredicated on the presidential candidates [who they are], and howsuccessful new business ventures are.  I'm bifocused."Back to Headline List CopyrightMIN MEDIA INDUSTRY NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996TICKETMASTER GOES "LIVE!" WITH 40 AD PAGES IN MAGAZINE DEBUT.     When the curtain goes up on Live! January 23 (February issue), itwill be more than just another of some 800+ magazine launchesanticipated in 1996.  At least that's what its parent, TicketmasterCorp., hopes.  Under editor Annie Gilbar and publisher Carole Ference(ex-House Beautiful), the company believes it can exploit itsentertainment world contacts and vast database of people who regularlyattend live events to forge its place among entertainment magazines. With $1.6 billion in 1994 sales, the giant ticket "middleman" may beon to something.  In its debut, Live!--the brainchild of Ticketmasterchief Fred Rosen--will run 40 ad pages from the likes of Estee Lauderand Chrysler Corp..  In coming months, Ference and her sales staff (addirector is Hearst alumnus Michael Petruncola) will duke it out withthe likes of Entertainment Weekly, Premiere, Rolling Stone, and US forthe almighty ad dollar.  In her first pitch, Ference tells us, "Weknow who entertainment customers are and what they buy.  And we havemany ways to reach them: the magazine itself, concert promotions,ticket stub backs, customer databases, even the Ticketmaster Web site"(http://ticketmaster.com).

This Monday (January 8), the Vogue publisher can be seen--and maybeheard--on a segment of the ABC-TV soap-opera "The City" that airs at12:30 p.m. (Eastern).  Galotti plays a magazine publisher (who else?)hosting a party attended by "The City" star Morgan Fairchild.  Whetherthis turns into a recurring role will depend on his "Q" rating, which--if the magazine community comprised the entire viewing audience--wouldgo through the roof.  As of now, Galotti is not a nominee for any of theSoap Opera Digest awards, which are scheduled for a Valentine's Daytelecast (during the "heart" of the February sweeps) on NBC-TV at 9 p.m.Back to Headline List CopyrightMIN MEDIA INDUSTRY NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996PIB: 1995 MAGAZINE AD $$$ SHOULD BREAK THE $10 BILLION BARRIER.

The service, which as of yet has not beenofficially named, becomes effective January 18, according tospokesman Bruce Reid. The service targets high-volume directory assistance users (banks,financial services firms and retailers, for instance). Subscribersaccess the service via an identification code and password througheither AT&T's Accunet(R) Packet Service or through the originatingtelco packet switch network. The prices vary according to whichmethod of access subscribers choose. Using Accunet, the price is a$2500-per- month subscription fee, plus a $22-per-hour holding timecharge, and 35 cents per screen. Using the local telco, the pricewould run $500 for the monthly subscription fee, $22 hourly holding,and 40 cents per screen. (This pricing structure is SouthwesternBell's; other telcos may vary.) Mr. Reid pointed out that "a nickeldifference between per- screen charges doesn't seem like much, butwith the volume of accesses expected, these fees will most likelybalance out." He also added, "We are offering a promotion for thosewho order an installation by February 28. We'll waive the monthly feethrough March (subscribers begin paying it in April), plus we'reoffering one free ID and password--a savings of $100." What do subscribers get for their investment? Access to the samescreens directory assistance operators call up in response tocustomer inquiries. When the EDA service starts up in January, theSouthwestern Bell area listings will be available. AT&T isnegotiating with the other RBOCs and hopes to work out agreementswith all of them for complete national access to directory assistancelistings. U S WEST has also agreed to have its directory assistance listingsavailable on the AT&T service, but not until a pending waiver requestis granted and tariff filed. U S WEST's proposed Electronic WhitePages (EWP) service was originally formulated when AT&T approached US WEST about the plans for this electronic directory assistanceproduct. U S WEST opted to build and maintain the databasethemselves, making AT&T a non-exclusive distributor of theinformation. As stated in the December, 1989 issue of The MorganReport, U S WEST has plans for other vendors to offer the database,although AT&T is the only one in place at this time. Several sourcesintimated that NYNEX would also be entering into an agreement withAT&T, but this was not confirmed as of press time. TMR wonders what impact an electronic (computer-access) directoryassistance service will have on the white pages CD-ROM products onthe market. A number of niche markets for the CD-ROM products wouldnot be touched, such as smaller companies with local and regionalmarkets, and those using the CD-ROM white pages for  specializedsearching. But the big-dollar markets, including banks and retailerswith large volume look-up requirements, and for whom up-to- the-minute accuracy is important, are likely purchasers of this service. Several RBOC's and private firms currently offer white page listingson CD-ROM. None has national coverage. All of these companies haveacknowledged intense customer interest in obtaining nationalcoverage. TMR sees the potential for this new national electronicdirectory assistance service to take business away from the CD-ROMproducts. However, since the CD-ROM products offer more developedsearching features, they will probably remain competitive in certainniche markets, attracting users in areas such as law enforcement,market research and bill collection. These white page databases,among the largest in the world, have been sought after by a number ofpublishers.  Some have sought to link all seven RBOC's in somefashion, but none has been successful at it. If AT&T pulls all theRBOC's together to create what is effectively a gateway into theseseven physically separate databases, it will be a first. TMR expectsmounting activity in this area as the complex legal issuessurrounding ownership of this information continue to be explored.Ownership and access to this information is of major interest to allthose professionally involved in building information products. Editor's Note: At press time, it was reported that AT&T has alsoreached agreement with CompuServe to offer its 800 number database on- line to CompuServe's over 500,000 subscribers free of connect timecharges. An AT&T spokesperson preferred to characterize thearrangement as a "unique form of directory assistance" and not aforay into electronic publishing. TMR will continue to watch withinterest as AT&T continues its slow but seemingly inevitable movementtoward becoming a major player in electronic and possibly printpublishing.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORGAN REPORT ON DIRECTORY PUBLISHING via NewsNetJanuary, 1990AMERICAN BUSINESS INFORMATION'S BUSINESS INFOLINEAmerican Business Information, Inc. (Omaha, NE) has begun a 900-number directory assistance service based on its business informationdatabase. Called "Business Infoline," the service provides live operator-assisted access to ABI's database of U.S. yellow page listinginformation. Operators can conduct searches by category (type ofcompany), company name, partial name, or area code and phone number.Geographical searches can be done on the basis of city, three- orfive- digit ZIP code, state, or nationwide. In addition to names,addresses and phone numbers, operators can give users additionalinformation on a company based on its yellow page advertisingprofile. For instance, one caller wanted to know if a particularflorist also carried balloons. Based on the company's advertising,the operator was able to determine that yes, the florist did in factsell balloons. According to Bill Chasse, vice president of online products withABI, the most frequent calls so far have been requests for phonenumbers when the whereabouts of a company is unknown. "About half ofthe calls from our business clients are consumer-oriented. Forinstance, one man had his windshield broken. He called us to find thenearest windshield repair shop, after he looked in the yellow pagesand found there weren't any suitable shops in the local area itcovered." Usage of the service has reportedly been very good. "When we firstlaunched the service, we estimated calls would last an average of 3minutes. We have found that calls are actually averaging 6-8minutes," Mr. Chasse said. "When the first request gets a hit, thecaller gets excited and can generally think of a number of other look-up requests." The cost is $2 for the first minute and $1 for each additionalminute. Mr. Chasse explained that it doesn't take callers long tofigure out the economics: "They know if they have their look-upsready to go, our operators can do quite a few searches in that one ortwo minutes." Business Infoline is intended both for business customers andconsumers. Marketing has been conducted via press releases on aregular basis to a database of 5,000 media personnel and spaceadvertising in a number of business-oriented publications (such as the Wall Street Journal, and TheWashingtonian). "We have primarily been marketing to our existingcustomers by including flyers and information sheets in every orderand mailing we send them. Starting the first of the year, we will bedoing a little direct mail, sending out a plastic card people cankeep in a wallet; we realize how important it is that people rememberthe number," explained Mr. Chasse. "We will also be stepping up ourconsumer-oriented advertising, with TV and space advertising gearedtoward them. We see the Infoline as a 60% consumer, 40% businessservice." The Morgan Report has been watching 900 numbers as a potentiallyexcellent way to distribute directory information and charge for iteasily. But success in 900 numbers is a pure dollars equation. Thequestion is, can you afford enough promotion to build adequate callvolume? A company can have the slickest service in the world, but itcannot prosper if people don't know about it. TMR expects to see a lot more directory publishers looking into 900numbers. The ability to offer live operators assistance on 900 linesis a fairly recent development, and should make 900 that much moreattractive to many directory publishers. Interested TMR subscribers may call the "Business Infoline" at900/896-6000. Editor's Note: As TMR expected, American Business Information, Inc.will be launching a new CD-ROM product based on its nationwidedatabase of approximately 8.3 million companies. The information isnot current, published about 4-5 months after the publication of theyellow page directories from which it is culled, but searching willbe sophisticated. TMR will be watching this product closely. It isHEAD = ORACLE FORMSPUBLISHING SUBSIDIARY Oracle Corporation (Belmont, CA), reportedly the world's largestsupplier of database software and the third largest software andservices company, has announced the formation of a new publishingsubsidiary. The new company is called Oracle Data Publishing (ODP). ODP's charter is to provide its customers access to a variety ofcomputer-based information services which can assist them in makingcritical business decisions. It will acquire and sell, in electronicformat, a broad range of data and information which many Oraclecustomers already use in print form. Dick Brass, a pioneer in thefield of electronic publishing, has been named president of the newsubsidiary. "Oracle Data Publishing is a natural extension of our provenexpertise in database software and services," said Larry Ellison,Oracle's president and CEO. "With ODP, we will give customers theinformation they need in addition to the software required to accessand manipulate that information." According to Mr. Brass, the growing transition from printed toelectronic information distribution, coupled with the proliferationof database management software, makes Oracle a logical entrant intothe data publishing arena. Prior to joining Oracle, Dick Brass was founder of GeneralInformation (Kirkland WA), which publishes The National Directory ofAddresses and Telephone Numbers, and other products in both print andelectronic formats. Before General Information, Mr. Brass acquiredthe exclusive electronic rights to a number of important referenceworks, including The Random House Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, andBlack's Law Dictionary. This development is an important one to watch. Oracle is well-knownfor its aggressiveness in its markets, one of which is now in thedirectory realm. No specifics were available on products planned, butrollout of its first products are expected within the year.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORGAN REPORT ON DIRECTORY PUBLISHING via NewsNetJanuary, 1990U S WEST ON SPECIALTY DIRECTORY PUBLISHINGU S WEST is the only Regional Bell to refrain from publishingdirectories outside the traditional yellow page arena. The MorganReport recently spoke to Philip Unger, director of marketing with U SWEST Direct, about the company's point of view on specialty directorypublishing, which should be of interest to all directory publishers. "We did analyze the possible needs for specialty directoryproducts," Mr. Unger said. "Our first conclusion was to concentrateon our 14- state area. Otherwise, outside our region,  we felt we'dstart with two strikes against us" in an unfamiliar publishingventure in an unfamiliar market. "We also scoped out the size of the breadbox, and saw that there isa lot less money (in specialty publishing) than we're used to in thetraditional yellow page arena. We saw that the margins would be muchlower--with increased costs for distribution, sales, databases--particularly the distribution database, where we'd be starting fromscratch. The sales cost would be much higher per dollar of revenue,so we saw publishing specialty directories would be smaller inrevenues and in profit. "After we had looked at size, we looked at need. We didn't want tojust throw something out there--it would have to meet a real need.And there would have to be a high quality editorial effort as well,to create strong editorial content--not just a 95% advertising product. We made a list of the top 20specialty directories that would fit into our region. We prioritizedthem, and did a business case on two of them. We found that wecouldn't both meet the need and make a profit. We could do a greatjob but lose money, or we could cut corners and make money--and haveit fail the second or third year. We didn't like either of thoseoptions." Mr. Unger said that U S WEST Direct continues to look at specialtypublishing, but doesn't want to go into it for the PR value alone."We are in business to meet needs and keep shareholders happy." It should be a reassuring note to non-yellow page directorypublishers that despite virtually unlimited resources, the RBOCpublishing organizations have such a high cost of doing business thatthere are few directory opportunities they can justify pursuing. Thethinking is becoming increasing common among the RBOC's, that few, ifany, start- up directory opportunities are worth the risk.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORGAN REPORT ON DIRECTORY PUBLISHING via NewsNetJanuary, 1990AMERICAN EXPORT REGISTER DISCOUNT OFFERAn unusual renewal program instituted by Thomas InternationalPublishing Company (New York, NY) for its American Export Registerrecently came to The Morgan Report's attention. "This program, theQualified Lifetime Subscriber Program, allows all overseas buyers whopurchase their first set at the full retail price ($120) an 85%credit toward all future consecutive editions they purchase,"explained circulation director Ms. Renate Oechsner. The program was first offered to purchasers of the '87-88 editionwhen it came time for them to purchase the '88-89 edition of theRegister. Ms. Oechsner said that the response to the offer "has beenvery nice. People are even paying by credit card, because the priceis low; it used to be such a hassle for them to get a check in U.S.funds and send it." The reason given for the program, which reduces renewal subscriptionrates to shipping costs ($18 surface, $39 air mail), is an effort tobuild circulation. "It does our advertisers no good if people buy oneyear and not for the next four." As many publishers have suffered, sothe Register has suffered the whims of those who go several yearsbefore updating to a new edition of the directory. Because theAmerican Export Register is primarily advertising-based, fluctuatingsales are particularly exasperating. "With increased circulation, ouradvertisers will be happy, and more will want to get into theRegister--the two things go hand in hand, and hopefully will getbetter and better," Ms. Oechsner added. According to Ms. Oechsner, the directory is "not quite controlledcirculation (with this program), but we do qualify (subscribers) witha questionnaire. It helps give us develop information we can thengive to advertisers, such as where subscribers buy materials and howmany companies they have contacted through the directory." The American Export Register is an annual guide to U.S. products andservices available for export. It targets "businessmen,industrialists, and government buyers worldwide." The directory iscomprised of a two-volume set. This move by Thomas is interesting because it creates a whole newrelationship with subscribers. It asks them to pay for a directorythe first time around, proving their interest and setting the valueof the directory. From then on, only a small annual maintenance fee(enough to cover shipping) is required to continue receiving futureeditions. This pricing strategy allows Thomas to offer advertisers apaid subscriber base, and the nominal price allows Thomas to offsetsome of its costs--important with the cost of shipping a two-volumedirectory overseas. The final benefit to Thomas is that the nominalinvoice it renders each year is a continued check on subscriberinterest and helps keep the circulation file clean and current.Overall, this strategy may be worth looking into, even for somedomestic buying guides.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORGAN REPORT ON DIRECTORY PUBLISHING via NewsNetJanuary, 1990NEW PRESIDENT FOR PACIFIC BELL DIRECTORYJohn Gaulding has submitted his resignation as president of PacificBell Directory (San Francisco, CA), effective at the end of January.Mr. Gaulding will be returning to his consulting business, in whichhe was involved before assuming the presidency with PBD. His businesswill include management counseling and investor services to theinformation industry. Beginning February 1, Dick Van Allen will be taking over aspresident of PBD.

His directory experience includeshaving served as general manager for Pacific Northwest Bell'sdirectory department.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORGAN REPORT ON DIRECTORY PUBLISHING via NewsNetJanuary, 1990MARKET OVERVIEW: ADOPTION DIRECTORIESThe Morgan Report has noticed a rise in activity in the field ofadoption information. A variety of first-edition directories coveringthis information have appeared in the last 12 months or so, buildingon the hodge-podge of directories and directory sections of otherpublications already published. Here's the run-down: The Adoption Directory (Gale Research, Inc.). Billed as "a guide toagencies, state laws on adoption, exchanges, support groups, andprofessional service in domestic and international adoption,including foster parenting and biological options." The directory isarranged alphabetically within subject-oriented chapters, and issupported by keyword, agency name and geographical indexes.Approximately 1,500 listings are included. A typical agency listingcovers information on application procedures, prerequisites, fees,length of waiting time for a child, and a description of the childrenplaced. It sells for $55. CWLA's Guide to Adoption Agencies: A National Directory of AdoptionAgencies and Adoption Resources (Child Welfare League of America).Editor: Julia L. Posner (with James Guilianelli, contributingeditor). This directory appears to be in direct competition with theGale directory. This directory has going for it the prestige of beingassociated with the Child Welfare League--no small benefit. Thedirectory sells for $15.95. Adoption: The Guide to Successful Adoptions (Ulick PublishingCompany). Another newcomer to the field, but in a magazine format.Julia Posner contributed the section on traditional agency adoption;she is, as noted above, the editor of CWLA's Guide. The magazinetargets adoptive or prospective adoptive parents, and others seekingto wade through the adoption mire. The National Adoption Directory,comprises half the magazine's pages and lists "adoption facilitators"state-by-state, within categories (agencies, case workers,foundations, lawyers, support groups, etc.). The directory onlyincludes those who returned questionnaires. The reason given for thisis the desire only to present those "who want to help with youradoption." A number of adoption facilitators have their hands fulland chose not to list. Listings include name, contact name, address,phone, local or national operation, and number of years in operation.A banner at the end of the directory section states that morelistings will appear in the next issue of Adoption magazine. Thecover price for the magazine is $5 an issue, $30 per year(bimonthly). Revenues are generated by subscription; no advertisingis included. Adoption: Parenthood Without Pregnancy (Henry Holt and Company). Thedirectory content is secondary, with an appendix listing agencies andsupport groups. The last edition published was 1986, which sold for$18.45. Adoption Resource Book (Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.). Thedirectory section is secondary and covers public and private adoptionagencies and support groups. Listings include agency name, address,phone, and special requirements. The latest edition was published inNovember, 1987 and sold for $17.95 (hardbound); $8.85 (softbound). Our Child: Preparing for Parenting in Adoption--Instructor's Guide(Our Child Press). This directory lists as part of its appendixesaudiovisual aids, resources, books, and periodicals available tothose teaching courses on adoptive parenting. The last issue waspublished in 1988, with another due out perhaps in 1990. The primarycontent of the publication is a curriculum guide for instructors ofnew parents. SourceList (Committee for Single Adoptive Parents). This is anannual directory of about 50 agencies and organizations that aresources of adopted children accepting unmarried applicants. It hasinternational coverage. The listings are geographically arranged andsell for $15 including three updates, but the directory is sold onlyto unmarried members of the organization. Discussion: The activity in this market appears to be an example ofsocial tide driving the need for (and the provision of) information.It is unusual for several directories with virtually the same contentand scope to appear at the same time, as is the case with the CWLAand Gale directories. Gale has a strong hold on the library market,and the CWLA directory has substantial prestige behind it. How wellthese directories fare will depend in large part on how well theyreach their target markets. Other opportunities in this field seem tolie in areas touched but not yet fully developed. For example,SourceList covers an important and needed body of information, but isseriously undermarketed, and has the potential for greaterinformation development. TMR expects more titles in this fieldbecause the need for information continues to grow, and new userconstituencies are likely to emerge, bringing with them a need formore timely and detailed information in this field.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORGAN REPORT ON DIRECTORY PUBLISHING via NewsNetJanuary, 1990TMR NEWSNOTESDATABASE OF NURSING HOMES: F1RSTMARK has announced the release of itslatest "Personal Computer Database" product, the Oryx Nursing HomeDatabase derived from the Directory of Nursing Homes published by TheOryx Press (Phoenix, AZ).

The menu of options includes simple tutorialsabout financial topics such as the stock market. For #2.50, paid bycredit card, users can obtain investment opinions on any of 100 FTSEand a further 25 popular stocks from a printer built into the system.It also offers a real-time account of City news via a MarketEye screen.Unlike the touchscreen PC-based sharedealing service which NationalWestminster Bank has operated in its high street network since 1986,BarclayZone includes a videoconferencing link to an adviser at BarclaysStockbrokers' head office in Glasgow. This is used for buying andselling shares, with dealing costs starting at #15, the same as dealingby telephone.The same video technology could allow Barclays, subject to customeracceptance, to offer a broad range of financial services such asinsurance, tax services and mortgage advice through computer screens inbank branches or kiosks in public places. Last year, it set upBarclaySquare, an Internet-based electronic shopping mall, as well asan interactive information service for its customers on the Internet.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996SILICON GRAPHICS EXPERIENCES REVENUE SLOWDOWNSilicon Graphics, the US graphics workstation vendor, warned thatearnings per share for its second quarter to 31 December 1995 would bearound 30 cents, down from 34 cents a year earlier. It also saidrevenues would rise by only 23% to $675m from $550m in the same quarterof 1994.Analysts had predicted 43 cents a share and a 40-45% increase inrevenues for Silicon Graphics' second quarter. Following the profitwarning, which led to an immediate 16% drop in Silicon Graphics' shareprice, analysts cut their earnings estimates for the financial year to30 June 1996 by 15-20%.Chairman Edward McCracken said revenue growth in Europe and NorthAmerica had not met the company's expectations, due to a slowdown insales to the US government as a result of federal budget uncertaintiesand also to economic slowdowns in the UK, France and Germany. Sales viathird party channels were below expectations, he added. Revenues werealso affected by customers who decided to wait for a new range of high-performance Silicon Graphics computers due to be launched this monthbased on the new R1000 microprocessor.Silicon Graphics has been experiencing annual revenue growth of 45-50%over the last few years, more than double the growth rate for theentire workstation market. Capitalising on demand for graphicalworkstations in fast-growing markets such as video editing, Web sitedesign and computer game development, Silicon Graphics is now numberthree behind Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard.Analysts said that although Silicon Graphics faces a threat fromaggressive price cuts by Sun Microsystems and the new breed of high-specification multimedia PCs, it does not face any long-term problems.Its 23% second quarter growth rate is above the industry average, forexample, and its new Indigo2 Impact workstation, launched in the secondquarter, has received an "outstanding" response from customers.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996EPIC RECEIVES 3I CASH INJECTIONBrighton-based Epic Multimedia Group has received #1m in funding fromventure capitalists 3i.EMG, which was set up in 1985 as a multimedia production companyworking for corporate clients such as the BBC, National WestminsterBank and BT, will use the funding to expand its consumer game andeducational CD-ROM publishing activities. "We are looking to developour own content with reduced involvement from large publishing co-funders", says managing director Jim Brathwaite.EMG is also preparing for a flotation sometime next year, says newly-appointed finance director Andrew Duncan. However, Mr Duncan stressesthat the timing and access route for a public offering have yet to bedetermined. The options under review include joining London's newAlternative Investment Market for smaller stocks or a full listing onthe Stock Exchange. New York's Nasdaq is also a possibility, given theimportance of the US market to EMG, Mr Duncan says.EMG, which in November 1995 completed a #1m private placing ofconvertible loanstock with Henry Cooke Lumsden, has quadrupled in sizeover the last two years and now has a staff of around 150. In May 1994it raised #1.5m from UK venture capitalists Quester and from Dutch-based Atlas Venture.In an interview published in the Financial Times management reportFinancing Multimedia in Europe by Janet Robson, Gerard Montanus ofAtlas Venture said that Atlas sees multimedia as a specific nichemarket within IT. Multimedia companies such as EMG are currentlyregarded and valued more like IT businesses than as publishingbusinesses, Mr Montanus suggested. Atlas typically invests in companiesfor four to six years, normally structuring its deals as equity andsubsequently putting in follow-on capital.Publishing partnershipsEMG's publishing division has four separate units - Learning,Entertainment, Medical & Healthcare, and Lifestyle. It develops CD-ROMand CD-i titles in association with major international companies, butretains significant intellectual property rights. Its $3.6m three-yeardevelopment funding and publishing deal with Time Warner Interactiveprovides EMG with marketing and distribution channels for releases suchas Thumbelina, a children's title based on an animated Warner Brosfeature film by Don Bluth of the Hans Andersen story.EMG Publishing is involved in three multimedia development operations -the Spice Factory joint venture with film producers Jason Piette andMichael Cowen specialising in fantasy/adventure games as well as filmsand TV programmes; Eagle Peak, a collaboration with independentproducer New Media Vision specialising in interactive comic books andencyclopaedias; and children's and educational publisher Labyrinth.EMG provides all the funding for each of these companies but gives theindividual developers an equity stake in their own venture in additionto considerable creative independence.Eagle Peak is developing the Takeru series of CD-ROM titles based onthe highly-popular Japanese-language comic books of the same name.Labyrinth is working on a number of CD-ROM titles funded by Time WarnerInteractive such as the multimillion pound project Drowned God(previously given the code name Iron Horse), tipped as TWI's lead forits Christmas 1996 release schedule.The Spice Factory is developing a CD-ROM game jointly funded by EMGPublishing and film company Pachyderm (a subsidiary of Goldcrest Films)based on the science fiction film Space Truckers. The game is being pre-sold country by country with the film. Spice Factory is also due torelease its first feature film, The Killer Tongue, this year.Although 50-60% of EMG's business comes from its long-establishedcorporate communications work, it sees most of its future growth comingfrom consumer multimedia publishing. In addition, EMG has set up a teamto design user interfaces for interactive TV networks such as BT's EastAnglian trial for which EMG also produced National Westminster Bank'sinteractive banking interface.Another significant growth area for EMG is likely to be the Internet.Just before Christmas, Scotland Online, a joint venture betweenScottish Telecom and cartoon publisher D.C. Thompson, went live withWeb pages designed by EMG Interactive, EMG's corporate communicationsdivision. In addition to the corporate Web site market, EMG sees greatpotential for its intellectual properties in consumer Internetpublishing and games-on-demand.1996 is likely to be an exciting year for EMG's CD-ROM publishingdivision, with the launch of the first fruits of its three publishingjoint ventures. In addition, several major new titles are expected byDecember which will eventually be available over the Internet, says JimBrathwaite. He also promises a deal with an unspecified UK partner toproduce a CD-ROM and hard copy tie-in.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996INNER WORKINGS INTERIM SALES AHEADInner Workings plc, the Glasgow-based CD-ROM developer, reported salesof #186,911 for the six months to 30 September 1995, compared to#24,142 a year earlier.The loss on ordinary activities widened to #115,736 from #65,983 lasttime, reflecting the company's investment in production facilities andstaff outlined in its prospectus at  its Alternative Investment Marketflotation last August. Inner Workings raised #1m net of costs to fundexpansion through its share placing.Alistair King of London stockbrokers Charles Stanley predicts thatInner Workings will become profitable in 1997 and suggests that itmight be acquired by a larger concern interested in its skilled staff.Last year the company completed the first two titles in a range of fourchildren's CD-ROMs for Oxford University Press, The Fish Who Could Wishand A Christmas Story. Eight foreign language versions of these titlesare under active negotiation, with the first of these due for deliveryto the European market by spring 1996. The remaining two OUP children'stitles, Winnie the Witch and Dragons, will be launched in May.Chairman Lesley Keen says Inner Workings has established thefoundations of an advanced software engineering facility which isintended to be used to produce the company's own educational and gamessoftware. The first "own brand" title is planned to go into productionin late spring 1996.The first product in a three-title CD-ROM deal with Reed Consumer Booksis expected to be released for the Christmas 1997 market, says Ms Keen.Inner Workings is close to signing a co-production deal with a majorglobal publisher on a children's activity game title for the Christmas1996 market, and is entering the prototype development phase on a CD-ROM title for Philips Media for the US market.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996MACROMEDIA ACQUIRES OSCMacromedia has acquired OSC Inc, a San Francisco-based developer ofdigital audio production software including Deck II, the award-winningmulti-track music and sound production program.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996APPLE, REPRISE RECORDS IN NEW MEDIA PARTNERSHIPApple Computer is to work together with Warner Music label RepriseRecords to promote Reprise artists in tandem with Apple new mediatechnology and software.

In the six months to June 1995, PolyGram, which has achieved a20% compound annual growth rate in net income since 1990, saw profitsrise 15%.In 1994 PolyGram recorded pre-tax profits of Fl 1.08bn (#436m) on salesof Fl 8.6bn. Chairman Alain Levy said the group would return to profitgrowth this year, due to an improved album release schedule includingnew work from artists such as Sting, U2 and the Cranberries. He blamed1995's poor performance on a below-par release schedule in the secondhalf, delays in the delivery of big albums, the lack of a major filmhit and the strength of the guilder.In a bid to expand its four-year-old film business, PolyGram agreedlast month to buy the film and TV library of The Samuel GoldwynCompany, the financially troubled US film group, for $62m (#39m) incash. Goldwyn, which has been seeking capital to reduce its debts, soldthe rights to 850 feature films including recent productions such asThe Madness of King George and Much Ado About Nothing as well asseveral TV series.The deal follows PolyGram's $156m purchase last January of Los Angeles-based ITC Entertainment which owns the rights to 350 feature films andvintage TV series in addition to running a programming distributionbusiness. Last year PolyGram entered the video CD market with a batchof releases including its 1994 movie hit Four Weddings and a Funeraland titles from rock bands such as Wet Wet Wet, Abba and The Who.For Alain Levy, the key word is "leverage" - squeezing more revenuefrom PolyGram's copyright material by leveraging it across multipledistribution channels. This explains PolyGram's interest inestablishing more TV channels along the lines of its music videochannel collaboration with Viacom subsidiary MTV, a customer for muchof its music. It hopes to sell Goldwyn's film back catalogue as apackage to cable and TV channels with new films from its PolyGramFilmed Entertainment unit.However, although Mr Levy has abandoned his initial scepticism aboutthe information highway and his company is actively setting uppromotional Web sites, he believes that electronic distribution ofmusic via the Internet will never replace physical retailing. "Buyingmusic is a social experience, and the packaging of a product is veryimportant", he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996ELECTRONIC SHOPPINGAccording to a report by retail property consultants Healey & Baker,Where People Shop, by 1997, 5% of all retail spending in England,Scotland and Wales will be done over the Internet, amounting to over#7.5bn of business.

The reportscovers all categories of CD-ROM titles.Worldwide CD-ROM title revenue rose by only 70% to $18.1bn from$10.7bn, due to the rapid expansion of the consumer sector where steepdiscounting prevails because of intense competition for shelfspace andwidespread bundling.In 1994, just over 20% of total worldwide CD-ROM revenues were derivedfrom consumer sales, with the remainder coming from the professional,corporate and educational markets. The number of consumer CD-ROM titlesin print doubled to over 3,000 in 1994 and is expected to have doubledagain in 1995.InfoTech predicts that in 1995 the consumer sector grew to 24% of thetotal CD-ROM market. Led by strong sales of multimedia home PCs, theworldwide installed base of CD-ROM drives for both PCs (all platforms)and TV set-top systems such as CD-i, Sega and 3DO grew to 26.9m in1994, and is forecast to rise by over 80% to 49.5m in 1995.In 1995, for the first time, more CD-ROM drives were sold in new PCsthan in multimedia upgrade kits, by a margin of more than 2 to 1.Preliminary research for 1995 suggests that around 35% of notebookssold worldwide were CD-ROM equipped, InfoTech says.

Apple has traditionally enjoyedbig sales in the run-up to Christmas and in the quarter to December1994 posted net profits of $188m.Apple said that an aggressive price-cutting campaign begun in Augusthad failed to stimulate expected demand for its Macintosh computers inits key markets of Japan and the US, leaving it with unsold inventory.Analysts now expect Apple to drastically streamline its operationsthrough up to 2,000 job losses and speculate that it will seek a mergerpartner or put itself up for sale. Speculation centres on IBM, Sony orOracle as the most likely buyers. Oracle is believed to have made anoffer for Apple's Newton personal digital assistant unit to support itsown mobile computing ambitions.In the quarter to 30 September 1995 Apple regained lost market shareand its position as the largest PC manufacturer in the US market.However, this was due mainly to existing Apple users upgrading theirsystems.

In the quarter to December 1994, Cirrus earned $14.5m net, or46 cents a share.Following a sharp drop in its share price in response to the profitwarning, Cirrus said it would delay a planned offering of 6m commonshares and $500m in convertible subordinated notes. It also said itwould reduce fiscal 1997 and 1998 capital expenditure by over $600m,although it still intends to expand its manufacturing capacity during1997-1999.Cirrus has expanded over the last few years due to the growth in demandfor multimedia PCs. In the year to April 1995 it posted net profits of$61.4m on sales of $889m, compared to net profits of $45.4m on sales of$557.3m in 1994.The company said results in the quarter to December had suffered fromsofter than anticipated conditions in Taiwan and slower than expectedgrowth in the home PC market. Sales for the quarter ending March 1996would depend on the success of several new graphics and audio products,it added.In November 1995, Cirrus warned that third quarter revenue growth wouldbe hit by reductions in orders for its multimedia chips from a majorcustomer, believed to be Intel. Analysts said Intel had cut its ordersbecause US computer manufacturer Packard Bell had stocked too many PCmotherboards containing a 32-bit Cirrus chip and had lost sales to 64-bit versions from rival vendors such as Compaq. Packard Bell has alsosuffered from overstocking of 75MHz Pentium-based PCs at a time whenconsumers are opting for faster, competitively-priced PCs from othervendors.Tom Rigoli, vice president of corporate communications at Cirrus, saidthat several customers are now seeking to have their advance chiporders fulfilled sooner, suggesting a potential recovery in home PCsales. Nevertheless, several key US analysts lowered their estimates ofCirrus' earnings in fiscal 1997. Drew Peck of Cowen & Co, for example,cut his forecast from $2.72 a share to $2.22.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996AMSTRAD CUTS BACK CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ARMAmstrad has announced a restructuring of its lossmaking Ace divisionwhich produces a range of audio, video and satellite TV equipment forthe fiercely competitive consumer electronics market.The decision to scale back Ace - once the core of Amstrad's empire -and concentrate on Amstrad's higher-margin activities in direct PCsales, modems and mobile telephones led to the resignation last monthof chief executive David Rogers, half way through a three-yearcontract.According to the Financial Times, an internal strategy paper waspresented to Amstrad's board last month warning that Ace could not berevitalised and would not break even in the year to June 1996.

A consensus on the main terms of the deregulation billhad already been reached in November (Multimedia Business Analyst,2/4/4).This latest deal is important in ensuring that the legislation passesboth houses of parliament - the lower house (Bundestag) controlled bythe governing Christian Democrat/Free Democrat coalition and the upperhouse (Bundesrat) controlled by the Social Democrats. It will go beforethe Bonn cabinet on 24 January and parliamentary debate will begin nextmonth. With all-party consent, the new telecom bill is expected tobecome law this summer.This month, the Finance Ministry will hold a meeting to finally resolvethe political deadlock over the role of the telecom industry regulatorwhich will need to be set up prior to deregulation. It is thoughtlikely that the Finance Ministry will be responsible for thegovernment's stake in Deutsche Telekom after its partial privatisationin late 1996 through a DM15bn share issue.The bill will open up the DM75bn German telecom market, the thirdlargest in the world after the US and Japan, from 1998, whilepreventing companies from abusing dominant positions. It will also pavethe way for an influx of investment by international telecom operatorssuch as BT, AT&T and Cable & Wireless, building on alliances they havealready formed with German companies.The content of the bill will be largely as agreed by the politicalparties in November. As well as paving the way for large operators tooffer nationwide services, the bill foresees a role for smaller andmedium-sized companies providing services. It will allow frequencies tobe made available locally to promote more competition through wirelesslinks.The bill will also include an obligation on the government to ensurethe universal provision of affordable, high-standard telephone servicesto all users.

BroadBand's FLX (FibreLoopAccess) SDV System transmits bi-directional interactive multimedia overfibre-to-the-curb networks to groups of 20-30 houses via an OpticalNetwork Unit (ONU). Because of its use of 16-CAP, FLX can carryanalogue cable TV signals as well as interactive services into the homeover the same coax wire using a diplexer.16-CAP allows the re-use of existing Category 3 unshielded twisted pair(UTP) copper wiring, the standard for kerbside-to-home installation,for digital ATM and telephony traffic. It eliminates the need for thecomplex modulation schemes, adaptive equalisation, high-frequencyanalogue tuning and forward error correction required by competingencoding/modulation technologies, Mr Nasta says.The MBA chips are already being implemented as part of planneddeployments of BroadBand's FLX SDV System by France Telecom and of AT&TNetwork Systems' SLC-2000 Access with FLX SDV System by SouthwesternBell and Disney's Celebration Community, a test-bed for interactivecommunications being built in Orlando, Florida.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996TELECOM COMPETITION SPURS MULTIMEDIA GROWTHThe liberalisation of voice telecommunications across the EuropeanUnion from 1998 will lead to the growth of new services, includingmultimedia, as operators look for new sources of income, says a reportfrom Cambridge-based Analysys Publications.Existing telecom players - cable TV companies, managed network serviceproviders and telecom operators (TOs) - are all looking to secureadvantage. New players such as rail and power companies, entrantsbacked by industrial consortia and start-ups based on advancedtechnologies are already breaking into the lucrative ECU129bn telecommarket which is growing at a rate of 7% per annum, says Paul Knott,author of New Network Operators in Europe.Many of the new entrants look set to pursue niche market strategies,targeting their price and new services at particular groups ofcustomers, in contrast with the broader marketing strategies pursued bythe incumbents, says Mr Knott. As they are not hampered by legacyinfrastructure, new entrants are busy investing in modern networktechnologies such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and SDH(Synchronous Digital Hierarchy). SDH is a prerequisite for ATM and bothtechnologies are important in the delivery of multimedia services. Thetable on page 9 summarises current and planned deployment of of ATM andSDH by a range of regional and national licensed TOs, managed networkservice providers and infrastructure suppliers.To date, most new operators are concentrating on building an initialmarket position with modern technology, but with a fairly basic rangeof services. Unless they choose to compete solely on price, a strategyat which only one operator can be successful, they will need to developnew services to maintain their revenues in the longer term."While modern technologies can help new players avoid many of thelegacy issues which affect the incumbents, they would be wrong toassume that it necessarily gives them a competitive advantage", says MrKnott. "New operators will have to translate technology capabilitiesinto end-user services such as LAN interconnection, Internet access,business video and interactive multimedia services, if they want tomaximise the value of their investment."Incumbent TOs will need to respond to these attacks across all of theirmarkets. The report contends that their best strategy for confrontingthe new operators may be to force the pace of competition byaggressively introducing new services. With entrants busy investing inexpanding infrastructure and coverage, incumbents could use theirfinancial strength to fund the development of a broader range ofintelligent network services, multimedia and personal mobilityfunctions. However, new entrants or established managed networkservices providers will also need to provide intelligent network-basedvoice services.The new entrants' initial infrastructure roll-out provides a ready mademarket for new SDH, ATM and fibre optic systems, and the desire tolaunch services as quickly as possible after 1998 means that manyoperators will want off-the-shelf products. Although new deployment ofbroadband infrastructure will provide growth in the short term, themajor opportunity for technology suppliers will be in developing andenhancing products which support innovative new services.InvestmentInvestment by utilities and other industrial companies has been afeature of new network development, says Mr Knott, with a  third of thetotal investment being contributed by them. Surprisingly, the financesector has contributed only around 15% of all direct investment,although this figure excludes loans and other funding arrangements withthe companies making the investment in infrastructure. The chart onpage 10 estimates the spread of sources of finance for new UKinfrastructure covering the period 1991-1996.A similar range of investors is already evident across the rest ofEurope, although a lack of data makes it impossible to assess therelative financial contributions of each group. Major groups ofcorporate investors include investment banks and similar institutions(Telenet Vlaanderen, ISIS Multimedia), public and private sectorutilities (Telivo, EnterTel, etc.) and parent industrial companies(Thyssen Telecom, Tele2, etc.).North American investment is widespread across Europe. The initial wavecoincided with the licensing of independent mobile network operators.This was followed by several regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs)taking stakes in the cable TV sector in France, Spain and Scandinavia,following their move into the UK cable market.  More recently this hasbeen followed by a wave of alliances with European partners seeking toenter voice telephony markets, an example of this being thecollaboration between BellSouth and Thyssen.Analysys Publications, tel: +44 (0)1223 460600.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996STREAM "FLOUTS" ITALIAN CABLE TV RULESStream, the multimedia division of Italian state telecom holdingcompany Stet and its subsidiary Telecom Italia, has announced plans toprovide TV programming services over the broadband fibre-optic networkunder construction by Telecom Italia, reports New Media Markets.However, Stream's plans may be thwarted by the Italian government'sdraft cable TV legislation which aims to prevent Telecom Italiabecoming a direct provider of broadcast-type TV services (MultimediaBusiness Analyst, 1/23/3 and 2/1/1).Stream hopes to begin offering a package of TV programming fromSeptember over the hybrid fibre optic/coaxial cable network beingdeployed by Telecom Italia. It plans to provide four cable TV channels,two premium pay-per-view channels and a home shopping service.Programming will cover films, music, documentaries and sport.Stream claims to be an independent programming distributor and saysthat, although initially it will provide programming over TelecomItalia's broadband network, it will consider using other operators'infrastructure - such as Videostrada, the Olivetti-US West jointventure - when this becomes available. However, analysts are dubiousabout the legal validity of Stream's argument, given that it isassuming responsibility for packaging, pricing and marketing and thatStream and Telecom Italia are part of the same organisation. TelecomItalia is seen as trying to get round the proposed ban on its providingentertainment services by using Stream.By the autumn, when Stream's programming service will start, TelecomItalia's broadband network should have reached 14 major cities, withoptical fibre in the trunk network and coaxial fibre running to thehome. By mid-1997 coverage should have been extended to 25-30 cities.Assuming that optical fibre costs fall sufficiently over the next threeyears, Telecom Italia hopes to start laying optical fibre to the homeby the end of 1998. It originally planned to deploy optical fibre to10m homes by late 1998, but merchant bankers Robert Fleming Securitiessays that it will achieve only a third of this number.Stream launches VOD trialStream and Telecom Italia launched a commercial trial of VOD servicesat the end of last month to 1,000 homes in Milan and Rome. TheVideomagic service runs over Telecom Italia infrastructure, initiallyproviding entertainment programmes, children's TV, local informationservices and home shopping. Stream plans to launch the servicecommercially in early 1997, making it available to Telecom Italia andother broadband network operators.Despite Telecom Italia's new policy of only using optical fibre formultimedia services, Stream is using asymmetric digital subscriber line(ADSL) technology in the Videomagic trial.

Each kiosk will house a virtual shopping mall in which thetrial participants will offer their wares for purchase by credit ordebit card. Around 100,000 members of the public are expected to usethe system during the lifetime of the trial.Virtual Precincts' managing director Alan Leibert says that the mall isnot a 100% replica of a standard high street in order to reflect theparticipation of mail order and direct-to-market companies as well aslocal authorities.London-based cable TV operator Videotron is supplying the 10Mbpsconnections linking the kiosks to SUMMON's server. Data is delivered inreal-time from the central database, allowing the system to be used tosell cinema, theatre and travel tickets. Towards the end of 1996,Virtual Precincts intends to offer SUMMON over coax cable TV links toset-top boxes in subscribers' homes, and is currently talking to anumber of possible equipment suppliers such as games consolemanufacturers.Mr Leibert says that unlike Cambridge Cable and BT's trials ofinteractive TV-based shopping, SUMMON is based on open standards,allowing participating retailers to reuse their "shops" on otherinteractive systems. SUMMON's use of the Internet's TCP/IP protocol andHTML language also means that, once sufficient bandwidth becomesavailable, the service could be offered over the Internet, says MrLeibert.Illustra, the US software company taken over by database giant Informixjust before Christmas, is supplying the multimedia relational databasetechnology for SUMMON. As the Illustra system is based on independentdata types, it is able to assemble HTML pages of information requestedby users "on the fly", says Mr Leibert.Cambridge-based smart card specialist General Information Systems isproviding the secure payment environment, based on a secure "pipe"running from each kiosk to a payment server sited alongside the mainserver but in a physically secure area. The payment server is connectedto the acquirer and authorisation networks operated by the various cardcompanies participating in the trial. Once a purchase transaction iscompleted, the kiosk prints a receipt for the customer.Suppliers participating in the project can either set up electroniclinks to their own fulfilment systems or take advantage of SUMMON'sfulfilment service.Other technology companies involved in SUMMON include Glenlake whichdesigned the virtual mall environment; Point 4 Consulting whichsupplied the Access/Register system to track activity at the kiosks;ICL's kiosk manufacturing unit; and Silicon Graphics which supplied thecentral server.Mr Leibert, a veteran of the smart card industry, says that VirtualPrecincts has decided not to seek finance from the City because of theshort-term approach taken by many investors.

Thenext step will be for governments to formulate guidelines for nationalpolicies with a further joint business-governmental session to provideprivate sector input scheduled for the first half of 1996.The development of a global electronic commerce market on the Internetpotentially worth over $300bn has led to calls from computer companiessuch as Microsoft and banks for the US government's strict controlsover the export of encryption algorithms to be relaxed.Currently, only businesses based in the US have access to high-level(128-bit) versions of Internet encryption software from companies suchas Netscape and Microsoft (Multimedia Business Analyst, 2/1/9-10). Theuniversal nature of the Internet means that any encryption softwaregoverned by export regulations cannot legally be distributed online asit risks being downloaded by users outside the US.Law enforcement agencies are concerned that if highly secure encryptiontechnology is exported, it may fall into the hands of money launderers,drug dealers and terrorists. They have therefore demanded the right tohack into computer transmissions for counter-intelligence and criminalinvestigation work in the same way that they are already able to taptelephone conversations.A significant feature of the Paris meeting was that business delegatesagreed in principle to allow such official access to take place as longas sufficient safeguards are in place and "electronic search warrants"are issued under due legal process. A number of governments appearwilling to permit relaxation of export controls on high-levelencryption devices as long as these safeguards are in place.Among the issues which experts on both sides need to resolve are theways in which private software "keys" allowing computer transmissionsto be decoded would be handled. The US government's proposed solution -the Clipper chip which would give its agencies "backdoor" access toprivate keys while unauthorised keys would be outlawed - has been hotlycontested by both US computer users and industry players such as Apple,AT&T, IBM and Microsoft.The Council of Europe's similar proposal, dubbed Euro-Clipper, has beenrejected by major commercial users, such as investment bank J.P.Morgan, which said they would take legal action against any move toforce them to use only approved encryption technologies.However, a number of business organisations have backed the EuropeanCommission's proposal to license trusted third-party escroworganisations, which would be independent of government, would hold thekeys and would hand them over to government investigators when theirdemands were justified. These could be telecom operators, postalauthorities or financial organisations with transaction expertise.According to CommunicationsWeek International, the EC expects to adopta directive backing the use of trusted third parties for encryption inthe first quarter of 1996.However, a number of critical issues need to be resolved such as howsuch custodians could be made legally liable for any unauthorisedaccess to encrypted information and for the costs of its misuse. In thehands of a totalitarian government, the legal power to hack into onlinenetworks or to read encrypted data contained on computers or smartcards could have very serious consequences.Analysts warn that if governments do not ensure secure communicationsin their countries and reasonable safeguards against unjustifedofficial intrusion, international companies are likely to transfertheir operations elsewhere.Moreover, a global solution to encryption is seen as essential.Businesses view the prospect of a patchwork of different national legalregimes governing encryption as highly undesirable, as this wouldseverely delay the advance of international electronic commerce overthe Internet.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA BUSINESS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996NTT DEVELOPS SECURE E-CASH SYSTEMNTT has developed a secure electronic cash system for smart cards andInternet-based transactions, reports Reuter.

First MediaInvestment Trust plc will focus on companies creating, owning,distributing or exploiting media assets and intellectual property. Itwill however not invest in hardware companies or directly in mediatitles. According to NatWest Securities, media stocks have been thethird-fastest-growing sector of the UK stock market since 1973.To be floated on the Stock Exchange at the end of January, First Mediaaims to place between 40m and 100m #1 ordinary shares, with warrantsattached, which will be used to buy stakes in quoted and unquoted mediacompanies around the world. Mr Scaife, a former head of the Europeanmedia and telecom team at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, expectsthe trust to raise more than #50m at flotation, given the commitmentshe has already received from a number of institutional investors. TheUK already has another specialist media investment trust, HeraldInvestment Trust plc. Set up two years ago by Rutherford AssetManagement to handle smaller quoted companies with marketcapitalisations under #300m, Herald raised #65m at flotation from 120institutional investors (Multimedia Business Analyst, 1/14/12-13).First Media, by contrast, is seeking to invest 30% of its assets inunquoted companies within a two-year period. It is targetinginstitutional investors, although small investors will be able to ownshares at the outset.Initially, 40% of First Media's portfolio will be in the US, with theremainder spread throughout Europe, although it may expand intoemerging markets. It will invest 35% of its portfolio in computer gamesand interactive multimedia stocks; 25% in cable and broadcast TVcompanies including listed conglomerates such as Viacom and Pearson;15% in film and TV producers; 10% in multimedia publishing supportservices such as 3D graphics; 5% in book and print publishing,particularly with CD-ROM tie-ups; and 10% in Internet companies,expected to be the growth stocks of the next century.The initial net asset value of the trust will be 97% of net proceeds. A1.5% annual management fee will apply, plus a 0.5% premium on dealingsin unquoted stocks.

In the future, DAVIC will tackle thedevelopment of standards for video servers, 3-D animation, high-quality video and sound, and network interfaces in the home, aDAVIC spokesman said.The new "DAVIC 1.0" standards, which allow for content andhardware interoperability, were adopted Dec. 16 in Berlin at theend of a weeklong series of meetings involving about 400 DAVICrepresentatives.  The International Telecommunication Union isexpected to ratify the standards this month.      DAVIC is acoalition of communications and entertainment companies that iscreating voluntary standards for digital audio and visualservices.  Council officials said earlier this year that thefirst set of standards would be adopted in December (MMD9/19/95).The new standards will enable equipment manufacturers to developnetwork hardware without having to worry about whether theirproduct conforms to proprietary standards, the spokesman said. In addition, programmers will be able to convert existing content- or develop new content - according to uniform specificationsfor digital systems.  The spokesman emphasized that the DAVICstandards process will be an "ongoing" effort, with additionalspecifications incorporated periodically into the standards.  Thecouncil's "highest priority" now is to develop cable modemspecifications for "DAVIC 1.1," he said.  DAVIC is working inconjunction with Cable Television Laboratories Inc. to developthose specifications.In the coming months, DAVIC also plans to develop specificationsfor Internet access, system security, return channels forsatellite TV transmission, and "modulation schemes" for wirelesscable TV service, the spokesman said.

Mark Maslowicz,Sega's UK software manager, said the delays would give cartridgesa life of little more than two years.Centregold operates from US, UK, France, Germany and Japan,incorporating publishers US Gold and Core Design, the budgetsoftware label, KIXX, and the software research and developmentcompany, Silicon Dreams, which has exclusive rights to theOlympics '96.Following the statement, Brown said the lack of dynamism in thegames cartridge industry could force it to give way to CD-ROM.According to Brown, the three months it takes to order, assembleand distribute games cartridges means that players cannot respondto the upswing or inertia of the market. As a result, businessesmay fail to supply an eager market in time or have shelves piledwith unwanted products. "You put your finger in the air," hesaid, "and see how it goes."The company's San Francisco outlet has taken the largest hit andis already moving towards PC CD-ROM, which takes one to two weeksto get onto the shelves giving a high, cheap turnover for a near-guaranteed market.The lack of dynamics in the market has meant that promises of 64-bit machines has kept customers waiting for their next purchase.As one observer asked, "would you buy a TV today if you knew a 3DTV was going to be out next year?"Centregold had GBP430,000 in 16-bit machines on the books at theend of last year and has been forced to drop its sell-on pricefrom GBP17 to GBP5 to shift GBP350,000 since then.Analysts say they had been expecting losses for some timealthough broker firm Smith New Court still predicts profits in1996. Durlacher believes the time to earnings is closer to threeyears and investments should not be earnings-based for at least12-18 months.Centregold's Geoff Brown believes the company has come out"unscathed" but this year he is setting his sights on selling40,000 units of the company's new football title, Fever Pitch,compared with sales of 300,000 units of the World Cup cartridgelast year."In about two years the money made on CDs will exceed the moneymade on cartridges," he said. "Admittedly, CD drives cost morebut cartridges cost more than CDs. In an ideal world everythingwould be on CD."Centregold's Geoff Brown sees the cartridge waning inmanufacturers' popularity. "16-bit cartridge is dead," he said."We've two more products then we'll leave it."Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995          INTEL SPELLS OUT NEW COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK                  TO DODGE HESITANT AUTHORITIESAs the US vice president vows to open telecoms markets, Intelexecutives have warned that Europe's restrictive telecomslegislation will motivate computer users to open newcommunications pathways via the Internet.In an exclusive interview with Multimedia Futures, ClaudeLeglise, Intel Corp's worldwide director of multimedia, warnedthat citizens would soon find new ways of communicating ifgovernments continued to avoid deregulation of the telecomsnetworks.Vice President Al Gore told ministers at the Group of Seveninformation technology conference on February 25, "whether by newlaw or new legislation we intend to open foreign investment intelecommunications services in the United States."The statement was backed by AT&T chief executive, Robert Allen,who said, "if the dominant telecoms operators of Europe are tobecome self-sufficient, profitable companies, they need thestimulus of a truly competitive market.According to Leglise, high charges for ISDN lines are "anartefact of government regulation". He highlighted the differencebetween the computer business and the telecoms business as one inwhich the first is impatient to find new ways to expand, theother loaded with legislation."One is right," he said, "the other is... not right.""Deregulation of communications services is what will make thisthing grow. In North America the cable companies want to get intothe phone business and the phone companies want to get into thevideo business. If none of these guys do anything, let me proposethat the computer industry and the computer users will startcreating their own (telecoms) network using Internet."February saw the birth of at least two Internet telephonecompanies: VocalTec Inc in tel Aviv, Israel (mf issue 2) andElectric Magic Co in San Francisco (mf issue 3). DigitalEquipment Corporation has also said it will market its ownInternet phone by June and Cirrus Logic Inc has expressed aninterest in licensing VocalTec's software.Although the software is still in its early stages, Leglise saidit is only a matter of a few years before the Internet, with aninfrastructure already laid and waiting for the innovation,becomes a cheap alternative to the telephone companies.He is critical of authorities for not responding to thesituation. "There was a time when the buggy manufacturers werenot worried about cars. It took 25 years but ultimately theyshould have been worried" he said. "There's a large history ofsmall companies that became big. Intel is one of them, Microsoftis another. What I'm saying is, it's pretty much inevitable.""The question really is will the authorities provide a frameworkthat will make it happen quickly or not. What they can influenceis really the pace, but not the outcome."Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995             BERTLESMANN BATTLES MICROSOFT NETWORKIn a bid to pre-empt Microsoft Network, Frankfurt, Germany-basedmedia giant, Bertelsmann AG has paid $50m for a 5% stake inAmerica Online.Bertelsmann has an option to increase its stake to 10% of theReston, Virginia-based company  while both will set up anequally-owned European online joint venture.

Rule 4.2 allows a company to be traded on a matchedbargain basis with no fixed price or market maker for shares. Thefractal technology the company uses has been pioneered by WalzerCorp of Jersey over the past two years.Viewcall will use the money raised to fund trials of its end toend system that enables VHS quality still pictures to be passedacross the telephone network at speeds that make it fast enoughfor on-line catalogue shopping, for example. The set-top boxdecoder in the home then decompresses those images for thecustomer.The decision on the location of the trial will be made in thenext six to eight weeks from a shortlist of three locations andshould be live in the third or early fourth quarter. Walzercurrently holds the largest stake in Viewcall and shareholdersnumber around 50; broker is London-based Astaire & Partners Ltd.The company has yet to confirm details of the manufacturer of thesystems and is holding back information on the details of thehardware and software until this is finalised.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995            TOSHIBA LAUNCHES 32-BIT R3900 RISC CORE                 FOR SET-TOPS AND HAND-HELD PDAsToshiba America Components Inc has launched a 32-bit R3900 RISCprocessor core for applications such as television set-top boxesand Personal Digital Assistants, claiming it achieves R4000-classperformance with 52.5 Dhrystone MIPS and power dissipation ofabout 400mW at 50MHz.The company has also built the core which it makes under licencefrom MIPS Technologies Inc, into Southern Cross, which itdescribes as a stand-alone microprocessor that enables users toevaluate the R3900 and shorten time-to-market.The 3900 offers variable instruction cache and data cache sizesand parameters and includes on-board power management functions.The part is also aimed at multimedia applications, facsimilemodems, games, laser printer controllers and X-terminals.The R3900 is the first RISC microprocessor that was fullyspecified by the Toshiba San Jose facility and was jointlydesigned with Toshiba's engineering facility in Kawasaki.The engineers took the standard R3000 architecture and designedit into a 26 square millimetre part with 4Kb instruction and 1Kbdata cache, giving it the MIPS I+ enhanced instruction set and amodified five-stage pipeline structure.The set adds built-in branch-likely instructions that eliminatethe no operation instructions from the program flow for morecompact code, and there is a built-in one-cycle Multiplier andAccumulation operation to reduce the multiplication and additionfunctions into a single operation to provide signal processor-like functions to enhances graphics and communicationscapabilities.The part runs off a 3.3V supply.

Thruglass TouchPads - threedifferent sizes from 1" by 1" to 4" by 3" - can be affixed to theback of photos or graphics  on the inside of a store window.When a person outside touches the glass minute changes in thevoltage field are detected by the Thruglass controller, whichpasses the selection to the computer. Sound is also availablewith the system as is a sixteen pad keyboard.The beauty of the system is its low-cost - just $500 for theThruglass equipment - to which must be added the price of a 486PC and authoring software to develop a demonstration.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995                CNET CELEBRATES DIAMOND JUBILEE                WITH FIBRE-OPTIC 140Mbps ATM LINKThe Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications (CNET)France's $500m national research giant, celebrated its fiftiethanniversary in Paris by demonstrating France's Telecom's first140Mbps fibre optic point-to-point Asynchronous Transfer linkwith Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG's CNET equivalent inDarmstadt.CNET announced its research targets over the next five years willbe technologies that will affect "planet telecommunications"Asynchronous Transfer Mode - a technology it pioneered -multimedia services, whether they be revamped PC versions ofMinitel or interactive cable television systems, mobile systemsand intelligent agents for filtering data from mobile or fixedon-line services.It is currently working to upgrade its Minitel viewdata servicesfor mail order, medical services, tourism, encyclopaedic andeducational sectors in France.Michel Feneyrol, director of CNET said: "Between 26% and 30% ofthe services we have now will be interested in having imagesadded and in more sophisticated, multimedia version of theirservices."Services using fixed images will appear on personal computersbetween now and 2000, while services with moving images onpersonal computers or televisions will appear by the turn of thecentury, he added.CNET and the national telecomms provider France Telecom, arefocusing on developing new on-line services and systems forbilling and network access, which they have perfected in 10 yearsthrough operating the Minitel viewdata system.Overall, Feneyrol believes that CNET will most probablyconcentrate its R&D in software because "we see productivity withsoftware engineering tools growing much more slowly than, say,the capacity of fibre optics".France Telecom demonstrated the results of its partnership withGeneral Magic Inc on the use of intelligent agents to improveuser interfaces for telematic services."Our strategy, with General Magic is to add the nomadic dimensionto Teletel," said Jacques Guichard, associate director at CNET incharge of multimedia.The first market experiments using intelligent agents arescheduled for next year. The applications, using personalcommunicators from Sony Corp and Motorola Inc., are beingdeveloped by France Telecom, General magic Inc and Philips PACE.Gateways enable the communicators to interrogate existing Teleteldatabases such as those of the national railway and highwayauthorities.Many of the CNET's development projects are currently beingexhibited as part of the 50th anniversary celebration, at theScience City in Parc de la Villette, Paris until May 28.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995         WHIRLPOOL DEMOS COOK-ON-DEMAND VOICE KITCHENThe 'kitchen of the future' will cook on demand when Whirlpoolinstalls Voice Powered Technology's VoiceLogic technology inkitchen applicances, but it will not allow you to shout at it.The KitchenAid division of Whirlpool Corp has demonstrated speechrecognition in an oven, a refrigerator, a dishwasher and awashing machine at the National Association of Home Buildersannual convention in Houston, Texas.Whirlpool is currently reviewing the possibilities of using thespeech recognition technology from Canoga Park, California-basedVoice Powered Technology Inc. Whirlpool will not set a date forKitchenAid Voice Command products to hit the shops until it hasfully evaluated the potential demand.Speech recognition is about 97% accurate but still requires usersto press a button before speaking the commands. Voice PoweredTechnology said there is still no reliable method for removingbackground noise from the audio input."You can't just go into a room and yell at it," said aspokesperson.The system requires a short training session by each 'kitchenuser' who speaks around 30 words into the microphone. Then, inthe case of an oven, cooks can speak keywords like "prime rib","eight pounds" and "six pm", leaving the calculations to theappliance.Voice Powered Technology said it has been "looking to license tohome products for some time".

The companyhopes to have 6m - almost half the company's 13m subscribers -using interactive television by 2001.It is usual for companies to install a small number, often lessthan 3000, to test the technology and marketing prospects ofinteractive television in the area.DEC said the technology was so well known now that it made littlesense to meander into the technology, particularly as the cablinginfrastructure had to be upgraded anyway."There's nothing really substantial to be gained from a trial,"said a spokesperson. "Ameritech and other regional Bell companiesare already spending billions on new infrastructure. They mightas well go right ahead and install media servers."The contract is worth $40m to Digital and $400m to ScientificAtlanta which will supply analogue and digital set-top terminalsand remote controls. The remaining balance went to ADCTelecommunications which got a six-year contract worth up to $35mfor cabinets placed in neighbourhoods to house the link betweenthe fibre-optic network and coaxial cables running tosubscribers' homes.Nynex Corp, which is also using DEC and Scientific Atlanta, isplaying safer with a 2,500 installation in three apartment blockson Manhattan Island.The company plans to expand quickly now that it has FederalCommunications Commission approval. It said it does not considerManhattan to be a trial but a starting point.Nynex recently won its application for trading video serviceswithin its own catchment area under the FCC rule 2.14 (mf issue2). The rule has allowed telephone companies to supply videoservices to their own telephone customers since 1992 providingthey obtain permission from the FCC.DEC also said that even though the technology was solid enough tobuild an infrastructure straight off, there were stilldevelopments to be made that would bring the cost of installationdown."It's not as if there's no more innovation to go. It's just aquestion of cost-reducing innovation," said the company'sspokesperson.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995                   INFOMERCIALS DEBUT IN UKInfomercials have begun in Europe for the first time as UKcompanies fight for growing advertising revenues and Carltonsecures Children's ITV as its first customer for the SpotPlusinteractive commercial.Carlton TV, part of Carlton Communications, is the UK's largestindependent television company since it bought Birmingham'sCentral TV less than a year ago. Carlton hopes the initiative cankeep it ahead of Granada TV, the UK's number two. Advertisingrevenues are forecast by to grow 6% this year.Infomercials have been operating in the US for two years now bytelevision companies such as CBS and this is the firstintroduction to Europe.SpotPlus is a way for advertisers to add more information about aproduct by screening extended details at 5.30 in the morning. Anumber is displayed with the main advert and, by keying thisnumber into a VideoPlus remote control, the viewer sets theirvideo recorder to record the early morning commercialwhen air-time costs are at their lowest.SpotPlus infomercials cost GBP9,000 for the three and a halfminute slot compared with up to GBP1m in prime-time.Children's ITV Interactive magazine (CITV), an interactivetelevision programme, is the first advertiser to make use of theinfomercial slot, which has been on trial since November lastyear. The extended portion of the commercial will demonstrate howto access the programme using a PC and a modem and offers achance to win a Compaq Presario 520.Martin Bowley, managing director of sales at Carlton UK, seesthis as an opportunity for companies such as travel firms and carmanufacturers to use prime-time advertising space for briefcommercials which will include pointers to more in-depthinformation.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995            NTL PROMISES TERRESTRIAL DIGITAL TV ON                 CONVENTIONAL SETS IN UK BY 1997NTL, claiming the world's most ambitious terrestrial broadcastingproject, is promising UK viewers 12 digital channels using normaltelevision sets and aerials by 1997.National Transcommunications Ltd was the engineering arm ofIndependent Television (ITV) before being privatised in 1991 andcurrently has a turnover of around GBP115m. It claims 30% of theworld market for video compression products other thantransmission equipment.Based on MPEG-2 video compression, digital television is claimedto improve the quality of broadcast signals and permit televisioncompanies to offer services such as interactive programming andwide screen TV. The broadcast quality of digital televisionenables television to compete more equally with cable andsatellite.NTL said the digital system will adhere to normal televisionequipment as much as possible, adding a GBP300 set-top unit todecode the digital signals to a conventional stereo PAL colour TVsignal. It expects the project to cost "tens of millions" ofpounds.The digital broadcast started at the end of February on757.25MHz, known as UHF Channel 34, carrying four additionalprogrammes in digital format in place of the normal PAL channel.Reuters reports that NTL's plans throw down the gauntlet to theUK government and its state-funded British BroadcastingCorporation. In its June 1994 White Paper, the government linkedthe introduction of digital broadcasting to the privatisation ofthe BBC transmission network.NTL does not want to be relegated to second place because ofdelays in broadcast legislation, causing it to lose leverageagainst cable companies, already in reach of 4.4m homes in theUK."Above all, we ask that the BBC must not be given a favouredposition," said NTL chief executive, Andy Sukawaty.NTL has already offered to provide digital transmission of theBBC's channels and is waiting its reply. It has already expressedan interest in buying the BBC's transmission arm when it isprivatised, claiming it could make savings of up to #20m bycombining the assets of the two companies.Digital transmission could bring back Channel Five, a stationwhich was to use channel 35 in the TV spectrum but was rejectedby the broadcasting industry because companies licensing thechannel would have to pay several million of pounds to convert orre-tune customer's VCRs.The reintroduction of Channel Five could improve the chances ofregional and minority broadcasts.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995                    IBM ANNOUNCES POWER 602IBM Corp and Motorola Inc have announced the PowerPC 602, aimedat applications such as games machines and television set-topboxes.The 602 is the part 3DO Co will use in its M2 Accelerator for theInteractive Multiplayer.Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd intends to use it in its64-bit 3DO systems.

The technology provides muchfaster access to information services and is claimed to beessential for the successful take-up of video telephony.Subscriber charges for ISDN are currently based on the number oflines. The FCC wants to introduce a new charging structure thatwill charge for the number of channels within the line. BasicRate ISDN can have up to three channels per line, while PrimaryRate ISDN lines can have up to 24 channels.Under the new rate schedule for Basic Rate SDS, Home and CentrexISDN services, Pacific Bell customers will be charged for one,two or three lines, depending on the configuration. Primary RateISDN customers will be charged for either 23 or 24 lines.Pacific Bell said the new charging structure will raise BasicRate Home and Centrex ISDN prices by up to 29%, SDS ISDN pricesby up to 43% and Primary Rate customers by up to 50%.Pacific Bell issued a formal request to the FCC to waive Section69.104 of the ruling, allowing the company to retain its currentmethod of charging by line rather than channel."ISDN has become a very cost-effective way to enter theInformation Superhighway," said John Gueldner, Pacific Bell'svice president of regulatory affairs."But now, the mandated increase in ISDN line charges is a majorroadblock. Pacific Bell has made a concerted effort to keep itsprices for ISDN lines affordable."He criticised the FCC for wanting to introduce a damaging mandate"at the very time that ISDN is growing rapidly among small tomedium-sized businesses"."These price increases will severely curtail this growth," hesaid, adding that they could even reverse this enthusiasm to thepoint of impeding future research into the technology.Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of the Pacific Telesis Group, providesISDN services to areas in California.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995           AUSTRALIA PUTS GBP5BN INTO VOICE-TO-VIDEOAustralia Telecom is planning a GBP4,600m venture to upgrade itscable network to include a new voice-to-video broadband network.The planned infrastructure will improve the service of cabletelevision and introduce new features such as broadband telephonyand video conferencing.Time scales were not available from the telecommunicationscompany but the plans would mean bringing forward the upgrade ofAustralia's cable system, which is the basis of a pay-per-viewventure between Australia Telecom and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.Telecom's cable network is currently under construction and isintended to connect 4m homes at a cost of GBP1.64m over the nextfour years. Current plans run the cable alongside copper wiretelephony.Australia Telecom's chief executive, Frank Blount, confirmed tothe Australian Financial Review that the national carrier isreviewing the economics of maintaining and upgrading a phonenetwork based on a copper wire technology that is rapidlybecoming obsolete.Although Blount would not be drawn on the costs of an integratednetwork, the Federal Government appointed Broadband ServicesExperts Group has said that a network of this kind would cost "inexcess of (GBP4,600m)".Blount said that he intended to keep telephony separate fromTelecom's pay-per-view venture with Murdoch, but NationalAustralia Bank's magazine, Decisions, quotes Blount as saying,"if we can make a case that we're going to integrate telephonyand broadband at the same time, we may be able to see our way tojustifying that kind of expenditure and wire up the wholecountry".Faced with the distances involved in the project, Blountacknowledged that satisfying demand in a sparsely populatedcountry would be difficult but the company planned to use centralpoints in towns, such as libraries, as the broadband accesspoints from which homes could then be connected.The move being explored by Telecom would complement strategiesmapped out for the development of a broadband services industryto be unveiled by the Government through the release of the finalBSEG report, said the Australian Financial Review.Australia Telecom's rival, Optus Vision, is using digitaltechnology to deliver pay-per-view and telephony on aninfrastructure that could be expanded to video telephony. Optus'system drops optical fibre and coaxial cable to homes mostly hungfrom overhead power cables.Australia Telecom and News Corp are fine-tuning their pay-per-view venture with a strong alliance with satellite licensee,Australis Media Ltd. Telecom-News and Australis are considering across-equity arrangement under which there will be an allotmentof shares and options.

Volume of information is the key. Each disk canhold the equivalent of 300,000 pages of text - each disk holds640Mb of information. The CD-ROM drive and a sound card providethe baseline Multimedia PC (MPC) configuration.                             CD-ROMThe number of drives shipped in 1993 soared by 170 per cent onthe previous year to 7.2 million worldwide. Research by Infotechsuggests that by 1999, 8 out of every 10 computers will have aCD-ROM drive attached. The reason for the take-up is three fold:they are cheap, they work and, with the increasing bulk ofWindows software, they fulfil a very useful function.As with all emerging technologies, pricing is the key. CD-ROMdrives are available to computer dealers for under $100. They arealso being heavily pushed by software giants such as Microsoft,which has used the increased user base of the drives deliver arange of innovative software that takes advantage of CD ROM'smassive storage capability by allowing the user to run videoclips or search huge databases.The Yellow Book standard for CD-ROM was set in 1986 by PhilipsElectronics NV and Sony Corp. This set of guidelines for how datawas compressed and laid down onto the tracks of the disk.Further standards allowed for compressed audio to be interwovenwith data - CD-ROM XA. The emerging Orange Book standard, whichis still under development, covers CD-R (recordable CD-ROM). Atpresent CD-ROM disks can only be record in one pass, unlikemagneto-optical (MO) disks and is a drawback of CD-ROM - that,although it is very cheap for software houses to publish softwareonto it - it is more expensive than conventional MO disks forordinary users to save data to.The other CD-ROM standards relate to the drives themselves. Theoriginal MPC (Multimedia PC) standard stated that the drive musthave a 'sustained data transfer rate' of at least 150Kb persecond, while using no more than 40 per cent of the CPU.This standard was soon superseded, as a data transfer of 150Kbpsproved too slow to accurately produce seamless video on screen. Asecond generation of 'dual speed' CD-ROM drives, which read thedisks at speeds of 300Kbps and above, have been developed bymanufacturers including NEC Corp, Pioneer Corp and Toshiba Corp.The new MPC2 standard reflects the requirement for digital videostored on disk.                       VIDEO CONFERENCINGThe second successful usage of multimedia technology is fullmotion video images run on a PC. This technology - primarilydriven by advances in compression algorithms - means that fasterand better quality video can be played on the PC.The obvious and concrete benefits for business are apparent:Computer Based Training (CBT), presentations, point of saledisplays and - potentially the one with the widest impact - videoconferencing.Video Conferencing is an area of concerted development for largecompanies such as Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, mainly becausethe technology developed for businesses will also crossover tothe perceived lucrative area of domestic video-on-demandservices.Both Intel and high end workstation provider Silicon Graphics Inchave developed video conferencing systems for the PC - althoughboth have been held back by the limitations of the personalcomputer which when it was originally designed, or as it evolved,was not expected to survive in so many manifestations.As a consequence, video data can be sent at speed along ISDNlines (although even these are slow offering 64 or 128Kbpscompared with fibre optic cables which can run parallel channelseach containing many megabits per second) but is broughtshuddering to a halt when it gets to the PC."The biggest bottleneck on sending and receiving video is thesystem bus" said Silicon Graphics Steve Webb.""Development there has not kept pace with processor development."Launched in mid-1993, the Silicon Graphics Indy Workstation wasthe first PC system built for dedicated peer-to-peer videoconferencing. It came with a 30 frames per second video camerabolted to the top of the monitor and an ISDN port.On the Intel platform, the struggle has been to improve thecompression of the mass of video data coming into the PC. Intelitself released its Smart Video Recorder and Indeo compressioncard in April 1993, but admitted that peer-to-peer videoconferencing required compression beyond what was available atthe time.Intel limited its efforts to allowing PC users to view videoclips and this is where video on the desktop has stalled for awhile.Many of the technical problems with the PC's capacity to handlevideo have since been improved but there is one major obstacle toovercome.The lack of a nation-wide fibre optic cabling structure meansthat video conferencing will - initially, at least  - be limitedto within a specific site, rather than over wider sites where itis really most useful.                          POINT OF SALEPoint of Sales Kiosks are a spin-off from PC video conferencing,but a spin-off with, real spin. Point of Sales (POS) kiosks aredesigned to run full motion video product demonstrations forcustomers. The more sophisticated can also provide a 'real time'video link to remote sales staff.The Thomas Cook multimedia travel kiosk - at the firm's flagshipMarble Arch branch - is a good example of POS multimedia inaction.Using a system developed and installed by Olivetti, prospectivetourists are wafted to their dream destinations without evenhaving to leave the travel agents. The system, which ended itstrials in prototype in mid-1994, uses 17" touchscreen to allowcustomers to access video and audio presentations of popularholiday destinations.The POS system is more than just a fancy travel brochure. It hasan integrated video link so the customer could call up asalesperson in the top corner of the screen. The system evenaccepts electronic payment by credit card."Pushy sales staff scare off more customers than technology,"says the Inteco Inc research firm, adding that certain types ofretail operations - where the products being sold are technicalor sophisticated - are better suited to selling by kiosk thanothers.The Thomas Cook system was based around a 486 PC with videocamera and board, ISDN connector, CD-ROM drive and, mostimportantly, a touchscreen. Previous research has shown that thekeyboard is the major cause of fear and loathing amongst the non-computer-literate.The real interest with multimedia kiosks though, is as aprecursor for the world of home shopping.This is where much of the development is, with the idea that theuser can summon up product information and make purchases fromtheir own home. The first moves in the UK have been through Inteland Microsoft signing up with US cable companies to provide alimited form of 'video-on-demand.' Multimedia kiosks are seen asa link to the lucrative world of home interactive shopping.                               CBTComputer Based Training (CBT) and Presentations were the firstreal uses of multimedia, and are still the biggest employers ofinteractive technology.CBT is primarily a way for the largest companies to standardisethe training that they give employees - by making sure thateveryone gets exactly the same message at the same time.Multimedia sales presentations have traditionally been thepreserve of the largest corporates, which usually focus more onan identical message tailored by bespoke software providers, thanon any egalitarian cutting edge technology.The growth in CBT and presentations has come as they have beenopened up to smaller companies and developers, fuelled by thelaunch of multimedia authoring tools.The market leader for Windows authoring packages is MultimediaToolbook 3.0 from Asymetrix, which allows full-motion videoediting and the incorporation of video on the desktop. Theprogramme can then be imported into a more conventionalpresentation package. As the use of multimedia extends to theless bold, authoring tools will be used by wider  audiencesdeveloping a broader range of interactive applications.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995                      ****** EVENTS ******Mar 15 - 17, 1995The Television ShowThe Business Design CentreIslington, London, UKNow in its fifth year, this is Europe's biggest production eventfor producers and production professionals within the film, videoand television industry.

"They ought to be looking at the USinvestment community based on the M-2."Tabizel also voiced concern about Matsushita's involvement withother manufacturers such as Panasonic Co and Japanese Victor Co."They're hedging their bets," he said.Trip Hawkins said that the M-2 accelerator was scheduled to beshipping later this year. He also claimed that the accelerator,and other manufacturing cost savings that he would not specify,could take $100 off the $400 3DO price tag.The timing of M-2's release is vital against other platforms duefor release, he said."M-2 is going to transform 3DO into one of the most feasibleplatforms," he said, although he added that it depends on thesuccessful release of other 64-bit machines such as Sony'sPlaystation and Nintendo's Ultra."Atari's Jaguar, he said, is"nearly dead in the water".3DO shares took a hit in May last year, falling 20% when Hawkinswas reported to be putting $10m of his own money into the companyto support it over 1995.However, the company said Hawkins had always put his own moneyinto the company.

The imager sits in a special electronic backfixed to the body of a Nikon N90 camera.The DCS 460 is a 'multi-megapixel' camera that does not requiremultiple exposures to render a single colour image, acharacteristic that limits other cameras to still lifephotographed in a studio. Kodak claims the single exposure cameraincrease portability to the field or the studio.Time taken between power-on and the first shot is 0.25 secondswith about 12 seconds between shots while the camera saves theimage to disk. The DCS 460 can store images on removable PCMCIA-ATA cards and includes a battery pack that is claimed to providepower for over 300 images in a single charge.Sound annotation can be included in the image for tagging oridentifying the image with a built-in microphone.The imager for the DCS 460 is available separately as the DCS 465Digital Camera Back. The digital imager fits to the body of 4" by5" SLR devices. Pricing was not available.In February, Sony Corpchallenged Kodak's Photo CD by joining Japanese camera company,Konica Corp, to develop a digital imaging system that recordsfilm on Sony's 2.5" Mini Discs.Sony's system enables users to record images from photographicnegative films, slides, prints and printed materials directlyonto the optical disks, and edit the recorded images andmanipulate them into various formats. The system comprises animage recorder, an image processor and a scanner. Up to 200images can be written on one disk, and it takes seven seconds torecord one negative.

The Exhibition was the world's chanceto show off the latest and greatest technology and gave theanalysts of the age an opportunity to discuss what could be doneto make it better.Almost 150 years later, G-7 ministers in Belgium over the weekendof February 25/26 were surrounded by a trade fair of scientificsorcery from more than 100 of the world's leading technologyfirms.The amazement was apparent as delegates watched demonstrationsincluding machines to check hand prints instead of passports,two-way educational link ups for schoolchildren in isolated areasand virtual reality guided tours of world museums.Winding up the conclusion of the Conference, the Chair said, "Lestemps est venu." The time has come... again.But the G-7 conference differs from its Victorian equivalent isthat the participants do not believe we are creating a perfectworld.Jaques Delors, chairman of the Information Society Round Tablesaid, "I am not saying that a globalised world will be betterthan a non-globalised one. Maybe we lived better in the 15thCentury... one must face reality."This reality has added two uncomfortable lessons to theunswerving passion that enthused the Victorians to considertheirs the"period of most wonderful transition" that held theworld for a little under a century.The fact that some countries have lagged the technological leapsof the US, Europe and Japan has not been lost on the G-7'sministers. To avoid a two-tier system, ministers are talking ofbringing developing countries up to speed by allowing them to"leap-frog" the technological evolution over which they havepresided. Open access to networks and the equality of opportunityare central principles of the G-7 framework.But jumping evolutionary stages and avoiding the instability thatcan occur in economies swamped by technological revolution is noeasy process.In cases such as Singapore, which is small enough to share thebenefits equally among its population, little administration isneeded.In others, with urban and rural areas so far apart that wholecultures differ within the country, the two can work in conflict.As one economist pointed out, the conference would not attempt tosolve the world's problems, but the adverse affects of hastyevolution is evident in the trade wars between US and China.China, like Japan, has been leap-frogging technology for yearsand the US, having most to gain from deregulated competition dueto a massive and highly sophisticated telecommunicationsinfrastructure, is aware of the threat to fair competition thatis inherent in an unbalanced global system.China suffers - or will suffer - from a culture that has notgrown up with copyright law and expects the black market to actas a valid sector of the economy. That same culture will find itdifficult to marry urban and rural areas when faced with thescale of telecommunications multimedia.Technology can be treated as an exogenous variable in economics,driving or being driven by a country's internal money system.Small countries such as Singapore can benefit easily if the gainsdue to technology can be distributed quickly and fairly around asmall population.But a country the size of China, or the former Soviet Union,requires a stronger hold on the infrastructure and educationThabo Mbeki, South Africa's vice president, sees investment indomestic labour as the greatest benefit G-7's ministers can offerhis country.He sees his society becoming a mere consumer of informationunless foreign companies move manufacture to the newlydemocratised country. "Come and make your computers in Ghana," hesaid. "Come and make them in South Africa."If the US gets its way and Al Gore, chieftain of its informationrevolution, opens its telecommunications market to foreigninvestment "up to 100%", there seems a much reduced role for theauthorities.Computer standards - like governmental regulation, customarilysubject to the chore of an administration - have been in thehands of the industry for years. But there is a centraldistinction between the computer industry, with its competitive,consumer-driven motivation, and the telecommunications industrywhich has been the ward of government since it replaced therailways.It is a familiar saying by now that free trade tends to beadvocated by those people who have most to be gained from it.Two weeks after the Great Exhibition of the 19th Century, theeditor of Illustrated London News pointed to the hoards ofworking men and women who swarmed around the exhibits, "the menwho made the Exhibition what it is, and who, we fervently hope,will derive the greatest advantage from it."Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995                      OUTSOURCING THE NETCERN has passed responsibility for the Internet to MIT and theFrench research institute, INRIA. Marsha W Johnston talks to theInternet's adopted parents.In the coming months, network security and commercialisationissues, such as how to create paying services, will be thehighest priority subjects for Internet development, says OlivierMuron, director of promotions and technology transfer forFrance's National Institute of Research in Informaticsand Automation (INRIA).Up until a few weeks ago, INRIA was just another Internet servicelocation and Muron's sentiment would have been just another Webuser's speculation. But following an agreement with the EuropeanCentre for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, INRIA, along withthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is nowresponsible for supporting and managing the evolution of WorldWide Web (W3) technology.CERN has been the centre of W3 technology since Tim Berners-Lee,a CERN researcher, invented it in 1989. That the invention camefrom the elite international community of high-energy physics wasnot surprising, since it "is a very geographically distributedand computer-literate community that has been using computernetworks to distribute documents and for email for a long time,"says Mike Sendall, secretary for CERN's Large Hadron Collider(LHC) experiments committee.W3 was a welcome development because it alleviated thephysicists' headache of using multiple, incompatible networksaround the world to exchange the voluminous test data that iscritical to better understanding the behaviour of the universe.Having invented W3 technology, CERN naturally developed as thecentre of the standardisation effort for 'The Net' (akaInternet). "In the early days of The Net, it was entirelyappropriate for us to be the focus of activity," Sendall says.Today, however, there is an entirely different story. No longeris the Internet the privileged domain of a largely academiccomputer user audience. The Internet Society reported that newNet subscribers grew 22% in the fourth quarter of 1994, while the(.)net domain, used largely by commercial service providers, grewat an astonishing 66%. At this rate, the society predicts the Netwill count 100 million hosts by 1998."The centre of gravity has shifted, if you like; the Net is nowof much broader interest than just to our community," Sendallsaid, by way of explaining why CERN chose to disengage itselffrom W3  development and promotion."It was a question of the amount of work there is to do and towhat extent it maps onto CERN's mission," said Sendall. He addedthat the approval in December of the Collider project made itincreasingly difficult for CERN to continue its historic W3 role.At the time, Sendall was already in discussions with MIT and theEuropean Commission on establishing joint European/US support forthe W3 standards. "Both the EC and CERN wanted a strong Europeanpresence with the standard and INRIA seemed like a good bunch ofpeople to take it over," he said.Indeed, INRIA has been the starting point for some of France'shottest young information technology companies, including ObjectOriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS) developer O2Technology, C++ tools editor ILOG and SGML expert Grif. Asidefrom running its own professional Web service.INRIA developed a Web service '100 Years of Light in thePaintings of French Museums' for the Ministry of Culture and wasretained by the EC as a 'national host' for advanced Web servicesin its Advanced Communications Technologies & Services."INRIA has done quite a lot of Web development. They have notplayed a big role in central standardisation issues, but they arequite experienced in networking and security issues," Sendallsaid, adding that those are the two most important areas for TheNet at this stage.No decisions have yet been made on how to split developmentduties, he said. Service support will be "divided up more or lessgeographically to minimise our telecom charges, but it will betransparent to the user," he said.Broadly stated, however, INRIA and MIT's work will comprise fourmain areas:- evolution of Web components, including the markup language,html, the client/server dial-up protocol, http, and url, theuniversal residence locator;- development of a reference code;- supply of general information about the Web; and- promotion of the technology and its distribution.Sendall said CERN will continue Web developments that aretargeted specifically at its own user community, rather thangenerally focused issues.Muron places great importance on the informational aspect ofINRIA's charter. "We have to provide enough detailed informationabout the Web so that someone who doesn't know anything about itcould learn on their own how to use W3 technology," he said.In the meantime, INRIA is planning an increase in its own Webservice. "To pass the level of directory service consultation asCERN's, which is automatically accessed by thousands of usersevery day, we need bigger workstations and increased networkcapacity," he said.Sendall is not worried that CERN's departure will cause standardsto evolve away from the users. "We use lots of other standardsthat we don't define."Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995                   REAL ACTORS TAKE A BREAKVirtual actors are to be used in a commercial for RowntreeMacintosh to be screened in May.Rowntree, a subsidiary of Swiss food giant, Nestle SA, hascontracted Snapper Productions, a London-based productioncompany, to make the commercial using a virtual simulationtechnique known as Motion Analysis.Details of the production are a closely guarded secret but RobertGoldbold, the producer of the commercial, said the techniquesused were "like nothing before".Motion Analysis begins with a digital coding technique calledCyberscanning which captures colour and texture data such as thaton a person's face. The data is then "wrapped around a geometricwire-frame" and animated.Cinesight Ltd, a digital production house working on LawnmowerMan 2 in London and Los Angeles, said it was not aware of anyother commercial using this technique.The lack of virtual reality technology in commercials wasemphasised by Pat Joseph, production director for The Mill, whichrecently made an advert for the Nationwide building society , thesecond biggest in the UK. The Mill's advert merged an image ofAlfred Hitchcock with a lookalike reading the script."There's very little VR in television commercials at the moment,"he said, stressing that although using technology to sell wasimpressive, "the most effective commercials are still the comicones".Walt Disney Co has registered a patent that manipulates videotextures such as the face of a recording of a live actor.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995            VIRTUAL SCHOOLING TRAVELS TO 14 STATESThe US West Foundation will be taking virtual reality across 14states to schools which are unable to motivate children tolearning.The Foundation is the philanthropic arm of telecommunicationscompany, US West Inc, which spent $1.2m of its annual $25m budgeton the project.Two Virtual Reality Roving Vehicles (VRRVs) were proposed by theFoundation in collaboration with the University of Washington'sHuman Interface Technology Laboratory (HIT Lab) and UK virtualreality systems firm, Division Ltd. The vehicles are actuallyjust vans carrying the virtual development equipment to schoolsacross US West's 14 state territory.Virtual reality environments are ideal for stimulating childrenwho are not attending classes to take a more active role in thelessons, according to Jane Prancan, executive director of theFoundation.Children and teachers are taught to use a menu-driven version ofDivision's authoring software, dVise, to build virtualenvironments in which they can move around rainforests or see themovements of molecules."It does require kids who put the virtual environment together todo a lot of their own research," she said.Clive Jones, a marketing manager for Division, said the menu-driven system was far easier to use than language-basedprogramming environments.Bringing up a menu, the children can choose shapes and colours,positions and constraints, then scale or colour the virtualworld, he said. The developing environment enabled children tocreate worlds with icons on screen or author on the fly in free-space."The object of the programme is to bring in interest fromstudents who are switched off from schooling," he said, "using itas a stimulus to bring them back into the learning process."The Foundation first took the VRRVs to Garfield High School, aschool in a low-income, high-minority area of Seattle,Washington. The vehicles will cover the rest of Washington beforemoving on to Nebraska. The VRRV is also intended to be taken intorural areas where technology is not given the funding affordedmetropolitan schools.Division donated one third of the cost of the two GBP65,000ProVision 100 systems and head mounted displays and the companyis keen to increase its presence in educational products like theVRRV. It is currently involved in the 'Train to Travel' projectin Miami which uses virtual reality to teach mentallydisadvantaged children to use the local bus service.The Foundation, which has donated more than $50m over the pasttwo years, also funded a $550,000 project in Denver, Colorado, tocreate the on-line Families and Children Network launched inFebruary in partnership with advice agencies, in particular thenational non-profit network, HandsNet, and the Centre for HumanInvestment Policy (CHIP) at the University of Colorado, Denver.The Network links families to consultants in professional adviceagencies.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995           RENDERMORPHICS 3D APIs DUE FOR WINDOWS96Microsoft has acquired RenderMorphics to include 3D applicationinterfaces in versions of Windows after Windows95.London-based RenderMorphics Ltd has been converting its RealityLab 3D rendering library to run on a variety of operating systemsincluding Windows NT 3.5 for iAPX-86, WinG, Alpha, PowerPC andthe next release of the Sony Playstation.All employees will be brought into the Microsoft fold.

The on-line service provider had 600,000subscribers in January 1994.Lorraine Sileo, an on-line analyst for Simba Information Inc,admitted she found it hard to believe America Online's successwas sustainable but the company's low and predictable connectioncosts would put it at the head of its competitors for some time.Although America Online claims to have spread "through word ofmouth", she said it had gained a considerable number ofsubscriptions from the access software being included in bundleswith PCs. America Online spokesperson, Pam McGraw, refused tocomment on how many subscriptions arose from PC bundles.Sileo said affordable charges with no surprise bills was the mostimportant factor to families. "You know what your bills are goingto be," she said.While this applies to present competition such as Compuserve Incand Prodigy Services Co, Sileo also drew attention to theMicrosoft Network as a potential victim to home consumers'prerequisites, citing too few free areas and the possibility ofan unreliable launch."Microsoft probably won't launch until the end of the yearconsidering its anti-trust problems," she said, "and when it doesI don't think it will have the content. There will probably bemore premium services (than America Online). Right now AmericaOnline doesn't have to worry about the Microsoft Network."Refusing to comment on America Online's competition, McGraw saidthe success was due to the mix of features and affordable priceof the on-line service.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA FUTURES via NewsNetMarch 06, 1995          LONG-DISTANCE PROVIDERS GET "WAKE-UP CALL"                    FROM NETPHONE ON INTERNETThe pending Internet telephone service is a "wake-up call" topurveyors of long-distance telecommunications, said Andrew Green,founder and president of Electric Magic Company in San Francisco.The three-year-old company is currently sampling a demo versionof its voice Internet software product, NetPhone, over the WorldWide Web.Because of the proprietary nature of the few Internet Phonemethodologies now hitting the market, long distance carriers arenot under a threat - for the moment, Green said."I see Internet telephone service as an inspiration and a wake-upcall to the telephone industry," he said. "This is something thatcan't come from the top down. It has to come up from the bottomroots of the industry."I don't see Internet telephones replacing normal phones, butacting as an adjunct to them."Right now, interoperability and the fact that relatively fewpeople are hard-wired into the Internet, are the biggest factorsholding back the technology.But all it takes is time, he said, adding, "give it a coupleyears. It's just a matter of cranking out the software".Internet telephones will provide much more flexibility because ofthe lack of regulatory controls and standards existing on today'slong-distance carriers."You can't even do something as simple as split the cost of aphone call," Green pointed out.Internet phones are a good use of the bandwidth using only aboutone-sixth of the carrier. Internet packet-switched signals travelat about 10,000bps as opposed to the 64,000bps required fornormal connection-switched voice calls.NetPhone software, which Green developed with his partner, DeniseMeyers, runs only on Macintosh LC II computers or better with800Kb of memory available.System requirements also include a microphone and a serial-lineInternet protocol (SLID) or a point-to-point protocol (PTP)Internet connection.NetPhone uses Electric Magic Company's own audio compressionalgorithm which compresses the voice bandwidth to 10,000bps overthe Internet.The software is available for demo review over Info-Mac and itsUK mirror site. NetPhone is available for purchase at $55 for onecopy and $85 for two.VocalTec Inc, based in Tel Aviv, IsrAel, and NorthVale, NewJersey, announced the Internet Phone last month. the softwareallows a TCP/IPconnection to carry an international telephonecall via the Internet at the cost of a connection to a localInternet provider at local prices.VocalTec is offering the software at $50 with plans to double theprice when the company's trial period finishes in April.

Already a powerhouse in electronicsmanufacturing, Singapore seems destined to emerge as an important stopon the information superhighway.According to the World Competitiveness Report, which ranks theeconomic strength of countries across eight categories, Singaporeranked first in telecommunications infrastructure, largely because allof Singapore's telephones are digital, and all of its telephoneexchanges are linked through optical fiber. All Singapore homes areexpected to be connected to fiber-optic cable by the year 2005. Inaddition, about 99 percent of the Singapore population owns colortelevisions; 84 percent own video cassette recorders; and four percentown video laser-disc players.And Singapore has also just launched a video-on-demand trial using ATMand a Hewlett-Packard video server that will bring it firmly into the21st Century. Initially, the system will cater to 300 households, ofwhich 20 will be completed in third quarter 1995 (first phase) and theremaining 280 homes in fourth quarter 1995 (second phase). The totalcontract amount for the Project will amount to about $9 million.The HP ConnectionThe Singapore video-on-demand trial, which is being built and operatedby Singapore Telecom, will be using the same Hewlett-PackardMediaStream Server video servers that are being used by PacificTelesis, BellSouth and SNET in the U.S.Unlike some other video dialtone solutions, HP's MediaStream Servervideo server is designed explicitly for interactive video services.HP's video server is based on a new hardware architecture called the"video transfer engine," which HP says is built for moving vastquantities of video data across networks in a way that lowers the costof delivering each video stream to users. HP's video transfer enginetechnology is scalable and modular, allowing interactive-televisionproviders to add capabilities to each video server and to connectservers in a network as consumer and business demand forinteractive-television services grows. For example, a single HP videoserver can be scaled to deliver from 75 to 10,000 video streams, andwhen multiple servers are connected, millions of households andbusinesses could use the network to receive video-on-demand.Joining HP to provide technology and services for Singapore Telecom'svideo-on-demand trial are Mitsui & Co. Limited as the consortiumleader; Fujitsu Limited of Tokyo, which will be system integrator andsupplier of ATM switches and network technology; and Philips SingaporePte Limited of the Netherlands, which will supply settop boxes.Sybase in SingaporeThe other major vendor involved in the Singapore trial is Sybase, Inc.of Emeryville, Calif. HP will integrate Sybase's software to run onthe MediaStream Server product. Sybase's Intermedia architecturesoftware includes three products:- Intermedia Server for control and integration- Gain Momentum for multimedia authoring- Gain Interplay for settop box integration.The deal marks the company's first overseas agreement for Intermediaand follows on the heels of announcements that Sybase software hasbeen chosen by SNET and Cox Cable for their interactive televisiontrials. In Singapore, the Sybase software will be used to author,deliver and manage ITV applications and integrate these applicationswith Singapore Telecom's back-end subscriber and accounting systems.In addition to working with Singapore Telecom on the ITV trial, Sybaseis also providing the company with relational database managementsoftware to manage key business applications at Singapore Telecom,including the company's cellular billing system.The Intermedia products, in conjunction with video processor hardwareand settop boxes provide a complete environment for authoring,delivering, and managing interactive multimedia applications andservices. The Intermedia Server is based on Sybase's SQL Server RDBMStechnology and provides two critical components: control and messageintegration. The control component stores and manages informationabout multimedia data objects (such as names and locations of moviesor product descriptions). The message routing component providesrouting of requests to and from the various components (settop box,video server, and back-end business systems for billing andsubscriptions).Gain Momentum is an object-oriented multimedia authoring environment"for developing visual, intuitive, and entertaining applications." Inaddition, Gain Momentum can access and manipulate data from Sybase andother databases, allowing customers to integrate multimediaapplications with their existing and future business systems. GainInterplay is a software tool that allows interactive multimediaapplications to be played on low-cost, small-memory, hardware devicessuch as the television settop boxes and home personal computers thatwill be used to access a variety of multimedia offerings. The GainInterplay product will be available on a variety of settop boxes,including Phillips' CD-I, Scientific-Atlanta's PowerTV,Hewlett-Packard's Kayak, as well as on Windows-based personalcomputers.Content and BeyondThe Singapore video-on-demand trial is part of a broad governmentinitiative called "IT 2000." The goal of IT 2000 is to build astate-of-the-art, broadband communications infrastructure andsupporting services to further strengthen the competitiveness of theSingapore economy and to improve its residents' quality of life.Singapore Telecom's multimedia trial will offer a broad range ofcontent, including customized interactive news, home shopping,interactive learning for children and adults, documentaries, moviesand sports.Because the population is predominately English-speaking, SingaporeTelecom expects early programming for its interactive-televisionservice will be primarily in English.In the trial, Singapore Telecom will offer interactive services suchas movies-on-demand, interactive news and education, as well as homeshopping.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA NETWORKING NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1995Micropolis Announces AV Disk Drives Achieving 4 Mbytes per secondSustained Data RateMicropolis Corp.

The eventual system will, the companies said, manageinteraction among settop terminals, video servers, headends andoptical nodes on a real-time basis.As multiple services come on-line, the Level One Gateway software willcontrol the switch fabric much like a telephony central office switch.It will be a critical, 24-hour facility that must remain in continuousoperation while the network hardware, service definitions, and its ownsoftware evolve through experience. Unlike central office switches,however, the Level One Gateway will control a diverse distributedswitching system environment and support a variety of operator-definedcall models and applications."The architecture of the GI Level One Gateway will create an opensystem usable in a multi-vendor environment," said Robert Lund,director of network architectures and products for Probita. "It willaccommodate a wide range of subscribers on a variety of hardwareplatform configurations.

The PCI-based 21230 codec chip putsaffordable video authoring and video conferencing on a widerange of platforms based on Pentium, Alpha, and PowerPCmicroprocessors.Ed Caldwell, vice president, Digital Semiconductor, a DigitalEquipment Corporation business, said, "With the 21230 videochip, PC vendors can deliver affordable capability on thedesktop for creating and using video-enhanced presentations,interactive training, video conferencing, on-line monitoring,and other forms of multimedia communication."Video Compression EssentialSusan Yost, Digital Semiconductor's multimedia marketingmanager, called image compression/decompression "essential" toreduce the heavy data storage and bandwidth demands of videoapplications."Video authoring and video conferencing need a video codecthat not only compresses data efficiently, but delivershigh-quality video that accurately represents the originalmaterial. And they need it in real time," she said."The 21230 chip is the first video codec to meet thischallenge at an affordable price," Yost continued. "The 21230video chip implements state-of-the-art compression andfiltering techniques that provide efficient data compression,exceptional image quality, and realtime performance.

Thomson Consumer Electronics has a considerable edge, basedon the company's product positioning revealed at the recent 1996Winter Consumer Electronics Show.      The company expects to deliver product in late summer, likelybefore any other vendor.  On the manufacturing side, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.Ltd. will make DVD players for Thomson throughout 1996.  In exchange,Thomson plans to manufacture digital satellite systems Matsushita willsell under the Panasonic brand.  In 1997, Thomson will manufacture DVDplayers and Matsushita will produce DSS systems.              "We're putting the band back together," said Joseph Clayton,Thomson executive vice president for marketing and sales, referring tothe OEM agreement the company struck with Matsushita in 1970 in theVCR category.        Thomson today commands roughly a 20 percent share in VCRs andis aiming even higher with DVD.      "What other company has three brands as powerful as RCA,ProScan and GE?" said Guy Johnson, Thomson vice president for videoand multimedia.  "Nobody even comes close." Clayton's company will combine the manufacturing capabilities ofMatsushita with Thomson's worldwide presence, under such brand namesas Telefunken in Germany, Thomson in France and Saba throughoutEurope, for the DVD launch.  Such a massive product rollout translatesinto economies of scale, which will mean a price advantage at retail.       At press time, only two companies had announced DVD hardwarepricing.  Thomson plans to sell its basic model for $499, and ToshibaAmerica Consumer Products Inc. will bring in its entry-level model at$599.        To let consumers know DVD is a technology that will notbecome outdated anytime soon, Thomson is relying on alliances andcross-promotions with content providers, namely Warner Home Video. Warner will release software titles concurrently for DVD and VHS.  Thecompany also plans to deliver the movies and properties already out onVHS in DVD format.      But Warner is not relying solely on Thomson to grow the DVDsoftware market.  The firm plans to co-market with Toshiba as well.   "We will co-promote with several hardware companies," said WarrenLieberfarb, Warner Home Video president.  Lieberfarb described hismodus operandi as "counterintuitive" but said Warner "holds severalhardware co-patents on DVD components with Toshiba."        Toshiba executives promise to deliver hardware to retailprior to Labor Day.  Sony Corp., which will sell DVD hardware initially this fall, isramping up DVD software efforts.  Columbia/Tri-Star Home Video willrelease 150 movies for DVD and plans to have 50 DVD titles availableto coincide with the hardware's launch.  Certain retailers who carrySony hardware also will sell the software.       In the marketing arena, Thomson has a decided advantage overToshiba, a company that promises to be among the top three share-holders of DVD.

"This is by far the single biggest ramp we've had in the Pentiumhistory," said Joanne Hasegawa, a spokeswoman for the company.  "Weexpect to see systems right off the bat."   Typically it takes Intel several months to produce enough newprocessors to  fill demand, but PC manufacturers that spoke withMultimedia Week Editor Judith Abrams said they expect an ample supplyof the new chips.  NEC Technologies Inc. last week made its 150 MHz Pentium Ready9552 available.    Other vendors Intel is supplying with its first 150 MHz and 166MHz Pentium chips in quantities initially include Gateway 2000, IBM andHewlett-Packard Co..  IBM's 166 MHz unit is available.

But do not look forany major changes on the multimedia landscape before the second half ofthe year.  Multimedia Week Editor Judith Abrams spoke with several keymanufacturers and industry analysts to find out what trends andtechnologies vendors should prepare to capitalize on this year.  Here iswhat they had to say:      ...When Will the 3-D Market Explode?  The most visible enhancement expected in the software and chipbusinesses will come in the form of 3-D games.  "We see 3D permeating the graphics world, offering a slew offeatures and performance that just aren't available today," said KenWirt, vice president of marketing, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.  "Bythe end of the year, you'll probably see a significant number of PCsystems come 3-D enabled."  Wirt said at least 10 new 3-D companies entered the market lastyear.  What could slow the trend toward better graphics?  Insufficientsoftware.  Experts involved with the technology disagree about when it willhit the market in full force.  "There'll be enough titles in the second half, say the September toOctober time frame, that 3D is going to be a mainstream part of themarket," said Murali Dharan, vice president of marketing for consumerPCs, NEC Technologies Inc.  "You'll see a few hit titles, and that's allthat'll be required.  People have bought Sony PlayStation and Sega basedon much less."  Barry Lebu, president and CEO of Jazz Multimedia Inc., is even morebullish on 3D.  "It's really going to explode," he said.  "You'll probably see twodozen titles out there in the next 90 days."      ...More Functions, Fewer Chips  Look for more consolidation in the chip industry, with companiesattempting to buy each other and integrate several functions onto asingle chip.  "People who have had strong markets in one area [audio, video orcommunications], are going to try to expand," NEC's Dharan said.  "Iwouldn't be surprised if S3 went out and bought some other companies. You might also see an established company (be it a single chip firm orcompany that manufactures multi-functional chips) go out and gobble up aspecialty chip company."  The current trend is to combine 2-D, 3-D and digital video, butmore functions could be on the way.  "There are some rumblings about communications," Wirt said. "There's a couple guys saying they are going to combine all this withDSP."  Such a move, however, requires keen timing and a heavy R&Dinvestment.  "Video, audio and communications are three separate disciplines,and you're competing against companies that all they do is one thing,"Wirt said, adding that "development cycles aren't synched up exactly."     Whether these new chip designs make it to the motherboard isanother question.  Intel Corp. is expected to deliver its MMX initiative, anenhancement of its next-generation processor with multimedia extensions,sometime in 1996.  "I don't think it will be ready until the second half of 1996,"said Richard Chang, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co.   ...Cable Modems On Hold  Cable modems are expected to impact the CD-ROM as a means ofdelivering content, but they will not threaten the disc business in1996.  "The idea of delivering the kind of graphics we build into a gamethrough the Net and high-speed modems is at the moment a fairy tale,"said Ben Tenn, vice president of marketing for Activision Inc.  "It cantake you two days to download the video we put on a couple of CDs."  Others agree.  Diamond's Wirt forecasts 1996 as a year in which transmissioncompanies will begin work on new services.  But delivering service isanother story.  "Anything beyond analog modems requires either the cable companiesor the telephone guys to upgrade their systems in some way," he said. "I don't think anything like that is going to happen widespread in1996."  ...Improved Communications Means Content Enhancements  Expect more advances on the Internet and in other kinds of modemtechnology.  More PC manufacturers are expected to add digitalsimultaneous voice and data modems (DSVD) to their products.  Many vendors added high-end modems to their top PC models in 1995,but the  technology is far from mainstream.  "That's likely to happen in the second half [of 96]," said NEC'sDharan.  As a result, consumers will be able to do more things with theirPCs.  For example, they might use the technology to peruse informationabout airline flights and make a reservation at the same time.  Activision, and several other publishers, plan to leverage modemtechnology to make better use of the Internet.  In the company'supcoming title Spycraft, users will get information fed to them from thecompany's Web site.  "We'll be able to deliver extra levels, but the core game engineand the graphics have got to be delivered on a CD-ROM," said Tenn.  ...Budgets Grow, But Prices Continue to Fall  Activision spends about $2.5 million to $3 million on developmentper title, and company vice president Tenn sees that number rising.    "This business requires deeper marketing dollars and greater andgrander tools," he said.  Despite budget increases, CD-ROM prices are coming down.  "Everybody's very concerned about the lower-end price points," saidRobert Peterson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc.  "The average pricewill go down because of the growth in the budget category.  It's goingto continue to sell."  Activision's Tenn is not too concerned that the low-end titles willbring down the prices of big-budget titles.  "What you'll see is the back catalog will be priced down at $19 and$20," he said.  "The consumer will continue to pay top dollar for thetop games."  ..And on the Desktop Front  Multimedia PC manufacturers are expected to continue to dropprices, but a high-end, niche category that emerged in late 1995 willcontinue.  "There is a market for higher-end, upscale game machines that werepopular during Christmas," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst withInternational Data Corp.  "We will see more focus on the $1,500 pricepoints, but manufacturers will try to keep them up and refresh features.  And what are those features?  By third quarter, 6x and 8x speed CD-ROM drives will becomestandard features on PCs, along with 28.8 Kbps modems and 16 MB of RAM. Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996PACKARD BELL'S FORAY INTO SOFTWARE IS TOO BIG A STRETCH, `DOOMED TOFAILURE'       Packard Bell Electronics Inc. is attempting to extend its brandname into the CD-ROM business, but industry watchers are skeptical abouthow much clout the firm will carry with software buyers.  The company launched its Active Imagination software brand lastFebruary as a pilot program, but is ramping up a grander CD-ROM effortwith updated packaging, a new distributions strategy and a new name--Packard Bell Interactive.    The division's leaders believe it can rely on the operationsstrength of its parent company for administrative, shipping and otherfunctions involved with selling software.  "That gives us the opportunity to start this company with far lessrevenue than a new startup would need," said Glenn Uslan, vice presidentof corporate marketing.  Analysts are skeptical.   "I think if they're going to try for synergies it's doomed tofailure," said Lee Isgur, an analyst with Jeffries & Co. Inc.  "There isno evidence that a hardware brand has any impact on the success of thesoftware brand."  Key industry players agree with Isgur.  "Rarely, if ever, has a hardware company truly understoodsoftware," said Ben Tenn, vice president of sales for Activision Inc.  An executive who got his start selling hardware for Panasonic, Tennpointed out that industry heavyweights Matsushita and Sony have not beenable to translate their hardware expertise into the content arena.  "Andthat's on a grand scale with enormous talent and resources," Tenn said.   But Packard Bell executives believe they can make the transition.  "Our software will be available to all Packard Bell retailers thisquarter," said Uslan.   For the past six months, the company has bundled a two-for-onesoftware coupon inside its hardware to encourage customers to buy ActiveImagination software at retail.  "By bringing the customer back in to buy more, we have a directcontact with 3 to 4 million customers a year," Uslan said.    On the content side, Packard Bell is outsourcing title developmentand focusing on the children's education market.  Four new CD-ROMs areexpected at retail in the next few weeks.    Rose Studios Inc. of Redmond, Wash., developed Little Red RidingHood and Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  Australian-based BrilliantInteractive Ideas Pty Ltd. developed Monster on the Loose and Dinosaurin the Garden.  Later this quarter, the company plans to bundle a copy of theYuckadoos, which hit retail last year under the Active Imaginationlabel, with every Packard Bell Interactive title.  "We're hoping to sell 25,000 to 30,000 units in the first quarterand give away that many," Uslan said.  To aid the initiative, Packard Bell hired John Rutter, a formermarketing manager with Microsoft Corp., and Steve Boehm, who previouslyheld positions with Medio Multimedia and My Software Company.

In an apparent bid to upstage the much-anticipated debut nextmonth of the Nintendo 64 and its Super Mario 64 title, Sega of Americais launching an $8.5 million marketing campaign to promote its SegaSaturn title, NiGHTS. ($49.99).  The title--which will debut on August20--will come less than six weeks before Nintendo's debut on Sept. 30. "There's no question [Nintendo 64] will be a dominant voice in theholiday period," Anne Moellering, Sega of America's marketing manager,told MMWIRE.  "We're clearly aware of that," Moellering added.  About80 percent of Sega's marketing budget will be devoted to TVadvertisements for NiGHTS on ABC, NBC, and other channels.  Moelleringadded that it was a "coincidence" that Sega was debuting NiGHTS soclose to the Nintendo 64's debut.  Sales of the Nintendo 64 in Japanhave exceeded expectations thus far, and most analysts predict thatthe 500,000 units Nintendo expects to ship in the United States thisyear will sell out.

Theseterritories together represent almost two thirds of the world'ssoundcarrier market.However, apart from the decline of the MC format in all territories andthe recovery of the sale of singles outside the US, no overall patternemerges for the US, Japan, Germany and the UK. Japan and the UKexperienced double digit growth over the year, but there was littlegrowth in either the US or Germany. The table below shows Music &Copyright's estimated individual growth rates for the world's top foursoundcarrier markets plus a combined growth rate for all fourterritories weighted to account for the relative size of each market.In 1994 there was a 16.5% increase in value of the world soundcarriermarket, according to record industry trade association IFPI. In the 30national markets which represented over 90% of global soundcarriersales this fell to 14% in the first half of 1995 (see M&C 76/3). Themajor cause of this was a decline in the growth of CD unit sales whichslowed down from 25% in 1994 to 19% for the first six months of 1995.This decline continued into the second half of 1995.According to US trade paper Billboard, SoundScan, which collects salesdata from music retailers, reported that 409.5m CDs and 245.7m MCs weresold in the US in 1995. This represented a rise of 11.2% in CD salesfrom 1994 and a 16.2% drop in MC sales.Bearing in mind the higher price of CDs, in value terms, these figuresmean that the US market has hardly had any growth. Although the unitfigures of SoundScan and the US trade association RIAA are verydifferent, because one tracks sales and the other trade shipments,their percentage figures for growth and decline have generally beenclose.Certainly SoundScan's percentage changes are close to the tradeshipments reported by the RIAA for the first half of 1995, which wereplus 13% for CDs and minus 15% for MCs. These contrast dramaticallywith 1994 when the RIAA reported a 34% growth in CD trade shipments anda 2% growth in MC shipments.Moreover, US soundcarrier sales over the Christmas period,traditionally the biggest sales period of the year, were flat.According to SoundScan, unit sales were down 0.03% in December 1995compared to the same period in 1994 and the growth rate for CD sales at12.4% was lower than for the year as a whole. The International Councilof Shopping Centers, which tracks sales at 400 regional malls in theUS, reported that music and related home entertainment sales were down0.3% on Christmas 1994 in contrast to a 4.7% rise in mall salesgenerally.Accordingly, most observers are predicting minimal growth in the valueof the US soundcarrier market in 1995. Some even predict that totalsoundcarrier revenues will hardly top 1994's $11.84bn. They give twomain reasons: poor sales by superstar albums and increased competitionfrom computer software.Although Hootie and the Blowfish sold an unprecedented 11m units oftheir debut album Cracked View Mirror in the US, as a whole there werefewer big-selling albums there in 1995 than in 1994. Only 278 albumssold over 500,000 units each, compared with 340 titles in 1994. Amongthe top acts whose albums did not meet expectations were Elton John,Rod Stewart, Paula Abdul, the Rolling Stones, Bonnie Raitt and MichaelJackson, whose HIStory only sold 2m units in the US.In addition, video and computer games now compete for the dollars thatwere traditionally spent on music. In the first half of 1995 softwaresales grew by 12% (compared with 8% for soundcarriers) and in the lastquarter of 1995 several computer chains reported an average 40%increase in sales of personal computers, with 30 of the US' 64 majorcomputer retailers reporting better than expected sales. Only 11reported sales below expectations.Soundcarrier sales in Japan totalled $5.43bn in 1994. Whereas there was20% growth in the US soundcarrier market in 1994, sales grew by only 1%in Japan that year. But sales of music in Japan grew by at least 10% in1995. Western compilations were increasingly successful in Japan in1995 (see M&C 79/3). CD titles of international repertoire manufacturedinside the country in the first 11 months of the year represented 39%of the market, or 95.2m units. Shipments of international repertoiregrew by 19%, compared to 8% growth for domestic repertoire. However,figures compiled by the Japanese trade association RIAJ, which show an11% growth rate by value in the year to November, may underestimate thesituation. They do not include albums imported by Western-ownedretailers (such as Tower) and Japanese record companies, whichincreased greatly in 1995. In the first six months CD imports rose 24%by value to $193.4m and 40% by units to 32.7m (see M&C 74/6). Sales ofsingles in Japan have also continued to rise. In the first 11 months of1995 sales grew 22% in units and 18% in value.Earlier in the year, observers predicted that Germany, which posted 3%growth in value in 1994 and 12% growth in the first six months of 1995according to IFPI, would have a 6% plus growth rate for 1995. However,in the light of a disappointing summer, poor Christmas sales and fewermajor releases than expected, most have revised this figure downward.The most dramatic fall in growth was of CD shipments, which fell to 7%for the first nine months of 1995 after being in double figuresthroughout the 1990s. In view of this and the 15% fall in MC shipments,Music & Copyright estimates that in value terms the German soundcarriermarket will grow at between 1% and 2%. Taking account of inflation,this figure represents hardly any growth at all in real terms (seestory on page 8 for more detail on the German soundcarrier market).Huge Christmas sales, the continued revival of the singles market andthe Britpop phenomenon, which had a noticeable effect on album sales inthe second half of the year, combined to create double digit growth forthe UK soundcarrier market in 1995. Most observers predict the UKmarket will grow by more in 1995 than the 17.4% increase seen in 1994and the 18% growth reported for the first six months of 1995.UK sales in the fourth quarter alone were over 20% higher than in thesame period of 1994. Almost 50m albums were sold, with just under 15msold in the two week Christmas holiday period. Of these sales some 2m(or 4%) were accounted for by Robson & Jerome's eponymous debut album.This was in addition to the sales of 2.8m copies of the duo's first twosingles. The Britpop effect can be seen in the Top 100 selling singlesof the year. In 1994, 39 of these were by British acts; in 1995, 49,the highest ever number in the 1990s since 1991.SOUNDCARRIER SALES IN SELECTED TERRITORIES IN 1995 ($BN)Germany      Japan         UK           US           Total2.93 (+2)    6.64 (+12)    2.78 (+19)   12.00 (+1)   24.36 (+6)The figures in brackets are the percentage changes on 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996SHORTAGE OF SUPERSTARS BRINGS DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICAN CONCERT GROSSESThe value of concert tickets sold in North America fell by almost 33%in 1995 to $950m, according to trade paper Pollstar. Nonetheless,ticket sales in 1995 were the third largest in the history of the USand Canadian concert industry. The top 50 grossing tours accounted for78% of the total with combined ticket sales of $742.7m.The two significant trends of 1995 were the decline in the number ofsuperstars touring and the emergence of a number of new headline acts.In 1994 the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd together took $225m, whichwas just over 16% of the $1.4bn raised by ticket sales in that year. In1994-1995 the Eagles, whose Hell Freezes Over was the most successfulreunion tour ever, grossed $142.7m in total, of which $63.3m was earnedin 1995, representing almost 7% of the year's ticket sales.However, few other superstar acts toured apart from R.E.M., Boyz IIMen, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page and the Grateful Dead. The Deadcancelled their autumn tour following the death of group leader JerryGarcia and have since said they will no longer perform live.Among the new acts who toured successfully were Hootie and theBlowfish, who translated the 11m sales of their debut album CrackedView Mirror into $8.8m in concert ticket sales. Other new acts whichgrossed high figures on tour included the Dave Matthews Band ($9m from130 shows), Jodeci and Mary J. Blige ($7.7m from 30 shows) and Phish($15.7m from 79 shows). In the country field, Mary Chapin Carpenter andJohn Michael Montgomery had large-grossing tours for the first time.Several acts earned more from touring than their record sales mighthave suggested. Among these were Page/Plant ($33.4m), Tom Petty and theHeartbreakers ($27.5m) and Elton John ($22.5m). More in line with theirrecord sales were the touring revenues of two country acts, RebaMcIntire ($27.4m) and George Strait ($15.2m). Strait's 49-show tourhelped his MCA box-set sell far better than expected.Another reason for the decline in 1995 concert revenues was that actstended to play smaller venues. Whereas in 1994 three football stadiumsshared first place for mounting the biggest shows, no football stadiumswere among the leading venues of 1995. Similarly, whereas 17 concertsgrossed over $5m in 1994, none did in 1995.However, as the table below shows, if 1994's exceptional figures areexcluded, the 1995 figures show a modest return to growth. Thismoderate increase in ticket receipts is expected to continue into 1996.U2 looks set to be the biggest tour of 1996, (although the group hasnot yet announced dates). The Rolling Stones and the Eagles areexpected to continue their ongoing tours, but not in North America.Bruce Springsteen's solo acoustic tour will probably include as manybars as concert halls and accordingly will not be among the year'slargest grossing tours.NORTH AMERICAN TOP TEN GROSSING TOURS OF ALL TIMERank/Artist                     Year      Gross ($m)1  Rolling Stones               1994        121.22  Pink Floyd                   1994        103.53  Rolling Stones               1989         98.04  Eagles                       1994         79.45  New Kids on the Block        1990         74.16  U2                           1992         67.07  Eagles                       1995         63.38  Barbra Streisand             1994         58.99  Grateful Dead                1994         52.410 Elton John/Billy Joel        1994         47.8NORTH AMERICA; TOP 50 TOUR RECEIPTS, 1990 - 1995 ($M)1990   1991        1992        1993        1994          1995448.0  578.6 (+29) 712.1 (+23) 634.0 (-11) 1,022.0 (+61) 742.7 (-27)The figures in brackets are the percentage changes on the previousyear.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996EMI MUSIC WINS RIGHTS TO LIFE FOR MRSEUK Mechanical Collection Society MCPS has accepted EMI Music's claimthat the 10 works on Simply Red's Life album were not registered withMCPS. This acceptance was reached at an MCPS board meeting beforeChristmas and frees EMI Music to collect the phono-mechanical rightsdue from Life directly from Simply Red's record company Warner MusicEurope. EMI Music intends to do this through Mechanical Rights SocietyEurope (MRSE), a collection society it specifically set up for thispurpose (see M&C 80/5).EMI says it wants to do this because of excessive delays in receivingmonies through the GEMA-Warner Music Europe central licensing deal andthe high rebate GEMA gives Warner. Prior to this, GEMA argued that theworks had entered the European copyright system through MCPS and thatEMI Music could not withdraw them. GEMA has now written to EMI Musicsaying it accepts that the phono-mechanical rights in the works areregistered with MRSE.Music & Copyright understands that EMI still intends to divide themechanical rights in the works between MRSE (phono-mechanical rights)and MCPS (non phono-mechanical mechanical rights) which it expects GEMAto collect on its behalf (see M&C 78/5). In response to the argumentthat this will inevitably drive up the costs of rights collection,because the revenues (roughly 20% of mechanical revenues) are morecostly to collect than phono-mechanicals, EMI points out that highercommission rates for the various mechanical rights are already inplace. GEMA's response to this is as yet unknown.However, there is growing evidence that despite having set up MRSE,which had its inaugural board meeting two weeks ago, EMI is moreconcerned to get GEMA to reduce its rebate and speed up payment than tomake extensive use of MRSE.Music & Copyright understands that these were the main topics discussedat a meeting between EMI Music and GEMA, the first between the leadingexecutives of both organisations, at London's Heathrow airport lastweek. Although EMI Music says it has other projects that it isconsidering putting through MRSE, including at least one act thatrecords for EMI Records, it seems far more interested in resolving theproblem within the existing operating structure of the Europeancollecting societies. A further meeting between GEMA and EMI Music isscheduled to take place at MIDEM on January 22.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996ITALIAN ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING FALLS 4%Spending on entertainment in Italy in the first six months of 1995 fell4.3% in real terms to L2,164bn ($1.37bn), according to Italian authors'rights society SIAE. Because SIAE collects entertainment taxes onbehalf of the Italian government it is well placed to see changes anddevelopments in the amount of money spent on entertainment in Italy.According to SIAE, for the first half of 1995 attendances at pop musicconcerts and popular arts events rose 16% to 2.9m, although the totalnumber of events was almost unchanged at 8,300. Receipts rose 16.6% to$40m and average ticket prices rose by 0.6% to $13.75. Receipts fromclassical music concerts over the six month period rose 9.3% to $22.2m,mostly because of higher ticket prices which rose to an average $10.75each. Unit ticket sales only rose by 0.7% to 2.1m for 9,000 concerts, asimilar number to the first half of 1993.There were 1,000 fewer cinema screenings over the period: down from285,000 to 284,000. Ticket sale receipts dropped by 2.9% to $240m andthe number of cinema-goers fell by 7.1% to 44.3m. Average cinema ticketprices rose from $5.18 to $5.42. Theatre fared better than most formsof entertainment. Box office receipts totalled $105m, a 10.5% increase.Average ticket prices rose by 3.5% to $11.40.Spending on sport dropped by 7% to $229.5m, SIAE said, althoughreceipts rose by 4.6% to $141m. Over the six months a total of 7.1mtickets were sold for top class football matches, an increase of 1.1%over January-June 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996U2-PRS CASE NEAR SETTLEMENTIrish group U2 has won at least part of its battle with Europeancollection societies to reduce the deductions made from performanceroyalties and the speed of payment. French authors' society SACEM hasreached an agreement in principle with the group and its publishers.SACEM has agreed to reduce its administration costs and the culturaldeductions it makes and to pay performance revenues within 28 days.U2 issued a writ against UK authors' society PRS in February 1994 aftera two year dispute with the society over the methods of collecting anddistributing public performance royalties for songs performed on large-scale international tours (see M&C 35/2). Music & Copyright estimatesthe gross performance royalties earned by U2 on its 1992-1993 Europeantour at a little over $1m. U2 said it received less than 50% of thisand wanted to establish a system whereby the group itself collected themoney, which is calculated as a percentage of gate receipts. When PRSrefused to give the group back its performance rights U2 issued a writdemanding their return. Nine European collecting societies were co-joined to the writ in June 1994 (see M&C 44/1). This was because thegroup needed the return of rights from each national society in orderto negotiate fees with individual promoters in Europe.As a result of the agreement with SACEM, the French society will bedropped from the writ. If, as is expected, it is followed by similaragreements with other continental societies, they too will be droppedfrom the writ. However, before these agreements can be made, U2 and PRSmust formalise their arrangements. The two have resumed talks after aconsiderable time and an announcement of a resolution of the matter isexpected at the MIDEM trade fair later this month.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996UK COPYRIGHT GOES TO 70 YEARS PMAThe harmonisation of copyright legislation within Europe came a stepcloser January 1 with the adoption in the UK of a law meeting theEuropean Union (EU) directive of October 29 1993 on the issue. Memberstates had officially been required to bring the directive into forceby July 1 1995. The most dramatic effect of the harmonisation in the UKis to end the disparity whereby copyright ended 50 years after theauthor's death, 20 years less than the EU term. The law applies to allcomposers from European Economic Area states, Austria, Belgium,Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Iceland, Ireland,Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden andthe UK.Publishers contacted by Music & Copyright had not seen the bill, whichwas only finally published last week, so several key points, which theEU directive left up to individual member states to decide, were stillunknown. A key issue is whether or not the bill stipulates reciprocitywith other non EEA countries, which would especially affect US authors.The UK authors' society PRS thought an immediate rise in licensingincome unlikely since it issues blanket licenses to venues andbroadcasters. However some classical venues may now have to apply for alicence. This would create extra income.Publishers say that renegotiation of fees will have to take place withbroadcasters since some, notably Classic FM radio, currently pay PRS alow fee because much or most of their output is out of copyright. Amongcomposers coming back into copyright will be Elgar, Holst and ArthurSullivan.Among issues PRS would like to see clarified are third party rights,for example the rights of the arrangers of works now returning tocopyright protection. Also at issue is how revenues will now becollected globally, particularly from US collection societies, sincemost US protection is for less than 70 years. Mechanical rights societyMCPS has provided members with notes to ascertain whether works arecovered by the EEA term or whether they revert to country of origin.Identifying the works that have gone out of copyright will createinitial costs. Moreover UK publishers feel that, at first, the newlegislation will lead to only a small increase in their revenues.However, they expect to eventually see a considerable increase inincome, both from copyright material coming back into copyright andfrom existing copyright material, which will earn money for longer.France is now the only main European market which has not introduced anew law to comply with the directive. French authors' society SACEMsays legislation was not presented to parliament in time for January 1and is scheduled to be enacted in the spring. French law has affordedauthors of musical works 70 years protection and neighbouring rights'holders 50 years protection since January 1 1986. For several months ithas been remitting funds to European collection societies in other EUstates on a national basis. SACEM says that this was done after theOctober 1993 Phil Collins ruling.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996CHINA CLOSES SIX PIRATE CD FACTORIESInternational record industry body IFPI has won two important successesin the fight against piracy in China. Five CD plants have been closedin south China and the trading licence of a further plant has beenwithdrawn by the authorities. In a separate action, IFPI and 23 memberswere awarded $800,000 in damages by a court in Shanghai, China. Thecourt declared that in 1993 Taiwanese Shi Hua-Lek had illegallyproduced over 95,000 copies of 31 albums containing 306 soundrecordings. Shi was also fined $43,000, ordered to pay costs and payfor a public apology in China Daily.The fine is huge by Chinese standards, but nonetheless IFPI was onlyawarded damages. In Taiwan following a successful High Court appeal Shiwas sentenced to one year's imprisonment. No criminal case has yet tobe brought against a copyright infringer in China, which with sales of256m pirate units is the largest pirate market in the world.The Chinese authorities have been generally more willing to bring civilcases to court than to try to stop pirate production at source. Fromthis perspective the steps taken by the authorities in Hainan andGuangdon provinces late in December are highly significant. Theyordered the stoppage of production at four CD plants - the ZhuhaiJiwellian CD Production Company, the Chazhou Xinle Laser Disc Company,the Chailing Sound Production Company and the Hainan Anmei LaserProduction Company - which were manufacturing pirate CDs, CD-ROMs andpornographic video-CDs. They also withdrew another plant's tradinglicence after complaints by IFPI and seized moulds and pressingequipment from a sixth plant, whose senior management was alsoarrested.All six plants are currently under investigation and IFPI is reasonablyconfident that within a month further plants will be identified as thesource of pirate and pornographic CDs and CD-derivatives. Despite thisaction, IFPI has made no moves to re-open its office in Canton which itclosed after death threats against its staff (see M&C 80/4).In a further move, China's State Copyright Bureau and Press andPublication Administration issued a circular on December 7 requiringthat two inspectors from the State Copyright office be based at all 270registered manufacturing plants of audio and visual products from thebeginning of 1996. The inspectors will check that a SourceIdentification Code is present on all CDs pressed and that TitleVerification has been established. They will be paid from localgovernment funds and will be barred from receiving gifts in money or inkind from the factories at which they are based. The move was welcomedby US officials at a meeting on December 20.In addition, a new consumer law in China is having some effect againstpiracy. Under the terms of the law customers can return fake and pirategoods to stores where they were bought and get back double the moneythey paid if the store cannot prove the items are genuine. In turn thestore can get double what it paid from its supplier, which in turn canget double what it paid the manufacturer. US trade officials havewelcomed the law, although they point out that it is less useful indealing with copyright piracy than with piracy of high fashion items.These moves come just before the anniversary of the Memorandum ofUnderstanding, signed last February between China and the US, which setout a detailed timetable for China to introduce measures ofintellectual copyright protection. But, since signing the Memorandum,China has made no significant progress in intellectual propertyprotection. New talks between the US and Chinese authorities are duesoon.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996TOP 25 GROSSING NORTH AMERICAN TOURS IN 1995Rk Artist           Gross   Average  Cities/                    ($m)  Gross ($)  Shows   Booking Agency1  The Eagles       63.3  1,376,087  46/58   William Morris Agency2  Boyz II Men      43.2    324,812  133/134 Intl Creative Mngnt3  R.E.M.           38.7    614,285  63/81   Progressive Global Agy4  Grateful Dead    33.5  1,675,631  20/45   Grateful Dead Prods5  Jimmy Page/      33.4    595,773  38/47   Robert Plant                              Itnl Creative Mngnt6  Van Halen        32.7    351,004  34/26   Premier Talent Agency7  Tom Petty & the   Heartbreakers    27.5    344,126  80/89   Premier Talent Agency8  Reba McIntire    27.4    301,098  91/101  Starstruck Talent9  Elton John       22.5    833,695  27/81   Howard Rose Agency10 Elton John/   Billy Joel       22.0  2,205,204  10/12   Howard Rose/QBC11 Alan Jackson     20.6    217,266  95/97   Chief Talent12 Jimmy Buffett    19.9    537,837  37/82   Howard Rose Agency13 Yanni            18.2    364,461  50/59   Monterey Peninsula Art14 Vince Gill       16.1    196,360  82/90   William Morris Agency15 Phish            15.7    233,713  67/89   Monterey Peninsula Art16 Brooks & Dunn    15.2    120,338  59/60   William Morris Agency17 George Strait    15.2    262,875  24/24   Erv Woolsey Company18 Live             13.4    169,360  79/81   Artists & Audience19 Lollapalooza '95 12.8    495,422  26/29   Williams Morris Agency20 Amy Grant        10.7    161,062  79/80   Creative Artists Agency21 Bon Jovi         10.5    269,230  39/42   Creative Artists Agency22 Allman Brothers   Band             10.2    189,176  54/63   Intl Creative Mngnt23 David Bowie/   Nine Inch Nails  10.1    404,867  25/27   Artists & Audience24 Eric Clapton     10.0    592,605  17/20   Creative Artists Agy25 Alabama           9.9    154,184  64/87   Dale Morris & AssocBack to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996EUROPEAN CHART SHARES, SINGLES, 1994-1995                  1994           1995BMG               14.1           15.5EMI               13.9           16.1PolyGram          24.0           20.7Sony              14.8           14.6Warner             9.8           10.0Others            23.4           23.1EUROPEAN CHART SHARES, ALBUMS, 1994 - 1995                  1994            1995BMG               14.1             9.8EMI               13.9            17.7PolyGram          24.0            25.0Sony              14.8            18.0Warner             9.8            15.8Others            23.4            13.7Commentary: PolyGram was the market leader in both album and singleschart shares in Europe in 1995, according to European trade paper Music& Media. The table above shows that PolyGram had a 20.7% share of Music& Media's European Top 100 album charts and a 25% share of itsEurochart Hot 100 singles chart.PolyGram's success came despite the fact that its most successful albumlabel, Mercury, was only the fourth most successful with a 4.9% chartshare. The most successful labels were Columbia (8.1%), EMI (5.15%) andVirgin (4.9%). Similarly PolyGram's most successful single label, A&M,was only the ninth most successful label with a 2.5% share. The leadingsingles labels were Virgin (5%), RCA (3.8%) and Iceberg (3.5%).PolyGram's most successful album acts were The Cranberries, whoseIsland album No Need To Argue accounted for 4.2% of the company's chartshare, and Bon Jovi whose Mercury album Cross Road was the third bestselling album in Europe. The greatest successes of second place Sonywere Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, French singingFrancis Cabrel and Michael Jackson. Because the figures are onlycalculated from the first 48 weeks of the year, third-placed EMI'sshare does not include most of the chart points due from The BeatlesAnthology and Queen's Made In Heaven. If they were included EMI wouldprobably be in second place. The company's most successful acts werePink Floyd and Simple Minds.Sony had the most successful single of the year, Michael Jackson's YouAre Not Alone, but was only the fourth-placed company. Second toPolyGram was EMI with hits from Shaggy, Meat Loaf, The Connells andEdwyn Collins. Almost a third of the chart points of third-placed BMGcame from the two hit singles of Scatman John and Take That's Back ForGood.In 1994 a number of mainland European acts such as Eros Ramazzotti,Snap and Patrick Bruel had European-wide hits. In 1995 there were fewersuch acts. Only Danish-based Scatman John and the Dutch-based Rednexhad any significant European success.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996SOUNDCARRIER DELIVERIES, JANUARY-NOVEMBER, 1995Country      Singles (units m)   LPs (units m)   MCs (units m)Canada         0.4    (-22)        -     -       14.8  (-22)Japan        152.2    (+22)       0.5  (-9)      22.8  (-15)Country      CDs (units m)      Value ($m)Canada       43.1  (+18)        398.5  (+11)Japan       245.6  (+12)      4,927.2  (+11)The figures in brackets are the percentage changes on the correspondingperiod in the previous year.The value figure for Canada is wholesale; for Japan retail.Commentary: Shipments of all soundcarrier formats in Canada apart fromCDs were lower in November than in the same month of 1994.

For additional comment see story on page 1.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996SLOWER GROWTH IN 1995 FOR THE GERMAN SOUNDCARRIER MARKETAn unusually hot summer, a dearth of major releases and a disappointingChristmas depressed soundcarrier sales in Germany in 1995. Earlyindustry estimates of a 6% growth rate have been revised downwards tonearer 2% growth in value terms, but taking account of inflation, thisrepresents a stalling of the soundcarrier market in real terms. Totalrecord sales in 1994 were valued at DM5.68bn ($3.95bn). Of this 83%came from BPW affiliated companies, 8.5% from non-members, 6.5% fromdirect imports, and 2% from pirate product.Figures from BPW, the German record industry's trade association,showed a continued decline in cassette and vinyl sales and a 7%increase in CD sales for the first nine months of 1995 compared withthe same period in 1994. However, the increase in the number of CDssold is unlikely to translate into the same growth in value becausemany of the year's best selling albums were special offer compilations.Unit sales of MCs and vinyl LPs fell by 15.4% and 40% respectively inthe first three quarters of 1995, continuing the trend of the lastthree years. Growth in the singles market also slowed. Although salesof CD singles continued to grow, up 9.3% to 30.6m units in the firstnine months of the year, (compensating for the 41.7% decline in vinylsingle sales to 700,000 units over the same period), January-Septemberunit sales growth in singles was of 7.2%, compared with 15% in the sameperiod in 1994. Overall, soundcarrier unit growth to end September was3.2%. There was mounting industry concern that the CD singles marketwas growing at the expense of CD albums, since many CD singles containas many as six tracks. A maxi-single typically retails at just under $9compared with a long play format CD at around $21 or more.The Virgin-McDonald's CDsSoundcarrier sales in July and August were down 17% from the samemonths in 1994, blamed largely on the long hot spell, which affectedmost of Europe. Full 1995 sales figures have not yet been compiled byBPW, but after the summer lull sales fluctuated considerably. Septemberwas a good month, largely because of sales of the Virgin-produced RockSuperstars Vol. 1 compilation. This was marketed through McDonald'soutlets at just $6.92 and sold 2.7m units in Germany, Austria andSwitzerland. Sales in October were up 10% compared with the same monthof 1994, but then rose only 3% in November, despite key releases suchas the Beatles Anthology and new product from Queen and the KellyFamily.December saw the release of Rock Superstars Vol. 2, again marketedthrough McDonald's, this time with a $3.5m advertising campaign. The 14-track album sold virtually the same number of units as Vol. 1 at thesame price. Market research showed one in six buyers of the firstcompilation had never bought a soundcarrier before and that of thosefirst-time buyers, half made a second CD purchase before the end of theyear. World of Music, Germany's largest music retailer, reported alacklustre Christmas; December sales, which normally account for 18% ofannual turnover, were only 16% and only four albums were big sellers:Queen's Made in Heaven, Michael Jackson's HIStory, Beatles Anthologyand Pur's Abenteuerland. Sales of this last were 50% below Queen's.If, as expected, the final figures show that album market unit salesrose by 3% in unit terms to about 211m units in 1995, the two Virgincompilations will represent almost 2.4% of album sales overall andalmost 3% of all CD sales in the year, although less in value termsbecause of their low price. Other budget CDs also contributed to unitsales increases, according to IFPI members' reports of sales to clubsand dealers. Budget CD sales rose 22.3% in the first nine months of theyear, while full price CDs rose only 5.7%. Unusually, sales of mid-price CDs, which had a boom year in 1994, were down by 3.2%. Industryobservers blame discounting on full price CDs by retailers for this.There was big growth in sales of German-language repertoire in 1995.The country's November album chart showed an unprecedented seven albumsby German artists in the Top 10, and sales of domestic repertoire salesrose an estimated 11% to account for 40% of the market, a record high.Domestic repertoire achieved a 24% share of the year's Top 100 albumcharts, and a record 41.3% in the singles chart. Albums by Germanartists such as Pur, Die Doofen, Die Prinzen, Die Fantastichen, DieArtzte and Westernhagen all performed well.The continued growth of German repertoireConsumers and radio stations are abandoning their bias towards Anglo-American repertoire, say industry observers. This and the continuedstrength of the dance and Techno genres has also helped boost domesticrepertoire's share of the market - reflected most strongly in thesingles chart. The independents' share of the singles chart rose from16.8% in 1994 to 18.3% in 1995. The most successful independent wasdance label ZYX with a 10.2% share. Other successful independents wereedel (5.1%) EAMS (1.5%) and Semaphore (1%). The independents' share ofthe album charts also rose, from 8.9% in 1994 to 10.5%. Independentswho had over a 1% chart share were edel (3%), ZYX (2%), Semaphore(1.2%), SPV (1%) and Rough Trade (1%).The VIVA music TV channel, which plays 40% German repertoire,contributed to the increase in singles sales by German artists. InApril 1995 the company launched a second channel aimed at olderviewers, but playing a similar percentage of German repertoire. The twochannels have a combined reach of 21m people in Germany via cable andsatellite and another 3.5m in Switzerland and Austria, as well asviewers elsewhere in Europe under the Eutelsat footprint (see M&C75/12). As a result of VIVA's success, MTV has increased the amount ofGerman repertoire it broadcasts. In addition a new channel, COM-TV, isdue to start soon. It says it will cater for the 30-55 age group,broadcasting German Schlager, folk, jazz and soul music. The channelcould further exposure given to domestic repertoire.Sales of classical repertoire fell steeply by 10% in the first ninemonths of the year, with no indications of an improved performance inthe last quarter. As a result, classical repertoire's 1995 market shareis predicted to be well below 1994's 9.6% by value and 10.5% by unitsales. Catalogue sales have fallen significantly as the classicalmarket is now. like the pop and rock markets, primarily artist-driven.At the same time the process of vinyl replacement has virtually ended,local industry specialists say. In addition, low price and budgetmaterial now represents a larger section of the classical market.Compilations were another key feature of the German album market in1995, representing 22.7% of the album charts Top 100 over the year.Sales of compilation albums were up 8.3% in the first 10 months of1995, with 27.5m units shipped. But local industry executives arestarting to question the value of the costly television campaignsemployed to market these compilation albums.The majors in GermanyThe major labels all have offices in Germany, except for MCA which isstill distributed by BMG. A company breakdown by album chart share (seepage 8) shows EMI as market leader, in 1995, despite dropping 2.3% from1994. EMI had a strong showing late in the year with two albums by theKelly Family, two by Herbert Groenemeyer, as well as product by TheBeatles, Queen, the Rolling Stones, Roxette and Meat Loaf in the albumcharts Top 20.PolyGram closed in on EMI in second place, raising its album marketshare 2.1% points to 20%. BMG was stable at 16.6%, followed by animproved Warner at 16.1% and Sony showing a 2.2% drop to an albummarket share of just 13.7%.German retailingRetailing continues to be dominated by department and chain stores,where 40% of all soundcarriers are sold. Media Market and ProMarkt arethe biggest chains and the most aggressive price discounters, a trendwhich continued to increase in 1995. A discounted/loss leader album canretail for as little as $5.56 compared with the standard retail priceof $24.34. But there have been talks between the record industry andthe chains and some observers believe that aggressive discounting maysoon be a thing of the past. The success of these chains has led to asharp reduction in the number of independent music retailers over thepast decade.Wholesalers, including rack jobbers, are responsible for 38% of allsoundcarriers sold, direct mail 17% and other outlets 5%. Industryobservers say there are too many wholesalers operating in Germany, andthat many of these are not really wholesalers but exist only to servicetheir own outlets.Among speciality music retailers, the 19-strong German-owned WOM chainis still leader. The Saturn chain is its main competitor. WOM had anestimated 1995 turnover of $130m (87% of that from CD sales, see tableopposite), a rise of 3.8% on 1994.Otherwise successful non-German competitors have failed in Germany.These include French retailer FNAC and Virgin, which closed its lastGerman store in August. Foreign retailers blame strict laws on openinghours, high costs and problems with suppliers for their lack of successin Germany.Nevertheless, HMV still plans to open a 1,500 square meter store nearDusseldorf in September 1996. German retail outlets may open onlybetween 9 am and 6:30 pm on weekdays (until 8:30 pm on Thursdays) andmust close at 2 pm on Saturdays, except the first Saturday of the monthwhen they can stay open until 6 pm. No Sunday opening is permitted. Achange in the law on Sunday opening is not foreseen, but the recordindustry is optimistic a proposed relaxation of opening hours, due tobe approved later this year, will benefit soundcarrier sales.CD player ownership has continued to rise. The number of householdswith one CD player or more (saturation rate) rose to 59% in 1995 with apenetration level (number of players per hundred households) of 78%.Video recorder saturation is 66%. It is estimated that only onehousehold in 250 has either a MiniDisc or DCC player. However, anestimated 50% of the German population never buys a record of any type.The video marketThe video rental and sell through market is still growing in Germany,with sell-through revenues outpacing rental for the first time in 1993and reaching $661m in 1994. Sell through revenues are expected to havereached $696m in 1995, with the rental market growing 6% after a fallin 1994. According to European Video Review, there are 6,400 outlets inall for purchase or rental of video tapes in Germany, 3,000 of themsupplied by rack-jobber MedienPlus. As with audio retailing, thesector's growth is hampered by Germany's strict opening hours and thelack of speciality multiples.A new higher tax on receipts from touring could be backdated six yearsand managers of top international acts have already protested againstthe move and threatened not to tour in Germany as a result. One Britishconcert promoter estimated his backdated tax bill could reach $1.6m.High grossing acts such as U2 and Dire Straits would be among the mostseriously affected by the new tax. UK managers, accountants andpromoters met in December and formed a six-strong steering committee tolobby for the decision to be reversed. They hope to meet with Germany'sfinance minister to discuss the issue.Following the incorporation of the European Union's cable and satellitedirectives into German copyright law, which was effective from, January1 1996, the country now enjoys one of the world's highest levels ofintellectual property protection. Directives regarding rental, andduration of protection for producers, increased from 25 to 50 years,came into force July 1 1995, with a one year retroactive provision.This effectively ended the trade in unauthorised compilations by thelikes of Elvis Presley and the Beatles.Germany had 600 CD rental shops as well as 2,000 video rental shopswhich also rented some CDs before the new legislation was introduced.The new law affords producers and companies the exclusive right tosanction or prohibit rental. To date none has given approval for therental of their recordings. Rental CDs typically featured chartrepertoire and usually were rented out at $1.50 a time. An estimated90% of them were taped.Currency fluctuations and price differentials sparked an increase inparallel imports to Germany in 1995. Most of the product came fromSweden, because the value of the Swedish Krona fell steeply against theDeutschmark, and also from Britain and Italy. Industry estimatessuggested the retail value of parallel imports could be over $140m in1995, up from $125m the previous year.PiracyPiracy rates continued to fall, however, mostly due to the effectiveenforcement of a new copyright law in Poland, which had long been amajor source of pirate product. Improved co-operation between Polishand German customs officials has also helped stem the flow ofcounterfeit material from eastern Europe. However, pirate materialcontinues to filter in from Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech and Slovakrepublics and even Kazakhstan. The pirate market was worth an estimated$97m in 1994, down from $153m in 1993. It is expected to drop again in1995.Until recently a so-called "protection gap" existed in German law,whereby bootlegs of concerts by EU citizens were allowed to be sold inGermany if they were recorded in countries which were not signatoriesof the Rome convention - notably the US. This loophole was all buteliminated by a European Court ruling in a case involving Phil Collins,which immediately took hundreds of thousands of bootleg CDs out ofcirculation. The protection gap was finally closed on January 1 1996with the harmonisation of EU member states' copyright legislation.GERMANY: ALBUM CHART SHARES 1995 (%)BMG*               16.6   (16.6)EMI                23.1   (25.4)PolyGram           20.0   (17.9)Sony               13.7   (15.9)Warner             16.1   (15.3)Others             10.5   ( 8.9)* including MCA.

The US HighCourt's refusal to hear the case has left undisturbed the Ninth CircuitCourt of Appeals ruling, which earlier this year placed a cloud overthe copyright status of virtually every musical composition released ona phono-record in the US prior to January 1 1978.The National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) and other Americansongwriter and music publisher groups are currently spearheading theeffort to convince Congress to revise the US Copyright Act in order tothwart the potentially disastrous effects of La Cienega. However, untilCongress acts, it will be very difficult for copyright owners andproprietors to be sure of the viability of their pre-1978 musiccopyrights, or to enforce their rights in such works through litigationwithin the Ninth Circuit (which includes the state of California)without placing such copyrights at risk.In order to understand the full implications of La Cienega somebackground information on a rather esoteric area of US Copyright Law isnecessary. Many aspects of copyright protection for works created priorto January 1 1978 remain subject to the "old" US Copyright Act of 1909.That act did not state with clarity whether the distribution of aphonorecord would constitute publication of the musical work embodiedin that phonorecord. However, the music industry came to rely on theinterpretation of the US Copyright Office that such distribution didnot constitute publication. This view was confirmed by the SecondCircuit Court of Appeals sitting in New York in the case of Rosette vsRainbow Record Mfg Corp (1976).For close to twenty years, therefore, it has been considered as asettled issue in the US that musical works distributed on phonorecordsprior to January 1 1978 were not thereby published. Thus, no copyrightnotice for the musical composition embodied in each phonorecord wasrequired and no renewal of the musical work 28 years following suchfirst distribution of phonorecords was necessary in order to keep thework out of the public domain.The court in La Cienega however, reached the opposite conclusion. Thecase involved rock band ZZ Top in a copyright infringement actionbrought by the copyright owner of La Cienega Music regarding John LeeHooker's composition Boogie Chillin. The court found that Hooker's songwas in the public domain, having been published upon its first releaseon phonorecord in the late 1940s - "published" being the key word here.Under the 1909 Act, the court said, copyright in the work had to berenewed 28 years later in order to preserve protection. Even if suchrenewal had been properly filed, the court went on to say, the absenceof copyright notice for Boogie Chillin on the phonorecords had likelyplaced the work into the public domain anyway. Such copyright noticewas virtually never included on phonorecords.The effect of the Ninth Circuit's decision could be to decimate themusic community in the US. If left in place, the decision threatens tobring chaos to the industry, throwing doubt on the holdings of musicpublishers and threatening the rights of the authors of works publishedbefore 1978. Already there is evidence that some copyright users may beattempting to use the decision as an excuse not to pay royalties onsuch compositions, under the presumption that the copyright owner willnot risk exposing the copyright through litigation to a finding that ithas fallen into the public domain. The failure of Congress to intervenecould easily spell disaster for thousands of songwriters and musicpublishers in the US, and for their foreign counterparts whose workshave been embraced by the American public.NMPA has made the overturning of this precedent its most importantlegislative goal this year. While the American music publishingindustry supports wholeheartedly legislation currently pending beforeCongress to extend the term of US copyright protection, and opposesvehemently legislation which would unfairly diminish US performingrights royalties for musical compositions, the preservation ofcopyright protection itself on thousands upon thousands of pre-1978compositions must command all our energies. We are both hopeful andconfident that supporters of intellectual property rights in Congresswill act in a timely manner to cut off the potentially devastatingeffects of the Ninth Circuit's decision in La Cienega before they havea chance to take hold.Charles SandersThe author is the counsel for the Harry Fox Agency Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996DUTCH MEDIA COMPANY WEGENER BUYS ARCADEDutch media publisher Wegener is to take over Netherlands' independentrecord and media company Arcade.

The company expects 1995 earnings of$596.5m and a 15% increase in net profits to about $37m.After the merger, Arcade's current activities will be grouped into adivision called Arcade Entertainment Group, which will be managed byArcade's current president H Heinsbroek. At present Arcade comprisesfour main divisions: music, media, retail and film/video and employs700 people. Arcade revenues in the 1994/95 fiscal year to March 31 were$247.3m, with net profits of $10.5m.The Arcade Music Company (AMC) has three divisions, the record companyCNR Music, the classical label Vanguard Classics and the Arcade TVmarketing company.

Pirate salesrose that year by 38% to $142.2m, according to IFPI. Sales of pirateMCs rose by 15% and sales of pirate CDs rose by 150% from 1993. Pirateproduct represented 32% of the market in unit terms. Because of thishigh level of piracy, IFPI estimates that record companies are losingnearly $150m a year.IFPI says that Italy accounts for 44% of the 47m pirate recordings inthe European Union (EU) and that Italy exported 15m bootleg CDs in1994. According to IFPI, half of all MCs, which account for a third ofall recordings sold in Italy, are illegal copies. This seriouslyaffects Italian artists because 60% of all cassettes sold are ofItalian repertoire. IFPI says 20% of CDs sold in Italy are pirated.These figures make Italy the fifth largest pirate music market in theworld.IFPI argues that the high level of piracy has meant that companies havenot invested in their Italian operations. In 1991 Italy's share oflegitimate sales in the EU was 7%. This had fallen to 5% in 1994. Thegrowth of the Italian soundcarrier market has also been dramaticallyaffected by piracy. Between 1991 and 1994 the legitimate market shrankby 20% to $535m, whereas legitimate sales rose 9% over the same periodin the rest of the EU.IFPI and FIMI will open the offices of their new anti-piracy operationFederation Against Music Piracy (FPM) in Milan later this month. IFPIand FIMI and the six major record companies are to spend $1m on theanti-piracy office. FPM aims to improve law enforcement in Italy. IFPIpoints out, for example, that no convictions are expected in five casesit began in 1994 until 1999 at the earliest. Similarly, a January 1995change in the law, which closed a loophole and criminalised illegalrecordings of live performances, is ineffective unless authors' groupsuse their legal rights to secure a long term bans on the licensing inItaly of such recordings. FPM will help them do this.FPM will also improve information gathering about the trade incounterfeit and bootleg product in Italy. It is thought organised crimeis involved and that most of the pirate market is in the south of thecountry with only 26% in the north. Naples is thought to be the centreof the trade and the entry point for material from North Africa andeastern Europe.IFPI cites the example of Spain as evidence that anti-piracy campaignscan work. In 1984 the piracy rate in Spain was 34%. This fell to 5% by1989 after a concerted campaign and stronger copyright legislation, andby 1995 piracy had been virtually eliminated.Back to Headline List CopyrightMUSIC & COPYRIGHT via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996WARNER IS LEADING DISTRIBUTION COMPANY IN THE USWarner was the leading distribution company in the US in December,according to SoundScan which collects point of sale information aboutsoundcarrier sales.

The axe isfalling heaviest in sales and marketing, reflecting a move away fromdoor-to-door sales towards telesales, which Nynex regards as moreefficient (they accounted for a quarter of sales in 1995).Senior management will be cut by 20 per cent.  John Killian, who hasjust taken over as chief executive, will not be replaced in his oldrole of chief operating officer.  Strategy director Sally Davis, whodrew up the restructuring plan with Killian and chief financial officerNicholas Mearing-Smith, is moving to the parent company's New Yorkoffice to undertake a similar role.  There was only one seniorcasualty:  Peter Morse, executive director of the southern block offranchises.Nynex had become increasingly sensitive to criticism from industryanalysts that its cost-base was much higher than that of all other UKoperators.  Given its size, one might have expected lower costs througheconomies of scale.The company's net operating expenses for staff, marketing andadministration were 132 per cent of its revenues for the nine months toend-September 1995.  The figure compares with one of 80 per cent forTeleWest, the UK's biggest cable operator.The UK Nynex company grew from 200 people four years ago to 2,900 bythe end of 1995.  As one senior executive put it, ``we grew by 300 toomany.  That's not so bad.  A cable company bases its growth on anexpected customer base and expected revenues.  We did not get thetelevision customers we expected, but the whole industry expectedmore.''In the past, Nynex has justified its position as the big spender of UKcable by saying that its customer service and churn rate -- theproportion of subscribers who quit the system -- are the best in theindustry and that it is counter-productive to rush to breakeven on thebasis of poorer service.  The company's churn rate may no longer be thebest, but it is close to the best and, at 30.3 per cent, contrastsstrongly with TeleWest's 45.7 per cent.On the other hand, Nynex's penetration -- the number of subscribersexpressed as a percentage of those who could take the service becausethe cable passes their homes -- is much lower than TeleWest's: 18.9 percent against TeleWest's 21.4 per cent and the industry average of 20.8per cent.  Nynex knows that it must increase its sales, but suggeststhat the churn rather than the penetration figures may turn out to bethe biggest contributor to long-term success.Nynex's spending on customer service is arguably well-justified.Arguably, too, TeleWest should have spent far more to keep its churnlower and, indeed, has recently increased its spending.  According toMearing-Smith, ``it costs you money to get to where Nynex has in termsof customer service.  We don't want to lose what we have, but we needto make it more economic.''Nynex hopes to reduce the cost of sales, marketing and administrationto 50 per cent of its revenue-base by the end of this year, the levelit expects TeleWest to achieve.Nynex's restructuring could be be seen as part of a wider trend withinthe industry.  As one senior analyst put it, ``it's not a generalpanic, but there is a sharpening of focus on why cable television isstill not selling well.''  Last year, TeleWest carried out a smallrestructuring in its London South operations, shedding 20 jobs.The Nynex moves to some extent reflect a change in corporate cultureresulting from the UK company turning itself from a wholly-ownedforeign subsidiary of a monolithic regional Bell telephone company intoa public company last June (though major policy decisions still have togo through the slow process of gaining US approval).The company was keen to dispel any impression that the restructuringrepresented the opening shots of a new management style: it was purelya coincidence that the moves were announced during the week ofConnell's departure.As Mearing-Smith pointed out, the restructuring plan was drawn up inthe wake of a ``priority resourcing'' study carried out by Coopers &Lybrand, the management consultants.  This was started in October,before it was clear that Connell's tour of duty would end at the turnof the year.Mearing-Smith said that the restructuring was ``the kind of grown-upbehaviour shown by big companies and shareholders should feel goodabout it.''Not all observers accept the merits of centralisation.  One analyst,Andrew Walsh of NatWest Markets, said: ``I don't think it is a goodthing.  At this stage of the operation, it makes sense to putmanagement resources as close to the franchises being managed aspossible.''Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes that, even withthe changes, Nynex will find it hard to reach breakeven by the end ofthe year.Even so, analysts generally welcomed the moves -- Nynex was, after all,only doing what they had criticised it for not doing in the past.However, the share price fell 2p on the day of the announcement (Mondaymorning), closing at 105p.  It fell further on Tuesday to an all-timelow of 104p.Nynex plans: Nynex is centralising the management of its three regionalfranchise blocks in the south, the Midlands and the Manchester area.Departmental executives will report to their central chief rather thanto regional bosses.  Nynex believes that one central sales organisationcovering all franchises and focusing purely on sales is more efficientthan having sales undertaken regionally and combined with marketing.The main information system which is provoking the staff cuts is theIBM-based ICMS integrated cable-television and telephony subscriber-management system, which the company introduced last year.The company is also adding a workforce-management system, designed toimprove efficiency between the sales and installation arms, and anautomated voice-response unit to handle all customer calls, directingthem to the relevant departments.  It plans to introduce tele-marketingsoftware which will be integrated with the ICMS system.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996UK GOLD COMES OFF VIDEOTRON SYSTEMSUK Gold, the Astra satellite entertainment channel, has refusedVideotron the right to distribute it on its cable networks in a bitterrow over carriage terms.The channel, which carries archive BBC and Thames programmes, will comeoff on February 12, losing 89,000 subscribers, two per cent of itstotal satellite and cable subscription.UK Gold, the most popular new-media channel among adults outside theBSkyB stable, has told Videotron that it should be carried onVideotron's lowest tier of channels, ensuring that it is seen byvirtually all subscribers.Videotron, which owns networks in West and North London and inSouthampton, refuses to move it from a higher tier, where there arefewer subscribers and therefore less revenue for UK Gold.The row results from Videotron's policy of putting so-called ``basic''channels into different tiers rather than a single ``big-basic''package, which is the industry norm.UK Gold said this week that is was prepared to compromise on itsprinciple that it should be receivedby at least 95 per cent of an operator's customers and would acceptbeing put in a more restricted tier -- but only if Videotron were to paya higher per-subscriber fee to compensate it for a smaller reach.It said that Videotron, whose packaging approach has upset severalprogrammers, is being inflexible.  It sent a solicitor's letter to thecable company on Monday.UK Gold used to be carried on a more restricted tier under the terms ofa contract which expired in November 1994.  Talks for a new contracthave dragged on ever since, with the channel being carried on a ``goodfaith'' basis.  UK Gold said that Videotron had been paying it muchless than the 29p per subscriber per month it typically charges otheroperators.The channel said that Videotron only recently moved it from the highesttier to the middle (standard) tier, despite a legal obligation to do sobefore the expiry date of the last contract.UK Gold is also angry that Videotron has been selling the channel on ano-la-carte basis to people in the bottom tier -- illegally, in UK Gold'sview -- charging subscribers #1 but handing over only a few pence to thechannel.Videotron, which is the fourth biggest cable operator in the UK, saidthat UK Gold is asking it to pay 10p more than other operators pay --that is, 39p.  UK Gold, however, said that it had put forward a rangeof options with different prices, most of which were below 39p.Videotron said that the price was unfair and suggested that the channelwas being punitive because of its refusal to carry UK Gold's sisterchannel, the women's channel UK Living.  UK Gold denied the linkage.Benjamin Ball, Videotron's director of programming (who, ironically,helped to create UK Gold), said: ``We object to the idea that UK Goldis trying to restrict our ability to offer our customers flexibility.We want to carry the channel, but we are not prepared to sacrifice long-term consumer benefits for short-term benefits to UK Gold.''Videotron now runs three tiers: in ascending order, Option One,Standard Pack and Super Pack.  The Standard Pack also carries thechannels of Option One, and the Super Pack also carries the channels ofboth lower packs.UK Gold wants to be carried in Option One, which contains only twosatellite channels, Sky One and Sky News, the only channels to bewatched by all Videotron subscribers.  At present, it is carried in theStandard Pack and the Super Pack which, together, reach about 85 percent of subscribers.  The channel's coverage increases to 87 per cent --89,000 subscribers -- because of Option One viewers who take it o lacarte.Bruce Steinberg, chief executive of UK Gold, said: ``I feel bummed outabout disappointing the viewers, but someone's got to draw the linesomewhere.``We are offering Videotron more flexibility.  We are even prepared toallow the company to sell the channel o la carte, which means we haveto go back to other operators to give them the same flexibility.  Butour bottom line is that Videotron must pay a premium for theflexibility.``We hope that Videotron will reconsider its position.''He said that the channel had little time for Videotron's controversialpackaging, which was designed to maximise consumer choice ofprogramming.  ``I would feel comfortable about the packaging ifVideotron`s penetration was double the industry's.  But I don't see anyevidence that this idea has improved penetration.''Videotron's penetration on October 1 was 21.7 per cent, against anindustry average of 20.8 per cent.Videotron argues that its three-tier approach has boosted penetrationand helped to cut churn to one of the lowest levels in the country, anannualised 27.8 per cent (NMM 13:43).  Benjamin Ball, Videotron's headof programming, said: ``Our strategy has been in place for more thantwo years and has proved very successful.''Steinberg said that he is concerned that the packaging of channels isbecoming the ``latest panacea'' to cure the UK cable industry's poorcable-television penetration.  Like other programmers, he suggestedthat what is needed is for operators to improve customer service andmarketing.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996UK FURY OVER PLANS TO CHANGE TV DIRECTIVEThe UK's Department of National Heritage reacted angrily to severalamendments to the European Union's transfrontier broadcasting directivewhich were adopted this week by the European Parliament's culturecommittee.The DNH described as ``just bloody stupid'' an amendment which wouldgive jurisdiction over a broadcaster to the countries receiving thechannels instead of to the country in which the broadcaster isestablished.The DNH said that the amendment goes against the underlying principleof the directive: this is that member states should accept broadcastswhich are properly licensed for distribution in another member state.The UK was also angry at the latest in a long line of attempts totighten up the directive's requirement that channels should have atleast 51 per cent of programming made in Europe.  The DNH said thatamendments passed by the committee went against a ``politicalagreement'' between the member states to stick with the existingwording.However, the council of culture ministers, which was responsible forthe wording of the directive sent to the parliamentary committee, willget a further chance to quash the changes.The amendment made this week by the parliamentary committee threw outthe controversial phrases ``where practicable'' and ``progressively onthe basis of suitable criteria'', which the UK and some other stateshave used to justify a relaxed interpretation of the quota requirement. They replaced them with a clear three-year timetable for compliance.Another amendment disqualifies certain new types of light entertainmentprogramming from counting towards a broadcaster's 51-per-cent quota.However, the DNH welcomed the committee's rejection of several othercontroversial amendments, including one which would have bannedadvertising breaks during programmes aimed at children, and anotherwhich would have required a health warning before advertisements foralcoholic drinks on television.The amended directive will be considered by the full parliament onFebruary 12.  But the committee has still not finished going throughthe 225 amendments proposed by euro-MPs: another 20 will be consideredat a meeting next Tuesday.  The committee has so far adopted 51amendments.The full parliament is expected to reject some amendments beforesending a revised draft to the council of culture ministers.  Thecouncil will then attempt to reach a so-called ``common position'' onthe amended draft, which must then be submitted for final approval bythe parliament.The most controversial of all the 1989 directive's provisions has beenthe one requiring quotas of European-originated programmes.  After manyarguments between the UK which believes that the quotas should bescrapped completely, and France, which believes they should betightened, the culture ministers eventually opted, at the end of lastyear, to retain the directive's existing wording (NMM 13:42).The DNH said that it is ``absolutely opposed'' to the latest amendmentunder which certain light-entertainment programmes would not counttowards the quotas.  Talk shows made in Europe, for instance, would notbe eligble.  The DNH said that the amendment, if adopted, would remove``a lot of investment and employment which is generated by theseshows'' in Europe, and would leave only drama, documentaries and filmsto contribute to the quotas.   At present, many general entertainmentchannels balance the (mainly US) films they show with European talkshows.A senior commission official denied that the amendment would hit soapoperas such as Coronation Street and EastEnders, despite the fears ofsome UK regulators and television executives.  He said that these wouldstill count towards the quotas.  However, he added that the council andthe parliament are heading towards a collision on quotas and that therewould ``have to be a compromise'' to resolve it.Neither the UK nor the commission is happy with the amendment whichswitches jurisdiction of broadcasters to the countries receiving thebroadcasts.  The DNH said: ``If you give the receiving countryjurisdiction, you're multiplying the number of countries withjurisdiction in a way which would make the whole thing unworkable.''A senior commission official said that ``it is not to be taken forgranted that the parliament will accept what the committee hasproposed''.  It is thought likely that the amendment will be rejected,either by the parliament or when the draft is returned to the councilof ministers.The UK is also opposed to an amendment which would extend the scope ofthe directive to cover ``point-to-point'' services, such as video-on-demand.  It said that these services should properly be consideredseparately under telecoms legislation.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996TELEWEST CHIEF LEAVESTeleWest's chief operating officer Danny Bryan has left the companyabruptly.

Nickelodeon is Germany's only children's channel, andhas had considerable success in gaining cable carriage, despite acontinuing capacity crisis (NMM 13:42).The launch of the new public-service children's channel, probablyduring 1997, will offer stiff competition for viewers.  But it is alsolikely to lead to serious cuts in Nickelodeon's cable distribution.Distribution was granted by most media authorities only on a temporarybasis, in anticipation of the possible launch of an ARD/ZDF channel.The idea of a public-service children's channel has long been mooted asa means for ARD and ZDF to exploit their extensive libraries ofchildren's programming and to develop new programmes.  ZDF proposedlaunching a children's channel in 1993, although at that time it wasbeing talked of as a pay service (Satellite TV Finance 4:19).  ARDregional channel Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) also looked at launchinga children's channel (NMM 12:21).The plans foundered because the two broadcasters are legally preventedfrom launching advertising-supported channels.  Under the present plan,the channel would be funded entirely from licence-fee revenues.The idea of a parliamentary channel was put forward by WDR last year.  Asenior ZDF executive said this week that he was surprised that the ideahas received the support of the KEF, ``because we didn't really wantit.''  He said that ZDF had gone along with the proposal primarilybecause it could be used to strengthen the argument for a licence-feeincrease:  ``Every politician is eager to see himself on TV'' (NMM13:35).According to the ZDF executive, the parliamentary channel could beready for launch late this year, with the children's channel followingearly in 1997.ARD and ZDF are desperate for an increase in the licence fee, becausethe success of private commercial channels such as RTL TV, Sat 1 andPro 7 in recent years has led to heavy dents in the public-servicebroadcasters' advertising revenues.  The viewing share of ARD's main(national) network fell from 31 per cent in 1990 to 14.6 per cent for1995, and ZDF's share fell from 29 per cent to 14.7 per cent.The proposed licence-fee increase is in line with the amount requestedby the two broadcasters, but is being described as ``good news for ZDFand bad news for ARD'', although ARD would get the larger share: DM2.35against ZDF's DM2.05 (with another 5 pfennigs going to the mediaauthorities to fund their work).ARD argues that it should have a much larger share of the increasebecause, whereas ZDF is just one station, ARD has to support itsnetwork of so-called ``third'' channels (regional television stations)and also 11 radio stations, employing a total staff of 23,000.  This isrecognised in the way that the existing licence fee of DM23.80 permonth is split 70:30 in favour of ARD.A senior ARD executive said this week that, if the KEF's recommendationis ratified by the state parliaments in March, the broadcaster coulddecide to take legal action against it.The media authorities are also dissatisfied with the KEF proposal toincrease their funding.  The 5 pfennigs rise represents 1.12 per centof the overall increase, against the 2-per-cent share which the mediaauthorities take of the existing licence fee.Any dispute over the apportioning of the increase is likely to lead todelays in the launch of the two channels.Further delays could result if, as seems likely, Nickelodeon takeslegal action against attempts to eject it from cable networks in favourof the new public-service children's channel.In several states, the channel is carried during daytime hours in thecable slot used by the Franco-German public-service cultural channelArte, which broadcasts only in the evenings.  However, these stateshave granted Nickelodeon cable carriage only until the end of the year,in anticipation of the possibility that ARD and ZDF would want cablecarriage for their own children's channel.Because the ARD/ZDF channel will be a public-service one, it willautomatically qualify for ``must-carry'' status in all German states.Even in North Rhine Westphalia, the state which granted Nickelodeon'slicence, precedence will be given to the ARD/ZDF channel.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996RTL-TV DRAWS UP PLANS FOR GERMAN NEWS CHANNELRTL TV, the top-rating German general entertainment channel owned byBertelsmann and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion, isconsidering launching a 24-hour German news channel.The channel could launch in 1997 and would be broadcast in analogueform via cable and satellite and would later move to digital.  RTL hasjust launched a feasibility study on the planned channel.RTL has also approached international broadcasters, including the USnetwork ABC, about providing foreign news coverage.  It is talking tointeractive software suppliers, such as Microsoft Corporation, aboutthe possibility of the new channel incorporating interactivity and``news-on-demand'' facilities.Hans Mahr, RTL director of information and sports, who is in charge ofthe project, said that the main reason for launching a news channel isthat RTL correspondents are gathering far more news than can be used ona general entertainment channel.  He estimated that the channel is ableto broadcast only one tenth of the news it produces.Mahr said that the channel ``must be basically a German channel.''  Pan-European channels such as Euronews ``would never succeed'' because newsis viewed ``from the perspective of where you live.''  Although thechannel is to be German-oriented, it would need foreign partners, suchas ABC, to give it an ``international context''.Several German media regulators and television executives this weekquestioned whether there is a market in Germany for another newschannel.  One regulator pointed out that national news channel n-tv is``still struggling, despite the support of big players'' -- its USshareholders Time Warner and CNN.  In 1995, n-tv's audience share was0.3 per cent.In addition to n-tv, Germany already has another national news andinformation channel in Vox, the ``infotainment'' channel owned by NewsCorporation, Bertelsmann and Canal Plus -- although the channel hasdropped a lot of its original news and information programming in a bidto boost its ratings (NMM 13:30).The RTL channel would also be competing with pan-European news channelsCNN, BBC World and Euronews; pan-European business channels NBC SuperChannel and European Business News; and the widely-respected news andinformation coverage of public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF.  ARD's8pm Tagesschau is still the most-watched news programme on Germantelevision.Mahr said that ARD's and ZDF's news coverage is ``all right for olderviewers who are used to that kind of presentation'', but that foryounger viewers a different style is needed.Not all German commentators were against the idea of another newschannel.  One senior regulator said that the idea of the channel could``make sense'' if viewers could receive the information when theywanted it.  This would be ``a new form of bringing information to thepeople.''A former n-tv executive, who now works for a pan-European channel, saidthat RTL would need only some new studios and perhaps 20 extra staff toproduce the channel for #20 million a year, which ``is not so muchmoney for RTL.''  He expected the new channel's approach to be typicalof RTL -- ``a little more bloodthirsty, a little more scandalous, alittle more mass market-oriented than n-tv.''Most commentators agreed that that the channel would struggle if itwere supported by advertising alone.  However, several commentatorssaid that the channel would make sense if presented as part of adigital subscription package, especially if it were the only newschannel in the market offering interactivity.One senior ZDF executive said that if the channel is of a highstandard, and especially if it brings in good foreign news, ``then weare in really deep trouble, because this is the last area where westill lead.''Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996ARD AND ZDF LOSE SHARE AS PRO 7 SURGES FORWARDGerman public-service channels ARD and ZDF continued to lose audienceshare to their commercial rivals in 1995, with the two market-leadingchannels RTL TV and Sat 1 maintaining their 1994 shares and the Kirch-backed Pro 7 continuing its growth, particularly among children amongwhom it is the most-viewed channel.ARD and ZDF executives were this week comforting themselves that Sat 1had not made bigger audience-share gains in the last two months of theyear, when Sat 1 introduced a raft of new big-budget programming.However, one ZDF executive admitted that it is still ``far too early''to judge the success of Sat 1's new schedules.The executive warned against a too-literal reading of the figures,which are skewed by the fact that they do not take into account thedistribution available to each channel nor the number of hours per dayin which a channel broadcasts.The figures, from GfK, show that RTL-TV took a 17.6-per-cent share ofviewing in 1995, compared with 14.7 per cent for both Sat-1 and ZDF,14.6 per cent for ARD and 9.9 per cent for Pro 7.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996TERRESTRIAL BBC WORLDBBC World, the corporation's 24-hour pan-European cable and satellitenews channel, last week began a four-week period of terrestrialdistribution to five million homes in the Berlin Brandenburg area ofGermany.The channel is being distributed for a trial period on the frequency ofORB, the ARD regional station for the area.

But the higher court, theVerfassungsgerichtshof, ruled just before Christmas that HOT couldcontinue to transmit on Astra 1d to the whole of Germany.RTL could appeal to the German federal constitutional court but saysthis is unlikely because legal action is likely to be overtaken bychanges which are expected to be made to German media law which wouldliberalise tele-shopping.When HOT (Home Order Television), owned by Thomas Kirch's Pro-7 andmail order company Quelle, was granted a licence to broadcast bysatellite to the whole of Germany by the Bavarian media authority onDecember 14, RTL appealed against the decision.  Bavaria had previouslygiven the channel a licence for distribution on two Bavarian cablenetworks.RTL claimed that Bavaria's media law did not give it the jurisdictionto license home-shopping channels as tele-shopping did not count asbroadcasting.Bavaria is to change its media legislation with a new clause expectedto take effect on March 1 that will allow the media authority tolicense interactive media such as shopping channels that might falloutside the strict definition of ``broadcasting''.Under both the European Union's transfrontier directive and Germany'sRundfunkstaatsvertrag, tele-shopping channels are theoretically allowedon air for only one hour a day, but Bavaria's media authority -- likethe UK's Independent Television Commission (ITC) -- has interpreted therule more liberally than some other states (NMM 13:41).  The EUdirective is now being revised (see story on page 3) and is expected toallow home shopping channels on air 24 hours a day.RTL claims that its legal action was not in vain: ``We've had twocourts saying that HOT is in breach of German media law.  I think itwas important to show this.''RTL's chief executive Helmut Thoma has said that his shareholders CLTand Bertelsmann are interested in setting up a tele-shopping channelthemselves and that the Bavarian media authority is giving HOT anunfair competitive advantage by allowing it to transmit nationallybefore the law has been changed.HOT has also just been granted a licence from the UK's ITC.  HOT saidthat it had applied in late November in order to hedge its bets in caseit was not allowed to uplink from Bavaria.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996FRENCH REPORT QUESTIONS EUTELSAT DIGITAL PLANA report on the future of digital satellite television in France hasquestioned the feasibility of the digital package proposed by Frenchpublic broadcaster France Television and commercial station TF1.The report, from national audit body the Cour des Comptes, said thatthe partners lack the technological and commercial expertise to operatea digital bouquet.  It recommends that they consider joining the rivalpackage of Canal Plus and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion.Georges Vanderchmitt, the former director general of France 2 who wrotethe report, also suggested that France Telecom should abandon plans tolaunch its next television satellite, Telecom 2d, and change its roleto that of satellite service provider, selling on capacity leased onEutelsat and Astra satellites.The report, published last week, signals an increasing commercialawareness in French governmental thinking.  It acknowledges theimportance of the Astra satellite system and of internationalcommercial considerations.  In the past, French administrations haddiscouraged channels from using Astra satellites.French telecommunications minister Francois Fillon said that hefavoured a wide alliance of private and public companies to launchdigital satellite television and enable France to catch up with the UKand Germany.Vanderchmitt said that public-service broadcasters such as Arte andFrance Television as well as TF1 should negotiate with Canal Plus andCLT for access to their Astra digital packages rather than press aheadwith plans for rival offerings on Eutelsat's Hot Bird satellites.Canal Plus and CLT are due to launch their digital bouquets by the endof February.TF1 and France Television set up a joint venture company late last yearto look into the possibility of a digital package on the Eutelsatsystem.Vanderchmitt urged France Telecom to follow Deutsche Telekom ininvesting in Astra owner Societe Europeenne des Satellites.  But Fillonsaid that a better option would be for private French companies toinvest in SES.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996OPERATORS AND CHANNELS LAUNCH CABLE SURVEYCable-only programmers and the UK's top cable operators next weeklaunch an audience research project designed to give an accuratepicture of television viewing in cable homes.The research is needed because the existing weekly cable and satelliteresearch from the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (Barb) does notgive viewing details for cable-only channels because its cable sampleis so small.Although channels have taken Barb data and re-cast it to derive apicture of cable-only viewing, they admit that the derived figures arenot reliable enough for firm conclusions to be drawn.The programmers want hard data to help them sell advertising space.The operators are also keen to have an accurate picture of cable-onlyviewing as part of their armoury in carriage negotiations withprogrammers.The survey is being funded by the main cable operators, United ArtistsProgramming, the Independent Television Commission and the cable-onlychannels Live TV, Channel One, SelecTV and Travel.The fruits of the two-week survey should appear in March.  The backersexpect it to confirm the picture shown by their analysis of Barb data,and by a recently published survey of cable viewing from theIndependent Television Commission, that viewers in cable homes watchmore new-media television than viewers in satellite dish homes.The new research is designed to be as close to Barb methodology aspossible, even though it will be diary-based rather than use ``peoplemeters'' like Barb.  Diary research is generally thought tounderestimate viewing to small channels, because respondents forgetthat they have spent time watching them.  The research is being carriedout by Barb contractor RSMB.The ITC survey, carried out over two weeks in October by ContinentalResearch, showed that the share of viewing taken by cable and satellitechannels in cable homes was 39.6 per cent.  This compares with a Barbfigure of 34.6 per cent for the same two weeks, according to ananalysis by New Media Markets.  The Barb figure covers cable andsatellite homes, but mainly satellite homes.David Brennan, research director at United Artists Programming, saidthat his own analysis of RSMB's Barb research showed three keydifferences between viewing in cable homes and viewing in dish homes.First, cable viewers watch more television than their satellitecounterparts.Second, they spend a greater proportion of their time watching non-terrestrial channels.Third, more than half of children's viewing is of non-terrestrialchannels.Brennan cautioned that such conclusions are based on a very smallsample.  Although Barb's cable and satellite sample is designed to bedemographically representative and reflects Barb's establishmentsurvey, the sub-sections of cable and satellite viewers are not inthemselves representative of the cable and satellite universes.So, according to Brennan, when adjustments are made to the cable sampleto ensure that it is representative, its size is reduced from 180 to90.  With such a small sample, there is a greater likelihood ofdistortion, particularly with viewing for small channels and amongdemographic sub-groups, such as children.He said that the suggestion that cable viewers view differently fromsatellite viewers needs to be supported by hard evidence, initiallythrough the new survey but eventually through Barb, when its cablesample is increased as cable subscription in the UK grows.``By the end of this year, the cable element in Barb should be about300 homes which should be enough to allow us to look at itseparately,'' said Brennan.He offered three main reasons why cable viewers might watch more non-terrestrial channels than satellite viewers.First, there are more channels to choose from.  Second, there is a muchgreater penetration of second set-top boxes in cable homes than ofsecond satellite receivers in dish homes.  Third, cable viewers areable to move from terrestrial to non-terrestrial viewing using the sameremote-control handset, whereas satellite dish users generally need touse two separate handsets.The ITC survey, carried out by Continental Research, showed that theviewing share taken by cable and satellite channels in cable homes was39.6 per cent.  Earlier surveys gave a viewing figure of 34.9 per centfor 1994 and 42.1 per cent in 1993.  Last year, the ITC suggested thatthe sharp fall in cable viewing might have reflected the fact thatnewer cable homes were less interested in cable television because theyhad taken a cable service primarily for telephony.The ITC, which is carrying out a review of the annual cable viewingsurveys which it (and its predecessor the Cable Authority) havecommissioned since 1990, admits that it has found some of the researchimplausible.  This year's survey suggested that the upmarket EuropeanBusiness News channel was more popular in lower-class homes than in thechannel's target AB demographic group.  The ITC found this as hard tobelieve as an earlier survey's suggestion of heavy viewing of the AdultChannel among children.Jon Davey, ITC director of cable and satellite, said:"One of the problems has always been the relatively small size of thesample and therefore there are difficulties in drawing too manyconclusions".  Although the survey involved 1,306 one-week diaries from653 respondents, the number who watched individual channels wassometimes in single figures.  The new cable research will involve asample of about 1,200 viewers.The survey showed that Sky One has been overtaken by BSkyB premium filmchannels as the most popular non-terrestrial channel in cable homes:its share fell from 6.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent, while the MovieChannel took top place with 5.8 per cent (up from 4.9 per cent) and SkyMovies second place with 5.2 per cent (down from 5.4 per cent).The NMM analysis of the dish-oriented Barb data for the same two weeksin October shows several differences among channels.  UK Gold,Nickelodoen, TCC, Discovery, Eurosport and MTV all did better in cablehomes.  Sky News did far worse.Comparisons are difficult, partly because the ITC cable figures are forall individuals aged two and above, whereas the Barb lower limit isfour years old.  Further, the ITC cable figures reflect each channel'sown universe of homes rather than all cable homes.  Barb covers allcable and satellite homes.  For this reason, the NNM comparison coversonly those channels whose cable universe is close to (has at least 95per cent of) the total cable universe.Children's viewing of new-media channels in cable homes accounts forwell over half their total television viewing (54.4 per cent, comparedwith 47.3 per cent in 1994).  Among younger children (2-9 year-olds),the trend is more pronounced, with cable and satellite channelsaccounting for 63.9 per cent of viewing.The survey also showed that the penetration of second set-top boxes hasincreased from 28.4 per cent of cable homes in 1994 to 34.8 per cent in1995. The Movie Channel, Sky Movies, Sky Sports and the Cartoon Networkgained greater audience share among homes with multiple set-top boxes.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996NETHOLD MAY NOT FIND PAY-SPORTS WILL EASILY BEAT A FREE CHANNELCan a free sports channel compete successfully against a premium sportschannel?  The UK experience suggests the battle would be one-sided,.with the premium channel bringing in enough subscription revenue to makeit worth its while paying high prices for sports rights.Scandinavia may well show that television life can be different thatKinnevik's planned free sports channel, Sportkanalan, can beatNetHold's recently-launched premium channel, Supersport.There are many similarities between the two channels.  First, they arenot stand-alone channels, but intrinsic to the direct-to-home satellitepackages which the rival programmers are trying to push in the Nordicmarket.Second, each operator plans to run customised feeds to deliver opt-outprogramming to the different language markets of the region.  Althoughwinter sports are popular in all Nordic countries, there aredifferences of taste among the four countries.Third, the channels look set to roll out very similar schedules: amixture of top sports and "wallpaper" sports.  Both have deep pocketsand are prepared to fork out the necessary cash for top sports events.As the New Year gets under way, it does not appear that the premiumSupersport has significantly more top events than the freeSportkanalan.  So it is hard to see how it will be able to establishascendancy quickly, at least not in the devastating way in whichBritish Sky Broadcasting's Sky Sports so easily pushed the establishedScreensport into its terminal plight.Supersport launched in Scandinavia last month using the Intelsat 601satellite to reach cable head-ends.  Although it launched in analogue,it will also become a key part of NetHold's planned digital satellitepackage due to be launched on the Astra 1e satellite in the next fewmonths.  Sportkanalan is due to launch in March on the ScandinavianSirius satellite.Most observers believe that the free Sportkanalan will be the likelywinner.  Few believe that there is room for two dedicated sportschannels in the Nordic market.  Some suggest that there may be room forneither, given the presence of Eurosport Nordic, the regionalisedversion of the pan-European Eurosport channel, which has the rights toseveral top events, particularly in winter sports.Peter Legaard, Nordic media director for Ogilvy and Mather, isconvinced that Sportkanalan stands the better chance in the region.  Hethinks that both channels have a good mix of programming andadvertisers will be pleased that they will appeal to young maleviewers.But he believes that Sportkanalan will do better simply because it willbe free.  With more and more pay channels being offered, "there is alimit to how much people will pay for television.  The time peoplespend watching television will stay the same."Scandinavian Broadcasting System's managing director Jan Steinmannbelieves that Scandinavia is too small a market to handle andadvertising-supported sports channel.  He points to escalating rightsfees in the region and wonders if enough advertising revenue could everbe raised to make a profit.  He claims that it is these high fees thathas convinced him to drop sports events on the cable and satellitechannel, Femmen.  It will now bill itself as the region's "sports - andnews-free" alternative.Public-service broadcaster SVT and the Eurosport satellite channel arealso, not surprisingly, sceptical.Bo Gentzel, SVT head of sport who turned down the job of managingdirector at both new channels, does not believe that Scandinavia needsmore sports channels?  "We are not as television-mad as Americans.  Idon't think the audience for both channels will be very high.  Swedenis half the size of London in terms of population.  So, we don't thinkthe channels will be a threat, but they will be good for the sportsidiot."Eurosport also believes that Scandinavia is too small a televisionmarket for three sports channels.  As a result, says Vincent Chupin,the channel's head of sports acquisition, there may well not be enoughadvertising to justify a free sports channel.Both Supersport and Sportkanalan have had to agree shared deals withestablished terrestrial channels, perhaps sub-licensing events fromthem.  This is because so many rights in the region are already tiedup, and this will be the case until the end of decade when many come upfor renegotiation.It is here that some observers believe Sportkanalan will have theadvantage, as Kinnevik already has a cosy relationship with terrestrialbroadcasters, especially SVT.  They argue that Kinnevik, as a powerfulregional programmer, is more knowledgable of the region's tastes.Sportkanalan: Once bitten, twice shy, seems to be the guiding principlebehind Kinnevik's decision to create a free sports channel rather thana pay-channel.Kinnevik shut down the Filmmax pay-movie channel last autumn because itcould not get enough subscribers.  Subscriptions for its TV1000 filmand entertainment channel have not been good and the channel lostSKr110 million (#10.7 million) in the first half of 1995.  There haveeven been reports of talks between Kinnevik and arch-rival NetHoldabout merging TV1000 into NetHold's FilmNet channels.Kinnevik is not interested in getting its fingers burned again on a paychannel.  It believes that its free sports channel can outgun NetHold'spay-channel for three reasons:* Sports fans in the region are used to watching sport on televisionfor free* A free channel will attract more viewers than Supersport and this, inturn, should enable it to attract more premium events looking for``eyeballs''* It will be easier to convince cable networks to take the channel -- animportant consideration in Norway where cable subscribers vote todecide which channels are offered.Sportkanalan will need to convince advertisers that a tiny viewingshare is worthwhile.  Managing director Lasse Haglund believes that thechannel can live with a 1-per-cent viewing share.Veteran sports rights negotiators believe that a low viewing sharecould scare off the owners of some events.  According to SVT's Gentzel,``if you have only a 2-per-cent market share, there will be problemswith the sponsors of sporting events.  There's no point in doing achannel unless you can get a 5-per-cent share.  SVT's normal share forsports events is 15 per cent.''Supersport: NetHold's Supersport is intended to be a must-have forsports fans, whom the programmer hopes will flock to pay for digitaldecoders -- at a cost of SKr6,000 each -- and pay the monthlysubscription fee.At present, the analogue Supersport costs SKr179 a month if bought as astand-alone service or or SKr259 if bought as part of a package withFilmNet1 and FilmNet 2 (the recently re-named FilmNet Plus and CompleteMovie Channel).NetHold sees the premium sports channel as a key element in helping todrive the penetration of its digital package.With Supersport's raison d'etre dependent on its having more premiumevents than Sportkanalan, access to rights is even more crucial.Supersport's acting deputy head Ian Woodrow said that the channel'ssurvival will be linked to the number of live events it can showexclusively.He said: ``People are used to having sports for free, so we must havethe key sports.  We can't charge premium prices for incidentalsports.''During the week, Supersport will broadcast six hours of programming inthe evening, expanding to 12 hours a day on weekends. It will haveseparate feeds for each of the region's languages, with 70 per cent ofthe programming the same for each country.NetHold intends to run Supersport in parallel with its planned pay-per-view channels to:* Maximise revenue of an event by switching, for example, a final matchfrom Supersport to ppv;* Increase interest in Supersport by using ppv sports events as ateaser for the main channel.Jan Friedman, vice-president of NetHold Nordic, admitted that thestrategy would take a degree of finesse to pull off: ``We don't want tomake loyal Supersport subscribers disappointed.''Supersport's search for premium events has proven to be less-than-ideal.  Some critics argue that the line-up (see box) is not worth thesubscription fee.They point out that the channel does not have exclusive rights forSwedish ice-hockey and that TV4, from which the rights are sub-licensed, has a better deal.  Further, Supersport will show only theSunday and Monday matches of the English Premier League: rights for thepopular Saturday matches are held by terrestrial broadcasters.Cable carriage will be another deciding factor.  NetHold is trying topersuade the main cable operators in the region to sell it capacity tocarry four named channels, but with the freedom to use the capacity forits full-blown digital service.  So far, none of the major operatorshas signed the deal.It is much easier for Sportkanalan to convince cable networks to takeone channel, rather than the minimum of four being offered by NetHold.But NetHold's Friedman believes that the company is being generous withits offer. ``Unless cable operators do a deal with us now, they willget so many calls from customers wanting to watch Supersport.  In thefirst couple of years we do need a parallel cable distribution becausethe losses will be very, very high.''Sportkanalan will broadcast 80 hours of programming a week, andaccording to Sternmarker, has already acquired 2,000 hours ofprogramming.  This includes 500 hours of live golf and 100 hours ofsports documentaries produced by TWI.Eurosport: The established player in the market, Eurosport Nordic, isavailable to the DTH market on the Thor satellite and free on mostcable networks.Eurosport's Vincent Chupin thinks that the channel can compete withboth new channels when it comes to rights and programming because it ispart of a pan-European network offering advertisers a large audience.Eurosport, Chupin says, being part-owned by European Broadcasting Unionbroadcasters, will be able to draw on a wide variety of sporting eventsfrom across Europe to attract viewers.Critics, however, argue that the same EBU broadcasters will be temptedto sell some of the choicest programming to the new sports channelspurely because the money will be better.They say all these public broadcasters share the same problems: toomuch programming and too few slots in the schedule to show it; andpressure from tight budgets to increase revenues where possible.  Underthese conditions, loyalty to the EBU and Eurosport could take a backseat to lucrative sub-licensing deals.Chupin thinks Supersport would do well in Sweden if it showed gamesfrom the Swedish football league.  SVT has the rights for this year andan option to renew them until 1998.The key events which neither of the new sports channels have are thisyear's Atlanta Olympics and European football championships, which areboth held by SVT and Eurosport.As for Sportkanalan, Chupin thinks it will at best match Eurosport'stwo to three per cent viewing share, something ``I'm not sure if youcan survive merely in Scandinavia.''Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996ENDEMOL MAY QUIT HMG AS BRUSSELS TURNS UP HEATEndemol Entertainment is considering selling its entire stake in theHolland Media Group in order to safeguard its lucrative programmingcontracts with the group's three television channels.Endemol, the Netherlands largest independent production company, wastold last October by the European Commission that it had to reduce itsstake in the group from 23 per cent to 7.5 per cent.But last month, the commission went further and said, in informal talkswith HMG, that Endemol should reduce the amount of programming it makesfor HMG's three television channels by at least 10 per cent.  Endemolwas also told that it would not be allowed a seat on the shareholders'committee, which oversees the board of directors.Endemol supplies 20 per cent of the output of RTL 4, RTL 5 andVeronica.  It is likely to sell its HMG stake to one or more of itspartners in the consortium: broadcaster RTL 4, Dutch publishers VNU andVeronica.Last October, the commission's competition directorate (DG IV) saidthat HMG was anti-competitive as it stood.

If the regulators decidethat it is pornographic, the channel can be refused permission to go oncable under German media law.Regulators say this is the first time they have had such a request.There are no ``adult'' channels on German cable networks at present.When the German pay-channel Premiere introduced an adult segment twoyears ago, the DLM commissioned an expert from the University ofHamburg to judge whether the programming was pornographic.He judged it on sociological grounds, deciding that it was pornographicbecause it had no plot and women had no role or character other than tosatisfy men, the typical role of women in pornography.  As a result,the programming was withdrawn.The DLM should come to a decision on the Adult Channel within sixmonths and may well commission an expert in a similar way.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996LIVE TV HOPES FOR BOOST FROM DARTS, SOAP AND ADSLive TV, the Mirror Group's cable channel, admitted this week that itscontroversial screening of ``topless darts'', which started on Monday,had been criticised by professional women's darts players.The darts contests, filmed on Australian beaches, run for two minuteseach night at 11pm.  Live TV denied that the contestants -- women of acertain age and shape -- had been chosen on the basis of their looksrather than their ability to project darts at a board.  The programmingwas neither sexist nor exploitative, said Live TV, but ``good cleanfun.''The darts programmes will be followed next Monday by the debut of thechannel's soap opera, Canary Wharf, which is equally sexual in content,featuring bed-hopping among television executives of a range of sexualorientations.  Publicity for the programme promises that ``you're nevermore than five minutes from a snog.''The new programming is being backed by a #1 million radio and posteradvertising campaign which the channel claims is the biggest by a UKcable-only channel.  The campaign uses the slogan ``Look on the brightside'' -- something which the Mirror Group hopes to do if the newprogramming boosts the poor ratings of the channel in which it isinvesting #30 million.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996PERFORMANCE TO EXPANDPerformance, the cable arts channel owned by Associated Newspapers, isto move to satellite distribution in March via the Orion 1 satellite.The channel, at present tape-delivered, will increase its transmissionhours and will seek to gain an audience on cable networks inScandinavia and the Benelux countries.It will also introduce strip-scheduling, broadcasting jazz programmingat the same time each day during weekdays and opera at weekends.Audience feedback for the channel, which is aimed at an upmarketaudience, suggested that jazz and opera were its most popularofferings.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996BRUNO AND MAN UTD TOP YEAR'S NEW-MEDIA CHARTSCable and satellite's most popular programme of 1995 -- and most popularever -- was Frank Bruno's successful challenge for the WBC WorldHeavyweight Championship against Oliver McCall in September.The programme attracted 2,248,000 viewers, giving it a TVR (percentageof those people who could watch it) of 17.3 and a viewing share of 42.7per cent in Astra dish and cable homes.The charts have been compiled by New Media Markets as part of ananalysis of viewing data from Barb (Broadcasters Audience ResearchBoard).The second most popular programme was one of last season's key PremierLeague matches -- Manchester United v Blackburn Rovers, with 2,036,000viewers (TVR 16.8 and viewing share 41.7 per cent).Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's dinosaur epic, came in at Number 3,attracting 2,007,000 viewers for the Movie Channel.The film was the only programme to break Sky Sports monopoly of the Top10.  Only one other non-sports programme -- the film, Demolition Man, in14th place -- made the Top 20.  Sports programmes took 26 of the Top 30Astra programmes and 35 of the Top 50 programmes, with the premium filmchannels and Sky One performing respectably in the 40s.If Frank Bruno was new-media's biggest one-night stand, ManchesterUnited was its most consistent star.  Five top soccer matches took thefourth-to-eighth positions, with Manchester United playing in all butone of the games, as well as taking the No.2 spot.The third most popular film of the year, after Jurassic Park andDemolition Man, was The Fugitive, followed by Mrs Doubtfire and JungleBook.  Jungle Book, which launched the Disney Channel on October 1, wasthe most popular non-BSkyB Astra programme, with 1,303,000 viewers.  Itwas the only non-BSkyB programme to get more than a million viewers andthe only one to make the overall Astra Top 50 chart.Disney also took the second and third places of the non-BSkyB chart,both with screenings of the film, Cool Runnings.  But the chart wasdominated by the Cartoon Network, with 32 of the Top 50 programmes.Sky One was the most popular channel over the year as a whole, with aviewing share of 5 per cent, according to the New Media Marketsanalysis.  The share was hit by a poor winter (only 4 per cent inDecember).  Sky One's 1994 share was 5.4 per cent.Sky Sports achieved 3.8 per cent for the year, 0.3 points up on 1994.It had a good December, with 5 per cent, and a very good Christmas weekat 7.1 per cent, equalling its second-best weekly share.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996MURDOCH CONSORTIUM BIDS #1.2BN FOR EUROPEAN TV RIGHTS TO OLYMPICSA consortium backed by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the leadingshareholder in British Sky Broadcasting, submitted a bid worth morethan $2 billion (#1.2 billion) for the European broadcasting rights forthe winter and summer Olympics between 2000 and 2008.

"Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for buyers andsellers to get together" in a secure environment, IBM spokespersonMatthew Van Ryn told New Media Week.  "Right now...there's nothing toprevent someone from dropping [copyrighted material] in e-mail andsending it to 1,000 of their closest friends."       Ultimately, the technology will give developers control over thepricing and rights to a piece of copyrighted information.       IBM plans to take 10 to 20 percent "or whatever it's going tobe," of what the content provider charges the user, said Van Ryn. Thatpercentage will be fixed and the company has no plans to chargesubscription or online fees.       Industry analysts believe that the technology may even help toencourage the proliferation of online content developers who have,thus far, been weary of unauthorized mass-distribution of their workover the Internet.       In theory, online developers have instant access to consumers atlittle or no transaction costs.         "The difficulty is that [their content] has been freelyforwardable to everybody else," said Dean Gloster, a partner in theMultimedia group of San Francisco law firm Farella, Braun & Martel."Copyright infringement is a hobby on the Internet," he added.Reaping Benefits       It's not only IBM that stands to profit from the new technology.             Developers will benefit in two ways:  they will not haveto convert their databases for online use, and they will have controlover how the content looks and how much subscribers pay for it, saidVan Ryn.       The technology holds so much promise for increased security, notto mention greater contact with customers, that such content providersas American Business Information Inc. (ABI) have already signd on asone of IBM's pre-eminent content providers.       ABI provides Yellow Pages information for every U.S. community.       IBM measured up to ABI's criteria for choosing an online vehiclefor its content.       "What we do is look at the firewalls that [an Internet service]can demonstrate to us," said Bill Kerrey, ABI's senior vice presidentof business development.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW MEDIA WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996CAMBRIX, TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX CROSS-PROMOTE AVIATION PRODUCTS       Piggybacking on the marketing strength of major film studios,new media companies like Cambrix Publishing are discovering thatcross-promoting their titles with hit movies is a sure-fire way toboost unit sales.       Last week, the company launched a marketing campaign withTwentieth Century Fox to promote Cambrix's Wild Blue Yonder aviationCD-ROM set and Fox's Broken Arrow feature film about futuristic B-3bomber pilots.         Integral to the strategy is a rebate offer that aviation fansmay find hard to resist.  With any purchase of the CD-ROM set betweenJanuary 1 and April 15, Cambrix will rebate the full price of a movieticket (up to $7.50) to see Fox's Broken Arrow.       "We [plan] to use the resources of the studios wheneverpossible," said Cambrix Vice President Richard Hart.         One of the best ways to promote a title is tie it or complementa movie.  "Then you piggyback on someone else's promotion," andbenefit from the association, said Hart.       "The [airplane] technology you see in Broken Arrow...is veryintegral to the [movie's] plot," he said.  "Because of that...peoplewill want to know more about what these fighters are all about."       Hence, Cambrix's CD-ROMs that detail the history of aviation andthe technology "deepens people's appreciation for the movie," saidHart.Traditional Vs. Non-traditional       Lauded as the first time a film studio and CD-ROM publisher havecross-promoted somewhat unrelated products, the strategy is a mix oftraditional and non-traditional marketing strategies.       The rebate offer requires the consumer to mail the CD-ROMreceipt and movie ticket stub into Cambrix for full refund on the costof the movie.       With a suggested retail price of $19.99, Cambrix claims this isone of the most significant rebate offers undertaken to date.  Butit's not the only movie rebate offer ever undertaken.       Walt Disney last year recruited the 2,600 movie theatersplanning to show its animated film Toy Story to offer movie-goers a $5Toy Story videogame rebate coupon at ticket windows.  Consumers had tothen bring their ticket stub to Toys "R" Us for their discount.Marketing Beyond Rebates       In addition to the rebate offer, Fox provided Cambrix access tothe movie, printed materials, movie posters that include the CD-ROMadvertisement and several pages within its Web site devoted to theWild Blue Yonder/Broken Arrow promotion. (The site will launch todayat www.brokenarrow.com.)  Fox also will further promote the Web siteheavily in print, poster and television advertising of the film.       Within the site is an factual area on today's B-2 bombers andrelated material of Cambrix's title.  "There's very nice synergy...andalso some real "meat" to the site itself," said Hart.  Users can pullup aviation information as well as download clips from the site.         In return, Fox generates interest within the computermarketplace.  "And because of the demographics and the technical baseof the movie...it ties in nicely," said Hart.  "For Fox, they reach amarket they didn't have access to."       What's particularly unique about this campaign is that theproducts are not directly related to one another.  They do, however,share a common theme: Broken Arrow stars John Travolta and ChristianSlater as stealth bomber pilots engaged in an unimaginable conflict;Wild Blue Yonder is a two CD-ROM disc interactive exploration of thetriumphs and tragedies of aviation.       Finally, the marketing strategy also will include a sweepstakesoffering prizes including a trip for two to Hollywood and a visit toTwentieth Century Fox lot.       Fans can enter via the Broken Arrow Web site or through AmericaOnline's Cinema POV Area, which also is highlighting the promotion andenabling cybersurfers to enter the contest.Exception or the Norm       Several multimedia developers told New Media Week this sizemarketing blitz is becoming more than norm than the exception.       "If you look at the amount of money being put into developing[titles], it's no wonder the cost of marketing them is going up,"added Ken Christie, vice president of marketing for the InteractiveMultimedia Association.  "They have to get some kind of a return ontheir investment."       Cambrix, however, seems to be getting the best of both worlds: it's successfully sells its product to movie-goers on a national basiswhile only chipping in $100,000 of its own marketing dollars.         And compared to Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Walt Disneyand Acclaim Entertainment's multi-million dollar marketing campaigns,Cambridge's budget is just a drop in the bucket.Security on the HorizonIBM's upcoming cryptolope technology promises to offer security tocontent developers considering online distribution of their material.       Here's how it works: users who want to purchase any contentoffered through IBM's infoMarket Service will receive the material ina sealed cryptolope container (short for "encrypted envelope") alongwith a key to unlock the package.       Users can purchase whole or partial material. After the contentis downloaded, printed or read, the cryptolope reseals to preventsubsequent copying or transmitting of the material, thereby ensuringthat the user pays for it each time.IBM infoMarket Content Providers:American Business Information   Associated PressBRP Publications Inc.

Although Pixel Genius Entertainment's first title Pocahontas wassuccessful in the retail market-it ranked among educational topsellers at 5,000 copies per month for its first five months-thecompany has discovered that it can boost its profits by selling toeducational institutions.       "There's a much more limited market segment for educationaltitles [than entertainment titles], and this is no exception," saidPaul Janavs, co-president of Pixel. "Entertainment products are aimedat a much larger target market. But the [education] market is growingvery rapidly and it still has a whole other side of distribution,which is the school market."       Pixel is banking on increasing its profits by 75 percent byjumping into this virtually untapped market.        On Feb. 1 it will introduce the teacher's version of Pocahontas,a reading-oriented title. Unlike the retail version, this one will bepacked with cross-curriculum activities, touching not only on languagearts, but on math and science as well.         The company declined to disclose sales figures or projections onthe upcoming version.A Retail SupplementJack Bocock, marketing director of Boxer Inc., another educationalsoftware developer, agrees that the industry can count on schools forheavy sales.  His company targets only that segment of the market.         "Real education titles are natural for a school environment,"Bocock said.  "The [retail] channel is a tough channel for all of us. There are few who make money in that channel, even entertainmentsoftware.  For real educational titles, [the retail market] is notfeasible."       But some industry analysts disagree.  Peter Rogers, an analystwith Bear Stearns & Co. , said focusing solely on the school market israre.         Targeting consumers first has worked best for such majoreducational software companies as The Learning Co. , Davidson &Associates and Broderbund .       "Sometimes they've supplemented their efforts by going  directlyto schools, but it's consumers that drive the business," he said.Tackling Distribution       Pixel, however, is not deterred.  To reach the education market,the company first found a target market less crowded with competitors.              Pocahontas is one of the few educational titles thattargets an older age group, Janavs said. It's aimed at 5- to10-year-olds instead of 3- to 6-year-olds, like most reading titles.       On the distribution front, the company is signing up withspecial wholesalers who distribute exclusively to education buyers.         Pixel also has contacted mail-order catalogs that cater toteachers.        The company is even tailoring its packaging for the educationmarket by offering the teacher's version in bulk packs of 30 andadditional 5-pack for student computer laboratories.         By focusing its marketing strategy on this niche, Pixel isbetting it can earn profits totaling three-quarters of what it earnsin its retail market.  Differentiating Itself        With competition fierce, Pixel implemented several strategies toensure the success of its Pocahontas school edition.       Unique to this Pocahontas version are activities designed forthe Internet.         "We haven't seen [internet activities on educational software]done, but we know schools are very excited about the Internet," saidPixel's Janavs.       "We're trying to provide [educators] with Internet activitiesrelated to the Pocahontas story book so students will learn to use theinternet as a research tool by gathering information about the historyof Pocahontas."       The teacher's version also includes a teacher's manual thatprovides tear-out pages for worksheets and extension activities forstudents.  Future Plans       Pixel also is taking great care with the versions of products ithopes to distribute to nationwide classrooms.                    Most importantly, the company learned from educators thatbuilding a child's confidence in the title is more effective thanspeaking down to them. "You don't need to oversimplify things forchildren," he said.       Upcoming company plans include expanding its Reading Success forKids series with Jack and the Beanstalk, due out this month, and anAladdin title, which will hit store shelves March 1.

Mature Multimedia, which is creating a merchandising programaimed at snatching up prime retail real estate for its eroticproducts, is planning to do just that.     Wow!, the 60,000-square-foot multimedia superstore co-owned byTower Records and The Good Guys!, will be Mature Multimedia's partnerin crime, serving as the initial site for the pilot that will testconsumer acceptance of the program.     Ten publishers of PG-13, NC-17 and R-Rated CD-ROM jewel-casedtitles will be involved in the market research study that combines alow-tech retail merchandising display rack with high-tech multimediaand the Internet.     But those concerned about "negatively influencing" theirloved-ones' minds, beware.     The CD-ROM sampler will use a 3D graphical interactive televisioninterface that will enable CD-ROM browsers to preview the productssold.  (A Web address also (www.intermaginary.com) provides links toall participating publishers' Web sites in the program.)      Until now, Mature Multimedia products have been classified anddisplayed with graphic XXX adult products.  As a result, sales of"softer erotic content" have suffered, said the company.       Hence, the pilot program opens a new channel to retail soconsumers can browse through the "in-between titles"-  those that maynot be suitable for young, hardcore gamers, but don't classify asX-rated material.  ***     Although maintaining a less-than-admirable track record as aconduit for gameplay, at least three more multimedia industry giantsare betting that the Internet will, no doubt, be a great place forsynchronized PC gaming.     The Total Entertainment Network, Catapult Entertainment and MpathInteractive are preparing Web-based services designed to enablemultiple players to battle it out over the Internet.     But what about the never-ending complaints that the Internet issimply too slow and unresponsive to attract hardcore gamers?  "No problem," say each of the developers.        Overcoming this problem (believed to exist because of so muchincompatible software processing PC commands at different speeds) canbe overcome by writing their own proprietary software for synchronizedgame play over the network.  Or so they say.     ***     It's kind of scary when chess software can beat the game'sleading human grandmasters--everytime.

McParlandAction Letter EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightNEWSNET ACTION LETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1990NEWSFLASH: A NEW CLIPPING SERVICE FOR A NEW DECADEIt's official--the new version of NewsFlash is completed andtested, and we're just about ready to release it.Starting at the end of January, we will be releasing NewsFlash toa group of NewsNet subscribers each week. All subscribers will beconverted to the new version by April.The new NewsFlash incorporates features that you've requested foryears, including the ability to monitor virtually unlimited numbersof phrases, use of complete Boolean logic to construct your keywordphrases, and many, many other enhancements. See "EnhancedNewsFlash... What It Means to You" in this issue for a rundown ofwhat the new version of NewsFlash has to offer.Why the Rewrite?NewsFlash, first released more than six years ago, has been oneof the information industry's premier electronic clipping services(or, as they are also called, SDI or selective dissemination ofinformation services).NewsFlash allowed NewsNet users to monitor up to 10 keyword phrasesfor topics of interest to them, 24 hours a day. Any time informationmatching the interests of a NewsFlash user was received at NewsNet,that information would be posted to the subscriber's NewsNet account.NewsFlash was an instant hit, and quickly became one of the mostpopular features used by NewsNet subscribers. With NewsFlash, therewas no need for interactive searching--NewsFlash would monitor allNewsNet services for your specified keyword phrases, and deliver theresults to you automatically.Room to ImproveNewsFlash sounds like an almost ideal clipping service, andin some ways, it was. As with just about anything else, however, therewas room for improvement, and frequent users of NewsFlash began givingus suggestions on how to enhance the product.We listened, and in 1987, we began actively soliciting feedback onhow we could best improve NewsFlash. What, specifically, did userswant?  We conducted several extensive telephone surveys, and foundthat several suggestions were mentioned especially often:    1.  The ability to monitor more than 10 phrases.For anyone seriously involved in competitive intelligence, animportant application of NewsFlash, 10 phrases just isn't enough, oursubscribers told us. In fact, several of the subscribers we spokewith had more than one NewsNet ID number in order to have more than10 NewsFlash phrases.    2.  Keyword phrases should support the use of full searching        logic.NewsFlash offered only one logical connector--the + sign, used toindicate AND. Users wanted to be able to use such connectors as ORand BUT NOT in their phrases, and to use options allowed insearching, such as parentheses, string searching, and proximitysearching.    3.  Users should be able to decide when articles found by        NewsFlash are delivered.NewsFlash automatically delivered matching articles (called "hits")to the user's NewsNet account, and they were displayed automaticallyupon signon. There was no way to bypass this notification--you had toeither read, save, or delete your NewsFlash hits before you couldenter the NewsNet database.We took all of these concerns--and many others mentioned to us bysubscribers over the years--and began design work on a product thatwould address them.Many ideas and work hours later, at the end of last summer, avestigial version of the new NewsFlash was ready for testing.  Werounded up several important industry figures--writers, researchers,and publishers, to name a few--to help us beat up the new product.The test period continued through the fall as we isolated and fixedwrinkles and flaws in the new NewsFlash, aided by the expertsuggestions and opinions of our outside testers.In early November, the new NewsFlash was officially unveiled for thefirst time at the Online '89 conference in Chicago. NewsNet users andnon-subscribers alike attended the special NewsFlash sneak preview,and the reactions were all we could have hoped for, and then some."This is great," one subscriber said. "I've been using five NewsNetaccounts just so I could have more phrases, and now I won't have to." Others were especially impressed by the complexity of the phrasesnow allowed--up to 256 characters, including the use of full Booleanlogic--and by the fact that hits are delivered only when you wantthem.In This IssueThis issue of the Action Letter is dedicated to the NewsFlashenhancements, and is designed to help you get acclimated quickly tothe new product."Applications of NewsFlash" covers uses for NewsFlash.  "CreatingFolders and Phrases" outlines the rudiments of setting up yourNewsFlash profile, while "Reading Your Hits: A Primer" shows you thebasics of hit retrieval.

Globaloptions govern how your hits will be organized and deliveredthroughout the hit display system. Use the OPTIONS command inFLASH to adjust your global option settings.If you have not changed your global option settings, hits will bedisplayed when you sign on.Regardless of when your NewsFlash hits are actually displayed, youwill receive a brief notification message each time you sign on to theNewsNet system. This message, which displays the number of saved andunviewed hits you have waiting, looks like this:NEWSFLASH NOTIFICATION======================Folder FOLDER000110 unviewed hits, 12 saved hitsIf you have no unviewed or saved hits, a message to this effectwill be displayed.Reading Your HitsIf your hits are displayed upon signon, as they will be if youhave not adjusted your global options settings, you will be takendirectly into the NewsFlash hit display system immediately after theNewsFlash notification message is displayed.If you have more than one folder of keyword phrases, the first promptin hit display asks you to enter a foldername. This prompt looks likethis:Enter foldername, ALL, LIST (folders), or RENOTIFY -->After you enter a foldername (or immediately after you enter hitdisplay, if you have only one folder), the main hit display promptwill be displayed. This prompt looks like this:Enter HEAd for headlines; TExt; SOrt, SUmmary, ANALYZE; or Retrieve(saved or deleted hits) -->At this prompt, you can enter:HEAD to display the headlines of your hits. The order in whichthese will be displayed depends upon the global option settings youhave established. After the headlines are displayed, you can thenchoose to display the full text of any that interest you.TEXT to display the full text of all of your hits, in aparticular folder or for all folders. (Note: To display the full textof all hits in all folders, you must have entered ALL at the "Enterfoldername" prompt.)SORT to set temporary sort specifications for your hits. Thesesort settings will remain active in the current folder for thecurrent NewsFlash session only.SUMMARY to display a count of saved and unviewed hits in each ofyour folders.ANALYZE to display a service code breakdown of publications inwhich hits were found for a particular phrase or phrases.RETRIEVE to retrieve saved and deleted hits.Using the HEAD command is explained below.Displaying Headlines and Text Using the HEAD CommandThe most commonly used command to review NewsFlash hits is theHEAD command. HEAD allows you to review the full text of yourheadlines, and then select headlines numbers of which to review fulltext.To review the headlines of your NewsFlash hits, enter HEAD at thetop-level hit display prompt:Enter HEAd for headlines; TExt; SOrt, SUmmary, ANALYZE; or Retrieve(saved or deleted hits) -->HEADThe order and format in which your hits will be displayed isdetermined by your global options settings. If you have not changedthese settings, your hits will be displayed as follows:Any saved hits you have waiting will be displayed before unviewedhits (hits you have not seen before).Headlines will be displayed one screen at a time (approximatelyfour to five headlines per screen, depending on the length of theheadlines).Hits will be sorted first by issue date from earliest to latest,and then within that sort, alphabetically by keyword phrase.After you enter HEAD and the first group of headlines isdisplayed, you will be prompted as follows:Enter Headline number(s) or ALL to read; PREview, AGain, SAve, Delete,Renew (hits); More or for more hits -->Your choices at this prompt are:To display the full text of one or more headlines, enter theheadline numbers here.

Afterentering PREVIEW, you will be prompted to enter the headline numbers.AGAIN to display this group of headlines again.SAVE to save any or all of the headline numbers displayed.

Saved hits areretained for two days.DELETE to delete any of the headlines in this group. You willthen be prompted to enter the number or numbers of the headlines thatyou want to delete.RENEW to return hits to unviewed status. Renewed hits will appearthe next time you display unviewed hits.

The special commandoptions increase the flexibility of several basic NewsFlash commands.The hidden commands are all based on common NewsFlash commands, buthave an asterisk (*) appended to the end of the command. ALL, forexample, is a valid command at several prompts in NewsFlash; ALL* is ahidden command with a special meaning.Three Special CommandsThere are three of these special "star" commands: ALL*, HEAD*, andDELETE*. These three commands work in a similar way to basicNewsFlash hit display commands, but act on a larger group of hits.They were created to aid the downloader and those who have to managelarge groups of NewsFlash hits.Since each of these three commands is similar to another NewsFlashcommand, they have been omitted from the prompts, and cannot beabbreviated. They are intended specifically for the advanced user whoneeds to access NewsFlash hits quickly and efficiently.ALL*The ALL* command displays the full text of all hits of the currentlyselected type (saved hits, for example, or saved and unviewed hits),and then changes the status of these hits to deleted. ALL* isespecially useful for those subscribers who want to print or downloadthe full text of all of their hits, and then quickly delete them.Since ALL* was designed for downloading, the paging of text isdisabled.ALL* can be entered at three different prompts in the NewsFlash hitdisplay system.If you wish ALL* to operate on all of your folders, enter ALL* at the"Enter foldername, List (existing folders), or RENOTIFY" prompt, thefirst prompt displayed upon entering the NewsFlash hit displaysystem. The full text of all of the hits from all of your folderswill be displayed, and then deleted.ALL* can also be used to operate on all of your folders if you enterALL at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders), or RENOTIFY"prompt, and then enter ALL* at the next prompt, "Enter HEAD for allheadlines or TEXT for all text."If you only wish to view the hits from single folder, first specify afoldername at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders) orRENOTIFY" prompt, and then enter ALL* at the next prompt, "Enter HEAdfor headline; Text for full text..."The order in which hits are displayed, and the type of hits displayed(saved, unviewed, or deleted), using the ALL* command, are determinedby your global options settings and any sort order changes made usingthe SORT command.ALL* can also be used in conjunction with the RETRIEVE command todisplay the full text of all of your saved or deleted hits in aparticular folder.HEAD*The HEAD* command acts in a similar manner to that of the ALL*command, and can be entered at the same prompts. Instead ofdisplaying the full text of the hits and then deleting them as ALL*does, however, HEAD* displays the headlines of all of your hits, andchanges the status of the hits to saved. HEAD* was designed to giveyou a quick index of your hits: you can print or download the entiregroup of headlines quickly, and then re-enter NewsFlash hit displaylater to display full text of selected headlines.DELETE*The DELETE* command was created in order to let you qickly deletelarge groups of hits. DELETE*, which can be entered at the "Enterheadline number(s) to read, ALL, AGain..." prompt, deletes all ofyour remaining hits of the selected type (saved or unviewed), withoutyour having to delete them page by page or having to display them.It's equivalent to the command STOP in the former version ofNewsFlash.Other Command OptionsWhen you access hits from all of your folders, you can bypass the"Enter HEAD for all headlines or TEXT..." prompt that is displayedimmediately after you specify ALL at the "Enter foldername, List(existing folders), or RENOTIFY" prompt. Simply add one of twospecial command options to the ALL command: enter ALL -HEAD, or ALL-TEXT.ALL -HEAD, entered at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders),or RENOTIFY" prompt, displays the headlines of hits from all of yourfolders. ALL -TEXT, similarly, displays the full text of the hitsafrom all of your folders.The command HEAD also supports two options: -BRIEF and -DETAIL. Whenincluded on the same line as the HEAD command, the current headlinedisplay format is changed from the setting specified in your globaloptions to either BRIEF format or DETAILED format. HEAD is thecommand issued to view the headlines of your hits, after you havespecified a foldername or all folders at the "Enter foldername..."prompt first displayed upon entering hit display, or when using theRETRIEVE command to view the headlines of saved or deleted hits.The PAGING command in the new NewsFlash allows the use of fourdifferent command options: -HEAD, -TEXT, -BOTH, -NONE.The command PAGING, followed by any of these four options, can beentered at any prompt in NewsFlash. The -TEXT option causes the fulltext of NewsFlash hits to be displayed on page at a time. EnteringPAGING -HEAD will cause just headlines to be paged. Both headlinesand full text will be paged if you enter PAGING -BOTH, and PAGING -NONE disables paging completely.For More DetailsMore details on all of these commands and command options areavailable in the updated NewsFlash section of the NewsNet UserDocumentation, being mailed to you within the next few weeks, and bycalling NewsNet Customer Service at 800-345-1301 or 215-527-8030.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEWSNET ACTION LETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1990THE NEWSFLASH CONVERSION PROCESS: WHAT YOU'LL SEEIf you're already a NewsFlash user, you may be wondering if yourexisting NewsFlash profile will be compatible with the new NewsFlashsoftware, and if so, how the conversion will take place.The new NewsFlash will be released gradually, a group of subscribersat a time, starting at the end of January.About a week before your NewsFlash profile is scheduled to beconverted, you will receive a call from a NewsNet representative, whocan answer any questions you may have about the conversion process.When your profile has been converted, a special message will bedisplayed automatically upon signon, letting you know that the newNewsFlash is now active for you.Your New FolderSince the new NewsFlash is based upon groupings of keyword phrasescalled "folders," a folder will be placed on your NewsNet account.This folder, called FOLDER0001, will contain converted versions ofyour existing keyword phrases. All hits from your old NewsFlashprofile will also be transferred to this new folder.Logical ChangesIn the current version of NewsFlash, there is only one logicalconnector: the + sign, used between terms to indicate AND. You canalso monitor exact, literal phrases, called "strings", merely byleaving a space between the terms (INTEREST RATE, for example, wouldbe searched by the new NewsFlash as an exact phrase).The new version of NewsFlash supports complete Boolean logic, likethat used with NewsNet's SEARCH command. The connectors AND, OR, andBUT NOT can now be used, as can proximity searching, parentheses, andquotation marks to indicate exact, literal phrases ("INTEREST RATE",for example).The + sign is no longer operative in the new version of NewsFlash,and phrases not enclosed in quotation marks will be treated as theyare in SEARCH: as containing an implied AND connector. INTEREST RATEin the new NewsFlash, for example, will be interpreted as INTEREST ANDRATE.Your existing phrases will be converted automatically to the newlogical scheme: o All + signs will be removed from your phrases, and replaced with the connector AND. o All phrases now used as string searches (INTEREST RATE) will be enclosed in quotation marks ("INTEREST RATE"). o Any incorrect logical connectors accepted by the old NewsFlash (commas, for example) will be removed during the conversion.Check Your PhrasesIt is important that you check your phrases to make sure they havebeen converted correctly. As soon as you receive the signonnotification letting you know that your NewsFlash profile has beenconverted, enter the new NewsFlash set-up system by entering FLASH atNewsNet's main command prompt (Enter command or ).

Saved hits are retained for two days. o After you display unviewed hits, they will be deleted unless you specifically request that they be saved or renewed (returned to unviewed status). o The headlines of your NewsFlash hits will be paged (information will be delivered one screen at a time). Full text of any articles you display will not be paged.Folder Options o Your folder activity status has been set to active, which means that your phrases are being actively monitored. o Your hits are sorted first by issue date, earliest to latest, and then, within that sort, alphabetically by keyword phrase. o Your headlines are shown in brief format, which means that approximately four headlines will be displayed per page of headlines.Phrase Options o Services cross-referenced to the services you are monitoring with NewsFlash will automatically be included. o If you are currently monitoring ALL services, cross-referencing will be set to NOT APPLICABLE. o The maximum number of hits you will receive from a phrase each day is 50.To Change These OptionsAny or all of these option settings can be adjusted to yourspecifications.To change your global option settings, enter FLASH at NewsNet's maincommand prompt (Enter command or ), and then at the nextprompt, enter OPTIONS.

Theseservices were begun when the "mainframe was king"  and  users accessed thesystems through "dumb terminals"  over private telecommunications networksmanaged  by  these companies or   telecommunications  partners. Since thattime  there  have  been  major  changes  in  the  business,  computer  andnetworking industries which have caused evolutionary changes in the onlinefield in  terms of  technology,  networking,  changing  economics  and newadvancements.  Probably  the two  most  significant  impacts  in  the lastquarter century are the emergence of  the international  Internet  and thetremendous price/performance  advancements  in  computer  technology whichbring connectivity and very powerful computer technology  into every levelof the workplace and home.The 'Gale Directory of  Databases',  long considered a "Bible" of databaseselection  and mirror  of  the online  industry,  has listed around 10,000databases from  3,500  database  producers  and  vended  through  over 800online service providers.  Yet, with the emergence of the Internet and lowcost computing,  this measure is losing much meaning.   Literally hundredsof  thousands of  database and  information services are  now available onthe Internet  from  the largest firms to  individuals at  home  using welldocumented and easily  accessible  technology  such as the World  Wide Webthrough which information can be organized and presented.  Everyone admitsthat this  proliferation of  online  services  and tools is  confusing andthere are many poor services on the net,  and yet,  this trend is changingthe  way in  which traditional online  service providers must  address themarket.  Information producers no longer  necessarily need to go  to majoronline vendors for providing wide scale access to  their information [yes,there are still many advantages in doing so] and yet many are  now puttingtheir own online services directly on the Internet.The Evolution of Computers and Networking   *  Low cost access  to the  Internet through myriads  of local Internet   service providers has meant that  the largest companies  to  home users   can contract for connectivity at prices which are scalable to needs.   *  Networking technology can now be purchased in bandwidth chunks which   are scalable  to  local needs.   For  example,  high speed modems (e.g.   28.8  Kbps)  which work over regular phone lines are under $200, easier   access to ISDN [64 Kbps] is available in the home and office,  lowering   costs of leased lines for higher speeds can even  provide T1  speeds at   prices affordable by small businesses.   *  Newer networking technology such as frame relay, ATM and plans being   offered by  cable and phone companies for  optical  fiber  or  TV cable   access to  the Internet  bring the hope  of  even  higher  bandwidth at   affordable prices.   *  Computing power in terms of instructions per  second has experienced   huge growth ... Many PCs and Unix  boxes now have  more computing power   than  supercomputers  of a  decade ago.   Intel's Pentium Pro processor   currently  is  clocked at  200  MHz  and indications are that  the fast   evolution  in processors will  continue.   DEC currently produces a 266   MHz Alpha RISC Chip, Sun Microsystems now has RISC UltraSPARC chips  at   just under 200  MHz,  and  the PowerPC RISC  chips being produced  as a   cooperative venture with Motorola and IBM are in the same  speed range.   Truly phenomenal computing speed is widely available.   *   Hard   disk   storage   technology   has   experienced   the   same   price/performance  improvements  as  the  microprocessor.   It  is  now   difficult to buy disks with less than  1  gigabyte of storage at prices   of just a few hundred dollars.  Many suppliers are commonly offering  1   GB to 9 GB drives at very low costs per byte.   * CD-ROM technology has found its niche in the home market for easy and   cheap distribution  of  games,  databases and application  programs.  A   quad-speed or faster CD-ROM is  now considered a  standard feature with   most PCs.   * Full multimedia on PCs and over the Internet are now commonplace.   * The  operating systems which seem to be dominating the marketplace at   this time are Windows 95  for individual  users,  Windows NT for larger   multiuser database access and Unix.   There has been a dramatic decline   in the use of traditional mainframe operating systems.   *  About 80%  of the local area  network (LAN)  market is  now  held by   Novell.  However,  it  is unclear whether  this will begin to  erode as   multiuser operating systems such as Windows NT may make traditional LAN   technology obsolete.   Clearly, Novell and other LAN developers need to   offer a rich body of features and make their products  easier-to-use to   keep ahead of the Microsoft juggernaut.Evolution of System Features   *  Many companies which began as producers of databases of CD-ROMs have   now  broadened  their  market  to  offering  their  search  engines and   databases for local loading under Unix or Windows NT.  Examples of this   include  SilverPlatter with  their ERL service which  allows  the local   loading  of  databases for multiuser access  under SCO Unix  or Solaris   (Sun's version of Unix)  and they are beta testing a Windows NT version   of  ERL.  Ovid Technologies (formerly called  CDPlus Technologies which   shows their CD-ROM  origins)  is now primarily  distributing its search   engines and databases for local Unix  servers.   Ovid  uses  CD-ROMs to   distribute database  updates which local sites  copy  to  hard  disk to   provide widescale multiuser access.   *  Many companies which originally were not database vendors have moved   into this marketplace because it nicely complements other products they   vend.  For example, many developers of integrated library systems (CARL   Corporation,  Ameritech's  VISTA  System,  Innovative  Interfaces  Inc.   INN-VIEW system,  DRA operates the Open DRA Net service and others) now   centrally mount suites of databases.   Although users of these services   are typically  libraries  which  use  a  particular  integrated library   system,  most of  these  vendors  are  trying  to  make  broader market   penetration. Traditional cataloging utilities such as OCLC, RLG and WLN   have all moved into the database vending market.  Their success in this   is due to  a large existing  customer  base,  and  synergism with other   products  they  offer (e.g.  link to  holdings, ILL/document delivery).   Many publishers and database producers are beginning to offer their own   online services.  Examples include Information Access Company (IAC) who   has its own online system while still licensing its databases  to other   vendors or  individual  sites;  EBSCO has  launched  its  own EBSCOhost   system for offering its databases and those of  others,  Academic Press   is  offering  its entire  family  of  print journals  on  the  Web, and   Elsevier is offering  its huge  journal product in  electronic form for   local loading.   *  Online service providers are augmenting their traditional ASCII text   search  interfaces  with  graphical user interfaces (gui).   Two trends   seem  to  be  predominant -  many vendors are offering  proprietary gui   clients for use with their specific online  system which  are rich with   features;  many online services are now offering  web server  access to   their database servers so that a person can use a standard  web browser   (e.g.  Netscape,  Mosaic, Lynx) to search databases.  Web server access   to database servers is advantageous because one does not  need to worry   about client software distribution and the problems of  illegal copying   of proprietary software.   * Z39.50 client/server compliance is now supported by many major online   services such  as CARL Corporation,  DRA,  Ameritech VISTA, EBSCO, OCLC   FirstSearch, IAC, Innovative Interfaces, Ovid Technologies, RLG Citadel   and SilverPlatter.   Thus users can select  the Z39.50  client of their   choice and have a common  interface to many different  online services.   Clearly this standard is still  rapidly evolving and  Z39.50 clients do   not offer the rich  range of  features  as proprietary  clients and yet   most feel that  the Z39.50  protocol holds great promise.   A number of   Z39.50  clients now offer the ability  to  launch  searches  to several   servers at the same time (e.g. DRA, Search Access).   *  A  "link to  holdings"  feature  is  now  offered  by  some vendors.   Although this can be handled in different  ways,  the main idea is that   when a user  looks at  a bibliographic citation  (if full  text  is not   online) the system indicates if a local library owns the citation. OCLC   and RLG can perform this at the "title level"  for sites who catalog on   their   systems.    Local  ILS  vendors   (e.g.  Ameritech,  Innovative   Interfaces,  DRA)  can often link  to a serial summary  holdings record   assuming the library uses the vendor in question.   Some products allow   a library to create electronic lists of holdings statements  (e.g. IAC)   so that when a citation is retrieved holdings show, and EBSCO indicates   title  level ownership  information  on  its  EBSCOhost  service  if an   organization uses  the EBSCO subscription  services  for  serials. Ovid   Technologies does a Z39.50 call to a local Z39.50 compliant ILS so that   the holdings information is  then  returned and displayed  to the user.   The  link  is  up-to-date  and  does  not  require   the  creation  and   maintenance of a second holdings file.   *  Full scanned images are being commonly delivered by products such as   UMI PowerPages, IAC, EBSCO and others. Full-text ASCII delivery is also   common through vendors such as IAC, EBSCO, LEXIS-NEXIS and others.   *  When full-text is not available online  (in either  ASCII or scanned   images)  most online systems now offer the ability to launch a document   delivery or ILL request.   *  Multilingual support is  now being offered  more  frequently through   PC-based  clients.   This  is  especially  important  with  the diverse   American  culture  and  the  greater  internationalization   of  online   services because of the Internet.   *  Natural  language search interfaces  are appearing on  many consumer   products such as "Homework Helper"  by Infonautics,  Cognito by IAC and   EyeQ by DataTimes.   *  Greater  sophistication  in  mapping natural language  to controlled   vocabulary  is  appearing (e.g.  Ovid has extensive  abilities  in this   area)  and  the ability for users to  interact  authority  or thesaural   files is commonplace.Changing EconomicsProbably the biggest  financial trend in  the online industry in  the lastfive years has been  a growing use of  "flat fee"  pricing  algorithms forlibraries and other institutions.   This originally began in the mid-1980swhen  academic  and  public  libraries  began  to  shift  away  from usingcommercial timesharing services  for high-use databases  and replaced themwith CD-ROMs which could be  licensed for  a flat annual fee.   This trendcontinued to evolve into the local loading of  databases  in institutionaldatabase servers and has now gone full circle to  libraries demanding flatfee pricing from online service providers.   This flat fee pricing throughonline service providers has been challenging since one must get agreementfrom  the  online  vendor  and  the  database  producer.   This  is  oftencomplicated by  factors such as libraries wanting to  subscribe  in groupsthrough consortia.   Online vendors and database producers  have developedmany unique pricing algorithms to maintain revenue while responding to theneed in many institutions for fixed fee pricing so  they  can manage tightbudgets.   The  most  common  algorithm  usually  involves  some  type  ofconcurrent  user  model.   Most libraries,  however, still use many of thecommercial timesharing services for medium and low use databases where theinstitution wants occasional access to many different files.Many vendors are also developing personal pricing strategies in an attemptto provide low cost access to database services over the  Internet for theindividual.   Typically,  these  involve billing or  credit  card paymentswhich an individual can afford  and the vendor  hopes to make a  profit involume.Some  online  services  offer their  search  engine  for  free  if  a sitesubscribes  to  or  locally   loads   some   of   their   databases  (e.g.SilverPlatter, IAC,  most databases from ILS vendors) ... the library onlypays for the  database  subscription.   However,  there  are  some notableexceptions   such  as  Ovid   Technologies   or   OCLC   SiteSearch  whereorganizations are willing to pay a premium for specialized services.ConclusionWith the emergence of the Internet and low-cost high-powered computing theonline industry is in a state of  flux.  Many traditional online providersneed to be flexible to respond to user needs.   Online services need to bepowerful  and yet easy-to-use,  must  be  client-centered,  and  must havepricing options for many different market segments.

GALILEO offers over50  databases using OCLC SiteSearch Z39.50  Server System coupled with theOCLC WebZ software which lets  users access  the system  over the Internetusing standard web browsers.This aggressive  project was spearheaded by William Gray Potter, director,University of  Georgia.   "We wanted full Z39.50  compatibility with a Webbrowser ... We know  we wanted  to  take  a client-server approach  but wedidn't want to be in the business of attempting to distribute and maintaina proprietary client.  And  we  wanted  to provide  ready integration withOCLC's FirstSearch  service.  With  SiteSearch  and  WebZ,  we're  able toperform all these functions."Two parallel SiteSearch systems are being run at the University of Georgiaand  Georgia  State  University  to  distribute  the   load  for   the  34participating institutions.   Some of the databases are locally loaded andsome are offered on a pass-through basis to the FirstSearch system at OCLCin Ohio.  Databases  offered  include  a suite  of   periodical  indexing/abstracting services, an encyclopedia and full-text to over 1,100 journalsfrom EBSCO.High-use files or files of local interest are put on the  local SiteSearchservers while other databases are offered seamlessly  through FirstSearch.In the future,  the  Galileo project  will  offer  scanned  document imagedatabases including the Georgia archives and state documents.

In December 1995, the company announced theavailability of  STAR/Web  which allows  any web  browser  to  access STARdatabases over  the Internet.  STAR/Web uses  a  common  gateway interface(cgi)  program that connects STAR  software to any standard  or commercialWorld  Wide  Web  server   (http  daemon).   With  the  product,  databaseadministrators  can let users of their  Web hosts use a STAR database withany   standard  web  browser,  thus  mitigating  the  need  to  distributeproprietary client software.The STAR system is widely used in libraries,  museums, government agenciesand other organizations who must index print and non-print collections.Some special features of STAR/Web include:   *  System administrators  can design  web pages for full-text  or index   searches that include multiple input boxes.   *  Index displays  on  the assisted  search  screens  help users select   applicable search terms to be pasted into the appropriate input boxes.   *  Administrators  can pre-define  applicable  Boolean,  proximity  and   ranging operators.   * Ordering facilities are supported for document delivery.   *  STAR/Web maintains their "state" in which the user views the initial   search results.   When  users  select  a  hypertext  link, conventional   search engines immediately forget what the user entered as search text.   STAR/Web retains what the user has entered and selected.   *  The product allows  the  system  administrator  to  design  the html   screens and has tools  to present and  sort information to the  user in   many different ways.For more information contact:  Cuadra Associates Inc.,  11835 West OlympicBlvd.,  Los Angeles, CA 90064.

EB'schairman and  president, Joseph  Esposito, was  quoted as  saying the salewould "intensify  its focus  and efforts  in extending  the vast editorialwealth of the  Britannica, as well  as in strengthening  our leadership onthe World Wide Web."CCH Incorporated, a leading provider of tax and business law  information,software, and  services is  being acquired  under an  agreement by WoltersKluwer NV, an international publisher of print and electronic  informationfor  professionals  and  business  for  approximately  $1.9  billion.  Thetransaction places  Wolters Kluwer  in the  position of  being one  of theworld's  largest  and  leading  professional  publishers,  with   combinedanticipated revenues of more than $2.4 billion. The move also provides theDutch company with strengthening its presence in North America.Responsive  Database  Services,  Inc.  (Beachwood,  OH),  producer  of theBusiness &  Industry (tm)  database (B&I),  and headed  by president  DickHarris (formerly the head of Predicasts), has announced its acquisition ofthe News  Services Group  (NSG) of  BIS Strategic  Decisions, Inc. (Luton,England) for an undisclosed sum.  NSG will be renamed Responsive  DatabaseServices,  Ltd.  (RDSL).  With  the  acquisition,  RDSI  will  extend  itslocations  at  which  it  processes  data  for its B&I database. RDSI willinvest  in  the  market  development  of  its RDSI "customized informationservices"  used  by  major  companies  throughout  the  world.  RDSI  alsopublishes topical newsletters in the information technology field such  as'IT Today', and 'IT Focus'.ISI has announced its introduction of the company's new line of  Internet-delivered  alerting  services  called  "Research  Alert  Direct" (tm) (RAD(tm)). Six end-user desktop product packages will be introduced:  "JournalTracker"  (tm),   "Personal  Alert"   (tm),  "Professional   Alert"  (tm),"Corporate Alert" (tm), "Topics Select"  (tm), and "Focus On". All  of theRAD products  are drawn  from ISI's  multidisciplinary database  searchingover 16,000 leading international  science, social sciences and  arts, andhumanities  journals,  books,  and  proceedings.  RAD  provides   current,complete bibliographic information that matches a user's profile. The  newproduct offering will become available in the first quarter of 1996.Cambridge  Scientific  Abstracts  has  recently  signed  an agreement withSilverPlatter  Information  to  license  SilverPlatter's ERL technology tobuild  37  abstract  journal  databases  which  will  be  accessible usingSilverPlatter's SPIRS. The  databases will be  mounted on CSA's  server inBethesda, Maryland,  and will  be available  for customers  to access  viaCSA's Internet Database Service (IDS).It was quite a few years ago that we envisioned "erasable optical  discs".That  vision  has  eluded  many,  primarily  because  the cost of magneticstorage (which -is- erasable) came  down dramatically in price. (The  costof a 1 Gigabyte  drive is now about  $300.) Then came WORM  CD-ROM drives,CDR - and now HDCD (High Density CD). Users who bought single speed CD-ROMdrives in the late eighties soon found that double-speed (2x) drives  werenow required  for many  applications, such  as multimedia.  Now 4x  CD-ROMdrives  are  common  and  8x  drives  are just being introduced. Differingstandards  by   different  manufacturers   all  helped   to  quash  CD-ROMdevelopment  over  the  past  years.  Now  new  light  has  shone with theagreement on standards  by major worldwide  CD-ROM manufacturers both  forhigh density CD,  and truly erasable  CD-ROMs. -- But  will we be  able toafford it?While Microsoft's  Windows 95  made a  splashy debut  in 1995, Microsoft'sdecision to use 16-bit technology instead of 32-bit reflects the fact thatmost 16-bit online and  PC users still represent  the bulk of the  market.That  was  Gates'  hedge  on  making  sure  the  product would sell - alsorecognizing the fact  that not everyone  is as eager  to hand out  dollarsjust to be the "first kid on the block" with the new technology. Ditto  onIntel's Pentium chip which  cannot significantly utilize its  higher speedfor the majority of Windows 95 users.Development of the Internet is probably a good reflection and  measurementof just how much technology can race ahead of users. There is currently  arush for virtually everyone and every company and organization  throughoutthe world  to get  on the  World Wide  Web (ourselves included). Software,browsers, databases, services,  email - and  you name it  - abound on  theInternet. Unfortunately, for online and PC users, not all of the  productsare compatible with -your- system, and  tech support can soak up a  lot ofuser time (whether it's  for free or -fee-).  -- All said however,  onlineand PC users -should-  use the Internet as  an indicator of the  advancingtechnology - as it is happening!We are all looking forward to  1996 to see just what new  developments arecoming down the information superhighway - not to mention that we'd prefernot to have our pockets picked along the way.

Quietly (very quietly), a consortium of five major ADVANCE NOTES. Quietly (very quietly), a consortium of five major film/camera companies have been working together to come up with a new type of camera and film to meet the competition from the digital arena. In February they'll be unveiling their product to the photography industry. Using new technology ranging from magnetic strips on film, to printed information on the back of pictures, the new system, called APS (Advanced Photo System), is bound to attract general consumers and eventually professionals. Here's our two-part report:--------------------------------------------------------Step aside CD-ROM...Back to Headline List CopyrightPHOTO STOCK NOTES via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FILM FOREVER !Film and camera manufacturers know where the big dollar is. With your average consumer. These companies have secretly engineered a new film/camera product that is aimed at holding the deep foothold they have dug in the consumer industry. To keep these customers, they've in essence invented a new picture-taking method: the Advanced Photo System (APS).Back to Headline List CopyrightPHOTO STOCK NOTES via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996WHEN YA CAN'T FIGHT 'EMLong-time foes, KODAK and FUJI, plus three other entries (Nikon, Canon, and Minolta) have formed a consortium over the last five years in an attempt to secretly counter the obvious commercial threat to them from digital photography. The result of their efforts is a dream come true for anyone who isn't interested in f-stops, lighting formulae, flash factors, color balances, and all the complexities photography instructors build their careers on. The five companies will introduce the Advance Photo System to the world in February, and the system will be in stores by early spring.Some highlights:FILM. It'll be 24mm wide negative film, not transparencies. Exposures of 14,25, and 40. You won't get it back from the processor in those fingerprint-prone strips anymore. The rolled film will return in its original cassette. And you won't get blank film back if you loaded it wrong.  You can't load it wrong.CONTACT SHEETS. You'll get back postcard-size sheets with miniature, numbered, color pictures on them, ready to select for print-making. There'll be no wasteful volume printing of everything on the roll. Instead, you'll select customized sizes for your pictures of top priority.PRINTS. By pushing a button on the camera, you'll be able to encode on the film what eventual print sizes you want for specific shots, ranging from full-frame to panoramic views.QUALITY. Overexposure and underexposure will be no longer be a problem, or at least, will be negligible. A beeper on your camera will ask you if you are trying to be creative or if you've made a wrong aperture decision.AUDIO. On the more advanced systems, you'll get "film with smarts." The magnetic strip on the film will store spoken instructions and other data.CAPTIONS. The magnetic strip will also automatically store information about the exposure, location, species, genus, model names and releases, or historical data. Your film processor can use the stored data to make exposure adjustments, on a frame-by-frame basis. You'll also get details (if you want them) printed out on the back of each finished picture.PRICE. Film will be in the normal price ranges. Cameras will cost from $25 for a throw-away to big bucks for the sophisticated models.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Ten years ago, who would've thought you could make the Evening News?  Well, not you, but the footage from your camcorder. It's possible today. We see it all the time.We, the people, are all becoming reporters of the world around us. As a stock photographer, you have an inside avenue to the markets where your pictures are sold. New technology, both digital and film, is making it easier to record, catalog, and later transmit your images. Not just to the local media, but worldwide. The new Advanced Photo System (APS) portends to expand this influence of stock photography. Fasten your seat belts, the ride into the next century of photo illustration is going to be exciting.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -It's expected the new APS will take a few years to become accepted by the public. One hurdle: everyone seems to have a 35-mm camera. The cassettes for APS are not adaptable to standard 35mm cameras. And there's always the uncomfortable echo of past attempts to rejuvenate the sluggish consumer photography industry. Remember the "disk cameras" of a decade ago?Here at PhotoSource International we see the APS system as a potentially excellent transition technology for both stock photographers and photobuyers. New companies will licence the technology and offer improvements and peripherals. Although the APS is aimed initially at the consumer market, as it matures, advancements will evolve as user-friendly technology fit for professionals and flow well with paralleling advancements in digital imagery. -RENEXT MONTH:  "APS, The Photobuyers Are Going To Love It."-----Back to Headline List CopyrightPHOTO STOCK NOTES via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996For Stock Photographers....THE INTERNET AS A WHOLE, IS A HOLEThe Internet last year as a whole doubled in size.  Or rather, as a hole.  It's a deep pit for the unwary stock photographer.  If there's any substantive commerce for independent stock photographers on the Internet, I'd like to hear about it.What I read and hear about are Internet products, books, courses, WEB Sites, peripherals, consultant software, training, conferences, chats, and all other varieties of the Medicine Show.  Everyone's gearing up to learn, but where are the sales?C'mon.  Someone please step forward and tell us they've found the Internet to be a more cost-effective way to make sales than through conventional methods.The single action I see on the Internet is by amateur art directors who are on fishing trips, trying to reel in Clip Art prices from uninformed photographers.Step aside, television, we have a new pencil sharpener, a new waste land for procrastinators.  We've gone beyond the word processing merry-go-round, Oprah, Rush, and headphones.  Now it's the Internet.In Mark Twain or Walt Whitman's era, when writers wanted to procrastinate, they'd sharpen pencils.  The writer would get up from the desk and grind away at the pencil sharpener in an attempt to look like something of substance was getting accomplished.  Then television took over as aider and abetter to procrastinators.Net potatoes today find the Internet an escape.So far, the Internet can hardly be called a highway of productivity.  An hour surfing the Internet is foolishly spent on time you could be advancing your stock photography career.  The Internet as a highwayhas no stop lights, speed limits, guard rails, or accident prevention--just toll booths.The Internet for stock photographers is populated by inexperienced people using tools that haven't reached maturity. But it is pumped up by professionals--marketing professionals who know how to take an empty thoroughfare and turn it into the glamour and glitter of Las Vegas.  Listen to the rhetoric.  Put a blindfold on and substitute the word "Used Car" for "Internet" and you'll recognize familiar hype.But take heart, it's coming.  Many interesting things can be found at the bottom of a pit:  gold, diamonds, ancient coins, even crude oil!However, don't fall into the pit without some tools to get yourself back out, as well as a plan to mine the pit.  You can join those ever-present pioneers who are ready to descend into any pit on the chance of ascending to greater heights.  I applaud them.We talk by phone and fax with dozens of photobuyers each week in the course of our photo listing gathering here at PhotoSource International.  Photobuyers in the magazine and book world tell us they are not available on the Internet and don't plan to be soon.  If this changes, we'll be the first to let you know. -REEd. Note: Be sure to read "The Internet: Thumbs Down -- Ten good reasons for stock photographers to stay out of the net."  PhotoStockNotes, Pg. 1, March '95.Back to Headline List CopyrightPHOTO STOCK NOTES via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996A NEW KIND OF HIGHWAY BRIGANDThe scene is a court room.  The judge, with gavel in hand, has just heard a stock photographer plead his case.  The defendant, an art director at a mid-size ad agency, has been accused of "borrowing" part of the photographer's photo and using it in an ad campaign.The gavel comes down.  The judge rules for the photographer and glares at the ad agency art director.  "You willfully stole part of this photographer's picture.  I'm going to fine you within the full extent of the law, $750, the price you would have had to pay for this photo if you had acquired it through appropriate business channels."The ad agency director smiles."What?"  The photographer gasps.  "You mean someone can steal my photos and use them for free and if they get caught all they have to pay is the price they would have paid anyway for the photo if they would have gone through regular channels?""I'm afraid that's the way the Copyright Law presently reads," says the judge."Yet I have to pay my attorney, and court costs, and all my downtime, about $3500, that it took to pursue my rights in this case???"Gavel comes down again.  "Next case!"  says the judge.                   MODERN-DAY BRIGANDS    The photographer in this case could be you.  Digital technology already makes it very easy for art directors to "borrow" images and portions of images from magazines, catalogs, posters, or original art, and use them for their own purposes.  They know that litigation is too costly for an individual photographer.  The information highway is producing a new kind of robber, the digital image thief.As we travel down the information highway, no other profession will be as vulnerable to thievery as ours.  Parts of pictures can be stolen with little or no detection.And even if you detect it, it doesn't matter whether you can prove that part of your photo was pilfered.  If by some remarkable chance a thief is found out, the way the law is interpreted now, unless the image has formal copyright registration protection, the robber gets away without punishment.  And he's free to continue to roam the highway, picking off victims at will.  Few photographers formally register every one of their pictures (at $20 per).In medieval days, when vandals roamed the countryside, the populace depended on the Baron and his castle for protection.  In a sense, individuals were torn between the evils of vandals and the corruptions of land barons.                        __________              "...the ease of picking out parts of digital images is too irresistible to digit pickers..."                        ----------Not until citizens gained individual rights and legal protection, did real freedom become reality.As individual stock photographers, we have been knocked back to medieval times.  Digital imagery has done this to us.  The ease of picking out parts of digital images is too irresistible to digit pickers at graphic houses and ad agencies.Large stock agencies, with their financial resources, no doubt may set some precedents and win a few court battles against the digital vandals.  But the message to commercial art directors will be:  "If you see an image you want, make sure it doesn't belong to a large stock agency or a digital service bureau.  Instead prey on the individual photographer who will never be able to afford to fight us."For photographers, the message will be:  "I'd better give up my individuality and go with a large stock agency (the Baron in the Castle) so he can protect me."We need a Pied Piper, someone who will lead us away from the digital vandals, and away from the Barons who offer us protection but sometimes at the cost of our creative freedom.  We need someone who will set a precedent with the Copyright Office and establish painful repercussions in the graphics community for any pilfering of an image or parts of an image, whether the original belongs to a massive stock agency, a small stock agency, or Jane Doe producing individual photos from her cabin in Montana.Back to Headline List CopyrightPHOTO STOCK NOTES via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996DIGITS IS MONEYEventually, the banking industry will be completely digitized.  Already, here at the farm as one example, most of our revenue the form of credit card payments (digits). We use a Control Data program called TELEMONY to deposit these digits, and the digits end up in our bank via the Federal Reserve.We also offer a program for "automatic checks," called Check-O-Matic, for persons who are not into credit cards. Our bank talks electronically to the bank where their have there checking account (digits).Photos are getting digitized too. Eventually, the stock photo industry will be completely digitized.MONEY IN THE BANKIt can be said that digitized photos and digitized money are becoming synonymous, and that if you have a bank of photos, then you have money in the bank.Commerce is conducted when there's an exchange of money (digits).However, the stock photo industry today, as well as the rest of the commercial community, face the same hurdles to achieve security systems that the banking industry faced 35 years ago when electronic transfer of money (digits) was introduced.Over the past three decades, banks have produced an effective (secure) system for transferring digits.  No secure system exists yet for photos (or text), or finaicial transactions in the open marketplace.Several commercial companies are focusing enery and dollars to solve their security problems, and some even do boast of having "secure" systems on the Internet.  One such firm is Netscape--but two announcements last year of "holes" in the Netscape Navigator have Internet merchants scurrying for an explanation. In one case, two Berkeley students cracked the program's security code and publicized their finding on the Internet.By the way, if you are a programmer with a hacker's mentality and are looking for a gainful programming position, the best way to get to the head of the line is to crack the Internet and publicize your findings.  Industry will scoop you up and employ your talents. -RE-----Back to Headline List CopyrightPHOTO STOCK NOTES via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UPDATELESSInevitable: Death, Taxes, and Updates. There's no getting around it, updates of your software is now a fact of our digital lives. A visit to the library to look over some 1980's computer magazines and you wonder how we could've been so naive in those days.

Bergerson.ASMP and several other groups concerned with intellectual properties have attempted to introduce sensible changes to the Copyright Act, but with little success so far.  Photographers would like to see changes in Sections 104(a), 405, 406, 408(a) and 412(2), which require that an individual photograph be formally registered within three months after publication or before an infringement problem comes up in order to be eligible for full legal recourse.Currently it's not feasible for photographers to go through the formal                        - - - - - - - - - - -                     "Legislation always lags                      far behind technology...."                       - - - - - - - - - - -registration process for each photo (and at $20 a crack), in order to protect themselves "just in case," so that they're eligible to receive statutory damages in the event infringement happens.  This requirement needs to be abolished in order to eliminate the loophole for digital thievery as presented in the theoretical case above."We know that copyright changes are coming.  But Congress is trying to find answers for questions that haven't been asked yet," says Bergerson.  "Electronic transmission of images is presenting a new playing field.

Relatively recent law changes drastically tightened the rules on deductions for casualty theft losses. It is now much more difficult to qualify for tax relief when you suffer property damage of your photography equipment. The damage must be the result of an auto accident, fire, flood, vandalism, storm, theft, or some other event that is sudden, unexpected, or unusual in nature. Even in these circumstances there are restrictions.Both the past and present rules allow write-offs for uninsured losses on property used for personal purposes only if you itemize your deductions.  Another restriction imposed by the old and current rules is that you cannot deduct the first $100 of loss from any casualty or theft incident.Julian Block, a former IRS agent and tax attorney, is the author of "JulianBlock's Tax Avoidance Secrets" (560 pages) $33.95 (3 Washington Sq, LarchmontNY 10538-2032).

You've probably experienced the same thing when surfing the variety of TV channels you now have available to you: "There's nothing on TV anymore. Unless you want to watch the cat and dog show competition in Bulgaria." Human nature dictates that the more choices we have, the less satisfied we are.  (Ignorance is bliss.)In the business world, the law of supply and demand takes over. A weekly cat and dog show from Bulgaria wouldn't last long if there were 1.) no viewers, and 2.) no sponsors. REALITY: If the show survives, it's because there's a market for it.Where do you fit in? As a photo illustrator in the new generation of stock photography, the speedy delivery of text and images makes the global market a goldmine for you, if you specialize.THE KEY:  FRAGMENTATIONThe fragmentation of information will work in your favor. No longer will photobuyers be seeking a picture of a cat. They'll want a White Manx or an Abyssinian silver male cat. If you have a way with cats and love photographing them, you will become an important resource to a book publisher in Singapore who is producing a coffee table book on Black Persian cats.To the rest of us, such photo requests will seem way out in left field, much the same as we feel about the arcane selection of shows we see listed on cable TV these days. But to you, the specialist in cats of the Near East, the photo request will be right down your alley. You'll make not only a sale, but a new contact to add to your cluster of buyers that you can count on for sales in the years ahead.THERE'S HOPEDoes the trend toward specialization mean we are coming to a static resting place in our development as stock photographers? Bottleneck problems result when we acquire massive amounts of information, but have no speedy system to process, transmit, or filter it. But, as is happening in many of the medical sciences, electronics, and even molecular biology (using DNA as its model), our paths along specialized routes may all converge into one gigantic ballroom where we would capitalize on the quick delivery of information. Inventions such as molecular computers may one day be the solution. Locating and transmitting pictures will be as quick as turning the page in this newsletter. In the meantime, it's all about putting bread on the table, and fragmentation is the key.NEXT:   NICHE MARKETINGBack to Headline List CopyrightPHOTO STOCK NOTES via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HIGHWAY HEADLIGHTSAs the I-Way begins to build, keep your eye on the movers and shakers who are developing stock photo sites.

But a monopoly, it is not. When Corbis Media is at full capacity, it will represent perhaps about 1% of the images on this planet. It is no more going to put you out of business than your local lending library is going to put newspaper, magazine and book publishers out of business.The impact from libraries has been the reverse:  More books are being bought today. 10,000 new publishers are signing up for ISBN's (the i.d. #'s in the book industry) each year.  Last year there were 119,000 new titles published and over a million books printed.There's no such thing as monopoly culture when it comes to communicating.Vast libraries like Corbis, KPX\Sprint, PNI and any future ones that may enter the scene are essentially storehouses of generalized photos. These Goliaths aren't geared to collect deep files on every subject, every topic, every corner of the world.For that reason, photobuyers will turn to their "specialty shops" - you - when they want expertise in a subject and depth of coverage for greater choice, to offer their readers exceptional, insightful photography - which after all, sells books and magazines. -RE.-----Back to Headline List CopyrightPHOTO STOCK NOTES via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996TRAVELERS ABROAD:Photographers: We broadcast your foreign destinations along with your phone/fax number, departure date, length of stay, etc. Photobuyers watch this column.

Eventually he migrated to the East coast where his western style of ski shooting was in great demand.

The "siege" of the New York Times by freelance writers and their organizations (to protect writers' rights to appropriate payment) continues to attract attention.Along parallel lines, a year ago, TIME Inc. announced a policy covering freelance photography that included electronic rights issues unacceptable to ASMP, PP of A and other photo groups.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Some of TIME Inc.'s periodicals began mailing new freelance contracts that did not demand electronic rights, and promised royalties for electronic use starting in 1998; demanding, however, free use until then.  Multi more protests later, the magazines have reportedly again revised their contracts, dropping CD-ROM's from the electronic use clause and adding small up front payments to cover online use until royalties begin.The American Society of Journalists and Authors (we are members) continues to follow the New York Times Rights Grab.

The numbers of 'hits' are always large (15,000, 150,000, etc.). The numbers are impressive until you realize these aren't sales, or even prospects. They're curious people, window shoppers.Here at PhotoSource International, we've been photographed and featured in several major magazines--TIME Magazine (a half page photo), POPULAR PHOTOGRAPHY, MONEY, USA TODAY (quarter page photos), CHANGING TIMES (on the cover).  Each person that read these articles could be considered the same type of 'hit.' This adds up to several million 'hits' over the years. Here's where you get the difference between advertising and publicity. While this kind of exposure is beneficial for the big picture and long term--does it result in sales today? Were we able to covert any of the inquiries? Few. Most were window shoppers.

Earlier this year, Index Stock already pioneered on-line transactions on CompuServe, a commercial on-line service. Index Stock's on-line database, Photos To Go, offers medium-resolution images (about 2 MB) for personal and in-house use in the $15 to $20 price range.  According to Index Stock's Kathy Mullins, "West Stock's Muse site appears to be offering high-quality, 'catalog' grade images. In contrast, we've kept our Photos To Go images separate from our premium line of catalog images."Muse provides two on-line resolutions for previewing:  A thumbnail image and watermarked JPEC image that is about 3.5" x 5" at 72 dpi.  Images for lease are offered in the 1.1 MB size and the 4.5 MB size, which are similar to Kodak PhotoCD's "Base" resolution and "BaseX4" resolutions, respectively.  Muse offers "affordable pricing" in five categories:  Personal ($8-$15); internal Business Printed, i.e. newsletters ($15-$46); external Business Printed, i.e. brochures ($20-$70); non-resale Electronic, i.e. Web pages or presentations ($25-$30); and resale Electronic, i.e. interactive CD-ROM software ($40-$45).Picture Network International (PNI) has been operating a commercial on-line site for about two years.  Besides offering over 350,000 images from 40 suppliers (mostly stock agencies), their Publishers Depot site also offers works of art (from Christies of the UK), historical images, illustrations and type fonts.  PNI has been securing digital images and electronic-use rights (with contracts lasting up to seven years) from many top stock agencies over the past two years.  Now they are offering 5-year interactive CD-ROM licenses for as low as $40, for production runs under 20,000; and Publishing on Demand (under 5,000 copies) for as low as $30 (18 megabyte files are $100).  Although PNI does not offer instant transactions like West Stock's Muse site, they claim to provide delivery by writeable CD-ROM or on-line delivery within 24 hours.Royce Bair is director of THE STOCK SOLUTION, a PACA-member stock photo agencyin Salt Lake City, Utah.

Anyone is free to copy those elements.  Only the "expression" in a work is protected.However, if protected "expression" elements of a photo are copied and then transformed by the copier into something that is not recognizable as the original work, technically, this is still copyright infringement (because it is an unauthorized exercise of the copyright owner's exclusive reproduction right - even if the copy has been transformed into something very different.)  In addition, transforming the copy to a new and different work may also be an infringement of the copyright owner's exclusive right to modify the protected work.Practically speaking, though, it can be both costly and difficult for the copyright owner  to prove infringement in this type of case.  Copyright infringement is generally established in court by proving that the defendant's work is "substantially similar" to the copyrighted work.  If the copyright owner's work and the defendant's work are not similar, the copyright owner will not be able to prove infringement unless the defendant actually admits to having copied the protected work.J.

Applying this to camera production, vendors have learned that indeed the megabucks are with mass products for the general consumer, not the showcase elite products aimed at professionals.As we move into digital delivery of pictures, however, I see manufacturers ignoring this time-tested axiom.In the race to capture the Digital Image Industry (and it must be an important one if Apple, Microsoft, Kodak, Fuji, Sony, IBM, and all the other brothers have jumped in), I will make a prediction that the technology that will win out, will be Phd Technology.  (Phd = Push Here Dummy).Every bell and whistle you add to something makes it more complicated for the operator.  When sales dip, manufacturers put their engineers to work to simplify, simplify, and make equipment easier to use.  We've seen this happen in our generation with cameras, automobiles, and telephones.As photographers move onto the I-Way, computer technology will no doubt give way to Interactive Video technology, with all the latter's one finger 'touch screen' push-button ease of operation.  If you plan on providing a service for photobuyers on the I-Way you'll appeal to them and win over the competition if your buyers can reach you with one finger (digit). -REBack to Headline List CopyrightPHOTO STOCK NOTES via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996A WORKABLE SYSTEMWe all like to avoid work.  Unfortunately, few endeavors exist that don't entail some work."Stay out of my darkroom!" the photographer says.  Or, "Stay out of my kitchen!" the chef says.  What they are saying to us is, "I've developed a routine.  I, alone, understand it.  I know where everything is.  If you come in and disturb my routine -- you'll make more work for me."Since the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of most of the activities we involve ourselves in -- housekeeping, driving daily to work, child rearing, marketing our photo illustrations -- we find ourselves attempting to develop a system to get through the nitty gritty tasks that contribute to the success of the main endeavor.  A system, once we perfect it, eventually becomes a habit.  As the saying goes, "You can get used to anything."  Once we form the habit (even the task of meeting the rush hour traffic) it eases the pain.  The unpleasantness of tasks we must accomplish in order to `get through the day' can always be eased by developing a system that works for you.Some of us "develop" our `systems' by leaving ourselves to the mercy of chance.  We let outside pressures ("do it or else") or inside pressures ("I am consumed by my desires") take over.  We sometimes succeed despite the odds. The burn-out rate associated with this approach is high, however.A system, to be good, has to be tempered.  A very dear friend of mine, a German photographer, who introduced me to the camera back in 1956, was a perfectionist in his photography and his darkroom.  Not even his wife was allowed to be present when he was working.  He served up a stress-filled life for himself, and his heart attack in 1975 was not a surprise.  Another friend, a brilliant photographer who coached me in photo illustration back in 1964, allowed inner pressures to build intolerably and he took his own life in 1981.  A system has to be tempered.Unfortunately, much press is given to the artist with a cataclysmic lifestyle whose angst is supposedly the source of his genious. Successful artists who have had happy childhoods and create a healthful and smooth lifestyle don't make for interesting reading.  But there are hundreds of chipper and balanced artists out there who can serve as role models - and examples of having hammered out their own systems for success in living as well as their art.Because you have been blessed (or plagued!) with the gift of creativity, you have the added challenge of working out a system not only for your personal family situation, but your life of creativity as well.  Over the years, I have observed that the majority of artists who survive intact are not those who got there by sheer `talent,' or who moved forward mainly on the nervous energy of their "burning desire" (both elements are, of course, important) -- but rather those who tempered these elements into a manageable lifestyle and built a system that worked, for them.Rohn Engh is Director of PhotoSource International and Publisher of PhotoStockNotes.-----Back to Headline List WT03-B10-39IA087-000629-B026-179http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/pb04.html 205.156.212.5 19970122042027 text/html 31599HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:18:32 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:29 GMTContent-length: 31412Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/pb04.html Sample Issue Copyright PUBLIC BROADCASTING REPORT via NewsNet January 12, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES * LATEST NEWS * FOUR CANDIDATES SIGN ON AS PBS GEARS UP FOR NATIONAL ISSUES CONVENTION (575 words) WASHINGTON DEBATE NO LONGER ABOUT ZEROING OUT PTV -- DUGGAN (1010 words) CPB AWARDS $8.4 MILLION FOR READY TO LEARN INITIATIVES (510 words) QED COMMUNICATIONS HIRES FIRM TO LOBBY ON PTV STATION SALES LEGISLATION (534 words) * PBR NOTES * Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on (344 words) Contributions from state govts. and state universities and (107 words) PBS Pres.

More importantly,staffers for key Republican candidate Sen. Dole (R-Kan.) have toldpress that he won't be attending.  President Clinton, whosescheduled revolves around completion of budget talks, hasn't madeup his mind whether to attend, and his appearance live or bysatellite likely depends on budget negotiations scheduled toreconvene Jan. 17.     Spokeswoman for NIC said Republican hopefuls Lamar Alexander,Richard Lugar, Steve Forbes and Sen. Gramm (R-Tex.) all have agreedto answer questions live before group of representatives fromacross U.S. who will spend days prior taking part in deliberativepoll -- discussing and studying issues before going to candidateswith their concerns.  Alexander and Gramm will take part viasatellite, spokeswoman said.  She said Sen. Dole hasn't told NICthat he won't attend and planners still are hopeful they can findway for him to participate.  NIC planners said discussions alsocontinue with White House on securing Democratic presence at event. James Fishkin, chmn. of govt. dept. at U. of Tex. and NIC exec.dir., said organizers hope "that all of the candidates  -- bothDemocrat and Republican -- will realize the importance of thisopportunity."  He called poll "democracy at work," putting "entirecountry in one room for an open dialogue on the subjects thatmatter to many of us."     Staffers at MacNeil-Lehrer Productions, which is producingconvention for air on PBS, have invited other "policymakers" and"opinion makers" in case Clinton, Dole and others can't attend,spokeswoman said.  Names of those invited weren't disclosed.  Shesaid even if originally-planned cast of candidates don't all showup, NIC participants -- all 600 -- still will get to take part innation's first major deliberative poll, which will show whatcitizens think about issues as they become more informed about themthrough discussions in small groups as well as with candidates andother opinion shapers.     Citizen participants, making up representative sample of U.S.,are scheduled to arrive in Austin Jan. 18 to begin their groupdiscussions, which will be led by trained moderators provided byNational Issues forum, non-partisan network of citizenorganizations that regularly hold deliberative forums on wide rangeof issues.  Discussion guides prepared by Public Agenda andKettering Foundation will serve as briefing materials.  Allmaterials have been reviewed by bipartisan committee of formergovt. officials.     Discussions with candidates will air live on PBS stations Jan.20-21.  Jim Lehrer of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer will moderatebroadcasts, which will be simulcast on NPR.  Wrap-up program Jan.26 will feature highlights and analysis of NIC.  Poll, developed byFishkin, will measure participants' attitudes and opinions beforeand after NIC to quantify impact of deliberative process,organizers said.  NIC will focus on 3 broad issue areas:  economy,state of American family, U.S. role in post-Cold War world.  Finalbroadcast Jan. 26 will reveal poll's results.     NIC is major component of PBS's The Democracy Project, newmultimedia initiative for news and public affairs programming thatwill extend beyond election year.  PBS Pres. Ervin Duggan said heexpects NIC will bring "much-needed perspective" to campaign dialogas well as "launch an exciting year of presidential electioncoverage on public television."Back to Headline List CopyrightPUBLIC BROADCASTING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996WASHINGTON DEBATE NO LONGER ABOUT ZEROING OUT PTV -- DUGGAN     PASADENA, Cal. -- Public broadcasters are "confident about ourfuture," and debate in Washington no longer is about "zeroing out"noncommercial service but how best to continue funding it,according to PBS Pres. Ervin Duggan.  At TV critics tour, he saiddebate turnaround doesn't mean industry has become "complacent orcomfortable" and that PBS is proud of "the often controversialprogramming we offer."     Speaking of PBS accomplishments during 1995, Duggan said itwas "a tumultuous year, a time more exciting than we would want itto have been."  While commercial stations lost audience, PBSremained steady, Duggan said, with 81.7% of American homes tuningto PTV in Oct.  Among successes, Duggan said, were Home VideoCatalog, "a tremendous success" that went to 6 million Americans; PBS online, which he said has been "tremendous boost to ourmission";  partnership with Reader's Digest, which will bring PTV$75 million over next 5 years;  "audience acclaim" received by PBSprogramming in general.     Among concerns, Duggan said, was drop in corporateunderwriting for PTV programming.  Noncommercial TV receives 86% ofits funding from private sources, only 14% from govt., he said.  Asfor proposal some stations have made to Congress to let publicstations advertise products, "the objective truth" is that viewersand large majority of stations don't want it, Duggan said:  "Thelast thing the media world needs is one more commercial channel." There would be net loss in income if advertising is added becauseof drop in corporate and member contributions, he predicted.     As for future of govt. funding, Duggan said noncommercialgroups have submitted 11 proposals to Congress and he wouldn't pickout any one measure as favorite.  Among them was proposed tax ontransfer of commercial stations, which Duggan said would be "justtiny" fraction of total sales price.  National public broadcastingorganizations, including PBS, currently are pushing proposal thatwould allow public stations to lease or sell excess advanced TVspectrum to capitalize multi-billion dollar trust fund that wouldreplace govt. funding.  While Duggan refused to endorse proposal torequire commercial stations to air 3 hours weekly of educationalchildren's programming, he praised "courage and determination" ofFCC Chmn. Hundt in bringing issue before public.  In comments toFCC, PBS had proposed credit for commercial stations that paid forproduction of educational children's programming by publicbroadcasters.     On subject of enhanced underwriting for PBS programming,Duggan said:  "I'm perfectly happy with that.  We do believe thatenhancing the underwriting message is permissible and we know fromour... research that the audience does not object to that."  Hestressed that programming isn't interrupted:  "We have no appealsto buy [something].  We have no product pitches... It might beplaying fast and loose with reality to say that we are movingcloser to commercializing" with enhanced announcements.     PBS said it plans more than 100 hours of primetime programmingcovering 1996 presidential campaign.  Titled The Democracy Project,effort will be headed by Ellen Hume, former Washingtoncorrespondent for Wall St. Journal and N.Y. Times.  Among programsplanned is So You Want to Buy a President, scheduled for Jan. 20broadcast, which PBS expects to be controversial and willinvestigate high cost of national campaigns.     PBS has been looking for programming head since JenniferLawson resigned last spring in midst of management skake-up.  Majorproblem in picking successor, Duggan told us, is that people PBShas interviewed are making more than $700,000 in commercial TV --much more than PBS is willing to pay.  Kathy Quattrone has beenfilling post on acting basis and she was one of many unable totravel to southern Cal. to meet with critics because of blizzard inNortheast.  Also unable to get to Pasadena were Peter, Paul andMary, who star in PBS program and were scheduled to entertain.  Atclosing PTV session last night (Tues.), several TV critics alsohadn't made it to Cal., because of weather.     PBS announced several new programming ventures at tour,including new shows on politics, religion, nature.  Among newprograms will be Bill Moyers series of 10 shows on stories inBible's Book of Genesis.  During Genesis:  A Living Conversationwith Bill Moyers, Moyers and group of people from various religiousbackgrounds will discuss such topics as Adam and Eve and Redemptionand Noah and the Flood.     PBS also announced new slate of David Attenborough specialsfrom BBC, led by 10-part series, World of Birds, for air in 1999. Third season of David Attenborough's Natural World -- made up of 10half-hour explorations of volcanoes, piranhas, butterflies, others-- begins in 1997.  Also that year, PBS will feature 6 newAttenborough hour-length animal specials featuring wolves, polarbears, chimpanzees.  Specials will be part of Nova and Natureseries.     Also promoted at tour was new American Experience episodes,including 3-hour biography Reagan, produced by WGBH-TV Boston, andGreat Performances presentation of Les Miserables in Concert.  LesMiserables was recorded last year at Britain's Royal Albert Halland is scheduled to air during March pledge drive.     Opening lunch on first day of TV critics tour in Pasadena Jan.8 was hosted by PBS, featuring its 4-part miniseries "SavageSkies," on the weather.  Unfortunately, blizzard out of East Coastskies meant many of principals who were to appear to answerreporters' questions were unable to get from N.Y. to Cal.  Seriesis being produced by WNET N.Y.-Newark.  It premieres May 6 on PBS,will be funded by Marsh & McLellen Cos.     Public stations were up first at tour, and no money problemsfor PTV were in evidence as many gifts and meals rivaled in qualityand quantity those given by commercial networks.  For example, eachreporter received 4 T-shirts promoting different PTV programs.     Duggan took advantage of his appearance at tour to host Jan.9 dinner in Bel Air for prominent figures in arts and creativecommunities.  Among those attending were studio, corporate andagency executives.  Dinner honored Beverly Sills, chmn. of N.Y.Lincoln Center who appeared before critics earlier in day.Back to Headline List CopyrightPUBLIC BROADCASTING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996CPB AWARDS $8.4 MILLION FOR READY TO LEARN INITIATIVES     CPB, in what it called "one of the most ambitious efforts todate to harness the power of public television to teach," hasawarded $8.4 million to fund 2 new daily series for children and 2accompanying weekly series for parents.  Programs, scheduled tobegin airing in 1997, also will include related online, print andoutreach components to get kids ready for school.  Shows, producedby partnerships of Children's TV Workshop (CTW)-Columbia TriStar TVDistribution and WGBH-TV Boston-Sirius Thinking, will join PBS-TheReady to Learn Service (RTL) program lineup.     Grants mark first time CPB has funded parent-orientedprogramming under RTL and first time RTL has targeted parents withspecific shows.  Until now, RTL has included children's mainstaysSesame St., Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, Barney & Friends, etc.  CPBPres. Richard Carlson called funding "a new vision for television,"adding that it makes sense to give parents how-to TV when oneconsiders that each child spends average of more than 4,000 hoursin front of TV by time he or she starts kindergarten.  CarolynnReid-Wallace, CPB senior vp-education & programming, predicted thatnew shows would become "signature shows and service" for RTL.     CTW/CTTD partnership will use its $4.2-million grant tojointly develop 40 episodes of Dragon Tales, animated musical showdesigned for preschoolers, and 13 episodes of Show and Tell Me,live-action series that teaches parents and caregivers how toparticipate in their children's learning process.  CPB said DragonTales takes place in "magical world of dragons," with charactersMax and his big sister Margarita, whose parents came to U.S. fromLatin America.  Children travel through storybook to Dragon Landand journey with their friend Blaze and other "lovable dragons." CPB said Blaze will ask viewers to sing, whistle, make sillysounds, laugh, cry, imitate musical instruments, do animal sounds. Show & Tell Me, which will have goal of reinforcing lessons inDragon Tales and other RTL shows, will feature celebrity guests,hidden camera segments, people-on-the-street interviews.  CTW andCTTD also will develop multimedia material to accompany series,including on-air and radio interstitial programming, magazines,internet applications.     WGBH-TV/Sirius partnership also received $4.2 million fordevelopment and production of 40 episodes of daily, half-hourliteracy series Between the Lions for 4-7-year-olds, and related13-part weekly half-hour series, Kids & How to Grow Them, forparents and caregivers.  Interactive Internet component also willbe developed.  CPB said Between the Lions is "first new show indecades" to promote literacy and teach skills beginning readersneed to master.  Series covers reading, writing, listening andspeaking skills.  Main characters are lions Zazzu and Zig who guardlibrary doors and teach children about reading.  CPB said onceinside library, viewers are transported to "another dimension"where books come to life.     Funding for programs is based in part on recently-awarded$7-million grant from Education Dept.'s National Early ChildhoodInstitute.  There currently are 44 stations participating in RTL,which includes up to 9 hours per day of children's programmingdaily.  Broadcast service is complemented by educational materials,workshops, activity guides, books that reinforce programming'smessages.Back to Headline List CopyrightPUBLIC BROADCASTING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996QED COMMUNICATIONS HIRES FIRM TO LOBBY ON PTV STATION SALESLEGISLATION     QED Communications, parent of WQED Pittsburgh, has hired Dutko& Assoc., Washington lobby firm, to lobby on legislation affectingsale of public broadcasting station, QED Communications Pres.George Miles confirmed.  He said public broadcaster hopes toconvince members of Congress and others that public licensees, WQEDsister station WQEX especially, should have option of usingsecondary frequencies for commercial purposes.     WQED doesn't have any specific new plans for secondaryPittsburgh market station WQEX, and Miles said using it forcommercial purposes is just one avenue QED Communications isexploring to raise money to escape $12-million debt.  Miles said hewas hired over year ago (PBR July 29/94 p3) to help station findsolutions to its financial difficulties.  He said QEDCommunications is looking at possibility of selling its magazineand/or other intellectual properties to work down debt.     WQED is working alone "for the most part" to advancelegislation that would give public broadcasters more flexibilitywith extra licenses, Miles said.  Other licensees, however,including group of northern Va. stations headed by Gen. Mgr. RogerMcIntosh, have been working Capitol Hill looking to loosenrestrictions on uses of 2nd market stations.  Miles said lobbyeffort is targeting "everyone... I'll even talk to you."  Rep.Fields (R-Tex.), House Telecom Subcommittee chmn., and Sen.Pressler (R-S.D.), Senate Commerce Committee chmn., are expected todraft CPB authorization legislation later this month that couldchange way public broadcasters operate.     While national organizations APTS, PBS, NPR and PRI havelobbied for bill that would clear way for establishment of trustfund designed to use leases and sales of excess system advanced TV(ATV) capacity for financing, some stations have expresseddiscomfort with idea of sacrificing their extra licenses for goodof system.  Some, like WQED, have said they believe they should befree to use these licenses as they see fit to ensure their ownfinancial stability.  APTS, however, has said that its plan is onlyone that would ensure PTV's continued universal availability andthat most stations, although uncertain at outset, have agreed tosupport their plan.  Under national organizations' plan, only onestation in each market would make transition to ATV, and otherstations' frequencies would be leased or sold (yet to bedetermined) to capitalize trust fund, which also would fund publicradio.     Stations lobbying on own for legislation that would allow morecommercial enterprises, including advertising and sales/leases ofsecondary stations, got boost recently when House TelecomSubcommittee Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.) told public broadcastingrepresentatives that he was considering "several ideas," and notjust one, to ensure continued funding for public broadcasting (PBRDec 29 p1).  He said he was doubtful public broadcasters would beable to capitalize $4-billion trust fund through ATV leases/salesalone.  Fields said if up to him, public broadcasters would have tofollow same rules as commercial counterparts, meaning they wouldhave to return NTSC spectrum soon after receiving ATV frequenciesand might have to participate in ATV spectrum auctions.  Fields'staffers in recent months have indicated he is more open tolegislation that would allow stations to experiment withrevenue-raising ventures, including more commercial enterprises, aslong as funds raised are used to further public broadcastingmission.Back to Headline List CopyrightPUBLIC BROADCASTING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations onbudget and telecom bills said recently that staff-levelnegotiations had rejected White House proposal for broadcasters'early return of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum. Sources said no deal had been reached on spectrum issues ashigh-level talks continued at White House.  They also said thatthere would be "no giveaways" to broadcasters as part of finalbudget deal.  Statement supported assertion by Senate MajorityLeader Dole (R-Kan.), who was reported by Reuters as objecting towhat he called "giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Rep. Fields(R-Tex.), House Telecom Subcommittee chmn., said recently that ifcommercial broadcasters must bid in auctions for advanced TV (ATV)spectrum, then so should public broadcasters.  He also said publicbroadcasters wouldn't get any breaks -- if commercial TV stationshave to trade analog spectrum for digital, so should they.  Publicbroadcasters have based their trust fund plan on having both analogand digital spectrum for some time and on having flexibility onwhen to switch to digital.  Most public broadcasters would havedifficulty funding equipment needed for ATV transition, and all butlargest producing stations probably would have trouble findingmoney to take part in spectrum auctions.  Meanwhile, sources saidsome published estimates of value of analog spectrum to be givenback after conversion of broadcasting services to digital have beenwildly exaggerated.  While some reports have put value of spectrumas high as $70 billion, sources said figure is more in neighborhoodof $6 billion.  That amount, they said, wouldn't reflect costs tosociety of having industry and consumers convert to newtechnologies before either is ready.  Negotiators also rejectedWhite House proposal for $1-billion subsidy to consumers to helpthem adjust to conversion through purchase of set-top boxes. Forcing consumers and industry in short term to use technology thatmarket hasn't found to be ready could short-circuit development ofATV, Hill sources said, adding that FCC has wide discretion todetermine whether ATV licenses should be awarded and whatconditions should be attached, including disposition of analogspectrum.Back to Headline List CopyrightPUBLIC BROADCASTING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996     Contributions from state govts. and state universities and     Contributions from state govts. and state universities andcolleges accounted for 23.8% of public broadcasting's FY 1994income, CPB report said, up from 22.4% year earlier.

Azteca currentlyproduces 70% of its own material.While Televisa commands 80% of Mexican audiences, Azteca's first majorchallenge will be to attack Televisa's advertising dominance. Longattacked for monopolistic practices, Televisa has for years attractedmajor advertisers with its Plan Amigo. A variation on thefour-for-the-price-of-one French Plan, which necessitates buying a year'sworth of ads the pervious fall, Plan Amigo offers bonuses in exchange forad exclusivity. Televisa is under investigation by Mexico's FederalCommission for Competition. Televisa reportedly stopped the Plan Amigolast fall, but its agreements with major advertisers are guarded secrets.Company boss Ricardo Salinas maintains that advertisers with TV Azteca arereaching more people for their money. Comparing the revamped network's topsoap Marielena with Televisa's concurrent nightly newscast, 24 Horas, anindependent source showed a cost per rating point of $590 versus $1200under Televisa's discount scheme. Launched a month ago, Marielena hasachieved a rating of 10.3% in Mexico City, compared with 16.2% for 24Horas. Top Azteca shows thus offer 40 to 62% savings to advertisers.Last November, Televisa subsequently pushed back the popular news show byhalf an hour to 22:30. Tacitly admitting Marielena's success, Televisareasoned that at 22:00, viewers of the flagship Channel 2 would be lesslikely to change to a Telemundo-produced soap if the popular half-hoursoap, Corazon Salvaje (formerly at 21:30) was still to come on Channel 2.Azteca's other late evening soap, El Penon del Amaranto is not faring aswell. Early ratings after Azteca's October re-launch showed only 3.3% ofMexico City homes watching P less than half the audience of Marielena(8.1) and less than 10% of the rating of rival Televisa's 21:00 Valentina(36.5). One of Azteca's top draws last year was La Cosa which airs Sunday(22:00), attracting 13.8% of Mexico City homes, based on November figures,compared with only 7.3% for Televisa's music show Noche de Valores onChannel 2. And it's not just a battle among the terrestrial networks.Conceding a lack of mass-appeal local product, an army of library-drivenchannels rely on both premium and free-to-air American fare to lureviewing in the 12.8% of homes with cable.Against popular local shows on the terrestrial networks, the new satelliteservice, Fox Latin America, is slotting its prime feature film fare aswell as drama series L.A. Law at 22:00. The satellite channel's top titlesin December included Home Alone, Come See the Paradise and Working Trash.The new cable programmers concede that the Latin countries are very much"developing" ones, and that subscription fees that will initially comprisethe bulk of revenues will be low. Fox, Tele-Uno and a slew of otherbudding cable channels will increasingly compete for ad revenues tosupport their admittedly risky ventures. Yet the pan-Latin Americanadvertising market remains relatively untested."Four years ago there were virtually no dedicated Mexican cable services;today you can count 35 Spanish language channels available to cablefranchises...it's very competitive," says Ernesto Vargas, vice presidentof MSO Multichannel and a partner in pan-Latin channels Tele-Uno and CineCanal. Vargas hopes to introduce a new, dedicated Mexican programmingchannel by 1995. Tele-Uno, the 24-hour U.S. series channel which draws onthe big Worldvision catalog, is distributed via satellite throughout LatinAmerica, along with other entertainment newcomers, TNT Latin America, CineCanal, Gems TV, HBO Ole, and Cine Latino, which this month extends itsnative Spanish service to the rest of Central America."Mexican product is clearly the most popular, the dominance of[Televisa-owned] Channel 2 is proof of this," says Vargas. "Nevertheless,Tele-Uno provides a good option. American comedy doesn't travel that well:it's action and suspense that plays best after local shows," he says.Vargas says Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place and The Heights are thechannel's most successful shows. According to Worldvision VP Bert Cohen,such shows create an audience awareness which may cross over to itsback-catalog classic series.Counterprogramming is key for the niche channels. "Multivision looks atwhat we have in our catalog and tells us how to use it effectively," saysCohen. rBack to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994Asian TV markets should continue to boom this year with China, Taiwan andAsian TV markets should continue to boom this year with China, Taiwan andSouth Korea ahead, according to Zenith Media's latest forecast.

Don't forget, it took the UK's Channel 4 ten years toget it right." Other innovations include an increase in news output with a30-minute bulletin at 20:00 and sports news at 22:00.RTL-5 has not yet reached its 10% share target. Thanks to an exceptionalfootball match on October 13 (which got a 31.8 rating), the channel'sshare peaked during its second week at 11.8% and decrease to andstabilized at just under 6% since (see chart).Overall RTL-5's programming strategy looks like a half-success: thoughRTL-5 has cannibalized its sister station RTL-4, the two CLT services nowtake a higher combined share than the latter did alone previously. Apartfrom RTL-4, the three public state channels of NOS and the cable stationshave seen a marginal erosion of their shares by RTL-5.Back to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994The mother of all quotas?The French parliament has decided that the education channel to launch bythe end of 1994 should carry 100% French material.

The fact that TNT-Cartoon is free-to-air rather than part of theSky pay package, has clearly helped its cause.Back to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994Peak European Viewing TimesFrance      19.00-22.00     12.30-13.30Germany     18.00-22.00Italy       13.00-14.30     19.30-22.30Spain       14.30-16.30     20.30-23.30UK          17.30-22.00Source: RAP researchBack to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994In Spain, Tele 5's mix of game shows, action films and variety programsIn Spain, Tele 5's mix of game shows, action films and variety programshas been derided as "tele-basura" or television garbage byJthe critics,but Tele 5's lowest common denominator approach has nonetheless producedhealthy ratings.

For each of five markets, the index refers to grossTV revenue in the latest month available compared to a year earlier. TheRAP composite index estimates European TV ad revenue during the lasttwelve months compared to 1992. Together, the five countries representover 75% of the total European market. Spain is excluded because highdiscount levels make monthly expenditure estimates unreliable.Italy airs well over 2,000 hours of animated programming a year, but localproducers are only responsible for a fraction of the output. Children'sprogramming, and animation in particular, has increased steadily over thelast five years, though the domestic production sector does not look toshare in the spoils.Speaking at a recent conference of Italian animation producers, AlfioBastiancich, secretary of the Associazione Italiana Film di Animazione saidItalian producers account for only 3% of animated broadcasts on the public andcommercial channels.Back to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994Still blessed with "favored growing market" status among programStill blessed with "favored growing market" status among programprospectors, the Asia-Pacific region promises double digit growth in TVadvertising in 1994.Aggregate TV ad spend across the 14-country region only accounted for .85%of GDP in 1992 (.23% in China), but 1993 witnessed a 10.6% increase inoverall advertising. With per capita GDPs on the rise, and an increasingnumber of channel choices, the region is hungry for product asopportunities for barter syndication grow. Politics permitting, China maybe on the fastest growth of all, with 9% GDP growth forecast for 1994 and1993 TV ad expenditure of $662 million, expanding by 45% in 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994New laws for Spanish adsThe Spanish government's adoption of the EU "Television Without Frontiers"legislation has sent Spain's television stations scrambling to discussfuture ad rates now that advertising will be reduced.After the Spanish government agreed to mandate a minimum of 20 minutesbetween commercial breaks, senior Spanish TV officials held a preliminarymeeting to establish new rates with less discounting. Even though rateswill likely go up, many ad agencies are pleased as currently commercialsget lost in frequent, lengthy breaks.Back to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994Holland's daytime debutDutch public television this month begins broadcasting a daily Dutch soap.Top Dutch independent producer, JE Entertainment, will produce On The RoadTo Tomorrow -- based on U.S. soap Ryan's Hope -- for the ailing publicnetwork Nederland 2.The soap will mark an unprecedented collaboration between Veronica, TROSand EO, the three broadcasters sharing airtime on Nederland 2.

The soap is one of RTL-4's most successfulshows with ratings of up to 18%.Back to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994EU directive:  A blessing in disguise?While French producers enjoyed their moment in the world political andeconomic spotlight last month, it turns out part of their fortress wasmore a Trojan Horse.The main target of U.S. negotiators at the GATT talks on the TV front wasthe EU's 1989 "Television Without Frontiers" directive which requires thatEuropean originated programming comprise the majority of broadcasters'schedules. But in fact the finer print of the directive may harbor asilver lining for U.S. distributors and new channels.To back its ban of TNT-Cartoon Network on cable last September, the Frenchgovernment claimed it was only acting to uphold the directive. But,according to an undisclosed legal opinion last summer by the EuropeanCommission, it seems Brussels takes a radically different view of theunderlying issue. The paper, obtained by French broadcast researcherJean-Pierre Jezequel, is the text of the EC ruling banning TF1 fromcreating a split of its service aimed at Belgian audiences. In an articleto appear in the monthly Angle Droit, Jezequel points out that the rulingsupports all the claims of Turner against the French government.Specifically, the Commission's interpretation of European law says:The directive forbids "all controls on broadcast services coming fromanother member-state, a fortiori any kind of licensing requirements;"however, the French have been insisting that each channel seekingdistribution in France get a CSA 'convention.'If a broadcast service respects the regulation of its country of origin,it need not be re-licensed elsewhere.Furthermore, to clarify the directive, the Commission cites article 59 ofthe Treaty of Rome (about the free flow of services through the EU), whichgrants no special 'cultural' status to television.If Turner decided to sue the French government and the CSA, it would haveits view supported by Brussels, concludes Mr. Jezequel. The only legalavenue left for the French to stop Turner would be to sue the UK in theEuropean Court to force it to apply the directive. But here the law mustgive way to politics. Thus the directive, widely criticized by U.S. rightsowners, could be a strong help to U.S. channels trying to penetrate theEuropean market. The 50% quota is restricted by the mention "whenpracticable" and does not even apply to a whole range of programming suchas news, music and sports. Provided they find a host state, one couldargue that the new channels have a legal protection against other foreigngovernments in Europe stronger than anywhere else in the world. rBack to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994Have shows, will travelCheap and cheerful game show formats continue to draw high marks acrossmultiple markets. Having conquered the margins of European TV schedules,U.S. formats adapt to new territories.Quota-resilient and economically sound, the ever-ready game show isenjoying a renaissance on the world's airwaves. But beyond the fanfare,glitz and prize money lurks a solid market vehicle: game shows are cheapto produce, draw solid early evening viewing shares and can be readilyadapted to almost any culture.Abiding by the programmers axiom that 'local plays best,' game showformats have carved an enviable place in international TV trade. Game showvendors are confident that their shows are the only geographicallytransparent TV formats. TV bargain hunters learned early-on the value ofunlimited supply, long runs and audience loyalty. Game shows also offer anideal platform for sponsorship and barter.Most frequently "co-produced" or rather "adapted," game shows are uniqueamong U.S. derived product in that they are rarely exported in theiroriginal form. Beyond their ability to secure the daytime or traditionalhousewife viewer, game shows' true value lies in its local adaptability.For young, cash-strapped networks, game shows are a stalwart of theschedule, both mornings, late afternoons and sometimes even prime time. Asmuch as 10% of some schedules are devoted to some form of audienceparticipation quiz shows and glamor games.In the U.S., familiar game shows have been around for two generations andremain popular. The new syndicated 30-minute version of The Price isRight, a show originally launched three decades ago, proving that theformat is is one of TV's enduring classics. When those shows wereintroduced to European audiences in the wake of 1980s TV deregulation,pundits said such crass commercial exports could never repeat their homegrown successes and that their novel popularity would fade.But they proved wrong. As in the U.S., game shows have establishedthemselves as Europe's most constant genre. In Spain, Italy, France andGermany the Wheel of Fortune, Price is Right and Pyramid are now solidrating busters for the dominant channels, scheduled mostly in late morningor early evening slots.But not just any game will play. The formula may seem simple to produce,but getting the chemistry right is not easy, which is largely why U.S.formats dominate long running games (5-7 episodes per week). FremantleInternational has foreign production subsidiaries in the UK, Spain,Canada, Portugal, Greece, Australia, and Turkey and controls over 50% ofglobal game show distribution.Owned 80% by The Interpublic group, Fremantle also is well-positioned toexploit cash plus barter arrangements with international product groupsand clients such as Unilever. Thanks to barter, Fremantle has launched nofewer than nine shows in fast-deregulating Turkey during the last twoyears. Similar approaches are on tap for central and eastern Europeanmarkets."Nobody can re-invent the wheel," says Fremantle president and CEO PaulTalbot who maintains that the basic types of games were invented in the1950s in the United States. This view is shared by Michael and Roger Kingof syndicator King World, which distributes only two game shows, Jeopardyand The Wheel of Fortune, and admitted recently that they have looked invain for similarly strong product. King World has sold its two shows inall major markets, often with Fremantle as a producer, since Talbot hassecured production rights for both shows across western Europe. FremantleInternational has 64 game shows running in 17 countries.Europe's commercial networks tend to stick with proven formats, butproducers are anxious to develop their own shows. According to a programdatabase compiled by French consultancy INA, most shows are adaptations.But European networks do experiment with new game concepts often based onboard games, but few survive more than a season, and almost none managesto sell across borders. One of the few examples of a successful longrunning home grown show is Des Chiffres et des Lettres, a word andmathematics game broadcast on France 2 since the 1970s, and nowreformatted with some success by Channel 4 in the UK, VTM in Belgium andLa2 in Spain. According to France 2, the show has even recently arousedsome interest from U.S. buyers. Game shows could easily find themselves atthe forefront of new interactive TV capabilities. With Twentieth CenturyFox's upcoming multi-million dollar adventure game format Scavengers, thegame show will meet "techno-reality" drama. With a set in London,Scavengers' European co-production partners will shoot their own versionsout of the same production facility. European producers have more successwith 'near game show' formats. These "entertainment" shows usually run ona weekly basis, and are a mix of music, dance or even sports contests.Such quasi-game shows are the way of the future and are a distinctlyEuropean modification of the genre. One of the few successful purveyors ofEuropean produced game show formats, French producer Jacques Antoine hascreated 'adventure game shows,' expensive 90-minute monthly programs whichoften feature sports contests in exotic places. Among his most recentproducts, Fort Boyard has penetrated Scandinavia, where the show ismodified to local tastes although it is actually shot in France. ButAntoine has yet to come up with a five-days-a-week competitor to the U.S.shows.The economics of game shows are simple. The price broadcasters pay for ashow in the major markets depends largely on its potential audience; thus,a show for an access slot is more expensive than one for daytime. InFrance, industry sources reveal that TF1 used to pay up to $26,000 perepisode for its access shows (which it moved in 1992 to daytime) and paysnow up to $22,000. Shows on rival France 2 aired at lunch time areestimated at up to $20,000.Broadcasters' revenue for the same shows can vary considerably. Wheel ofFortune, on TF1 at 11:50 a.m., carries a single break from which itgrosses about $60,000, on top of the show's two sponsorship contributions(estimated at $20,000). The Price is Right can gross over $200,000 perday. In Germany, according to data supplied by the advertising agencySaatchi & Saatchi, in 1992 the Wheel of Fortune on average grossed$600,000 per episode, in part due to its 19:20 time slot.Game shows offer considerable financing and scheduling flexibility. InSpain, where TV ad regulations are lax, there are few curbs on productplacement or sponsorship. Contestants' desks can be huge soap boxes withthe brand name displayed continuously, something unthinkable elsewhere inEurope. Program duration can also be changed. Due to popularity withadvertisers, The Price is Right on Canale 5 in Italy, which started as ahalf-hour program, was extended to one hour and even to two hours, beforesettling back to one hour.France Television has been running 90-minute prime time specials of itstwo Grundy shows, Everybody's Equal and Going For Gold, which regularlytop the ratings of their respective channels, France 2 and 3. The latestspecial on France 3 lifted the channel's share to 24%, above its averageof 15%. Fremantle typically acts as domestic producer of its showsoperating through a local production subsidiary. Last year the companyopened a game "factory" near Cologne in Germany and has subsidiaries inseven other countries outside the U.S. Where there is no local corporateaffiliate, Fremantle acts as co-producer with a broadcaster or localproduction company and takes up 40-70% of the profits, according tooutside estimates.Most recently, Fremantle has extended its Latin American operations,concluding a co-production deal with Brazil's TV Bandeirantes forSupermarket Sweep and $25,000 Pyramid. Fremantle also inked deals forlocal versions of Let's Make a Deal and Swap Meet, with Ecuador'sEcuavisa. The only places where shows are sold in their original formatare very small markets. Grundy, the only would-be global rival toFremantle, is the producer of all its shows, though sometimes with a localpartner.Paul Guilbert, who oversees foreign licensees' production of King Worlddistributed shows, insists on close control over such local versions.Typically, major deviations from the guidelines only occur afterconsiderable argument with the original producers/distributors.Despite the dominance of Fremantle and King World formats circulating in mostmajor markets, there remains considerable room for growth. The emergingsyndication market and new cable services are hungry for product.Game shows are not suitable for every channel. "Second tier"entertainment-led stations such as M6 in France and Pro 7 in Germany andRTL 5 in Holland have avoided game shows, counterprogramming lateafternoon time slots to garner the valuable young adult or urbandemographic, often with U.S. series and sit-coms. But other relativelysmall stations do carry game shows, like Sky One in the UK. In France,TMC, a national cable and satellite service, has just introduced anoriginal format, Vitamime, produced by Canal+'s Ellipse.Some mainline European networks are reluctant to overload their scheduleswith "down market" stripped game shows. ITV scheduling executive DavidBrenan, points out that, apart from the channel's traditional weekday gameshow at 9.30 a.m., his quiz shows tend to appear once a week and to getrenewed regularly. "We look for new ideas all the time," says Brenan,"usually, foreign formats would be proposed to the network throughindependent UK producers."rBack to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994Producers & distributorsFremantle InternationalOne Dag Hammarskjold plazaNew YorkNY 10017 USATel: +1 212 421 4530Fax: +1 212 207 8357CEO: Paul TalbotKing World International1700 BroadwayNew YorkNY 10019-5963USATel: +1 212 315 4000Fax: +1 212 247 7674President: Fred CohenGrundy WorldwideBargehouse Crescent 34, Upper groundLondon SE1 9PDUnited KingdomTel:+44 71 928 8942Fax:+44 71 928 8417Senior vice-president light entertainment: Alam BoydEllipse Programs15 square de Vergennes75015 ParisFranceTel:+33 1 45 31 00 01Fax:+33 1 48 56 80 34Director, quiz and magazines: Jean-Jacques PasquierAction TimeWrendal House2 Whitworth Street WestManchester M1 5WXUnited KingdomTel:+44 61 236 8999Fax:+44 61 236 8845Chief executive: Stephen LeahyConsultancyINA4, avenue de l'Europe94366 Bry-sur-MarneFranceTel:+33 1 49 83 20 00Fax:+33 1 49 83 25 82Head of research: Regine ChaniacBack to Headline List CopyrightRAP: RATINGS ADVERTISING PROGRAMMING via NewsNetJANUARY 1994New game show formatsOriginal game show formats recently introduced in Europe:Lose a millionProducer: Action TimeBroadcaster: ITV, UKThe winner is the contestant who manages to lose the most amount ofmoney.SabotageProducer:Action TimeBroadcaster: Channel 4, UKAn all-women knowledge contest where it is more important to sabotage theother contestants chances than to make your own mark.La Cena e servitaBroadcaster: Rete4, ItalyProducer: FininvestParticipants go through various sports and knowledge contests and a winallows you to chose one plate; the first to get a full set menu wins.TraumhochzeitBroadcaster: RTL, GermanyProducer: John de MolThree couples, dressed for a wedding, are introduced through acandid-camera type of sequence where one makes a marriage proposal to theother.

By law, a "self-governing statutory corporation,"Channel 4 programs an eclectic variety of both high-brow documentaries andinnovative drama, which are largely financed by the ratings success ofunabashedly commercial U.S. imports.The channel has carved a niche for itself in the UK, and is confident thatits programming mix will be resilient in a fast-expanding, competitivemultichannel marketplace.Albeit a mandated "minority broadcaster" -- it must devote its airtime toalternative programming, a range of artistic, political or otherwise"challenging" formats and genres -- Channel 4's annual revenues are 100%commercial. With annual ad revenue of #306 million ($456 million, 1993estimates) Britain's fourth terrestrial service is a strong magnet for theupmarket viewer who would otherwise be tuned to ad-free BBC2.Far from letting its quasi-governmental status keep its programmingstrategy rooted in didactic fare, Channel 4, a primary patron of theindependent production sector, has taken the offensive, and come away withsizable gains in numerous time periods.On January 1 Channel 4 celebrated its first year unleashed from its fosterparents, the ITV network. The ten year old channel now sells its own adtime and buys its own programming separate from the ITV network center:the result is a clear ratings and advertising success."Basically, the audience we get with American programs allows us todevelop innovative, non-mainstream shows," says Caroline Thomson, head ofcorporate affairs at Channel 4.The channel actually airs the largest percentage of U.S. material on UKterrestrial TV. Much of it is cult, such as off-beat theatrical films, aswell as the higher end of available U.S. drama and comedy, including NYPDBlue, which makes its winter schedule debut and is intended to bolsterChannel 4's admittedly weak Saturday evening.Last fall, Channel 4 scored its highest marks with the domestic soap"Brookside," delivering a total of 6.16 million viewers (w/e Nov 28) forits highest rated episode (each of the three episodes is screened twice aweek).Overall, Channel 4 ran 2,037 hours of acquired programs in 1992, 48% ofwhich were first run. Although non-feature U.S. shows accounted for only41% of total airtime devoted to acquisitions, their cost represented 52%of the #14.5 million spent. On top of this figure, #8.9 million was spenton acquired feature films (the channel also produces about ten films ofits own every year).Although acquisitions represented 45% of the 1992 schedule, they accountedfor only 12% of the total programming expenses of #200 million. Resistingpressure to go downmarket for the maximum share, Channel 4 remainsfaithful to its remit. There is a safety net, however: a sophisticatedarrangement set up by the 1990 Broadcasting Act requires cross-subsidieswith ITV if Channel 4's share of ad revenue falls or rises too much.Provided the channel maintains an audience share at or over 9%, itscurrent program orientation won't likely be questioned. Thanks to the risein the station's market share and an overall acceleration in UK TVadvertising expenditure growth (see page 1), Channel 4 saw a handsomewindfall in revenues which grew by an estimated 22% in 1993 to #306million. After a drop to #184 million in 1993, the program budget shouldbe back to its 1992 level of #200 million in 1994.According to Thomson, this should allow a little breathing space forproduction budgets, which had been squeezed by the recession. U.S. showsshould remain relatively inexpensive, as competition with the BBC and ITVis marginal. "A U.S. series cannot keep its slot on ITV with six millionviewers, while it's a hit on Channel 4 with four million," Thomson says.The growth of satellite service Sky One has somewhat inflated prices, butthe two channels rarely go head-to-head in programming. Sky mainstays suchas Star Trek and Beverly Hills 90210 would not be suitable for Channel 4according to Thomson.Perhaps Channel 4's greatest coup has been the huge success of itsrenegade, youth-oriented morning show, The Big Breakfast. Introduced inOctober 1992, the show has drawn large chunks of audience away fromstruggling GMTV, the new ITV morning licensee. In September 1992, Channel4's 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. audience share was 4%, in November 1993 it had jumpedto 30% while ITV's had slipped from 53% to 43%. In the younger age groupsthe show has even a bigger lead. Alone, The Big Breakfast is responsiblefor 20% of the channel's ad sales. The fast-paced, irreverent show isindicative of Channel 4's role as innovator in the UK marketplace.Back to Headline List WT03-B10-41IA087-000629-B026-238http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/pb58.html 205.156.212.5 19970122042157 text/html 56257HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:19:40 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:20 GMTContent-length: 56070Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/pb58.html Sample Issue Copyright REPORT ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE via NewsNet March 21, 1995 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES ONLINE GAMBLING HITS THE WEB Is Internet Casinos' Cyberspace Venture A Crapshoot for Internet Commerce?

Internet Casinos Inc. soon will be stretchingthe bounds of the Internet, and in the process raisingserious questions about how federal and state gamblingand tax laws apply to cyberspace.      From a casino based in the Dutch Caribbeanisland of St. Martin, the company plans to launch anonline gambling hall, styled after traditionalcasinos, on the Web in mid-May.  The site will offerkeno, blackjack, roulette, backgammon, animated horseracing, more than 30 different slot machines and avariety of other games of chance.      The regulatory quandary is that the onlinecommunity will play with - and win - real money.Internet Casinos will require players to send aminimum of $50 to the offshore casino, and the onlinegambler then will receive an account and password forgambling.  Winnings then can be wired back to theplayer within 48 hours, or can be deposited back intothe offshore account to earn interest and serve asholdings for future gaming.      While it may sound like a dubious propositionthat few would attempt blind, about 1,500 online usershave preregistered for the site since it first went upa week ago, said Internet Casinos President WarrenEugene.      "We feel that the 'net community is capable oflooking after themselves," Eugene said.  "This is aFirst Amendment issue."      The casino's virtual doors will open May 15, butno money will be accepted until one week before thelaunch, Eugene said.  The company already has $1.2million to bankroll the Web casino, with a $1 millionline of credit available, he said.  To keep the casinofluid until it builds a solid cash reserve, bets arekept to a $500 maximum, although the minimum goes aslow as 5 cents for the slot machines.      Payment can be made by Visa, MasterCard andcashier's check, Eugene said, adding that the companyis in discussions with both DigiCash BV and CyberCashInc. about adding their online payment capabilities.New Dimension Because of Location      While issues of local control in cyberspace havebeen raised before, most notably when states try toprosecute the placement of pornography online, theInternet Casinos venture raises questions of law andtax liability because of its location outside thiscountry.      Online gambling networks such as the systemsbeing marketed by subsidiaries of Interactive NetworkInc. and NTN Communications Inc. are restricted bylaws in different states that govern what types ofbetting can be conducted from the home or designatedlocations.  Because Internet Casinos is locatedoutside the United States, at-home wagering laws andage restrictions technically may not apply to the Website.  "We're being very cautious about not violatinginternational laws," Eugene said.      The odds of this system going online withoutchallenges are slim, since there is no way for thecompany to monitor the age of potential gamblers andmany state governments have retained tightrestrictions on gambling.  But there may not be muchthat the federal or state governments can do toprevent the online gambling.FBI to Make Statement on Online Gambling      The Federal Bureau of Investigation soon willmake an announcement relating to online gamblingissues, and would not comment for this article untilafter the announcement is made.      Aside from state concerns over gambling, thefederal government also has a stake in this type ofoffshore venture.  Gambling revenues are taxableincome, but if cyber-winnings from Internet Casinoscan be kept in the foreign bank, the government mayhave a difficult time taxing these funds.      Eugene insists the venture is legitimate, and heis publishing the algorithms and codes used for thegames for users to verify the slots are not "rigged."Interactive Casinos will spot-check the system toensure it is not tampered with, he said.      Internet Casinos can be reached at (416)444-8835.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE via NewsNetMarch 21, 1995OPEN MARKET TO RELEASE COMPETITOR TO NETSCAPEWill Use Multiple Security Schemes      Open Market Inc. made multiple moves tore-establish itself in the quickly crowding market forInternet commerce solutions, announcing a host of newsoftware products and services and a relationship withFirst Union Corp. to bring its customers onto theInternet.      Among the new products is a secure World WideWeb server aimed at supplanting NetscapeCommunications Corp.'s early lead in providing thebasis tools to companies that want to sell on the Web.Moving Into Service-Oriented Business      The broad suite of products launches Open Marketout of its first phase, which consisted of hostinginformation vendors in an online marketplace, into anew service- and tool-oriented business.  At thecenter of this business is the Open Market SecureWebServer product that distinguishes itself fromNetscape's Netsite Commerce Server and Spry Inc.'sforthcoming SafetyWeb by supporting the two leadingsecurity protocols - Netscape's Secure Socket Layer(SSL) and the secure hypertext transfer protocol(S-HTTP) supported by most other Web developers - inone package, giving it maximum possible exposure toWeb users.      Netscape has taken an early lead by establishingits Navigator Web browser as the largest in use.  Buteven with a current estimated 77 percent of thebrowser market, Netscape has no guarantee it willcontinue to dominate.  As quickly as it took the lead,it could be supplanted by a newer, niftier product.      The majority of other Web browser makers arelicensees of Spyglass Inc., (the master licensor forthe National Center for Supercomputing Applications[NCSA], which developed Mosaic) and Spyglass is firmlybehind S-HTTP.      Although Netsite will build S-HTTP into futureversions of its secure products (REC, March 7, p. 1)the time frame for integration is uncertain.  OpenMarket, by supporting both standards, suddenly lookslike the server of choice for companies that want todo business now with the whole Web and not wait to seewhat Netscape does.  Although Open Market will licenseSSL from Netscape, terms of the arrangement were notavailable.  Netscape has stated that it intends tooffer the technology to all comers for a one-timelicensing fee.      The release of tools is directed at largercompanies with  established brands who don't want anintermediary between themselves and theiraudience/customers.  One of the first adopters ofSecure WebServer is Time Inc., which is migrating itspopular Pathfinder Web site to Open Market's software.Time plans to begin charging for subscriptions to itsonline magazines and services in the next few months.      "These new products allow companies to dobusiness over the World Wide Web on their own terms,"said Shikhar Ghosh, chief executive of Open Market."They support electronic commerce in a way thattranscends mere transactions by supporting ongoingcustomer relationships and the creation of brandidentity."      Other adopters of Open Market's server includeLexis-Nexis and the Copyright Clearance Center.  Bothcompanies are using the software for Lexis-Nexis'Information Marketplace project to sell copyrightedmaterial over the Internet while ensuring that holdersof intellectual property receive full compensation fortheir work.Rebuilt Server Technology From Ground Up      Like Netscape, Open Market says it has rebuiltthe server technology from the ground up.  The companyclaims both faster performance and support for as manyas 1,000 simultaneous users.      "The Open Market WebServers are not derivativesof freeware server implementations," RobertWeinberger, Open Market's vice president of marketing,said.  "They have been architected from scratch toachieve the highest levels of performance,functionality and interoperability."      This is especially important as security gapsand faults are turning up in the HTTP implementationsavailable as freeware from NCSA and CERN, the EuropeanLaboratory for Particle Physics.  The ComputerEmergency Response Team, the quasi-public Internetsecurity patrol that tracks developing problems withthe network's integrity and keeps records of attackson sites, issued a warning in February that sectionsof the public domain server software are inherentlyinsecure and could allow malevolent  hackers access toa company's entire system through the Web serverholes.Secure Link to Transaction System      Unlike Netscape, however, Open Market also willmarket a full system to enable transactions, includinga back office connection to a transaction network toprocess credit card charges.  The separate module,called the Commerce Connection, establishes a securelink to Open Market's existing transaction system toprocess orders in real time.  Open Market also willprovide billing services if necessary.      In an agreement with First Union Corp., theserver software will be used to host an online mallfor as many of the bank's 35,000 merchant accounts aschoose to develop an online presence.  First Unionalso will try to encourage its account holders to usethe system to access their account information andwill move quickly to get every department in theRichmond, Va., bank to use the Internet to reach andservice customers.      The Secure WebServer will be demonstratedpublicly at the Internet World trade show in San Jose,Calif., April 10-13 and should be availablecommercially by the end of April.      It will sell for $4,995, but carry a mandatoryannual service charge of $1,995.  Commerce Connectionwill retail for $2,495 and also carry an annualservice charge of $1,995.  Open Market is selling anunsecure version of its WebServer for $1,495.Security can be added to that product using a $3,995Security Module.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE via NewsNetMarch 21, 1995CompuServe BUYS SPRY FOR $100MEveryone Has A Browser; What Next?By Nate ZelnickAssociate Editor      Now that CompuServe Inc. and Spry Inc. haveagreed to tie the knot - with the online servicepaying a hefty $100 million dowry for its new mate -links between the top consumer online services and theWorld Wide Web are nearing completion.  All thatremains is dealing with the hangover after thecheerful reception and, of course, paying all thebills.      One particularly knotty question is how theonline services will deal with secure access to Websites that plan to sell goods and services throughsecure connections with consumers.  CompuServeInformation Services' (CIS) customers will use Sprytechnology, which supports only the secure hypertexttransfer protocol (S-HTTP), while Prodigy Services Co.and Delphi Internet Services Inc. have licensedNetscape Communications Corp.'s technology and - inthe short term - will use Secure Socket Layer (SSL)only.      The number of users coming in from the consumeronline services likely will double the total number ofWeb-capable users in the United States alone.  Whileserver and browser makers are moving quickly to expandtheir secure transactions offering to all availablecustomers on all platforms, the consumer onlinecompanies have had to recast themselves to match thepace of technical innovation on the Internet.Adding 'Access' Like Jumping on Train      The primary problem is that Internetapplications such as the Web are not static featuresthat can be added to an existing system; adding"access" to it is like trying to board a moving train.Web software developers are struggling to upgrade thepresentation and application interfaces of servers andbrowsers.  Netscape's proprietary extensions, whichadd everything from the silly and annoying "blink"feature that flashes lines of text on a page to thelong-needed image adjustments that allow developers towrap text around a picture or present text in columns,are a contentious issue for other developers whoresent Netscape's moves to add to hypertext markuplanguage (HTML) without first consulting the standardsbodies.      In the face of this problem, CompuServe'sdecision to buy Spry - even at what seems an extremelyhigh premium - makes good business sense.  Compared toAmerica Online Inc.'s $35 million purchase ofBookLink, an untested company with only one product(which never was tested in the market), Spry's pricewas a bargain.      CompuServe and Spry are a match made in heaven.CompuServe is buying a fully operational company withlots of products in the marketplace and consistentblack ink on its balance sheets.  Privately held Sprygenerated $16 million in revenue last year and, basedon annualized projections of first-quarter earnings,was expected to make more than $40 million this year.      Even more important is the ever-elusive synergyso often cited in mergers and acquisitions.  In thiscase it may be real.  Spry and CompuServe both haveimpressive credentials in the corporate arena.  Notonly is CompuServe the business favorite because ofthe rich databases of CIS, but its Network Servicesdivision provides private dial-up facilities for VisaInternational Inc.'s network and other big businesses.      Spry's AIR series of transmission controlprotocols/Internet protocols (TCP/IP) connectivitytools and the recently released Internet Office suiteof internetwork applications are corporate favoritesfor building private and public Internet links.  Thecompany also launched an aggressive plan to market itsturnkey Internet access software packages, Internet ina Box and Mosaic in a Box, to corporations wishing touse the Web as a communications medium to reach theircustomer base.  General Electric Co.'s plasticsdivision was the first big company on board (REC, Dec.13, 1994, p. 9).      Spry President David Pool - who personally willpocket between $20 million and $30 million in thepurchase of the privately held company - told REC inDecember that Spry planned to develop deals with allcomers.      "We want to ship a disk with every refrigeratorso that  customers can just pop it into theircomputers and reach the manufacturer's Web site," hesaid.  Under the original plan, Spry would pay abounty for every customer a third-party companybrought onto the Internet using Spry software.  Poolsaid the company plans to continue this venture usingCompuServe's network as the primary carrier.      The use of the network will be the keycompetitive change in Spry's business.  In the initialrelease of Internet in a Box, Sprint Corp.'sSprintLink network was the primary carrier and chargedan exorbitant $8 per hour to connect to Spry's whollyowned access provider InterServ (although users couldconnect to any point-to-point protocol [PPP)provider).  Pricing for the network connections willbe announced April 11 at Internet World in San Jose,Calif.      Spry also brings to the table its other"affiliated companies," Free Range Media and NovX,both of which were brought back into the company lastmonth.  Free Range provides Web authoring services anddesign consultation for companies developingcommercial sites.  NovX develops and sellspre-configured server computers.      Spry has sold more than 200,000 copies ofInternet in a Box to consumers through book andcomputer stores.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE via NewsNetMarch 21, 1995CHANGE AT INTERACTIVE GIFTMAY SIGNAL STRONG PATENT STAND      Interactive Gift Express Inc. (IGE) named acorporate turnaround specialist its new chairman andpresident, a move that may be a precursor to thecompany taking a stronger stand on its patentaffecting electronic commerce applications.      Arnold Freilich takes the president's helm fromRobert Cosby, who came on board at IGE last Decemberaround the same time the company acquired what isknown as the "Freeny patent."      The patent covers "the transfer of digitalinformation to a material object at the point ofsale," and, if enforced, it theoretically covers theuse of debit cards in certain situations, salesthrough bulletin board services, and the digitaltransmission of software from a central site to remotelocations for recopying and sale.  This type of systemis being developed by IBM Corp. and Hughes NetworkSystems Inc. using DirecPC satellite technology.Resignation Only Part of the Shake-up      Cosby's resignation was just part of theshake-up in the company's upper echelons.  Companyfounder Clarence Jolley stepped down as chairman ofthe board but retains a spot as director, while histwo sons, Layne and Wayne, have resigned from theboard.  Michael Franzese, Arthur Casey Stern III andGrant Robertson also joined the board, bringing thenumber of directors to five.      Although Freilich characterized Cosby'sresignation as amicable, the new president admittedCosby was not geared toward IGE's interactive businessplan.  IGE's core business has been its wire-basedgift delivery service, but the company plans to movequickly into the multimedia market, Freilich told REC.Part of IGE's new business will be branching intokiosk-based touch-screen gift ordering, along withbringing their traditional paper-based catalog online.      IGE is looking at a variety of online serviceproviders, including America Online Inc., for portingthe gift catalog online, Freilich said.  The companyhas not ruled out venturing onto the Web or intoInternet malls, however.  With both the kiosk andonline ordering services still in the planning stages,IGE plans to take its first steps into the interactivemarket through licensing and litigation.      IGE has stated its intention to license theFreeny patent, and litigate against possibleinfringers.  The company recently brought in DavidFink, former senior vice president of patentexploitation firm Refac Inc., to head its licensingeffort.  IGE also completed a private placement ofconvertible notes to finance this campaign.      While the Freeny patent has the potential togenerate millions of dollars in fees, IGE needs thevoluntary licensing from at least one large company tolegitimize its claim.  Enforcing broad interactivepatents can be a costly proposition if IGE is forcedto take all infringers to court.  Also, in the newrealm of digital commerce and communications, broadlyworded multimedia patents are finding it difficult tostand up before the courts and the government, asevidenced by the rejection of Compton's New Media'spatent on multimedia navigation that was shot downlast year by a patent review board.      Although the company is keeping a tight rein onits patent, it will be very selective in terms ofwhich companies it will go after, Freilich said."We're not afraid to go to court, but we're not goingto say this patent covers the world," he said.      IGE reportedly was in discussions with IBM Corp.and Bank of America, but Freilich would not comment onany of the company's negotiations.  Aside from hisrole on the board, Franzese is a full-time consultantto Bank of America.  According to Freilich, IGE isvery close to licensing its technology to a"noteworthy" client, and expects to announce thisarrangement within three to six months.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE via NewsNetMarch 21, 1995FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SET TO COVER E-MAILIN COMPLEX NEW FRAUD REGULATIONSCumbersome Rules May Well Hamper Electronic CommerceBy Michael F. CavanaghContributing Editor      On Capitol Hill there is a strong wind blowingagainst onerous federal regulation, but down thestreet a few blocks at the Federal Trade Commission,sweeping new rules are evolving rapidly - rules thatwould rewrite a substantial part of direct marketinglaw and put cyberspace under a complex new regulatoryscheme.  (Unlike a proposed bill in Congress, whichmust move through the often arduous legislativeprocess, federal regulations need only be approved bythe agency proposing such rules after public comment,and thus there is a certainty of action.)      What the FTC is doing, in a nutshell, is takingmyriad issues relating to telemarketing abuse andsqueezing them into an opportunity to regulateelectronic mail, online services and cyberspace ingeneral.  These rules are targeted at businessdealings with "consumers," not mostbusiness-to-business transactions, but the nature ofthe requirements could make the distinction betweenconsumers and business employees almost meaningless.Acting in Response to Telemarketing Act      To be sure, the FTC is acting in response to theTelemarketing Act of 1994, signed into law last Augustto fight deceptive (and also highly annoying)practices employed by some telemarketers.  Congressdirected the FTC to establish a set of specificregulations to fight the estimated $40 billion peryear that is lost by consumers as a result oftelemarketing fraud.      The law defines telemarketing as any plan,program or campaign conducted to induce payment forgoods or services via the telephone.  The FTC statesin its Federal Register notice announcing the proposedrules, however, that it has made "one addition" that"clarifies" the definition.  The FTC adds "the use ofa facsimile machine, computer modem, or any othertelephonic medium" to the definition of telemarketing.Thus, e-mail suddenly is at the heart of a complex setof new rules and regulations.      Experts on the issue told REC last week that the"addition" is remarkable in that Congress had nointention of dealing with computer communications inthis legislation.      According to noted analyst John Awerdick, anattorney in Newark, N.J., who is representing severalmajor companies in this proceeding:  "It's clear thatthe Congress was aiming the legislation at plainvanilla telemarketing fraud."  The  problem, saidAwerdick, is that "while there shouldn't be deceptiveadvertising in any medium, the time and nature ofdisclosures to the consumer may need to differ" basedon what medium is used.      Washington attorney Allan Adler, who will befiling comments with the FTC on behalf of the DirectMarketing Association, said that "instead of focusingon the scam artists that led Congress to enact thelegislation, these [FTC] drafters regulate the entirebroad spectrum of telephone use, portraying  it asinherently risky."  The telephone has been around fora long time, Adler said, and "one can now only imaginehow the FTC plans to treat cyberspace [now that it isto be covered under their regulations.]"What Do Regulations Require?      What specifically do these regulations requirefrom anyone who makes over 10 "sales" of anythingannually via the telephone, fax and e-mail combined?(This is the new definition of "telemarketer.")  Thelong list includes strikingly different disclosuresand practices, depending on whether or not the saleinvolves office equipment, cleaning goods, acharitable  contribution, any prizes, equity in abusiness.  The list goes on and on.      As a fairly general matter, these proposedregulations require that "before payment is requestedfor goods and services offered" the seller must listall terms and material restrictions, cancellationpolicies, exchange and refund options, etc.  Detailedrecords now must be kept, listing all solicitationactivities for a 24-month period.Complete List is Long One      To detail the complete list of regulations withwhich telemarketers must comply would take virtuallythis entire issue of REC.  While many of theprovisions are quite benign and do seek to target realfraud patterns, virtually anyone involved inelectronic commerce will need to know what they are.More precisely, they probably will need to have alawyer close at hand when anything that could beconstrued as marketing takes place.      As previously noted, there is an importantexemption to these regulations, but one that isparticularly problematic for the electronic mailindustry.      These regulations exempt most (but not all)business-to-business solicitations.  Given that,what's the problem?  Think about it.  In anextraordinarily high number of situations in thee-mail world, it's impossible to determine whether ornot the e-mail address listed is a personal orbusiness mailbox, or indeed whether the person usesthat mailbox for personal as well as  business use.(Below you will find an e-mail address for thiswriter.  Is it a business or personal address?  Do youwant to risk prosecution by a state attorney generalin order to find out?)  Similarly, the use of many faxmachines blurs with respect to whether it is businessor personal.      In light of the vast array of new issues raisedby coverage of e-mail, is it possible that the FTC hasadded "modem" communications inadvertently to thisproposal?      Quite the contrary, as it turns out.  Severaltimes in the notice respondents (anyone who commentson a proposal) are asked to address whether or not thedefinitions are "sufficiently broad to encompasscurrent as well as future technology."  In  fact, itappears clear that the FTC views this telemarketingrulemaking as its entrance into cyberspace regulationand that the commission wants to be sure that itsdefinition covers everything imaginable.      In sum, the Federal Trade Commission is poisedto actively enter cyberspace and begin the regulationof all electronic commerce.  Most reasonable peoplewould say that consumers do deserve protection fromfraudulent operators,  regardless of what mechanismthey use to perpetrate their deceptions, includingelectronic mail.Frustration at Attempts to Overreach      On the other hand, it also might be appropriateto suggest that the backlash against government rulesand regulations demonstrated recently at the ballotbox probably manifested an American frustration withregulators' attempts to overreach logical bounds whenexpanding rules designed for one purpose into areasthat have not been examined adequately.      There still is time to have your organizationcomment on these proposed regulations.  The full textof the proposed regulations are found in the FederalRegister of Feb. 14, 1995, on pages 8313 through 8333.Formal comments must be submitted to the FTC by March31.  (Full instructions can be  found in the FederalRegister notice.)      ________________________________________      Michael F.

If this metering system becomes standard, whichis a goal of the partnership, information in privatedatabases may leave the privilege of the businessworld and become affordable to the home user for thefirst time.      Folio, along with Novell Corp., the CopyrightClearing Center (CCC) and several information meteringsystems makers announced March 6 an applicationprogramming interface (API), server software andsecure links to a transaction system that will providea reimbursement system for use of copyrighted materialsold on the Internet or other wide area networks suchas Novell and AT&T Corp.'s AT&T Netware Connect.  TheFolio metering API is the key component of a systemcalled the Information Marketplace proffered by thecompany and its partners, which also include WaveSystems Corp. and CD-Max Inc.      Folio, of Provo, Utah, recently was bought byReed-Elsevier PLC, which also owns the Lexis-Nexisdatabases for legal and news information.      The system is designed for publishers who wantto offer electronic access to their data, but areafraid that going digital means losing control oftheir materials.  Currently, these newsletter,newspaper and database publishers have had to usehigh-priced proprietary systems such as DialogInformation Services Inc. and Lexis-Nexis, which limittheir potential audience to institutional researchersand tie them to clunky interfaces on proprietarynetworks.      With internetworking growing faster than anyprevious communications medium in history, theopportunities for content providers are huge, as arethe risks.      Folio's InfoBase technology has been a popularway to distribute material on disk or CD-ROM.  TheInformation Marketplace moves that model into thewider world of internetworks such as the Internet,although it also can be used on proprietary orcommercial networks.      "The Folio API is a logical extension to ourexisting Rights Management technology which todayallows publishers to restrict usage of infobases onCD-ROM by the number of users, or for a specifiedperiod of time," said Tracy Scott, president of FolioCorp.  "Now we can extend those capabilities to meterinformation on a per-transaction basis, which willallow users to only pay for what they use.  This willopen up new markets for publishers in cases wheretheir information has been prohibitively expensive orotherwise impractical for use by small companies andothers who, for one reason or another, do notcurrently buy subscription-based informationproducts."A la Carte Charging Solves Problems      The ability to charge users on an a la cartebasis over the Internet solves several problems.First, by offering discrete segments of data,companies can price their products lower, which allowsthem to expand their markets.  A la carte also allowsinformation to be priced according to its intrinsicvalue, instead of valued generically by subscription.A longer feature or study printed in REC, forinstance, can be priced differently from a round ofnews briefs.      The CCC partnership will allow companies thatadopt the Folio metering API to link into the right'sdatabase of more than 1.7 million publications.Through that link, and with access controls providedby companies such as Wave Systems, Infobase SystemsInc. and CD-MAX (each of which has announced supportfor the API) users can be positively identified, theiraccess limited to areas for which they have rights andtheir use of products tracked for billing.  Connectionto the CCC enables the holders of copyrights to becompensated based upon the specific content accessed.      "In most cases, traditional print publishers andauthors have been unwilling to release theircopyrighted materials in digital form without adequateprotection of their copyrights," said Joseph S. Alen,president and chief executive officer at CCC.  "Byproviding both technological and contractual controls,the Folio/CCC relationship promises to dramaticallyincrease the flow of digital information from rightsholders to users."      For Web-based applications, Folio is using asecure server technology developed with Open MarketInc. (see story, p. 3).  The product is in betatesting now and is expected to be commerciallyavailable by early summer for $6,995.  The Folio WebServer will provide links to the CCC's database and aseparate system to be developed to provide clearancefor intellectual property not handled by the CCC.Secure links also will be provided to a third-partybilling service that will process transactions, butnot track the exact materials accessed to ensureanonymity of research performed over the network.Wave Systems Designed Encryption Chip      Wave Systems already has designed an encryptionchip around the Folio metering API, and has licensedit to VLSI Technology Inc. to manufacture the chips.Aside from electronic commerce applications, WaveSystems may use the technology to create rental orpay-per-view business models with the databasematerial, said Amelia Burkhart, Wave Systemsspokeswoman.  Wave Systems is working on applicationsthat will meter data usage and cut off access afterset periods of time, she said.      Initial metering API-compliant products will bereleased this year to meter local area networks andCD-ROM, with wide area network and Internet capabilityplanned for late this year and 1996.  Wave Systemsplans to have its private network chips ready byspring, with Internet and Web versions ready by theend of the year, according to Burkhart.      Although prices haven't been set, Wave Systemsexpects its chip to sell in the $100 range.  Whilehome users may not buy the chips as an add-on, Wave isworking on bundling arrangements with computercompanies, peripheral manufacturers and publishingcompanies, Burkhart said.

Medio has held discussions with Dewars scotch,which already advertises on the regular CD-ROMmagazine, and has approached retailers such asNordstrom, Macy's and Nike about selling products inan online marketplace being developed by the company,said John Rutter, Medio senior vice president of salesand marketing.  The online mall is likely to beavailable by August or September, he said.MedioNet Will Cost $9.95 First 2 Months      MedioNet, slated for a national launch laterthis year, will be priced at $9.95 for the first twomonths and $19.95 for the following months.  The pricetag includes a copy of the CD-ROM magazine to providethe software link, and 40 hours of Internet access.Medio launched a pilot Internet access network inSeattle, Wash., that eventually will use the company'sCD-ROM magazine as the front-end to reach theInternet.      This pricing model doubles the Internet time ofonline service Delphi Internet Service Corp. - $20 for20 hours - and gives Medio a dual revenue stream.  Thecompany will collect its basic Internet accesscharges, along with money from advertising on theCD-ROM magazine.  Linking MedioNet with the CD-ROMalso boosts the subscriber base for the magazine,which commonly is used to determine pricing structurefor advertising.  The magazine also is soldindividually through retail channels.Modem Speeds Up to 28.8 Kbps      MedioNet will support modem speeds up to 28.8kilobits per second, and is working with U.S. RoboticsInc., Digital Equipment Corp., Cisco Systems Inc.,Sprint Corp., NorthWestNet, Structured CommunicationsSystems Inc. and Teleport Communications Group toprovide the infrastructure for the Seattle system.      Medio is well positioned to create amultimedia-rich online market, becausememory-intensive audio and video clips can be storedon the company's CD-ROM for immediate access, leavingthe online connection free to transmit informationupdates and ordering commands quickly.      The actual ordering component will not includeonline credit card transactions in its initialrollout, Rutter said.  Medio takes credit card ordersfor its CD-ROM magazine over the phone, and thesenumbers will be used by the company to collect paymentfor online orders when the system is in place.Eventually, Medio wants to move to online credit cardorders, perhaps using an in-house system for securepayment, Rutter said.  But it is more likely thecompany will license a "name brand" secure transactiontechnology from another party, he added, which willmake consumers more comfortable ordering overMedioNet.      With the CD-ROM magazine becoming the front-endfor MedioNet, the company is working to boost thedisk's circulation before the service extendsnationally this summer.  This week, Creative Labsordered 100,000 copies of next month's magazine tosend to its customers that register their multimediaupgrade kits, Rutter said.  This registrationincentive boosts Medio's circulation to 150,000.Rutter expects Creative to order a similar amountevery quarter.

But the system that health care supply giantBaxter International Inc. is implementing puts an evennewer spin on CD-ROM-based electronic commerce -Baxter is using electronic data interchange (EDI)technology over proprietary networks as thetransmission medium instead of the Internet or one ofthe online services.      This week, Baxter announced it was replacing itsold Analytical Systems Automated Purchasing (ASAP)hospital procurement system in favor of the OnCall*EDIsystem developed by TSI International Ltd.  Baxterwill phase out its ASAP support by the end of 1996.Transition Forces Hospitals' Transition      Baxter's transition to OnCall*EDI all but forcesmost of the 6,000 hospitals using the DOS-based ASAPto make the transition to the open x.12 standard TSIis marketing.  Baxter's health care division providesmedical supplies to more than 4,000 of the country'sestimated 6,600 hospitals, according to Bob Bouton,TSI vice president of marketing.      Using a CD-ROM version of Baxter's Source 2000catalog created by Automated Catalog Services L.P.,hospitals can search through images and text of 80,000hospital products and place the EDI order right fromthe disk.  The TSI system is windows-based, andhospitals can zoom in on product images along withordering by pointing and clicking.      The two-way connection allows Baxter to provideimmediate price updates to the disk, and speeds up theprocurement process for the hospital.  Down the road,an automatic payment system will be built intoOnCall*EDI, allowing hospitals to link theirpurchasing with accounting systems for immediateverification and delivery of funds, Bouton said.      "CD-ROM catalogs in a lot of ways offer benefitsover online catalogs," said Torrey Byles, director ofelectronic commerce for market research firm BISStrategic Decisions.  "This type of system is veryquickly going to become widely used in other areas."      TSI already has shipped a few hundred OnCall*EDIplatforms to Baxter, which is reselling the units tohospitals it services, and Bouton expects hundreds offurther orders to come through in the next six to ninemonths.      Moving away from the proprietary ASAP systemalso will benefit Baxter's competitors, which will beable to tap into the OnCall*EDI system with theirCD-ROM product catalogs.  Aside from manufacturing itsown brand, Baxter also distributes competing productsfrom other companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, andthe new ordering system will provide a more levelplaying field for manufacturers that want to targethospitals directly.

The Industry.Net Online Marketplace allowsmanufacturers to place product and price informationonline for industry buyers to browse and collectinformation.  About 3,300 companies promote productson the service.  They pay between $450 a month and$40,000 per year for the privilege, depending on thesize of the electronic display and how many regions ofthe country the companies want to reach, Industry.Netspokeswoman Autumn Jones said.100,000 'Buying Members' Use Service      About 100,000 "buying members" access theservice to examine products from "selling members"such as IBM Corp., Rockwell, Honeywell and AlanBradley.  In addition to product information, theservice includes industry news briefs, discussiongroups and electronic mail to send questions tocompanies displaying their products.      Although the new Web service is strictlyinformational, within three months Industry.Net willadd the capability to conduct online purchasing, Jonessaid.  It still is undetermined whether ordering willinvolve receiving a purchase order number for laterbilling by regular mail, or will allow credit cardorders to be transmitted over the Web.  Industry.Netuses servers from Netscape Communications Corp., whichwould allow for an easy switch to Netscape's securecommerce technology.      After watching the information revolution takingplace throughout the corporate world, themanufacturing community slowing is beginning to takenotice of the potential for electronic commerce tofacilitate purchasing and other business-to-businesstransactions.      At National Manufacturing Week's Design Showlast week, the spot where Industry.Net premiered theWeb service was the only booth with a connection tothe Internet, Jones said.  But the low-tech days ofmanufacturing communication may be coming to an end.      Aside from online markets such as Industry.Net,CD-ROM catalogs also are becoming a popular method toconvey parts catalogs and price information to buyersand other vendors (see story, p. 12).      While CD-ROMs allow for snappier multimediapresentations, online trading floors have theadvantage of immediate ordering and price updating.Industry.Net's Web site has been running as a trialfor about a month and has received about 60,000logons, Jones said.

Interactive Network Inc. (IN) and NTNCommunications Inc. announced an out-of-courtsettlement March 6, ending at least part of adecadelong dispute over technology allowing home usersto play games and win prizes from set-top boxes,personal computers and gaming systems.      Although terms of the settlement were notdisclosed by either party, the arrangement isbasically an "I'll go one way, you go another" deal,in which neither side will sanction the other'sproducts.  As representatives from both partiesstated, no licenses changed hands.      The two companies have been locked in disputesover IN's interactive gaming patent.  Although a 1987settlement gave NTN a worldwide, royalty-free licenseon the technology, the company wanted to introduceevidence that the patent actually was taken fromtechnology developed at NTN originally.  IN denied theclaim, and a court ruled last November NTN could notsue because of the terms of the 1987 settlement.  Thislatest settlement puts to rest questions on whetherIN's "IN The Huddle" football game infringes on NTN'sproprietary "QB1" football game.      Although the companies still are in dispute onother areas of the patent, IN now will offer "IN TheHuddle" to its 5,500 network users in its five testmarkets.  With this legal hurdle out of the way, IN ishoping to raise money to continue its market trials,said Dave Lockton, IN chairman and chief executiveofficer.

The golden master of the disc will be deliveredto the manufacturer in the first week of May, withshipments occurring shortly thereafter, Minigan toldREC.  For now, the service, which also is available onAOL, is scheduled to be updated twice a year.      The disc will contain fewer than 26 catalogs,the number that appeared in the premiere issue, hesaid, but each catalog will contain more information.The change is due, in part, to market researchfollowing on the release of the first disc last year.      "People wanted fewer catalogs but moremerchandise from each," he said, declining to name thenew catalogs that will be added to the service.Current offerings include Crutchfield, Land's End, TheLearning Company, The Nature Company, The SharperImage and Sony Music.      Other improvements in 2Market's next issue willbe a simpler method of ordering merchandise over amodem, Minigan said.

MovieFone revenues totaled $22.6 million in1994, up from $13.5 million the year before.  At thesame time, the company's losses were cut to $1.9million from $2.2 million in 1993.      MovieFone is riding into profitability on theback of a national expansion campaign.  In 1994, thecompany received 33.3 million calls to its service,which provides updated information on where movies areplaying in local areas, and also allows consumers topurchase tickets in advance.      While 95 percent of calls were for informationrather than transactional purposes, MovieFone expectspurchasing to increase as the company offers othertransmission methods, company spokesman Andrew Jeskesaid.      A new kiosk service called MovieLink is beingtested quietly in a few cities throughout the country,including New York and Los Angeles.  The interactivekiosks use video clips to preview movies, andMovieFone is experimenting with purchasing capability.      The company also is exploring using its existingWeb site as a foundation for online movie informationand ticket sales, but both of these projects are stillbeing tested, Jeske said.

Although the set-top boxes would be built on an "open-access" basis for "variousprogramme providers", he added, it was clear BSkyB would have firstbite of the cherry depending on when and how it goes digital.  The newjoint-venture would be able to produce boxes for satellite, cable orterrestrial digital markets with equal facility.The new partnership follows NTL's 1994 alliance with Pace, whichresulted in the first generation of Pace-NTL digital receivers nowreaching markets worldwide.  Unlike Pace, however, Mitsubishi is notforming a joint venture company with DMV.  The Pace-NTL joint venture -to be renamed Pace-DMV - is not affected by the new venture.DMV boss Mike Windram said alliances with other manufacturers andbroadcasters had been "key to the successful introduction of the newdigital technology - we intend to increase our investment in thedevelopment of transmission and receiver technology and this type ofpartnership is vital for DMV."Though a late entrant into the European analogue satellite market withintegrated TV/IRDs, Mitsubishi signalled its intention of being amainstream digital player with the opening of its Visual Imagingresearch labs in London last summer.  Its six European factoriesinclude an advanced semiconductor fabrication plant which is likely tobe the source of decoder chips.Thomas the Tank Engine arrives at Cartoon NetworkTop kids' station Cartoon Network is chuffed to be showing Thomas theTank Engine & Friends.

South Africa's Customs and Excise has a R330,000claim to certain assets as security for their claims.  In short, Fisherreckoned that ordinary creditors "don't have any chance" of recoveringanything from the ruins, unless a buyer comes forward before theliquidation hearing on January 31.Eurosat - itself "a substantial creditor" - has transferred itsfranchise to Grundig International Pty.  Sid Trickett, who said he had"personally lost R5.5 million" in the collapse, has been contracted byGrundig to develop the satellite business.Prior to the collapse, Trickett had signed a deal to handle Grundig'sdigital IRD distribution.  Grundig planned to use badged Panasonic IRDs- but on December 15 "the factory had burnt down".Satellite Communications' original dish-making business "died a naturaldeath with the arrival of PAS-4", especially as the onset of Ku-Bandcoincided with a steep rise in world prices of aluminium."For a while analogue Ku-Band kept us going, but when the ASEC servicesfrom Intelsat 704 shut down, that side came to a screeching halt aswell."Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

It could become the biggest problemfacing DBS.  The only reason that it is not widespread is because thereis a worldwide chip shortage right now and I think that is holding downdistribution."Jim Shelton of Shelton and Associates, a San Diego-based consultingfirm agrees with Sherman.  "The only reason that it is not widespreadat this time is probably a shortage of computer chips.  A lot of thesechips require a 26 week lead time." Sherman previously worked atGeneral Instrument's San Diego-based Videocipher division where hehelped end signal piracy on C-Band dishes.At the moment, experts believe that there are only between 5,000 to10,000 black market DBS decoder cards in operation, but Sheltonbelieves it is only a matter of time before the piracy mushrooms.  "Itcould become rampant.  Once they have plenty of cards, you will seeadvertising break out in flyers and faxes offering the cards.  If itcontinues unchecked, it won't be long before you see them manufacturing100,000 receiving units a month, but only 50,000 are being legallyauthorised." The black market access cards are being sold for between$500-700.DirecTv president Eddy Hartenstein has claimed that he is two stepsahead of the hackers and that he can foil them with electroniccountermeasures or by issuing new decoder cards.  Both Shelton andSherman believe the problem will continue to grow.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

A number of receivers, including Pace IRDs have been affected byproblems ranging from an annoying audible tone and an unwarranted "CardInvalid" on-screen message.Technical author Martin Pickering says the problem clearly lies withthe card rather than individual receivers.When tape is placed over the black dot "Card Invalid" appears on everyreceiver.  The contact carries the 3.5MHz clock pulses and acts as a resistor.  Pickering estimates it tohave a value between 1 and 2k Ohms.  As the black spot is worn away theproblem becomes worse.By cutting the circuit track which leads to the relevant "black dot"card holder contact, and soldering a 2k2 resistor across the cut trackthe problem is apparently cured.The same modification has been carried out on other PRD receivers, allof which have been cured.  It is not known whether or not the cure willwork on other receivers.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TRADER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOUInternational news channel BBC World has been on-air for 12 months, butits presence in the UK is deliberately hidden, writes Julian CloverSometimes it feels as if everyone wants to run a news channel; CNNInternational has been on-air for ten years and satellite viewers cantune into news broadcasts from Berlin, Paris, London and Lyon.1995 saw a new crop with the launch of European Business News, CNBCEurope and BBC World, the latter formed out of BBC World ServiceTelevision, which had broadcast to Asia as part of Star TV.  In Europethe news channel had been carried overnight on the old entertainmentservice.The BBC Europe channel from the Intelsat 27.5oW location had evolvedout of a rough mix of BBC1 and BBC2, the result of a demand for Englishlanguage programmes from Scandinavian cable companies.  This in turnpicked up more than a passing interest from DTH viewers who tuned intothe easily hacked Save transmissions before a switch to D2 Mac wasmade.  DTH subscriptions for BBC Prime, again for outside the UK, arehandled by the Swedish subscriber management service TV Extra.Listeners to short wave will be more than familiar with some of thetitles given to BBC World's extended news programmes; BBC Newsdesk,Newshour and Newsroom would not look out of place coming from BushHouse instead of Television Centre.  The feature programmes also have afamiliar ring about them; Breakfast with Frost, Film '96,Correspondent, and Panorama, including that royal interview.The European feed from Eutelsat II F1 is transmitted from the Maxatuplink at Teddington, where advertisements sold by the BBCWorldwide/Pearson/Cox Communications joint venture company EuropeanChannel Management are also added.  The spaces are filled by the"Highlights In.  .  ." trailers while the rest of the world catches up. "We're selling enough airtime now that at the Teddington uplink moreand more of the ads go over the previews," explains ECM managingdirector Marcus Bicknell.  "If it's a four minute break which we'vesold two minutes of, then the other two minutes are on-air promotions,promotion of teletext and promotion of specific European stuff withoutthe Bangkok and Tokyo times."After working as a consultant during the start up of BBC World and thenow rebranded entertainment channel BBC Prime Bicknell, the foundercommercial director of SES and previously marketing director at TheChildren's Channel and the old UK film channel Premiere, joined ECM inJune last year.  His style is anything other than what is expected froma BBC executive, but there again ECM is run as a private company fromprivate capital not encroaching on the domestic licence fee.The past 12 months since the launch have concentrated more or less onBBC Prime.  Fine tuning the mix of current and classic BBC and Thamesprogrammes into a selection more suitable for the European palate.Prime is not a channel for ex-pats: EastEnders gets a regular showingin line with BBC1, while other popular dramas such as Casualty as shownoften within a few weeks of their domestic screening.  Purchased filmsare missing from the schedule as are sports programmes Grandstand andMatch of the Day.  Over the past few months Prime has introduced astripped schedule with regular slots for specific programme genres.This year BBC World will receive the treatment starting on January 1with the introduction of the long awaited teletext service.  "What wehad previously was an anachronism which was basically a feed fromCeefax which went on the BBC World Service Television European service. It continued on Prime because the server just happened to be there."Difficulties arose from bought in information which the BBC did nothave the rights to with the providers demanding payment.  The newservice, provided by the private company Intelfax, rather than Ceefax,will eventually feature news, business, travel and of course a detailedprogramme guide for the two services.  Both Prime and World will be thesubject of a major advertising campaign this year.Across on Intelsat 601 BBC Prime continues to broadcast in D2 Mac.  Itsmovement to Eutelsat 13 degrees being unlikely while there is no singleencryption system capable of reaching the whole of Europe.The digital horizon however paints a more attractive option.  AlreadyBBC World is part of the MultiChoice package in South Africa and it isreasonable to expect that BBC World, and probably Prime, would finditself as part of the MultiChoice packages in Europe.  Britain willremain firmly off the agenda; there are no rights held for the UKmarket and in any case the BBC's news and current affairs directoratehas ambitions for a domestic news channel as part of a terrestrialdigital multiplex."We get hundreds of calls a week from people interested in Prime, weget very low conversion because when they find it's on Intelsat with a1.2 metre dish and in D2 Mac Eurocrypt M.  .  .I haven't inherited themost glamorous distribution policy in the world," pines Bicknell.Distribution difficulties are coupled with a pricing policy whichrequires DTH subscribers to pay the equivalent to #70 per month whilecable viewers enjoy the channel as part of a wider extended basicpackage.  "It's an unfair accident of technology, satellites andencryption and we're trying to correct it.  What you'll see when thedigital packages roll out is World moving off and getting maximumpenetration and by the end of 1996 it would be very attractive forsomebody to get both channels from the same dish." Digital will allow further expansion; opt-outs in programming wherebyAsia would get its own dedicated programming while the rest of theworld continues with the standard service.  Such opt outs would beextended to allow the programme packagers to take their own individualslots.  "Part of being relevant to a non-Anglo Saxon target audience isto know what individual programmes have got to say." This manifestsitself in the new Window on the World programme produced in Germany byS-Zett-Magazin which currently contributes to Vox.  Initially theprogramme will be transmitted with an English soundtrack only, butalready there are plans to introduce a separate German audio channel.7.02 MHz will be used for English and 7.20MHz for German, there are noplans to introduce any further languages in Europe.With the European audience in mind other new programmes have recentlybeen added to the World schedule; Europe Today appears as a six toeight minute segment in the three principal news magazines BBCNewsdesk, BBC Newsday and The World Today.  The Asian Continent alsogets its own breakfast news briefing, BBC although the transmissiontime of 01.00 to 04.00GMT means BBC Newsroom will be viewed only by themost hardy European viewer.By the end of 1996 14 million homes had access to BBC World, a mix ofDTH from Eutelsat and cable operators in Europe, the latter bolsteredby interest from the Netherlands and Germany where a terrestrialfrequency in Berlin is also a possibility.  "The channel is good, it isin depth and it goes that bit further," boasts Bicknell.  Typically anews channel will be viewed for between 12 and 18 minutes, whereas BBCWorld is between 24 and 35.  "This means that somebody will watch the25 minutes news, they'll stay for an ad break, or they're watching TimeOut; Tomorrow's World, Film '96 plus the headlines." This has been adelight for the advertisers, who are also tumbling to the fact that BBCWorld is the first BBC branded channel to carry advertising in thefirst place.Despite all the success in Europe BBC World will remain forever closedto the UK viewer despite presently being in-the-clear from Eutelsat;"Certainly if I was talking to a CAI conference I would warn them thatit would start decaying in time because it would never be in a UKdigital package." The Eutelsat feed will remain `for the foreseeablefuture' and the implication is that BBC Prime would be first to vanishfrom the analogue environment within a few years.Contact points: European Channel Management Tel: 0181 576 3061; TVExtra (Sweden) Tel: +46 141 56060Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

The conversion isproving particularly popular with the Asian community in Europe wherenew subscribers to Zee TV are being issued with the VC2 card.  It workswith all receivers with the exception of the Echostar 8700 where theconversion does not fit.The conversion is made by removing the IW03 and IW05 chips insertingthe kit, then replacing the two chips into new positions.  Quantum hasbeen supplied with its chips by the VideoCrypt proprietary rightsholder Thomson.  Once fitted it remains possible to continue viewingchannels using both VideoCrypt I and VideoCrypt II codes.  Where achannel is transmitting two codes the conversion will always opt forthe VideoCrypt I code.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

The effects are selectablefrom an additional on-screen menu, and the IRD can be connected up to ahi-fi system to maximise the three-dimensional sound impact.  The unitcan also be used for stereo VCR playback to add pseudo-surroundeffrects to videos.The MSS 290 is set to retail at #229, with the enhanced audio systemlikely to be heavily promoted as an added-value feature to persuadepunters to trade up from the all-pervasive under-#100 Astra system.Pace also intends to incorporate Stereo 3D into certain export models,but will retain Dolby Pro Logic for its top-of-the-range MSS1000series.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

AsimHussein explains how to track them downSatellite system installers, broadcasters and viewers are fortunatebecause a large proportion of the satellites that beam TV back to Earthare in stable geostationary orbits.  However, what about receivingsignals from that increasing number of satellites that seem to fade inand out every day or which simply can't be located at times?The reason may be that the required satellite has an inclined orbit.Inclined that is, to the plane of the usual geostationary arc.  In thesatellite operating industry the concept of allowing satellites to moveis not new.  In the '80s the Intelsat 5 craft were all in such orbits,and at the same time USA operator Comsat began regular inclined-orbitoperations and coined the other name for such heavenly wandering - theComsat Manoeuvre.Why is this done ? It lengthens the life of satellites by savinghydrazine fuel.  Most satellites are maintained in position by thefiring of the propulsion engines for North-South and East-West station-keeping, leaving the bird within about 100km of the nominal position.If this is not done every few weeks the natural gravitational forces ofthe sun and moon gradually, though imperceptibly at first, force thesatellite into an inclined plane orbit by about 0.8 degrees each year.The rocket propellant saved can be used to maintain East-West station-keeping within 0.1 degree but not for North-South, allowing thesatellite to move up and down.When viewed from the earth or received with a satellite dish, aninclined-orbit satellite no longer hangs in the sky as an apparentlystationary object.  It's pattern of movement is a definite `figure 8'pattern that repeats every 24 hours unless a motor is fired to correctit.  (Satellites at the edge of the arc that are inclined still executean `8' pattern, but in the higher latitudes this is skewed).  Thebenefits of fuel conservation and a longer operational life have a downside, because inclined orbits mean tracking problems for satelliteinstallations on Earth.Other effects are that the footprint illuminated by an inclined orbitsatellite varies too, this can cause signal fluctuation.  SCPC, anarrow band signal type, is even affected by Doppler shift, as thevelocity of the satellite changes so does the received frequency eg Asatellite inclined by 2 degrees changes frequency by a maximum of1.5kHz.Polar cappedOne dealer has kept his eye on the ball and on these moving satellites. Smallworld Satellite of Birmingham has put together a winningcombination of the TSS Inclined Orbit Polar-mount, for which it hassole UK distribution and the very latest 1500 channel ChaparralMonterey 140 receiver-positioner.  Ordinary polar-mounts allow trackingacross the East-West arc but the TSS mount can be moved in elevationtoo (up and down to you and me).  This is achieved through some ruggedgalvanised steel metalwork and roller bearings which allow twoactuators to be attached, one for each plane of movement.  Control ofeach actuator could be achieved by the use of a receiver positioner andan additional positioner.  However, the smart consumer will opt for theeasy option, which is to use the Monterey 140.  The flagship receiverhas an inclined interface unit built-in and the effects were mostimpressive.ST was shown how a satellite position can be stored within thereceiver's memory.  On returning to that nominal position from anothersatellite, the receiver stops.  It tracks East and West slightly topeak the signal, but if the satellite has moved it will track the dishup and then down, until a signal is traced.  It will then peak again,side to side for optimum signal and repeat the process until a peak isobtained.Once locked onto a satellite, the receiver can be programmed to checkthat maximum signal is being achieved by tracking imperceptibly in eachdirection, without disrupting the signal.  This check can occur atregular intervals with a time delay of one to 60 minutes.When we used the system it was hooked up to a 2.5 metre prime focusdish situated at Smallworld's showroom and roof-top dish site inBirmingham, just off the M6 motorway.  We observed the Russian C-BandTV signals from the wobbly 11 degrees West and 40 degrees Eastsatellites - they were tracked accurately and without a break.  Whenthe feed-horn was covered and tracking lost, the receiver caused thetwo motors to track and signal was restored within a few seconds.At the more usual Ku-Band, the higher frequency means that thebeamwidth, the tiny angle over which any satellite can be receivedbefore it fades, is much reduced.  The test dish had a beamwidth of 0.8between the 6dB signal points (see table 2).  A 6dB decrease in signalstrength is enough of a loss for signal near threshold to becomeunwatchable.  However, even dishes of one metre diameter, with a beam-width of nearer 1.5, suffer when Ku-Band satellites are inclined.  Justtry following a feed on the Eutelsat I F4 at 25.5 degrees, which movesthrough a massive 4.2 degrees each day.  This system is a boon toanyone wishing to track the satellites listed in our table 1 or for thelow elevation satellites that most polar mounts miss.The TSS Inclined Polarmount can be used with a variety of dishes likeTrac, Triax, Precision, Channel Master suitable for adaptation.Smallworld recommends an optical actuator arm for accurate North-Southtracking without backlash (hysteresis).  Besides the Monterey 140, someother receivers such as Drake and Echostar can use the TSS mount.Malcolm Titmus, Smallworld's proprietor can supply and install systemsfor inclined orbit operation, normal multi-satellite systems and fixeddish installations.  An inclined system has been installed at aprofessional TV broadcaster's site; they no longer have to worry aboutlosing signal at a critical moment.  This was all achieved at thefraction of the cost of previous tracking systems.  The TSS InclinedTracking Polarmount starts at #299.Contact Point: Smallworld Satellite and Audio-Visual Supplies, ShowroomUnit , 212 The Telsen Centre, Thomas Street, Aston, Birmingham B6 6TN.Tel: 0121 359 8016Satellites with 0.1 degrees inclination and abovePosition      +/-       Satellite           Band63oW          0.9       Brazilsat           C46oW          2.2       TDRS 6              C, Ku40.3oW        6.0       Intelsat 502        C, Ku31.4oW        4.0       Intelsat 506        C, Ku21.3oW        1.4       Intelsat 512        C, Ku16oW          3.4       Cosmos 2054         Ku10.8oW        1.2       Gorizont 26         C, Ku3oE           0.3       Telecom 1C          C, Ku20oE          1.7       Arabsat 1DR         C21.5oE        1.2       Eutelsat I F5       Ku25.5oE        2.1       Eutelsat I F4       Ku26oE          3.0       Gorizont 20         C, Ku34oE          4.3       Gorizont 17         C, Ku40oE          2.7       Gorizont 22         C, Ku47oE          4.5       Intelsat 507        C, Ku48oE          5.2       Eutelsat I F1       Ku53oE          0.9       Gorizont 27         C, Ku57oE          2.7       Intelsat 510        C, Ku64.9oE        5.1       Intelsat 505        C, Ku70oE          3.9       Raduga 2            C70oE          0.8       Raduga 32           C71.4oE        0.1       Gals 2              Ku80oE          1.8       Gorizont 24         C, Ku85oE          2.1       TDRS 3              C, Ku87.5oE        2.1       DongFangHong 22     C91.5oE        6.5       Intelsat 501        C, Ku96.5oE        3.7       Gorizont 19         C, Ku103oE         1.5       Gorizont 25         C, Ku130oE         0.2       Gorizont 29         C, Ku-6 db beam-width of satellite dishesDiameter   At 12 GHz   At 3.8 GHzmetres     Ku-Band     C-Band1.0        2.0         6.42.5        0.8         2.65.0        0.4         1.310.0       0.2         0.7Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Rob Ulrich took the new babyhome to play.Currently there's a great demand for low cost receivers to be used asfixed systems.  However, low cost usually means back to basics: pooraudio and video quality and no extra features like an on-screendisplay, VCR timers, low threshold, etc.  What about the M60e? is theChaparral M60e a real basic product? Chaparral usually stands for hightech and top quality, so has San Jose's finest sold out?Chaparral is one of the leading manufacturers of LNBs, polarisers andhigh-end satellite receivers.  At last year's Cable & Satellite showChaparral introduced the e-series providing low cost receivers for bothfixed and steerable systems.  Amsterdam's The Satellite Shop (TSS)recently introduced the first model in the series, the M60e.  TSS isthe sole distributor for Europe for this receiver.Design-wise M60e is very familiar.  The designers chose the samestyling as their previous creation, the Monterey 140.  The M60e is amid-sized satellite receiver, especially designed for fixed dishes.  Afour-digit LED-display is located on the front panel, as well as somesmall buttons for channel up/down, volume and standby.  The back panelis a surprise - Chaparral has introduced Scart sockets for connecting adecoder and a VCR.  There are also phono outputs for audio, video andbaseband plus quick-fit connectors for an external 12 Volt device and amechanical polariser.  On both LNB inputs several LNB types can beconnected.  Not only LNBFs, such as a quatroband or an Astra UniversalLNBF, but also standard C and Ku-Band LNBs.  The M60e can also be usedin any multifeed or C/Ku-Band system.The frequency range of the M60e runs from 950 to 2050MHz while the IFbandwidth can be adjusted to 27, 18, 15 or 13MHz.  When choosing 13 or15MHz the internal threshold extender is also activated.  Anothersurprise on the M60e is the absence of an original Wegener audiocompander, a feature which always has been part of Chaparral receivers. The M60e is equipped with the Philips TDA 8741 chip - effectively thenext best thing to Wegener.  The audio channels are tuneable betweenfive and nine MHz and there are two audio IF bandwidths (150/330kHz).The M60e has an easy to use on-screen display for (re-) programming the200 channels.  The distributor has already programmed the channels withthe most popular stations on Astra and Eutelsat, but if you want tochange them all are freely programmable.Pressing the Menu key on the remote control brings up the first on-screen display menu page on the screen.  This menu page includes theevent timer, parental lock, copy mode, channel erase, frequency offsetand data transfer.  The event timer allows nine events to be recordedover a period of four weeks.  Nine of the 200 channels can be stored asfavourites.  With the data transfer option the memory of one M60e canbe transferred to another M60e.  When menu key is pressed again, thesecond menu page appears.  With this menu we can change the frequency,LNB input, polarity (when a LNBF is connected) or skew (when using amechanical polariser), deviation and activate the internal 22kHzgenerator for band switching with a quatroband LNBF.  The frequencydisplayed on the menu is the IF frequency, in Normal (Ku-Band) modebetween 950 and 2050MHz, in Invert (C-Band) mode between 3100 and4200MHz.  The third menu page (yes, after pressing on Menu again) isthe audio menu.  With this menu the audio frequency, de-emphasis andbandwidth can all be adjusted.In our testlab, we connected the M60e to an 80cm and a 1.40m dish toget an impression of the video quality.  A Videotek video monitor wasused to provide information about the video.  The chroma delay of theM60e is good compared to many other quality receivers.  Looking at thepicture more closely, we discovered less video noise than found onother receivers.  Our overall impression of the video quality was verygood.But what about the sound quality? As we said, the M60e is the firstChaparral receiver without an original Wegener compander.  Comparing itto, for instance, the Monterey 140 is not fair.  The M60e produces anice sound, but of course not as transparent as the Monterey 140.That's why the price is low.  Besides that, only real Wegenercompanders can reproduce the best Wegener sound.  The thresholdextender of the M60e expands the amount of weak signals which can bereceived.  We did some experiments on Nile TV on Eutelsat II F3.Without using the threshold extender, we could only see a picturecovered with sparklies.  But when the bandwidth was switched to 13MHz,Nile TV appeared on the screen minus the sparklies! We had the sameexperience with the CMT signal on Intelsat 601 and some C-Band signalson both Intelsat 702 and Arabsat 1C.  The quality of the picture issurprisingly good.  Imagine what can happen with these signals whenusing a 3m dish! Without any doubt the M60e is a very interestingreceiver for the Middle East and African countries, where the signalstrength is lower than in Europe.In Europe the M60e can be used for receiving almost every satellitesignal.  After connecting several decoders (Pace VC100, Philips BDE 353and Luxcrypt) the picture was as good as that on unencrypted signals.It took only a few seconds until the decoders were activated.The Chaparral M60e is an interesting and easy to use receiver with someunique features.  We tried this impressive receiver on both C and Ku-Band systems.  The threshold extender impressed and gave a bigadvantage on weak signals, such as Nile TV on Eutelsat II F3.  Thequality of both video and audio was good, exactly what we might expectfrom Chaparral.  Most surprising is the price.  The new small Chaparralreceiver will retail for only #199.Contact Point: The Satellite Shop TSS.  Tel: +31 72 5746228; Fax: +3172 5746248Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Touchlinereporter Julian Clover looks at who has the top events and finds Sky isnot the only place to watch the premiership.Each year there are key events which stand out in the sporting calendarand every year satellite television, or should that read Sky, helpsitself to more of them.  There is no doubting the pulling power ofPremiership Football, World Cup Cricket or Formula 1 motor racing toencourage that purchasing decision.Sky continues to add to its sports roster to the frustration of theterrestrial channels, and assorted backbench MPs, while Eurosport isoften able to supplement network television with extended coverage ofevents such as Formula 1 alongside its own exclusives.  FilmNet has nowspun off Supersport as a standalone channel in both the Benelux andNordic countries, though this will only be available to the few able toaccess digital transmissions.  Sportkanalen, in D2 Mac, will join thevirtually free-to-air package at five degrees East in March.Super Sunday and Monday Night Football have become key fixtures inthemselves throughout the football season and will be joined in theautumn by fixtures from the Endsleigh League.  Sky claims that thiswill cover all three divisions and not just the clubs in Division One.Full Saturday afternoon coverage of every game on the Premiershipprogramme may have to wait until digital makes its UK debut, butScandinavian viewers can already tune in.  Saturday afternoons on NRK(in clear D Mac from Intelsat 702) or TV2 (encrypted in D2 Mac).  Theseare typically the matches being taped for BBC1's Match of the Day laterthat evening.  TV Pluss also shows delayed matches from around18.00CET.  Sweden's TV4 from Sirius also has the rights to screenSaturday afternoon matches.FilmNet and SuperSport subscribers can also view English Premiershipmatches, normally screened simultaneously with Sky, although Mondaynight matches on FilmNet 1 (formerly FilmNet Plus) are normally timedelayed by about an hour.  FilmNet/SuperSport's commitment to footballalso takes in coverage of the Dutch, Italian and German leagues,according to which version you watch.  FilmNet (Central Europe) fromAstra in VideoCrypt II continues to screen occasional local matchesfrom Poland.SuperSport is currently available as a standalone channel on cable toBelgium, Holland and Scandinavia.  It's distributed by satellite indigital format from Astra and Intelsat 601.  Availability will increasein line with the roll-out of digital reception equipment.Naturally the German broadcasters have extensive coverage of theBundesliga; Sat1 follows the fortunes in its programme Ran.  GermanInternation-als are typically live on ARD or ZDF.  Channel 4's Italianfootball feed can be found on Eutelsat II F3 while the sole purpose ofRai Tre's Sunday only broadcasts are for the late night round up of theweekend's matches.Rugby Super League coverage begins on March 29 as the Sheffield Eaglestravel to France to play the newly formed Paris team.  Sky is promisingto screen every Super League club at least twice in the first twomonths of the season.Eurosport's great strength lies in its ability to stay with an eventand nothing will be more true this summer when it provides 24 hourcoverage of the Olympic Games in Atlanta.  In addition to continuingFormula One coverage Eurosport will screen live each round of theIndycar World Series.  British drivers Mark Blundell and Johnny Herberthave both been offered drives.  The Motorcycle Grand Prix season willalso be shown in full, live and exclusive.Slightly slower bicycles, though not by far, will be on display in theTour de France.  Eurosport will also be screening European PGA Golf,Equestrian World Cup and the Ice Hockey World Cup.The Racing Channel continues to cover typically two, sometimes threerace meetings daily.  This is supplemented by the return of eveningracing in Sky Sports The Winning Post, produced by The Racing Channelalongside the early morning Racing News.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TRADER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996DOING IT BY THE BOOKInstallation practices need tightening up now that digital is on theway, writes Bill CollinsIt is no secret that the world of television and radio is headingtowards digital, raising new issues in respect of installationpractice.  To help installers, Astra will soon be publishing a newGuide to Professional Dish Installation which is specifically designedto address these issues.  The original brochure, which has proved verypopular since its original publication in 1993, contains tips andreminders on how to avoid problems when installing analogue satellitesystems.  The new guide is concerned not only with the practicalitiesof satellite dish installation but also understanding the differencesthat digital will make and helping installers to avoid the pitfalls.Digital transmission relies on a different modulation technique to theearlier analogue satellite signals whose modulation was different toterrestrial broadcasts.  These differences are important for installersin that they create different reactions to similar problems ininstallation.  A small error in cabling which can cause teletext drop-out on a terrestrial installation can cause sparklies on an analoguesatellite system.  The same error on a digital installation cancompletely obliterate the signal.Quadrature Phase Shift Key (QPSK) is the modulation technique used fortransmission of digital signals via satellite.  The reception of QPSKsignals depends fundamentally on the receiver recognising the phase ofthe incoming signal.  It follows that any defect in the receptionsystem that interferes with the signal phase will substantially degradethe reception.  A dictionary definition of phase is given as `Thatfraction of the period which has elapsed in a periodic function or wavemeasured from some fixed origin' Another way of looking at it is theposition along the peaks and troughs of a waveform.If the time for one period is represented as 360 degrees along a timeaxis, the phase position, at any particular moment, is called the phaseangle.  For example the phase angle at the position marked `X' inFigure 1 is 225 degrees.  Recognition of the phase angle is simplewhere the signal is clearly defined but any interference effects thatdisturb, or otherwise disguise, the phase can be the source of seriousproblems for digital reception.By far the most common cause of phase disturbance is mismatching in thesystem.  Impedance changes generate reflections of the main signal thatcan bounce backwards and forwards within a network.  These impedancechanges are known as mismatches.  The reflections show as standingwaves on the cable which, because they are of the samefrequency/wavelength as the original signal, will be combined by thereceiver and seen as a single waveform which may have completelydifferent characteristics to the original.A mismatch can be caused by a number of factors.  Physical damage tothe cable, poorly made connections, water ingress, or even just kinkingof the cable by making a bend too tight are all common causes ofmismatching.  Poor quality cable can show `ripple,' a kind of built inmismatch caused by low grade production machinery and methods, evenwith no induced faults caused during installationFigure 2 illustrates some of the effects of a mismatch.  When theoriginal signal reaches the mismatch point some of it is reflected backalong the cable.  One effect of this is to lower the signal levelinitially passing through the mismatch point to the receiver.  Secondlythe reflected signal passing back along the cable will generate furtherreflections at previous mismatches or even the connection at the signalorigin.  The phase, or peaks and troughs, of each of these reflectionswill have different positions to the original waveform.The resulting signal arriving at the receiver is a combination of boththe waveforms (a) and (b) at the right-hand side of the mismatch point. The amplitude, shape and phase of the signal seen by the receiver, asshown in Figure 3, can be radically different to the original.  By itsvery nature this article can only offer a simple illustration of whatis a very complex problem.  Within a satellite system the reflectionsand their standing waves are infinitely more complex than that shownhere.The effect on phase of even a single standing wave can be sufficient toprevent reception of a digital TV channel, but in a real installationthere may be a very large number of mismatch reflections combining atthe receiver.  Care and attention to detail and use of good qualitymaterials has always been the mark of the true professional.  This willbe even more applicable in the digital future than it is today.Whereas earlier modulation techniques were more forgiving in terms ofinstallation quality, digital allows little room for error.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TRADER via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996OPEN UP THE BOXIt's time to grab a screwdriver, and to prise the lid off the box tosee what's inside.  How are digital decoders organised and why do theycost as much as they do? Gwyn Morgan explains.In the last two articles we have taken a look at the theoretical sideof digital television, how vision and sound compression works and howthe `packets' of data are numbered and labelled in tables so that thedecoders know how to sort them out and put them into televisionservices.  Now it's time to open up the box and look inside.If we are talking about DTH digital satellite television then we reallyneed to start outside the house at the LNB attached to the dish whichin most cases will need to be changed for digital reception.  You canbroadcast digital services on almost any satellite using almost anyfrequency and all sorts of bandwidths from very narrow to very wide.But for Direct-to-Home consumer services virtually all the digitalchannels will be broadcast in the BSS (Broadcast Satellite Services)frequency bands.  So far we have been used to Astra and Eutelsatservices broadcast in the FSS range from 10.7 to 11.7 Gigahertz (GHz).Virtually all the LNBs installed until recent months will only workbetween this range of FSS frequencies.  The digital services willoperate at a higher frequency range from 11.7 to 12.75GHz.The extra frequencies are not the only reason that new LNBs are neededfor digital satellite reception.  Digital signals are rugged and canresist interference and noise very effectively but digital equipment ismuch more susceptible to "jitter" than analogue equipment.  Jitter, or"Phase Noise" is the equivalent of a continual small change infrequency caused by noise or lack of stability of the oscillator in theLNB.  Lack of stability might itself be caused by poor regulation ofthe low voltage power supply from the cable.The new Universal LNBs are now recommended for all satelliteinstallations.  They will receive all the analogue services that areavailable today but they will also tune to the BSS frequencies fordigital services when they arrive.  Universal LNBs will also providethe high stability, or low "phase noise" that is essential to feeddigital receivers.Once the signal lands inside the receiver the first thing it meets isthe tuner-demodulator.  A digital tuner/demodulator is rather differentfrom the analogue version.  It will probably look the same - a smallshiny tin box on the PCB - and in essence it will do much the sametask.  First it tunes to the correct carrier frequency for the serviceyou need and filters out one group or "multiplex" of digital servicesfrom a particular transponder on the satellite.  The digital data iscarried on the satellite signal using Quadrature Phase Shift Keying(QPSK) which is very loosely a digital equivalent of the FM (frequencymodulation) used for analogue services.  An analogue tuner/demodulatorwill not work for digital signals.  The digital QPSK demodulatorextracts the original Os and 1s that were inserted at the transmissionpoint.The next task for the tuner/demodulator is to remove the "Forward ErrorCorrection" a sort of digital equivalent of a postal jiffy bag.In the last article we saw how all the digital packets are sorted andlabelled and assembled into a "Transport Stream".  The transmissionpath from broadcaster to receiver can get very nasty with noise,interfering frequencies, fading and all the many disasters that thesignals encounter on the way.  So to keep the transport stream frombeing damaged beyond recognition it needs to be neatly packaged in itsdigital jiffy bag which naturally needs a suitably technical title.  Itis called Forward Error Correction because you add the correction databefore you transmit the signal, fully expecting that the signal isgoing to get pushed, punched and stamped on as it makes its way tothrough the airwaves.Forward error correction works in several different ways.  First itmixes up the order that the data is transmitted.  The chances are thatinterference will come as a burst of noise that comes and goes - justlike a noisy motorbike driving past your house.  If you mix up the bitsso that some of the early parts of the transmission are transmittednext to some of the later parts then the effect of the burst of noisewill be less noticeable because it will be spread out and will affectisolated parts of the transmission.  This technique is calledconvolutional coding.On its own mixing up the bits and changing their sequence is notenough.  You have to add extra data bits as well as mix up the data.The extra data lets the decoder do some simple arithmetic to check thatthe digital bits have been received correctly.  For example if I saidthat all the words I wrote would have a number after them (4) to (2)say (3) how (3) many (4) letters (7) there should be in each word youwould soon tell if something was incorrect (5) (= wrong).  The largerthe number of extra bits you add so the more errors you can correct butof course the transmission then becomes less efficient overall so thereis always a trade-off to make.When the decoder finds that some of the data has been corrupted on theway it does not have to give up and throw it away.  When it discoversthere are errors the arithmetic will not only let it correct some ofthe errors, but if things get really bad the decoder will make a bestguess at what the data should have been, using a technique calledViterbi.When the digital bits are flying in at a rate of tens of millions bitsper second then the forward error correction circuits in the decoder donot have much time to hang around.  This technology alone is a hightech function that needs specially dedicated, fast integrated circuits.But the fact that a digital receiver can correct lots of errors doesnot provide any leeway for poor installations.  In analogue FMtransmission you get some warning that reception might be poor becausethere is a relatively smooth slope as the signal becomes worse and thesparklies appear on the screen.  With digital technology it is morelike a cliff-edge than a slope.  Once you reach the point where thereceiver cannot cope with the errors the whole process suddenly comesto a halt without any real warning and that is much more disturbingthan a smooth onset of sparklies.  For that reason a good installationhas to provide a large margin above the point of failure so that signalfailure becomes a very rare event.So far we have barely got past the first part of the decoder and wehave already encountered some exotic technology.One transponder could be carrying eight or more programme services inthe "multiplex" or "transport stream" of data.  The next stage of thedecoder is called the de-multiplexer which picks out the particularitems that the viewer has chosen.  Assume the viewer chooses aparticular programme which will have a picture and stereo sound.  Thetables that are transmitted with the transport stream explain whichpacket numbers belong to which programme so when the viewer selects sayDiscovery then the demultiplexer might be told to find all the packetslabelled 72 for the vision and the packets labelled 24 for the sound.The demultiplexer is like the signal box in a railway shunting yardwhich sets the points to send some packets off to the vision circuitsand others off to the sound circuits but unlike a railway shunting yardit can throw away all the packets it does not need.Now things are much clearer because we have a stream of digital visionsignals and a stream of digital sound signals which belong to onetelevision service.The vision packets go to the vision decompression chip and the nextarticle will look at all this and all the other components that go tocreate a digital decoder.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Perfor-mance - The Arts Channel is todeliver to cable via this satellite too, using the NTL London uplink.Black Entertainment Television starts digital transmission here forcable distribution this year.27.5oW: Intelsat 601Temporary access to TCC and Discovery is now possible with a 1.2 metredish through much of Europe, the channels share 11055MHz horizontal,Tp.  72A.  This is a feed into Thor, besides main Swedish at 6.65MHzthere are four soundtracks for Scandinavia, 7.02MHz Norwegian, 7.20MHzDanish and 7.38MHz Finnish.  Transmissions are in clear Pal.  CMTEurope's signal looks like it has improved.3oE: Telecom 1C & 2CAriane Flight 81 did its job and Telecom 2C is already on station.Transfer of Ku-Band services is imminent and the use of the newhorizontal Ku-Band transponders at this location.  The disappearance ofthat old familiar Mulhouse Telecom 1 test-card, which has been withTelecom viewers for at least the last six years, will herald theoperational use of the new generation Telecom satellite.  Telecom 2C isalso a military communications spacecraft as it has the Syracuse 2system operating at 7/8GHz.  The actual launch from Kourou, FrenchGuiana, was at 2323GMT December 6.  Expect some digital transmissionshere.5oE Tele-X & SiriusConfirmation of the number of digital channels on Tele-X; Telenor hastwo Danish channels, two Swedish channels and one Norwegian channel allaround 12322MHz.  Kinnevik has encoded the TV6 signal in D2 Mac.  TV3and ZTV have just scrambled too.10oE: Eutelsat II F2Med TV had an off-day recently when the Smartcrypt from the feedchannel ended up on the main output.  Med TV has claimed that attemptsto disrupt its signal were made recently.  It is not clear if theuplink to this satellite or the feeds between sites were the target.Nor is it clear if there really was a deliberate attempt to jam asatellite transponder, which would be a first in Europe, although therehave been many accidental instances.  London, that unlikely haven ofclandestine TV, has a new potential visitor; Serb TV is the nextstation to try to gain a UK uplink licence, much to the probableembarrassment of the UK Government.  The studios will be in Paris.  Afeed into TV2 Denmark used 11163MHz horizontal.13oE: Eutelsat II F1 & Hot Bird 1Latest arrival, in clear Pal with stereo at 7.02/7.2 and slightly lowlevel audio is Onyx, a long expected fifth German music channel.  Itairs 18 hours a day with a mix of music to appeal to a more matureaudience.  11146MHz is the frequency, trans-ponder 22A.  Auto-noumusTelevisao de Catalunya has appeared again, last seen at 11492MHzvertical, transponder 14.  The audio feed of BBC World Service on NBCSuper Channel 7.38 MHz is now WRN2 with Vatican Radio.  A rather smallmedia player, the sole 12GHz broadcaster on this satellite, AB1 Channelof France, is the beginning of yet another, French digital channelpackage, this is the seventh to be announced.  The transponder maystill be able to preempted by other users, as a feed for Reuters wasnoted.  Polonia 1, which retreated to the upper half of Tp.34 on thissatellite when legal pressure forced it off terrestrial transmitters,is re-launched in the market with more sports and music.  TRT on11818MHz is now accompanied by an FM Turkish radio on 7.02/7.2 MHz.Tp.45, 11542 MHz is earmarked for Italy's Telepiu to compress six TVchannels.16oE: Eutelsat II F3Telepace, the channel from Vatican TV has had some extended programminglately and may be expanding.  This is a good satellite for feeds;11163MHz can be quiet but saw a TF1 feed from the Russian capital.After 1800GMT that channel is used by Thaiwave, the DM56 per monthchannel.  It feeds into BT London from Bangkok via an Intelsat feed.Its future scrambling system is not settled.  The schedule is plannedto be 1800-2300 GMT, starting at 1400 at weekends but has yet tomaterialise.  It is presently Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat & Sun from 1800-2000GMT.  11638MHz is used for feeds sometimes and 12542MHz is activetoo.  Apna TV has not been seen again on this satellite, nor Ku-BandGorizont.19.2oE: Astra 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D & 1EMore MPEG-2 tests are being seen above 11700MHz from Astra 1E and somedigital tests used Astra 1D as well.  Actual broadcasts from ARD andZDF have started being up-linked from Betzdorf to 11836MHz horizontal.Canalsatellite of France has left Astra 1D tests behind and settled onAstra 1E transponders 66, 11739MHz vertical and Tp.70, 11817MHzvertical.  On 11953.5 and 11993MHz, transponders 77 and 80 are beingused by Nethold.  Beacon frequency for the satellite is 11202 verticaland 10948.5MHz horizontal and it is actually at 19.15 degrees East.The channels and video being shown on most of the above frequencieschange frequently, while there is no audience.  Although Astra 1E isgoing to have a slow start, Astra 1F is due to launch next month.Rival Hot Bird 2 does not fly until October.  A new name for Tp.  11FilmNet Plus on Astra, it is now FilmNet 1.  Daytime Tp.  49 110714 MHzhorizontal is filled by 11 hours of Nickelodeon Germany, Arte uses theevening slot.  Arte also shares with La Cinquieme on 13 degrees Eastand five degrees West.  New to Astra 1D is Tp.  61 Home OrderTelevision, German tele-shopping with an uncluttered screen.  Thechannel is due to move to Astra 1E this year.  America One radiolaunched as expected on 11538MHz at 7.74MHz with some sharedprogramming with WRN1 on 7.38MHz.  On Pro 7, Star*Sat Radio and RadioRopa have ceased analogue transmission and gone ADR, where Germanyleads the way.  The ADR versus analogue score is 53 analogue against 40digital, not counting the DMX channels.48oE: DFS1 KopernikusThis satellite has gone walkabout twice in recent months.  The firstamble was in late November, the second in mid-December.  The satelliteformerly known as Kopernikus 1, once a full TV satellite, seems to bepotential space junk.  Using the beacons to track it, it was lasttracked moving East, a long way from the supposed 33.5 degrees Easthome.  The satellite may never now return to anything near operationaluse.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.
