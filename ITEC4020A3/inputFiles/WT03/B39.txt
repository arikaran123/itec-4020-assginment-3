Bergen Brunswig fell $5.125, or 15.6%, to close at$27.625, and Ivax dropped $3.75, or 21%, to close at $12.50, a 52-week low.The deal followed Ivax's disclosure earlier this year that earnings would belower than anticipated and that the company would therefore violate its bankcovenants."It's a terrible deal and Bergen is nuts," said one arbitrageur."If the deal breaks, we think Ivax goes down considerably and Bergen Brunswigwon't move much," the arb added, giving the deal even odds of collapse."There's a lot of shareholder anger out there," he said.Another arb said Bergen Brunswig is sure to annoy a lot of its suppliers andwill have to choose between their products and Ivax's. "Bergen Brunswig isbuying a company that does a lot of business with people they compete with," hesaid.If Bergen Brunswig shareholders vote against a deal with Ivax, it won't be thefirst time Ivax got left at the altar. Shareholders of Halfslund Nycomed ofNorway rejected a stock swap with Ivax late last year.But because insiders at both Ivax and Bergen Brunswig hold large amounts ofshares, any anti-deal sentiment doesn't much matter, a third arb said."If I'm a Bergen shareholder, I'd be very upset about the transaction," the arbsaid. "But I don't think it's a deal killer."The arb explained the Ivax drop as simple mathematics, offering that the .42shares of Bergen Brunswig shares Ivax shareholders would receive for each oftheirs valued the stock at 11.6025, less than its trading level at the time."Maybe that's all Ivax could get," he said.Not everyone was negative on the transaction. Analyst Kevin Silverman of EverenSecurities had good things to say about it. He suggested Ivax would give BergenBrunswig additional profits that would otherwise go to its suppliers."They're buying products from existing manufacturers and earning 15%,"Silverman said. "The manufacturers are making 40%.Combined with Bergen Brunswig's $2 billion in generic drug sales, the additionof generic drugs manufactured at Ivax could add another $600 million to the topline, he said."It makes perfect sense to me."Silverman said Bergen Brunswig stock dropped because the deal brings dilutionof 30 cents per share and 30 cents times 15 equals $4.50.   "That's about whatthe stock dropped on the first day," he said.Another reason for the stock drops, Silverman said, is that such a deal hasnever been done before. "People don't particularly like change and that's whatthey're getting here."Back to Headline List CopyrightMERGERS & RESTRUCTURING via NewsNetNovember 18, 1996Olympic Continues Search for GoldBut Followers of its Situation Suggest Only Fools Would BiteOlympic Financial Ltd. continues to insist publicly that its search for a buyeris moving ahead, but the search for a new CEO, the resignation of a boardmember and the adoption of a poison pill have left observers wondering whetherOlympic will sell.Minneapolis-based Olympic, the nation's largest independent provider ofautomobile financing, is moving full speed ahead with its search for a new CEO.Jeffrey Mack resigned as CEO on Aug. 26, the same day Olympic announced it wasentertaining an offer from an interested party.Bob Ollech, an analyst with Principal Financial Securities, said he justreceived a call from the headhunter employed by Olympic looking for leads forits search. "According to her, they were in the early stages, still lookingaround," Ollech said.Mack was said to have balked at the idea of selling the company, according toOllech, but the board that he chose proved to be more powerful than him anddecided to move ahead with the plan despite his objections. Ollech added thatthe search for a new CEO makes any sale even less likely."It certainly makes you think it's less likely to happen, only from a commonsense standpoint," Ollech said. "If they were to offer the CEO position tosomeone, and in the same breath try to sell the company, they'd have a hardtime selling that job. On the other hand, they need a strong CEO to runday-to-day operations in the event that they can't sell it anymore."Jennifer Wykert, investor relations consultant for Olympic, described Olympic'sdecision to step up its search as a "prudent action" to avoid having to startfrom ground zero if a suitor with the right price fails to materialize.The resignation of board member Rick Zona, which came around Oct. 22, after theinitial buyer declined to make an offer, raised even more eyebrows andconcerns, according to one analyst who asked not to be named.Ollech speculated that there could have been a number of circumstances thatcould have led to Zona's untimely departure. As the first theory goes, FirstBank Systems Inc. may have been looking seriously at buying Olympic, and Zona,who is vice chairman of finance at the regional bank holding company, resignedto avoid any possible conflict of interest. The second possibility was thatZona had a "falling out" with the board about selling.Third, Ollech continued, because Zona was on Olympic's audit committee, perhapsthere was something afoot in terms of the company's financial condition, orcredit quality. Another possibility is that he resigned for personal reasons.In any case, the tumultuous activity has not helped Olympic's already volatilestock, which hit a high of $26.625 in September. At presstime, Olympic's stockwas $15.75, which was a modest recovery from a recent $13.50 low.Last month, Olympic announced that a first round of buyers had decided againstmaking definitive offers for the company. But it said a second group of suitorsthat had been waiting in the wings were stepping in with their proposals,including an outright sale, an equity infusion and a strategic alliance.Then, on Nov. 4, Olympic adopted a poison pill to thwart any attempt at ahostile takeover.Pat McGurn, director of corporate programs with InstitutionalShareholder Services, said this move is not unusual. "Diana Corp. went througha well-publicized shopping of itself and, in the end, decided not to do it atall, and then adopted a poison pill," McGurn said.One arbitrageur saw it more as a move of desperation. "Their stock tanked.They're afraid somebody could come in and buy them on the cheap," the arb said."They may well be talking to people, but if they couldn't find a good buyerwhen their stock was in the low $20s, how can they expect it when the stock isat $15."Meanwhile, an analyst who asked not to be named raised questions aboutOlympic's ability to find a buyer. He said, "Olympic has a $2.20 per share[earnings] estimate for '97. If someone really believed that $2.20 estimate,why would they not be able to get someone? That's 12 or 13 times earnings."A number of other analysts agreed that a sale does not seem to be in Olympic'simmediate future.Robert Evans, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Co., said Olympic is stilltalking to three or four parties regarding the sale of the company, but, "Idon't know if it's at the same pace and sense of urgency as it was. In myopinion, the company is probably not going to be acquired at least in the nextfew weeks."In its latest move, Olympic hedged its position by saying it had reevaluatedits price objective, leaving the door open to a slightly lower bid.Back to Headline List CopyrightMERGERS & RESTRUCTURING via NewsNetNovember 18, 1996Nice-Guy Strategy Improves Zell's OddsThe Gravedancer Drops His Lawsuit and Goes After the VotesSam Zell is still zealously pursuing Chateau Properties, Inc., but now he'susing sugar instead of vinegar to catch his fly.By dropping a lawsuit and his hostile tender offer via his Manufactured HomeCommunities, Inc. (MHC), and tailoring his $387.3 million bid to management'sneeds, he's revealing whose favor he's courting: the holders of operatingpartnership (OP) units.Sources debated whether the tactic would work. At presstime, Chateau announcedits rejection of MHC's bid, but that surely will not stop Zell in his tracks,sources said."If anything, the likelihood of his succeeding has increased to say 75%/25%,"an analyst said.MHC currently is under agreement to merge with ROC Communities in a $TK milliondeal. Chateau would have to reject Zell's offer or pony up a reported $10million to $12 million break-up fee for its merger with ROC."[Chateau Chairman John Boll] may just be posturing to get the decks clean" bybetting shareholders won't approve the ROC merger. Then he would be free topursue the Zell offer.Indeed, the outcome of ROC's and Chateau's proxy votes this week will play alarge role in whether the Chicago investor ultimately will attain his goal.On one side were those who saw Zell losing out if he couldn't accomplish thetask of convincing shareholders to vote down the merger. On the other side werethose who believed shareholders would indeed disapprove the merger, leavingClinton Township, Mich.-based Chateau vulnerable to his advances.The Chateau/ROC merger was universally panned by analysts. "This is a uniquesituation where one plus one equals less than two," said one who declined to benamed. "I can't imagine two-thirds of ROC holders approving the deal," headded, giving a higher probability to an eventual Zell win.The latest MHC strategy consisted of a choice of $26 cash or a convertiblepreferred security "designed to address the needs of Chateau OP Unit holders,"according to a press release. The former bid offered to exchange $26 in cash or1.15 MHC common share per Chateau share. Taxes would have removed about $4.50per share from the cash offer, which is what the OP unit holders would have hadto take, sources said.The initial plan also would have consumed resources that sources said arebetter spent enticing Chateau."The tender offer would have dragged on for months. This was Zell's effort toreach closure, a desire to merge sooner rather than later," said Louis Taylor,an analyst with Prudential Securities.Sources did agree that the new bid was superior and had a better chance ofsuccess, but one said he'd hold off judgment until Englewood, Colo.-based ROCholds its vote.The dialogue surrounding the triangle-formerly a square when Sun Communitiesweighed in with a bid for Chateau-has been decidedly one-sided, saidChristopher Hartung, an analyst with Montgomery Securities."MHC is the only one we've heard from," he said. "They've got a great marketingmachine. Because Chateau and ROC have been limited as to what they can say, wehaven't heard the whole story," Hartung added.Additionally, the MHC line has been that its bid offered a generous multiple inan undervalued industry. But with Chateau's stock price at $24.375 atpresstime, Zell's bid confers on Chateau a premium of only 6%, hardly the 21%of the original offer.That said, now that Chateau turned down Chicago-based MHC's bid, it could faceshareholder charges that it breached its fiduciary duty. "They'll have to askif management is making decisions based on economics or emotions," said Taylor."Are they fighting for the company or for their long term employment?" headded.Officials at the three companies, all of which own and operate mobile homeparks, did not return phone calls *Kate Maletz.Back to Headline List CopyrightMERGERS & RESTRUCTURING via NewsNetNovember 18, 1996Restructuring  Coming For Fitzgeralds Gamin:A prepackaged restructuring seems to be in the offing for beleagueredFitzgeralds Gaming Corp., as both debt and equity are held by fewer than adozen groups, sources said.As the private, Las Vegas-based operator of hotels and casinos, heads intoDecember with an $8 million interest payment looming large, interest coverageis barely one to one, sources said. And while Fitzgeralds CFO FernandoBensuaski said the company "intends" to make the payment, he could make noassurances.He added that the company is in the process of trying to secure financing frominstitutional investors, whom he would not identify. And while Bensuaski flatlydenied a bankruptcy is impending, sources didn't buy it.The culprit, sources said, is the usual one: a combination of too much debt ona company in an out-of-favor, and highly competitive industry.One distressed source saw one of three scenarios likely: the bondholders willgain equity in a new company, the casinos will be sold off piecemeal, or acombination of the two will occur.Fitzgeralds' bonds-$123 million in 13% senior secured notes due 2002-are thinlytraded and last sold for 72 in mid September. The issue was a year old onSaturday.Management owns about 80% of the common stock. The company also has issued $20million in preferred stock and $25 million in mixed tranches including $18million in notes secured on the company's Reno property with interest at primeplus one.The 13%s are owned by "less than half a dozen" holders, with Putnam Investmentspossessing the bulk, a source said. Putnam's analyst Herb Wagner declined tocomment.The concentration of notes in few hands could mean a quick end to Fitzgeralds'suffering. "Maybe they [the holders] could force a restructuring that'sbeneficial to them," said Kevin Pilot, the president of Phoenix Capital. Andwhile Bensuaski insisted no talks about bankruptcy have taken place, the marketwas saying a restructuring was in the offing."As long as they can make payroll, it makes sense for them to make some kind ofdeal," with the bondholders, said Andrew Susser, an analyst with Moody'sInvestors Service, which downgraded the 13%s from B3 to Caa Nov. 7."The question is, can they compete long term?" Susser said. "That's a call thenoteholders have to make."A gaming analyst who requested anonymity said, "Long term, it's a toughcompany. There is a future in this company."Fitzgeralds has made some significant capital expenditures recently, includinghotel rooms in its Tunica, Miss., satellite and new restaurants in its LasVegas and Tunica locations. Sources said the investment could pay off.But in the meantime, the company's "high leverage, low liquidity, weak cashflows, heavy amortization schedule, and competitive pressures in each if itskey markets," remain a problem, according to Moody's.Bensuaski said Fitzgeralds' plans include seeking capital with the help ofSouthcoast Capital Corp., an investment bank it hired in August. It could notbe determined why Oppenheimer & Co. was no longer representing Fitzgerald.The company hasn't released its third quarter numbers yet, but "we don't expectgreat results," said the gaming analyst. He added he expected earnings would beflat compared with last year.Fitzgeralds' troubles hang against a backdrop of an industry saturated withplayers. The entire gaming sector is hurting, sources said, especially inTunica, where the company just completed construction on a 507 room hotel,Fitzgeralds Tunica. Competition in the area is fierce, Susser said, and theaddition of Harrah's Mardi Gras and Grand Casinos earlier this year haveincreased the number of gaming positions by 40%.The Reno, Nev. outpost, Silver Legacy, saw steep room-rate discounting andlower margins due in part to the absence of a major bowling tournament. Bowlingevents, though, should draw people to the area in 1997 and 1998, but room ratescould drop further as more hotels are scheduled to open in the city *KateMaletz.Back to Headline List CopyrightMERGERS & RESTRUCTURING via NewsNetNovember 18, 1996Reconfigured Deal For FoxMeyerMcKesson Corp. renegotiated the terms of its purchase of bankruptFoxMeyer Corp., working out a deal that a source said "won't even coverlawyer's fees."A Delaware court approved the transaction whereby McKesson pays $20 million to$23 million in cash to the bankrupt estate. Then, the first $20 million thatthe company collects in receivables would go to McKesson, and the next $10million in receivables will be split 50%/50% by McKesson and the estate,according to the source who was present at an auction hearing on Nov. 8. Theremainder would go to the estate, and would pay off professional fees.The former deal saw McKesson paying $80 million in cash, which would be held inescrow for about six months, sources said.The source said vendors complained about the new arrangement and that the moneywould be difficult to collect. Robert Peiser, the company's vice chairman andCEO, theorized that with the outstanding receivables amounting to $90 million,and McKesson skimming off the first $25 million, the receivables could reach$70 million to $75 million."I think that's insane," the source said. "It's complex, it's not that easy torecover."The unsecured trade claims dipped back to the 10 to 12 range from the 15 to 20they were at the week before on the news of the reconfigured deal. "Rumors thatanother company would come in [with a better bid] had held up the unsecuredtrade claims," the source said *Kate Maletz.Back to Headline List CopyrightMERGERS & RESTRUCTURING via NewsNetNovember 18, 1996DOj takes new Mergers approachThe Department of Justice's Antitrust Division's broadening of traditionallegal reviews of anticompetitive issues allows for fairer analyses ofhorizontal mergers, the acting head of the division said in a recent speech.Speaking earlier this month before the American Bar Association in Washington,Joel Klein said the DOJ now looks beyond the two traditionally recognizedmethods of antitrust analysis: "per se" and "rule of reason."According to the Supreme Court, per se mergers, which account for a smallminority of cases, are those "because of their pernicious effect on competitionand lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable.Rule of reason analyses require a comprehensive market analyses of pro- andanti-competitive effects."A reasonable mode of antitrust analysis needn't always require full-blownassessments of market effects," Klein said. "Some middle ground between the twotraditional approaches often makes sense."Matters that are too complex for per se condemnation sometimes get shoe hornedinto that category, while some  anticompetitive practices without anydemonstrable virtue escape condemnation because of insufficient evidence tosatisfy the requirements of a full-blown market analysis," he said.Rather than restrict itself to the per se and rule of reason  polaralternatives, the DOJ, Klein said, uses a three-step approach when consideringwhether horizontal mergers would directly limit price or production competitionThe first step, he said, is to decide whether the deal would be a per seviolation, such as an agreement to fix prices, curtail output or dividemarkets. Once the DOJ concludes a horizontal deal is not per se illegal, hecontinued, the agency then asks the parties involved whether there's a"procompetitive justification" for the agreement."We expect a response that doesn't merely speculate about the existence ofefficiencies, but rather comes forward with real world factual and experteconomic evidence to support the claim," he said.If the DOJ finds significant procompetitive benefits to a deal, Klein said, theagency then looks at whether likely anti-competitive effects would outweighthem. "The key point I want to stress," he said, "is that only if there arereal procompetitive benefits should there be any need to show actualanticompetitive effects."Using such analyses, Klein said, should open the door to at least someadditional consideration of procompetitive justifications for horizontalmergers. On the other hand, he added, the approach also ensures that faciallyanticompetitive, but potentially justifiable, agreements are not automaticallygiven green lights simply because they can't be condemned as per se illegal."By requiring proof of procompetitive benefits, we're lessening the burden ofproving a violation compared to what we'd have to show under a full-blown ruleof reason analysis," he said *Richard Rubin.Back to Headline List CopyrightMERGERS & RESTRUCTURING via NewsNetNovember 18, 1996Arbs Miffed at AIM's AbstentionArbs were seething that one Wallace Computer Services, Inc. shareholderabstained from a Nov. 6 vote on whether shareholders have a voice in takeovers.AIM Strategic Income Fund, a closed-end management investment company,abstained, after initially signaling it was in favor of the proposed bylawchange that would require Wallace's board to hold a shareholder vote within 90days after it received a qualified bid in order to keep up a defensive postureagainst the offer.

Dallas-based Redman was Champion's seventhacquisition in two-and-a-half years, she said."It was a tremendous acquisition," said Troy Ussery, an analyst at RauscherPierce Refsnes. "It brought Champion to the position of being one of thelargduct line complements our product line very nicely," Dout said.

"Weare similar in the fact that we focus on mid- to high-end manufacturing inhousing, but in most areas of the country we're at slightly different pricepoints so we complement each otherd financial advisor to Redman. At that time,explained Jeoff Stern, Champion's advisor and a managing director at DonaldsonLufkin & Jenrette, Champion was a much smaller company, Redman was private, andthe two CEOs shared a strong mutual respect.But it wasn't until June 5 of this year that Alexander, on Redman's behalf,approached Young at an industry conference about a possible deal. It would bethe only company Redman would talk to."I approached no one else" but Champion, said Alexander. "It was Sturgess'view-and he had spoken with members of his board-that the commonality of focusin terms of business strategy, and yet the differences in the physicallocations of facilities, made this a combination that was a win-win for bothsides, which doesn't happen often today."Young met with Sturgess and the financial advisors of both companies almost amonth later to pursue the stock transaction. After that, things moved ratherquickly.A rumor of illness at the top of Redman may have contributed to the speed withwhich the deal was done, according to one source who asked not to beideh. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,and its quality and depth of management," U diligence, the group met again todiscuss a range of exchange ratios, the midpoint of which was 1.24 Championshares per Redman share. The ratio and the deal were soon settled upon.A pooling transaction was important to the deal, Dout said. "By merging the twocompanies together, it makes us stronger financially and operationally. Thisway both shareholders win. We always go for a win-win proposition."Although analysts uniformly agreed that Champion paid a higher multiple ofoperating profit for Redman than previous acquisitions-6.4 times EBITDAcompared to an average 3.9 times-they also agreed that Champion got its money'sworth. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,and its quality and depth of management," Ussery said."The big question is: 'What's next?,'" said Ussery. "Champion will clearlybenefit in the upcoming year from the Redman acquisition, but we have severalother major competitors who will run out of steam in 1997 without anacquisition. This is the tip of the iceberg."Ussery added that when using the same evaluation as the Redman acquisition,Belmont Homes, the nation's eleventh largest manufactured home builder, wouldbe around $16 a share; so at its current price of $10.50, it's bound to beraising eyebrows-with Champion or other industry players."With Redman, the immediate need for more acquisitions isn't as great forChampion, but Walt [Young] has never been one to pass up a bargain," Usserysaid Alena Joy Berenblatt.Back to Headline List WT03-B39-2IA059-000325-B026-113http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi72.html 205.156.212.5 19970115011720 text/html 21593HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:15:29 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:20 GMTContent-length: 21404Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi72.html Sample Issue Copyright MORTGAGE MARKETPLACE via NewsNet January 15, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FANNIE LIMIT MOVE TO $207,000 IMMINENT (763 words) SEC ISSUES DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING RULE (812 words) IRS FINALIZES DEBT FORGIVENESS REGULATION (390 words) NOTEBOOK (734 words) FANNIE JOINS RURAL HOUSING SERVICE'S AMERICAN INDIAN PILOT PROGRAM (262 words) CopyrightMORTGAGE MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996FANNIE LIMIT MOVE TO $207,000 IMMINENTFannie Mae is on the verge matching Freddie Mac's $4,150 conformingloan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its limit to$207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage industrysources close to the agency.        Fannie has received numerous requests from its customers to raiseits conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect Jan. 1,sources said. And the agency, which had maintained that would fullyconsider the views of its customers before rendering a decision, may makeits announcement as soon as Jan. 15.        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last twoweeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and thepotential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fullydiscuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders.        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgagecompanies that have traditionally directed most of their business to FannieMae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to takeadvantage of the agency's higher limit.        However, those occurrences may not have qualified as a trend.Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie raisedits limits, and a Freddie spokesperson couldn't confirm whether the companyhad actually seen an increase in commitments, offering that it had noupdated data to support that conclusion.        But in talks with its customers over the last month, Jeffers saidFannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the change in themarketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew that to be a realpossibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to Freddie, "though it'stoo early to see it happening--I wouldn't be surprised."        Freddie Mac decided to raise its limits in December to match a riseis the Federal Housing Finance Board's home price index. Both Fannie andFreddie's loan limits are statutorily tied to the index, but Fannie optednot to raise its limits, thus making the conforming loan limits differentfor each agency for the first time ever.        The debate over raising the limits revolves around the FHFB index,an economic indicator that has declined each of the last two years. Despitedeclines in 1993 and 1994, neither government-sponsored enterprise loweredits loan limit, decisions that garnered criticism from Congress and HUDSecretary Henry Cisneros. But declines in home price index are consideredanomalies, so when the index rose for the first time in three years inNovember, Freddie lifted its limit to match the increase; Fannie kept itslimit at $203,150. Freddie's critics immediately charged that agency hadraised the limit without considering the previous year's decreases.        Freddie's decision also  sparked the ire of some in the thriftindustry who contended that the agency is encroaching on the lower crust ofthe jumbo loan market niche it has carved out. Freddie Mac argues, however,that that is not the case, noting that only 1% of all its 1994 loanpurchases were for the loan limit maximum.        Lawmakers chided Freddie for its decision and praised Fannie formaintaining its limit. Privately, House Banking Committee sourcesacknowledged that the market was likely to force Fannie to raise its limit.        Freddie's decision also affected the Federal HousingAdministration. Although Freddie's loan limits are tied to FHFB's index,FHA's limits are tied to Freddie Mac's conforming loan limit. So whenFreddie upped its limits, it inadvertently raised FHA's. HUD ponderedwhether it had the statutory authority to avoid raising the limits, butafter a week of review it concluded that it too had to make an increase.Minus the statutory authority to force Freddie or FHA to maintain itslimits, one House Banking Committee staffer expected the issue to be takenup by Congress early in 1996.        The differing loan limits has caused problems for lenders, thebiggest of which are the costs associated with having to split theirportfolios between Fannie and Freddie, said Vicki Vidal, director ofgovernment agency relations for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "Anythingabove the Fannie limit must be segregated from Freddie pools and that takesmanpower and diligence," she said. "In some cases a (computerized) systemcan tell you, but some for some lenders the actual physical shipping andhandling has to be done."        Some Fannie-exclusive lenders also faced the additional costs ofswitching to Freddie Mac's system. One mortgage industry lobbyist said thatwith mortgage origination margins thin anyway, some lenders weren't lookfondly upon switching, primarily because of the costs associated and thetime it would take to retrain their staffs.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORTGAGE MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SEC ISSUES DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING RULEThe Securities and Exchange Commission said its proposedregulations on derivatives disclosure are aimed at closing three kinds ofproblems it found during an extensive review of company reports, but theinitial reaction of some thrift lenders is that the rule may be redundant.        The SEC proposed amending its regulations to clarify and expand itsexisting requirements for financial statement footnote disclosures aboutregistrants' accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.Specifically, the proposed rule changes would affect SEC Regulations S-X,S-K and various forms including Form 20-F. The proposed amendments werepublished in the Jan. 8 Federal Register; comments are due to the SEC byMay 7.        "This rule appears to be much farther reaching than one wouldinitially conclude," said Marti Sworobuk, accounting manager for America'sCommunity Bankers. ACB's accounting committee hasn't reviewed the proposedregulation yet, but Sworobuk offered that "it doesn't appear to be so muchas a derivative disclosure as it is a document intended to requirefinancial institutions to disclose how they manage interest rate risk," shesaid.        Under the proposed rule, she said, SEC-regulated institutions wouldbe required to disclose of whatever they are doing to manage risk, such ashedging risk by using loan portfolios or by matching the terms of theirfunding sources. "It doesn't just involve derivative instruments," shesaid.        Sworobuk said ACB may be interested in how much additional burdenthe rule would put on thrifts--if any. "The SEC should recognize that somefinancial institutions are already submitting the same kind of informationto banking regulators," she said, speaking of the ConsolidatedMaturity/Rate Schedule, or CMR, that thrifts are already required to submitto the Office of Thrift Supervision. Other banking regulators are expectedto implement similar disclosures later this year, Sworobuk added, possiblyas soon as June.        "These disclosures provided to the agencies under FIDICIA 305 wouldmeet the requirements initiated by the SEC," she said.        The SEC amendments would only affect publicly traded institutions,but it is also likely to have an effect on the business strategies ofacquisition-minded commercial banks, mortgage banks and thrifts. Mergeractivity among banks has been strong over the last year, and SEC-regulatedlenders may have to more closely consider the derivative accountingpractices of any institution they've targeted for acquisition.        "The proposed amendments were developed after extensive review bythe SEC staff of disclosures made by approximately 500 registrants andconsideration of the findings of studies published by various public andprivate sector organizations," said SEC Chief Accountant Michael H. Sutton."The commission is hopeful that the proposed disclosures are responsive toconcerns of investors and will head to more useful disclosures aboutderivatives and other related instruments."        The SEC wants to improve what it considers inadequate disclosuresabout companies' accounting policies. Its proposal would require "enhanceddescriptions in the footnotes to the financial statements of accountingpolicies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodityinstruments," the agency said.        The agency is also looking to improve companies' disclosures ofmarket risk, which the SEC said applies to financial instruments other thanderivatives. Here the agency said it wants to see both quantitative andqualitative disclosures. For quantitative disclosures, the agency isproposing three alternatives from which firms would be free to choose.These are:         Tables showing expected cash flows and related contract termscategorized by expected maturity dates.         Sensitivity analysis showing the possible loss in earnings, fairvalues or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from certainhypothetical changes in rates or prices.         Value at risk disclosures showing the  potential loss in earnings,fair values or cash flows of market risk over a selected period of timefrom events with selected probabilities of occurrence.        The qualitative disclosures about market risk would cover how acompany manages its exposures with "a description of the objectives,general strategies and instruments, if any, used to manage thoseexposures." The third kind of problem the SEC wants to correct occurs when firms donot provide information about derivatives tied to other activities that aredisclosed.        "For example, when the information is required to be disclosed inthe footnotes to the financial statements about interest rates andrepricing characteristics of debt obligations, registrants should include,when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives," the SEC said.        "Similarly, summary information and disclosures in Management'sDiscussion and Analysis ("MD&A") about the cost of debt obligations shouldinclude, when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives."        In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,the SEC said it would look at ways provide a safe harbor where appropriatein the derivatives disclosures. These particular proposals would generallynot apply to mutual funds or small business issuers, although some of thedisclosures could be required under separate regulations.        The SEC said it will take comment on the proposals until May andexpects to revisit the rules after five years.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORTGAGE MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996IRS FINALIZES DEBT FORGIVENESS REGULATIONThe Internal Revenue Service's final rule on reporting of dischargeof indebtedness is much more acceptable to the lending industry than theproposed regulation, which ran into a firestorm when published for commentin 1993.        America's Community Bankers reacted to the new rule by saying it"substantially mitigated" the compliance burden on the lending industryimposed by the temporary rule. For example, said James O'Connor, tax lawyerfor the ACB, the "indebtedness" on which reporting is required to limitedto stated principal and does not include interest and penalties.        Rick Steinegar, chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association's taxsubcommittee and director of taxes for GE Capital Mortgage Corp. said therules "are an improvement over the proposed rule." For example, it givesentities covered by the regulation until Dec. 26 to gear up to comply.Moreover, it gives specific instances where disclosure is triggered, unlikethe proposed rule, which provided a less-specific "facts and circumstances"criteria that would have made it more difficult for institutions todetermine if compliance was required.        Steinegar also noted that the final rule will only apply to"applicable financial entities," such as direct or indirect units of bankor thrift holding companies and government-sponsored enterprises. That doesnot cover independent mortgage bankers, he said.        Independent mortgage bankers would be required to comply only whenthey acted as a servicer for a government-sponsored enterprise, such asGNMA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the VA.        "It is much more specific and easy to comply with," he said.        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, requirefinancial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C informationreturns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders becausethey say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven inexcess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.        But lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigatingthe need to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRSfor several years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need toforgive debt.        The final rules are effective for discharges of indebtednessoccurring after Dec. 21, 1996. No penalties will be imposed by the IRS forfailures to file until then, O'Connor said.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORTGAGE MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996NOTEBOOKHUD Finalizes RegFor HECM Endorsements        HUD-approved lenders participating in the Home Equity ConversionMortgage program will now find processing these loans without approval fromthe department easier.        HUD published its final rule Dec. 21 authorizing its approvedlenders to process HECM, or "reverse mortgage," loans under its directendorsement program. Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17,but the final rule, which appears in the Dec. 21 Federal Register, makesthe change official; it also completes one of many streamlining proceduresHUD has initiated over the last several months.        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECMthat lenders have not issued a conditional commitment is eligible fordirect endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insuredbefore Sept. 15, 1995 must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUDoffice for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance.        If HUD deems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, itwill give the lender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DEprogram. oFreddie Revises RulesFor Balloons and Resets        Freddie Mac seller/servicers will need to contact reset and balloonmortgage borrowers about 50 days earlier than they're used to, according torevisions that Freddie Mac has made to its seller/servicer guide.Under the revised guidelines, which were announced in Bulletin 95-13,lenders must now notify borrowers between 100 and 110 days before theloan's maturity date, if not required sooner by law. Under Freddie'sprevious guidelines, lenders were required to contact borrowers at least 60days before the balloon maturity date. Additionally, Freddie said it hasadded information that servicers must include in the notification, and hasalso provided more guidance to lenders in working with borrowers who do notmeet reset conditions and can't pay off their balloon/reset mortgages.Freddie said the new requirement would take effect June 1. oHUD Reaches AccordsWith Nine FHA Lenders        Nine FHA-approved lenders reached settlement agreements with HUDfor a variety of irregular actions involving Federal Housing Administrationprograms, the department announced Dec. 12.        The department's Mortgagee Review Board, which investigated thelenders based on suggestions from HUD field offices, cited The Money Store,Sacramento, Calif., for violations of HUD-FHA Title I property improvementloan requirements. Specifically, the board said TMS failed to properlyservice Title I loans, did not submit timely FHA insurance claims andfailed to report timely the sale of Title I notes and transfers ofinsurance reserves. As a settlement agreement, TMS agreed to pay HUD$35,000, cancel insurance on several loans and submit to future reviews bythe department.        Among the other eight lenders HUD reached settlements with inDecember was the New England National Mortgage Corporation, Andover, Mass.,which was cited for permitting non-exclusive employees to originate FHAloans, and First American Mortgage Co., Sulphur Springs, Texas, which wascited for permitting borrowers to hand-carry verifications of employmentand failing to perform face-to-face interviews. New England National agreedto pay an undisclosed civil money penalty and First American agreed toindemnify HUD for claim losses. Both also agreed to implement correctiveactions.        Other settlement agreements included: Western Fidelity MortgageCo., Salt Lake City; Pacific Inland Mortgage Corp., Anaheim Hills, Calif.;Interbank Funding Group, San Diego; Mortgage America Nationwide, GrandTerrace, Calif.; Unifed Mortgage Corp., San Diego; and Z and Z FundingGroup, San Diego. As part of the settlement, the lenders do not admit toany fault or liability. oFed Offers VideoOn Home Buying Process        The Federal Reserve Board is offering an educational video forconsumers it hopes will enlighten prospective home buyers on the nuances ofobtaining a mortgage.        The video, entitled "Both Borrower and Lender," is designed forfirst-time home buyers and is divided into four segments: Financialpreparedness; types and terms of mortgages; the mortgage applicationprocess; and settlement and closing. The entire program is roughly twohours long with each segment runs about 30 minutes.

Starting in January, Fannie will begintaking part in the Rural Housing Service's Rural Housing Native Americanpilot, but will limit its initial participation to 10 tribes.        The eligible tribes include: Gila River, Arizona; Navajo Nation,Arizona; San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico; Pala Band of All Mission, California;Salish-Kootenai, Montana; Chippewa-Cree, Montana; Seminole Nation, Florida;Cheyenne River Sioux, South Dakota; Lac Courte Oreilles, Wisconsin; andOmaha, Nebraska.        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they havea good working relationship with RHS and the Bureau of Indian Affairs,although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be added later in thepilot.        RHS has also determined that these tribes have a judicial systemthat supports mortgage lending and are receptive to using debt refinancingfor new and existing homes. They are likely to approve the required legaldocuments without extensive changes, and have at least 10 tribal memberswho have sufficient income and credit histories to qualify for a mortgage,Fannie said.        In a related issue, Fannie (Announcement 95-21) has clarified thatit does not place a limitation on the number of Section 184 Indian HousingAuthority mortgages it will buy. In Announcement 95-06, the company saidthose loans would be considered as being secured investment properties.This prompted questions, the agency said, about whether a borrowerfinancing a number of properties is eligible.Back to Headline List WT03-B39-3IA059-000325-B026-153http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi81.html 205.156.212.5 19970115011823 text/html 50491HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:16:28 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:23 GMTContent-length: 50302Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi81.html Sample Issue Copyright NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY REPORTER via NewsNet July 29, 1993 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES ALABAMA FILINGS (116 words) ARIZONA FILINGS (397 words) CALIFORNIA FILINGS (186 words) DELAWARE FILINGS (202 words) FLORIDA FILINGS (289 words) GEORGIA FILINGS (213 words) ILLINOIS FILINGS (161 words) LOUISIANA FILINGS (42 words) MARYLAND FILINGS (187 words) MASSACHUSETTS FILINGS (189 words) MICHIGAN FILINGS (152 words) MINNESOTA FILINGS (39 words) MISSOURI FILINGS (44 words) MONTANA FILINGS (33 words) NEW JERSEY FILINGS (77 words) NEW YORK FILINGS (407 words) NORTH CAROLINA FILINGS (41 words) NORTH DAKOTA FILINGS (43 words) OHIO FILINGS (68 words) OREGON FILINGS (61 words) PENNSYLVANIA FILINGS (303 words) PUERTO RICO FILINGS (65 words) SOUTH CAROLINA FILINGS (85 words) SOUTH DAKOTA FILINGS (36 words) TENNESSEE FILINGS (30 words) TEXAS FILINGS (192 words) VIRGINIA FILINGS (171 words) CopyrightNATIONAL BANKRUPTCY REPORTER via NewsNetJuly 29, 1993ALABAMA FILINGSALABAMA                    KEENUM, INC.7/7/93                     Manufacture of poultry vaccines, Anniston, ALND AL                      ASSETS: Undetermined at current dateNo. 93-4156                LIABILITIES: Undetermined at current date                           PRINCIPAL: Robert Keenum                           CONTACT: Harry P.

"If they can get $90 million, I think they'd takeit."The broker said that DLJ likely will take a loss on the company.  "DLJ boughtthe company at the top of the market," he said.  "Ultimately, this isn't goingto look good."One source said, "this deal is going to hurt them (DLJ)," he said.  "I thinkthe merchant banking unit has a lot to explain to its investors."First Franklin is the result of a merger between itself and Franklin MortgageCorp., Irvine, CA.  In 1994 Franklin also bought the Jacksonville, FL,servicing operation of Ryland Mortgage Co., Columbia, MD.In early December it was revealed that DLJ was exiting the warehouse/gestationrepo business, a line of products it had a strong presence in.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Low-Mod Mortgage is Freddie's LargestFar Rockaway, NY-The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has purchased itslargest mortgage loan ever, a $44.43 million multifamily mortgage secured byWavecrest Gardens, a 1,657-unit complex here.Larson Financial Resources, a Program Plus lender based in Somerset, NJ, wasthe originator of this mortgage, which was made to Goldfarb Properties, theowner of the complex.The mortgage is a 20-year fixed-rate loan with a gross spread of 175 basispoints over Treasuries, with a loan-to-value ratio of 75% and a debt servicecoverage ratio of 1.38.Freddie Mac's previous largest loan purchase was for $30 million in theChicago area.  Its average loan size for multifamily is $5 million.  Ittraditionally has made loans on smaller properties.Wavecrest Gardens is affordable to households with income of $34,000 or less,which is 80% of the local median income.  The complex has no subsidizedapartments.Thus this loan helps Freddie Mac meet its affordable housing mandates asestablished by Congress for both low and moderate income families and forcentral cities.  Far Rockaway is part of New York City.Leland Brendsel, chairman and chief executive of Freddie Mac, said thistransaction "shows our strong commitment to multifamily lending."The company has found that contributing to the deterioration of multifamilyhousing are situations where owners are under economic distress.It is important to create an economic situation where the owner can maintainthe building, Mr.  Brendsel said.Freddie Mac is looking to work with high quality lenders like Larson and highquality owners like Goldfarb that are committed to maintain the propertiesthey own, he addedThomas J.  Watt, senior vice president, multifamily housing, added that thedeal is "tangible evidence of Freddie Mac's ongoing commitment to New YorkCity."He likened Wavecrest Gardens to a community, with medical offices in a numberof buildings, an adjacent shopping center and even housing the local office ofRep.  Floyd Flake, D., NY.Rep.  Flake, whose tenancy mirrors the nearly 10 years that Goldfarb hascontrolled Wavecrest Gardens, said the owner's "commitment far exceeds whatthey've put in in dollars."Since acquiring the complex, Goldfarb has done massive renovations to 70% ofthe apartments.  The new loan will allow the owners to continue renovationsand make other improvements."Freddie Mac's financing of such a sizable, multifamily apartment complexdemonstrates its commitment to the stability of New York City's rental housingmarket and to urban communities that have a vested interest in affordablehousing," Mr.  Flake said.As of the end of November, Freddie Mac had purchased $180 million ofmultifamily mortgages in the New York City area.Mr.  Brendsel said the company expects to purchase $2 billion in multifamilyloans during 1995.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996FASB Report Details Derivatives DisclosuresNorwalk, CT-Federal Accounting Standards Board disclosure of derivativesholdings by several businesses - including several mortgage industry players -are available in a recent 100-page report by the agency for $11 a copy.Among the institutions studied are:  Astoria Federal Savings, Bank of America,Chase Manhattan and Chemical banks, Citicorp, Crestar Financial, FirstChicago, Hibernia Savings Bank, Huntington Bancshares, J.P.

Analysts believethese buybacks will take place in 1997."With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably abovethe statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand ourcommitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive JamesJohnson said.Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal HomeLoan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion."The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae amore diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have morethan one funding source," he added.FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,also gave its stamp of approval."Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company'scompliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that iswithdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirementsfor core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Maccurrently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stocksplit.Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in thefour-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individualinvestors."Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target priceon Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases."With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock shouldperform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996FNMA, NBA Teams Join Up for RehabsBoston-The Federal National Mortgage Association has formed partnerships with10 National Basketball Association teams to rehabilitate housing in thesurrounding neighborhoods of the various teams.Rehabilitation has begun on the second of five properties in Boston where FNMAteamed up with the Boston Celtics and the city government to providerenovation funds.The rehabilitation will be financed with a grant of $125,000 from the FannieMae Foundation, an undisclosed sum from the Boston Celtics and $100,000 fromthe city of Boston.The project is managed by Nuestra Comunidad, a nonprofit organization thatprovides housing for low- and moderate-income families.Employees of Fannie Mae and the Celtics will work together on the rehab.Fannie Mae recently formed its partnership with the Atlanta Hawks.  It willinvolve Hawks players and staff and Fannie Mae employees in consumer educationefforts to promote homeownership.The Hawks Home Team along with Fannie Mae staff will participate in therehabilitation of two homes for low-income families in Atlanta's Martin LutherKing Jr.  historic district.The project is managed by the Historic District Development Corp.  and fundedwith a $75,000 grant from the Foundation.As part of the Hawks partnership, Fannie Mae will become a broadcast sponsorof the Hawks' games, airing advertisements that offer viewers free informationon becoming a homeowner.Fannie Mae's partnership with the Houston Rockets will sponsor theconstruction of two homes in Houston's Fifth Ward neighborhood.The construction will be managed by the Fifth Ward Community RedevelopmentCorp., a local nonprofit.The Foundation provided a grant of $75,000.Fannie Mae also became a broadcast sponsor for the Rockets' games.In addition to the Celtics, Hawks, and Rockets, Fannie Mae has formedpartnerships with NBA teams in Seattle; Oakland, CA; Cleveland; San Antonio;Milwaukee; Charlotte, NC:  Portland, OR; and Washington, DC.By the end of the 1994-95 season, Fannie Mae's Home Team partnerships with NBAteams have built or rehabilitated 29 homes in inner-city communities and theFoundation has made more than $900,000 in grants to local nonprofitorganization to support the effort.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996GSE Stocks Seen Staying High in '96New York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal NationalMortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been tradingnear or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for bothstocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The questionis whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies tonumerous factors."Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could bebecause a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end ofthe year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble whilethe financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both representconservative financials - a good place to be.Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are verygood, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondarymarket.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been verypositive, and this attracts investors."Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that thestocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doingreasonably well in recent weeks.But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlookfor Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Asset Disposition RoundupWashington-The Federal National Mortgage Association is consolidating all ofits property management and disposition functions to the Southwestern RegionalOffice in Dallas.The change will allow the secondary mortgage market company to dispose ofacquired properties "more quickly and efficiently," said Robert Engelstad,senior vice president for mortgage and lender standards.It also will enable the agency to offer lenders a full range of services "thatwere previously available only in areas where we had large concentrations ofproperties," Mr.  Engelstad said in a recent lender-letter.However, Fannie Mae has elected to keep the post-foreclosure underwriting andservicing review functions performed by each regional office in those offices."To assure a more consistent application of our underwriting and servicingpolicies, we feel it is more appropriate to assign the responsibility ...  tothe servicer's leader regional office, particularly since that office is theone that is already performing post-purchase underwriting reviews andmonitoring a servicer's delinquent loan servicing performance," the letterexplained.The Dallas office will assume responsibility for managing and disposing ofproperties acquired in the Midwestern region on or after Feb.  1.Effective dates for further consolidation have not yet been set, but FannieMae has targeted the Southeastern region for the first quarter of 1996, theNortheastern region for the third quarter, and the Western region for early in1997.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Smith Barney & Others Named in EA SuitWashington-The government is suing Smith Barney Inc.  and an affiliate fornegligence in the sale of WESTSAV Mortgage Corp., Phoenix, a $2.2 billionservicer that was sold by the Resolution Trust Corp.  in 1991.Several other defendants were named in the case, including the winning bidderfor WESTSAV, Robert W.  Stallings, who renamed the company Express AmericaMortgage Corp., and transformed it into an aggressive wholesaler with $6.5billion in servicing.In September 1994, Mr.  Stallings sold Express America's servicing toNationsBanc, Charlotte, NC.  Express America no longer is in the mortgagebusiness.The RTC charges that Mr.  Stallings and Robert H.  Brown, senior vicepresident of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., Dallas, engaged in "bidmanipulation" that allowed Mr.  Stallings to buy WESTSAV at a significantdiscount.Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, the broker of record on the sale, was an affiliate ofSmith Barney, a relationship that was not known to the RTC, the lawsuit says.Smith Barney served as the government's adviser on most of its mortgagebanking sales.The government charges that the defendants' conduct, "resulted in the RTCreceiving many millions of dollars less for WESTSAV than it would havereceived in an arms-length bidding process."The agency believes it could have made at least $15 million more on the dealif Smith Barney and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes had acted properly.The RTC sold WESTSAV through a stock deal to First Western Partners Inc., Mr.Stallings' company, in May 1991.  The net purchase price was about $26million, according to the lawsuit.Before buying WESTSAV, Mr.  Stallings worked for two S&Ls that later failed.He served as chief executive of WESTSAV's parent Western Savings and Loan,Dallas, before resigning in February 1990 to bid on WESTSAV.In October 1990 four firms made final bids for WESTSAV:  First Financial Groupwhich bid $27.3 million (net to the RTC); First Western $31.8 million (net);Maximilian $40 million (net); and Standard Federal/AMSI, $29 million (net).The lawsuit did not specify their locations.The RTC says First Western had no real financing lined up to buy WESTSAV butthe deal got pushed through by Mr.  Brown who was a long-time friend of Mr.Stallings.One Rauscher official, Tom Lykos, questioned First Western's financing but wastold by Mr.  Brown "not to worry about it," the lawsuit says.The agency says Mr.  Brown gave "inside information" to Mr.  Stallings on thepending sale.The RTC also charges that Rauscher evaluated the bids incorrectly whichbenefited First Western and Stallings."While RPR (Rauscher) reduced the First Western bid by the amount of WESTSAV'sliabilities, RPR also reduced the competing bids by the WESTSAV liabilitieswhich was wrong because the competing bids were submitted on a net basis," theRTC charges.The RTC investigated the case for at least two years.  The law firm bringingthe case on behalf of the government is Morris & Hecker, the same firm thatwon large settlements in the government's case against Charles Keating andprofessional defendants including several prominent law and accounting firms.Mr.  Stallings could not be reached for comment.  Smith Barney also could notbe reached for comment.Rauscher and Mr.  Brown released a statement saying the lawsuit is "withoutmerit."The statement adds that, "based on our own investigation into the matter wehave no reason to believe that any RPR employee did anything illegal orunethical in the course of the WESTSAV transaction."Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Editorial:  Credit Where It's DueThe fact that a governor of the Federal Reserve Board got turned down for acredit card is almost laughable.  And the fact that it was Lawrence B.Lindsey, the central banker most involved with consumer credit, who has beenwarning of the dangers inherent in bankers and other lenders turning theirdecision-making responsibilities over to automated systems, makes it even moreironic.According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, Mr.  Lindsey applied for aToys 'R' Us card through Bank of New York, Delaware, which uses a strictcredit-scoring system.  The Federal Reserve official had refinanced amortgage; extended a line of credit and had several "routine reviews" of hiscredit files over the past year.So in spite of the fact that Mr.  Lindsey has a perfect payment record andadequate income for the credit card account he wanted to open, the number oflenders just looking at his background disqualified him under BofNY's creditscoring.And it seems, at the Delaware-based credit-card operation, while a human beingreviews all approvals, no one looks at the rejections based solely on score.Of course as soon as the bank learned that it had rejected an application froma VIP, it offered to issue a card with the full amount of credit Mr.  Lindseyhad been seeking.The point is that no consumer who pays all of his bills on time should bedenied appropriate credit based on some arbitrary, non-thinking system.We know of mortgage lenders where senior management reviews every rejectedloan application.  At these companies the question is can the application berescued and a means found of providing a mortgage.Unfortunately the trend is in the other direction, toward arbitrary systems.We don't think there's anything inherently wrong with credit scoring.  Butwhere it is allowed to make final judgments without any human, subjectiveoversight it can get out of hand, as the incident with Fed Governor Lindseydemonstrates.Wisconsin had variable-rate mortgages before almost any other state.  Thestate's former Sen.  William Proxmire, who was to become chairman of theSenate Banking Committee, as a young man saw a family member foreclosedbecause of the over-rapid increase in payments on a VRM.That incident probably delayed the implementation of adjustable-rate lendingby Federal financial institutions by eight to 10 years.New technology must be programmed to serve people.  If we become subservientto the technology we will have lost a lot more than we possibly can gain fromthe workload it assumes.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Land Investor Turns from Selling to Developing PropertiesWashington-When Eastern Realty won the bidding for a $99 million landportfolio from the Resolution Trust Corp.  in late 1993, the exit strategycalled for selling off most the portfolio over time.But times have changed and "now we find ourselves developing the largerproperties," ER president Jay Rollins said.Eastern Realty, McLean, VA, and its capital partner are developing fourresidential tracks it acquired in the land offering known as MACO III, namedafter RTC's Mid-Atlantic Consolidated Office.MACO III is an equity partnership and Eastern Realty is the general partner incharge of managing, developing and liquidating the assets for RTC.At a development site near Frederick, MD, Eastern Realty has delivered 12finished lots to production builders and it is under contract to deliveranother 65 lots.  When completed, the MACO III land asset will have 300 homesites.Prior to starting ER, Mr.  Rollins was director of finance for NVR, a largehomebuilder based in McLean.  And his long-term goal is to expand ER's landbusiness with builders."Our business focus in the future will be equity joint ventures withresidential builders and developers," Mr.  Rollins said in an interview.But right now, Eastern is concentrating on managing and working $400 millionin land and commercial assets it has acquired over the past 30 months with itscapital partners.The partnerships have purchased raw and finished land, including residentialand commercial land, from New Jersey to Tennessee.When Eastern Realty opened its doors in early 1993, land assets were plentifuland capital was scarce.  "Return expectations on pure equity capital were inthe 40% range," Mr.  Rollins.But the market for land has shifted dramatically, he said, after capital beganchasing the available product."Return expectations still are in the low 20's but it is very common toleverage those returns with a debt component," he said.With these changing market conditions, Mr.  Rollins has changed his approach.In its most recent deal, Eastern Realty and a capital partner acquired a $31million pool of hotel, office and land assets from First Fidelity Bancorp.,Newark, NJ."We expanded our reach beyond land assets and purchased subperforming hotelloans and a commercial office condominium project," Mr.  Rollins said.He also pointed out that banks are starting to sell smaller pools of assets."We think the large portfolio sales are winding down," he said.  "We arelooking to buy single asset notes, primarily land, and smaller pools ofassets," Mr.  Rollins said.As part of its operations, Eastern Realty also services land and constructionloans for banks and other investors.  The company currently services $40million in land and construction loans.

Parrish, national president of CFMA, said, "this is terrific news."Lenders' confidence in the construction industry - evidenced by theirgranting easier access to credit and larger credit lines - should mean highervolume and revenue in 1996."The survey polled 5,000 companies with annual revenues greater than $1million.  But despite their easier access to credit, respondents were not asoptimistic about future contract revenue as they were last year.

Paul Sarbanes, D., MD, said.  "It desires to be retained."Sales of the tax credits to corporations and individuals raises equity tofinance the construction of affordable housing.At the press conference, the Enterprise Foundation, Columbia, MD, and theLocal Initiatives Support Corp.  here announced that they plan to raise $4.5billion in equity from selling tax credits and develop more than 100,000affordable housing units over the next seven years if the credit is preserved."To sunset the most effective tool ever found to attract private capital tothe housing needs of working families is contrary not only to good policy, butto common sense," said LISC president Paul Grogan.While cutting the LIHTC program is a budget game, the program has its criticsbecause the sales of the tax credits involve syndication fees and it isestimated investors expect a 15% return on their investments along with thetax advantages.Syndicating limited partnerships to individuals is technically complex andexpensive and the U.S.  General Accounting Office estimated several years agothat syndication costs consume 27% of the equity raised.In addition, the Internal Revenue Service and state housing agencies aresupposed to monitor compliance with the LIHTC requirements, but IRS is not setup to administer a housing program.The LIHTC program has become threatened many times before and it is an easytarget for congressional budget cutters.However, advocates of affordable housing are aware that Congress is reducingthe Federal government's role in providing low-income housing and LIHTCprogram is one of the last and most popular housing programs left."Subjecting, the credit to a year-by-year review creates a disincentive forinvestors and developers, and could ultimately destroy what has become one ofthe most effective programs for producing low-income housing in America," saidEnterprise Foundation chairman and chief executive Barton Harvey, IL.Even critics agreed that year-by-year extensions of the tax credit is theworse way to administer the program.It increases the risks to developers and drives up the risk premium investorsdemand when they purchase the credits, a budget analyst said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Letter to the EditorTo the Editor:I was misunderstood and sequentially misquoted in a front page article in theNov.  20th issue of National Mortgage News.  Reporter Brad Finkelstein quotedme as saying:  "More and more companies are turning away from brokers.  Thereis a cumulative amount of evidence that loans from brokers are not as highquality and (the wholesalers) are taking action.  There is a lesson in thisfor mortgage brokers."I hadn't seen or read the article before I stood accused of being "too closeto the banks" and unfair to brokers.Brokers need to know that the reporter got part or my remarks to him right,part wrong.  I clearly said some of those things, but there were threeseparate ideas in separate contexts.By linking two ideas, the flight from wholesale and a lesson, with a third,loan quality, in a single paragraph, the reporter mistakenly attributed to mesomething Jim Johnson said.  I don't think brokers originate inferior qualityproduct.  To the contrary.  Let me explain.When the reporter called recently and asked what I knew about PNC, I said twothings:  1) there was a change in management and 2) the company closed itstable funded broker operation.  A contact at the company had days earlierconfirmed these developments upon my inquiry.I told the reporter that PNC is the forty-second "name" to exit wholesale thepast 18 months.  (Wholesale Access keeps the scorecard via The WholesaleDirectory, so we know.)We talked about Jim Johnson's remarks in San Diego.  I raised the subject,having read an article about the conference in September's Origination News.I said I thought Johnson probably had it wrong.What I believed was that brokers don't determine quality - wholesalers do,they underwrite.  What I heard was that the data Fannie Mae have probably onlyshows the recent economic misfortune of the country's two largest markets,California and New York/New Jersey.Property values, home prices and activity are soft in these areas right now.Unfortunately, both are markets where brokers are the pre-eminent originators.They get well over 50% of total originations in these markets.  So, guesswhat, a downturn occurs and a correlation between brokers and higherdelinquency surfaces.  Hardly a surprise.Frankly, I believe that Johnson linked the two developments together beforeMBA audiences in order to justify adopting tiered pricing based on type oforiginator.NAMB needs to deal head-on with the TPO issue Fannie Mae's chairman raises.Otherwise, it will miss an important opportunity to set the record straight.This was the lesson - not broker quality, or the disappearance of a myriad ofnames from wholesaler ranks.Tom LaMalfa President TSL Consulting Co., Shaker Heights, OHBack to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996EDS:  AU Removes Bar to Direct GSE LendingArlington, VA-Nothing currently prevents the secondary market agencies fromlending direct to the consumer, says Larry Walker of EDS.Speaking at a conference here, he said, that is why "the term 'rip our faceoff' comes to mind," when the industry assesses the significance of theagencies' recent automation efforts, including automated underwriting.Despite the fact that the agencies say their charters don't allow them to lenddirect to the consumer, Mr.  Walker said, neither agency's charter expresslyprohibits consumer lending."Their charter doesn't provide for them to act as technology vendor either,"he added, echoing a point which others have made to National Mortgage News."Fannie and Freddie between them account for more than half of the technologydollars spent so far this year in the U.S.," Mr.  Walker said in a follow-upinterview, referring to the Federal National Mortgage Association and theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.He had given an address entitled, "The effect of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac'stechnology on the marketplace," at an electronic mortgage lending conferencerun by AIC.In a subsequent discussion, Mr.  Walker said, "of course Congress couldprevent it, but - while the agency charters don't provide for direct lending -there is nothing there to stop it."As to why the agency charters are widely perceived as direct lendingobstacles, it is possible that many may not have looked at the actualdocuments, he said.The Mortgage Bankers Association shares his interpretation of the agencycharters, Mr.  Walker said.Despite painting an ominous scenario, Mr.  Walker said of the agencies, "atthis point we probably should believe them."But, since, he continued, "the agencies have all the keys" he counseledlenders to position themselves so as to be less dependent on the agencies.Besides the specter of the government-sponsored agencies replacing lenders,Mr.  Walker - who directs the real estate and mortgage industry group EDS, aPlano, TX, technology vendor - said in his address, "there is a fear the GSEswill replace software vendors."He was particularly critical of Fannie Mae which he said "has gone further"than Freddie Mac.Fannie Mae had less financial need to get into technology sales and hasoffered technologies which extend beyond its legitimate need for upholdingcredit quality (something for which automated underwriting is used), he said.Additionally, Fannie's network is less open to censorship than Freddie's, hesaid.He also questioned recent advertising campaigns in consumer publications byFannie Mae."If they're not going direct to the consumer, why are they running ads inLadies Home Journal?," he asked the audience.Also regarding motivation to enter the technology arena, he said Freddie Macwas somewhat forced to change its function.  That's because the agency wasformed to serve thrifts but the thrift crisis eliminated much of its customerbase."So, the only ones we could give credence to would be Freddie Mac," Mr.Walker continued.Noting that Fannie Mae goes beyond offering automated underwriting, to DesktopOriginator, an origination system for brokers, and to Desktop Trader, he said,"Fannie Mae seems to be going down the path of software writer again."He was referring to Fannie's purchase, in the 1980s, of Servantis SystemsInc., a Norcross, GA, firm which it subsequently sold.Servantis, which lately goes under the name of SSI, provides origination andservicing software.  (Fannie used to market the origination product asMORTRACKS, Mr.  Walker noted.)Last August, a Fannie Mae representative publicly said "we're a technologyvendor.".Regarding the agency networks, Mr.  Walker contrasted Fannie's silence withFreddie's announcement that it does not monitor traffic through its network.Unlike Fannie's Mornet, Freddie's Goldworks is run by a third party (AdvantisInc.  of Schaumburg, IL).Although both agencies have likened their electronic network to a mall, inwhich they are but one store, Mr.  Walker argues the analogy doesn't hold wellfor Fannie."The difference is that Fannie owns the mall - and the security system -whereas Freddie rents," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996HUD Sale Features NonperformingWashington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development's next sale willfeature $700 million in nonperforming single-family loans, with 40% of thehouses in California, Colorado and Texas.The bid date on the 16,700 loans is scheduled for March 20 and HUD is tryingto make its second single-family sale more attractive to regional lenders andsmall investors.HUD wants to lower the minimum bid requirement from the current $5 million andcreate pools in terms of performance/delinquency status and by location.But the final structure of the sale has not been determined yet and bidpackages are not expected to be ready until early February.The Federal Housing Administration-assigned loans in the sale have alreadygone through a 36-month forbearance period and the entire pool has a weightedaverage coupon of 10% with remaining maturities of 15-20 years.Hamilton Securities Group here is advising HUD on the March sale; it alsoworked on the October sale in which four winning bidders divided $524 millionin FHA one-to-four-family loans.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Home Building Slows for Three QuartersWashington-The home building industry slowed down nationwide during the firstthree quarters of 1995, with the number of single-family building permitsissued dropping in 24 of the top 25 most active major markets - and in 47 ofthe top 50 - according to the National Association of Home Builders.Jim Irvine, president of the NAHB, said, "builders across the country areexperiencing a somewhat slower year.  Housing starts in 1995 have beenleveling off since a strong 1994.  Builders should see some slight improvementin 1996, if interest rates remain in the current 7.5% range and the overalleconomy shows some growth."Atlanta was the only market among the top 25 in the nation to increase itssingle-family permits through the first nine months of 1995.  In Atlanta, themost active market, there were 26,886 single-family housing permits issued, a5.8% increase over 1994.Only two other markets in the top 50 showed increases in single-family housingstarts through three quarters.  They are Memphis, which increased 1.9%, andGrand Rapids, MI, which increased 7.8%.The second most active was Phoenix/Mesa, which despite its high ranking,experienced a 3.5% decline in the number of permits issued.  Rounding out thetop five, the third most active was Chicago, down 8.8%, fourth was Washington,DC, down 16.7%, and fifth was Las Vegas, down 5.9%.However, the NAHB said that the nationwide decline in the number ofsingle-family housing permits issued was somewhat offset by an increase inpermits for multifamily units, as multifamily construction continued itsincrease from its depression of 1993.Overall, of the top 50 most active markets for issuing single-family permits,27 declined more than 10% through the first nine months of 1995, with fivedeclining more than 20%.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Equity Roundup:  GSE Stocks Haven't Seen Their Best Days YetNew York-Smith Barney asks the question, "are Fannie and Freddie's best daysbehind them?"  Its answer, "No.  In fact, we think that there is no credibleevidence that the profitability of the two housing-relatedgovernment-sponsored enterprises has passed a peak."Smith Barney said some investors have expressed concern that the recent run-upin the stock price of the Federal National Mortgage Association and theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  might have left their shares susceptible toa free-fall.But fear that the two GSEs have become too big and are due for a downfall isnothing new.  According to Smith Barney, since 1991, doubters have been sayingthat the two companies are so big, and so dominant, that their profitabilityhas peaked.The most commonly stated reason for their contention, Smith Barney said, isthat almost 60% of all mortgages have been securitized - one of Fannie andFreddie's two basic businesses.  Doubters fear that if more than half of themarket has already been securitized, there simply cannot be much more room togrow.But Smith Barney is upbeat regarding the GSEs, saying, "we see a business thatshould be trending upward on a structural basis - leaving cyclicality and ratemovements aside - in coming years."Smith Barney cites the following:  a trend toward global funding which willbroaden the market for GSE debt and reduce funding costs, a new lendingcriteria to serve the vastly underserved affordable housing market,technological initiatives which should widen the housing market by increasingspeed and reducing origination costs, and increased expense control which willbe helped by technology.Smith Barney, however, did caution, "neither we nor our model have been ableto detect GSEs' business in a structural decline.

Becausethe underlying fundamentals for real estate are very strong right now, mutualfund managers will look to these investment vehicles for the "hedge factor,"A.G.  Edwards analyst Arthur Havener said.A low-interest environment offers REITs cheaper capital, noted Mr.  Havener,predicting the availability of 10-year financing in the 6%-7% range.  He saidleading REITs will want to amass cash in the bank "in anticipation of theacquisition market picking up again."This year, Mr.  Havener said, a number of real estate sellers are sitting onthe sidelines awaiting the outcome of the capital gains issue.  With orwithout capital gains tax relief, many will sell, and REITs will share in theharvest.The highly fragmented and undermanaged self-storage industry will offer anumber of acquisition targets that could roll up into "one big REIT," saidNAREIT's Virginia Wade.Chicago-based Real Estate Research Corp.  says pension funds in particularwill look more favorably on REITs in the coming year.  RERC surveys show that55% of pension funds intend to increase their REIT investments in 1996."REITs have matured in the last several years," says RERC researcher RobertBergson.  He said they have increased their attractiveness to traditionallyconservative institutional investors, despite the funds having been burned byREIT investments in the eighties.Cindy McHugh of Equity Residential Properties Trust concurs that REITinvestments by pension fund will increase in 1996, but said the increase willbe "very, very slow.  Their due diligence process is very extensive."And REITs are increasingly using the Internet.  NAREIT - very much involved inmaking the public more aware of REITs - has a web site, and Kranzco RealtyTrust, a shopping center REIT and pioneer in using the World Wide Web, toldNMN its Web experience has been very positive."We've gotten a lot of feedback from analysts, investors, brokers andtenants," said Michael Kranzdorf, the company's director of information.  Hesaid he expects more REITs to tout themselves on the Web because it has provenmore effective than any other medium in drawing direct inquiries frominvestors."In 1996, for the first time in several years South West Property Trustexpects the supply of new apartments in its markets as a whole to modestlyexceed demand," said a September SWP report.That potential softness in rental markets for cities like Dallas has drawnconsiderable attention, but Mr.  Puryear said people in the apartment REITindustry "are watching apartment start data very closely" in those markets and"there is a definite constraint on supply."Despite talk of an overabundance of apartment REITs, he expects the leadingresidential REITs to remain strong performers.Some apartment REIT stocks that "stagnated all year" are now "setting newhighs every day," said Mr.  Havener.  "Bay Apartments has taken off; it's nowin the $23 and change area."As REIT managers maneuver to enhance unencumbered revenues to achieve growth,1996 will continue to be a year of the balancing act.  REITs are notstructured to amass war chests.  The attractive feature of them for investors,as Ms McHugh points out, is the dividend.  Major investor Ken Heeber, who hasbeen exiting REITs this year, has been quoted as grumbling that they areshowing FFO growth of 10% to 15%, with dividends lagging at 5%.Grumbles like that can hurt.  To increase or not to increase dividend yieldsmay be a big question for REITs in 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Duff & Phelps Likes Selloff of PruHomeChicago-The sale of Prudential Home Mortgage Co., Clayton, MO, should resultin reduced consolidated financial leverage for its parent company PrudentialInsurance Co.  of America, Newark, NJ, according to a report from Duff &Phelps Credit Rating Co.  here.On the other hand, by selling the mortgage operation, Prudential loses thebenefits of "good, long-term returns" and would have to replace those tomaintain its historical corporate-wide earnings potential."It is anticipated that business opportunities to expand existing businesseswith less interest rate sensitivity and lower earnings volatility wouldeventually be sought as the strategic direction of The Prudential under itsnew chairman, Art Ryan, becomes more focused on the company's core insurance,health care and investment management businesses," DCR said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Mellon Bank Is Set to Buy Source OneFarmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing SourceOne Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises HoldingsInc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjustedbook value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million atthe end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say ithas signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for SourceOne, the spokesperson said.Mellon said it had no comment.A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, withexcess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organizationgrowing its servicing, added the spokesperson.During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject tosevere run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make upearnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, butfailed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had alsoserved as adviser in that attempt.Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of thethird quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter lastyear, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund Americanspokesperson said.The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with aportfolio of $45.67 billion.On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemicalmerger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry'sseventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears aboutrun-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule thatequalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgageservicing rights."Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry."But that is not a major consideration here."In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with itsmost significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for$165 million cash.In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicingportfolio.Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3billion servicer.Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for LomasMortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.

Dodge Division ofMcGraw-Hill.Each of the construction industry's three main sectors - nonresidentialbuilding, housing and nonbuilding construction - showed modest declines fromrelatively healthy levels.Robert A.  Murray, vice president for economic affairs for F.W.  Dodge, said,"following the generally strong level of contracting during 1995's thirdquarter, the loss of momentum in October did not come as much of a surprise."It's consistent with various signs of a slower pace for the economy, and itcontinues a pattern which has been present throughout this constructionrecovery of strengthening activity followed by a pause."F.W.  Dodge reported that during October, nonresidential building decreased 7%to $104.8 billion from September, a lackluster amount by recent 1995 standardsbut still a 4% increase over 1994's average rate.The most pronounced downturn was felt in the institutional building categorieswhere slower contracting for schools, hospitals and detention facilities ledto a 14% decline from September.  Mr.  Murray said that while institutionalbuilding has been a steady source of expansion during the past 18 months, theOctober decline is suggestive of a slowdown in growth in the near future.Other nonresidential building, such as office construction and industrialplants, also fell from recent levels.Residential construction, at $125.6 billion, fell 1% in October.  F.W.  Dodgesaid that four of the nation's five major regions reported moderatereductions, while the South Central region boasted a 5% increase.Nonbuilding construction dropped 3% in October to $59.4 billion, entirely dueto a sharply reduced amount of utility construction, which on a month-to-monthbasis can be volatile.Overall in 1995, total construction was up 1% over the first 10 months of1994.o The Manufactured Housing Institute, Arlington, VA, announced that duringOctober manufactured home shipments topped 30,000 homes for the fourth time in1995.  The shipment of 32,663 manufactured homes was a 15.6% increase overOctober 1994.  Through the first 10 months of this year, there were 286,013homes shipped, a 12.4% increase over last year.o Bell Federal Savings and Loan Association, Chicago, announced in theirSurvey of Building that total building permits for new homes and multifamilyhousing in the Chicago metropolitan area dropped 6% during October from thelevel reported in 1994.  Home permits fell 2% and multifamily permits fell16%.Throughout the metropolitan area, 2,094 permits were issued during October forsingle-family homes compared with 2,130 in 1994, with the city of Chicagonearly doubling from 75 to 140 while the suburbs fell from 1,884 to 1,776.In the seven-county metropolitan area 757 multifamily permits were issuedduring October, down from 904 last year.  Multifamily housing permits dropped9% within the city of Chicago and 19% in the suburbs.Permits issued for both single-family homes and multifamily units through thefirst 10 months of 1995 totaled 25,248, a 4% decrease from the 26,356 reportedthrough October of 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996DejaVu Half-a World AwayNew York-When the Japanese government moved just before yearend to vote amodest amount of public money to help deal with a mountain of bad real estateand housing loans, we felt the early 1980s had come 'round again.There is a strong public reluctance in Japan to the use of taxpayer money andstrong sentiment for leaving the mess to the banks involved (and those thatare not) to clean up.The decision to seek a taxpayer bailout has been politically divisive andthere is speculation that Japan's Finance Minister will resign as a result ofthe uproar.What the Japanese have done is to allocate $6.8 billion in public money tocreate an agency which will use the funds and loans from banks and otherfinancial institutions to dispose of all the bad assets (did someone sayResolution Trust Corp.?).There are eight jusen, or housing loan funds, which were created essentiallyas affiliates of other financial institutions.  The big money-center banks,many of which owned large shares in the mortgage firms, have agreed to writeoff a big chunk of the $64 billion in losses that are expected from theliquidation of seven of the eight mortgage firms.According to Thomson BankWatch, the stumbling point for some time has been theallocation of the substantial losses among the creditor group, and whether thegovernment would provide direct assistance.There are two aspects to the plan.  The allocation of approximately '6.3trillion in "first round losses" from jusen problem loans.  Second, is theestablishment of the Jusen Resolution Corp.  (JRC) to liquidate, over a10-year period, approximately '3.3 trillion in problem assets backed by someform of collateral and '3.5 trillion in performing assets.Regarding the allocation of the first round losses, founding banks of thejusen will write off 100% of loans, or '3.5 trillion.  Other bank lenders willwrite off from 40% to 60% of their loans, to total '1.7 trillion.The agricultural credit sector will write off an amount equal to less than 10%of their exposure, or '530 billion (this is the interest earned on loans madeto the jusen since initial restructuring plans started in 1993).Finally, the government will provide '685 billion in the 1996 general budgetinto seven special accounts (one for each of the housing loan companies) inthe deposit insurance authority.  These funds will also be used to cover firstround write-offs of unrecovered loans.The JRC will acquire the remaining '6.7 trillion in loans, of which about halfare nonperforming, but backed by some collateral.These assets will be purchased by the JRC at face value, with funding in theform of low-interest loans from the founding banks, the agricultural creditsector and other lenders.The JRC will be capitalized at '100 billion by founding banks and the depositinsurance corporation (the latter using funds provided by the Bank of Japan).The JRC will maintain the loans in seven separate accounts - one from each ofthe original housing loan companies.Founding banks, together with the government, are expected to share ultimatelosses on these assets, in a yet undefined ratio.The JRC, with an expected life of 10 years, will be staffed by housing loancompany employees as well as law enforcement officers, prosecutors and taxofficials.The proposal has split the ruling coalition in Japan's legislature, the Diet.While most observers expect the Diet to approve the proposed bailout as it isspelled out in the government's budget, that approval is not assured.There is a huge volume of bad loans piled up by the country's eight mortgagecompanies.  For the most part, these unrecoverable debts were put on the booksin the 1980s when the companies took on huge property deals, most of whichwent bad as the Japanese economy tanked early in this decade.Finance companies and agricultural cooperatives also were substantialinvestors.The banks and other investors in the jusen had about $130 billion invested inthem as of last March.  The seven troubled companies reported bad assetsbetween 40% and 70% of total assets.The government had encouraged formation of the jusen.  Loans from banks andothers accounted for an increasing portion of the housing market and the jusentook their surplus loan funds into highly speculative real estate deals, inmuch the same fashion as did many of the "high-flier" thrifts which ignoredhousing to take advantage of expanded powers at both the state and Federallevel.Most economists believe that on the whole, bad loans at these institutionsaccount for more than half the total.The forgiveness of loans by the big banks will be accompanied by some newlending by agricultural cooperatives and assistance from other financialinstitutions.In addition to the $64 billion already recognized as unrecoverable, someestimates are that the mortgage companies have $12 billion additional in loansthat will have to be written off.  But this is just the beginning of theprocess of cleaning up Japan's bad-debt problem.The Japanese financial system is believed to have more than $400 billion inbad debts, and the country's banks have been retreating from aggressiveforeign investment to a more insular approach.As a result, Japanese banks have been taking big losses on real estateinvestments in the U.S.  In many cases, the percentage of loss for Japaneseinvestors has equaled that of the RTC when it was selling properties acquiredby failed savings and loans.In Japan, the farm cooperatives will fare better than any of the other groupsinvolved in the government-sponsored solution.  They will be asked to makegrants and low interest loans to the new agency totaling about $5.3 billion.In exchange their $5.5 billion in claims for loans to the mortgage companieswill be repaid.Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama made no bones about the fact that it is thesocial and political importance of agriculture that shaped the decision tofavor the cooperatives in structuring the workout plan.  But the decision waspolitical with the Agricultural Ministry winning out over the Finance Ministryon the issue.This is in sharp contrast to the policy followed by the U.S.  Government,which beginning in the early 1980s followed a policy favoring the commercialbanks in each phase of the savings and loan and real estate workout, but neverhas enunciated the reasoning behind its actions.Nonbank financial institutions in Japan, which have about $17 billion on loanto the mortgage companies, can kiss that amount good-bye and are being askedto provide both capital and loans to the rescue agency.Observers suggested that the $6.8 billion in public money may be only thebeginning for the Japanese taxpayer, particularly if the economy worsensand/or real estate prices decline further.But it seems to us that the Japanese have made a pretty good start on theirproblem in contrast to a dozen years ago, when politics in this countryproduced a policy of inaction.The Federal Home Loan Bank Board had asked for $15 billion to be charged tothe thrift industry as a means of tackling the problems that were emerging inTexas, California, Arizona and Ohio, among others.The S&L industry balked, both at the size of the payment and at the idea ofthe FHLBB having that much money with which to close down institutions.Looking back, the $15 billion would not have solved the problem, but itprobably would have saved $50 billion or more of the eventual cost.Institutions that could have been shut continued to operate - and to bleed -until 1987, or even later.The industry's cost went well beyond $15 billion and if the SavingsAssociation Insurance Fund legislation is any guide, the price will go upstill further.By short-circuiting the politics and reaching down for public money in theinitial phases of its workout, the Japanese Finance Ministry likely isreducing the long-term cost to that nation's citizens.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996GlenFed Selling $2B in CMOsGlendale, CA-Glendale Federal Bank recently put $1.8 billion in fixed-ratecollateralized mortgage obligations up for sale in a move that will meantaking a $30 million after-tax loss for the quarter ending Dec.  31.About half of Glenfed's CMO portfolio had been sold by mid-December and thebank reported that it expected to complete the sale by early 1996.  Glenfedthen plans to replace the fixed-rate securities with adjustable rate assets.The CMOs are all short-term securities that were categorized as having anaverage life of two to four years when the bank purchased them about two yearsago, according to retail bank operations staff.  Most are first trancheinvestments but a few are second tranche, issued from at least 20 differentsources and backed by a diverse, nationwide base of loans.Bank president Stephen J.  Trafton said the bank took advantage of a one-timewindow of opportunity covering a 90-day period between mid-November and Dec.31, 1995 to reclassify the assets.  The move was allowed under Federalaccounting standard 115."These sales will improve our capital ratios, thus freeing up capital forpossible use in pursuing additional merger and acquisition and otherreinvestment strategies," he said.The reclassification is designed to make Glenfed's portfolio more "flexible,"Mr.  Trafton said.  A bank analyst has recently named Glenfed a takeovercandidate, but a bank spokesman said Mr.  Trafton's comment about mergers andacquisitions "has nothing to do with fattening ourselves for somebody else."In addition to putting the CMOs on the market, the bank simultaneouslyrecategorized $1 billion of its adjustable rate pass-through securitiesportfolio as "available for sale," but has no immediate plans to sell them,officials reported.The bank has been selling off loans and loan products since last year, when itmade plans to achieve a goal ratio of 70% deposits to 30% borrowings for itsconversion.  The bank's ratio of deposits to borrowings was 60% to 40% as ofits last earnings report on Sept.  30.In preparing for conversion, the bank also is bracing itself for an upcoming$47 million loss that will hit when the Federal budget reconciliation billpasses.  The loss is a one-time assessment Glenfed is being charged torecapitalize the Savings Association Insurance Fund when it converts.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Fleet Selling Mortgages To Fund NatWest BuyBoston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will putbillions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market asit sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own tofund the move.Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages andsecurities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes toretire debt."We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms ofcertain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chiefexecutive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he waspleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction andfinancing largely internally."Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combinedFleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of NewYork's president and chief executive.Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bankplans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice presidentEugene McQuade."In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doingboth at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostlyinvestment securities and residential mortgages," he said."Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yieldingassets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial andindustrial loans and consumer loans."Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment aboutthe composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be sellingto finance the acquisition.But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions ofdollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans atthat time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman saidthat Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired ShawmutNational Bank.Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backedsecurities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified asheld-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBSrepresented about 40% of their total securities holdings.Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be savedwhen Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plusbranches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in LongIsland, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cutswill be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half thepositions are expected to be lost through "attrition."After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closingslated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eightyears to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million inpayments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annualpayments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorphas agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  TheBritish company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loansand repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a fewhave expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next fewyears.In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also couldpotentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's InvestorsService, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to"positive" from "stable.""While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from abetter earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhancedrevenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening itsmarket in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and NewJersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging withShawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe theacquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company'scredit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuildcapital."The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reservecoverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisitionreduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheetclearly has a higher risk profile."Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996The Haves and Have-Notsby William J.  McDonough President, Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkMr.  McDonough recently spoke about the business community's stake inimproving inner-city areas.  His remarks were delivered at the wintermanagement conference of America's Community Bankers and have been excerptedas our Open Forum.In the long-run, I am convinced, economic development can be sustained only ifthe growing economic pie is shared by all parts of society - rich and poor,urban and rural, skilled and less skilled - and by all racial groups.  Unlessall parts of society share in and therefore have a stake in economic growth,we cannot have the social and political cohesion that is essential to sustaingrowth.I will not dwell on what government can and should do.  Those debates aregoing on in Washington, and elsewhere, and we are well aware of the issues.Broadly, I think there is widespread agreement that efforts by Federal, stateand local governments to reduce regulations can lead to lower costs, making iteasier to do business and create jobs.Moreover, it is also clear that government is a key player in improving ourpublic education system.  But government action alone is not sufficient.Government efforts require the essential underlying support of the privatesector.  Private sector participants need to redouble their efforts to bringjob growth and prosperity to all levels of our society.  This is a task thegovernment simply cannot shoulder alone.Private sector involvement is important not only for philanthropic reasons butalso for reasons of raw self-interest.  A recent report of the Committee forEconomic Development summarizes in a concise and persuasive way why each of us- particularly those who are business leaders - have a stake in the innercities.First, inner-city blight undermines the fiscal and operational health of majorcities because distressed neighborhoods contribute little to a city's tax baseyet impose heavy demands on public services.Second, cities possess significant national economic assets in the form ofproductivity-enhancing infrastructure and unique cultural institutions, aswell as anchors to the economic growth of their suburbs.  Inner-city distressweakens the value of those assets.Third, employers must rely for their future workforce on groups heavilyrepresented in inner cities.  The inadequacy of educational preparation in theinner cities can diminish the quality of this nation's human capital, a key toeconomic growth and prosperity.Fourth, the costs of inner-city problems fall on taxpayers wherever theyreside.Finally, there is an inconsistency between the isolation of our distressedurban neighborhoods and our national ideals of equality of opportunity for allpersons.I commend the CED report to you and its recommendations for greaterbusiness-sector involvement with community groups in rebuilding areas whereeconomic blight is most concentrated.  I share many of the views expressed inthe CED report and believe the time is short to act upon them.I know that you as community bankers play a particularly important role inproviding financing for local communities.  I also know that many of you arecurrently involved, as we are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in awide range of educational and community development initiatives.For example, I am well aware that banks have accomplished a great deal inactivities encouraged by the Community Reinvestment Act.  I am also well awarethat many in this audience generously support development efforts throughphilanthropic and civic organizations.In fact, I sometimes think that too little attention is given to the manysuccesses that have emerged from partnerships between business and communitygroups around the nation.  There are several key elements in those successfulefforts that provide lessons for the types of involvement that the privatesector might undertake.First, by their support and active involvement, mainstream corporations canprovide well-organized community groups with the ability to leverage thenecessary resources to initiate comprehensive community-building strategiesthat will be sustainable over the long-term.For example, the members of the South Bronx community development corporationin collaboration with such partners as the New York City Partnership and theLocal Initiatives Support Corp., and with the support of financialinstitutions and the active participation of community residents, havetransformed their part of the South Bronx from rubble-strewn lots to a vibrantcommunity.Second, the private sector can provide part of the financing required forcommunity development, and I believe that banks can and should play a greaterrole in this area.  Communities need access to capital to improve theirinfrastructure, create housing, and attract the businesses that create jobs.While financial institutions are a critical part of a comprehensive strategyand a source of capital to communities, it is important to look to otherinstitutional players as well.Third, the private sector can provide critical technical assistance.  Myinstitution, as most of you know, cannot provide capital to local communities.Nevertheless, volunteers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York haveprovided technical assistance to community-based organizations by sharingexpertise in financial analysis, computer system design, and strategicplanning.As another example, our Bank prepared a guide for small business ownersintended to facilitate communication between entrepreneurs and bankers, aswell as identify other sources of finance and assistance.  Over 140,000 ofthose pamphlets have been distributed nationwide through our offices in thelast year.Fourth, the private sector can play a key role in training our future workforce as well as retraining the adult population in the skills needed intoday's high wage industries.At my Bank, we have a team that recruits staffers to serve as mentors forlocal high school students and to speak in classrooms - thereby attempting tobridge the gap between the workplace and school.  One group has had so muchsuccess helping elementary school pupils improve their academic performancethat the students' parents have asked for a tutoring program, too.Finally, private industry can work in partnership with established localcommunity groups.  These grass-roots are the people who know theirneighborhoods and know what is most likely to work or not work.  What thesegroups do not need is others telling them what to do; what they do need is thewillingness of businesses and individuals to work in partnership with them.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996WAMU is WA Mortgage LeaderNew York-Washington Mutual Federal Savings Bank led in both single-familyfixed-rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans in the state of Washington inthe third quarter, according to figures released by TRW REDI Property Data.For the three months, the bank originated 3,464 fixed-rate residential loansfor a total of $302.1 million, a 10% market share.

Be proud of it," former RTC chiefWilliam Seidman told an auditorium full of RTC employees last month, many ofwhom now are being laid off.Led by then FDIC chairman Seidman, a cadre of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.executives built an asset management and sales organization that grew to 9,000employees despite relying extensively on the private sector.  During its sixyears, RTC issued 158,000 contracts to private firms worth $5 billion."We had a tough time getting the operation going," Mr.  Seidman admitted.  RTChad a convoluted command structure and Treasury Department officials kept theagency bound up in a confusing approval process.RTC was criticized for holding assets and was criticized at the same time forselling assets."For every Congressmen that told us to sell a property now there were thosewho said hang on to it," Mr.  Seidman said.The collapse of much of the S&L industry coincided with mounting bank failuresand a real estate market that was depressed and caught in a credit crunch.To get its sales efforts going, RTC had to restart the markets and find newways to sell failed S&Ls.This took innovation on the part of RTC executives, including president DavidCooke, thrift resolution chief William Roelle and asset sales chief LamarKelley, who were willing to experiment and learn from mistakes.RTC began by breaking up S&Ls franchises and selling the branches separatelyfrom the assets.The agency adopted a wholesale strategy for selling assets that included largepublic outcry auctions of real estate and loans, securitizations of performingand nonperforming loans and structured transactions that allowed RTC to sellreal estate or loans in $100 million multiples.RTC entered a fledgling commercial mortgage-backed securities market in 1991and issued $16.5 billion in CMBS over the next four years.  RTC alsosecuritized $23.7 billion in one-to-four-family mortgages.What was considered risky and controversial in these areas a few years ago nowis considered standard practice.RTC just concluded its eighth and last national loan auction where it sold$577 million (book value) in performing and nonperforming and nonperformingloans for $404 million or 70 cents on the dollar.And RTC just issued its last CMBS, a $325 million offering, with barely anymention or notice in the press.But many of RTC's early initiatives were not as successful.In a public relations flop, RTC had to cancel its first $300 million realestate auction because the auctioneer failed to put up $2 million formarketing expenses.RTC also tried blind sales, because it had problems finding and identifyingassets for bulk sales, and creative financing schemes, like cash-flowmortgages, so it could sell empty office buildings and hotels.These experimental transactions evolved into bulk sales, called structuredtransactions that commercial banks and insurance companies later adopted toget rid of the problem real estate assets in their portfoliosBut RTC's first structured transaction, a $180 million offering ofnonperforming commercial mortgages, raised a stink in the press because thewinning bidder Maxxam chairman Charles Hurwitz formerly owned a thrift thatfailed.Last week FDIC sued Mr.  Hurwitz for $250 million in damages, alleging hecontributed to the failure of United Savings Bank of Texas, Houston.In most instances, the buyers who stepped up to the plate first, walked awaywith the best deals.For example, G.E.  Capital Corp., Stamford, entered into an agreement with RTCto buy $1 billion in nonperforming commercial mortgages and share 25% of theprofits with RTC.The RTC Inspector General estimates that GE will make an 70% gross profitmargin on its investment.RTC learned from these transactions, however.  More buyers came to the tableand RTC got better prices once the risk takers like GE showed the way.But political fights over RTC funding and a parade of scandals and snafus tookits toll on RTC executives.  As a scapegoat, David Cooke was forced out in apolitical deal to get additional funding for RTC.The refusal of Congress to confirm President Clinton's nominee to run RTC putthrift resolution chief Roelle in a position of getting tarred in theWhitewater scandal.As the remaining executive, Mr.  Roelle briefed acting RTC chief and Treasuryunder secretary Roger Altman about RTC's investigations into PresidentClinton's ties with a failed Arkansas thrift, Madison Guaranty.Revelations that Treasury officials passed this information to the White Houseforced Mr.  Altman to resign from Treasury.Mr.  Roelle was forced to take a less visible position at RTC and he returnedto FDIC.Mr.  Kelley, who guided RTC's asset sale program, was able to leave RTCwithout a cloud.  But like, Mr.  Roelle, he left quietly and with littlethanks.One of RTC's most persistent Congressional critics has been Rep.  Bruce Vento,D., MN.  He continues to give RTC bad marks for failing to develop aninformation system to keep track of assets and contracts.And as the chairman of an RTC oversight task force for the House BankingCommittee, he was instrumental in getting RTC to adopt many managementreforms.Nevertheless, Rep Vento hopes the expertise RTC developed with its "on the jobtraining" will be transferred to the FDIC and he believes a Federal assetdisposition agency should be created to protect the taxpayer's dollars andassets."The Federal Housing Administration is an example of why the Federalgovernment ought to have this expertise," he said.FHA is in the process of selling off billions of dollars of nonperformingsingle-family and multifamily loans and it has adopted many of RTC's salespractices."They have obviously moved the assets," Rep.  Vento said.  But he cast doubton RTC's claim that it recovered 87 cents on all the assets it sold."How they come up with these figures with such a high return is sort ofquestionable," he said.The RTC figure does not take into the account the fact that the thrifts hadalready written down the loans before RTC took over the institutions."While there will always be critics pointing to places where RTC tripped orstumbled, anyone who looks at the whole picture will be impressed, Mr.  Cookeclaimed at the RTC pep rally."You successfully balanced the conflicting demands to sell assets quickly andat the best price.  At the same time, we opened up housing opportunities forlower-income families and provided new opportunities for minority contractorsand small investors," he said."Congratulations for a job well done," Mr.  Cooke said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Lenders Expect FHA Loans to Be CoveredWashington-As the partial Federal government shutdown enters its third week,lenders continue to make Federal Housing Administration loans with theunderstanding that the Department of Housing and Urban Development willprocess and insure the loans once it reopens.FHA's handling of the first shutdown gave a lot of lenders comfort, accordingto Mortgage Bankers Association staff vice president Brian Chappelle."But it is getting a little more nerve-racking as this shutdown goes on weekafter week," he said.However, the Veterans Affairs mortgage program becomes a bigger problemstarting Jan.  1 because Congress failed to extend lenders' authority tonegotiate interest rates.  As a result, VA officials set the interest rate at7% late last week.So lenders will have to make VA loans at 7%, which is a bit low and the buyercannot pay the points.  "It is going to raise a myriad of processingproblems," Mr.  Chappelle said.Meanwhile, the Government National Mortgage Association continues to guaranteesecurities for issuers that purchased commitments prior to the Dec.  16shutdown.After the first shutdown around Thanksgiving, "a number of issuers came in thedoor to purchase commitment authority so they would not be caught during theshutdown period," according to the GNMA president Kevin Chavers.But a couple of issuers didn't make it through the door.  "There is nothing wecan do for them.  There is no commitment authority to be purchased," Mr.Chavers said.Meanwhile, FHA is not processing endorsements, according to Sarah Rosenspecial assistant to the FHA commissioner.  "So lenders are taking some riskif they close a loan," she said.However, lenders can still obtain loan case numbers through CHUMs lenderaccess system and get credit checks electronically, she said.Although HUD has no funding, the Senate did confirm the nominations of Mr.Chavers to be Ginnie Mae president, John Knubel to be HUD's' chief financialofficer, Dwight Robinson to be deputy secretary for housing and urbandevelopment and Hal DeCell 3d to be assistant secretary in charge ofCongressional and public affairs.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996BRE Properties Approves Stock Option PlanNew York-BRE Properties Inc., San Francisco, has approved a plan in whichindependent directors of the company would relinquish cash compensation inexchange for stock options in BRE.Targeted minimum levels of personal investment in BRE stock also would beestablished for outside directors.Under the stock option plan, which is subject to shareholder approval, outsidedirectors of the company would waive annual retainers and board meeting feesin exchange for annual options to purchase 12,500 shares of the company'scommon stock at its then current market price.An additional 2,500 annual options could be earned for achievement of certainperformance objectives in the prior year.

Morgan & Co., New York.Investor Robert Bass created the Brazos Fund and its limited partners includepublic and private pension funds, endowments, family trusts, commercial banksand insurance companies.The fund started its acquisition train in March with $140 million in capitaland Brazos has completed 13 acquisitions ranging from a $25 millionacquisition from Home Savings of America, Los Angeles, to a $1 billionportfolio acquisition from a Canadian thrift called North American Trust Co.Brazos had a Canadian pension fund as a capital partner in the North AmericanTrust transaction, according to Brazos Partners president Rob Gidel.  JohnGrayken is the managing director of the fund.Brazos also has a strategic alliance with BlackRock Asset Investors, New York,which invests in commercial mortgage-backed securities.Brazos is currently in the process of restructuring its portfolio to see whichassets can be sold as whole loans or in securitizations.  Mr.  Gidel expectsthat the sales strategy will be set early this year.  "Our business is not toaccumulate assets under management," he said.If they are securitized, Brazos intends to retain and service the "B" piecesthrough its asset management affiliate, Brazos Advisors L.L.C., which is inthe process of being rated as a special servicer.Brazos Advisors services all of the Brazos Fund assets, including all theassets from the North American Trust deal and its share of the Kemper deal.Those deals exemplify Brazos' preference for negotiated deals and why it staysaway from competitively bid transactions such as the multifamily sales by theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development."When you get into those controlled auctions it's just not going to meet outpricing objectives," Mr.  Gidel said.  "The pricing is too rich for us."However, Brazos participated in the last Resolution Trust Corp.  loan auctionin Kansas City and actually "picked up an asset," he said."We do try to understand what is going on at these controlled auctions and seewhat the pricing is.  You never know, you may end up buying something afterthe auction from the people that win it," he said.Brazos also looked at the recent Sanwa Bank portfolio that the Japanese banksold to Berkeley Federal Bank & Trust FSB, W.  Palm Beach, FL.  The SouthernCalifornia portfolio included $160 million in performing and nonperformingmortgages.Mr.  Gidel expects the Japanese banks will be selling more assets this year."We have done three deals with Japanese banks.  We obviously think that'sgoing to be an opportunity for us in the future," he said.Through the alliances with co-investors and leveraging its capital, the Brazosfund still has $100 million to invest."We see some exciting opportunities up in Canada.  The dynamics up there lookvery similar to what we saw in the states a couple of years back," Mr.  Gidelsaid.But he expects to see fewer sales by U.S.  banks and insurance companies thisyear."However, there are interesting opportunities among operating companies thatare looking to divest themselves of real estate," Mr.  Gidel said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Bank of America To Offer Fixed-Rate Prepayment PenaltiesSan Francisco-Bank of America plans to offer up to one-eighth or one-fourth ofa percentage discount on interest rates for fixed-rate home loans that carryprepayment penalties, said Claus Lund, senior vice president of mortgage assetmanagement.A "handful" of such loans have already been made on an experimental basis,spurred by the success of Bank of America's adjustable rate prepaymentpenalties and prepayment penalties in the commercial mortgage-backedsecurities market at large, Mr.  Lund said."The MBS market will accept those loan types because they will be protectingthe investor and we believe the market will start paying up for that type ofasset," he said.  "I think a lot of investors in servicing will realize thatthis has potential."The Federal National Mortgage Association and Morgan Stanley & Co.  have showninterest in the new loan, which will penalize borrowers 2% of up to 80% oftheir outstanding loan amount if they prepay within the first three years, Mr.Lund said.So far, the collateralized mortgage obligation market is showing more of aninterest in the fixed-rate prepayment penalty loans than the mortgagepass-through market, he said.The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has been less receptive to theprepayment penalized loans, Mr.  Lund said.Previously, banks have been adverse to affixing prepayment penalties tofixed-rate mortgages because they look unfriendly to borrowers, he said.  ButMr.  Lund said he believes the discount offered for the penalties will befavorable to borrowers as well as investors."This is not something where we're going out and providing the borrower withwhat is an unpleasant asset," he said.  "This is something where the borrowercan take advantage of a better rate if they know they are going to be in theirhouse for some time."Bank of America may not be the only large lender considering making such loansat a time when low rates and refinancings have led to "purchased assetsdisappearing quicker than a snowman in July," Mr.  Lund said.  But he believesthe bank is "one of the pioneers in the field."The move marks an increased re-emphasis on securitization concerns at thebank.  Securitization and secondary market business have been comparativelylight over the past few years, but added that the bank is a long-time playerin the field, having issued the first private MBS in the mid-'70s.Thus far in the 1990s, Bank of America has securitized $2 billion to $4billion of its loans each year, he said.  This year it has done about $2.5billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securitizations and about a half billionin private issues, Mr.  Lund said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996BF Enterprises Reports Income LossSan Francisco-BF Enterprises Inc.  reported that for the three months endedSept.  30, net income was $80,000, or 2 cents per share on revenues of$1,429,000.For the same period in 1994, net income was $339,000, or 9 cents per share, onrevenues of $870,000.The company said that the reduction in income in 1995 was due primarily to alower level of lot sales to builders at the company's Meadow Pointe projectnear Tampa, FL, and a substantial decline in the rent being received during1995 from the company's commercial building in Tempe, AZ.As a result of the amendment of the original lease and the execution of a new10-year net lease of the Tempe property, annual rental revenue from thatproperty is expected to decrease to approximately $350,000 in 1995 from$505,000 in 1994, but will increase to approximately $1,450,000 in 1996.Real estate revenue for the 1995 third quarter and nine month periods included$804,000 from the sale of a commercial property in Edina, MN, for which thecompany reported a loss of $29,000.BF Enterprises is a San Francisco-based real estate holding and developmentcompany.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Equity RoundupNew YorkAMRESCO Inc., Dallas, has priced the public offering of four million shares ofthe company's common stock.

Among CCUL's concerns are retaining specialized examiners,increased operating fees, sustaining relations with NCUA includingprotecting state authority from federal encroachment and assurance that thenew regulator will promote the league's legislative agenda.        The State of California Department of Corporations, Business andTransportation Agency promulgated a proposal to transfer regulatory andsupervisory duties for credit unions, presently within the DoC, to theDepartment of State Banking.        John Annaloro, the league's senior vice president of public andgovernment relations, told California's DoC in a Dec. 9 letter that theleague's concerns "at a minimum, would have to be resolved to our completesatisfaction before credit unions could consider supporting anyconsolidation effort."        CCUL is fighting a battle that 44 other states tussled with andlost--but not necessarily to their detriment. "Consolidation isn'tnecessarily awful. The key is the supervision has to be credit unionspecific," Doug Duerr, president and CEO of the National Association ofState Credit Union Supervisors, told NCUA Watch. He said the change can bepositive because it provides additional resources, i.e. investment productexpertise and greater access to legal counsel.        The states that still have stand-alone credit union departments areAlabama, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Texas and Puerto Rico.        CCUL said the Department of Corporations is against the changeover,but the move has the backing of powerful state legislators, including thechairs of both the Assembly and Senate banking committees.        While no specific legislation to advance this action in Californiaexists now, Robert Arnould, director of legislative affairs for CCUL, saidhe will meet with California Gov. Pete Wilson's office to uncover hisintentions.        Arnould said "the proposal is part of a broader package tostreamline and bring efficiency to state government." He said thegovernor's office is very anxious to hear CCUL's concerns and it's notreally interested in moving forward unless the credit union industry hassupport. "I don't think they want a big fight with the industry. They areaware of our lobbying abilities."        CCUL also conducted a survey among state-licensed credit unionsregarding their satisfaction with the DoC and their willingness to considerconsolidation. The study found most state credit unions would rather beregulated by the DoC than NCUA. It also concluded most larger credit unionsopposed a merger while medium and smaller CUs supported it.        CCUL said the merger would be detrimental to credit unions if thenew regulatory authority didn't learn the distinctions of nonprofit goalsvs. the competitive goals of for-profit banking.        Other critical subjects CCUL broached were federal depositinsurance and generally accepted accounting principles. The league arguedcredit unions are different from other financial institutions in theserespects and warrant specialized examiners.        California credit unions have made a substantial investment intraining and computers for the DoC credit union staff. Through the use ofoperating and deposit insurance funds many millions of dollars have beenspent educating California's examiners and other officials. Therefore, theleague said, this investment would be lost if new training devices wereneeded.        CCUL also said CUs should have separate regulatory and supervisorypolicies because the league and credit unions have invested substantialresources in adopting laws and regulations that govern operations.        The league also wants assurance that consolidation results inreduced operating and examination fees for credit unions because they payfor the operation of the DoC. The league also argued state credit unionspay substantially more in operating and examination fees than their federalcounterparts.        A consolidated regulator would have to sustain a positiverelationship with NCUA, the league said. Common examination platforms,shared computer technology and other cooperative arrangements minimizeregulatory burdens for all parties, it argued. But the regulator would alsohave to protect state authority from federal encroachment, CCUL said.        In addition, CCUL's legislative agenda to recodify the credit unionlaw and seek franchise and sales tax relief would have to be maintained aswell.        Duerr said the tax issues in California and the potential change inthe regulatory environment make the climate for state-chartered creditunions in that state inhospitable. He said it's also important to note thata gray area exists as each state's regulatory framework varies somewhat.        In July 1995, a proposal was passed and signed into law by Gov.Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin that created a new department consisting ofseveral divisions, mirroring what is already law in 44 states. According tothe Wisconsin League, as a result of legislative compromise, credit unionswill be one of the divisions attached to this new department foradministrative purposes, while retaining its autonomy as a separate entitycalled the Department of Credit Unions.        The change is positive for Wisconsin credit unions because theywill gain administrative and legal assistance they lacked as a separateentity.        Gary Gores, president of the Ohio League, said his league grappledwith a consolidation bill last year. He said a bill was approved at year-end 1995 that included a compromise with the governor's office. The leaguewas able to get the Ohio government to agree to have a person on staff thatwould head up credit unions.        Gores said the league wanted to make sure credit unions wouldn't beunduly influenced by banking and thrift regulators. "In the long run itwon't hurt us. But in the short run it will be an adjustment," he said.--Melanie WaddellBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE NCUA WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996DODGING THE LOAN ASSASSINAppeals Court Rules CU Student Loans NondismissibleMembers who owe student loans to federal credit unions can't usebankruptcy as a way to avoid paying off the debt, a federal appeals courthas ruled.        The 1st U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in December is significantbecause for the first time, a court said that federal credit unions are"government units" for purposes of having educational loansnondischargeable.        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcyproceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofitorganization.        The ruling stemmed from a case brought by T.I. Federal Credit Unionin Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case wentbefore the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definitionof both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for theseloans.        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylawsprovided that shareholders get a dividend." Koban won this point inbankruptcy court.        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its caseto U.S. district court and it eventually ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.        The district court defined a CU as a nonprofit because, under U.S.bankruptcy law Section 523(a)(8), it's a "democratically controlled,cooperative, nonprofit society organized for the purpose of encouragingthrift and self-reliance among its members'."        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the"government unit" status, so the case was appealed to the 1st Circuit Courtof Appeals. The 1st Circuit said federal credit unions are, in fact,government units, so it didn't see the need to address whether it was alsoa nonprofit.        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning ofthis section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpaymentsare nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifyingas a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor'sloans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters ofeither provision," the 1st Circuit said.        Koban, reached by NCUA Watch, asked rhetorically whether thisruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bank is a"government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested the lawshould simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period. Thisruling is counter intuitive."        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn'taddress the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress isthe only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, notthe courts.        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.        According to the brief of the case, T.I. FCU advanced loans as partof its special educational loan program. This program differs from standardloan programs in that it allows for lower interest rates, gives borrowerslonger repayment periods and allows loans to be aggregated in maximumamounts greater than those permitted under personal loan programs. Theprogram also enables borrowers to simultaneously borrow additional fundsand refinance outstanding balances on previous loans.        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times forassistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into asingle promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes$32,618. His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but hislawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely.        Student loan data supplied by the Credit Union National Associationshow that for year-end 1994, the latest date available, roughly one-thirdof CUs offer just Guaranteed Student Loans (FFEL), one-third offer justnon-guaranteed student loans and a third offer both.        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage ofcredit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a CU that lends FFELs, and37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lends other typesof student loans. --Ken ReedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE NCUA WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LENDERS TO FIGHT RISE IN 1099 PENALTIESRepresentatives of the nation's lending industries are joiningtogether to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for what they believeis a plan to raise the penalties for failing to file, or filinginaccurately, so-called "information returns," the infamous 1099s.        These forms are used by lenders to report payments of dividends,interest and interest accrued on accounts but not precisely paid, forexample, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit, U.S.government securities or similar instruments.        The Clinton administration proposal is part of the budget stalematethat closed the federal government for several weeks, among otherdevelopments.        The administration submitted a proposal to the Republicanleadership in Congress Dec. 7 as an alternative to the Republican calls fordeep cuts in the federal budget that calls for increases in miscellaneousfees and closing of certain loopholes.        The proposal, aimed more at stirring indigination from thoseaffected than a plan with even a small chance of winning congressionalsupport, included several other provisions that the administration knewwould be opposed by powerful corporate interests. For example, it calls forrequiring federal banking regulators to impose examination fees on state-chartered banks.        The provision at issue appeared to be limited to payments forservices that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC.        However, according to a letter to Secretary of the Treasury RobertRubin dated Jan. 2, the lenders said that an explanation provided by theJoint Committee on Taxation Dec. 15 indicated the provision had a muchbroader scope.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE NCUA WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996NOV.

Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers toraise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effectJan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider theviews of its customers before rendering a decision, may make itsannouncement as soon as Jan. 15.        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last twoweeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and thepotential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fullydiscuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said thosedetails would be made available shortly.        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgagecompanies that have traditionally directed most of their business to FannieMae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to takeadvantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not returnrequests for comments.        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddieraised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the lastmonth, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over thechange in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knewthat to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting toFreddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't besurprised."Back to Headline List WT03-B39-6IA059-000325-B026-306http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi120.html 205.156.212.5 19970115012028 text/html 135183HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:18:09 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:00 GMTContent-length: 134993Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi120.html Sample Issue Copyright ORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNet JANUARY, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Direct Access Gives Boost to B Paper (259 words) FHA loan limits rise to match Freddie Mac's (612 words) NY mortgage brokers refund $400,000 (308 words) HUD Reexamines Broker Fee Disclosures (686 words) Fannie Goes for Stock Split and Buyback Plan (568 words) Fannie, Freddie Stocks: Outlook is Attractive (288 words) Fairbank has new nonconforming loan (120 words) Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage Unit (308 words) DLJ gets out of repos (335 words) Offices for EquiCredit (149 words) Colonial mortgage has a new joint venture (214 words) Wholesaler changes guidlines (209 words) Editorial: A Pivotal Year (613 words) Lockbox technology now is automated (604 words) Lenders 'not getting results' from CLOs so far (308 words) HFS buying Century 21 regions (393 words) Home Equity Provides Boost for California Lender (247 words) Greatland Corp. has county mortgage book (109 words) Congressmen ask a rollback on limit (504 words) Fleet will sell mortgages (852 words) First Mortgage Announces Expansion (276 words) New Jersey Bank Targets Home Improvement Loans to Low-Mod (303 words) Continental finances commercial properties (279 words) Parkway offers no income verification program (107 words) Wholesalers see 1996 in an optimistic light (600 words) Wholesalers feel impact of stricter variance rule (350 words) RESPA Guidance on Joint Ventures Coming Soon (481 words) Third of CA homes were sold at loss (270 words) Norwest Mortgage value aids rating (171 words) NLC opens office for nonconforming (170 words) NJMIC expands in states of Florida, Ohio and New Jersey (492 words) June Fourth Corp. starts wholesale (201 words) Countrywide boosted '95 wholesale volume (600 words) Celtic flavor to US mortgage deal (862 words) NY broker wants to educate borrowers (792 words) CA home sales up 4th month (627 words) Washington state is on the cutting edge for mortgages (1338 words) The benefits of making 100% loan-to-value mortgages (1047 words) HUD Sells Title One Loans (222 words) Mellon buying big wholesaler (594 words) California brokers expecting a banner year (934 words) B and C loans pose 'unique challenges' (414 words) WA gets assisted living units (677 words) Joint venture starting up for Edina, AmerUs (451 words) First Alliance Opens Salt Lake Branch (118 words) CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Direct Access Gives Boost to B PaperSan Jose, CA-Innovative Mortgage Solutions, a conduit based here, said 22% ofits total November production came from its new Direct Access product.Direct Access is a credit score-based first and second lien product.The new product has received a better than expected reception.

And neither company seems ready to change its mind, atleast not for the time being.Fannie Mae is "not reconsidering," said spokesman David Jeffers.  "We made ourdecision, and are very comfortable with it."So is Freddie Mac, according to chairman Leland Brendsel."The decision to raise our limit was an easy decision to make," he said,"because it is consistent with the purpose for which Congress chartered us;that is, to increase the availability, affordability and reliability ofmortgage credit."However, both agencies left the door ajar to the possibility that they couldchange their minds sometime in the future, though they said they have notreceived any pressure from either Congress or the Administration to do so.Noting that there has been "lots of discussion in the press" about potentialoperational problems and market stability issues resulting from two differentconforming loan limits, Mr.  Jeffers said Fannie Mae "will certainly listencarefully to our customers as they describe those issues to us in moredetail."But the vice president for corporate relations said whether or not his companywould reconsider is "way too speculative a question at this stage.""We still need to hear from our customers," he said.Mr.  Brendsel would not say unequivocally that he wouldn't change his mind,either.  But he said there "is no downside" to the higher loan limit, "only anupside for the nation and consumers.""Nearly everyone realizes that when the secondary market as represented byFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae is allowed to serve an additional group ofborrowers, they benefit from lower rates and better mortgages," he added.The Freddie Mac chairman also called on Fannie Mae to rethink its decision,remarking that "the market is not well served by having these two companiesoperate with different loan limits."Mortgage Bankers Association president Paul Reid invited Fannie Mae to followits rival, too, saying it would be "a lot easier on lenders who seek to be asassembly-line oriented as possible" if they could place all their loans "inone large bucket."Mr.  Reid predicted that Fannie Mae will "give up some market share" if itkeeps the lower loan limit, as lenders who previously did business only withthe larger, older company "will have to start" doing business with FreddieMac.Meanwhile, Federal Housing Commissioner Nicolas Retsinas indicated last weekthat he had no choice but to raise the FHA limits, saying that the floor andceiling on government-insured mortgages are "by law ...  tied to the limitsestablished under the Freddie Mac Charter Act."The new FHA floor, which is the basic nationwide limit and covers some 2,100counties, will be as follows:* $78,660 for loans on single-family homes * $100,600 for those on two-unitdwellings * $121,600 for three-unit buildings * $151,150 for four-unitstructures.In high cost areas, the FHA ceiling, which is set at 95% of an area's medianhouse price and is applicable in 122 counties, will be:* $155,250 for mortgages on single-family homes * $198,550 for those ontwo-unit buildings * $240,000 on three-unit dwellings * $298,350 on four-unitstructures.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996NY mortgage brokers refund $400,000New York-New York State regulators have forced two mortgage brokers to make$400,000 in refunds to 234 customers as a result of an alleged illegalreferral fee arrangement between the two brokers and home improvementcontractors.Equity Stars Inc., Elmsford, NY, will make $250,000 in refunds (of which$100,000 has already been returned), while PGM Enterprise Inc., Merrick, NY,refunded $150,000.According to state superintendent of banks, Neil D.  Levin, a home improvementcontractor would aggressively solicit homeowners for work and promise toobtain financing for them.The contractor then contacted one of the mortgage brokers in question that thehomeowner needed a loan.  In return, the contractor received a referral fee.There were as many as 10 contractors involved in the scheme, but most of theproblems came from two firms, a Banking Department spokesperson said.The investigation into this matter is on-going.Allegedly the mortgage broker contacted the customer but did not identifythemselves as a mortgage broker and did not make known the broker fee orsupply the proper disclosures.Consumer complaints to the Banking Department charged the brokers involvedpaid the contractor out of the loan proceeds before the work had beencompleted to the homeowner's satisfaction.There were four complaints made to the Banking Department about PGM, with oneinvolving this matter.  Equity Stars had four complaints, all stemming fromthis incident.Besides the state law violations, the referral fee payments are a violation ofFederal law, specifically the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Mr.Levin pointed out.Neither company has surrendered its mortgage broker registration.Both firms were given two-year probationary periods and are required to post asurety bond or have a pledged asset account of $25,000 for the duration.Furthermore, both must perform community service.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996HUD Reexamines Broker Fee DisclosuresWashington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development has started anegotiated rulemaking process to get various interests in the housing industryand consumer groups to agree on what mortgage broker fees should be disclosedunder the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.Currently, mortgage brokers have to disclose points and fees they receive fromconsumers and yield spread premiums or backend fees they receive from lenders.Brokers claim the disclosure of backend fees on the HUD1 settlement formplaces them at a competitive disadvantage with other mortgage lenders whoaren't required to disclose commissions or other fees paid by their employers.To avoid this disclosure, many mortgage brokers have secured warehouse linesof credit to fund loans themselves, according to Robert Lotstein, a partner inthe Washington, D.C., law firm of Buckman & Lotstein."This makes the mortgage broker a lender," he added, even though the brokermay sell the loan to the same lender who would have table funded it.  But atable funded transaction triggers the RESPA disclosure."HUD sees two issues," according to Sarah Rosen, who oversees RESPA issues forHUD and who also is the Federal government's representative at the negotiatedrulemaking table."First, does RESPA require disclosure of indirect fees and does it helpconsumers to shop and compare products," she said.  And second, where does thesecondary market start, particularly when lenders have effectively sold a loanbefore closing.  Secondary market transactions are exempt from RESPA."Brokers are looking for an even playing field," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "Itwould help the industry, if this negotiated rulemaking works, for HUD to tellus what is a secondary market transaction.  To learn what needs to bedisclosed and what does not need to be disclosed."Mr.  Lotstein attended the first negotiated rulemaking meetings on Dec.  13and 14.  Additional two-day meetings are scheduled for January, March andApril.The 18 representatives are also charged with reaching a consensus on the issueof lenders paying volume discounts to brokers.HUD has not addressed this issue before and it has not decided whether volumediscounts are an incentive or a referral fee.  RESPA was enacted 21 years agoto prohibit payment of referral fees to parties who do not contribute anythingof value to the mortgage transaction."This is a big issue," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "Lenders are saying why can't wecompensate brokers if we get a volume of business from them and take advantageof economies of scale....  Why can't we pass on some of the savings in theform of a discount."But consumer representatives say this is just another way to get around theRESPA prohibition on kickbacks and referral fees.The Federal Reserve Board also sent a staffer to attend HUD's negotiatedrulemaking meeting because several bills now pending in Congress may transferRESPA rulemaking authority to the Fed.In addition, the Fed has been wrestling with mortgage broker fees under itsresponsibility to issue rules on high cost mortgages under the Truth inLending Act.The Fed recently reversed its interpretation and now proposes to excludebackend fees paid to mortgage brokers in the calculation of the high costmortgage test.Later this winter, the Federal Reserve Board is expected to issue a final rulethat requires consumer fees paid to a broker to be included in the financecharge.  This change was mandated by the Rodash bill passed by Congress inSeptember."A new statutory provision categorizes all broker fees paid by the consumer tothe broker (or to the creditor for delivery to the broker) as finance charges,and will go into effect when the Board issues a final rule in 1996," the Fedsaid recently.The statement was made in connection with a study on finance charges the Fedis conducting for Congress as a result of the Rodash bill.The Fed is seeking public comments on finance charges and how accurately theyreflect the cost of mortgage credit.

Analysts believethese buybacks will take place in 1997."With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably abovethe statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand ourcommitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive JamesJohnson said.Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal HomeLoan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion."The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae amore diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have morethan one funding source," he added.FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,also gave its stamp of approval."Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company'scompliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that iswithdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirementsfor core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Maccurrently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stocksplit.Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in thefour-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individualinvestors."Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target priceon Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases."With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock shouldperform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Fannie, Freddie Stocks:  Outlook is AttractiveNew York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal NationalMortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been tradingnear or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for bothstocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The questionis whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies tonumerous factors."Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could bebecause a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end ofthe year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble whilethe financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both representconservative financials - a good place to be.Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are verygood, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondarymarket.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been verypositive, and this attracts investors."Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that thestocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doingreasonably well in recent weeks.But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlookfor Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Fairbank has new nonconforming loanWaterbury, CT-Fairbank Mortgage here has created a new non-conforming jumbomortgage loan program for its bank and mortgage broker correspondents.These loans can be used for purchases or refinancings and for owner ornon-owner occupied properties.Craig Cooper, executive vice president, said, "traditionally jumbo loans wereonly for those with perfect credit who could verify their income."This new product enables banks and mortgage brokers to offer jumbo loans toan expanded group of qualified customers including borrowers who have somecredit or income issues which could prevent them from obtaining conventionalfinancing."Fairbank Mortgage does business in Connecticut, Massachusetts and RhodeIsland, and operates in New York under the name Colony Mortgage.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage UnitWashington-A few weeks after it gave up on warehousing, Donaldson Lufkin &Jenrette is looking to sell a major chunk of its mortgage affiliate, FirstFranklin Financial Corp., San Jose, CA.Sources told NMN late last week that First Franklin is shopping around itsmortgage servicing portfolio which may be as large as $7 billion.First Franklin president and chief executive William Dallas, who sold thecompany to DLJ in 1994, could not be reached for comment.Last week servicing brokers said the portfolio could be a hard sell right now."A lot of what they have is California-based and it's likely they will not geta good price for it with concerns about refinancings plaguing the market," asenior mortgage official said.One West Coast servicing broker said DLJ's merchant banking unit - whichcontrols First Franklin - hopes to get as much as $100 million for the unit,"but likely won't."They were shopping it around for $100 million last year (1995)," the brokersaid, requesting anonymity.

Ifthe proponents of a disciplined fiscal policy are correct (and we think theyare) this should mean a long period of lower interest rates and generalprosperity.But there will be dislocations.  If a crackdown on entitlements is to succeed,there must be action to slow the rapid increase in Social Security payments,as well as other Federal payouts.With a huge segment of the population (the Baby Boomers) headed into its 50s,the demands on Social Security as we hit the second decade of the newmillennium will be beyond anything that could have been imagined in the earlyyears of the pension program.If our society is to stay solvent and our working-age population is to havethe same standard of living (or higher) that we enjoy, we have to assure thepreponderance of the society's wealth is not poured into retirement plans,while making certain that out senior citizens are given the "golden years"they will have earned.But these "global" issues are on the periphery of this paper's interests.  Wefocus, in order to keep your interest, on third-party mortgage lending.And, in our view, 1996 will be the defining year for the industry.With an increasing number of mortgage bankers getting out of wholesale atleast temporarily, the supply/demand balance could change the next timeoriginations move up strongly.  The broker, who has been king in the last fewbusiness upturns, may find that he needs his wholesale lender's good gracesmore than ever before.Mortgage investors have begun to differentiate between loans originated atretail and those generated by brokers.The largest of those investors, the Federal National Mortgage Association, haswarned that the quality of third-party lending must improve.In issuing that strong caution, Fannie Mae chairman James Johnson did notthreaten two-tier pricing.  Nor did he forecast a time in which the secondarymarket giant might close the window on broker-originated mortgages.But both of those solutions are distinct possibilities.  And make no mistake,Fannie Mae and its competitor the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  make therules in the mortgage market.If they decide they no longer can afford the default rate on third-partyproduct, there will be no outlets for these loans at prices that would allowbrokers to continue functioning.Should this happen, the broker community could find itself back in the role ofa hard-money lender seeking private sources for financing of its financiallystrained clientele.This obviously would be an extreme result.  But to prevent things from movingin that direction, brokers must commit themselves to insuring the quality ofthe loans they bring to the system.The industry must weed out not only those originators willing to falsifyapplications, but also those that take advantage of market conditions to earnfees by initiating transactions which roll over borrowers quarterly or evenmore often, without any inquiry from the customer.The industry now has an important function:  to lead the mortgage borrowerthrough the maze of competing products and competing lenders to the right loanfor each customer.It would be a major loss to the home-buying public if a few bad apples areable to ruin the business for everyone.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Lockbox technology now is automatedSouthBend, IN-Data-Link Systems here has automated the final step inprocessing mortgage payments.That step - closing out a mortgage account - is the only one which mortgagelenders have not traditionally outsourced, explained Sadu Thinakal, vicepresident of the Fiserv subsidiary.Lenders typically outsource mortgage payment processing to lockbox operations,to which homeowners send their monthly checks directly.The lockboxes, which usually are owned by big banks, handle all routinepayments.That excludes the final payment, which is somewhat complicated."There are many extra steps involved in processing the final payment," Mr.Thinakal said."Lenders thought the lockbox couldn't handle the final check because of theextra steps involved:  balancing the account, sending letters to the countyoffice, the tax collector etc.," he continued.Consequently, nobody had approached the lockbox operators to see if there wasa way for them to handle non-standard payments.  (Any so-called exceptionpayment, meaning it does not meet lockbox expectations, also gets routed backto the lender.)Data-Link, which is believed to be the nation's second-largest provider ofservicing software, recently did.It created a system to automate all the functions associated with paying off amortgage, so that the lockbox need only be set up for what to expect.Once the lockbox posts the account, the system handles tasks such as triggeredrelease of escrow funds and issues a triggered request to the documentcustodian to release the file.Ultimately, the system deletes the loan file from the servicing system andsaves a record on microfiche.Data-Link's so-called payoff-through-lockbox feature should allow lenders tomaintain just a skeleton staff in payoff, Mr.  Thinakal said.  By contrast, alarge lender, with at least $20 billion in servicing, would probably havebetween five and eight full-time staff manually handling payoffs today, hesaid.Besides labor savings, lenders will benefit from increased float and reducedinterest payments on mortgage-backed securities, Mr.  Thinakal said.By eliminating the typical delay involved when the lockbox facility (to whichhomeowners send their mortgage payments directly) has to send the final checkon to the mortgage company, the company should be able to deposit its money aday or two sooner, he said.Quicker processing should also ensure that the company meets the deadlinesimposed on mortgage servicers by mortgage-backed securities investors.Unless the servicer tells the investor on time what mortgages backing an MBShave paid off, the servicer is obliged to make the standard interest payments,(as if the mortgages were still current)."And they never recoup those payments," Mr.  Thinakal said.The new service is "essentially free," he said.Data-Link customers pay a $25 "transmission charge" for communicating to thelockbox operator what to expect when the mortgage is being paid off.Prior to this advance, Data-Link says, the closest anyone had come inautomating the payoff area was having a voice response unit tell customers howmuch they owed to close out their mortgage loan.Data-Link is also in the process of automating the procedure of establishingwhether a mortgaged property requires flood insurance and, if so, placing it.The firm works through a third-party vendor of flood certification services.Now servicers can manually update their systems when flood zone statuschanges, but this will be done automatically by "early 1996," Mr.  Thinakalsaid.Recent emphasis on flood insurance follows the coming into effect late thisyear of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, plus relatedrequirements from the secondary market agencies.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Lenders 'not getting results' from CLOs so farArlington, VA-Lenders are not getting results from their involvement incomputerized loan origination systems, speakers told a conference here.Robert Meceda, chairman of the electronic mortgage lending conference run byAIC, said it is a fallacy that real estate agents steer consumers to lendersparticipating on a CLO."Thirty-five percent of homebuyers are coming to the transaction with thelender identified in advance," said Mr.  Meceda, who is managing director ofthe Stratmor Mortgage Finance Group Inc.After his presentation, the head of the Alexandria, VA, investment andmortgage bank said he was citing research done by the National Association ofRealtors.Mr.  Meceda added that "230 of the 250 largest Realtors surveyed have acaptive mortgage bank, by way of a controlled business arrangement."Even apart from CBAs, he said afterward, "real estate agents typically viewthemselves as entrepreneurs, regardless of who employs them."In an attempt to avoid any problems associated with the mortgage rebounding onthem, they often avoid recommending any lender, CBA or otherwise, he said.Another speaker, Larry Walker, director of the real estate and mortgageindustry group with EDS, echoed Mr.  Meceda."CLOs are not producing the business - that has been shown by severalstudies," he said.He listed involvement with CLOs as evidence of the "sheep mentality" whichbegets the mortgage industry."One of the biggest problems with CLOs is that Realtors aren't interested,"the representative from the Plano, TX, technology giant added.Additionally, some say that Realtors' lack of technical knowledge often meansthat a CLO is a waste unless lenders employ some sort of facilitator to assistcustomers.Still others say that lenders themselves resist the CLO concept because itleads toward mortgages being viewed as a commodity, making price the onlydifference.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996HFS buying Century 21 regionsParsippany, NJ-HFS Inc.  here has agreed to purchase the six regions ofCentury 21 real estate franchise master licensees that it does not already ownfor a total of $140 million in HFS common stock.The regions involved in the sale are:  the Southwest, central California,south Florida, the Mid-Atlantic states and eastern Pennsylvania.There are more than 1,000 offices involved that generated more than $440million of real estate commissions over the last 12 months.Robert W.

A higher loan-limit"makes more low-cost mortgage credit available to more families."Republicans Rick Lazio, NY, chairman of House subcommittee on housing andcommunity opportunity, and Richard Baker, LA, who chairs the subcommittee oncapital markets and government sponsored enterprises, don't see it that way.In a letter to Freddie Mac Chairman Leland Brendsel, Reps.  Lazio and Bakersaid the decision to boost the limit flies in the face of Congressionalintent.And they threatened to ask the "appropriate authorization committees toexplore" the issue "if Freddie Mac in unclear" that Congress wants "theconforming ceiling (to) follow as closely as possible the long-term pattern inhome prices."Noting that Freddie Mac "declined" to adjust its conventional mortgagepurchase limit when the index to which it is tied showed lower housing pricesin 1994 and again in 1995, they said "a ceiling which reflects only increases ...  cannot be reconciled with this Congressional intent."If annual price decreases are not taken in the year they occur, Reps.  Lazioand Baker said, "they should at least be recaptured before any subsequentincreases may raise the limit," Reps.  Lazio and Baker said."Since this year's increase does not offset the prior years' decreases, yourceilings should remain at their earlier levels.  This is the only logicalconclusion, and the only result consistent with the intent of the statute."That's the position taken by the rival Federal National Mortgage Association,which was commended by the two congressmen for deciding to maintain its loanlimit at $203,150 for the coming year.However, Freddie Mac argued that higher loan limits are necessary to bringlower rates and better terms to homebuyers in high-cost areas.  But Reps.Lazio and Baker disagreed.Noting that prices actually have "declined dramatically" in "many high-costareas," they said the present Freddie Mac ceiling already encompasses asignificantly larger percentage of the market "in the very areas you claimneed the increases."And in a letter to Fannie Mae Chairman James Johnson, they said the privatesector has developed a viable market for the 10% of all mortgages that areabove the two agencies' purchase limits.Reps.  Lazio and Baker also told Mr.  Brendsel that at a time when theallocation of government assistance "is undergoing intense Congressionalscrutiny," now is not the time to expand Federal subsidies.The expansion of Federal credit guarantees can only help families with incomesover $100,000, they said.And because the Federal Housing Administration's loan base limit and ceilingare tied to Freddie Mac's limit, they said, it also would "consume resourcesthat could maximize homeownership opportunities for low-income families."Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Fleet will sell mortgagesBoston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will putbillions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market asit sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own tofund the move.Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages andsecurities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes toretire debt."We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms ofcertain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chiefexecutive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he waspleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction andfinancing largely internally."Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combinedFleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of NewYork's president and chief executive.Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bankplans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice presidentEugene McQuade."In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doingboth at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostlyinvestment securities and residential mortgages," he said."Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yieldingassets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial andindustrial loans and consumer loans."Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment aboutthe composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be sellingto finance the acquisition.But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions ofdollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans atthat time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman saidthat Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired ShawmutNational Bank.Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backedsecurities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified asheld-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBSrepresented about 40% of their total securities holdings.Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be savedwhen Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plusbranches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in LongIsland, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cutswill be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half thepositions are expected to be lost through "attrition."After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closingslated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eightyears to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million inpayments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annualpayments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorphas agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  TheBritish company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loansand repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a fewhave expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next fewyears.In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also couldpotentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's InvestorsService, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to"positive" from "stable.""While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from abetter earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhancedrevenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening itsmarket in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and NewJersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging withShawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe theacquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company'scredit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuildcapital."The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reservecoverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisitionreduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheetclearly has a higher risk profile."Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996First Mortgage Announces ExpansionDiamond Bar, CA-First Mortgage Corp., predicting that it will achieve neworiginations of $100 million per month in 1996, announced plans for expansionand a new operating structure.Bruce G.

Those that aren't areweeded out right away, he said.Mr.  Horwitz reviews the application of every mortgage broker, and the vastmajority have good credit and are of good character."I am 100% supportive of mortgage brokers," he declared.Oceanmark is a wholesaler in both the "B&C" (over 10 years experience) andconforming marketplaces.A number of wholesalers have entered the "B&C" area recently.The big question, Mr.  Horwitz said, is how many of them will be able tosurvive.To do so, these lenders will need to provide a consistent level of service totheir customers and make loans that will perform.Those companies that don't have the experience "may drop the ball," Mr.Horwitz said.Oceanmark is continually expanding its presence in the wholesale market,recently opening up an office in Reston, VA, to serve Maryland, Delaware, theDistrict of Columbia and Virginia.It has also expanded its Atlanta office and now has representatives all overthe eastern seaboard.Rates will have an effect on the wholesale market in 1996, said Joe Harvey,executive vice president of Countrywide Funding Corp., Pasadena, CA.Currently the industry is in a refinance market, and that will help themortgage broker.But, he added, brokers have learned their lesson from the last refi boom andhave spent the last year and a half developing relationships with Realtors andbuilders.Mortgage brokers will not forsake these relationships for refinancings, Mr.Harvey said.If rates stay where they are or move up or down slightly, 1996 will be a goodyear for the mortgage broker, he said.Mr.  Lyons predicted there will be consolidation among mortgage brokers withthe stronger ones surviving and the weaker ones falling away.Laura Kenda, marketing manager for Delta Funding Corp., a "B&C" wholesalerbased in Woodbury, NY, predicted that wholesale will continue to be strong in1996, but legal issues will have an impact on the industry.The stronger mortgage brokers will survive, but some of the larger ones willthink about becoming lenders with their own warehouse lines, because oflitigation and laws that favor lenders over brokers, she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Wholesalers feel impact of stricter variance ruleNew York-Small originators and wholesalers are the segment of the mortgageindustry most likely to be affected by new, stricter guidelines for the amountof variance allowed by Wall Street in the cash value of loans pooled fordelivery.The stricter guidelines, set late in 1995 after months of study by a PublicSecurities Association task force, decreased the variance recommended to 1%from 2%.Wholesalers that deal with a large number of smaller correspondents will facea difficult task in trying to enforce the stricter guidelines down the foodchain, said a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association.The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  also opposed the stricter variance onthe grounds that smaller originators may be hurt by it.Despite this, PSA officials have said they had to go forward with the changein guidelines because demands of technology and standardization have made astricter variance necessary."A number of things have led to (the new guidelines)," said George Miller, thePSA's vice president and assistant general counsel."Primarily there have been a tremendous amount of technological advances inpoolings and settlement advances in recent years, in particular, verysophisticated TBA and optimization systems."Mr.  Miller said he believes the technology has become accepted enough toaccommodate the majority of those involved in trading in TBA securitizationsby government-sponsored agencies.He said that the automation was "at one time the province of dealers and verylarge mortgage originators but now is available and used by just about allparticipants in the market."Mr.  Miller added that mortgage bankers are not bound by the bond tradergroup's guidelines and counterparties are free to negotiate deals outside thesuggested variance.  But MBA officials said the industry's standard practicesmake such exceptions rare."Dealers trading MBS from the interdealer trading screens cannot specify alower variance," said MBA vice president Warren Lasko, in a letter to the PSA."In our discussions, dealers have expressed a reluctance to carve out aspecial variance rule for original issue transactions."Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996RESPA Guidance on Joint Ventures Coming SoonWashington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development is developingguidelines to distinguish bona fide joint ventures between real estate brokersand mortgage bankers from shams.HUD is concerned that the structure of these joint ventures may not qualify ascontrolled business arrangements under the Real Estate Settlement ProceduresAct, and the fees paid to Realtors may be illegal."The issue is whether you have a bona fide controlled business arrangement orwhether you have a business arrangement that is designed as a sham intendingto disguise referrals," according to Sarah Rosen, special assistant to HUDassistant secretary Nicolas Retsinas.RESPA permits the payment of referral fees to affiliates in a CBA so long asdisclosures are provided to consumers and profits are distributed based on areturn on equity.In a presentation to a Mortgage Bankers Association compliance conference, Ms.Rosen characterized a sham CBA as one where a real estate brokerage firm and amortgage banking company set up a joint venture to take mortgage applicationsfrom customers in a Realtor's office.Each party invests $50 in the joint venture, which includes one employee whois the former loan officer of the mortgage company.  The employee's desk inthe Realtor's office is rented by the mortgage company.  And the venturecontracts all back-office work with the mortgage company except for taking theinitial mortgage application."Essentially, this is an entity that is not performing any work, yetcollecting significant fees with an extraordinary return in capital," Ms.Rosen said.  "That scheme seems to be on its face designed to avoid theprohibition on referral fees."The guidelines will not set capital standards or work rules for jointventures, but should provide some clarity to the industry, she said.Phillip Schulman, a partner in the Washington, D.C., law firm of Kirkpatrick &Lockhart, said the industry is looking for this kind of guidance and he hopesHUD addresses such issues in joint ventures as the paying of rent and the useof part-time employees.But to show that a joint venture has a real business purpose, Mr.  Schulmanadvises clients not to sell 100% of the mortgages to the joint venturemortgage company.  "A real mortgage broker sells to the highest bidder," hesaid.Meanwhile, HUD continues to struggle with the issue of whether employers canpay fees to employees who refer business to affiliates.And the agency has convened a working group of private sector experts toreexamine HUD's approach to computer loan origination systems.As HUD's point person on RESPA issue, Ms.  Rosen did not indicate that theagency is even close to finalizing the RESPA proposal it issued in June forpublic comment.However, HUD intends to issue guidance on joint ventures "relatively soonbecause we think it is important," she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Third of CA homes were sold at lossLa Jolla, CA-Surveys of public records by DataQuick Information Systems showthat 31.6% of all California homes sold during the first 10 months of 1995were sold for less than their original purchase price.That percentage of loss sales continues to decline from a 42.7% peak inSeptember 1993.Because of low prices, "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during thepast few years" said DataQuick CEO Donald L.  Cohn.  As a result, a higherpercentage of homes on the market "were put there because the owner was underthe gun to sell."  Many of these "have-to-sell" situations resulted in salesat a loss, he said.The median loss was $21,800 on a house sold for $199,000, originally purchasedfor $221,000.  The hardest hit areas were those, like Orange County, whichexperienced the fastest appreciation in prices during the late 80s.In 1994, 51% of Orange County resales were at a loss, down to 45.5% throughNovember 1995.Meanwhile a Chapman University study predicts existing Orange County homeswill begin to appreciate 1.4% in value next year, after a 1.3% decline for1995 and falling prices every year since 1990.Despite rising prices, says Jim Doti, Chapman's president and chief economist,higher incomes and lower interest rates will combine to boost Orange Countyaffordability - possibly beyond the national average next year.That increase in affordability and employment in the county should createconditions favorable for housing starts, which presumably explains thedecision of the homebuilder Lennar, based in Miami, to begin setting up shopin Orange County.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Norwest Mortgage value aids ratingChicago-A recent report on Norwest Corp.  by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.here cites the banking company's "flexibility to recognize the significantoff-balance-sheet values housed" in its mortgage banking subsidiary as areason for comfort in its capitalization levels.This was cited as one of the justifications for DCR assigning an "AA" ratingto a $200 million medium term note issue from Norwest Corp.Des Moines, IA-based Norwest Mortgage was the top originator in the countryduring the third quarter, with volume of $10.7 billion for the three-monthperiod, and has the fourth-largest servicing portfolio in the industry, at$100.1 billion as of Sept.  30.The mortgage operation is one of several "well-diversified" sources of revenuefor Norwest Corp."The efficiencies of scale have become apparent in Norwest Mortgage's reportedprofitability over the past year."Positively, application volume and the level of unclosed loans are at highlevels, suggesting that performance should remain strong through theseasonally slow winter months," DCR said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996NLC opens office for nonconformingChicago-National Lending Center, a non-conforming wholesale mortgage lenderbased in Deerfield Beach, FL, has opened a loan production office here.David Brigman, senior vice president and chief operating officer, said,"Illinois is a very productive state with good stability and demographics."There is a tremendous amount of equity in homes in Illinois and a good marketfor lenders."William Ringrose is managing this Midwest expansion for National LendingCenter.

Warner, an attorney, started FidelityNational three years ago "with the intention to house everyone," said Mr.Boxman.He said one of the greatest obstacles to homeownership in addition to nothaving a downpayment is not knowing the homebuying process.Mr.  Boxman said "35% of people who do not purchase a home do so not becauseof lack of a downpayment but because they don't know the how to start theprocess."To address these obstacles to homeownership, an in keeping with its aim tohouse everyone and as the company discovered, to meet the unmet needs of lowand moderate income and minority borrowers, Fidelity National has instituted acouple of themes that underly its origination process.For this year, 1996, Fidelity National will have as it theme 'Knowing How toGet Started'.  As part of that theme $20 from each loan originated will go toHabitat for Humanity.Its first theme was House New York, where in 1995 $10 from each loan wasdonated to Habitat for Humanity.  The House New York program allowed for threepercent downpayment on a single family house and five percent downpayment on atwo family house.  Mr.  Boxman said a check for $1,000 was donated to theorganization, created by former President Jimmy Carter, which builds housingthrough donations such as this and sweat equity for low and moderate incomeindividuals across the nation.Mr.  Boxman said "structuring the loan is key."  He said brokers need to beeducated on how to structure loans, particularly affordable loans.  "Here inNew York people do not have savings.They seem not to have the downpayment, butmost borrowers have jobs and incomes but somewhere they had a credit glitchthat was never fixed.," he said."Sure you need to spend a little more time with them and sometimes you need toconvince them they can buy the house," he said, but "we need to get them intoconventional mortgage programs where they can make the payments" and are notcharged excessive interest just to get a loan.One example of structuring a deal would be to use the Federal NationalMortgage Association's Community Homebuyer program or any 97% program whichallows for a seller's concession of three percent which in effect allows youto raise the purchase price three percent, have the sellers concession.  Thisallows 100% financing for the borrower who must only pay closing costs.Educating borrowers takes the form of weekly seminars which are attended byapproximately five to seven people and hosted by Mr.  Boxman's partner Mr.Warner.Mr.  Boxman said Fidelity National uses materials from private mortgageinsurance companies particularly United Guaranty Residential Insurance Corp.,and the Federal National Mortgage Corp.'s homebuyer education materials "whichare very simple to digest."  Mr.  Boxman added that Fiedlity national in itsuse expands on the materials.Additionally, Fidelity National's 10 loan officers meet with clients ofclients of realtors on an individual basis to education them on the homebuyingprocess.Mr.  Boxman said the mortgage brokerage makes between 50 to 60 loans per monthand approximately 800 loans per year.  Approximately 75% to 80% of loansoriginated are mortgage loans made to low and moderate income and/or minorityborrowers.  The other 20% or so are conventional loans.Fidelity National is completely computerized and everything is explained tothe borrower from application, verification, credit report and appraisal.The company began using laptops from its inception.  Mr.  Boxman saidtechnology is the future of the business.  This year, perhaps later thismonth, the mortgage brokerage operation will have a page on the world wideweb, expanding its reach onto the internet.The mortgage broker has a number of relationships with mortgage bankersincluding Prudential, Loan America and Countrywide to whom it sells its loans.On average its sell 20 to 25 loans to each.The mortgage brokerage operation, which makes loans in the five boroughs butfocuses on Staten Island and Brooklyn primarily, found when it entered thecommunity that low income and minority borrowers were a neglected clientele.One way it reaches out to such clientele is by working with NeighborhoodHousing Services, a community organization which refers potential borrowers."NHS may have clients interested in purchasing a house.  We interview them andset them on a course or plan to get them into homeownership.  if they followthat plan in maybe eight months they can purchase a house," said Mr.  Boxman.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996CA home sales up 4th monthLa Jolla, CA- Home sales in southern California increased for the fourth monthin a row in November when looked at on a year-to-year basis, according to areport from DataQuick Information Systems here.However, on an overall basis, for the first 11 months of 1995, home sales inthe region were down over 9% when compared with the same period in 1994.Between January and November 1995 170,703 houses were sold in the six countyarea, versus 188,137 the year before.In November itself, there were 15,983 houses sold, up 2.1% from November1994's 15,655 houses sold.This is down 2.1% from the 16,320 houses sold in October 1995, but DataQuicksaid a decline between October and November is normal, and in fact, this wasthe best November for home sales so far in the 1990s."The sales surge is coming in the entry-level part of the market."Because of low prices and low interest rates, a lot of people who couldn'tafford to buy a home before can afford to now."We're watching the numbers carefully, the increase in buying activity shouldspread into other home categories in 1996," said Donald L.  Cohn, chiefexecutive of DataQuick.Entry-level sales account for the bulk of the transactions taking place today,unlike five years ago, when sales were distributed across all categories, fromentry-level to prestige homes.This can be seen in the median sales price, which for November was $161,000,down from $164,000 in November 1994.For the first 11 months of 1995, the median home price was $160,000, down 4.8%from the $168,000 median home price for the same period in 1994.The six southern California counties studied are:  Los Angeles, Orange, SanDiego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura.A second DataQuick study found that statewide in California, fewer homes arebeing sold at a loss to the previous owner.Between January and October 1995, 31.6% of sellers said they received less fortheir property than the amount the purchased it for, a decline from 34.7% forthe same time frame in 1994.The amount of sales made a loss began to climb in California starting in early1991, and peaked at 42.7% in September 1993.In October 1995, it was 31.2%.Mr.  Cohn said "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during the past fewyears because of declining prices."So a higher percentage of the homes that were put on the market, were putthere because the owner was under the gun to sell for one reason or another."Many of these 'have-to-sell' situations resulted in a loss."We may find it shocking that three in ten sellers lose money, but we need toremember that it still means most people are making money."Hardest hit were the areas where prices appreciated the greatest during theboom period in the 1980s.For example, 45.5% of home sales in Orange County in the first 10 months of1995 were done at a loss; this is still an improvement over the 50.9% thatwere done at a loss in 1994.Ventura County, which had 52.8% of home sales in 1994 at a loss to seller, sawthat percentage drop to 40.9%.Another area were sellers were impacted was San Diego, where 41.4% of homessold in the first 10 months of last year were for a loss, down from 42.2% in1994.On the other hand, Madera County had the best results; just under 10% of homeswere sold at a loss between January and October of 1995, up from 9.5% for thesame months in 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Washington state is on the cutting edge for mortgagesSeattle-About 80 wholesale lenders are currently doing business in Washingtonstate, says John Porter, president elect of the Washington Mortgage BrokersAssociation and an owner of Mortgage Master Service Corp.  in Kent.Mr.  Porter, who is both a mortgage broker and banker and a correspondent withmore than one wholesale lender, says the state is "one of the most popularplaces in the country with wholesalers right now, because of the stableeconomy - which is more diversified and less dependent on Boeing - and homeprices, which are still appreciating at a rate of 3% to 6%."Fleet is coming back into the Northwest market, he says, as is Home Savings ofAmerica (now in the process of locating a regional branch office in Bellevueand expected to begin production in the first quarter 1996).He expects Chase "will be coming in big," once it finalizes the merger dealwith Chemical Bank.  These wholesalers will be looking for players -correspondents with experience who can close in their own name, he said.Mr.  Porter, who funds in his own name, said most wholesalers expect acorrespondent to put up $500,000 cash to be a player.But he also sees the industry shifting to accommodate the small, independentplayers who are handling 60% to 70% of the nation's mortgage originations."Small, independent mortgage brokers can move fast and make it at 1.5 points,"he said, while the big lenders, who need a 1.75 loan fee to break even, willincreasingly move toward providing back-up services for the independents.Evergreen Money Source, Bellevue, is reaping the benefits of that strategy.Gary Winslow, president and marketing director, correspondent lending divisionfor Evergreen, says his company "has increased business by 100% since he cameaboard in July, primarily by providing good service to correspondent brokers.""Our goal is to turn around and fund a correspondent's submission within 24hours and we rarely do it in less than 48 hours," he said.Prior to this year, the company mainly handled retail nonconforming loans, butits growing correspondent lending division is in an expansion mode."We're looking for quality mortgage brokers with experience, who have been inbusiness a long time.  We want to deal with the most professional mortgagebroker we can find.  We're not so heavy on net worth and financial strength aswe are on professionalism and experience.  We like them to be members of thestate mortgage brokers or bankers associations," he said.A past president of the Washington Association of Mortgage Bankers, Mr.Winslow says the most active mortgage lending areas in Washington and Oregonare Puget Sound and the Vancouver-Portland market."The Puget Sound area has rebounded nicely from last year.  It's not therefinancing boom of '92-'93, but it's very active and it could be the start ofa flood," he said.Rick Merlino, who heads the nonconforming wholesale division of EvergreenMoney Source, said the company primarily handles A and B paper in Washingtonand Oregon and just started in Idaho's Coeur d'Alene and Boise markets.The company does "a fair amount of stated income product," for nonresidentaliens who have no documentation, often Russian or Saudi citizens, he said."We've built our business in the niches," some 40% of it based on creditissues like a lack of documentation, higher LTVs, or no paper trail of a downpayment, he said.The company also funds manufactured housing loans.  While it's not yet big, itis growing, Mr.  Merlino says.The company's average loan size is around $135,000 and Puget Sound is itsstrongest market.Evergreen's nonconforming loan division is accepting new mortgage brokers andbankers.What the company looks for in a mortgage broker or banker, says Mr.  Merlino,is "a quality shop with professional people concerned with getting goodservice at a good price, with no prepayment penalties."We strive hard to be professional and to give the professional broker theservice they need.  We understand relationships.  We know they are hard foughtand hard won."We want the broker to know we'll protect their relationships, that they candepend on us to do what we say we'll do," Mr.  Merlino said.Kendall Frazier, wholesale account executive with Metropolitan Federal Savingsand Loan, said the company's "Make Sense" portfolio loan program is popularwith brokers.The program is designed for conforming loans that deviate from the normalguidelines of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae but are not bad credit risks.  She isalso seeing a lot more refinancings because of the current low interest rates.Strong mortgage origination centers in the state, she said, are King, Pierceand Snohomish Counties.Joe Ebner, vice president of mortgage production at Washington Mutual, says,"production has been marvelous for Washington Mutual, which has been thenumber one mortgage lender in Washington for 28 years and just took over asfirst in Oregon."Mr.  Ebner said the company holds a 10% market share of thePortland-Tri-County area, over 13% of the market share in King County, 14% ofSpokane County, and 13% of Pierce County.  The company's average loan size is$115,000 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Utah.Its most popular loan is the 30-year at 15-year fixed, he says, and "thepurchase market is extremely strong in both Washington and Oregon."The company funds both conforming and nonconforming loans.  On thenonconforming side, the issues are usually less than perfect credit or anunusual property.  The average loan size ranges from $200,000 to $300,000 andis limited to $400,000.The company has been a leader in manufactured home loans since 1969, he said,and is now extending 25- and 30-year loans with land valued in hundreds ofthousands of dollars.Washington Mutual is doing a number of speculative construction loans forhomebuilders and investors in the City of Seattle, he said.  "The market isstrong, not overly heated up but very stable, very strong," with loans of$500,000 moving well, he said.Continental Savings Bank has never been in the wholesale business except as amaster servicer of loans across the state for the Washington State HousingFinance Commission's (WSHFC) bond program.  But according to Rick Bennion,vice president in charge of Residential Mortgages for Continental SavingsBank, the company now has "an embryonic wholesale division."The start-up wholesale division is the result of Continental's leadership inhelping to develop, promote and originate the FHA 203k in the state.When Mellon took over U.S.  Bancorp, it agreed to originate the 203k loanproduct but it did not want to handle the contractor part of the loan deal.Yet, the 203k was one of the loan products offered in a special city housingprogram partnered by the City of Seattle, WSHFC and U.S.  Bank, designed toincrease city residency of police and fire personnel.The program offered lower mortgage rates, lower down payment requirements andlower loan and escrow fees.  It was immediately popular and quickly expandedto include all city employees.Continental, which was already a strong pipeline for the 203k, had it'scontractor inspection system in place, and knew all the players involved withthe city program, agreed to buy the product."We have never been in the wholesale business," Mr.  Bennion said.  "But whenthe Mellon opportunity came along, we saw this as a great opportunity to putour toe in the water, to invest in the infrastructure and to grow it.  Wemight consider doing it with other institutions."As the master servicer for the WSHFC's bond loan program, Continental workswith some 250 mortgage bankers and thrifts across the state.  It's own 203kprogram has nearly 200 homes under construction and over 200 more loans inprocess in Snohomish, Kitsap, King, Pierce and Spokane Counties and Vancouver,Washington as well as Portland.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996The benefits of making 100% loan-to-value mortgagesby Marianne Arbulu Vice President, National Lending Center Inc.National Lending Center, Deerfield Beach, FL, is a mortgage wholesaler doingbusiness in Florida, Georgia, Illinois and North and South Carolina.  Itoperates, according to its own promotional literature, "within the confines ofeven the most forbidding credit history."  Ms.  Arbulu has written an articleabout when 100% financing is appropriate, which is presented as our Viewpoint.A while back, I read an article in a national publication about the risks of100% financing.  While the article pointed out some very valid issues, I wasconcerned that it didn't address any of the benefits, nor did it point outways to mitigate the risks.With the advent of high LTV loans in the marketplace, we all need tounderstand which borrower benefits from this product and how to reduce oreliminate risk.Full 100% financing offers several benefits to borrowers that brokers canmarket to full advantage.  The program provides an opportunity for newhomeownership to clients who haven't had the ability to accumulate a downpayment.On a refinance or second mortgage, clients can improve their cash flow byconsolidating debts, or minimize the interest they are paying on consumer debtversus a second mortgage.  They may even gain tax advantages in this scenarioor find themselves able to use equity which was previously unavailable tothem.Risk-wise, this product is truly the last stop for the consumer.  In mostscenarios, tapping out equity renders most customers non-lendable for years tocome.  So it is crucial to understand the type of customer for whom this loanworks to full advantage.  Primarily, borrowers who fit the 100% profile haveAA credit and have never had a problem paying their bills.Let's take the case of the couple who is looking for either a full refinanceor a stand-alone second mortgage, utilizing 100% of the equity.  The idealborrowers, in this case, are people who, while they have revolving andconsumer debt in addition to their mortgage, don't need that revolving debt tosurvive on a month-to-month basis.They haven't used the consumer debt to supplement their income; therefore,they have available credit and make payments in a timely manner.  So why wouldthis couple tap out their equity?Primarily, the loan would give them the opportunity to further improve theircash flow and reduce their overall monthly expenses.  It would bring downtheir interest expense and may give them some tax benefits through interestexpense deductions by using the equity in their home as security.This customer, who prior to debt consolidation had a 45% debt ratio, now has a35% debt ratio post-consolidation.  Even with all the equity tapped out, ifthey come across unexpected monthly expenses, this couple can handle it.Now let's look at the borrower for whom this loan is not appropriate.  We havea husband and wife, salaried individuals who simply don't make enough money tomeet their monthly needs.  They have children, school expenses, car repairs,and have historically used credit to supplement their income.They are heavily indebted with both revolving and unsecured debt.  They paytheir bills on time and their credit looks spotless, but they have probablyused one set of credit cards to pay existing credit card bills.  Today theyare sitting in a difficult cash flow position with 50% or more debt ratio.If we consolidate these customers, tap out all the equity in their property,squeak them into an acceptable debt ratio, they could be headed for trouble.Now, if they need car repairs, tuition, anything we don't routinely think ofas household operating expenses, they must incur more consumer debt.They have taken themselves totally out of any lendable position.  They are nowback to using debt to supplement their income, and with the loss of theirequity, they have no remedy.  For obvious reasons, the 100% product does notbenefit these clients; in fact, it disablesThe 100% purchase, when marketed to the appropriate customer, is a goldenopportunity for brokers.  Again, the ideal borrowers are a young couple, bothworking, paying a rent similar to what a new housing payment would be, usingcredit moderately with debt ratios that are reasonable without having toconsolidate.  Their only difficulty has been in saving toward a down payment.For this kind of client, with their careers ahead of them and expectedincreases in income, the 100% loan is a prime opportunity.  It gives them theability to buy property today, at today's prices, get available tax benefits,and effect no major change in household operating expenses.The key to a successful 100% purchase loan is the term.  Most 100% loans arereally a combination 80% first mortgage and 20% second.  The 80% first is astandard 30-year amortization with a 180-month balloon.The second mortgage, however, is structured to be fully amortizing over theshortest term possible, ideally, somewhere between five and seven years.Assuming a 0-3% appreciation, the property alone will not improve the equityposition.  The only way to improve the equity position is to pay down the loanin the quickest period of time.A short-term second is almost like forced savings.  The borrowers apply atremendous amount of principal every month back to the property so that at theend of a loan with a five-year term, they could be back to a 20% equityposition.  It's as if they saved the down payment after they got the house.If these customers comfortably meet a 40% debt ratio, have moderate incomegrowth and experience moderate appreciation, they will be in good shape withina three-to-five-year period and in a position to refinance into a conformingloan, further reducing their monthly expenses.To summarize, the 100% loan is not for everyone.  It's not for the personwho's strapped.  It's not for the person who doesn't expect moderate incomeincreases over the next three to five years, and it's not for people whohaven't been able to manage their debt.  However, the broker who targets theright customer stands to do a considerable amount of business with thisproduct.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996HUD Sells Title One LoansWashington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently sold 2,707defaulted Title One loans to Sagres Co.  Inc.  in a Nov.  7 auction.  Sagresis located in La Jolla, CA.In what has been described as an effort to sell "the worst of the worst," HUDoffered a package of defaulted, unsecured Title One loans made for homeimprovement and manufactured housing purposes.  In most cases the loansdefaulted more than five years ago and have already been through extensivecollection efforts.As a result, HUD got what was expected from the sale:  very little.The winning bid was 0.66% of the total outstanding debt.  HUD sold about $25million in outstanding debt.  Since HUD was ready to write the loans off, thelow price they fetched was not much of a disappointment."The lesson is that you don't sell the worst of the worst alone," a personfamiliar with the sale said.But HUD still has about 40,000 Title One loans with a total outstanding debtof over $300 million, many of which make more promising candidates for sale.HUD is currently evaluating that portfolio, which is managed by debtmanagement centers in Albany, Chicago and Seattle, to try to determine if itmakes sense to sell the loans to the private sector.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Mellon buying big wholesalerFarmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing SourceOne Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises HoldingsInc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjustedbook value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million atthe end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say ithas signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for SourceOne, the spokesperson said.Mellon said it had no comment.A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, withexcess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organizationgrowing its servicing, added the spokesperson.During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject tosevere run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make upearnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, butfailed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had alsoserved as adviser in that attempt.Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of thethird quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter lastyear, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund Americanspokesperson said.The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with aportfolio of $45.67 billion.On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemicalmerger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry'sseventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears aboutrun-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule thatequalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgageservicing rights."Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry."But that is not a major consideration here."In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with itsmost significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for$165 million cash.In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicingportfolio.Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3billion servicer.Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for LomasMortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.  Stroble national retailproduction manager for Mellon Mortgage Co.He joined Mellon as part of the U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage deal (where he wasproduction manager), and will remain based in Portland.Mr.  Stroble is responsible for Mellon's 107 retail production officesnationwide.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996California brokers expecting a banner yearMortgage lenders doing business in California expect good news for a change.California Association of Mortgage Brokers president Virginia Ferguson toldOrigination News that 1996 is likely to be one of the biggest years forpurchase loans California has ever seen.Analysts are saying the state with the world's sixth largest economy isfinally putting quakes and base closures behind it to resume good health.  TheSouthern California real estate market is bouncing off its bottom, and thestate again outpaces the nation in job growth.  UCLA economists say Californiawill generate about 820,000 new jobs through 1998.James Chapman, president of First Security Loan Corp., one of the largestmortgage brokerages in the nation, told ON, "California is going into the yearwith a tax surplus, more businesses moving in than out, and interest ratesseeking historic lows.  We're looking forward to a great year."Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of California,said the California recovery is being led by foreign trade, hi-tech industriesand the entertainment business, with gains in income and spending outpacinginflation.The only real weak spot Mr.  Levy sees has been construction activity, andsome major builders like Lennar and Catellus are positioning themselves for abuilding recovery in the very counties, like Orange, that have most been inthe doldrums.  Mr.  Levy expects Orange County employment figures released inJanuary and February to show dramatic improvement.Has Orange County -- notorious for its county bankruptcy following a $1.2billion loss in the derivatives market and its plummeting real estate prices-- bottomed out?  Clement Ziroli, Chairman and CEO of First Mortgage Co., saysso.  "We think that because we have a very substantial book of loans there,"Mr.  Ziroli told ON.  "We've definitely seen a stabilizing of homes inforeclosure."TRW REDI analyst Nima Nattagh is not so sure:  "What we see is the decliningtrend continuing."  But Mr.  Nattagh, who sees no connection between OrangeCounty's bankruptcy and its falling home prices, does note that "for the firsttime since 1990 we have seen foreclosures decline there."Ian Wong of Mortgage Information Corp.  in San Francisco cited statisticsshowing Southern California delinquency rates declining, though remainingworse than those for the nation as a whole.A Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.  report says mortgage insurance losses"attributable to California reached 39% of all mortgage insurance losses in1994," but have since stabilized.  "DCR believes that housing prices are at ornear lows in Southern California."Mr.  Ziroli said the good news is that contracting prices have boosted homeaffordability in many parts of California, with interest rates down far enoughto make mortgage payments compete favorably with rents.Mr.  Ziroli agrees with Stan Ross, managing partner of real estate consultantsE&Y Kenneth Leventhal, that California's primary home buyer in 1996 will be afirst timer -- probably a member of an ethnic minority and/or a recentimmigrant.Were it not for foreign immigration, California's population would bedeclining, largely because of out-migration to other Western states.Given that profile of a typical California borrower, Ms.  Ferguson said theGSEs' pushing FICO credit scoring "is the most serious issues facing ourindustry today.  FICO scoring is not going to put a great deal of borrowersinto homes.  The likelihood that they are going to meet the Congressionalmandate is not very great."Ms.  Ferguson, a partner in Heritage Valley Mortgage, says her company is veryactive in working with low-to-moderate lending and first-time buyers,utilizing "numerous county MCC programs in tandem with both conventional andFHA/VA loans" to get those borrowers into homes.  She agrees that modificationof Fannie and Freddie underwriting guidelines for "vanilla" product will haveto be made in order to meet Congressional lending mandates.Ms.  Ferguson said improvements in the real estate move-up market forhigh-priced areas are being slowed by lagging state allocations for MCC bondprograms, a situation that CAMB will target for lobbying.Though California real estate prices have fallen, they still remain higherthan in most parts of the country.  California Association of Realtorspresident Rick Snyder says thousands of moderate-income Californians willbenefit from the recent HUD and FHA raises in loan limits for high coststates."Refis will be substantial but not the engine that drives the train," Mr.Chapman said, joining Ms.  Ferguson and North American Mortgage presidentTerry Hodel in predicting a healthy mix of purchase loans and refis forCalifornia in 1996.Mr.  Chapman disagrees with Mr.  Ross' prediction that technology and theInternet will make a big impact on real estate lending in1996.  "Those thingsare here to stay," said Mr.  Chapman, "but it's not as pervasive as somepeople think.  A lot of loan officers are still resistant to computers.Nothing of real substance has happened on the Internet that affects themortgage industry because there hasn't been a need for it.  It may be as longas another two to three years before that happens."He said mortgage lending is too technical and intricate to be mastered by thesoftware available on the Internet.Controlled business arrangements, on the other hand, have arrived to stay, Mr.Chapman said.  First Security has loan representatives in the offices of FrankHoward Allen & Co., a leading Northern California Realtor."CBAs are part of the mixture that will make us successful," he said.  "We'reprobably going to do a capture rate of 25 to 35%."Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996B and C loans pose 'unique challenges'Houston-EquiVantage president John Smith said he felt pressed but confidentabout the ways his B&C business manages risk during the busy month ofDecember.In fact, the unique challenges of B&C lending are exactly what Mr.  Smith saidhe likes about the work."I find (nonconforming lending) attractive because its not as cookie-cutter asconventional lending," he said.Mr.  Smith is president of both EquiVantage and servicer Transworld MortgageCorp., a legally separate business that EquiVantage was originally a divisionof.  Transworld recently completed its second securitization, totaling $75million and consisting of three classes of fixed-rate HEL certificates backed"predominately by first-liens due to current interest rate environment."Its first, similarly structured $65 million securitization was completedearlier in 1995, he said.The issues have traded "at a slight discount, 99 30/32 - effectively at parwhen priced off the yield table," and were bought by "various institutionalinvestors," Mr.  Smith said.EquiVantage has a $15 million net worth and combined the two companies haveassets totaling $65 million that Mr.  Smith is charged with overseeing.Standard & Poor's has recently reported that it is concerned with the creditquality of HEL and B&C paper, and many players in the market are dropping outafter failing to rise to the challenges of the business.  But with insurancefrom Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.  and underwriting from CS First Boston,EquiVantage's recent issue has received AAA ratings from both S&P and Moody'sInvestors Service.Mr.  Smith added that he is confident that his experience, combined withstrong staffing, marketing and capitalization that keeps the market frombecoming too crowded, will sustain the company as a player."We will be in the business long-term," he predicted.  "It's highly capitalintense, so there are substantial barriers to competitors entering themarketplace.  You need $25 million to $50 million just to get involved."Mr.  Smith's background in the nonconforming business includes five yearsworking with "programs for acquiring and securitizing" at United FinancialCompanies and previous work as a savings and loan officer."We worked with B&C loans then, only we didn't call them that," he said.  "Wecalled them loans with delinquencies."The secret to making such credits profitable comes from "evaluating yourborrowers' willingness and ability to pay over time, value of property, andpricing - charging a higher interest rate, although our rates go as low as8.5%," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996WA gets assisted living unitsSeattle-Proceeds from an $8.3 million tax-exempt bond will finance theconstruction of five assisted living facilities in Washington state to bepurchased by LTC Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust company thatprovides financing to the health care industry.The projects are being developed by Assisted Living Concepts, a for-profitcompany that serves low- and moderate-income elderly in Washington, Oregon,Texas and New Jersey.  The company will lease the completed facilities fromLTC Properties and manage and operate each of the projects.The Washington State Housing Finance Commission (WSHFC) publicly sold thebonds backed with a letter of credit by U.S.  Bank of Washington.  The bondswere issued through the Commission's Housing for the Elderly Program, whichprovides tax-exempt financing to develop the full range of living options forthe elderly.The projects are in Grandview, Walla Walla, Kennewick, Vancouver and Camas.Total cost of the project is estimated at $11.18 million, with $8.8 millioncoming from the bond proceeds."Washington state has one of the fastest growing populations of seniorcitizens in the nation," said Busse Nutley, WSHFC chair.  "Because our stateexpects to more than double the number of elderly residents between now andthe year 2020, facilities such as this are vital."Each of the five projects now under construction has 36 assisted living units,with the exception of Lexington House in Vancouver, which will offer 44assisted living units.  Occupancy for the projects is expected from December1995 through March 1996."The tax-exempt financing allows Assisted Living Concepts to lower the cost ofliving for the elderly," said Steve Gordon, chief administrative officer, ALC."Assisted living is more economical and less invasive than a nursing home andit enables seniors to maintain their independence and privacy in a homelikesetting."Fifteen percent (28) of the total new units will be dedicated to residents ator below 50% of the median income of the county in which the project islocated.  Five percent (nine) of the total units will be dedicated toresidents at or below 35% of the median income.An assisted living community bridges the gap for seniors between activeretirement communities and nursing homes.  An assisted living facilityprovides elderly senior citizens with more independence than a traditionalnursing facility, while still providing necessary nursing care and supportservices.A $5.815 million tax-exempt bond issue for a 120-unit apartment building forthe elderly was also issued by the WSHFC.  Proceeds of the bonds will be usedto construct Pacific Crest Apartments in Everett.  The project is alsoeligible to receive some $3.7 million in Federal low-income housing taxcredits allocated to the Commission."Good health starts with good living facilities," said Thomas Gray, executivedirector of Bethany of the Northwest, one of the developers of the project."With adequate housing, elderly people can sustain themselves for a longerperiod of time," he said.The tax-exempt financing and low-income housing tax credits, he added, enablesBethany to offer both housing and personal services to lower-income elderlyresidents who want to live independently as long as possible.The bonds were sold publicly, backed with a loan guarantee from Bethany.Seafirst Bank provided a 30-year letter of credit.  The City of Everett andSnohomish County helped Bethany fulfill its part of the financing agreement.The bonds were issued through the WSHFC's housing for the elderly program.Total cost of the project is estimated at $8.8 million, with nearly $6 millioncoming from the bond proceeds.  The balance will be financed primarily throughlow-income housing tax-credits.The project includes 108 one-bedroom and 12 two-bedroom independent livingapartments for seniors.  The seven-story apartment building will offerresidents panoramic views of the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges and isconveniently located within walking distance of a senior center, publiclibrary, post office and other services.All units will be affordable to elderly (aged 55 or older) residents at orbelow 60% of the Snohomish County median income.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Joint venture starting up for Edina, AmerUsEdina, MN-An investor group which includes the management of Edina Realty herehas purchased the company as well as Equity Title Services and First EdinaMortgage from First Bank Systems Inc., Minneapolis.First Edina Mortgage immediately entered into a joint venture with AmerUsMortgage, Des Moines, IA.Bradley D.

This year's budget bill provesthe point once again.  As we went to press, the budget bill (HR 2491) had beenvetoed by President Clinton.  There are talks going on between Congress andthe White House aimed at reaching a compromise budget bill acceptable by allsides.Without a crystal ball, it is impossible to predict what will happen-ifanything.  However, to alert you to the possibilities, here is a summary ofthe major proposed tax changes that were contained in the vetoed budget bill.Family tax relief.  The budget bill contains a nonrefundable tax credit of$500 that would be allowed to a taxpayer for each qualifying child under 18.The credit (subject to a phaseout) would be effective Oct.  1, 1995.  Therewould also be a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $5,000 in qualified adoptionexpenses.  An above-the-line deduction would also be provided for interest onqualified education loans and expenses for the custodial care of certainelderly family members.To combat the marriage penalty for couples filing joint returns, the ratio ofthe standard deduction for joint returns relative to single returns would beincreased annually from 1.68 in 1996 to 2.00 in 2005.Retirement provisions.  The budget bill also provides that an individual wouldno longer be considered an active participant in an employer-sponsoredretirement plan merely because his or her spouse is an active participant.The $2,000 IRA contribution limit would be indexed for inflation (for taxableyears beginning after 1996) and the phaseout income limits would be increased.Also, the budget bill would create an "American Dream IRA" with no incomephaseouts for contributions.  Withdrawals would not be includable in grossincome if the withdrawal is made after at least five years and the withdrawalis for a special purpose (i.e., first-time homebuyer (up to $10,000); highereducation; catastrophic medical expenses and distributions to unemployedindividuals), or made after the individual reaches age 59 1/2 or becomesdisabled.A new simplified retirement plan would be available for small businesses-thesavings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE) retirement plan.  SIMPLEplans would mean an end to new simplified employee pension plans after Dec.31, 1995.  There are also provisions aimed at tax simplification of thepension rules.Capital gains.  Practitioners will recognize the individual's capital gainschange-a return to a capital gains deduction.  Under the budget bill,individuals would be allowed a deduction of 50% of net capital gain.  Themaximum 28% rate would no longer apply.  For a taxpayer with a marginal rateof 39.6, the effective rate would be 19.8%.  Special rules would apply forcollectibles.  The budget bill provides that two dollars of long-term losswould offset only one dollar of ordinary income.  The changes would generallyapply to taxable years ending after Dec.  31, 1994; however, the capital lossrules would apply to losses arising in taxable years beginning after Dec.  31,1995.Indexing of capital gains is coming under the budget bill as it would allowtaxpayers, other than a C corporation, to index the basis of certain assetsfor determining gain on the disposition of any property for the holding periodwhich begins after Dec.  31, 2000.  There is a provision that would allowother assets to be treated as being required on Jan.  1, 2001 (with gainrecognized).  Another provision helping individuals is a modification andliberalization of the existing 50% exclusion for the sale of certain smallbusiness stock (would be subject to maximum rate rather than an exclusion).A particularly helpful provision would allow individuals to deduct the loss onthe sale or exchange of a principal residence after Dec.  31, 1994.  Also,gain could be rolled over more than once within a two-year period and a safeharbor is added in the case of rollovers in the case of divorce or separationfor purposes of Section 1034.  The budget bill would also liberalize theSection 121 exclusion rules.Corporations.  The budget bill would add an alternative rate of 28% on the netcapital gain of a corporation if that rate is less than the corporation'sregular tax rate.  It also would add a special alternative rate of 21% on thegain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock.  Bothchanges would generally apply to taxable years ending after Dec.  31, 1994.Alternative minimum tax.  The depreciation adjustment for purposes ofcomputing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations wouldbe repealed effective for property placed in service after Dec.  31, 1995.Also, corporations will be able to use the AMT credit to offset a portion ofthe corporation's minimum tax in excess of its regular tax in limitedcircumstances.Cost recovery.  The maximum amount that may be expensed would increase from$17,500 to 19,000 for taxable years beginning in 1996 and $1,000 annuallythrough 2002 (to $25,000 for taxable years beginning in 2002 and thereafter).The budget bill would clarify that a lessor can adjust the basis of certainimprovements upon termination of the lease.Partnerships.  A simplified flow-through method for computing the taxes ofpartners of electing large partnerships would be available.  The budget billalso provides that the taxable year of a partnership would close for a partnerwhose entire interest in a partnership terminates, whether by death,liquidation or otherwise.S corporations.  Generally effective for taxable years beginning after Dec.31, 1995, a number of changes would be made that directly benefit thosechoosing S corporations as way of doing business.  Among the many changeswould be an increase in the maximum number of shareholders to 75.Health-related provisions.  The budget bill would make significant changes tothe tax treatment of long-term care expenses and insurance.  Also, to helpalleviate the high costs of medical expenses, the budget bill also wouldintroduce a tax-advantaged Medical Savings Account.  And the deduction forhealth insurance expenses for the self-employed would increase gradually to50% for taxable years beginning in 2002.Estate and gift taxes.  The budget bill would increase the estate and gift taxunified credit by an exemption equivalent amount of $25,000 annually from 1996through 2001 to a maximum equivalent of $750,000.  It also would index forinflation after the year 2000, the unified credit, annual gift tax exclusion,the $750,000 reduction limit on special use valuation property, the $1 milliongeneration-skipping transfer tax exemption and the $1 million ceiling on thevalue of a closely held business eligible for the special 4% interest rateunder Section 6166.  There also would be a new estate tax exclusion forqualified family owned business interests for estates of decedents dying afterDec.  31, 1995.  There are a number of other estate and gift taxes changes.Extension of expiring provisions.  As with most major tax legislation, thereare a number of tax provisions that are given added or limited life or areeven reinstated.  They include:  (1) a work opportunity tax credit (similar tothe prior law targeted job credit), (2) an income exclusion foremployer-provided education assistance, (3) a research and experimentationcredit, (4) the special rule for contributions of qualified appreciated stockto private foundations, and (5) the sunsetting of the low-income housingcredit.Tax-exempt organizations.  The budget bill would add for intermediatesanctions that the IRS may invoke against certain tax-exempt organizations.Miscellaneous provisions.  There are a number of miscellaneous provisionsaimed at tax reform.  Some of the provisions would:* Generally repeal the Section 936 credit for taxable years beginning afterDec.  31, 1995.* Clarify the exclusion for damages received on account of personal injury orsickness.* Provide that there will be no rollover (Section 1034) or exclusion of gain(Section 121) for depreciation deductions attributable to principalresidences.* Generally deny Section 1034 rollover treatment to non-U.S.  citizens fornon-U.S.  principal residences.* Substantially modify the rules for foreign trust tax compliance andtreatment as well as the income estate and gift tax treatment of individualsthat lose U.S.  citizenship.The budget bill, effective for contracts completed in taxable years endingafter the date of enactment, also would modify the look-back method forlong-term contracts.  It also would extend the luxury excise tax onautomobiles through Dec 31, 2002, correct the inflation adjustment anddecrease the rate of tax by 1% per year beginning after 1996.  The budget billalso would increase the tax return preparer penalties, add a new set oftaxpayer bill of rights provisions and reform the earned income credit.Jury Still OutThe only certainties are death and taxes.  But will there be a new tax law?If there is one, what will it contain?  The answers to both questions mustwait for the smoke to clear from the budget battle that still rages on in thenation's capital as we go to press.HOWARD W.  WOLOSKY, J.D., LL.M., is executive editor of The PracticalAccountant.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE PRACTICAL ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Practitioner's UpdateCan Your Work Papers Come Back and Haunt You?Work papers, traditionally the dry stuff of an accountant's audit work, havebecome a target for clients out to grab any evidence they can to back amalpractice claim against their accountant.Accounting firms, therefore, are closely reviewing work papers and oftenmaking changes to more clearly show they followed the proper procedures in theaudit.  In most cases, work papers are altered routinely and without incident.Accounting firms usually follow their own internal policies for recording,signing and dating any changes.  There are no official guidelines onmaintaining work papers."There are no auditing standards that prescribe a methodology and maintenanceof work papers, only the fact that they need to exist," said Edmund (Randy)Noonan, chairman of the AICPA's Auditing Standards Board and a partner withKPMG Peat Marwick.Slipping from firm policyBut when firms slip away from their own policies, they can find themselves ina bind trying to explain why papers were altered in a way that might appear tomitigate a charge of malpractice.  That's what happened to Coopers & Lybrandin a recent case brought by Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  of Japan, which isaccusing C&L of altering the work papers for the 1989 audit of ValueRent-A-Car Inc., which Mitsubishi acquired in 1990.As reported in the lead story of the Nov.  2 Wall Street Journal, Mitsubishisaid it learned after the acquisition that Value had a $10 million negativenet worth, which was $4 million further into red ink than indicated in the1989 financial statement audited by C&L.  It contended that C&L erased wordsand figures and inserted new information in its work papers in an attempt toprotect itself from charges of negligence.  Mitsubishi said the changes, whichwere not dated or signed, included a note saying that C&L had receivedassurances from Value that certain liabilities didn't exist, such asdistributed customer coupons Mitsubishi now claims are worth $4 million.Mitsubishi, which obtained C&L's final work papers as part of the discoveryprocess in its lawsuit against the accounting firm, had the unusualopportunity to compare them with the original work papers, which had beenphotocopied by the accounting firm it hired to replace C&L shortly after ithad acquired Value.  But C&L insists that the changes to the audit work paperswere "totally immaterial" to a bad investment decision by Mitsubishi, whichC&L claims ignored the numbers in the financial statements that showed a 1989loss of $14 million as well as a negative worth of $6 million.  "Changes tothe work papers were made to reflect decisions made later in the auditprocess, which was reflected in the financial statements," said Patrick J.McDonnell, vice chairman of C&L's business assurances practice.Still, the fact that C&L's auditors made the changes without following firmpolicy fuels the skepticism over its intentions.  Indeed, McDonnell admittedthat any deviation from work paper policy was rare.  "Our policy is to leave atrail," he said.  "Erasing is not something we normally would do, and it'srare when work papers are not dated or signed."PrecautionsTo help prevent future incidents, C&L is rolling out a new Notes-basedpaperless audit system.  Called "CLASS," for C&L Automated Support System, itenables auditors to prepare all work papers in a Windows-based computernotebook.  The system, which is expected to be in use for all C&L clients bythe end of next year, is designed to make it easier for auditors to follow thefirm's policy for preparing and changing work papers.  The dating of changes,for example, will be done automatically.Such precautions, whether automatic or otherwise, will likely become morecommon in all firms.  The controls firms use in preparing or altering workpapers should be made with the assumption that the work papers might later beexamined for proof of malpractice.-Paul DemeryIllinois Restricts Punitive Damages AwardPlaintiffs seeking financial recourse from accountants under Illinois law willhave a tougher time proving their case.  Under a new state law that restrictspunitive damages awarded against accountants, plaintiffs are saddled with astiff requirement to prove that their accountant acted far outside of standardethical procedures.Tougher standards"Perhaps the most important part of the new law is the standard set to justifyan award of punitive damages," Tom Wetzler, director of Government Relationsfor the Illinois CPA Society, said in a recent Society newsletter.  "Thestatute requires a plaintiff to prove the CPA acted with evil motive orreckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm,and with a conscious indifference to the rights and safety of others."Wetzler added that by requiring plaintiffs to prove the justification forpunitive damages with clear and convincing evidence, the law, which becameeffective last year, demands a greater degree of proof than the ordinarypreponderance of evidence required in most civil lawsuits.Other elements of the new law limit punitive damages to three times the valueof economic economic damages and allow punitive damages to be awarded only incases where compensatory damages are awarded.Proportionate liabilityIllinois also passed and made effective last year a law that abolished theprinciple of joint and several liability and replaced it with proportionateliability, under which accountants cannot be held liable for wrongful actscommitted by other partners of their firm.  -P.D.Expect More State Tax AuditsBusinesses may have a growing need to call on their accountants:  to minimizethe onslaught of efforts to collect state taxes.Rather than impose politically unpopular tax increases to balance theirbudgets, state revenue departments are increasing their numbers of auditors,according to a survey of states by the Atlanta-based State Taxation Institute.The survey found that individual state auditors assess on average more than $1million each year.Targeting out-of-state businesses"Companies doing business in multiple states are particularly vulnerablebecause auditors specializing in out-of-state companies post higherassessments than their counterparts based in the home office," the Institutesaid.  It noted that businesses based out-of-state are likely audit targetsbecause they have less political clout, are less familiar with rules on how tocomply with state tax laws and because many businesses don't realize theyshould file returns under a state's nexus law.The Institute also noted that some states have unusually large staffs ofauditors, such as mostly rural Alabama, whose 342-auditor department is thenation's sixth largest.  Other states are extremely aggressive in out-of-stateoperations.  The Institute said Florida, for example, keeps more auditors inAtlanta (43) than the total number of auditors employed by Rhode Island (40).-P.D.CPA Exam to Become Non-Disclosed Because of ComputerizationAs of May of this year, question booklets and answers to the Uniform CPA Examwill no longer be available after the exam is given.  The change, breaking atradition followed since the exam's inception in 1917, is one of the firstmajor steps toward a planned computerization of the exam by 2000.The computer-based exam will enable CPA candidates to take the exam at anytime at hundreds of testing sites and provide for faster processing of testresults.  According to the AICPA and the National Association of State Boardsof Accountancy, which co-administer the exam, computerization will also makeit possible to create more complex questions, though essays will likely beleft out.To prepare a large enough bank of questions to be used in computer-basedtests, which could be differentiated for each candidate, exams given as of Maywill include questions that will not be included in the test taker's score butstored for later use.  This will also enable the AICPA to judge the difficultyof the questions before using them in exams.  The future use of these testquestions necessitates the non-disclosure of the exam materials.In addition, non-disclosure will enable the AICPA to re-use questionsstatistically proved to be a good measure of candidates' knowledge and skills.And it is expected to increase grading fairness by providing for statisticalcomparisons between different exams.The AICPA said it will continue, however, to issue to candidates exampreparation materials, including the unofficial answers to questions that willno longer be used in exams.  -P.D.CCH Acquired by Dutch PublisherWith three years of costly rebuilding finally behind it, legal and taxpublisher CCH Inc.  was expecting to begin showing some hefty profits in thethird and fourth quarters of this year.  "We'll see some dramatic earningsgrowth in the last quarter," said spokeswoman Mary Dale Walters.The projection of dramatic earnings growth is pale by comparison to Riverwood,Ill.-based CCH's announcement that it had agreed to be taken over by Dutchpublishing giant Wolters Kluwer NV for $1.9 billion - more than three timesCCH's expected 1990 revenue of $600 million.  Wolters' offer of $55.50 pershare caused CCH's Class A shares of stock to nearly double in value to$54.62.The two companies said the acquisition would not cause any major changes inCCH's operating philosophy or management structure, which will continue to beheaded by CEO Oakleigh Thorne.  The Thorne family, which owns 57% of CCH, hasindicated it will tender its shares to Amsterdam-based Wolters, a majorbusiness-to-business publisher of legal, tax, medical and scientificinformation with operations throughout the U.S.  and Europe.Positioned for growthCCH said it will be in an even better position to continue investing in newtechnologies, building on its successful efforts in recent years to developCD-ROM-based research materials and its ProSystem fx tax software.  Indeed,CCH said its technology was a big factor in making it attractive to Wolters,which is just beginning to develop electronic publishing products in Europe.Wolters also expects CCH to boost its efforts to expand its U.S.  operations.One area the two companies expect to further explore is how they will deliverproducts, particularly electronic ones.  CCH has already taken its initialsteps along this course by working with AT&T and MSN, the new on-line networkof the Microsoft Corp.  Traditionally, CCH has distributed its products usingits own Access technology platform.  Now, it is interested in seeing how itcan meet customer needs by catering to their preferred distribution channels."Wolters Kluwer shares [our] philosophy," said Thorne, adding that CCH's newparent is "committed to expanding technology leadership and dedicated todelivering products via the most desired proprietary and non-proprietarymedia."  CCH's product line includes The Standard Federal Tax Reporter, TheU.S.  Master Tax Guide, CCH Federal Tax Guide, and various guides on humanresources and health care.-P.D.Course Work Waiver for ACAT Tax CredentialsThe Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation (ACAT) is waiving therequired course work until July 31, 1996, for receiving the credentials ofAccredited Tax Advisor and Accredited Tax Preparer.The waiver is being offered to CPAs, licensed accountants, enrolled agents,holders of Master of Taxation or Master of Laws in Taxation degrees, attorneyswith specialist credentials in taxation, and Accredited Tax Advisors who wishto also become an Accredited Tax Preparer.Applicants seeking to become an Accredited Tax Advisor must have five years ofexperience in tax planning and consulting; Accredited Tax Preparer credentialsrequire one year of experience in tax preparation and compliance.

The law also covers attorneys.It became effective immediately when signed by Governor Pete Wilson inOctober.Like other states' LLP laws, California's offers LLP partners limitedliability protection while continuing the tax advantages granted topartnerships.  It limits the professional liability of individual partners totheir own actions, protecting them from any tort or malpractice liability ofother partners.Gale Case, president of the California Society of CPAs, said he expects manysmall as well as large accounting firms to form as LLPs, since small firmsusually can't afford as much insurance.  He added that small firms that doform as LLPs will probably begin to re-enter practice areas such as auditingthat they had considered too risky due to exposure to liability.The law stipulates that partners of an accounting firm LLP must be either aCPA, a public accountant or an accountancy corporation.  It precludes enrolledagents because they are not licensed by the state.Minimum insurance requirement.  To form as an LLP, an accounting practice mustsatisfy one of three insurance requirements:  malpractice insurance coveragenot less than $100,000 per licensed person, whether or not the person is apartner; at least $100,000 in trust or escrow cash, bank certificates ofdeposit, U.S.  Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit or insurancebonds; or a net worth of at least $10 million confirmed annually in a filingwith the California Secretary of State.  -P.D.New Privity Law In New JerseyAmong the many bills on tort reform making their way through the halls oflegislative bodies, those up against the toughest obstacles usually includemeasures on privity, which set the bounds in which accountants or othertargets can be sued by third parties.  Third parties, such as investor groups,are often the biggest source of claims against accountants resulting from theactions of the accountants' clients.But privity laws have been making some headway.  Although bills in such statesas Texas, which has passed other tort reform measures, were derailed by theaggressive lobbying of trial attorneys, efforts in New Jersey have beensuccessful in establishing strict privity standards.In New Jersey, the privity statute enacted and made effective in 1995 statesthat accountants can be liable for negligence to only two classes of potentialplaintiffs:  clients and non-clients who meet certain criteria.  The criteriafor non-clients requires the following situations:* They must have been "specifically identified to the accountant in connectionwith a specified transaction," and the accountant must have agreed that theaccountant's report would be provided to the non-client;* The accountant must have known that the non-client "intended to rely uponthe professional accounting service in connection with that specifiedtransaction";* The accountant must have "directly expressed" to the non-client, by words orconduct, an understanding of the non-client's intended reliance.  -P.D.Insurance For The AccountantThe Singer Insurance Group began in 1958 and more than 90% of its businesscomes from CPAs who refer their clients to them.  They set up a CompleteAccountants Program whereby they give seminars to accounting firms on whatthey should know about insurance for their clients.  They also do CPE seminarswhere they discuss the respective roles and responsibilities of CPAs andinsurance agents.  According to David Singer, vice president of the firm, CPAsare in a rather awkward position today.  Although they have professionalliability coverage which covers errors and omissions and although asaccountants they should be involved in the insurance process, he feels thatthey should not, however, be involved as insurance experts.  Singer believesthe accountant's primary role is to be a catalyst and to bring up ideas tothink about and then they should shift the E&O exposure to the insuranceagent.By the same token, Singer warned that accountants have to consider their owninvolvement with business interruption insurance.  He pointed out that if anaccounting firm has a fire, there is a reasonably good chance that theywouldn't need such coverage because their business isn't really beinginterrupted.  Instead, they would incur additional expenses to get back intobusiness right away.  That's known as extra expense insurance.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE PRACTICAL ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Depreciation:  Courts Turn Thumbs Down On Irs's "Collectible" StanceIt's hard to believe.  Fourteen years after Congress adopted the ACRS and thenMACRS statutory cost recovery systems, the IRS is still fighting taxpayers incourt over what can and cannot be depreciated.  In three recent cases, the IRShas been told, enough is enough.The victorious included two professional musicians who used valuable, antiqueinstruments in their work.  These cases, decided under pre-'87 law, receivedmuch attention in the media, presumably because of the inherent human interestfactor.  But an even more recent Tax Court case, involving "exotic" cars, hasapparently expanded the result of the musician cases by making it applicableunder current law.  These cases, taken together, clarify the basic law ofdepreciation and seem to show that it is still evolving.  These cases may alsojustify practitioners reconsidering their understanding of this area to besure they are not overlooking potential deductions-either for themselves orfor clients.Musicians ReduxBrian Liddle, a professional musician, purchased a 17th century Ruggeri bassviolin (or viol) in 1984 for $28,000.  He insured it for its then-appraisedvalue of $38,000.  He used it to practice at home, at rehearsals and forperformances.  The bass suffered physical deterioration from this use andeventually lost its value for performance purposes.On his 1987 tax return, Liddle claimed a deduction for $3,170 under Section168's accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS) then in effect.  The IRSdisallowed the deduction initially claiming that the viol would appreciate invalue.  Later abandoning that theory (see cases such as Noyce1), the IRSargued before the Third Circuit that Liddle could claim the ACRS deductiononly if he could first establish that the viol had a determinable usefullife.2 The IRS said this could not be done in light of the fact that the violwas over 300 years old and still appreciating in value.It also argued that the viol, as a work of art, did not have a determinableuseful life.  Generally, works of art that hang on a wall or works that areconsidered to be museum pieces are not depreciable because the Service hasruled that such items do not have a determinable useful life.3The Court reviewed the basics of depreciation both before and after 1981.Before 1981, Section 167 governed the allowance of depreciation and requiredthat the property have a determinable useful life.  See Regs.  1.167(a)-1(a)and (b).  This life was related to the asset's usefulness to the taxpayer'strade or business and could reflect economic as well as possibly physicalconsiderations.  In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) replaced thisapproach with ACRS as part of a plan to stimulate the economy.  ACRS allowed adeduction for "recovery property" under Section 168.  Recovery property wastangible property "of a character subject to the allowance fordepreciation"-used in a trade or business or held for the production ofincome.  Recovery property was assigned five categories for determining theactual amount of the deduction.The IRS argued that ACRS, then in effect, did not eliminate the pre-'81requirement that tangible personal property used in a trade or business mustalso have a determinable useful life to qualify as property of a charactersubject to the allowance for depreciation.The Third Circuit disagreed with the Service and held that only the followingtwo pre-'81 requirements had to be met:  (1) the asset must be subject to wearand tear or obsolescence and (2) the asset is used in a trade or business orheld for the production of income.The Court allowed Liddle the depreciation deduction because the viol was usedin his trade and did suffer wear and tear in that use.  The Court alsorejected IRS's attempt to classify the viol as a nondepreciable work of artbecause in Liddle's hands, the "bass viol was a tool of his trade."Richard Simon and his wife, professional violinists, purchased two 19thcentury Tourte bows which they used in their work.  The bows suffered wear andtear as a result of such use.  Although purchased in 1985, the tax year incontroversy was 1989 when the Simons claimed ACRS deductions of almost$11,000.  The same issues were raised here as in Liddle and the Second Circuitalso disagreed with the IRS, holding that IRS's argument (i.e., having tofirst show a determinable useful life) contradicted Congress's intent when itenacted ERTA.4The Court distinguished Browning5, a case involving a musician who sought todepreciate three antique violins, in which the Ninth Circuit upheld a denialof depreciation.  In Browning, the Ninth Circuit held that the musician failedto establish a useful life for the violins but Browning was a pre-ERTA caseand there was no evidence indicating that he used the instruments in hisprofessional work.Both Liddle and Simon were decided under the ACRS system that applied toproperty placed in service between Jan.  1, 1981 and Jan.  1, 1987.  After1986, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 replaced ACRS with a modified ACRS systemcalled MACRS which eliminated the concept of recovery property.Exotic CarsBruce Selig purchased in 1987 and 1988 "exotic" automobiles to exhibit at carshows for a fee.  Exotic cars are state-of-the-art, high technology vehicleswith unique design features or equipment.The cars were not set up for use on the street; they were not driven and wereused exclusively for shows or promotional photography.  Between 1987 and 1990,Selig claimed various deductions for depreciation on the cars.  The IRSchallenged whether cars maintained in pristine condition and shown for a feecould be depreciated.  The Tax Court held for Selig because the cars weresubject to obsolescence (due to the unique high-tech features), and the factthat he failed to show the useful lives of the cars was irrelevant.6The Court reviewed the history of depreciation in the tax law and the Liddleand Simon cases which had been decided under prior law.  The Court concludedthat in enacting the current version of Section 168, applicable to propertyplaced in service after 1986, Congress did not intend to reimpose the pre-ERTArequirement that a taxpayer must show a determinable useful life of theproperty.  The Court said it is following Liddle and Simon in interpretingSection 168 as restated.Richard J.  Sapinski, partner in Sills Cummis Zuckerman Radin Tischman Epstein& Gross in Newark, NJ, was Bruce Selig's attorney.  He agreed that Selig seemsto be carrying forward the result of the musician cases (Liddle and Simon)under the post-'86 law.  In fact, Sapinski was surprised that the Seligdecision was a Tax Court Memo decision rather than a reported decision.  Iexpected that the results of Liddle and Simon would apply under MACRS, saidDavid L.  Segal, sole practitioner in Philadelphia and the attorney whorepresented Brian Liddle, the bass violinist.The Selig Court listened to testimony indicating that new and improvedfeatures for the cars would come along within a few years and held that thecars had a limited useful life as show cars because of obsolescence.  It notedthat a precise useful life did not have to be determined to establish that thecars were depreciable.  It also said that the cars were not museum pieces ofindeterminable useful life.  In doing so, it distinguished Harrah's Club7, inwhich the Court of Claims did not allow a depreciation deduction for the costof restoring antique automobiles to a casino that maintained a car museum toattract business.The Selig Tax Court clearly stated that the fact that the show cars mightbecome museum pieces did not matter since it was satisfied that the exoticcars were show pieces and not museum pieces.  Sapinski explained that it wasirrelevant whether the exotic cars might become museum pieces or appreciate invalue.  "Our argument was that is irrelevant; that it's the asset's usefulnessin the taxpayer's trade or business [that is relevant]," said Sapinski.Sapinski also doesn't believe IRS will appeal Selig because it is appealableto the Third Circuit which already decided Liddle.  But he added that hethinks the IRS will still argue the basic issue.  "I would think this is acase-specific thing and I think they'll keep that option open.  If I were ontheir side, I would be looking for a lawyer with Louis 14th furniture to makean egregious case," said Sapinski.  Dr.  William Raby, CPA and editor of TheRaby Report, said, "I'm sure it's going to be appealed."  He thinks Seligmight be vulnerable as to applying Liddle and Simon to post-'86 law.Implications and Irksome QuestionsSelig should focus a new light on certain valuable assets that may benondepreciable collectibles or works of art in some circumstances butdepreciable business assets in other circumstances.  Some commentators believethat assets such as these may now be depreciable if they are used in abusiness in a manner that results in physical wear or tear or economicobsolescence.  Passive use in a business such as hanging on a wall may not beenough.  But what about assets such as antique furniture or carpeting that arepart of an office?In 1996, can practitioners say they understand depreciation?  These casesraise fundamental questions:  Is useful life necessary to depreciate an asset?If an asset is depreciable, is it always clear how to calculate the amount ofthe deduction?  "I think a lot of people were surprised that after 14 years,there was still a fundamental concept that hadn't been resolved," said AdaRousso, senior manager at Price Waterhouse in Washington, DC.Segal said, "Let me tell you what's at stake here, the depreciation deductionhas nothing to do with accounting...It is the primary tool for encouraging orslowing down capital formation.  The IRS thought there's lots more law to itthan in fact it turned out to be."Sapinski said the decision might mean depreciation has been overlooked forcertain assets such as classic furniture used in a trade or business.  Hepointed out that "Judge Halpern who decided this [Selig] case was a dissentingjudge in the Liddle and Simon cases.  He felt this would open the door todepreciation of Louis 14th furniture in a lawyer's office or other propertythat would otherwise not be depreciable because they are collector's items."Raby said, "I guess you'd have to ask yourself what it is people have thatthey are not now depreciating [which could be items being overlooked fordepreciation]."Sapinski added that practitioners should evaluate whether the assets they haveare properly classified and perhaps take a second look at what they may haveconsidered nondepreciable in light of these cases.  Segal said, "if people aregenuinely using their products in business in a way that subjects them toobsolescence, or wear and tear, then they should get a deduction becauseCongress wanted them to employ that equipment."Investment implications.  Segal, who is also president of the PhiladelphiaYouth Orchestra, suggested that the musician cases might provide anopportunity to refinance America's symphonies by placing musical instrumentsinto leasing partnerships.  Segal explained that orchestras have millions ofdollars' worth of great instruments which could be turned into cash for needyorchestras through a sales-leaseback.  An investor can buy the instruments forfull value and then lease them back to the orchestra for say a 1% per yearrental stream.  The investor can get seven years' of depreciation out it.  Theorchestra takes the purchase money and can invest part of it in an annuity anduse the rest for operating expenses.  The orchestra has no use for thedepreciation so it can pass it to investors; Liddle says as long as aprofessional musician is using it, the instrument is depreciable.How Much to Deduct?Under the current MACRS rules, among other provisions, depreciable assetsother than buildings can fall into one of six categories, i.e., three, five,seven, 10, 15 or 20-year class life.  The rate of depreciation depends on themethod, recovery period and whether the half-year or mid-quarter conventionapplies.  Tables are available to simplify the actual computation.  Congressintended to "deemphasize" the application of useful life and salvage valuewhen it reformed depreciation in 1981.While the decisions discussed in this article did not directly deal withcomputing a specific useful life, the Selig case raises a potentialdifficulty.  In Selig, the Tax Court held that the cars were depreciablebecause they were subject to obsolescence.  Sapinski said, "We didn't have toprove an exact period for useful life.  The accountant used the rates forcars, five years."  In Selig, the Court said, citing Columbia Malting Co.8 andReg.  1.167(a)-9, that a taxpayer could recover the cost of business propertyover a period shorter than the ordinary useful life of the property if thetaxpayer could show that the assets would become obsolete in the businessprior to the end of such ordinary useful life.  Selig had testified thatwithin three or four years, the cars' state-of-the-art technology couldchange.  An associate of Selig testified that the cars had a life of one ortwo years before something better came along.  Yet Selig's accountant usedfive years, the normal MACRS category for a car.Sapinski said, "It is my feeling that it would not be right [to write off thecars over a shorter period] because I think the whole premise is that youdon't have to get into these determinations because Congress has alreadychosen your slot."Raby said the issue is whether these assets (collectibles) are eligible fordepreciation under Section 168.  "That's a yes or no question.  Once you'vedecided the answer is yes, then the question is into what category do theyfall which then determines the useful life," said Raby.  He said MACRSeliminates arguments about useful life.One commentator, however, went so far as to say that in citing the ColumbiaMalting decision, Selig suggests that a taxpayer in a situation that issimilar to Selig should be prepared to show the period over which propertysimilar to the property in question has become obsolete.  This approach,however, seems inconsistent with the flow of logic indicated above.Ultimate Lesson"The main thing that you need to learn from [these cases] is that it pays tochallenge what are more or less 'received truths,'" said Raby.  He noted thatpeople had accepted that collectibles, whether they were antique cars, violinsor french desks, were not depreciable.  "I wonder how often, how many times inour daily work things come to us and we know you can't do something, and so wenever try doing it.  So, maybe practitioners have to stand back occasionallyand say 'why can't we do it?'," added Raby.MICHAEL G.  STEVENS, CPA, J.D., LL.M., is editor in chief of The PracticalAccountant.1 Robert N.

Allen didn't think that was enough.  He had an insurance agentaccompany the prisoner.Granted that didn't seem to play well with the insurance crowd but it strikesa rather interesting chord today primarily because many accountants are takinga proactive role as business consultants to their clients.  As a result,accountants are paying increased attention to the insurance carried by theirbusiness clients.Why is this so?  Why is the accountant doing so much of the work and not theinsurance broker or company?  And what's actually happening?Getting InvolvedBusinesses today want their accountants to get involved because to them mostinsurance brokers and companies appear to be glorified salesmen, only tryingto sell them more and more insurance.Alvin Goldberg, a furrier in New York City, pointed out that "most brokersdon't tell you that you're overinsured.  If anything, they tell you that youmay be underinsured."So, what is going on today is that business clients are seeking out theiraccountants to ride herd on exactly what insurance they need and what theydon't need.Add to this the fact that many businesses have little appreciation for thecasualty and liability risks to which their companies are exposed.Peter Berlant, partner in Anchin, Block & Anchin, an accounting firm based inNew York City, said that accountants today are more intimately involved withthe client's business than the broker, the insurance company or any otheradviser.  Why?  "Because we as accountants can very often identify risks thatother advisers can't.  For example, I have a client who is extremely dependenton a particular supplier.  We have advised them to obtain contingent businessinterruption insurance covering that supplier.  If the supplier has a problemsuch as something going wrong in the warehouse and can't deliver, then ourclient is protected against claims from his own customers."Berlant also believes that typically the insurance broker may not ask thequestions to get a real understanding of what the business is all about.That's where he feels the accountant can come into this.  "We don't replacethe broker but we are a resource for our clients in understanding thebusiness."Berlant illustrated this by recounting the case of a client, a wholesaleglassware importer who questioned the extent of her liability coverage.  "Wefelt that she had to have product liability insurance.  It's not an expensivepolicy but all she needed was for one glass to go from the factory to thecustomer with a chipped rim and all of a sudden even though she may not beliable, she's going to get sued."Berlant said that the accountant can also reduce costs by a simple review ofthe policy and the client's business operation.  For example, he noted that inthe workers' compensation area, the client many times overspends for insurancebecause of the classification of workers.  "It is vitally important that theworker is classified properly because that classification impacts considerablyon the ratings and charges."He pointed out that the accountant also has to know how the policy is written."The policy is subject to audit.  The auditors that the insurance companiessend in may not fully understand how the client's bookkeeping or businessworks.  For example, in most policies, the risks in workers' comp depends onthe number of hours the particular employee worked at a certain function.  Itis not supposed to be based upon wages; yet the premiums many times are basedon wages.  Most policies also exclude bonuses and overtime payments from thewage base in determining premiums.  Often, insurance auditors overlook thesethings and take the gross payroll figure instead.  Those numbers, whentranslated into premiums, can be rather significant."Nature of the ReviewVictor S.  Rich, senior partner in New York-based Edward Isaacs & Company,CPAs and financial consultants, said that the job is to make sure the areasare covered and that the insurance is adequate.  "How often we do it dependson how large the client is and how large an internal staff the client has.And, of course, what they are paying us to do or not to do."Rich explained that too often accountants jump into reviews before they knowwhat they are being asked to do.  "Are we doing an audit, a compilation, orwhat?"  he said.  "What's the nature of our engagement?"He added, "If our engagement is simply a compilation, we should not be lookingat insurance because we may be liable for not picking up something.  We lookat it when the client specifically asks the question."  He cautioned that bydoing the reverse, an accountant is extending the engagement beyond what wasanticipated when the engagement letter was signed.  "Are we compiling figures?Are we involved in a certification?  The levels of responsibility increasedepending on the nature of the engagement."How often then should these reviews be conducted?"Every time we go to a client," said Berlant.  "No matter how often or on whatbasis, insurance is part of our program.  Sometimes we will simply look to seethat they are maintaining coverage but typically once a year we go through thecoverages with the chief financial officer or the other principals of thecompany, looking not only for amounts of coverage but for the types ofcoverage."Theodore S.  Levy, partner and vice president in the accounting firm ofKamenitz Uhlfelder in Baltimore noted that his firm reviews the insuranceneeds of their clients when they do their year-end financial statements."It's part of our procedure to look at their insurance coverage.  Wescrutinize all the policies and we see if the coverage they have makes sense.This includes their limits of liability and how much inventory they areinsuring.  Sometimes, the clients say, same as last year.  We don't acceptthat because the client many times doesn't even look at their own inventorylevels."Kamenitz Uhlfelder orchestrates an administrative retreat which is acomprehensive, full-day planning session with the client's key personnel andadvisers.  Levy said, "we bring in their insurance people and we request thatthey give us a complete analysis of all the client's coverage."David Marcus, partner in the accounting firm of Paneth, Huber & Zimmerman inNew York City, said that his firm works closely with their clients' insurancebrokers and insurance companies.  "In effect, we act as the overseer in thatregard so that we are able to evaluate properly each proposal and compare oneagainst another."Marcus noted that his firm volunteers insurance reviews at least on a two-yearbasis, depending on the client.  He said that the reason for the two-yearspread is because of the proliferation today of multi-year (usually three)insurance policies.Marcus said that normally, unless something out of the ordinary happens suchas a major purchase, a change in the business, the addition of new principalsor something dramatic like an increase in premiums, they don't necessarily gointo a big review every year.Erwin Petschauer, principal in the brokerage firm of John Petschauer, Inc.  inRidgewood, N.Y., corroborated what Marcus detailed with respect to multi-yearplans.  He said that in the area of property casualty insurance, many largecompanies are writing three-year plans rather than on an annual basis.  "Toinsurance companies, it serves as a method of retention while to the businesscustomer, its fixes the premiums at a set amount for a period of time withoutany increase."  He cited General Accident Insurance Company as one companythat is using three-year plans.However, insurance brokers tend to favor an annual review.  Gerald L.  Tobias,principal in the Westchester, N.Y.-based Richwood Brokerage Company,emphasized that his firm reviews insurance religiously.  "We look at changesin exposures or limits and we review annually based on the expiration of aclient's insurance.  Most clients who are paying a lot in the way of premiumsmay even want insurance reviews more frequently."What to Look ForHaving business insurance doesn't necessarily mean that the business isprotected but having the right insurance is what it's all about."Basically, we try to stay ahead of the times," said Levy.  "For example, onepolicy that is becoming more and more popular these days because of the lawsuits now proliferating is employment-related practices liability insurance."He stressed that people don't realize how easy they can get sued forharassment or wrongful dismissal, even if they haven't done anything.  "Thiskind of insurance protects them in a number of ways:  it pays for legal feesand gives them the necessary liability coverage."Another area that companies overlook is employee benefit omissions.  "Forexample," Levy said, "if you forget to cover somebody in your group plan,you're liable if it's a benefit."  He added that "we can see the cost ofinsurance generally coming down a lot recently so we encourage our clients toprotect themselves to take advantage of this."Levy specifically noted that it is surprising how many businesses haveinadequate coverage.  For example, he pointed out an instance where employeesdrive their own cars for a business purpose.  "If there is an accident," hesaid, "they may not be covered because the car is being used for business andis insured instead for personal use.  The policy to protect this is called"Business Use of Owned Vehicle" and it is relatively an inexpensiveendorsement."Levy said that the partners in his firm constantly talk with their brokers andinsurance companies so that we are always on the alert for new products and wepass them on to our clients."Rich added that the real value an accountant brings to the table is tounderstand exactly what the insurance covers and whether it is adequate."Suppose you have a client with inventory covered at a public warehouse andthe client changes warehouses but doesn't amend the insurance to cover the newlocation?  Then it's clear what will happen and it happens more frequentlythan we would like."Rich pointed out that business interruption is important today.  "You mustmake sure that the loss coverage is sufficient.  You may have a growingcompany and your original insurance is for half a million dollars ininventory.  Now look at the company three years down the road where theinventory is running at $3 million.  But, you only have a half million incoverage.  You've got to expand the insurance with the expansion of thebusiness."He said that what he looks for is a risk reward analysis where you have todetermine what you are willing to pay for what you are willing to accept.  "Ineffect, it comes down to what's the deductible and what's the coverage?"Tobias said that he works with accountants on ways to lower premiums byraising deductibles.  "A client generally appreciates it when an accountantsays that they can save them money by raising the deductible.  If the loss canbe $4 million, is there a big difference in having a $1,000 or $5,000deductible?  Clients like this and are appreciative of accountants looking atthis to save them money."Picking the Right CoverageAccording to David J.  Singer, vice president of the Singer Insurance Group inTeaneck, N.J., there are some basic policies that accountants should review.1.  Regular General Liability.  Accountants should be looking for businesseshaving umbrella policies that cover a wide range of areas.  For example, manyinsurance companies will advocate a general insurance but will fail torecognize risk management.  "Insuring your computer is one thing," saidSinger, "but making backups and taking them offsite is even better.  It shouldbe coupled with a disaster plan.  Insurance then is just a part of riskmanagement."  2.  Fire & Theft Insurance.  Most clients have this but do theyhave any disaster recovery plans?  Singer believes that accountants mustadvise clients about this aspect.  "We know you have insurance but will itreally make you whole?  You still have to recover from the fire.  It's notjust a question of money here."  3.  Business Interruption.  This type ofpolicy will provide reimbursement for a major loss of income caused by aninsured catastrophe.  Singer notes that this is standard coverage.  "Almosteverybody writes it."  Two of the leaders offering this policy are the WausauInsurance Companies and the St.  Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company.  4.Employment Practices Liability.  This is a relatively new area to explore andit covers areas such as sexual harassment, discrimination, wrongfultermination and the like.  Many accountants working hand-in-hand withemployment practices attorneys will advocate the preparation of an employeehandbook or manual.  5.  The coverage here is not yet mainstream.  Only alimited number of companies such as Chubb, American International and Pen Ex,to name a few, are writing this policy.  Some insurance companies will onlylook at it if the business has a minimum number of employees.  6.  EmployeeBenefit Liability.  This is coverage that protects the employer from theliability in the administration of the Employee Benefit Plan.  It is becomingmore and more popular today with the increase in such plans.  This policywould include improperly counseling plan participants, improperly interpretingcoverages, handling records carelessly and failing to enroll or terminate planparticipants.  7.  Employee Dishonesty Coverage.  This is highly importanttoday, insisted Singer.  "As we know, when someone steals, the client sues theaccountant because the client thinks that the accountant should have beenSherlock Holmes.  We advise accountants to encourage all their clients to havethis type of coverage."Singer also recommended that accountants be aware of specialty-type coverages.For example, if the client is in a particular business, such as the travel,entertainment, advertising or computer industries, insurance coverage shouldbe provided for professional liability or errors and omissions.There is also the multi-peril policy that is a combination policy includingproperty, liability, bonding, valuable papers, business interruption and othercoverages.  The advantage here is that there are often discounts available forsuch a combination package policy.In addition, products liability is important and is usually made part of thegeneral liability policy.The so-called umbrella policy is another layer of liability coverage on top ofbasic liability policies such as automobile and general liability.  Thispolicy offers broader coverage and picks up exposures such as excess coverageunder specific personal policies (e.g., personal liability and automobile)that might not be covered in the basic policy.Key-person life insurance coverage should also be considered.  Robert Rudolf,managing partner of Richwood Brokerage, estimated that only about a quarter oftoday's businesses have key-person insurance .  "Key-policy coverage pays cashdirectly to the company as the policy beneficiary when the key person eitherdies or becomes disabled.  For example, you can insure someone for $50,000 or$50 million.  The idea is to peg it to that person's worth to the company,"concluded Rudolf.There are a wide range of other policies to consider such as deferredcompensation indemnification that applies to officers and directors ofcompanies, disability insurance and of course, group health insurance which isbecoming more and more involved.Part of any accountant's job is reviewing the insurance schedule.Traditionally, accountants review an insurance schedule, said Marcus.  "Forexample, with plants and equipment, we want to be certain that the coverage isadequate and to be sure it's the right type such as replacement cost versusoriginal cost.  We also check the inventory on hand to afford the client afull review of what they require to cover their inventory properly."However, when reviewing such a schedule, Singer mentioned some concretecautions.  "Take the business interruption policy.  There is generally aworksheet involved and that worksheet is very often filled out by accountants.It should not be!  What the client is doing is making a projection of whattheir profits will be and if they have a fire and they are underinsured, theywill sue the accountant if the accountant filled out that worksheet.  Theaccountant can help the client but the client is the one making theprojections.  In fact, the engagement letter the accountant has with theclient must have a disclaimer that those numbers are the client's and not theaccountant's."Picking the Right BrokerWhen it comes to finding a broker, Singer believes that the accountant shouldbe looking at the following areas:1.  Departmentalization within the insurance group because personal insurance,commercial, life and group health should be handled by different people.  2.Affiliation with at least a half dozen major insurance companies.  3.  Aspecific claims department because claims people are a special breed and theyknow how to deal with insurance companies.  4.  Ability to put together a riskmanagement program.  The broker shouldn't be just an order taker.Verifying Adequate InsuranceIn today's economic climate, many businesses look to the accountant to protecttheir interests.  There are few conditions that can reverse the fortunes of asuccessful company as quickly as the lack of adequate insurance coverage.According to Robert L.  Gray, executive director of the New York State Societyof CPAs, one of the most important services accountants can provide to protectthemselves and their clients is to verify that adequate insurance is beingcarried that will cover the most common and in some cases even remotecasualties.  Gray said that "This requires that the accountant have afunctional knowledge of the types of insurance available and the ability todetermine if the client is adequately covered."Gray added that "the accountant need not be an insurance specialist but mustbe able to work with and feel confident in the ability of a client's insuranceagent."STUART KAHAN is staff editor of The Practical Accountant.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE PRACTICAL ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996INSIDE THE IRSProviding Direct Deposit of Refunds to 1040 Paper Filers Instead of yourclients waiting for their refunds to come via the postal worker, they can nowsee them directly deposited in their checking or savings accounts.The IRS has released Form 8888, Direct Deposit of Refund, which can becompleted and attached to Form 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ, 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ.  TheService will then send the refund directly to the client's financialinstitution provided, of course, it is one that will accept direct deposits.The Service said that the form cannot be used if the taxpayer is filingelectronically.  In that instance, there must be a specific request for directdeposit by using Form 8453, 8453-OL or 8453-NR.It also does not apply to Form 1040PC (since direct deposit election can bemade with that form) or if the taxpayer is filing a tax return for a prioryear; Form 8888 can only be used for the current year returns.  In addition,it doesn't apply to a deceased taxpayer or where a joint return is being filedas a surviving spouse.The IRS said that it has not yet made any provision for notifying the taxpayerwhen the direct deposit has actually been made.  For now, it will be up to thetaxpayers to check with their own financial institutions to determine if themoney has been received.  Finally, the Service said that it will only makedirect deposits to accounts in U.S.  financial institutions located in theUnited States.Surprisingly, IRS Unhappy With $13 Million AllocationThe IRS gets $13 million under an appropriation bill signed by the Presidentand is not terribly thrilled with it.  The problem is that the money isearmarked for a program that would use legal firms and private collectionagencies to collect unpaid taxes.In a letter sent to Sen.  David Pryor (D., Ark), Margaret Milner Richardson,the IRS Commissioner, said that she had "concern" regarding the language inthe appropriations bill that would mandate the Service to spend $13 million"to initiate a program to utilize private counsel law firms and debtcollection activities."She added that she had "grave reservations" about using private contractors tocontact taxpayers on their delinquent tax debts without Congress having athorough understanding of the costs, benefits and risks of embarking on such acourse.Questions aboundIn her letter, Ms.  Richardson set forth a number of areas to be consideredsuch as the impact private debt collectors would have on the public'sperception of the fairness of tax administration and the security of thefinancial information provided to the IRS.She also expressed concern about how taxpayers' rights would be protected andtheir privacy guaranteed as well as whether privatizing collection of tax debtwas really a good business decision for the federal government.  She cited thefact that presently the IRS telephone collection efforts yield about $26 forevery dollar expended compared with more complex and difficult cases thatyield only $10 for every dollar spent.  Accordingly, she doubts whetherprivate collectors will be able to obtain the same successful return as theIRS.The matter is still up in the air because Sen.  Pryor (a key opponent of thebill) isn't entirely clear on whether the IRS will be required to spend themoney.  Right now the Service is studying how best to proceed.Updated Electronic Filing Procedures for 1996The IRS has issued Rev.  Proc.  95-49 setting forth the various requirementsfor electronic filing for the 1996 tax season for those who participate in theprogram with respect to Form 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ.  It updates andsupersedes Rev.  Proc.  94-63.  The effective date was Nov.  22, 1995.Under the new changes, the Service noted that Form 1040, 1040A and 1040EZcannot be electronically filed after Oct.  15, 1996, even if the taxpayer hasbeen granted an extension to file a return beyond that date.  It also pointedout that an amended tax return cannot be electronically filed nor can returnswith foreign addresses or those for a decedent.Furthermore, the new Rev.  Proc.  details the procedures that applicants mustfollow to be accepted into the electronic filing program including theirresponsibilities, the penalties that could be applied, advertising standardsand administrative reviews, to name a few.With respect to such applicants, the procedure makes it easier for a certifiedpublic accountant to be accepted into the program by dispensing with thesubmission of a fingerprint card along with the application and requiringinstead evidence of the individual's professional status.The Latest IRS Audit Techniques GuidesThe IRS keeps pumping them out.  The Market Segment Specialization Program(MSSP) audit techniques guides help IRS examiners focus on the significantissues in a particular industry or class of taxpayers.  According to theService, they are designed to make audits more efficient and to ensure theuniform application of tax laws.  Here is what's in the three latest guides:Beauty and barber shops.  The IRS noted that the salon industry is cashintensive, that the majority of the work force had a high school education andwere graduates of a cosmetology school.  The Service often found that thebooks and records provided were rather limited and that the examiner wouldhave to conduct a very good initial review by utilizing various questions inorder to determine income.  The guide contains more than 50 potentialquestions.The IRS said that additional considerations were in reconciling the reportedtax return income to the taxpayer's financial status, evaluating the intensivecash situation to determine the extent of the income probe and designing atest to determine income from a reported or known reliable variable directlyrelated to that income.The Service emphasized that an important examination step, of course, was tocompare the type of services and the number of appointments to the amount ofincome reported.  It provided specific audit techniques to the industry thatcan be used including how to calculate unreported tips.Auto body and repair industry.  The almost 100-page guide explained that mostauto body shops were small to medium sized businesses operated as soleproprietorships, small partnerships or closely held corporations and theyranged in size from the corner shop to large franchises with many locations.It pointed out that body shops were particularly interesting because theycombined a service-type business with retailing aspects.The IRS noted that although they provide labor and skill, they must alsopurchase and resell the needed parts.  Accordingly, this, they maintained,often created conflicts in determining whether shops were required to maintaininventories.The guide stated that the industry was extremely competitive as a result ofthe influence that insurance companies exerted and inasmuch as insurance paidfor many claims, they looked for the most cost-efficient businesses.  Thus, ashop that was willing to use less expensive parts as opposed to factoryoriginals would be preferred.The Service called attention to the fact that because inventory adjustmentshad been consistently made in the auto body-repair industry, the examinerwould find it necessary to become acquainted with procedures for making achange in the accounting method.  For example, for a taxpayer on the accrualbasis, the change will be limited to the inventory itself.  For a cash basistaxpayer, the change will include the sales and purchases.Also, the Service pointed out that with the advent of Rev.  Proc.  92-20, theexaminer needed to consider the possibility of allowing the taxpayer to spreadthe adjustment over several years.The guide contains 26 sample questions that may be used in the initialinterview, pointing out what would indicate an underreporting of income aswell as specific audit tips and special employment tax issues that mighteasily arise.Reforestation industry.  The comprehensive report was the work of a team fromExamination Collection and the State of Oregon Revenue Department.  Theirbasic goals were to determine if compliance was a problem in this industry, ifthe contractors were filing all required federal and state returns, if thereturns were substantially correct and then to make recommendations to theproper governmental agencies in order to strengthen voluntary compliancewithin the industry.The IRS said a major concern was that many transactions between contractorswas done with cash, thereby creating little or no audit trail.  Those paymentsalso reduced the likelihood that a Form 1099 was filed or that the contractorseven deposited the cash into their business accounts.  The Service noted thata possible indicator of unreported income could be illustrated by thecontractor who produced receipts for business expenses paid in cash but notpreviously deducted on the return.A detailed guideline for interviewing contractors along with suggestedquestions is included.Time for Action Regs ProposedIn proposed rulemaking IA-36-91, the IRS has issued a document that containsproposed regs relating to the time for performance of acts by taxpayers and bythe Commissioner, a district director, or the director of a regional servicecenter, where the last day for performance falls on a Saturday, Sunday orlegal holiday.  In particular, the proposed regs would remove the list oflegal holidays and other outdated material.The list of holidays would be replaced by citations to the law (legal holidaysin the District of Columbia is found in D.C.  Code Ann.  28-2701) from whichthe holidays would be discerned.  In this way, said the IRS, future changes inthe law regarding holidays would not require amendments to the regs.Practicing Before the IRS Doesn't Get Any EasierThe Office of Director of Practices has outlined four specific scenarios thatillustrate the types of conduct that would warrant disciplinary action onthose who practice before the IRS.Coming under Circular 230, the Service said that these represent composites ofmatters coming to the director's office and do not constitute precedent in anyone matter.  They are as follows:* Practitioner A makes estimated tax payments exceeding his personal taxliability but doesn't file corresponding income tax returns.  He gives theexcuse that he had no time because of a busy schedule.  He could get suspendedor disbarred.* Practitioner B represents a client whose return has been selected for audit.The practitioner calls the revenue agent who will be conducting the audit buthe is unavailable.  They go back and forth, each missing the other's call.Finally, Practitioner B telephones claiming it's a medical emergency,whereupon the alarmed agent takes the call.  The practitioner's actionconstitutes what is called "disreputable conduct."* Practitioner C cancels conferences with an appeals officer on five differentoccasions leaving messages on his answering machine that he had schedulingproblems.  Conduct constitutes "unreasonable delay" and could warrantsuspension or disbarrment.* Practitioner D pleads guilty to making false statements in obtainingfederally insured mortgage and winds up with a felony conviction.  Thedirector can impose a suspension on the practitioner based on dishonesty.IRS Briefs* Mediation to resolve Tax Court cases.  In a memorandum to fieldadministrative officers, the IRS has outlined a procedure for the use ofmediation to resolve certain docketed Tax Court cases.  Any agreement reachedthrough mediation would then be submitted to the court as a stipulation ofsettled issues.* Appointments to international posts.  The IRS has appointed John Lyons toassistant commissioner, Thomas Smith to deputy assistant commissioner andMichael Danilack III to associate chief counsel, all in the internationalarea.* Federal-State reference guide.  The IRS has issued a special guide book forstate and local government employers that contains information on SocialSecurity and Medicare coverage and employer-tax-withholding requirements asthey pertain to government employees.

How aboutopening a small consulting firm where your client base comes from what youwrite?  Write?The accountant with the proclivity for reducing thoughts to the printed pageis Jack P.  Friedman, a transplanted New Yorker now living in Dallas, who overthe years has written and published 21 books and more than 200 articles.Along the way, he has also accumulated an extraordinary string of degrees anddesignations including CPA, Ph.D., MBA, BBA, MAI, SREA, ASA and CRE, to name afew.  In effect, what Friedman has done is build first a foundation based onhis unique experience and interest and then construct an accounting practicefrom there.He is primarily a consultant in matters concerning real estate but also insome areas that have a more general business orientation.  Friedman noted thatmuch of his current work is in litigation support, for several reasons."First, attorneys prefer a published author as an expert witness.  Publicationof a book or professional article lends credibility.  Second, litigationsupport offers a fairly high hourly compensation rate.  Also, the mix ofassignments that I receive in litigation support present challenges andprevent boredom."Writings=Client ListFriedman's books are extensive ranging from consumer guides to graduate schooltextbooks and professional references.  They include The Dictionary of TaxTerms (Barron's),The Encyclopedia of Investments (Warren, Gorham & Lamont),Income Property Appraisal and Analysis (Prentice-Hall) and Keys to Investingin Real Estate (Barron's).His client list includes Champion International Corporation, the City ofDallas, Simon Property Group, Exxon and the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation.Where does he get his clients?  They generally come to him because of what hehas written.  For example, a law firm in Kentucky involved in the condemnationof a public utility found themselves faced with three appraisals from thecondemnee relating to the market value of the property.  The firm sent foreducational materials of professional appraisal associations, found Friedman'sname and credits and called him to review the appraisals.  He did and said hefound them deficient.  "Based on my testimony at the hearings," he pointedout, "the trial judge precluded any of the appraisal testimony from the otherside.  I have since assisted the firm in other matters."Friedman also related the story of a prominent real estate broker in Dallaswho was interested in selling her own firm.  "It was a substantial business,"he said, "with a unique market niche."  The broker visited his accountant togain an understanding of the ramifications of the sale and to enlist theaccountant as an ally in marketing the business.  The accountant researchedthe business literature on the sale of a real estate brokerage firm, cameacross Friedman's name as having prepared articles and monographs on thesubject and then brought him in to counsel the owner."All discussions," noted Friedman, "had to be absolutely confidential becauseleaks of a possible sale could cause injury to the firm's value."  The firmwas sold in less than two months at a price and on terms suggested byFriedman.Project orientation.  Friedman believes that his course of practice issomething that can be done without the ongoing burden of a bigger professionalstaff.  In fact, he keeps a lid on having a lot of people running around hisoffice.  He works primarily with one full-time administrative assistant andthree part-time people, all of whom have extensive experience in real estateaccounting, appraisal analysis and investment analysis.The firm's personnel philosophy is to have relationships with others as stafffor potential assignments, but not to take on the obligations or overhead offull-time staff.  "Therfore," he pointed out, "people with various specialtiesmay be brought in to work on a complex project, on an as-needed basis."  Hesaid that this modus operandi provides greater freedom and flexibility.Getting Into PrintFriedman noted that his first five articles grew out of the work he was doingas a CPA, which was in helping a real estate developer package FHA 236 housingprojects for sale to investors as a tax shelter.  Most of his subsequentarticles have been in response to a current business problem or have grown outof research needed to shed light on a particular issue.What does it take to get things written and published?  Friedman offered thesetips:* Write what you are most interested in.  * Start with an article 10 to 40double-spaced typewritten pages.  Don't begin by tackling a full-length bookproject.  * Prepare an outline.  That will provide a path to follow and moreimportantly will allow you to work on it over a period of time-in free momentsbetween what should be more pressing activities.  * Send it in even if theeditor declines interest in the topic.  The editor may like it when he or shesees it.Friedman also offered a tip on manuscript preparation.He points out that almost all the publishers will edit the manuscript, somemore than others.  "Still, although editors can make a silk purse out of asow's ear, they're more likely to decline an obviously substandard piece (suchas one that is replete with typos), so seek out a typist who can prepare apresentable manuscript."  In fact, Friedman goes a step further and insiststhat you proofread your manuscript carefully before submission because "eventhe best typist may have misunderstood you."He said that even if you can't find a publisher, "a well-thought out,beautifully typed and printed manuscript can be used in your own firm'spromotional material."Friedman emphasized the fact that "manuscripts don't write themselves.  Ittakes real work."  Also, you must be realistic.  "Don't expect immediateresults.  The payoff after publishing may take months or years."  To him, it'spaid off not only in accounting fees but in book royalties, as well.He believes that there are many benefits to publishing.  "It brings prestigeto your employer or client and highlights you as an expert on a subject,making your name valuable both inside and outside your firm."Friedman's writings corroborate this and prove the point that putting the pento the paper can pay off handsomely.Jack P.

In determining its estate tax liability, the estate firstdetermined the fair market value of her interest and then subtracted a 30%discount of $819,000 to reflect lack of marketability and control.  The estatethen determined the special use valuation of that interest.The estate's pro-rata share of the special use valuation was more than$750,000 less than the discounted fair market value.  As a result, the estatethen reported the discounted fair market value less an additional $750,000 forthe interest in the partnership under the special use valuation election.The IRS argued, and the Tax Court agreed, that the fair market value of theinterest for this purpose should not have been reduced by the 30% discountsince the estate was also taking the $750,000 special use valuation reduction.Law:  Under Section 2032A, an election can be made for estate tax purposes tovalue property according to its qualified use rather than at its highest orbest use.  But the maximum reduction in valuation is $750,000.  By Section2032A(g), the election applies to interests held in a partnership.  In Estateof Maddox, the Tax Court did not permit a subtraction for a minority interestdiscount against the special use valuation itself.Held:  For the estate.  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held thatthe true fair market value for Section 2032A purposes is not modified in anyway and so it was proper to subtract the discount.  Neither the statute northe legislative history suggest that Section 2032A is designed to modify thedefinition of fair market value.  An accurate determination of fair marketvalue must involve the use of the minority interest discount.The special usevaluation reduction of $750,000 can then be applied.  Estate of Hoover, 76AFTR 2d 95-7305, (CA-10, 1995).PROCEDURETransferee Bound by Transferor's Closing AgreementHarvey Pert is married to Kathleen Pert who was previously married to TimothyRiffe.  For four tax years, Kathleen, as representative of Riffe's estate andin her own behalf signed closing agreements to settle tax liabilities assertedagainst her and Riffe and penalties asserted against Riffe.  She also agreedto a stipulated decision of the Tax Court to settle liability for another taxyear.The IRS asserted transferee liability against Harvey Pert as both transfereeof Kathleen and successor transferee of Riffe.  Harvey claimed that he couldlitigate the underlying tax deficiencies despite the signed closingagreements.Law:  Section 7121 authorizes written closing agreements which cannot bereopened unless there is a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentationof material fact.  It also says that a closing agreement may not be annulled,modified, set aside or disregarded in any suit, action or proceeding.Held:  For the IRS.  Pert could not relitigate any of the liabilities thatKathleen settled in the closing agreements or the stipulated decision.  Aclosing agreement binds a transferee of the party to the closing agreement ina manner analagous to the way res judicata binds a transferee to a priorjudicial decision in which the transferor was the party.  Also, there is nobasis for distinguishing between a transferee and a successor transferee forthis purpose.Res judicata, under which parties and their privies to a prior action thatconcluded with a final decision on the merits, are bound as to all issues thatwere or might have been decided in the prior action, also applies to personsin privity with the taxpayer (e.g., as a transferee and transferor).Thus, res judicata bars a transferee from relitigating the income taxliabilities of a transferor once a final decision has been entered by the TaxCourt in the transferor's case if the decision was stipulated.The Tax Court refused in this case to reconsider the principle that a TaxCourt decision entered pursuant to the stipulation of the parties isconsidered to be judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata.

Another way is touse tax and accounting programs available from the same vendor, so that thedifferent programs all speak the same language.  A third way is to use athird-party bridge product that provides data conversion between differentsoftware programs.For example, the Audisys Corp.  of Portland, Ore., said its TAXi tax importbridge is capable of transferring data from virtually any accountingapplication into several popular tax return software programs, including CCHProSystem fx, Lacerte, Pencil Pushers, CLR Fast/Tax and TenKey's Tax ShopEntities.  It said TAXi is set up to automatically convert data from severalaccounting and write-up packages, including ACCPAC Plus, ATB, CreativeSolutions ws-2, TAASC Easy ACCT and UniLink Write Up Plus.  And because it'scapable of reading DOS and ASCII formats, TAXi can convert data, thoughprobably at a slower pace, from other packages as well.  TAXi has otheradvantages, too.  It can prepare reports in either a book or tax basis, itmaintains and updates tax code dictionaries in accounting software and itenables users to switch from an accrual to a cash basis accounting method.To be sure, Audisys has its work cut out for it.  "Data conversion has its ownset of problems ...  there's always something missing," said James Metzler, afrequent lecturer in computer technology and a partner of the Buffalo,N.Y.-based accounting firm Gaines Emhoff Metzler & Kriner.Indeed, CCH and TAASC, two of the vendors whose tax software can receive datavia TAXi, say they are not directly cooperating with Audisys and recommendtheir own bridges to users.TAXi's ability to maneuver quickly also raises some questions.  Pencil PushersCEO Harvey Stein, who said he supports Audisys's efforts, said, however, thatthe time and effort it takes to code each account being converted with TAXiseems to negate the advantage of using it.But others say TAXi is the only vehicle available that enables users tointegrate virtually any tax, accounting and writeup packages of their choice -even from among competitors.  "It allows the user to make the choice of whomthey want to bridge with," said Greg King, vice president of marketing forLacerte Software, adding that TAXi "breaks down some walls set up by competingvendors."Even though Lacerte has its own bridges with certain accounting and writeupvendors, King said it supports TAXi as a way to give users complete freedom indesigning their own connections.  He added that TAXi's critics overlook thefact that, after its initial set-up of codes, it requires only typicalmaintenance to update data.TAXi's price is an initial $279 with a $129 renewal cost.-Paul DemeryNew Electronic AccountantThe Winter 1995 issue of The Electronic Accountant, recently released,features multi-media offerings developed by its new Editor in Chief, LaurenceK.

Unfortunately, in thecase of transfers of closely held businesses, the owner of these businessesand the IRS don't always see eye-to-eye.  Over the years, the IRS has beenenmeshed in many battles over the valuation of minority interests in closelyheld businesses.  In 1993, the IRS appeared to have given up when it issuedRev.  Rul.  93-12, which allowed minority discounts for a parent's gifts of a20% interest in a closely held business to each of five children.  However, aclose examination of later Technical Advice Memorandums (TAMs) indicates thatthe IRS is still fighting over minority discounts.  A review of the seeds ofthis controversy makes it easier to understand the current battle lines.It's Worth Much LessBecause of the lack of market transactions, the valuation of a closely heldbusiness interest must involve a review of the corporation's intrinsic worth;which includes its earning capacity, the book value of its stock, its dividendpaying capacity and goodwill.  The IRS provided an analysis of these factorsin Rev.  Rul.  59-60.  One factor mentioned is the size of the block of stocktransferred and the block's inherent degree of control.  Although the Serviceadministratively recognizes this concept, it has repeatedly challenged thetaking of minority discounts in valuing closely held businesses for bothestate and gift tax purposes.A minority discount is based on the fact that the minority shareholder cannotunilaterally control the corporate decision making process including thepayment of dividends, the election of directors and officers and theliquidation of the corporation.  The range of the minority discount that isclaimed usually varies from about 20% to as much as 50%Generally, ownership of less than 50% of the voting stock of a closely heldcorporation will constitute a minority interest.  However, if the governingstate law requires greater than 50% of the voting stock in order to affectcorporate action, then the transferred block, if less than that greaterpercentage, will be a minority interest for discount purposes.  For minoritydiscount purposes, it is only voting control which is relevant and not thevalue of the transferred shares.Breaking It UpOwners of majority interests in closely held businesses often look to takeadvantage of the minority discount by giving stock to a number ofbeneficiaries so that each receives a minority interest.  In the case oflifetime transfers, courts have generally allowed each block to be valuedseparately.1 However, they also hold that if the transfer occurs at death,aggregation is required.2 The fact that a block of closely held stock which isincluded in the gross estate is divided among several beneficiaries isirrelevant for valuation purposes.  The imposition of the estate tax, unlikethe gift tax, is based on what the decedent owned at death and not what wasgiven to each beneficiary.On the flip side, courts have held that a transfer, either by gift or atdeath, remains a transfer of a minority interest subject to a possiblediscount even if the transferee already has control of the corporation or willachieve corporate control as a result of the transfer.3IRS Pulls BackUntil recently, it was the IRS's position that a minority discount would notbe allowed with respect to the transfer of stock among family members whenthat family controlled the corporation at the time of the transfer.In Rev.  Rul.  81-253, the Service concluded that where the family owned acontrolling interest, the stock would be valued as if all of it were held byone person.  The result was that each share transferred would be consideredpart of the controlling block.Example:  Alpha Inc.  has 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding.  Johnand Betty Smith each own 40 shares while Bob and Wendy, their two children,own 10 shares apiece.  John and Betty transfer to Bob and Wendy one share eachof their stock, which clearly is a minority interest.  However, since thefamily controlled the corporation at the time of the transfer, the IRS woulddeny the minority discount.Generally, the courts have rejected the IRS's application of familyattribution as being inconsistent with valuation principles clearly stated inthe regulations.4 According to these regs, the transferor should be viewed asa hypothetical willing seller who is independent of the other shareholders.5Rev.  Rul.  93-12 revoked Rev.  Rul.  81-253 using the example of a parent whotransferred all of the shares in a wholly owned corporation by making gifts of20% of the shares to each of his five children.  The IRS ruled that the sharesshould be valued in the hands of the donees without regard to the shares heldby other family members.The IRS has recently issued two TAMs further defining its position withrespect to this type of minority discount.  In TAM 9432001, the decedent owned48.59% of the stock with the remaining 51.41% of the stock owned by his son.Decedent's will provided that all of his stock would pass to his son.  The IRSconcluded that the minority discount would not be lost merely because the sonowned the remaining shares in the corporation.In TAM 9449001, the Service addressed the issue whether simultaneous gifts tofamily members would be valued separately.  The donor, who owned 100% of thestock in a closely held corporation, gave simultaneous gifts of the stock toeach of his 11 children.  The IRS ruled that each gift would be valuedseparately.Unfortunately, Rev.  Rul.  93-12 and the two TAMS might only be a short-termconcession.  It appears that the IRS still has an arsenal of weapons that itis using against a claim of a minority discount.Substance-Over- Form SalvoThe IRS will aggregate minority stock as components of a single control blockwhen it perceives a tax avoidance motive for the transaction.  In Estate ofMurphy,6 an individual, pursuant to a general power of appointment, controlleda 51.41% block of stock in a closely held corporation.  Eighteen days prior toher death, she transferred .88% of the stock to each of her two children,leaving her with a 49.65% interest.  The estate claimed a minority discountfor (1) the two .88% stock gifts and (2) the 49.65% block of stock owned atdeath.The Tax Court ruled that the minority discount did not apply to either.  Itconcluded that the attempt to reduce the ownership interest below 50% bygifting 1.76% of stock prior to death constituted tax avoidance.  According tothe Court, the transfer "lacked substance and economic effect."  The courtaggregated both the gift and testamentary transfer for valuation purposes.But it is clear that the IRS and the Court failed to recognize that asubstantial change did occur.  Implicit in the court's reasoning is that thedecedent retained control over the corporation until her death.  But, thisignores the legal significance of the decedent's stock transfer whicheffectively stripped her of control over the corporation.The court's conclusion would be acceptable if there was some sort of anagreement that the children were required to vote the gifted stock inaccordance with their mother's wishes.  However, no such agreement existed, sothe decedent's 49.65% stock interest should have been considered a minorityinterest.7Recently issued TAM 9504004 further shows the IRS's propensity to applysubstance over form.  In this TAM, the decedent, 19 days before he died fromterminal cancer, sold one-half of his 60% interest in the family corporationto child A, who at the time owned 20% of the corporation prior to the sale.This increased child A's interest to 50%.  The decedent's two other childrencollectively owned 20%.  Simultaneously with the sale, the corporationredeemed the decedent's remaining 30% interest.  The redemption increasedchild A's stock ownership interest to 71.4%.  The estate stipulated that theprincipal purpose of the simultaneous stock sale and redemption was totransfer decedent's controlling interest in the corporation to child A.For valuation purposes, the decedent's estate treated the sale and redemptionas involving two separate transfers.  However, the IRS concluded that forvaluation purposes the sale of decedent's 30% stock sale to Child A and thesimultaneous redemption of decedent's remaining 30% interest must be viewed asa single integrated transfer of a controlling corporate interest to child A.Swing Vote AttackA portion or all of the minority discount may be lost if the transferred stockis determined by the IRS to have a swing vote characteristic.  Minority stockis considered as having such a characteristic if it may enable anotherminority holder to achieve majority control.Example:  Two shareholders own 49% of the stock and a third shareholder owns2%.  The stock owned by the 2% shareholder is perceived as possessing a swingvote potential; it arguably may be able to command a premium in excess of itspro-rata value.The adverse effect of the transferred stock with swing vote attributes isillustrated in the following example based on TAM 9436005.Example:  John owns all of the 100 outstanding common shares of Betacorporation.  On Dec.  18, 1994, John gifted 30 shares to each of his threechildren.  He also transferred five shares to his wife.  In valuing thetransfer, John discounted the value of the transferred shares by a minoritydiscount of 25%.  According to the IRS, John would not be entitled to aminority discount for any of the three 30% blocks since each had a swing votecharacteristic.  Any of the three children could join with another and controlthe corporation.This is inconsistent with case law which recognizes that where a donor makessimultaneous gifts of stock to different donees, each gift is valuedseparately in determining the fair market value for gift tax purposes.8 TheIRS disputed donor's argument that if it had not been a simultaneous transfer,the result would have been different.Although the Service agreed that at the time of the transfer of the firstblock it would not reflect a swing vote attribute, it contended the value ofthe second 30% block transferred would reflect a swing vote characteristic.According to the IRS, the transfer of the second 30% block would also resultin an increase in the value of the first block transferred since the firstblock would belatedly acquire possible voting control in the form of swingvote.  The IRS reasoned that this increase in the value of the first blockwould constitute an indirect gift to the first block recipient at the time ofthe second transfer.  The IRS concluded that even if the transfers were madeat different times, the total value of the gifts would ultimately be the sameas if they were made simultaneously.The IRS's decision that the second transfer constituted an indirect gift seemsto stretch unduly the concept of an indirect gift.  Only the value of theproperty which passes at the time of the gift should be subject to the gifttax.  The second transfer carried out the donor's intent to transfer 30 sharesof stock to a particular donee.  It was not the donor's intent to transfervalue to another shareholder.  Furthermore, the IRS's position is built uponthe principle that any increase in the value of one family member's stockconstitutes a gift to that shareholder.  In essence, what the IRScharacterizes as an indirect gift is a phantom gift.  Consider the following:Example:  Family Inc.  has 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding whichis owned by three sisters:  Linda (46 shares), Sally (30 shares) and Betty (24shares).  Linda is bored with corporate life and decides to gift her shares toher two sisters.  It is her intent to treat her sisters equally, so she gives23 shares to each.  After the gift, Sally is in control of the corporationwith 53 shares while Betty owns 47 shares.Under established case law, Linda would be entitled to a minority discountwith respect to both transfers.  The value of Linda's gift to Sally is limitedto the value of the shares actually transferred.  There is no basis forfinding an additional indirect gift to Sally.Assume the same set of facts, except that Linda decides to have her sharesredeemed from the corporation in a transaction which does not have as itsintended purpose the objective of transferring control of the corporation toSally.  There is no question that the redemption would result in increasingthe value of Sally's shares.  However, it would be an unintended stretch ofthe gift tax rules to suggest that Linda has made a gift to Sally as a resultof the redemption.  That would only be the result if one extends the IRS'sperception of an indirect gift.  It should be noted that the courts haverejected similar attempts by the Service in the past to create phantom incomein the form of a constructive dividend to the remaining shareholders.9In support of its swing vote position the IRS primarily relies upon Estate ofWinkler.10 In that case the IRS contested the amount of the minority discountfor a decedent's 10% ownership of a corporation with two differentfamilies-the Winklers and the Simmons-each owning 45% of the stock.  The IRSdenied the minority discount for estate tax purposes claiming that the ownerof the 10% block could effect control over the corporation by joining witheither family.  According to the Tax Court in this case, a willing buyer wouldpay a premium for this 10% stock interest.The court's rationale here is inconsistent with the regulations' concept of ahypothetical willing buyer and willing seller.  It invites an unintendedsubjective and very speculative inquiry into the feelings, attitudes andanticipated behaviors of the recipients of the stock, other shareholders andpotential purchasers.The IRS's position would then result in the minority discount being eithereliminated or reduced whenever the minority block of stock being transferredwould provide control if coupled with any other minority blocks.  Except inEstate of Winkler, the courts have generally not embraced this position.  Infact, the Ninth Circuit in Propstra11 rejected such an approach and allowed aminority discount for an estate.  It reasoned that inquiries into theanticipated behavior of the surviving co-owners was logically inconsistentwith the regulations and would require subjective assessments that might proveto be groundless.  In Estate of Bright12, the Fifth Circuit did not considerthe swing vote characteristics of a 27.5% stock interest.  At the time of thetransfer, the decedent's wife owned 27.5% of the corporate stock and anunrelated party owned 30%.Query?  Is swing vote potential limited to those situations where only oneminority block shareholder could achieve control?  In TAM 9436005, theminority block which could achieve control by aligning with the transferredshares was owned by one person.  However, in TAM 9449001, the IRS implied thatminority stock could possess swing characteristics even if the benefittingminority block was owned by more than one shareholder.Section 2704 ThreatPrior to the passage of Section 2704 in 1990, family business interests wereoften structured so that voting and liquidation rights would lapse upon atransfer resulting in a reduced estate or gift tax.  Use of lapsing rightswould then result in a closely held business being valued at its going-concernvalue, which very often is less than its liquidation value.In Estate of Harrison,13 a decedent was both a general and limited partner ina family partnership in which his sons were also limited partners.  Pursuantto state law, the decedent, as general partner, possessed the power lapsing atdeath to liquidate the partnership and to receive the liquidation valueattributable to both his general and limited partnership interest.  Thelimited partners did not possess such power.  The estate valued his limitedpartnership interest at its going-concern value of $33 million instead of atits higher liquidation value of $59 million that the IRS contended.  The valueof the general partnership interest was not in dispute.  The Tax Courtconcluded that the value of the limited partnership interest was $33 millionsince the liquidation right lapsed at death.Congressional concern regarding perceived valuation abuses as a result ofusing lapses to artificially reduce transfer tax value resulted in the passageof Section 2704.  It overrules the result in Harrison by eliminating thedisappearance of value caused by a lapse in either the voting or liquidationrights (defined in Reg.  25.2704-1(b)) of the transferred interest.  It treatsthe lapse of either a voting or liquidation right as a taxable transfer if theholder of the right and members of the family (as defined in Section2704(a)(1)) control the partnership or corporation, both before and after thelapse.  The drop in value triggered by the lapse is recaptured as anadditional transfer.  The value of the transfer is equal to the excess of (1)the total interest value (including voting and liquidation rights) held beforethe lapse, over (2) the value (without the lapsed right) immediately after thelapse.Example:  John owns 70% of the outstanding common stock of Alpha corporationwhile his daughter Betty owns the remaining 30% interest.  John's voting stockis automatically converted to nonvoting stock at his death.  The pre-lapsevalue of the 70% interest, which possesses voting rights, is valued at $1million.  The post-lapse value of John's 70% interest, without voting rights,is reduced to $400,000.  The amount of the Section 2704 transfer is valued at$600,000, the difference between the value of the stock as voting andnonvoting stock.Section 2704(b) addressed similar perceived valuation abuses regardingintra-family transfers of corporation or partnership interests where the rightto liquidate is restricted.  It provides that applicable restrictions14 on theability of a corporation or partnership to liquidate are disregarded whenvaluing an interest in such entity.  Section 2704(b) applies if there is atransfer of a business interest to, or for the benefit of, the transferor'sfamily and members of the transferor's family control the entity immediatelybefore the transfer.Example:  Sally owns all of the preferred stock in Profit Corporation.  Thestock carries a right to liquidate which cannot be exercised until 1999.Sally's two children, Bob and Betty, own all of the common stock, which is theonly voting stock.  In 1994, Sally gifts the preferred stock to Bob and Betty.Under Section 2704(b), the value of the gifted stock is determined withoutregard to any restriction because it is not a restriction which by its termswill never lapse.  Because the restriction lapses subsequent to the transfer,it is disregarded.  Therefore, the Profit preferred stock is valued as thoughthe restriction on liquidation did not exist.It has been suggested that strict application of Section 2704 may preclude theapplication of the minority discount.15 Consider the following:Example:  John owns all of the 100 outstanding common stock of Betacorporation, which is the only outstanding class of stock.  On March 1, 1995,John gives 30 shares to his son, Bob, and 30 shares to his daughter, Betty.The voting rights attributed by the corporation's bylaws to such stock lapseupon the transfer.  The value of the corporation on the date of the gift was$1 million and the per-share value prior to the gift was $10,000.  Thepost-lapse value of each share of gifted stock is $7,500.  Assume that therecommended minority discount would be 25%.  Since the right to vote thetransferred shares lapses upon the stock transfer, there is a potentialSection 2704(a) transfer equal to $2,500 per share.  Thus, the per-share valuesubject to gift taxation would be $10,000 per share.  Such a result wouldeliminate the minority discount.  But for Section 2704(a), the per-share valuesubject to gift taxation would be reduced to $7,500 as a result of theminority discount.  However, Section 2704(a) creates a transfer equal to thevalue of the lapsed voting rights.Congress considered including in Section 2704 a provision that the minoritydiscount would not be allowed.  Despite the challenge, the committee reportsprovide that Section 2704 currently is not intended to affect minoritydiscounts or other discounts.  Reg.  25.2704-1(d) appears to be consistentwith this point.  According to the reg, when valuing a gifted interest with alapse, the starting point for determining the amount of the 2704 transfer isnot the value of all interests owned by the holder immediately before thetransfer.  Instead, it is the value of all such interests determinedimmediately after the lapse as if the lapsed right was nonlapsing.Example:  At his death, D owned all of the preferred stock of Alphacorporation and his child, Betty, owned all of the common stock.  Thepreferred stock possessed 60% of the total voting power with the common stockpossessing the remaining 40%.  Pursuant to the corporate bylaws, the votingrights of the preferred stock terminated on D's death.  The value of D'sinterest immediately prior to his death was $100,000.  The value of thatinterest immediately after death would have been $90,000 if the voting rightshad been nonlapsing.  The decrease in value reflects the end of D'sinvolvement in Alpha.The regulations recognize the $10,000 discount attributable to the loss of akey person.  Therefore, under Section 2704(a), the beginning value of thetransferred stock is the post-transfer value after application of the key-mandiscount.  The same analysis should also apply with respect to the minoritydiscount.  If so, then the starting point for determining the amount of theSection 2704 transfer should be the post-transfer value after application ofthe minority discount.Example:  John owns 80 shares of the total of Money Corporation's 100outstanding shares of common stock.  He gifts 40 shares to each of his twochildren.  Per the corporate bylaws, the voting rights of John's common stockterminated upon the stock transfer.  The per-share value of the transferredstock prior to the gift was $1,000 per share.  The value of that interestimmediately after the gift would have been $750 per share if the voting rightshad been nonlapsing.  The decrease in value reflects a 25% minority discount.Assume that as a result of the lapse the per-share value of the transferredstock drops to $600 per share.  If we assume that the beginning value forSection 2704(a) purposes is $750 which incorporates a 25% minority discount,the value of the 2704(a) transfer is $150 per share ($750 minority discountvalue less $600) and not $400.Final Legislative OffensiveWe understand that the IRS is pursuing a legislative attempt to eliminate theminority discount.  This would not be the first direct legislative threat tothe minority discount.  In 1987, the House version of Section 2036(c) providedthat absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the deemed value ofstock in a corporation is its pro-rata share of all the stock in the class.The Senate version of Section 2036(c) did not contain a similar provision.The House provision on minority discounts was dropped from the final Section2036(c) bill.Historically, the minority discount has played a significant role in manyestate plans.  Although the IRS has reversed its position with respect tofamily attribution in Rev.  Rul.  93-12, it has established significantpositions elsewhere to regain any perceived lost ground.  As the battlescontinues, the concern is that the IRS might ultimately win the war.  nCARL C.  RADOM, J.D., LL.M.  is a member of the Kansas City law firm of Lewis,Rice & Fingersh, L.C.MICHAEL A.

"We have to contend withthese rumours every three months," Weiershauser said.Although it is not the first time Lloyds has apparently considered thesale of its 75 percent of SMH, on this occasion various circumstancessuggest that the time is right.According to the Merrill Lynch presentation report, there are a numberof international banks which could be considering the sale of theirGerman private banking subsidiaries in the short and medium term.Germany's new regulations on capital adequacy and capital backing forderivatives business, and in particular the new rules on minimumvolumes for trading business, all place the viability of smaller Germanbanks in question, Merrill Lynch said.The additional work and expenditure necessary to tackle thesechallenges would induce many banks to seek a strong parent bank tofinance the necessary investments in edp and personnel, or else towithdraw from certain businesses.Another dilemma is that some of the exclusive and confidential serviceswhich are the hallmark of German private banks can no longer beprovided under the new legislation. German banks are now obliged, forinstance, to pass on suspicions of insider trading.But the crucial argument of Merrill Lynch's presentation was that SMHis better placed than most to tackle these difficulties. SMH isparticularly attractive to potential purchasers, according to Merrill,because of its above-average financial performance, excellent marketreputation and highly professional management team.The bank has operated its own international capital markets businessfor some years and has the expertise to comply with the new capital andtrading regulations without any real difficulty, Merrill added.Nevertheless, Lloyds will be aware that several other big banks havesuffered losses and embarrassment from their German private bankingsubsidiaries. Barclays' Merck, Finck, lost substantial sums overseveral years and humiliated its shareholders by publishing profitfigures for 1993 before having to admit that the bank had made a lossafter all.Recently it has been rumoured that Grunelius Privatbankiers, the tinyprivate bank owned by Deutsche Bank, will also be sold off or evendisbanded. In 1994, Grunelius' assets shrank by nearly 14 percent toDM206 million ($143 million). Commissions income fell whileadministrative expenses rose, culminating in a net loss of DM1.8million. Managing Director Gerd Schmitz- Morkramer left several monthsago and has not yet been replaced.But if Lloyds is indeed considering a sale of SMH, which it acquired in1984, the reasons would probably lie with its own strategy.It is telling that Lloyds, which has never been a major internationalinvestment house, has always operated SMH at arm's length as anon-consolidated subsidiary. But Lloyds has recently amended itsstrategy and foreign capital markets subsidiaries no longer seem to fitin at all.Lloyds is now aiming to focus on the mass market at home and hopes tobecome the strongest and most profitable institution in UK retailbanking. The recent merger with the TSB retail bank followed takeoversof the Cheltenham & Gloucester building society and the insurer AbbeyLife. Rather than retaining SMH which is engaged primarily in upscaleGerman private banking and capital markets business - Lloyds could selland use the proceeds of sale to pursue its new strategic aims.In the light of Lloyds' new strategy, it is clear that the profitableshareholding in SMH which could be divested to another large financialinstitution without stiffening competition in Lloyds' core UK market.Traditionally, Lloyds has included in its core business any subsidiarywhich generates return on equity of at least 15 percent. SMH achievednet return on equity of more than 27 percent in 1993, but slipped backto 3.3 percent the following year as a result of depleted commissionsincome. Weiershauser indicated that commissions income had made a"respectable" showing in 1995, but declined to give details.However, the sale - if it does happen - may not occur for months.Lloyds' profits are so good - indeed, the bank is considering a sharebuy-back - that it need not accede to the first bidder. If it doessell, Lloyds can almost certainly afford to wait until an advantageousprice is offered.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONSPRIVATE BANKING is one of the most troublesome terms in the financialservices lexicon. Consider the number of definitions.Ask a mainland European to define the term and, in all probability, aprivate bank will be described as a banking institution not owned bythe government. Probe a little harder, especially in Switzerland, andthe respondent may qualify his answer by pointing out that a privatebank tends not to be incorporated, is structured on the partnershipmodel, and is totally reliant on the partners' resources for bankcapital.Go to the UK or the US and a more familiar definition will be given.Private banking is concerned with the provision of banking services forhigh net worth individuals. However, as innumerable articles in PBIhave pointed out over the years, this definition is not without itsdrawbacks.The first problem is that no one has yet come up with a definitivedescription of "high net worth". To judge from the plethora of "privatebanks" coming into existence, the high net worth threshold is fallingby the day. It will surely not be long before the whole of the retailbanking sector will be subsumed by the private banking market.A second problem is that most of the services provided by "privatebanks" are not concerned with banking, i.e. the collection of deposits,the making of loans and the provision of payment services. Assetmanagement, tax planning and the establishment and administration oftrusts, inter alia, are the essence of private banking, or moreaccurately, of wealth management.Although the possession of a banking licence can be advantageous in anumber of respects - it facilitates offshore and international "privatebanking" as well as providing an aura of greater security - it is notcritical to the business of wealth management.In fact "private banks" are probably responsible for only a smallproportion of the total stock of wealth owned by "high net worth"individuals, although it is likely that they dominate the internationaland offshore markets.This poses a considerable dilemma for the editor of PBI. It may bepossible to identify a discrete target market in terms of wealthmanagement institutions that possess a banking licence. The problem isthat they constitute a small sector of the market within which privatebanks compete.Clearly a way around this impasse is to redefine "private banking".Henceforth, as far as PBI is concerned, private banking will be definedas "the provision of financial services and wealth managementfacilities for affluent customers".ONE CONSEQUENCE of this definition is that the scope and content of PBIwill be extended. From time to time previous editors have dabbled withother institutions active in the wealth management sector such as legaland accountancy firms, broker dealers and the plethora of institutionscontained within the "independent financial adviser" umbrella. Althoughwe do not intend to cut back our coverage of institutions active in theinternational private banking sector - indeed we intend to expand boththe depth and breadth of our coverage - the "non-bank" private banks orwealth management institutions will assume a higher profile.This is at it should be. Last year a study produced by PSI of TampaFlorida showed conclusively that US banks were losing market share inthe private banking sector to broker-dealers. The losses were notconfined to "middle-income affluent", a market segment which might beconsidered particularly vulnerable. Perhaps, more worryingly, theyincluded the "elite private banking" segment, or clients who had onaverage $1.2 million of investible assets and who contributed over$10,000 in annual revenue.The dynamism exhibited by non-bank sectors of the wealth managementsector makes it a natural for coverage in PBI. In the US, for example,the investment companies and broker dealers are having a profoundeffect on the evolution of the financial services sector. They haveoften been a hothouse of new product developments, many of which can beusefully taken up by "conventional" private banks.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Not onlydid funds managed by its members double during 1995 but there has beena substantial increase in the number of firms active in the sector.It is no surprise to find that the firm with the biggest involvement isan Edinburgh-based firm, Murray Beith & Murray, which has #180 million($280 million) under management. Many of the firms currently active inthe Scottish fund management sector can trace their origins to thelegal and accountancy professions. This is especially the case withBaille Gifford, Scotland's largest specialist fund manager. For therecord it still maintains a partnership structure.There are two sets of factors responsible for the increased involvementof solicitors in the wealth management sector. Like retail banks, theyhave seen margins on their traditional business areas tumble as aconsequence of new entrants and increased competition. On the otherhand, they already had some of the core capabilities required forsuccessful involvement in the sector. They appear to be more thanwilling to buy in what they lack.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The trend marks a sharp reversal from the 1980s, when investmentbanks dominated Wall Street earnings by posting profits that were morethan twice those reported by "full-line" brokerage firms catering toindividual investors.In 1994, which saw a global correction in the bond market, WallStreet's investment banks were thrown for a loss, while the full-linebrokerages remained firmly in the black. And in 1995, a stockmarketrally pushed the brokers' earnings some 60 percent over those ofinvestment banks (see chart)."The securities industry has been turned upside down," said SIAresearch chief Jeffrey Schaefer. In the 1990s, he explained, profitsgrew due to three factors: the success of capital raising activities;the booming business of money management both for institutions andindividuals; and the phenomenal growth of mutual funds. While the firstfactor has helped investment banks, full-line brokerage houses havetaken advantage of all three factors, with retail investment servicesgiving them a strong edge."The biggest difference [from the 1980s] has been the role of mutualfunds, which I call the financial intermediary of the 1990s," Schaeferexplained."Long-term mutual funds, which only became attractive toindividuals in fixed-income markets in 1985, have allowed individualsto participate in the equity and bond markets of the 1990s and still beable to diversify."The performance of full-line brokers in 1995 is particularly impressivegiven the strong performance of investment banks, due to last year'smerger and acquisition boom and the surging revenues from the issuingof securities. Investment banks have also benefited from 1995's bondrally, which has greatly enhanced the value of their large bondportfolios. Investment banks' fees from underwriting new stocks andbonds have recently begun contributing from their bottom lines again.In 1995, full-line brokerage firms have benefited far more from theyear's record stockmarket trading volume and price appreciation.Excluding new stock issues, market activity has increased the value ofstocks by $2.1 trillion, or 33 percent, to a total of $8.4 trillion.Last year was one of only three in the past 21 years when stock pricesincreased more than 30 percent.Brokers have also been better positioned to exploit the explosion ofstock mutual funds, which are far more profitable for retail brokeragesthan bond funds. In 1995, an astonishing 87 percent of net cash flowinto long-term mutual funds went into equity instruments, according tothe SIA.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

His resignation from Chasecame two months before the scheduled closing of the bank's merger withChemical Banking, which will create the largest US commercial bank. Inthe competition to fill the position of the new Chase's chief cardsexecutive, Ward was edged out by his opposite number at Chemical,Charles Walsh.A 27-year veteran at Chase Manhattan, Ward served in the 1970s as thebank's credit and marketing officer for Japan and then Chase's chief oftrade and export finance in Europe and the Middle East.In 1987, he was named credit policy officer of Chase's Individual Bankbased in New York, and became president of Chase Personal FinancialServices in 1991.At Amex Bank, Ward will replace Steven Goldstein, who informed Amexofficials of his desire to resign when discussions concerning apossible sale of Amex Bank were concluded in October.American Express had tried to sell its international private bank, anEdge Act institution chartered only for offshore operations, for $1billion, or 1.25 times book value. The bank has performed poorly inrecent years, reporting a return on assets of 0.58 percent on assets of$13.39 billion in 1994.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

He hopes to attract between30,000 and 40,000 customers within four to five years.This is the first time that German retail investors have been offeredSwiss investment products by direct marketing routes. The marketingcampaign has begun with large full-colour advertisements in the Germanbusiness press, and, from next month, will branch out into direct mailaimed at high-income private investors - particularly those deemed tohave an interest in Switzerland as vacationers or owners of holidayhomes.In most markets, an advertising campaign of this kind would beunremarkable. But in Germany, Credit Suisse's advertisements arereminiscent of the mood three years ago, when the German banks madefrenzied appeals to investors to avoid tax by transferring theirsavings to accounts in Luxembourg. Some banks, particularly DresdnerBank, are still being "punished" for this, with regular police raidsand confiscation of confidential client records in branches suspectedof assisting tax evaders.Lacher is resigned to criticism from competitor banks and the Germanauthorities. But he points out that the Credit Suisse advertisementsavoid the innuendo employed by some German banks during the Luxembourgcampaigns. Indeed, Lacher is playing so safe at present that thecurrent campaign does not even stress the advantages of the Swiss francas a reserve currency. However, the next set of ads may do, he said.Moreover potential tax evaders will not be given any new opportunitiesby CS Direct Invest. In fact, since the transfers will not be made inperson (often the case with Luxembourg accounts in 1993) investors haveless chance to evade tax.Investments in the funds from German clients are transferred first toCredit Suisse's Frankfurt offices, and then en masse to Switzerland.Foreign money transfers of more than DM2,000 ($1,400) must beregistered with the local branch of the Bundesbank, and the names ofeach investor must be supplied on request. "These transfers leavefootprints in Germany," Lacher said.Customers have an incentive to use this automated route because CreditSuisse waives the usual bank fees for foreign payment transfers.Nevertheless, Lacher concedes that "the border region is a problem".Germans living near Zurich, Basel or Schaffhausen prefer to drive intoSwitzerland with cash in a briefcase and deposit it in a Swiss custodyaccount. By that means, they can escape the attention of theBundesbank, and, possibly, the German tax authorities too.CS Direct Invest was launched in Switzerland last May and has attracted25,000 enquiries. The bank declines to say how many have so far becomeCS customers.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The proposal,which has attracted the anxious attentions of federal banking and taxauthorities, is now being actively studied by Montana regulators.While the proposal appears far-fetched at first sight, Montanaauthorities said it could lead to the establishment of an innovativeoffshore deposit facility in the mountain state.In late 1995, Robert Svoboda, a former banker and Montana resident nowliving in Santa Barbara, asked Montana regulators to commission afeasibility study to investigate the possibility of establishing aSwiss-style secret banking facility in the state. Such a bank would bestate-chartered, and would not benefit from federal deposit insuranceand the federal regulation that goes along with it.The unit would provide highly confidential deposit services toforeigners through the use of numbered accounts. Svoboda's mostaggressive scenario would allow non-resident aliens to deposit funds ina Montana bank, which could then put the funds in trusts that coulddeposit the money in non-taxable investments or transfer them to otherbanks and countries. Depending on clients' investment and depositneeds, the bank could provide varying "levels of privacy.""This isn't for money-laundering or helping people to keep from payingtaxes," Svoboda told American Banker in December. "It's a safe havenfor money, and it's private."According to state authorities, Svoboda described his initialmotivation as "philanthropic" - secret banking facilities could providehis former home state with significant revenue in state-levied fees onassets and possibly escheatment revenues, where funds in secretaccounts might revert to the state treasury if they are not claimed byheirs of deceased depositors.Such an institution might also benefit from Montana's relativelyunregulated financial environment and the Montana state constitution'sunusual privacy provisions.Responding to Svoboda's proposal, Montana's legislature formed aninterim committee late last year to study the idea. The committee hasmet four times and will meet next in late January, when it will hearpresentations from federal authorities, including representatives ofthe Internal Revenue Service, the Department of the Treasury and theFederal Reserve Bank."No precedent exists for this anywhere in the country," said ChrisOlson, Montana's deputy banking commissioner, who freely admits thatstate banking authorities currently lack the legal and regulatorybackground to evaluate such a novel plan. Outside the state, bankingexperts have greeted the Svoboda proposal with incredulity or derisivelaughter."The people who haven't laughed are the Feds," said Steven Maly, alegislative aide who is co-ordinating the state legislature's interimresearch effort. "Knowing that we do a lot of fishing up here, the Fedshave warned us that we would be bottom-fishing attracting the worstcriminal element - with this sort of activity."Maly said he was surprised by the level of concern expressed by federalauthorities. "Without saying as much, they seemed to be telling us,`This could happen, and we're not going to help you do it.'"Disregarding the wrath of the Feds, Maly believes a Montana secretbanking facility is simply not practical, given existing US law andregulation. For example, he sees no way to circumvent the federalrequirement that all deposits in excess of $10,000 must be reported tothe US Treasury Department.But Maly is evaluating the possibility of minimizing federalsupervision of a state-chartered depository for offshore funds whichhave no tax liability and which waive the requirements for federaldeposit insurance.A state-chartered foreign funds depository might provide offshoreclients a higher degree of privacy than other US banks, and it mightprovide some non-taxable investment services as well. In particular, asignificant level of federal oversight could be avoided where funds aredeposited but not transferred out of the depository."We're thinking about something that is much simpler and more primitivethan a secret banking facility," Maly explained."We're not planning tocompete with existing offshore facilities. Instead, we're looking atcreating a new and different way of attracting legitimate flightcapital. One angle we're looking at is tying deposits to preciousmetals, especially platinum, which is produced in Montana."The cost advantages of in-state production and storage of preciousmetals, coupled with new financial technology and reduced regulation,could create a commercial opportunity to establish a new kind ofoffshore depository in Montana, Maly said.He believes that such a facility might be attractive to rich familiesin Taiwan, for example, who are looking for secure and relativelysecret international deposit facilities, and who already hold asignificant amount of their wealth in precious metals.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The OCC's letter comes more than a year afterCongress passed the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and BranchingEfficiency Act, which ushered in a new era for national banking in theUS.The OCC's action aims to "level the playing field" for US banks wishingto extend their trust business to states where they have no trustcharters. According to the OCC, trust banks can now ignore state lawsrequiring them to have operations based in those states. Moreover,national banks need not apply for special permits if state-charteredbanks are exempt from them.Banks have long complained that state regulatory requirements, whichgenerally stipulate that trust departments must have in-stateheadquarters to obtain special exemptions, have contributed toinefficiency by preventing consolidations. However, the OCC's ruling islikely to face resistance from state regulators uncomfortable withfurther intrusions from federal banking authorities.The OCC's letter came in response to an inquiry from Midwestsuper-regional Banc One, which is eager to centralise its 11-statetrust business under a single national banking charter.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Trust departments must also report instances wheresurcharges or the cost of settling customer disputes have caused anaccount to lose more than $100,000.Up until now, trust departments have reported only the size ofdiscretionary and non-discretionary assets by account type. The newrule applies to 2,819 trust departments that manage more than $100million in assets. These units control 99 percent of the over $11trillion held in trust at US financial institutions.The new regulation was drafted by the Federal Financial InstitutionsExaminations Council, an inter-agency group of federal regulators thatsupervises federally insured depository institutions.The rule will permit examiners to produce uniform measurements of theperformance and risk management policies of trust departments, and toget a fuller picture of their solvency and profitability.Regulators have called for new scrutiny of the US trust industry, asthe gathering and managing of trust assets has gained momentum inrecent years. In the five years ending in 1993, US trust assets grew 61percent to $10.6 trillion.The American Bankers Association in Washington has protested againstthe new regulation as a violation of confidentiality. Bankers areconcerned that the information may be used to gauge the profitabilityof competitors, and that such information may become public as theresult of litigation, as happened recently in a suit filed against thederivatives activity of Bankers Trust.Regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank have responded that theprofitability information it collects on trust departments will remainconfidential, although the central bank will release compositeprofitability data which will be of use to the industry.Bankers have responded that little benefit will come from such data, asprofitability benchmarking services are already offered by privateconsultants. The Financial Services Association of Niles, Michigan, forexample, currently sells a service called Trust Compare, which allowstrust departments to benchmark their profitability against that ofother institutions using the service.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Banco Popularrecently ended the collaboration agreement on the grounds that therewas too much competition between the two institutions."After six months in operation we came to the conclusion that for abank such as ours, well positioned in the domestic market and with asubstantial branch network there were few advantages to be gained fromsuch an agreement. We realised that basically all we were doing waspresenting our clients to Bankers Trust. As a result, we decided to endthe agreement," Fernando de Soto of Banco Popular told PBI.Last year Banco Popular chose to develop its private banking servicesin close collaboration with Bankers Trust, as a means of giving aninternational dimension to its existing service and product offer. Eachbank opened its own specialised private banking branch in Madrid.Bankers Trust was to be responsible for managing client assets but eachbank had separate relationship managers and was responsible formarketing its services. For Bankers Trust, whose presence in Spain hasbeen mainly geared towards foreign customers, the agreement with BancoPopular was seen as a means of drawing closer to the domestic market.Banco Popular is adamant that competition was the only motive forending the relationship, but with its reputation for tight risk controland prudent investment practices, Banco Popular can hardly have beenpleased by Bankers Trust's loss of prestige.The US bank's reputation has taken a severe battering over the last 18months as a consequence of its derivative-related activities and thelawsuits brought against it by disgruntled clients such as Proctor &Gamble.In the meantime, Banco Popular will continue to deal with its high networth clients through the branch network."This system worked very wellin the past and there is no reason why it shouldn't continue to do so,"said de Soto.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Australianworkers had to work a day longer. It took US workers another six daysto work off their annual tax load.Onerous as these requirements were, however, they were much lower thanthose faced by Europeans, especially members of the European Union. TaxFreedom Day would have arrived in the European Union on June 14, orafter 165 days, compared with June 7 or 158 days for the OECD.Some European countries fared relatively well. In Portugal a workerwould "only" have had to work for 132 days or until May 11 to meet hisor her tax obligations. In the UK the equivalent date was May 17 or 138days.Conversely, however, Scandinavian workers would have had to work wellinto the second half of the year to clear their tax obligations.Norwegians and Finns would have had to work for 185 days, Danes 200 andSwedes 208 - or until July 27 - to achieve tax freedom.As always, with any international comparison, there are considerablemethodological problems and, as a consequence, the tax freedom dayscalculated for each country are not necessarily a"true" reflection ofthe time needed to work-off the annual tax obligation.To some extent they reflect the methodology used by Gabriel Stein, thereport's author. As such, the figures give only a rough approximationof where Tax Freedom Day might occur in each country.For each country shown in the chart, total tax revenue as a percentageof GDP at market prices has been compared to the equivalent UK figures.The difference between the two figures has then been translated intodays of the year, and this has then been added to - or subtracted from- the British Tax Freedom Day.In 1996, the average UK employee will have to work 142 days, that isuntil Tuesday May 21 to pay off his or her tax bill, the same number ofdays as last year. The 2p reduction in the standard rate of income taxannounced in the November budget has been offset by increases in otherareas, such as excise duties on tobacco and petrol.Nonetheless, the situation is still an improvement on the 1970s andearly-1980s when the tax burden was much higher. The 1980s and early-1990s saw a continuous fall in the tax burden with Tax Freedom Daymoving earlier and earlier from June 6 in 1982 to May 17 in 1993. Itthen shot back five days in 1995 and shows little sign of reverting tothe 1980s trend.The situation would be even worse if government borrowing was takeninto account, however. Stein argues that this should be added to thetotal burden of taxation, since it eventually has to be paid for byfuture taxpayers. This would mean that the UK taxpayer would not befree of both burdens until Monday June 3. Nonetheless, as a result of afall in government borrowing, this would be an improvement on thesituation in 1993 when the relevant day was June 13.For much of the European Union, where many countries have much heavierdebt burdens than the UK, the situation would have been even worse.As tax burdens rise, as governments attempt to conform with theMaastricht criteria before 1999, this should mean that there should besubstantial opportunities for private bankers, especially those whichplace emphasis on tax-planning.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Ulrich Sutter talked to DrSieghardt RometschTHE PAST year produced outstanding results for Trinkaus & Burkhardt,one of Germany's oldest private banks. Net profits increased by 24.9percent to DM92.9 million ($64 million), an all-time high.Interest income leaped to DM177.7 million, an increase of 23,7 percenton the previous year, while commission income was marginally down by3.4 percent at DM160.6 million. Since flotation in 1985, Trinkaus hasseen its total asset base jump by more than 260 percent.Operating from their Dusseldorf headquarters overlooking theprestigious Konigsallee, Trinkaus has experienced its fair share of upsand downs especially during the 1970s and early 1980s, admits DrSieghardt Rometsch, a partner responsible for corporate banking."The bank was caught up in the aftermath of the Herstatt bankingcollapse. Despite performing well, we were forced to look for outsidehelp to rebuild our capital base, and this resulted in Citibankacquiring a controlling stake. This produced a change of strategy andwe abandoned retail banking," said Rometsch."The Citibank connection was relatively short-lived, and in 1980 thebank was acquired by Midland Bank. Our fortunes changed rapidly,largely as a result of Midland Bank's decision to give us a largedegree of autonomy. It surely was paramount to the success we haveachieved so far", he said with pride. "Reducing Midland's shareholdingfrom 90 percent to 70 percent subsequently helped strengthen ourposition with our customers as an independent private bank."A former general manager with Chase Manhattan Bank, Rometsch arguesthat most foreign banks have failed to be profitable in the Germanmarket, as a consequence of adopting relatively short-term strategies."The exception, of course, is Citibank which has successfullyestablished itself in the retail banking sector. The vast majority ofbanks, however, do not understand that private banking is predicated onrelationships and has to grow organically. It will sometimes take yearsfor a relationship to create the trust necessary to sustain profitablebusiness. Once we have crossed this line, they accept us as partners.Only then will the typical private banking client entrust larger sumsto us."Rometsch is also critical of many foreign banks management systems."These often reduce the individual's creativity and his overallperformance. Matrix management is still very common especially with USbanks. From my own experience, I have found this style a handicap tothe successful private banker."Since Trinkaus & Burkhardt abandoned retail banking to concentrate onasset management, securities and corporate banking, its performance hasimproved significantly. The bank now has some DM35 billion of assetsunder management of which DM18 billion comes from private bankingclients.Contrary to the industry trend, which has resulted in a reduction ofminimum thresholds, private banking clients must have at least DM1billion in free assets of which they must place DM250,000 withTrinkaus."As soon as profit margins were being squeezed, we decided to setrigorous benchmarks, to avoid getting involved in price competition. Weanalysed our markets and came to the conclusion that we had a franchisein the regional Mittelstand market, especially in companies with aminimum turnover of between DM100 million-DM200 million. I think youneed a certain minimum size to be able to stay in the business and todeliver good performance.""A typical account manager at Trinkaus will look after between 40-60clients. Training has been made a priority since the mid-1980s. Ourstaff spend an annual average of 60-90 hours on in-house training."As a small private bank we are fully aware that we must be availablefor our clients from 9 am to 5 pm. So our approach is somewhatdifferent from other institutions. We just don't think it isjustifiable to send them on seminars in training centres. After all,our clients should expect excellent performance and this means that weshould be working all the time".International expansion has so far been on a modest scale. Besides fivedomestic offices, representative offices were set up in Luxembourg andZurich in the late-1970s. Overall, business expansion has largelyconcentrated on the affluent region of North Rhine Westphalia."The Mittelstand is our main business focus", explains Rometsch."Although they have always been very export-oriented, they simply havenot achieved much penetration in Far Eastern markets, although we hopethis may change."The Hong Kong of German industry is eastern Europe. They are morecomfortable with the distance and culture and a majority speak theGerman language. Today our natural market also includes Luxembourg andparts of the Netherlands, where we are experiencing good results. WhenHSBC decided to close their Luxembourg banking activities it was onlynatural for Trinkaus to look after their clients. Through thisconnection we maintain an Asian client base".The integration process within the HSBC Group has been smooth. "Ourlink with HSBC is a strong selling argument", he claims. "We haveintroduced a substantial number of clients to HSBC. Nevertheless, wehave to be aware, that operating as a private bank within a groupnetwork requires enormous sensitivity on our part. It is almost like awalk on a razor blade - as independent private bank operating withinthe network of one of the world's largest banks."European expansion plans, however, are far off the agenda at Trinkaus."We have no plans to become a global player in the private bankingmarket. We are a truly German private bank with strong roots in theMittelstand. This is our strength on which we have built our expertiseover centuries".Rometsch concluded: "If clients within the HSBC Group need advice on DMproducts, they certainly find them at Trinkaus & Burkhardt."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BACK TO THE FUTURE?Midland Bank, a UK subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai BankingCorporation (HSBC), established a domestic private bank in 1993 whicheschewed much of the conventional wisdom associated with the sector.Ian Orton spoke to Peter Renn, its first managing director, about thephilosophy behind the initiative and the progress achieved to dateOF ALL the new domestic private banks established by the large UKfinancial institutions during the 1990s Midland Private Banking hasundoubtedly attracted the most interest, not least because of itsdecision to use staff drawn from the commercial bank.Purists could argue that Midland's initiative is yet another instanceof the private banking moniker being devalued. For Peter Renn, however,the establishment of Midland's private bank, is a natural consequenceof the changes affecting the UK banking sector generally."The UK retail banking sector has experienced rapid change over thelast ten years. This is particularly the case as far as serviceprovision has been concerned. New technology is making it easier toservice retail customers through remote media. There are far fewerbranches. However, there is still a demand for personal service,especially from the more affluent segment of the customer base. Hencethe decision to establish the domestic private bank."According to Renn, in some respects the establishment of domesticprivate banks by the large UK banks is a throwback to an earlier era.The UK banks only became mass market institutions during the 1960s.Before then their customer base had an element of exclusivity. In thisenvironment it was possible to provide a relatively high level ofpersonal service, albeit in a much more narrowly defined market.Thirty years on, the new private banks are attempting to re-establishan aura of exclusivity and personal service - and generate high qualityfee and commission income as a consequence."It is also a natural consequence to an increasingly competitiveenvironment. Product differentiation and market segmentation arelogical responses to increased competition," said Renn.The HSBC UK strategyThe domestic private bank was an outcome of a global review of itsinterests in this sector conducted by HSBC following its acquisition ofMidland in 1992.At that time, Midland had two operations which catered for thefinancial services requirements of the affluent. Samuel Montagu cateredfor very high net worth individuals. Midland Personal Asset Managementcatered for the needs of private clients with more modest means.The review resulted in the pooling together of the group'sinternational private banking operations under the umbrella of HSBC.Each of the component banks would retain or operate with its own namein order to capitalise on existing reputations and ensure that staffand relationships were country-focused rather than legalentity-focused.This meant that in the UK Samuel Montagu and the British Bank of theMiddle East would continue to cater for the financial elite from ajoint office in Hill Street, London. It was also decided to establish adomestic private bank based on Midland Personal Asset Management."It was a natural outcome. The Personal Asset Management business had anumber of private banking elements such as a brokerage, fund managementand trusts. What it didn't have were the human resources or the brandrecognition to communicate a quality service image. The establishmentof a private bank provided an opportunity for these attributes to beprovided," said Renn.The importance of personal serviceThe provision of a high level of service was perceived from the outsetas the key to enabling Midland to differentiate itself from otherinstitutions."There is no shortage of definitions of private banking or, for thatmatter, private banks. I think the term private banking should reallybe used to describe the market rather than the nature of the productsor services provided. Private banks can trace their origin to a numberof sources - legal and accounting firms, fund managers, stockbrokers,even commercial banks."Although each institution will attempt to follow a different strategythere is often one basic similarity between them - they will tend toemphasise one particular product. This will often reflect theirorigins. Private banks which evolved out of legal or accountingpartnerships will emphasise their trust and tax planning capabilities,asset management specialists their fund management skills and so on. Inother words, the nature of the service will be product-orientated."At Midland we had to decide whether to go down a similar route and, ifso, what type of products we should offer. After conducting a lot ofresearch we decided to go down a different route by making theprovision of high quality service the keystone of our strategy".Customer preferencesMidland's research suggested that prospective clients were looking foradvice and an ongoing relationship from a private bank. "There is adefinite gap in the market as far as the provision of advice isconcerned. Although people are becoming more affluent there is noshortage of financial worries. There is less certainty of unbrokenunemployment. People are living longer. Meanwhile, the government isreducing health and welfare provision. No matter how affluent they maybe now, people are being forced to address long-term financial planningissues and they need advice."The research also showed that potential clients were not particularlyinterested in being sold a plethora of banking or investment products.Nonetheless, they were appreciative of a broad range of productofferings drawn from a variety of suppliers.They were also looking for specific - or rather seamless solutions totheir financial problems. It was clear from the outset that "packaged"solutions would not generate much enthusiasm.The emphasis placed on advice and the preference for a "bespoke"private banking service was critical in a number of respects. Despitethe fact that an organisation the size of HSBC is in a position toprovide from its own resources all of the products and servicestraditionally associated with private banking, it was felt that theprivate bank should function as an independent intermediary. It wouldtherefore have the freedom to buy in - on the client's behalf - anyrelevant product or service.Second, given the nature of the "product" offered, considerableemphasis was placed on the ability of relationship managers to provideservice of a quality that would satisfy prospective clients.Relationship managers in this environment have to encapsulate a numberof skills and functions and must develop an almost encyclopedicknowledge of the banking and financial services sector. They also haveto be readily accessible.Staffing the private bankMidland decided to staff the bank with people drawn from the commercialbank supplemented, where necessary, by outside recruits. These wereoften drawn from the IFA sector. Although this decision has beengreeted with some surprise by outside commentators - not to mentioncompetitors - Renn is unrepentant about the efficacy of the approach."The first point to make is that in the current UK regulatoryenvironment it is virtually impossible for unqualified personnel to belet loose in the private banking market. All of our people wererigorously trained and are in receipt of one of the qualificationsrecognised by the Personal Investment Authority."We also used very stringent selection criteria to identify potentialrelationship managers. We understood quite clearly that wealthycustomers will only deal with experienced people with the authority totake decisions and act on them."The commercial bank was in a position to meet this requirement. "A bitof grey hair does you no harm in this particular environment. AtMidland, we had quite a large pool of very experienced bankers to drawon. Many of the bank's more senior personnel could look back on 20 or25 years of banking experience. We were very keen to encourage thesepeople to come and work for us."It was also decided from the outset to provide the bank with a localfocus. "We thought it was of critical importance to ensure that ourpeople were locally based - not located in a remote City office. Youcan't develop significant relationships if the customer has to travelto London every time he, or she, wants to see a private banker."There are over 30 Midland Private Banking branches located throughoutEngland and Wales. They share a common location with the commercialbank branches.Tied versus IFA statusMidland's strategy meant that the new private bank's "natural"competitors would be the IFA sector. "These are the institutions whichmost closely match what Midland are trying to do."The decision to go down the IFA route or to concentrate on sellingMidland or HSBC products was a tough one to make. We rejected the tiedoption. We knew that customers might feel compromised by being offeredonly Midland or HSBC-branded products. Their options are limited."We also decided to stay clear of packaged products and services.First, a package will not necessarily address the specific customerrequirements. Second, customers may feel that they are having to payfor something they do not really need. A `bespoke' approach is muchmore efficacious. It is cost effective - customers only pay for whatthey need - and it is much more flexible. It doesn't cost much more toselect and manage a customised portfolio of stocks and shares than unittrusts, for example."Pricing was something that Midland Private Banking was conscious offrom the outset. "Although the customer base was comfortably off, wewere conscious of the fact that, in many instances their money had beenhard earned. They did not expect to be ripped off."Positional advantagesRenn maintains that the bank had two important positional advantagesover the IFA sector, however. The first was that it had awell-recognised brand name. The second was that it could rely on thecommercial bank for potential customers."On the whole, IFAs do a very good job in the financial planning andwealth management market. Nonetheless clients are sometimes put off bya relative lack of security. There have been a number ofwell-publicised cases involving IFAs where probity - and the securityof the client's assets - has been severely compromised."Clients do run a notional risk assessment of institutions. One of theperceived strengths of the Midland Bank name is that we are a large,safe and well-run institution. Size is important in this market as, Ithink, the aftermath of the Barings crash showed."The bulk of the private bank's customers have been generated byinternal referrals. The customer threshold is income or free assets of#100,000, although this is more a guideline figure rather than a stricteligibility criterion. "Midland Private Banking targets the`comfortably off' portion of the market rather than the very affluent".Renn admits that a customer recruitment strategy which relied veryheavily on referrals from the commercial bank could have beenproblematic. This is especially the case in the new sales culture whichis permeating retail banks. A customer lost to the private bank maymean the loss of potential sales revenue for the retail bank."There is always scope for a potential conflict of interest unless youmake sure you have the right organisational structure in place. We werehelped by the fact that local private bank branches were structured aspart of the General Manager's department. As such, a referral amountedto an internal transfer within a single arena, not a transfer from onedepartment to another. We were also fortunate in that when the bank wasbeing set up, the Midland branch network was in the process ofupheaval. Very senior bankers were being put back into the branches andthis probably eased the transition."In practice, the strategy has worked well with the commercial bankgenerating a substantial proportion of Midland Private Banking'scustomer base. "In most cases, we have had an almost seamless transferof an old relationship". During the first half of 1995, for example,the retail branch network generated 3,500 customers.The futureRenn maintains that the future for the UK private banking sector isvery good. The market is opening up and many of the old cliches are nolonger relevant. There is a lot of "new money" about. Senior companyexecutives, entrepreneurs, media people, athletes - even lotterywinners are domestic private banks' natural constituency. MidlandPrivate Bankers is well placed to take advantage.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"We wantto become the card of choice in our cardholders' wallets."The move comes at an especially important time for AT&T, bothcorporately and in the card unit itself. AT&T Universal suffered acharge-off rate of 6 percent, adding up to a $39 million loss, duringthe third quarter of 1996. It was largely in anticipation of thisdisappointing result that unit president David Hunt resigned late lastsummer (see Cards International 163).More recently, and on the heels of Universal Card's disappointing thirdquarter, AT&T chairman Robert Allen named John Walter president, chiefoperating officer and chief executive of the telecommunications giant.The appointment prompted renewed industry speculation that AT&T willseek to spin off or simply sell the Universal Card portfolio."It is certainly not going to surprise anyone if it does go on theblock," said an industry observer. As for the rate cut itself, fewthink other issuers will respond."It has that sort of scent to it; a desperation move," said BruceBrittain, president of Brittain Associates, an Atlanta-based marketresearch firm. "It has just not been terribly successful in gettingrevolvers."According to Brittain, the industry average for revolving a balancefrom one month to another is 60 percent, while on the AT&T card it is39 percent. "And it was 39 percent in the third quarter of last year,so it hasn't seen any improvement," he added."It is true that we have a large share of transactors," Kolakowskisaid, "but we can rely on our AT&T relationship to make that aprofitable relationship." Speaking of the rate cut, she said, "We doexpect it to have a positive effect in 1996."Kolakowski expected more aggressive marketing from AT&T Universal inthe near term, and described the card unit's strategy as twofold."We are aggressively pursuing strategies to control our losses, and allour marketing programmes are going to concentrate on getting a greatershare of cardholders' wallets." Controlling losses, she said, would bemainly a matter of tightening credit standards: "We have slicedacquisitions in 1996."While AT&T Universal is the world's third largest card issuer in numberof cards in circulation, behind Dean Witter, Discover and Citicorp with24 cards and 18 million accounts respectively, it is seventh inreceivables.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"The first phase will see thelaunch of both classic and gold Visa cards, as well as attractiveadditional account and card-based services providing broad customerappeal," Sainsbury said in a statement.The new 24-hour banking operation will be telephone-based and willoperate out of the Bank of Scotland's call centre in Edinburgh,alongside the Scottish bank's own Banking Direct service, rather thanas part of it."We have the necessary infrastructure in place, but the productsoffered will differ. They will be genuine Sainsbury products," said IanFiddes, the bank's director of marketing services.Sainsbury said it would be the first supermarket retailer to enter theconsumer banking market. The only other UK retailer to possess such alicence is Marks & Spencer, which launched its charge card back in1987.The move has wrong-footed its main rival, Tesco, which, untilSainsbury's announcement on October 25, had led moves by UK supermarketgroups into the financial services market.Tesco launched its own budget account in June, offering 5.12 percentinterest on deposits, ten times some bank and building society depositrates. This, however, is operated by NatWest, which possesses thebanking licence. One leading UK banking analyst said the Sainsbury'smove was "one big step on from that".Tesco, which has recently taken over from Sainsbury as the UK's biggestsupermarket group, refused to say whether it would respond by settingup its own bank. "We do not comment on the activities of our rivals," aspokeswoman said.But other retailers have not discounted such a move. Kevin Hawkins,Safeway's head of communications, said: "We have not ruled out theprovision of financial services should it fit with our customerproposition."For some time now, UK banks have had problems with their public imageand are becoming increasingly concerned with the activities of the more"consumer-friendly" retailers. Bankers and analysts alike are promotingcollaborative joint ventures, like the Sainsbury venture, as the wayforward.Tony Surridge, head of co-branding at NatWest UK, who was behind thebank's joint venture with Tesco, said if the UK banks did not set upalliances with retailers, US credit card operators would. "We wouldrather be inside the goldfish bowl than looking in from outside," hesaid.Recently, British Gas, a major UK utility, and HFC Bank, a subsidiaryof the US Household Financial Corporation, teamed up to form GoldbrandDevelopment to manage its new Goldfish credit card. The Goldfish creditcard offers a loyalty point scheme whereby customers can save up to #75on their gas bills.British Gas and HFC said the Goldbrand joint venture company was aimingto"rewrite the rules in financial services".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The card isbeing offered to all Bangkok Life Assurance clients with individual orgroup life policies.The affinity card is being offered as a blue or gold proprietary card,and with classic and gold Visa card and standard and gold MasterCardoptions.The joining fee has been waived for applications before the end of theyear, as has half of the annual fee for the first year.Otherwise, joining fees are Bt300 and Bt400 for local blue and goldcards respectively and Bt600 for the international options. Full annualfees are Bt600 for the blue cards, Bt900 for the local gold cards,Bt1,000 for the classic/standard card and Bt1,500 for the internationalgold card.In April, Bangkok Bank launched a similar card with Bangkok Insuranceoffering two alternatives - Bt500,000 cover or Bt300,000 insuranceagainst death or illness at a monthly premium of Bt235 to Bt2,510 andBt140 to Bt1,506 respectively. The cover is limited to cancerdiagnosis, a disease which is one of the biggest killers of Thais.The scheme was targeted at all Bangkok Bank cardholders aged between 21and 59 years, although applicants were required to fill in a healthform.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

A little more than half of US consumerswho own a co-branded airline card say that owning the card influencestheir choice of carrier, according to a new study by BrittainAssociates, an Atlanta-based research firm."Airline frequent-flier programmes have a lot of appeal to a fairlynarrow segment, but it's a viciously loyal segment," principal BruceBrittain told Cards International.According to the study, about 6 percent of all US households claim toown a credit card that provides air travel rewards linked to cardusage. Of these programmes, ten are co-branded card issues bearingeither the MasterCard or Visa marque, along with a bank's. Four of theprogrammes generate points that can be redeemed for travel on anyairline."The majority of owners tell us that they use the card both for airfareand other purchases," Brittain said. "And compared to other co-brandedcards we study, airline card owners use these cards much morefrequently."It was such loyalty that American Express and Advanta hope to breakwith their Rewards Accelerator Card that enables users to earn pointson their Amex membership rewards programme through a bank card (seepages 1 and 6).Among the surprises in the study, Brittain said, was the rapid growthof the Delta SkyMiles Optima portfolio. "It's really vaulted up there,"he said, and now rivals United's programme. Amex was careful to forbidbalance transfer from any Optima card to the new Rewards Accelerator.Brittain added, however, that"the American Airlines AAdvantageportfolio with Citibank is still the 800lbs gorilla among theseprogrammes, with twice as much business as its nearest competitors."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

According to the suit, themerchants' profitability may erode when customers are allowed topresent online Visa debit cards.Visa, according to its statement, "will vigorously defend this actionand believe that we will prevail".The grounds on which it will defend itself hinge on two points,according to Stephen Theoharis, senior vice-president and director oflitigation with the card association.First, he said, Visa successfully defended itself against a similarsuit brought in 1983 by upscale retailer Nordstrom's. Second, itregards the "honour all cards rule" as fostering rather than stiflingcompetition worldwide."If I can go into one of 13 million establishments worldwide andpresent any Visa card for payment, we believe that encouragescompetition," he said.Regarding Visa's use of Nordstrom's precedent, the only differencebetween 1983 and 1996, Theoharis said, is the enormously-enhancednumber of debit cards, offline and online, in circulation."Clearly, the debit card has been embraced by consumers," Theoharissaid. "But the number of cards has nothing to do with the issuelegally." There are about 35 million offline, or "cheque" cardscurrently in circulation in the US.Theoharis added: "They seem to be arguing that the debit transaction beprocessed over regional POS networks. But what they don't seem tounderstand is that one half of the bank ATM cards that are also debitcards are Visa cheque cards.  "I think there is a misperception on Wal-Mart's part. We have no rules for routing transactions. The merchantsare free to route that transaction as they see fit."Curiously, MasterCard International, which has a similar rule, was notmentioned in the suit. Industry speculation centres on Wal-Mart'sreluctance to sue MasterCard, its partner in a recent agreement tooffer the retailer's first-ever co-branded credit card in associationwith Chase Manhattan and FDR.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE LABEL CARD BULLETIN via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BRANDING MEANS BONDINGIn an increasingly-competitive cards market, a co-branding programmecan provide issuers with a keen edgeOVER THE past year co-branded and affinity products have outperformedall other card products in the market place. As competition becomesmore fierce and brand loyalty decreases, co-branding is taking on a newsignificance, Virlea Mays, president of the Mays Marketing Group tolddelegates at Lafferty's International Retail Financial ServicesConference for Southern Africa in October."If we want the customer to want, use and keep our products, the way westructure strategies and go to the market with our card products iscritical," she said."The credit card business is intensely competitive. It is expensive tomarket, especially in the US, and by combining the marketing resourcesand marketing expertise of two major organisations, you get moremuscle."Co-branding offers significant benefits and enhancements to bothparties. Marketing expertise is shared by the issuer and co-brander, asis the revenue.The co-brander is typically profit-driven and usually has a recognisedbrand or logo, merchant outlets and sales volume, often through aproprietary card. Solicitation is done primarily by or through the co-brander.But the co-branding process is fraught with difficulties. Finding theright partner and working out the relationship may seemstraightforward, but it is often not the case."The associations are important but the co-brand partner and the issuerare the most critical component. And as they develop the partnership,the most important thing is to define the contractual relationship andthe product and the value proposition of that product," said Mays.The partners must start with an equitable contract and establish mutualobjectives. The two sides should design the product, value propositionand packaging, and define credit approval criteria and credit limits.A marketing plan should be developed and quality service standardsdefined. While the ongoing relationship should be formalised, decision-making and conflict/resolution processes and a termination agreementshould also be defined. But for the issuer, negotiating revenue andexpense sharing details is crucial."The ability to forecast how the revenue is shared can make thedifference for the issuer in terms of complete and total profit andloss," explained Mays. "A lot of contracts were written so that theissuer ends up with all of the responsibility and takes the full bruntof the loss if the product fails or the programme simply doesn't work."The time spent developing the partnership and working on the contractis a key factor and one that is often overlooked, according to Mays."This is where the time needs to be taken and in most cases is not.Everybody is rushing to get to the market and the correct length oftime is often not taken in the development of the contract," she said.The length of the contract also has to be worked out and Mays adviseddelegates to settle for a contract of between seven and ten years."Nobody is down in the three-year range, except maybe some affinityprogrammes. There may be some five-year contracts out there, but thereis just too much riding on this, so contracts should be in theneighbourhood of seven to ten years," she said.When working out the rebate and reward structure, the co-brandingpartners should be careful to make the product easy for the customer tounderstand."Some rebate and reward structures work very well, some are way toocomplicated for a consumer to really get caught up in to use the card,"said Mays.She cited a survey conducted by Visa in the US where consumersindicated they wanted something that is simple and easy to use."We are all customers and we don't want a ten-page book to figure outhow to get our reward," she said. "We want reasonably easygratification and no tricks, no restrictions, no caps and no finepoints."The process is attempting to create a connection with the customer andcreate some sort of emotional connection, even if that emotion isgreed."When the product is designed, the next piece of the equation is todefine the marketing plan. This involves developing strategies for:* Acquisition - acquire new accounts and appeal to customers to wantthe card.* Activation - generate a balance and induce activity so the cardholderwill use the account.* Retention - become the "card of choice", so profitable customers keepaccounts."Many of the programmes designed in the US and in other parts of theworld, such as AT&T, do a great job in acquiring but they do not do thebest job possible at activation. The activation today in AT&T is stillonly about 49 percent and the industry average is 65 percent," saidMays.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It would bethe biggest such securitization ever.     The city has approximately 250,000 properties with tax arrearstotaling over $2 billion, according to a request-for-proposal document; andit is looking for a team of two to four bankers to underwrite the seniornotes, expected to receive an investment grade rating.     Although the document states that an objective is to complete thetransaction by April 15 -- a timetable one source described as "prettytight" -- the letter also cautions that the implementation and completionof any transaction is subject to the New York City Council's enactment ofpending legislation to permit bulk lien sales. WR Lazard & Co. is thecity's advisor.     A source at City Hall said one of the main goals of the pendinglegislation and securitization is to "enforce taxes" and remove the city asthe lender of last resort, which is what it essentially becomes whensomeone falls behind on their property taxes. The proposed issue will bebacked by the better-quality of these tax liens, mostly commercial realestate with a high likelihood of repayment.     One of the basic principles behind these transactions is that thepooled tax liens will eventually generate cash in one of three ways: theproperty owner will pay the back taxes, the bank will foreclose and pay theback taxes, or the municipality will itself foreclose and sell theproperty.     According to the city, the proposed and subsequent securitizationswill accomplish four things: to increase the cashflow from delinquent taxliens; provide an efficient real property tax enforcement mechanism;increase the current property tax collection rate; and reduce the need forthe city to assume ownership of properties in tax arrears.     "The sale of liens represents a faster, cheaper, and more efficientmethod to enforce property tax collection than the ... foreclosure processthe City currently uses. Tax lien sales will enable the City to restorefairness to the property tax collection system, maintain and improvecollection rates, generate additional cash for operations, and relieveupward pressure on property taxes. Key to the success of a long-term saleprogram will be the initial securitization," the request for proposalstates.     The issue will be sold to institutional investors, but unlike atraditional private placement, the issue will be fully underwritten by theinvestment banks, which will assume some risk. It will not be a best-efforts transaction, the source at City Hall said. The raised capital willbe funneled into the city's operations fund.     The deadline for bankers to submit proposals to the city was lastFriday, and a team of underwriters is expected to be chosen in about twoweeks.     Which underwriters the city will choose is anyone's guess, but onequestion in the document does ask bankers to describe their experienceimplementing new products such as tax lien securitizations. And the list ofthose with specific tax lien securitization experience is quite short.     Most recent was Smith Barney, which priced a $19 million issue for theCity of New Haven, Conn., in the fall. The issue has a two-year average,seven-year final life, priced at 220 basis points off the curve, and had$25 million of collateral. Fitch Investors Service rated it BBB and ThePrincipal Finance Group scooped up the entire offering.     New Haven sold its liens into a trust, which then issued the taxablenotes. There will be no recourse to New Haven and in this way is similar toa deal in the fall of 1994 from Jersey City, N.J., which was agented by CSFirst Boston.     Other tax lien deals are due to follow soon. Breen Capital Group isabout to launch a $50 million securitization backed by a diverse pool oftax liens, culled from its own portfolio. The deal, which will be placed byBarclays de Zoete Wedd, is currently structured with a four-year final,two-year average life. The deal will likely be overcollateralized.     Price talk has not been heard yet, but because the portfolio is "hand-picked" and will not carry the concentration risk of a single-city deal,BZW will aim for a tighter spread than New Haven, a source said. Both Fitchand Standard & Poor's are expected to rate the transaction.     Meanwhile, Philadelphia is expected to make its securitization planspublic soon. The city is rumored to be planning a $150 million issue.Back to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE PLACEMENT REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996ELKEM FROM LAND OF REINDEERBarclays de Zoete Wedd was roadshowing a $60 million issue last weekfor Elkem A/S, a Norwegian metals company with sales last year ofapproximately $1.4 billion.     The company, considered a mid-BBB, is reportedly looking for 10- of12-year money in the form of senior unsecured notes. Price talk was 130over Treasurys. Bids were expected this week.     One investor expressed concern about the company's cyclicality, notingthat Elkem is coming off its best earnings in six or seven years. "I thinkit's on the fence between an NAIC-2 and 3," the investor said.     Last fall ABN-AMRO brought a $20 million deal from Elkem's U.S.subsidiary. Those senior notes, considered an NAIC-2, had a 10-year final,seven-year average life and priced at 125 off the curve.

The deal would be just the third under anew program by the International Finance Corp., an arm of the World Bank.     The deal comes on the heels of another IFC-linked deal. Just beforeChristmas, J.P. Morgan and ING Securities placed a $100 million issue withinstitutional investors for Grupo Industrial Bimbo, S.A. (Gibsa), whichowns a popular Mexican bread sold under the brand name Bimbo (PPR Nov. 13,p. 1).     Under the program, the IFC extends a loan to the company and keeps asmall portion for its own account. It then sells the remainder to aDelaware trust in form of participation interests subsequently issued toinvestors.     As a division of the World Bank, the IFC can ensure certain paymentguarantees that generally yield an investment grade rating.     Details about the Edelsur deal were sketchy at press time, but sourcessaid it was apparently divided into floating- and fixed-rated tranches thatwould be filled out according to demand. Price talk was reportedly Liborplus 200 for the floater and the equivalent spread for the fixed.     On the Gibsa transaction, more details were available. The 10-yearbullet priced at 305 off the curve and was popularly referred to byinvestors as the Bimbo deal. The structure did evolve somewhat since itfirst hit the market mid-November. At that time it had a 12-year final,seven-year average life and the notes were being talked at 275 to 285 offthe curve.     Gibsa, with sales last year of $1.25 billion, was founded in 1945 andmakes such products as breads, cakes, potato chips, and tortilla chips,among others. Besides a 90% market share in much of Mexico, the company hasplants in Argentina, Chile, Guatemala and El Salvador. It has also startedto make some acquisitions in the U.S. tortilla market.     A source pointed out that the company's distribution network is soextensive and well respected that Gibsa currently has a distributionagreement with Mars, and until recently also had one with Wrigley's.     The new program is part of the IFC's attempt to tap the U.S.institutional market -- such as insurance companies and pension funds.Back to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE PLACEMENT REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996ABN-AMRO PAVES WAY FOR ROGERSABN-AMRO recently found circles for a $25 million issue from RogersGroup, one of the largest aggregate companies in the nation.

The secured loan certificates were reportedly broken into twotranches, a 17-year final, 11-year average life with price talk at 70 to 75off the curve; and a 21-year final, 20-year average life with price talk at105 over Treasurys.     One buy-side source said those spreads offered some decent value.French-based Airbus Industrie, an equipment manufacturer, is considered adouble A minus credit.     Last January Salomon led a  $108 million leveraged lease transactionfor Airbus broken into two tranches. Final pricing was not available. Butthe 10-year average life strip started at 85 basis points over the curve;while price talk on the 20-year average life tranche started at 115 basispoints over Treasurys.

But is Enami's fate indicative of what willhappen to similar issues in 1996?     When Enami, Chile's second largest copper producer, hit the market inlate October, price talk was a tight 95 off the curve for the seven-yearpaper. But the BBB+ paper quickly widened to 120.     "The market was demanding much wider spreads than was initiallyanticipated," a source said.     Unfortunately for Enami, its entry into the market coincided with ageneral widening of emerging market spreads, particularly those "quasi"emerging markets whose sovereign rating is investment grade, such as Chile,Malaysia and the Czech Republic, sources said.     For instance, a recent public Chilean deal from Celulosa Arauco yConstitucion SA also had to swallow a wider spread than initiallyanticipated. An eight-year tranche that started at 80 over Treasurys gotdone at 105 and has since traded even wider.     "It's not a dramatic shift, and it's not just Chile, and it'll stillbe a good year," a source said. "But you'd expect it to be a runaway yearfor issuance given that long-term interest rates are at a 20-year low. Butwith banks so aggressive, I don't think you'll see the amount of issues inthe private market you might expect. The few basis points (the banks willgive over institutional investors) do matter."Back to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE PLACEMENT REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996COBHAM LOOKS FOR U.S. INVESTORSSchroder Wertheim was circulating a $50 million issue last week forCobham plc., a U.K.-based aerospace company.

The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100 million offeringof 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basis points overTreasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. The notes,which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language, enablinga public-style execution of the offering without registration at theSecurities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resulted fromStandard & Poor's rating the issue just below investment grade, said AnnieAstor, chief financial officer.     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low rates inDecember, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank toissue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's firstindependent bond offering.     Jefferies & Co. captured the lead underwriting position on the dealbecause of its relationship with the bank, and Smith Barney Inc. acted asco-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15 insurancecompanies.     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part by the bank'sphenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has had an averagereturn on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since the bank'sinitial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciated in valueby 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billion assetbank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter last year.     The deal for FirstBank follows a first-time subordinated offering byanother Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in the month. BanPonceCorp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in 10-yearsubordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125million.

The compliance program at the new holding company, FirstChicago/NBD Corp., will probably be run in a similar way, Dan Lis said.Only the holding companies have currently merged; the only banks that willmerge are in Illinois--NBD Illinois and First National Bank of Chicago--which will merge at mid-year. At that time NBD will fold into FirstNational.        So far, the plan of how to structure the new compliance programhasn't yet gone to senior management or been implemented, but according tobank executives this is not a problem.        "There was no danger in not having a compliance program completelyset up in time for the merger, because our functions and the way the twobanks approached compliance were very similar," said Lis. "We will not haveany gaps in coverage because of this."        How to merge CRA functions, which are separate from compliance,also wasn't considered until after the merger. According to M. Chris Snow,NBD's CRA officer, before Dec. 1 the CRA department was just making sure itgot through the approval process, which included a couple of protests."When we sat down to combine our offices, we realized that our publicaffairs divisions both held CRA (departments), but were different in otherways," said Snow. "So far we've only had two meetings to integrate thedepartments."        Lis said that like the pre-merged institutions, First Chicago/NBDCorp. will probably have corporate compliance officers in each line ofmanufacturing business, who will have corporate-wide responsibility. Therewill probably also be distribution compliance officers in charge of eachstate, since each state operation serves as a distribution arm of productsand services, speculated Lis. Those officers will report to the bankpresident of that state.        Those officers, together with certain executive officers, includingthose of the law and auditing departments, will comprise a corporatecompliance committee. The auditing and law departments will serve assupport for the line management.        Lis said the manufacturing arms of the bank take up such retailbanking functions as mortgage, consumer banking, deposit services andmarketing. Distribution involves the sale of the bank's products.        "The most significant difference between the new compliancedepartment and the old ones is that before, at NBD, there was a singlecorporate compliance officer. Now we will use the corporate compliancecommittee structure, similar to the one First Chicago had," said Lis.        "There will also be some decrease in personnel due to redundancy asa result of the transition, not as a result of the new structure. Forexample, before we downsize there may be two lawyers who study the samereg, two compliance officers who monitor it, etc."        There won't be many problems combining the bank's CRA departmentseither, said Snow.        "Even though First Chicago was a larger bank, its market was smallcompared to ours, and its CRA was focused more in their public affairsgroup, out of their downtown Chicago office, since they didn't have manybranches," she said. "By contrast, NBD's CRA efforts were spread over fivestates, each with a state coordinator. Each state was also broken up intoregions, with a part-time regional person.        "I think we will move the centralized CRA to Chicago, like thecentralized lending analysis, since our corporate headquarters will bethere, and keep the information flowing back and forth from the regions,"Snow continued. "We still need to keep the regional efforts because theneeds of each state are different--CRA has to be much closer to thecustomer and geography. Before, we had to rely on a local person to tell uswhy a trend was the way it was, but the new reg lends itself more tocentralized data.        "Right now we're not worried about who will be in what job, butthat whatever data analyzer we purchase will be flexible enough to acceptdata from any operating system, be it consumer or commercial loaninformation. We'll have small business reporting from five different banks.        "Our CRA department is responsible for choosing the data baseanalyzer, and senior management and our technology task force is in chargeof hiring a geocoder and purchasing loan collection systems, sincemarketing will also use the information. We'll have some say in the latter,but not a lot of input."        "Then we'll make (CRA) lending decisions based on what the numberstell us. We would be doing the switch to data collection regardless, butthe merger will make the switch go faster, since we'll already be in achange mode."        "We might be hiring a couple of new people to do lending analysisfor the new CRA reg, the number will depend how much we can automate," saidSnow. "Our plan is not to grow our CRA department, since our CRA philosophyis to keep the authority with the local state bank president or regionaldirector. We hesitate to hire too many CRA people because it is too easy tooffload the responsibility to them."--Lisa TroshinskyBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LARGE BANKS FACE RISK-BASED EXAMSBy the end of the first quarter, large national banks can expect tobe examined against nine risk factors identified by the Office of theComptroller of the Currency.        The agency's new Supervision by Risk program, released Jan. 4 byway of its "Large Bank Supervision Handbook," is for national banks withtotal assets of at least $1 billion and for banks that are part of multi-bank holding companies with at least one bank with assets of $1 billion ormore.        Banks smaller than $1 billion in assets will be treated ascommunity banks and their new risk-focused exam guidelines are expected byJune.        Intending to help banks manage risk to capital and earnings,examiners will focus on credit, interest rate, liquidity, price, foreignexchange, transaction, compliance, strategic planning and reputation.Examiners will then put together a customer-tailored profile for each bank.        While the OCC has been examining banks based on a variety of risksfor several years, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said, the newhandbook marks the national standardization of this process.        "By delineating and defining each risk, bankers and examiners will,for the first time, be able to use the same terminology when discussingrisk-related issues, and examiners will be more consistent in theirapproach to similar institutions," said Ludwig.        Supervision by Risk, announced by Ludwig last September, will bepart of banks' annual on-site safety and soundness exams and might alsooccur throughout the year in various target examinations.        If a risk is identified as an unwarranted problem, banks will beexpected to take steps to correct the problem, and examiners will monitortheir progress.        The OCC has also provided a Risk Assessment System within thehandbook--a checklist within the nine risk categories, for banks' self-assessment regarding the quantity of risk, the quality of risk management,the level of supervisory concern, and the direction of risk.        Within each risk category, examiners will identify whether risk isincreasing, stable, or decreasing in each bank. The new handbook alsoemphasizes two-way communication about bank risk between bankers andexaminers.        According to the handbook, each bank's individualized riskmanagement program should include identification, measurement, control, andmonitoring of risks.        The OCC defines the nine risk categories as follows:         Credit: The risk from an obligor's failure to meet the terms ofany contract or fail to perform as agreed. Credit risk also arises inconjunction with selecting investment portfolio products, derivativestrading partners, or foreign exchange counterparties; through country orsovereign exposure; and through guarantor performance.         Interest Rate Risk: The risk from movements in interest rates.Should consider risk from both an accounting perspective (the effect on thebank's accrual earnings) and the economic perspective (the effect on themarket value of the bank's portfolio equity). In some banks, interest raterisk is captured under a broader category of market risk.         Liquidity Risk: The risk from a bank's inability to meet itsobligations when they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses.Includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in fundingsources; and the failure to address changes in market conditions thataffect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss invalue.         Price Risk: The risk from changes in the value of portfolios offinancial instruments. This risk arises from market-making, dealing, andposition-taking activities in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, andcommodities markets.         Foreign Exchange Risk: The risk from movement of foreign exchangerates, found in cross-border investing and operating activities. Market-making and position-taking in foreign currencies should be captured underprice risk.         Transaction Risk: The risk from problems with service or productdelivery--a function of internal controls, information systems, employeeintegrity, and operating processes.         Compliance Risk: The risk from violations or non-conformance withlaws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards. Alsoarises in situations where the laws or rules governing bank activities maybe ambiguous or untested. Compliance risk exposes the bank to fines, civilmoney penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts.         Strategic Risk: The risk from adverse business decisions orimproper implementation of those decisions. This risk focuses on more thanan analysis of the written strategic plan; it focuses on how plans,systems, and implementation affect the bank's franchise value.         Reputation Risk: The risk from negative public opinion, affectingthe bank's ability to establish new relationships or services, or continueservicing existing relationships. This risk can expose the bank tolitigation, financial loss, or damage to its reputation. Banks thatactively associate their name with products and services, such as withfiduciary services, are more likely to have higher reputation riskexposure.

Box 70004, Chicago, Ill. 70673-0004. oMortgage Reg OKs Endorsements        HUD-approved lenders participating in the Home Equity ConversionMortgage program can now process these loans without approval from thedepartment. HUD published its final rule Dec. 21 authorizing its approvedlenders to process HECM, or "reverse mortgage," loans under its directendorsement program.        Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17, but the finalrule, which appears in the Federal Register, makes the change official; italso completes one of many streamlining procedures HUD has initiated overthe last several months.        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECMthat lenders haven't issued a conditional commitment for is eligible fordirect endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insuredbefore Sept. 15, 1995, must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUDoffice for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance. If HUDdeems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, it will give thelender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DE program. oFannie Joins Plan For American Indians        Lenders will be able to begin offering mortgages to certainAmerican Indian tribes without the anxieties traditionally associated withlending on tribal trust lands.        Starting in January, Fannie will begin taking part in the RuralHousing Service's Rural Housing Native American pilot, but will limit itsinitial participation to 10 tribes.        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they havea good working relationship with the Rural Housing Service and the Bureauof Indian Affairs, although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be addedlater in the pilot.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996FLORIDA TO REQUIRE CONTINUING ED. FOR SECURITIESMark up Florida as the first state to follow national continuingeducation requirements. The Southeastern hotbed for bank securitiesactivities has become the first state in the nation to require continuingeducation for securities dealers.        A new administrative rule will go into effect for approximately130,000 securities sales, trading, and investment banking personnelregistered in Florida who have direct client contact, and their immediatesupervisors.        The rule requires Florida dealers and associated persons to complywith the same requirements as members of all the national exchanges, theNational Association of Securities Dealers, the Municipal SecuritiesRulemaking Board and the commodities regulatory agencies.        The rule also exempts registered representatives with 10 yearsexperience and a flawless disciplinary history from the regulatoryrequirements. Reps with the flawless disciplinary records make up about 17%of Florida's securities sales industry, according to the state securitiesregulator. However, all companies will be required to have a written planto develop and administer training programs tailored to specific trainingneeds regarding product lines and sales practices. The program went intoeffect at the start of the new year.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BRIEFSFed OKs Chase MergerBefore Ending CRA Check        The Federal Reserve on Jan. 5 approved the merger of ChemicalBanking Corp. with The Chase Manhattan Corp., a $10.4 billion deal thatwill create the country's largest bank.        Despite numerous complaints by community groups under the CommunityReinvestment Act, including two days of hearings in New York City inNovember, the Fed didn't include any conditions in its order, other thanrequiring the bank to fulfill an $18 billion CRA commitment it announcedlast fall.        The Fed said that both banks meet the credit needs of theircommunities, citing Chemical's lead bank's two consecutive "Outstanding"CRA grades and the Chase lead bank's recent "Satisfactory" ratings.        Activists were especially angry that the Fed didn't wait for theOCC to complete its CRA review of Chase before acting on the application.Instead, it relied on a 1993 exam.        The merger still has to be approved by the New York State BankingDepartment. oOCC To Relax RulesOn Community Work        The OCC has proposed streamlining its CRA regulations in order tospur more community investment by banks. Instead of the four-part test nowrequired of banks to prove that a community investment is in the publicinterest, the OCC would only require banks to self-certify that investmentswill benefit LMI families or small businesses.        The proposal is in the Dec. 28 Fed Register; comments are due bythe beginning of March.        "The proposed changes encourage national banks and community groupsto work together by allowing them the flexibility to determine how best tostructure their own partnerships in support of community development," saidComptroller Eugene A. Ludwig.        According to the OCC, national banks and their community partnershave invested a combined total of $2.16 billion in CDCs and communitydevelopment projects since December 1993, when the Community Developmentregulation was adopted.        The proposed revisions preserve the community development focus,but would:         Allow national banks greater flexibility to determine ifinvestments promote the public welfare by modifying the current publicwelfare test;         Retain the requirement that the investment primarily benefit LMIpersons, families, or small businesses, but make it clear that this benefitcan be provided in a variety of different ways;         Simplify the self-certification and prior approval processes byeliminating a current five-day OCC review period for investment proposalsthat the OCC has previously approved for another bank;         Eliminate the reg's list of eligible investment structures toallow bank management flexibility to determine appropriate structures forits investments.        Also, the OCC adopted a final rule Dec. 27 allowing banks toreinvest proceeds from these investments in any way they choose instead ofbeing required to reinvest in the community. oRegulators ClarifyCRA Transition        Federal banking regulators have clarified that once an institutionchooses or is forced to comply with the performance tests and standards ofthe new CRA, it must comply with all of the requirements of the new rule.(See Fed Register Dec. 20 and RCW Jan. 8 issue, p.2)        The regulators gave this example: Small institutions will beevaluated under the small bank performance standard beginning on Jan. 1,1996. But for examiners to properly evaluate a bank, the institution mustalso comply with other provisions of the new reg, including delineating anassessment area, maintaining a public file and providing proper publicnotice--requirements that don't under the transition rules, becomeapplicable until Jan. 1 or Jul 1, 1997.        In another example, if a large bank elects to be evaluated underthe lending, investment and service tests before being required to do so inJuly 1997, the bank would be required to comply on Jan. 1, 1996, with therule's other provisions.        The regulators also intend to provide banks with guidance on CRAstrategic plans--the types of information to include and when and where tofile the plans--and how to qualify for wholesale bank status. OTS, forexample, plans to issue a CEO letter in the near future. oManagement InterlocksChanges Proposed        The financial institution regulatory agencies published a proposedrule in the Federal Register Dec. 29 that revises their regulations onmanagement interlocks. Comments are due Feb. 27.        In order to remove unnecessary obstacles faced by small banksseeking to attract qualified management, the agencies propose to eliminatethe provision in the current rule that prohibits management interlocksbetween an institution under $20 million in assets and a bank with assetsof $20 million or more that are both located in the same MSA. This changeis intended to provide small banks with a larger pool of qualifiedcandidates for management positions.        The agencies aren't proposing any changes in the way the managementinterlocks regulation is applied to banks in the same community, a smallergeographic area than an MSA.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996CRAFor December, the OCC gave these banks "Outstanding" scores:CALIFORNIA: Six Rivers National Bank, Eureka;

Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers toraise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effectJan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider theviews of its customers before rendering a decision, may make itsannouncement as soon as Jan. 15.        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last twoweeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and thepotential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fullydiscuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said thosedetails would be made available shortly.        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgagecompanies that have traditionally directed most of their business to FannieMae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to takeadvantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not returnrequests for comments.        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddieraised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the lastmonth, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over thechange in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knewthat to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting toFreddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't besurprised."Back to Headline List WT03-B39-12IA059-000325-B027-139http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi102.html 205.156.212.5 19970115012457 text/html 65637HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:22:48 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:48:49 GMTContent-length: 65448Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi102.html Sample Issue Copyright RETAIL BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNet January 9, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES 1996: YEAR OF THE US INVASION?

Increasingliberalisation of interstate branching laws also means that trulynational banks are emerging in that country - something beginning to bereflected in the marketing campaigns of major banks.State barriers have not proved an obstacle to the major credit cardbanks in the US, which have seen their sophisticated marketingtechniques rewarded by extraordinary returns in their home market.Latterly, these banks have become increasingly visible abroad,particularly in Europe, where the credit card market remains full ofpotential compared with the saturated US scene.While, in the short-term, some major conventional US banks may bepreoccupied with effecting mergers in their home market, theindications are that once the domestic scene has settled down they andother organisations will surely turn to foreign markets. Already namessuch as Citibank, Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch InternationalBank have accumulated substantial foreign business.US investment banks have for decades followed their corporate clientsabroad; 1996 may be the year when the revolution in delivery systemswill enable their retail brothers to begin to emulate them in selectedmarkets and sectors.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

NYCE'sannouncement in late December follows a year of new home bankinglaunches by some 30 large banks, most of which are using personalfinance manager home banking packages from Microsoft and Intuit as ahome banking interface. In addition, Chicago-based regional ATM networkCash Station has recently announced an outsourcing alliance withprocessor EDS for the provision of home banking services.NYCE, which is based in Hackensack, New Jersey, plans to build its ownhome banking processing platform within the NYCE processing system,which will support home banking and bill payment transactions conductedover touch-tone phones. Calling its approach "home banking `lite'",NYCE will offer a low-cost plain-vanilla home banking service forcustomers who do not need advanced graphical and consultative functionsthat PC personal finance manager (PFM) software packages now provide.But NYCE's system will also accommodate more sophisticated PFM- drivenhome banking programs now offered by many large US banks. NYCE alsoplans to pursue state-of-the-art home banking features, like electronicpresentment, which would allow utilities to deliver billselectronically, as well as alliances with other financial servicesproviders like insurance firms.NYCE's technical platform will be based on Tandem fault-tolerantprocessing hardware, similar to the system NYCE now uses to run itscore ATM and POS networks, which processed some 350 milliontransactions in 1995. Vicorp, a Connecticut-based technology provider,has already installed "device-independent" software that will manageinteractions, via telephone, screenphones, ATMs and PCs.The payments infrastructure and experience of regional networks likeNYCE may allow them to offer more cost-efficient services to smallerinstitutions, with start-up costs as low as $10,000. Intuit hasrecently announced its intention to team up with regional networks toprovide smaller institutions with affordable home banking services. Forits part, NYCE has begun negotiations intended to bring on otherregional networks as equity partners into its new home banking venture.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996BANK INSURANCE REFORM STYMIEDAN IMPASSE over new bank insurance legislation has all but killedprospects for repeal in 1996 of the Glass Steagall Act, the legislationwhich imposed "fire walls" between the US commercial banking andsecurities industries in 1933. Although an agreement is still possible,repeated attempts to bridge the conflicting interests of the commercialbanking and insurance agents' lobbies failed in 1995, as they did in1991, leaving further deregulation of US bank insurance in theuncertain hands of courts and regulators. The result may be that, whilethe Supreme Court and the Office of the Controller of the Currency(OCC) may achieve some piecemeal deregulation of US bank insurance inthe next few years, US banks will still have to cope with a complex anddifficult regulatory climate.In December, House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach floated a newamendment that would strip the "retirement CD" of federal depositinsurance, which insurers are demanding, if they would agree to abideby the upcoming decision by the Supreme Court on the right of BarnettBanks to sell insurance nationally. If Barnett won, all banks would beable to follow its example, but if Barnett lost, Congress would imposea five-year moratorium on the expansion of US bank insurance powers.Both the American Bankers Association and the Independent InsuranceAgents of America opposed Leach's latest compromise.The Supreme Court's decision on Barnett - which is expected this spring- could lead to significant deregulation in its own right. The court iswidely expected to uphold Barnett's right to sell insurance nationallyfrom small towns of under 5,000, owing to a peculiar "small-townexemption" found in the US Banking Act of 1865. But US bank insurancewould still be regulated at the state level, where local insurancelobbies are extremely influential. A favourable Supreme Court decisioncould also spur the OCC to extend national bank insurance powers beyondannuities the OCC sanctioned in 1991, to life and other insuranceproducts.Largest US Retail Banks end of 1994 and 1995 (assets in $billions)end of 1994                       end of 1995 1.

The deals highlighted the rapidconsolidation of the US banking industry. Five years ago, five majorinstitutions vied for market share in New England, but today just twobanks dominate the region. Fleet and Bank of Boston now control a thirdof all deposits in New England, and account for 37 percent of depositsin Massachusetts and 55 percent in the Boston metropolitan area.The two deals brought the total value of 1995 US banking mergers andacquisitions to $73.2 billion, more than the totals for the threeprevious years combined, according to SNL Securities inCharlottesville, Virginia. As a result of 1995 merger activity, thecombined assets of the top 10 US retail banks increased 23 percent to$1.6 trillion (see chart). The top ten 1995 deals, which involved suchinstitutions as Chase Manhattan, First Union and First Chicago, werevalued at $47.5 billion, or nearly two- thirds the year's total.Analysts listed three developments which drove 1995's merger boom:national banking and branching legislation passed in 1994, flatindustry revenues which spurred large players to pursue technology-driven consolidation, and a bull stock market which boosted bank sharesand allowed banks to pay for acquisitions with their own stock. Allthree factors are still very much in force, and analysts expect bankmergers to continue, especially as large acquiring institutions likeNationsBank and Bank of America enter the merger arena.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The deal will also balance the international businesses of Bankof Boston, a quarter of whose revenue now comes from volatile LatinAmerica, with an expanded US regional retail franchise.In an unusual move, all Bank of Boston retail branches will now use thename of BayBanks, which Bank of Boston chief executive Charles Giffordcalled "the top consumer bank in the country", while the holdingcompany, with its commercial and foreign subsidiaries, will use theBank of Boston name. BayBanks' chairman, William Crozier, will becomeBank of Boston's chairman and will continue to direct retail operationsuntil his retirement in 1998, while Gifford will become chief executiveof the new institution.Bank of Boston said that the acquisition, which is priced at 2.2 timesBayBanks' book value, will save $190 million in expenses, or 11 percentof the two banks' combined cost base. Bank of Boston, which will take aone-time restructuring charge of $140 million, expects to see $50million in additional annual revenue, or 7.7 percent of currentearnings, after 18 months. The merger will eliminate some 2,000 jobs,or 8 percent of the banks' combined work force, half by attrition andhalf by lay-offs.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

While manyanalysts praised the deal's geographic logic and its low price of 1.1times book value, others questioned Fleet's ability to absorb NatWestfollowing its acquisition in early 1995 of Shawmut National and its $36billion in assets (see RBI 321). Fleet will now become the ninth-largest US commercial bank with $90 billion in assets.National Westminster had originally put its US unit up for auction inSeptember, asking $4 billion in cash, a difficult hurdle for US banks,which almost always finance large acquisitions with stock. Fleet solvedthis problem with an unusual deal structure: Fleet will pay $2.7billion in cash up front, and another $560 million in "earn-out" fromNatWest New York's revenues over the next eight years. Fleet will alsoissue $600 million in preferred stock, half of which will go toNational Westminster, and $400 million in debt securities.The deal marks the end of National Westminster's 25-year attempt toestablish a beachhead in the volatile US banking market. Before thedeal, NatWest Bancorp had become the largest foreign- owned commercialbank in the US, with $31.1 billion in assets ($13 billion of which willbe sold by Fleet to finance the acquisition). But the bank failed tocreate sufficient scale, and blundered into buying several New Jerseybanks before the US real estate market collapse in the early 1990s.National Westminster ended by spending a total of $3.3 billion buyingits US franchise and then bailing out its loan losses. NationalWestminster is expected to use the cash from the sale to acquire a USasset management firm.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The "mixed channel users"are the least profitable group, representing 50 percent of all retailaccounts but only 20 percent of retail profits."We had better be careful in any attempts to radically downsize thebranch system," First Manhattan president James McCormick told anaudience of retail bankers at the recent Retail Delivery Systemsconference in Atlanta. The branch system continues to offer commercialbanks a strategic stronghold in their struggle against non-banks, hesaid.McCormick noted that "mixed-channel" users are the toughest to serveprofitably, and that the best solution is to push these customerstoward remote systems in a way that assures that"self- servicesubstitutes for branches, not complements them". A number of USinstitutions, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Keycorp, havepursued this goal by offering low-cost ATM accounts to customers whoagree to use only remote media for routine transactions. But McCormicksaid this approach should be evaluated carefully, lest banks forfeitvaluable transaction revenue.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996THE BENCHMARKING IMPERATIVERichard McManus explains the rationale behind benchmarking and suggeststhat bankers have much to learn from both within and outside theirindustryRETAIL BANKS facing increased competition from both traditional and newrivals are looking for methods to improve the value proposition thatthey present to current and prospective customers. As competitionratchets up those that do not keep pace are doomed. Discriminatingcustomers will take flight, opting for providers that devise productand service combinations which more closely match requirements.In an increasingly competitive environment it is crucial to have aclear vision of the future and a sure touch in managing change.Benchmarking can help in both regards if it is properly undertaken.It helps an organisation shape its future strategy and build necessarycapabilities on the basis of an understanding of what has worked forother successful organisations. It involves learning from theexperience of others, rather than solely by doing and making one's ownmistakes.`Piggy-backing' on the success of others makes particular sense whenagility gives an edge in the marketplace. Customers spoilt for choiceare demanding, and winning their support is the aim of each marketparticipant. But with the pace of change increasing `time-to-market'also matters. And to create motivating customer propositions morequickly there is merit in systematically trawling for best practiceboth within and outside the financial services sector.Benchmarking can support step-change improvements in the customer valueproposition. One of the most significant barriers to innovation is pastsuccess. This gives rise to organisational arrogance which takes theform "we always do things in such and such a way" or "we know best".Innovative ideas may be dismissed with an assertion that currentsuccess confirms there is no need to change. Or, equally, inflexibleemployees may suggest a new approach `invented elsewhere' simply willnot work.Benchmarking, at the activity level, can highlight organisationalarrogance. But, at the same time, it can kick-start innovation bygenerating concrete examples of best practice. Such examples showinnovation to be the prerequisite of survival rather than unnecessaryor infeasible.Retail banks committed to learning from others can look for creativeapproaches which build customer value advantages vis-a- vis competitionwithout sacrificing speed. The senior management team, armed with anacute appreciation of evolving customer needs and changing competitorcapabilities, should seek out proven approaches which can be adapted.The customer-driven retail bank cannot afford either to stand still orwaste time re-inventing the wheel.Inevitable popularityIt is not surprising that businesses `catch the benchmarking bug' incompetitive marketplaces. In essence, properly undertaken benchmarkinggives senior management the wherewithal to overcome organisationalinertia. It entails the adaptation of demonstrable success to sustain acustomer proposition which is preferred over and above the alternativesoffered by local competition. It generates information which helpsmanagement improve customer value and create defensible advantage.Benchmarking output is, therefore, an essential raw material ofsuccessful competitive strategy. And in an increasingly internationalmarketplace the scope of a benchmarking study must be global.In Strategic Benchmarking, Gregory Watson has charted the evolution ofbenchmarking as a developing science. He argues that there are fivegenerations.In the `first generation' it is nothing more than reverse engineering.This reflects the fact that benchmarking became popular initially inthe fields of civil engineering and computer hardware and software. Thechallenge was to better the functionality offered by a competitorproduct.In the `second generation' `competitive benchmarking' involves movingbeyond product-oriented examples to include comparisons of theprocesses that lie behind the products. The point is that a successfulcompetitor needs to know both what the market requires and how toprovide it cost effectively.In the `third generation' `process benchmarking' represents a naturalprogression. Enlightened organisations come to realise that the how isoften more important than the what. Product innovation can givecompetitive advantage but this can be easily and rapidly copied. But itis often far more difficult to identify and replicate the processeswhich the innovator has pioneered. These processes are not in thepublic domain.In the `third generation' Watson asserts "quality leaders recognisedthat they could learn more easily from companies outside their industrythan from competitive studies".There are two reasons for this claim. The first is that it is oftendifficult to share information within an industry without promptingconcerns over anti-competitive behaviour or stalemate competition. Thesecond is that information from outside an industry often provides moreinsight because it forces management to think from first principlesrather than implement incremental improvements. In summary, thoselooking outside their immediate industry can expect a willingness toshare information and a freshness of view.In the `fourth generation' `strategic benchmarking' represents afurther increase in sophistication. Watson suggests it is"a systematicprocess for evaluating alternatives, implementing strategies andimproving performance by understanding and adapting strategies fromexternal partners who participate in an ongoing business alliance".In essence, it involves a commitment to learn how the business can bere-engineered to support better customer value propositions. It entailsroot and branch change rather than minor improvement and, as a result,it is likely to give a competitive edge.Watson argues that the `fifth generation' will be `globalbenchmarking'. This will entail businesses scouring the world for bestpractices which can valuably be applied to improve their own customervalue propositions. Leading-edge businesses already adopt thisapproach.In planning a global consumer financial services strategy a few yearsago, GE Capital decided to benchmark (among others) American Express,Citicorp, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, MasterCard, Barclays Bank and AIG. Thepoint is that a parochial perspective leaves an institution vulnerable.It is ill-prepared for competition from powerful traditional and non-traditional rivals in other geographic areas.The popularity of benchmarking today probably in part reflects the wayin which this practice has evolved. In Watson's `first generation' itrepresents nothing more than straightforward competitor analysis. Andno business in a competitive marketplace can argue against this.But by the `fifth generation' benchmarking has become something quitedifferent. It is all about trawling internationally to establish whichbest practices will underpin motivating customer propositions. It takesaccount of the fact that customers are the arbiters of commercialsuccess. And it recognises that a parochial orientation will not promptnecessary innovation.In spite of the way in which benchmarking has evolved, however, therecan be no doubt that even institutions new to the practice need to cometo terms with the fifth generation. It is futile to plan a gradualmigration from first to fifth generation behaviour. An institutionfollowing this course in a competitive market will not survive longenough to complete it.Activities and ProcessesBenchmarking is predicated upon the notion that all businesses,including the retail banking business, can be broken down into a seriesof activities and processes. This is significant for two reasons. Thefirst is that some activities and processes, are more important thanothers. The second is that comparative measurement both within andoutside an industry sector is possible at this level.The critical activities and processes are those that add most customervalue. Superiority in undertaking these will lead to significantcomparative advantage in a competitive marketplace. And an organisationlearning from international best practice at the activity and processlevel will be capable of world class performance.So what are the activities and processes that make up the retailbanking business? One possible diagrammatic representation of theactivities is shown in Figure 2. But the processes that lie behindthese activities are necessarily in a state of flux as customers'tastes change, new technology becomes available and competitorinnovation makes an impact.In the product management area, for example, design and packaging usedto be all that was required. When a competitor came out with a newproduct that met with success in the marketplace others moved quicklyto copy it. But this is where the problem lies.It is impossible to build a worthwhile advantage vis-a-vis competitionwhen emulation is relatively easy. And, to use Watson's terminology, asfirst and second generation benchmarking became prevalent, productmanagement needed to evolve. It is now more a question of targetingparticular customer segments by devising a suitable mix of products.The optimum mix reflects the long-term mission of a retail bank ratherthan the recent market success of a local rival. This is importantbecause it demonstrates that a product range which suits oneinstitution may be completely inappropriate for another which has adifferent customer focus. And as the European enthusiasm for allfinanzspreads throughout the world it is wise to question whether it isnecessary to add insurance to traditional retail banking products.The answer depends on the customer focus and whether the retail bankcommitted to allfinanz is in the vanguard or merely copying successfullocal rivals.In essence, some but not all customers will buy a comprehensive rangeof financial products from one supplier because they lack theconfidence or inclination to shop around. And allfinanz first-moverswill tend to win these customers leaving late converts with theunenviable task of trying to change the buying behaviour of othercustomer segments.Against this backdrop, it must be wise to benchmark product managementin allfinanz first-movers and to review critically the market responseto late converts.So much for product management. The marketing and sales activity issimilarly in a state of flux. In the past, this required little morethan some corporate image work and the dissemination of productinformation. But enlightened retail banks are now making sure theirmarketeers focus on building meaningful customer brands.As previous issues of CEO Confidential have argued this involvespositioning products and services in such a way as to ensure they arepreferred by customers. Effective brands improve profitability becausethe associated benefits of increased market share or superior pricerealisation outweigh the costs of brand creation. It is worth notingthat the most profitable retail banks often achieve this position bycharging high prices. This may reflect an uncompetitive market or themarketeers earning their keep.It seems that marketing and sales will be more about sophisticatedcustomer segmentation and carefully tailored communication in thefuture. The segmentation will compartmentalise customers on the basisof buying behaviour and motivation.It is possible to address such coherent groups in a persuasive waybecause they act and think alike. The marketing and sales initiativeswhich result from this approach are a far cry from the generalcorporate positioning statements on which too many retail bankscurrently rely.When it comes to benchmarking there is no shortage of organisationsthat are committed to sophisticated customer segmentation and theassociated tailored communication. In the finance sector, the creditcard companies embracing affinity group marketing lead the way. But theairline and automotive industries, among others, can also providevaluable insights.Distribution management is probably one of the most critical activitiesfor retail banks today. This reflects the fact that convenience sooften underpins the financial institution selection decision. Andconvenience implies ease of access.In the past, retail banks with a comprehensive branch network werepreferred because branch-based distribution was the norm. Wherealternatives existed either few customer were aware of them or mostwere disinclined to use them. But this is all changing.Direct delivery channels, particularly those using the conventionalphone, are in the ascendancy. And, as traditional retail banks launchtheir telephone banking operations, they legitimise and promote thischange in delivery emphasis. This is all well and good but, in a sense,retail banks with extensive branch networks are playing into the handsof non-bank rivals without a bricks and mortar heritage.This is not to say that turning one's back on direct delivery is arational choice. But the key distribution management issue facingtraditional retail banks is how to ensure a smooth transition from thedelivery emphasis of the past to that suitable in the future.The critical concern for the branch-reliant is how to achieve a highbranch utilisation while focusing attention on new delivery channels.Natural pressure to justify the overhead of new delivery channels canlead to existing customers being encouraged to migrate from branchdelivery. As a result, an unchanged branch overhead becomes moreburdensome. New efficient costs are overlaid on inefficient costs. Butthe net result is a worsening cost position, particularly whencannibalisation is the norm and, therefore, capacity utilisation ineach channel is poor.Against this backdrop it is wise to benchmark those institutions thatprove themselves skilful in both managing capacity utilisation andmatching delivery channel to customer segment.Wells Fargo is an example in the finance sector of a retail bank thathas become more reliant on ATMs and supermarket branches without beingencumbered with the costs of the traditional branch network. But thereare also lessons from other retail businesses.Some department stores have embraced the shop-within-a-shop conceptwhere concessions are given to specialist retailers in order to bolstersales per outlet. Other retailers have built complementary mail orderbusinesses without wholesale outlet closure. And there are examples inthe restaurant and leisure business of one operator running competingconcepts with distinct delivery formats.In the finance sector it is wrong to think about delivery as beingcompletely separate from the product proposition. Quite the reverse isthe case. There must be a fit between the customer segments, theproduct and the delivery channel. But the same is true for other retailconcepts that seek to build a brand image.The delivery approach is an integral part of the brand. And more andmore retail banks will come to realise that different delivery channelsare best targeted at different customer segments.In the long term, it is probable that many will seek to make differentproduct and delivery combinations into distinct brands. They willfollow a trail blazed by businesses in other sectors and as a resultbenchmarking will help.In the customer service area the transition which will be important formost retail banks is from uniform service to customised service. Theemphasis in recent years has been upon introducing and policing higherservice standards. Many banks have recognised that failing to make thegrade in customer service is an unforgivable failing in the servicebusiness. But the desire to improve service has led to inflexible andsometimes inappropriate standards. Service means different things todifferent people and, worse still, it means different things atdifferent times.Bearing in mind this and the cost of service provision the astuteretail bank will strive to match service performance to the customerand the occasion. Those adopting this approach are treating customerservice as a profit rather than a cost centre.From a benchmarking point of view it is likely that in the financialservices sector the direct providers will make the running. They areable to make the notion of the `segment of one' an operational reality.But outside financial services there will be valuable lessons from thehotel, airline and restaurant business. Each of these grapple with theproblem of treating different customers in different ways within thesame delivery channel. And each suffer from the difficulty faced byretail banks where the delivery channel is an integral part of theoverall proposition.In processing and administration the retail bank emphasis is going toshift away from securing back-office efficiency towards tasks whichimprove customer information and facilitate risk management. It is notthat efficiency is a bad thing. It is a prerequisite, but it is alsoinsufficient for success.The challenge facing retail banks is not only to do things efficientlybut to do the right things. And the learning organisation realises thatday-to-day interactions with existing customers can provide a wealth ofinformation to help in customer retention and customer acquisitioninitiatives.Not to put too fine a point on it, failure to build a `feedback loop'from arrears management to marketing is pure folly unless the aim is tokeep the arrears department busy!From a benchmarking point of view it is likely that the credit cardcompanies will pioneer state-of-art processing and administration inthe finance sector. They already ensure that prospective profitabilitydrives marketing initiatives and they are sophisticated in riskmanagement.But outside the finance sector there will be valuable lessons to belearned from direct response marketing companies and the mail orderindustry. And it is possible that government bureaucracies facingpressures to cut costs may also give some pointers to retail banks. Inmany countries the tax authorities, for example, have simplifiedadministrative tasks and shifted much of the burden onto their clients.Those embarking on re-engineering of the back-office should take note.In customer information the retail bank emphasis is going to be upongarnering the information which is necessary for customer segmentationand marketing purposes. This will certainly represent far more thanbasic demographic information and details on who holds which products.Information will include the kind of data which enables a retail bankto cluster customers into groups which are homogenous both in terms ofproducts purchased and motivating factors. And it will involve anassessment of profitability by customer and segment.The key point is that it is such customer information which will helpsenior management determine the long-term strategy for the retail bank.As a result, customer information helps shape the other activitieswhich make up the retail bank and redefine the important processes. Incompany jargon, the organisation becomes customer-driven.From a benchmarking point of view retail banks and credit cardcompanies that have got to the bottom of customer profitability will bewell worth studying. And, as with processing and administration, directresponse marketing companies and the mail order industry will providesome pointers.In conclusionBenchmarking on a global basis provides valuable input to the strategyformulation process. It is not done once and for all but should ratherbe a continuous process. This reflects the fact that rivals willundoubtedly copy success.A key task for senior management is to set for the organisationchallenging objectives that stand the test of time. This involvesstriving for superiority and not purely in those activities andprocesses which have the greatest impact upon customer value. Theemphasis selected will reflect the customer focus, the organisationalheritage and the anticipated competitor approach. The benchmarkingquestions to be answered are quite simply:What do we benchmark?  Who do we benchmark?  How do we act on the basisof benchmarking insight in our organisation?Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Over the pastten years the economy has sustained annual GDP growth of 6 percent.The main consequence of this - the colony's 6 million people growingever wealthier and more middle class - has proved a rich seam for HongKong's retail banks.These banks, which make up around 30 of the 180 licensed banks in HongKong, have enjoyed levels of profitability which their westerncounterparts could only dream of.Banking profits have been sustained even against a background of zeroreal interest rates (the prime rate of 9 percent remains identical tolast year's annual inflation) and narrow spreads.But as 1997 looms large, uncertainty over Chinese intentions is havinga damaging and uncertain effect on the market. A report to be publishedlater this month by the Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts thatgrowth will fall dramatically from 4.5 percent in 1995 to 3.5 percentthis year and just 1.7 percent in 1997.This could prove damaging for retail banks which, so far, have managedto avoid large-scale branch closures and panic consolidation which nowso pre-occupies western banks. It may also bring with it bad customers - a rarity in Hong Kong where getting into financial difficultiesinvolves Chinese "loss of face".Alex Au, vice chairman and chief executive of Hang Seng Bank, thesecond largest locally incorporated bank with 138 branches, recognisesthe problem."The general impression in Hong Kong is that the industry is confrontedby a less favourable trading environment," he says. "The feeling isthat a period of high growth has passed and that a period ofconsolidation will follow. But let's not forget that, although growthmay be slowing in the industry, banks in Hong Kong are still among themost profitable in the world."If ever the idea meeteth the man then retail banking and the people ofHong Kong are one of life's happy coincidences. Unlike in the west,where single bank relationships are the norm, Hong Kong residents haveon average 2.4 accounts in 1.9 banks. This is a territory in which evenlittle old ladies play the currency markets with their nest egg andexpect their bank to provide them with foreign exchange depositaccounts with which they can swap currencies at a whim.Another headache for the banks is the almost frenetic use of the systemby individual customers. The Hongkong Bank estimates its customersinteract with it on average an astonishing 16 times a month.The precise size of the retail banking market is difficult to gauge,but $HK 2.1 trillion ($290 billion) is held as deposits with licensedbanks of which savings deposits comprise $HK 418 billion and currentaccounts just $HK 115 billion.Current accounts play a relatively insignificant role in Hong Kongretail banking with banks regarding deposit accounts and mortgages asthe core product on which to initiate a relationship with a customer.The newspapers, both Chinese and English, are full of advertisementsfor the latest interest rates on deposit account and mortgage products."What you want is someone to come in and take a mortgage from you. Youhave then got them for at least nine or ten years," says David K.P. Li,deputy chairman and chief executive of the Bank of East Asia."They would typically be a young couple in their late 20s or early 30sborrowing between $HK1.5 million and $HK1.8 million to buy a 900 squarefoot apartment, the repayments on which would set them back around 60percent of their income. You can then sell them decoration loans,credit cars, overdrafts and help them with hire purchase for a car," headds.Ironically, in a city brimming with local entrepreneurial talent, themain product innovators in Hong Kong retail banking are the foreignbanks.Inextricably linked to the colony, Hongkong Bank and Standard Charteredwear thin the definition of foreign, but they dominate the market alongwith Citibank and the Hang Seng Bank, the latter part of the HongkongBank since the mid-1960s but separately listed and, perhaps to a lesserdegree, the Bank of East Asia.They have led the way with smart cards, foreign currency depositaccounts (targeted at mid-range customers in Hong Kong) and tax loans,a very popular product in a territory where there is no PAYE.This is something readily conceded by smaller local banks such as theDah Sing Bank, a traditional trade finance bank which only moved intoretail in the last few years."Basically, I would agree that the bigger foreign banks have dominatedthe market. It has been difficult for the smaller banks because of lackof resources and the cost of technology, but I sense that things arebeginning to change," says Derek Wong, Dah Sing's head of retail.A yet to be proven catalyst to greater competition could be the slowbut still partial demise of the Hong Kong interest rate cartel whichbegan two years ago.Under the cartel, all deposit interest rates used to be fixed weekly bythe Hong Kong Association of Banks. In October 1994 time deposits fixedfor more than one month were deregulated and in January last year itwas left to individual banks to set their rates for deposits over sevendays.The larger banks remain unhappy about the break-up. According to recentanalysis, it has led to a 5 percent drop in deposits as a result offalling interest rates.Hang Seng's Au is worried it has created another uncertainty in the run-up to 1997. "Although the industry is not against deregulation there isa concern it has affected bank profitability and that some banks maycompensate by writing more risky loans," he says.The smaller players believe it has brought much needed competition tothe market, allowing them to buy market share by setting their owninterest rates."The status quo ante made no sense really. Deregulation offers moreopportunity to the medium-sized banks. We can offer lower interestrates as a way of competing against the bigger players. I believe wecan also react faster than the local banks," says Sergio Rial, theBrazilian general manager of Dutch bank ABN AMRO in Hong Kong.Western banks have a lot to learn from the luxurious and airy design ofmany of the branches in Hong Kong. In a place where land is moreexpensive than anywhere else in the world there is no point in buildinga shed. Customers too are treated with great courtesy in the banks,something not typical in the retail business across the whole of HongKong."In the UK if you go into a branch to make a transaction, say deposit acheque, all you will get is a stamped stub. It astonishes me how peoplewill deposit large sums of money and virtually have no proof of doingso. In Hong Kong, the customer will get a printed out receipt preciselyrecording the transaction," says Eric Tai, senior executive, retail,marketing and planning, Hongkong Bank.The ATM is king in Hong Kong with many more machines per 10,000 of thepopulation than in the US or the UK. You cannot, in fact, pass an ATMin Hong Kong without seeing a large gathering of people, many seeminglynot queuing to use it, but perhaps taking time out to worship Mammon,surely Hong Kong's truest god. Customers not only draw money out atATMs but also pay their utility bills with the use of a swipe card.The love of gadgetry of all kinds would seemingly make Hong Kong ripefor a direct banking revolution. The fall-off in economic growth wouldalso seem to necessitate that the banks move faster towards automationin order to cut costs and retain profit margins. Yet Hong Kong's movestowards direct delivery are perhaps more primitive than their westerncounterparts.The leading banks have offered telephone banking since 1990 but it isstill very much an in-branch service. The nearest one gets to a UK-style First Direct operation is a voice response computer at the otherend of the line.A key reason why the direct banking has not swept the colony is theproblem of getting phone operatives in a land of virtually fullemployment.As Sergio Rial of ABN AMRO explains: "The real barrier to telephonebanking developing in Hong Kong is that professional people don't wantto sit behind a phone all day and in this place they have a right tochoose. Skilled people want to do creative jobs, not pay people'sutility bills and check passwords," he says. "It is one of those thingsthat has not really caught on and it is presenting real difficultiesfor the banks."I think what will happen here is that there will be a sudden quantumleap from ordinary branch banking to PC home-based banking, largely by-passing the telephone banking stage. This will satisfy the enthusiasmfor gadgetry among Hong Kong people and solve the cost headache for thebanks."Citibank insists its telephone banking operation has been a successwith its customers. "We have achieved 90 percent satisfaction from ourcustomers compared to 82 percent from our normal branch bankingbusiness," says Peter Wong, the bank's vice president of globalconsumer banking in Hong Kong.Many of the banks have not as yet embarked on major branch closureprogrammes. Hongkong Bank has closed just 20 in the last two yearsbringing its total down to 220; the Dah Sing Bank has reduced itsnumber over the same period from 53 to 43; Citibank has closed mainlysmaller branches, and most of the other banks have only made limitedcutbacks.There have, however, been moves to segment the market by developingspecific branches for different categories of customers.The most marked move in this direction has come from the Hongkong Bank,which now has three different types of branches - select branches forupmarket customers, standard branches for regular customers and day andnight automated branches."Competition for profitable retail customers in the territory hasrarely been keener. We have responded by introducing a strategy thatinvolves segmenting the way we serve the market," says Hongkong's EricTai. "The select branches will guarantee that we can provide our valuedupmarket customers with the highest quality of service."The Bank of East Asia services its upmarket customers by deliveringservices direct to a customer's office or home. "It is a far moresubtle way of dealing with major clients and, I believe, just aseffective," says Dr Li.One of the most controversial aspects of banking in Hong Kong is thestranglehold the larger banks have over the Hong Kong Association ofBanks (HKAB).It is chaired in rotation by Standard Chartered, Hongkong Bank and nowthe Bank of China (which began its first term of office this year).Many other banks have restricted rights of membership to its committeeand yet the HKAB is all powerful, still setting regulated interestrates, policing the system and acting as a clearing house.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the supposed central bank, does noteven issue notes (still done by the major banks) and is not even abanker to the Government.Dr Li, who apart from running the Bank of East Asia is the solefinancial institution representative on the colony's main law makingbody, the Legislative Council or Legco, insists the system must change."The whole system is very colonial. It is what Singapore was like 45years ago. The Hong Kong Association of Banks is an old boys' club withthe chairmanship running between three banks," he says. "The GovernorChris Patten talks about democracy, but we have one of the mostundemocratic institutions on our own doorstep. The whole systemencourages `yes' people. I certainly thought the cartel worked againstthe interests of the consumer."It is a view echoed by Peter Wong, banking director of Citibank, whichdoes not always get its own seat on the HKBA committee: "It is not alevel playing field. The HKBA should incorporate more players so theflow of information can be better."Li also insists that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation isstill the lender of last resort and, as such, exerts too much controlover the system. He wants the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to assumethat role officially."The colony must have an official lender of last resort. At present,the smaller banks may have a credit line of say $HK30 million from theHongkong Bank and if it exceeds that it may get charged 3 percent aboveprime which is very steep," he says.Hong Kong unlike other banking centres has not yet seen a period ofmajor consolidation between banks.The main highlights have been the purchase by the Dah Sing Bank of theHong Kong Industrial and Commercial Bank from the Hong Kong governmentand then three years ago its acquisition of the Wingon bank from theHang Seng Bank. The Dao Heng, the third largest local bank, bought theHang Lung Bank in 1989 and the Overseas Trust Bank in 1993.Opinion is divided as to whether harsher economic conditions will leadto a spate of more substantial mergers. Dr Li again: "I think consolidation will come. I think there are twoor three banks here that would benefit from merger, although I believethere is a cultural resistance to it. A lot of the local banks arefamily controlled and Chinese people don't like to lose face by seeingtheir family's heritage being taken over."Banks, which have stayed clear of retail for generations, are nowmoving into the market.The Dah Sing Bank, traditionally a trade finance bank, has come up withsome of the most aggressive retail products in the marketplace.One is a credit card which has a generous cash bonus point scheme thateffectively reduces the monthly rate of interest on borrowings to 1.5percent, significantly less than the 2 percent to 2.5 percent marketaverage.Competitors say the card has flopped and is losing money, somethingwhich Derek Wong head of retail denies. "We have built up a lot ofbusiness over the past 18 months with this card. We had a lot ofinitial free advertising because it was such a revolutionary newproduct," he says.ABN AMRO, one of the oldest established international banks in HongKong, has also been a late entrant to retail, although it is perhapsthe first non-British European bank to do so. It has also gone in hardon price undercutting other banks, particularly in mortgages.General manager Rial insists the strategy has worked, claiming thatretail banking had grown from nil to 30 percent of profits of the bankin Hong Kong in three years: "It has proved to be a very good move. Wehave a leaner structure than many of the other banks and we do not havethe costs of a large staff branch network. We are also an AA bank, sowe can fund ourselves better than many of our competitors," he says.But the biggest issue in Hong Kong retail banking as in the colony as awhole has to be 1997. It creates an uncertainty that perhaps only afinancial centre as strong as Hong Kong could withstand. There is afeeling in the banking community that those who were going to leavehave left and that capital outflows over the coming 18 months will notbe that significant."The current situation is no good for business. The name- callingbetween the various political interest groups only makes peoplenervous. It will be better when the 1997 deadline passes," saysRandolph Sullivan, managing director, Dao Heng Bank.And ABN AMRO's Rial believes stories of Hong Kong's death as afinancial centre have been greatly exaggerated."Shanghai will notreplace Hong Kong as a regional financial centre in my lifetime atleast. To be a financial centre, the market has to accept that you area financial centre and whole infrastructure and framework has to bethere. Hong Kong will continue to be pivotal in Asia," he adds.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996BANKING ON THE LONG HAULEric Tai, senior executive, retail marketing and planning with HongkongBank speaks to Andrew MoodyERIC TAI is senior executive, retail, marketing and planning forHongkong Bank, the leading international bank in Asia outside of Japan.It has 500 offices in 19 countries in Asia and boasts one of thelargest global proprietary ATM networks in the world with 170,000machines. The bank's earnings have expanded by a compound rate of 22percent over the past 25 years. Tai began his career in insurance andhad a spell working for Commercial Union in the UK. Before joiningHongkong Bank, he worked for Citibank and ANZ.RBI: Retail banking margins in many countries in the west are now verynarrow and there are pressures to cross-sell higher margin products.Are there similar pressures in Hong Kong?Eric Tai: Retail banking is more profitable in Hong Kong than in theUK, for example, on virtually every ratio you want to talk about. Thisis partly to do with serving a smaller geographical area and havingcustomers with a higher savings ratio, around 30 percent compared to 9percent in the UK. This means you can do things in a more costeffective way without the same pressures to cross-sell.But although we are not driven to sell other products to supplement ourretail banking income we do so because people want to buy theseproducts from the banks, which they trust. The fact that we also makemoney out of this is just a win-win situation. We are moving intoderivative products and we have just launched a universal life productwhich we haven't sold before.RBI: Why is banking in Hong Kong so profitable?ET: It is not because of margins, which are actually narrower than inthe UK or US. Rather, it is lucrative because of Hong Kong's huge tradeflows, because GDP has grown at 7 percent annually since 1980 andbecause Hong Kong is the world's largest forex centre and seventhlargest stockmarket. Per capita income now exceeds that of Europe. Andvery, very few bank loans go bad.RBI: Which product do you have to sell a customer in Hong Kong in orderto build a long-term relationship?ET: We don't have the situation in the UK or the US where everyone ischasing the cheque account. The market is very different here and theyare not something we chase, although they are free funds. We havepeople with heaps of money who don't have cheque accounts.The coat hanger product and the one we chase is the deposit accountand, to some extent, AssetVantage and PowerVantage. These lock thecustomer in on a much more all-round basis than mere transactionalbanking. Our strategy works in that we have a relationship with 60percent to 70 percent of the bankable population.RBI: What is your view of the partial break up of the Hong Konginterest rate cartel?ET: It has certainly put more pressure on margins and has freed upcompetitive forces in the marketplace. It has added extra uncertaintyin the marketplace and reduced the predictability and stability of theeconomy in the run-up to 1997.RBI: A number of your rivals are trying to compete heavily on price.How are you responding to this?ET: The deposit interest rates offered by some of our competitors couldsometimes be as much as 20 percent higher than ours. There has beensome market buying and market share purchasing, but we have nointention of being a price driver.We do a lot of things sufficiently well to reduce the impact of thisand segmenting the market is also a way of coping with the competition.RBI: How much emphasis has Hongkong Bank placed on providing directbanking services to its customers?ET: We have been in direct banking since 1990 in one form or another.We can do telephone, we can do fax. We are not doing home banking yetbut we are coming along with it. We are currently working with HongkongTelecom jointly to do TV banking. All the different interfaces whichare possible technologically are being looked at to find the most costeffective and most customer receptive forms of direct banking toimplement.Most banks in Hong Kong have some direct banking offer but it is stilloffered within the bank itself rather than by setting up a separateentity such as First Direct.RBI: Has the move towards direct banking been driven by costconsiderations?ET: Retail banks, like all businesses, in Hong Kong, face staffshortages. Unemployment has held steady at under 3 percent for years,which has led to a steady rise in personnel costs. At Hongkong Bank,with our big branch network, the staff shortage has been so acute atlower levels that we now employ several hundred bank tellers fromChina.The positive aspect of this staff shortage is that we have been forcedto introduce a high level of technology in our branches. We have put inplace machines that automatically provide up-to- date balances onpassbooks, as well as automatic deposit machines which count acustomer's cash deposit and credit it instantly to his or her account.RBI: Hongkong Bank has taken the somewhat unique step of creating threedistinct types of branches for different grades of customer. What isthe logic behind this?ET: We believe creating three distinct type of branches is the bestmethod of delivering the right products and services to the rightcustomers. So we have what we call select branches for our high gradecustomers, standard branches, which are just normal branches, andautomated branches, which operate day and night.To be a customer at a select branch you have to be invited by a branchmanager or be a user of a particular product. The automated branchescurrently have two people in them and with more investment intechnology they will be taken out.A product which would gain you access to a select branch isAssetVantage, which is a bundled collection of products sold as a half-way point to private banking. This is similar to first class service onan airline. You need to have a minimum deposit of $HK200,000 ($25,900)and for this you are able to have savings accounts in 30 differentcurrencies and also gold trade.We have also launched PowerVantage which is more like business class.It is intended for younger high-earning customers. We have alsolaunched a special kind of account aimed at small business operatorscalled BusinessVantage.Although we segment the market, however, banking is banking is bankingand you can't really offer a significantly different service to onecustomer compared to another.Banking in Hong Kong is often a social activity and since you areoffered coffee and chocolates at the select branches people often bringtheir friends to the bank to do their transactions.RBI: Are you pandering to the notion that banking in Hong Kong is tiedup with status?ET: I have a very good friend in the UK and he says to me that hecannot stand the high street banks because they don't look after him.They don't treat him as someone special and this is something we try toavoid here.RBI: What pressures are there on you to close branches and reducestaffing to rationalise costs?ET: We have streamlined branches from around 240 two years ago to 220now. We will continue to look at cutting the number of branches, butthe actual network remains unchanged.Essentially what we have done is to close some of the smaller branchesand consolidate the bigger branches. Some of the closures have beenmade for safety reasons because we had a fire in one of our branchesand needed improved safety facilities.We are reducing staffing by using more part-timers so we have theappropriate number of staff in the branches according to how busy weare. The more flexible use of people has enabled us to cut staff costssignificantly. We want to find more efficient ways of doing things but,at the same time, we don't want to reduce the service we provide tocustomers. In fact, we set a minimum service standard for a particularproduct and work to those benchmarks continually checking our customersatisfaction levels.RBI: How much pressure comes from the fact that bank customers usetheir banks more regularly in Hong Kong than in other parts of theworld?ET: Yes, essentially it does. It puts a lot of peak load requirement onour network, particularly when salaries and social security are paidinto customer accounts.We have customers in our mid-market sector who will interface with thebank up to 16 times a month, which is more or less every day, if youignore the weekend. The number of transactional interfaces is indeed aproblem and we can only deal with it by having efficient systems.RBI: How big an impact do you think 1997 will have on the retailbanking market in Hong Kong?ET: As far as we are concerned we are here for the long haul. If wedidn't believe in China we would not be opening branches there. Thechange of sovereignty will naturally have some effect. But I think thepotential is still there to carry on doing business the way we thinkbest. If some of our customers decide to place their money abroad thenwe hope our global network will capture some of it.RBI: How much Chinese money is coming into Hong Kong?ET: Heaps. We estimate that China has invested $US20 billion in theterritory.RBI: How much benefit have you derived from the link up with Midland inthe UK?ET: I believe it has added to our global presence. These things areoften difficult to quantify. Our customers, however, now have access toATM machines in the UK, which can often be very useful.RBI: How much competition do you face from non-banks?ET: This is certainly on the increase. It is a big issue for us.Property developers and retailers are providing their own credit cards.I think if we don't take them seriously they will become big.RBI: What is your view of the Hong Kong economy?ET: It has come off since the property boom of 1993/94 which generateda lot of income. The credit squeeze in China to reduce inflation therefrom 30 percent to around 20 percent has had some effect over the past12 to 18 months. US demand for Hong Kong goods has also subsided. Theseseem to be the main factors behind the fall off in growth.RBI: How much of a presence do you have in other Asian countries?ET: The bank's greatest success is in Hong Kong itself but we do have asignificant presence in other countries in the region. We are thelargest foreign bank in Singapore, where we play a role in running thecheque clearing system. We also have a key presence in India, where wehave 21 branches.We are constrained from expanding in many countries but have beenhelped recently by market liberalisation. In the Philippines, we aretaking advantage of this and are expanding our network from two toeight branches. We have also been allowed to add two new facilities inThailand and are growing steadily in Indonesia.Indochina is becoming increasingly important for us. We have justopened an office in Burma and are in the process of upgrading our repoffice in Ho Chi Minh City to a branch.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Unless bankers are proactive and cooperate with regulators now tosolve issues, such as whether chip-card transactions are cash or checkexchanges, "it will be decided when a member of Congress loses a chipcard or stored value card with $1,000 on it," warned Karen Petrou,president of ISD/Shaw Inc. consultancy in Washington, D.C.     Although the industry ignored legislators last year, when askedfor suggestions about regulating electronic banking, a few rulings,opinions and real life experiences exist to guide you.SFNB Operates Within Existing Law     Banks could copy Security First Network Bank (SFNB) of Pineville,Ky., without a major investment in regulatory applications orchallenges, said Stuart Stein, a partner in the financial institutionspractice group with Hogan & Hartson law firm in Washington, D.C. Stein's firm advises SFNB on banking law applicable to its newbusiness strategies.     SFNB found that it could be the first to offer Internet bankingwithout applying for a new charter or filing a separate FederalReserve application, he said.     Initially, Cardinal BancShares, SFNB's parent company, receivedapproval to consolidate and sell five branches to spin-off SFNB.  Butit did not need Regulation Y approval from the Federal Reserve.  Reg Yapplies to bank and non-bank holding company expansion, Steinexplained.     After the spinoff, SFNB changed its business from traditionalthrift activities to soliciting deposits and purchasing loans over theInternet, Stein said.  The bank opened its Internet doors last yearand recently expanded its offerings to include joint checkingaccounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposits and checkimaging to view cleared checks on-line (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 3.)     The next step for SFNB may require more regulatory involvement. The bank plans to buy Five Paces Software and then license thetechnology platform on which SFNB was built, Stein said.  Licensingthis technology to other banks likely will be considered a newbusiness practice for SFNB, which will require Federal DepositInsurance Corporation and Office of Thrift Supervision approval, headded.     The Five Paces technology, which includes a secure operatingsystem that resides at the bank, was created for SFNB by WebTech Inc. of Atlanta, an affiliate of Atlanta-based SecureWare.      SFNB is not alone in its strategy.  Several banks joined lastyear to buy Meca Software from H&R Block and plan to license Mec' homebanking program to other banks.Two Agencies Publish Rules     Clearly, the SFNB experience shows that banks can deliver anypreviously offered service electronically without receiving anyregulatory grief.  But two agencies have published opinions and ruleson electronic banking regulation.     The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published a rules'revision Feb. 9 supporting activities, such as those proposed by SFNBand Meca.  The revision of part 7 of the OCC regulations states thatbanks may market technology they acquired or developed for bankingpurposes to third parties, said Julie Williams, chief OCC counsel (seebox, p. 3).     The FDIC recently released two letters written in Octoberaddressing a bank's questions about Internet banking deposit insuranceand the possible deposit broker role of third-party vendors.  Theopinions can be applied to the industry as a whole.     One letter addresses customer funds transferred to an accountestablished at a bank by the sponsoring company to facilitate Internettransactions.  The FDIC said that federal deposit insurance would flowthrough to funds deposited in a third-party agency account with theinsured institution.  Insurance flows through if the companysufficiently disclosed the capacities in which money was transmittedto it by customers and that the company maintained adequate recordsindicating the identity of customers for which it held funds.     This approach appears to differ significantly from the approachused by Mark Twain Bank in its DigiCash trial.  In that system, fundsare deposited directly with the bank into an insured account.  Themoney becomes uninsured when withdrawn and placed into the bank's e-cash mint, or transferred onto the hard drive of a customer'scomputer, said Thomas Vartanian, managing partner of the Washington,D.C. law office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.     The second FDIC letter concludes that a sponsoring company orthird-party vendor in an Internet funds transfer program would not bea deposit broker.     That opinion was based on the fact that the company's "primarypurpose" was the provision of electronic payment system, rather thanthe placement of funds with a depository institution.  Since nointerest was being paid on the agency account, the FDIC obviouslyunderstood that the safety and soundness concerns articulated bySection 29 of the FDI Act were not applicable in this case, Vartaniansaid.    Be aware, though, that the main exclusion for this FDIC ruling,"primary purpose," is considered on a case-by-case basis.  The FDICconsiders the following key characteristics when asked if an agency isa deposit broker:*   Fees.  Does the party receive fees from the bank for placing fundswith the institution?*  Purpose.  Would the relationship have been established but for thepurpose for placing funds in the bank?*   Other Reasons.  Is there any other substantial purpose for theactivity or business other than the placement of funds in the insuredinstitution?Think About Product First    "Regulatory analysis can vary depending on what you're talkingabout," said Scott Anenberg, partner and chair of the financialinstitutions group at the Washington, D.C., law firm Shaw, Pittman,Potts and Trowbridge.  Legal issues differ whether you're just takingdeposits or doing loans over the Internet, he said.    Decide what the product is, how it will be offered, who will beoffering it and who is the target market before investigatingregulatory options, Anenberg said.    Also, speakers said, consider the competition, which may notalways be another bank.  In the smart card market, for example,Florida-based Blockbuster Entertainment Group  [VIA] is working on apilot and creating set-top box applications.  (Scott Anenberg, Shaw,Pittman, 202/663-8000; Karen Petrou, ISD/Shaw, 202/296-5240; JulieWilliams, OCC, 202/874-5770; Thomas Vartanian, Fried, Frank, 202/639-7016.) Specifics of OCC Revision     The Office of the Comptroller (OCC) of the currency, last week, released revisions to Part 7 of its interpretive letters.  The finalrule:*   Modernizes bank data processing rules to recognize bankinvolvement in the area of electronic money.  A national bank mayperform, provide or deliver, through electronic means or facilities,any activity, function, product or service that it is now authorizedto perform, provide or deliver.  *   States that a national bank may market and sell excess capacity inelectronic activities to third-parties for uses not related tobanking.*   Clarifies that some lending activities must be completed at bank'smain office or branch.  A bank loan recipient must appear in-person atthe bank's main office or at a  branch to collect funds.  Loanorigination, approval and disbursal of loan proceeds by third partiesneed not be performed at a main office or branch.*   Defines interest to include fees for late payments, insufficientfunds, annual banking services and cash advances.  The fees can beapplied across state lines as with credit cards. *   Defines rules regarding banks' ability to lease excess space,share space and share employees with businesses other than otherfinancial institutions.  *   Provides national banks with added flexibility to structure theirprocedures governing board and shareholder actions by permitting thereliance on recognized complete bodies of corporate law and state lawswhere the bank's main office is located.*   Updates letter of credit provisions to reflect current industrypractices and to cover a broader category of transactions that are thefunctional equivalent of letters of credit. Back to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL DELIVERY SYSTEMS NEWS via NewsNetFebruary 16, 1996GROCERY STORES PROVING POPULAR BANKING VENUE    Branch location will continue to play a central role in thecustomer relationship, even as on-line banking and smart card deliverychannels become more popular, banking analysts predict (RDSN, Jan. 19,p. 3.).  But the size, location and services offered at branches willchange, analysts say.    In-store branches and mini-branches for grocery chains are twoalternative strategies to brick and mortar branches emerging in theindustry.  Last year, the number of in-store branch locationsincreased 25 percent and now stands at more than 3,000, according toInternational Banking Technologies (IBT) of Norcross, Ga., an in-storebranch consulting company.  These branches average 400 to 800 squarefeet and are staffed with several bank employees.    Mini-branches are the newest solution emerging as a tool to reachbusy consumers, said IBT's President John Garnett.  Mini-branchesrange in size from 35 square feet to 100 square feet and are automatedwith self-service loan and teller machines and video conferencingmodules.  The mini-branch is staffed by one or two employees, he said.     Mini-branches have greater space devoted to automated and self-service delivery, freeing specialized staff to make one-on-onecontacts in the supermarket aisles, Garnett said.  "We think this willfill the gap in stores that are too-tight for a full branch," headded.      IBT is finalizing its mini-branch prototype, which has yet to betested at a store, Garnett said.Success Story     One bank that has contributed significantly to the increasingnumber of in-store branches is First State Bank of Austin, Texas.      The $415 million-asset institution operates a total of 16 in-store branches at Wal Mart Supercenters and Kmarts, covering a morethan 1,200 miles between Midland, Texas and Corpus Christi, Texas. Five additions are planned this year, said Joseph Long, First Statechairman.     The bank, which trained employees to roam Wal Mart aisles anddiscuss loans with customers, has experienced loan volumes double thatof what was expected.  Deposit volumes also are higher than predictedat the in-store branches, he said.    "It's the repeat business in the grocery market, I think, thatmakes [in-store branches] work as well as they do," Long said. Studies indicate that the average American visits the grocery storetwo to three times a week.  Those numbers do not include theadditional reasons why consumers might visit Wal Mart SuperCenters,which often house opticians and unisex hair salons.  A supercenterconducts 30,000 to 60,000 transactions daily, Long said.    First State has been able to increase its market coverage at afraction of the cost, Long added.  Stand-alone brick and mortar bankscost $1 million or more to build compared to the $260,000 price tagfor an in-store mini-branch, he said.    In-store branches can be created for as little as $175,000. Mini-branches will fall under that figure because rent and staffingrequirements are even less, Garnett said.    In-store banking provides many benefits for banks, Garnett said:*   High-touch delivery channels.  The channel  fosters sales,allowing automation to handle routine transactions similar to IBT'smini-branch model.*   Merger and Acquisition Tool.  In-store branching makes it feasiblefor acquiring banks to maintain a presence in key markets whentraditional locations are closed to maximize efficiency.*   Opportunities to build market share.  Banks can move into newmarket areas without as much capital investment as with traditionalbranch expansion.  For example, all but one of the Wal Mart branchesopened by First State Bank is in a new market area for the bank, Longsaid.  Additionally, the inexpensive branch is a tool for communitybanks to ward off competition from larger banks.*   Increased customer service.  The in-store branch is open longerand located where consumers must go anyway.  It allows bankers tomaintain face-to-face contact even in the evening hours.  The branchesalso can provide services similar to brokerage firms.Consumer Attitudes Positive    National Commerce Bank Services Inc. (NCBS) of Memphis, Tenn., anin-store branching consultancy, recently predicted that the number ofin-store branches will reach 7,500 by the year 2000.  NCBS recentlyinterviewed about 800 shoppers in 20 states who said in-store bankingis important to them and that the branch should offer more than justdeposit and withdrawal services.  The study revealed that of thoseinterviewed:*   93 percent consider in-store bank very important;*   70 percent shop more frequently at the supermarket because ofbranch access;*   79 percent would use the in-store bank at least once a week andmore than 80 percent would visit the store just for bankingactivities; and*   About 40 percent said the in-store branch should add home equityloans, personal loans, safe deposit boxes and money market/mutual fundservices.    Two U.S. consulting companies specialize in advising banks oncreating in-store branches.  Pricing for the services vary accordingto the number of in-store branches needed, the mixture of bank-provided and vendor-provided materials and whether the firm has arelationship with the grocery store, Garnett said.    IBT is a business unit of First Data Corporation of Hackensack,N.J., offering a solution called Sales Platform, which has beenadopted by more than 250 U.S. banks and 950 in-store grocery branches,Wal Marts and Kmarts.  Customers include The State Bank and Union Bankin Central Valley, California.  NCBS is the consulting division ofNational Commerce Bancorporation, which has placed 62 of its 77branches inside supermarkets.  NCBS has advised more than 200 banks indeveloping 600 in-store branches.  Customers include newly signed onSunTrust Banks of Atlanta.

Back to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL DELIVERY SYSTEMS NEWS via NewsNetFebruary 16, 1996VISA CASH BENEFITS STILL UNPROVEN     The Visa Cash division of Visa International is betting that itcan divert some of the nation's $1.8 trillion in annual cashtransactions under $10 into Visa Cash exchanges. Visa believes thesetransactions are under the limit for which most people will use acredit card.     The banking industry has been awash with big ideas about smartcards that will hold all of a consumer's vital information, frommedical records to cash transactions.But Visa Cash stored-value card is designed to be simple and to helpconsumers get over technology hurdles, said Mary Buckley, Visa's vicepresident of stored value products.  Visa proposes to operate VisaCash on its existing VisaNet system and charge a fee for processingtransactions.      For banks, the card is a vehicle to put its name in consumerhands, an additional customer service and a fee generator, Buckleysaid.     But the service will require substantial upgrades inautomated teller machines' (ATMs) hardware and software and changes inmerchant point-of-sale equipment, said Basil Bromberg, president ofSmart Cards USA consultancy in Dallas.  "Change-over of equipment outin the field to support this card is going to be a multimillion dollareffort."    Additionally, the VisaNet system limits Visa Cash consumers tothe same merchants where they could use a credit card, Bromberg said. He criticized Visa for failing to offer enough information to helpbanks to make decisions about implementing the Visa Cash system.    Indeed, when asked about pricing and profitability potential,Buckley directed inquiries to each individual bank partner.  But sheacknowledged that, like the credit industry, smart cards may bringmore profits to the issuing banks that earn interest on funds throughfloat or unused cards funds.  Acquiring banks, on the other hand, canearn merchant transaction fees.    Visa Cash is in the pilot stages.  The 1996 Summer Olympicspilot, for example, will provide many answers to industry questionsabout smart card consumer acceptance, profitability and feasibility. "There's a lot of work to be done to validate the benefits.  When thetents are down and the athletes have gone home, we'll still be inAtlanta,"  Buckley said.

Debit and credit payments over the Internet received a boostrecently when card-association giants MasterCard and Visa scrappedtheir competing Internet security protocols and backed a uniformsecurity standard.  The companies believe the new protocol will makethe Internet safe for commerce, but consumer adaptation may be furtherbehind.  "I don't think their announcement is going to do very muchfor the progress or the pace at which the mass market adopts theInternet as a viable channel for commercial or retail enterprise,"says Mark Hardie, an analyst with The Tower Group, in Wellesley, Mass. "It's a complicated issue and there's more to it than simplyMasterCard and Visa agreeing that they'll use the same standard."  Thelarger issue is whether consumers will flock to the Internet as theyflock to suburban malls, he said.  The standard, called SecureElectronic Transaction (SET), combines features from MasterCard'sSecure Electronic Payment Protocol and Visa's Secure TransactionTechnology.  The protocol underlying SET is software-based public keycryptography from Redwood City, Calif.-based RSA Data Security.  It isthe same technology that MasterCard and Visa were using separately,which software vendors say they're able to support simultaneously. The question remains whether software-based public key encryption isan adequate form of security.  "It's better than nothing," says BobGargus, president of Atalla Corp., the San Jose, Calif.-based divisionof Tandem Computer Corp..  Atalla manufacturers hardware-basedencryption devices for automated teller machines and is offering peripherals for client-server systems to secure Internet-basedcommerce (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 6).

Back to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL DELIVERY SYSTEMS NEWS via NewsNetFebruary 16, 1996MICROSOFT TRANSACTS WITH VISA    As RDSN went to press, Microsoft and Visa Interactive revealedthey are working together to offer banks a turnkey remote bankingsolution.  Under the agreement, Visa Interactive will act as aprocessor for Microsoft's personal finance software, Money.  The morethan 30 banks offering Money have been processing payments through Intuit Services Corp. (ISC), also the processor for Intuit's [INTU]personal finance software, Quicken.     The processing arrangement, expected to be approved by VisaInternational next month, apparently offers a choice of processors forbanks that provide personal finance software from either Microsoft orIntuit, said Mark Hardie, technology analyst with the Tower Group inWellesley, Mass., who received a pre-announcement briefing fromMicrosoft and Visa.    Being forced to process transactions through ISC, rather than thebank's usual processor or a new one chosen by the bank, has been acommon complaint among banks offering the Intuit and Microsoftprograms.  The ISC contract is often the second or third processingarrangement banks must enter into to offer personal finance software.Microsoft Strategy    The Visa partnership may help Microsoft improve its relationshipwith the banking industry, which fears the software giant will becomea major competitor.    When Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates spoke to about 6,000 bankersat the Bank Administration Institute 's Retail Delivery '95 inDecember, he promised bankers future processing choices for homebanking.  Microsoft likely will keep its ISC relationship for banksthat want to use that processor, Hardie said.  "I don't thinkMicrosoft would be as successful going to banks directly and tellingthe banks to set up their own payment systems," he added.    Additionally, the Visa choice may provide a new comfort level forbankers who fear Microsoft, but are familiar with the Visa, Hardiesaid.    Microsoft's challenge is to keep Money competitive among Internetbanking and payment strategies, Hardie said.  Several competitors,including ISC, are creating products for Internet banking.    It's too early to say how the partnership will affect ISC, whichhas been the exclusive Money and Quicken processor by default, ISC'sChairman Bruce Burchfield told RDSN.  ISC will not disclose itstransaction volume numbers until Intuit's quarterly report ispublished next month.    It is unlikely that the larger banks, already processing withISC, will change to Visa because they would have to create a newinterface to replace one that already exists, Burchfield said.    Indeed, the Microsoft/Visa turnkey system will likely be mostattractive to smaller banks that do not have the resources to investin development, Hardie said.

REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FINES TOTALING $258,000LEVIED BY NASD AGAINSTWORTHEN RESPONDENTS     The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)announced Nov. 7 that it has assessed fines totaling $258,000against Worthen Investments, Inc. of Little Rock and several ofits officers and registered representatives in connection withthe sale on bank premises of mutual funds containing risky,derivative instruments.  Worthen Investments, Inc. and RelatedCases, Complaint No. C05950057 (NASD Dist. 5, New Orleans).     Investors who bought the funds have filed suit againstWorthen and its new holding company, Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.The investors allege the mutual funds were falsely touted assafe, government-guaranteed investments.  Many of the mutual fundsales allegedly took place inside branches of Arkansas' Worthenbanks, which were acquired by Boatmen's earlier this year alongwith Worthen Investments.     NASD is the self-regulatory organization for The NASDAQStock Market and the over-the-counter securities markets.     NASD said that Worthen and all of the individualrespondents, without admitting or denying the allegations againstthem, consented to the NASD disciplinary action taken by theAssociation's New Orleans District Business Conduct Committee.     The respondents, NASD said, consented to findings that theymade, or caused to have been made, misleading statements to theircustomers about the characteristics and safety features of themutual fund investments at issue.  NASD said that in addition toconducting many of the mutual fund sales on bank premises,Worthen "failed and neglected to perform adequate due diligencein connection with the promotion and sale of certain mutual fundproducts."  NASD said that Worthen also failed to keep copies ofall customer correspondence and failed to establish and maintainan adequate supervisory system.     Worthen itself was censured and fined $200,000.  Inaddition, NASD said, Worthen agreed to a number of additionalsanctions, including a promise to conduct a complete audit of allinternal policies and an agreement to form an investmentcommittee to meet regularly to review the methods used by Worthenpersonnel to market all securities.  The committee is toespecially consider the suitability of sales literature topromote the sale of the securities, NASD said.  The results ofthe independent audit and investment committee reviews aresubject to NASD inspection.     Among the individuals sanctioned were Patrick D. Miller,Worthen's former president, and Frank M. McGibbony, Worthen'sexecutive vice president and former compliance officer.     NASD said Miller agreed to a $10,000 fine, a five-yearsuspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify in allcapacities.  NASD said Miller consented to findings that he boreresponsibility for misleading and inaccurate statements to publiccustomers.  Through written solicitations approved by Miller,NASD said, at least seven registered Worthen representatives sentmisleading sales correspondence to public customers thatmisstated the characteristics and safety features of mutual fundinvestments.  Miller also failed to supervise employees who usesuch correspondence, NASD said.     NASD said McGibbony agreed to a $5,000 fine, a 30-daysuspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify as aprincipal.  According to NASD, McGibbony consented to findingsthat he approved certain items of misleading sales correspondencethat misstated the safety features of the mutual funds.  Inaddition, NASD said, McGibbony failed to ensure that copies ofcustomer correspondence were properly maintained in the firm'sfiles and failed to establish an adequate supervisory system.     Higher fines were levied against the seven representativeswho were sanctioned.  Jamai W. Weber was fined the highestamount, $70,300, suspended in all capacities for three months,and required to requalify in all capacities.  Altogether, theseven representatives were fined $130,900.     Five individuals employed by Worthen Bank & Trust Co., whichwas the Worthen parent company, also were censured and fined.     NASD said that Boatmen's cooperated fully with theinvestigation "and promptly instituted new policies andprocedures at Worthen to assure compliance and to prevent futureviolations."  (Boatmen's changed the name of the Worthen banksbut did not change the name of the investment company afteracquiring the Worthen enterprises.)Back to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES & COMMODITIES LIT. REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CFTC DISMISSES NUMEROUS'FRIVOLOUS' MOTIONS INNFA DISCIPLINARY CASE     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a Dec. 1 ordertossed out 59 motions filed by J&J Development Corp. and affirmeda National Futures Association (NFA) decision that imposed a fineof $2,000 against J&J for failure to keep timely financialstatements.  J&J Development Corp. v. National FuturesAssociation, No. CRAA-95-2 (CFTC).     Calling J&J's numerous filings "egregious," the CFTC saidthey were prohibited under CFR Section 171.10(d).     The numerous motions began after J&J appealed an NFAdecision that sanctioned the company for not filing financialstatements seven times between June 1990 and August 1992.  TheCFTC said J&J began its blizzard of motions with a monster briefthat was four times longer than permitted under CFTC regulationsand contained 456 exhibits.     The CFTC noted that the brief was followed by the filing of59 motions between January 1995 and July 1995.  The motionsgenerally reiterated points made in the brief, the CFTC said.     "[R]ule 171.10(d) itself provides that 'frivolous orrepetitive motions dealing with the same subject matter shall notbe permitted,'" the CFTC said.  "We find that most of appellant'spleadings in fact are the very sort of filings that Rule171.10(d) is intended to prohibit.  Although we decline to imposesanctions pursuant to Rule 171.11, we admonish J&J for itsegregious abuse of the process."     The CFTC noted that J&J's motions fell into three generalcategories.  Most of them were made up of arguments alreadycontained in the brief.  A second category was composed ofprocedural arguments, and a third responded to NFA's oppositionbrief.     The NFA also filed procedural motions, which included amotion to strike J&J's brief and exhibits.  The motions weredismissed as moot following the CFTC's ruling in favor of theNFA.     "[O]ur review of the record and the parties' appellatesubmissions establishes that NFA's findings and conclusions aresupported by the weight of the evidence; we therefore adoptthem," the CFTC said.  "We further conclude that NFA committed noerror material to the outcome of this proceeding, and the partieshave not raised any issues that merit extended discussion.Accordingly, we affirm NFA's decision without opinion."Back to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES & COMMODITIES LIT. REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SIXTH CIRCUIT: INVESTORS'CLAIMS AGAINST BROKERARE TIME-BARRED     Disgruntled investors in high-risk limited partnershipscannot arbitrate their claims against a brokerage firm becausethe six-year statute of limitations has passed, a divided panelof the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 27.  DeanWitter Reynolds Inc. v. M.C. McCoy et al., No. 94-5779(6th Cir.).     In a 2-1 decision, the majority said the limitations periodbegan to run when the investments were made and when theinvestors received prospectuses that clearly outlined thesubstantial risks, not when the investments later soured.     The dissenting judge found a material factual issue fortrial on the investors' argument that the limitations period wasequitably tolled because the brokerage firm fraudulentlyconcealed the unsuitable nature of the investments.  Thedissenter also said the National Association of Security Dealers(NASD) Code of Arbitration Procedure does not bar equitabletolling of the Section 15 limitations period.     The investors, described as unsophisticated retirees, statedthat their primary goals were preservation of principal and asteady income stream.  They were allegedly told by Dean WitterReynolds that limited partnerships would meet those goals andwere promised 20% returns and safety.  The NASD Code ofArbitration Procedure with its six-year time period wasincorporated by reference and stipulation into their agreements.     Dean Witter subsequently filed a declaratory judgmentcomplaint in the Eastern District of Tennessee, alleging thatclaims for improper investments were time-barred.  The investorswere permanently enjoined from litigation and arbitration.     The Sixth Circuit affirmed in a majority opinion by JudgeAlice M. Batchelder.  The arbitration claims were filed more thansix years after the investments were made and the clock beganticking, the court said, not when they later allegedly discoveredthe unsuitability of the investments.  Adopting the investors'reasoning would undermine Section 15's intent of setting asix-year limit on the arbitrability of claims, it said.     The majority also found the prospectuses to be clearlyworded and not misleading, even to novice investors.     It found no need to decide whether Section 15 is subject toequitable tolling, saying the investors failed to offersufficient evidence of fraudulent concealment.     In a dissent, Judge Karen Nelson Moore found a materialfactual issue as to whether Dean Witter had engaged in fraudulentconcealment.  She also said the equitable tolling doctrineapplies to claims filed more than six years after an investmentin unsuitable securities.     The due diligence requirement may be relaxed when aconfidential or fiduciary relationship exists, she said, and theprospectuses in this case are neither clear nor comprehensive.She also noted that a Dean Witter agent took the initiative tomeet with the investors, reassured them their goals would be metand made other statements that were gross exaggerations orclearly capricious.     In addition, Section 15 does not bar an equitable tollingclaim in Judge Moore's view because there was no evidence theseinvestors agreed to waive their right to use the equitabletolling doctrine.Back to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES & COMMODITIES LIT. REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SEC SUIT REMAINS INTACTDESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT'SECURITIES' DEFINITION     Noting that a question may ultimately exist as to whetherthe instruments used in multimillion-dollar transactions by theFoundation for New Era Philanthropy are securities under federallaw, Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Anita B. Brody onNov. 16 denied former New Era president John G. Bennett's motionto dismiss on that point and issued a discovery schedule.  SEC v.Bennett et al., No. 95-3005 (ED PA); see Securities & InsiderTrading LR, Aug. 21, 1995.     The motion by Bennett for a more definitive statement of SECcharges that he and New Era sold more than $100 million inunregistered securities in 1993 alone was denied by Judge Brodybecause Bennett "has not made clear the substance of hisobjections."     Bennett argued that the crux of the SEC's complaint iswhether the New Era notes are securities within the meaning ofthe federal securities laws.  Under every criteria, Bennettcontends, the notes fail to qualify as securities, i.e., asnotes, investment contracts and other evidence of indebtedness.     Judge Brody stated she was unable to say at this pointwhether the legal test for registered securities has been met.After discovery has been completed, the judge ruled, Bennett mayagain raise the issue and the parties at that time will addressthe economic realities of the transaction.     Regarding the motion for a more definitive statement fromthe SEC, the judge stated that the defects to which Bennettalludes are not obvious and that plaintiff did not have torespond to allusions to theories of potential liability in thecomplaint, only to factual allegations.  Because Bennett did notcomply with Rule 12(e), which requires him to point out thedefects complained of and the details desired, he has not madeclear the substance of his objections, Judge Brody stated.

REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SUP. CT. HEARS FINALITY OFPACT v. DE REPRESENTATIONADEQUACY ARGUMENTS     In arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court Nov. 27,Matsushita Electric Industrial Ltd. argued that if the NinthCircuit U.S. Court of Appeals' invalidation of a Delaware statecourt settlement of shareholder claims against it is notoverturned, corporations will have no assurance of the finalityof state court settlements that include federal securities lawcharges.  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. et al. v.Epstein et al., No. 94-1809 (U.S.).     Shareholder attorneys countered that Section 27 of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, which gives federal courtsexclusive jurisdiction to enforce any liability, prevented such asettlement -- especially where the securities law claims were notlitigated and were based on different wrongs than those at theheart of the state law breach of duty allegations.     In 1990, Matsushita acquired MCA Inc. for $6.1 billion.  Theacquisition was accomplished through a tender offer of $71 pershare of MCA common stock.     Rather than tender his shares, Lew Wasserman, MCA's chairmanand CEO at the time, entered into a separate agreement withMatsushita, known as the "Capital Contribution and LoanAgreement," pursuant to which Wasserman exchanged his shares forpreferred stock in a wholly owned Matsushita subsidiary calledMEA Holdings.  Sidney Sheinberg, MCA's COO at the time, tenderedhis shares pursuant to Matsushita's $71 per share offer.  Twodays after Sheinberg tendered his shares, he received anadditional $21 million in cash, ostensibly in exchange forunexercised MCA stock options.     Subsequently, former MCA shareholders who tendered theirshares for the $71 tender price filed suit in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Central District of California, alleging thatMatsushita violated SEC Rule 14d-10 by treating Wasserman andSheinberg differently from other shareholders in the tenderoffer.     The district court granted Matsushita summary judgment onclass action plaintiff representative Lawrence Epstein's claimthat Matsushita's agreement to pay Wasserman consideration thatwas different from the $71 per share tender offer violatedRule 14d-10.  The trial court subsequently granted Matsushita'smotion for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs' claims.Appeals were filed.     During the pendency of the consolidated appeals, theDelaware Chancery Court entered a judgment approving thesettlement of a state court class action that released all claimsarising out of Matsushita's tender offer for MCA stock --including the securities law charges.     The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's orderdenying plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment againstMatsushita on the Wasserman claim.  The panel also vacated thedistrict's court's order granting Matsushita's motion for summaryjudgment on the Sheinberg payment.     In addition, the appeals court held that the Delawarejudgment does not preclude the Epstein class action.  Finally,the panel vacated the district court's orders denying the Epsteinplaintiffs' motions for class certification and for leave toamend their complaint.     In its petition for writ of certiorari, Matsushita assertedthat the circuit court created an anomalous exception to the FullFaith and Credit Act that will frustrate the settlement of classaction litigation.  It also argued that implying a private rightof action under Rule 14d-10 violates principles announced by theSupreme Court and conflicts with decisions of the District ofColumbia, Third and Sixth Circuits.  Furthermore, Matsushitacontended that the circuit court expanded Rule 14d-10 in conflictwith the law in the Fourth Circuit and the tender offerregulatory scheme created by Congress.     Walter Minton, one of the plaintiffs, filed a separate briefin opposition, arguing that this is an appeal from aninterlocutory decision, not a final judgment, and the issuespresented arise because of the unique facts of the case.  Mintonalso stated that there is no need for the Supreme Court to decidewhether there is a private right of action under Rule 14d-10.     In a Feb. 13, 1993 opinion that followed a fairness hearingon the proposed settlement by objectors, then Vice ChancellorMaurice Hartnett noted that a "whiff of collusion" was not enoughto bar approval, especially since the pact -- in a revised form -- had an opt-out provision.     The justices asked plaintiff attorneys why the Californiaobjectors had not opted out of the settlement instead ofattacking it collaterally.  Plaintiff's attorneys argued that theDelaware Chancery Court made no inquiry into the adequacy ofrepresentation, thereby inviting a challenge to the settlement.     Nevertheless, some justices questioned the assertion thatonly a federal court could release federal securities claims.     Counsel for Matsushita are Barry R. Ostranger, Mary KayVyskocil, Paul C. Curnin and Joseph M. McLaughlin of Simpson,Thatcher & Bartlett in New York City.  Of counsel is GeoffreyHazard Jr., Trustee Professor of Law, University of Pennsylvania.

REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CFTC FINDS DEFENDANT'SBID TO VACATE DECISIONDID NOT FIT RULE 60(b)     Although Steven C. Brenner claimed that sanctions leveledagainst him by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should belifted because he satisfied a judgment, the CFTC ruled Nov. 11that Brenner's motion to set aside a final decision had beenfiled too late for him to obtain relief under FRCP 60(b).  In theMatter of Steven C. Brenner, No. 90-7 (CFTC).     "To obtain such relief, generally a party must firstdemonstrate that he acted within a reasonable time and show ameritorious defense," the CFTC said, noting that Brenner's motioninvolved a decision rendered four years ago.  The CFTC pointedout that a Rule 60(b) motion must be made "not more than one yearafter the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken."     In 1986, the CFTC ordered Brenner to pay a judgment of$5,987.20 to a complainant.  There was no record of Brenner'smaking the payment by early 1987, and he was automaticallyprohibited from trading on any contract market.  The CFTCEnforcement Division, however, learned in 1990 that Brenner hadviolated the trading prohibition in 1987 and 1988.     The Enforcement Division moved for a summary disposition.Brenner did not respond to the charges nor did he appear at aconsequent hearing before an administrative law judge.  The ALJfound Brenner liable on the charges and imposed a 10-year tradingban and a $10,000 civil monetary penalty.  Brenner did not seek amodification, and the summary disposition became a final order.Brenner did not appeal the order to the CFTC, and the case wasclosed.     In June 1992, the CFTC was informed that Brenner was tradingunder a fictitious name.  The Enforcement Division sought and wasgranted an injunction prohibiting Brenner from trading futures bythe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.     Brenner responded in February by asking the CFTC to setaside the sanctions on grounds he had paid the $5,987.20 judgmentin 1987.  He argued that his attorney had been incompetent fornot bringing the satisfaction of the judgment to the proper CFTCauthorities.  The complainant alleged that he was not paid until1994.               The Enforcement Division argued that Brenner's motion shouldbe denied because he had failed to demonstrate the "exceptionalcircumstances" necessary for the granting of relief underRule 60(b).   The CFTC, however, found that Brenner did not reachRule 60(b) because he brought his action well after the one-yearlimitation period.     "[W]e initially note that the sanctions Brenner seeks tohave vacated were imposed four and half years prior to theinstant motion.  Nevertheless, Brenner offers no explanation forthe delay in presenting the evidence he now asks us to consider.Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that his motion hasbeen filed within a reasonable time."     The CFTC noted that even if the action had been broughtwithin the period of limitation, relief under Rule 60(b) cannotbe granted based on the incompetence of a defendant's attorney.Quoting Nelson v. City College of Chicago, 962 F.2d at 755(7th Cir.), the CFTC said the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court ofAppeals has "never held that an attorney's gross negligencejustifies relief under Rule 60(b)."Back to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES & COMMODITIES LIT. REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996INVESTORS SAY RECEIVERLACKED AUTHORITY TO SELLSECURITIES-BACKED ASSETS     A group of California securities investors argued in aNov. 20 brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that theCentral District of California went beyond its jurisdiction inapproving a receiver's sale of real estate that the investorsclaimed they owned through the purchase of securities.  SEC v.American Capital Investments, Inc.; The ACI Investors Associationet al. v. Shaffer, Nos. 95-55193, 95-55283, 95-5587 and 95-55878(9th Cir.).     "The Receiver cannot sell the Investors' interests in theproperties because they are not within the Court's jurisdiction,"the investors argued.  "Under binding recent Supreme Courtprecedent (O'Melveny & Myers v. F.D.I.C...), the Court must lookto State law to define its remedial jurisdiction in Receivershipcases.  Under California law -- as well as all otherjurisdictions -- a Receiver steps into the shoes of the defendantfor whom he is appointed and brings into custodia legis only thesame quality and quantity of title as was owned by thedefendant."     The case began in August 1993 when the Securities andExchange Commission filed a complaint alleging securities fraudagainst American Capital Investments, Inc. (ACI), which had beenselling securities interests in real estate investments.  By thetime the SEC obtained a restraining order, 156 investors hadpurchased securities backed by commercial real estate.               The investors -- later organized as the ACI InvestorsAssociation -- claimed they held title to the property directlythrough deeds and indirectly through partnerships with ACI.  Thejurisdictional issue presently before the Ninth Circuit had itsgenesis in the September 1993 federal court appointment ofRichard G. Shaffer as ACI's receiver.  Shaffer took over ACI'sreal estate assets and sold the properties to a Canadianinvestment firm.     According to the investors' opening brief, "The investorscontend that no one can sell what he does not own.  The Receiverseeks to sell 100 percent fee interests in eight ACIcommercial/office properties -- despite that fact that ACI didnot own 100 percent fee interests.  The investors own majorinterests in at least four of the eight properties...."     The investors claimed the Central District of California didnot have jurisdiction to approve the sale and appealed to theNinth Circuit.     Citing to O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct. 2048 (1994),which had relied in part on Allen v. Ramsay, 179 Cal.App.2d 843,4 Cal.Rptr. 575 (1960), the investors argued that federal courtsdo not have the power to displace state law in cases involvingthe authority of receivers.     "There is no principle of California law which would permita Receiver to sell a better state of title than he acquired when'he stepped into the shoes' of the Defendant," the investorsargued.  "Applying the law to this case, there is no power toconvey a better title to the ACI properties than ACI itself hadand the district court's sale order is therefore void."     The appellant investors are represented by Thomas W.Dressler and Patrick J. Evans of Dressler, Rein & Evans in LosAngeles.Back to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES & COMMODITIES LIT. REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996OFFICER ARGUES THAT NASDEXCEEDED AUTHORITY IN CASEINVOLVING NONMEMBER FIRM     An officer of an Oregon holding company, which owned asecurities dealer but did not sell securities, argued in aNov. 24 opening brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appealsthat the National Association of Securities Dealers stretchedbeyond its jurisdiction by sanctioning him for a snafu involvinga misdirected securities account deposit.  Alderman v. Securitiesand Exchange Commission, No. 95-70609 (9th Cir.).     "The use of NASD's power to sanction in this context exceedsthe power delegated to it by the Malone Act since it seeks toimpose sanctions over a person not engaged in the investmentbanking or securities business for his alleged failure to act inhis corporate capacity with a non-member private corporation,"according to the brief.     Daniel Joseph Alderman, an officer and director of Portland-based Peregrine Holdings Limited, focused his argument onallegations that the NASD had trammelled on state corporationslaw by imposing federal regulatory proceedings over a state-chartered, non-NASD member private business.     "The governance of internal corporate affairs [is] reservedunder the Constitution to state law," Alderman argued."Corporations such as Peregrine are creatures of state law andthe relationship created thereby are entrusted entirely to statelaw....  As a result, state laws govern the internal affairs ofprivate corporations and federal law shall not intrude into thoseinternal affairs."     According to the brief, this case stems from a check for$3,193.23 that was mistakenly deposited into a Peregrinecorporate account instead of into the account of a Peregrine-owned securities dealer, American Interstate Financial Corp.(AIFC).  Peregrine discovered the mistake and issued a check forthe full amount to the AIFC customer.     The NASD claimed that Alderman deliberately withheld paymentfor two whole months.  Alderman said the NASD allegation wasunsupported.     The deposit snafu eventually resulted in the filing of adisciplinary action against Alderman by the District BusinessConduct Committee (DBCC) of the NASD.  In addition to being anofficer and director, Alderman was Peregrine's executive vicepresident.  He was also a director of AIFC.  The DBCC foundAlderman to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of theNASD's Rules of Fair Practice.    Article III states:  "A member, in the conduct of hisbusiness, shall observe high standards of commercial honor andjust and equitable principles of trade."     According to the brief, the DBCC censured Alderman and finedhim $3,000.  Alderman sought review of the decision by the NASD'sNational Business Conduct Committee (NBCC), which affirmed theDBCC.     The $3,000 case found its way further up the appeals ladderwhen Alderman asked the Securities and Exchange Commission toreview the NBCC's finding.  The SEC affirmed.  Alderman appealedto the Ninth Circuit.      The brief, citing O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct.2048, 2053, 129 L.Ed.2d 76 (1994), argued that state law -- notthe NASD -- governs Alderman's actions as a Peregrine officer.Specifically, Alderman pointed out that ORS Chapter 60.371allowed Peregrine to delegate day-to-day operations of thecompany.  In this instance, responsibility for Peregrine's bankaccounts fell to a vice president for finance and not toAlderman, the brief argued.      "The standards to which directors are held are establishedby state law," Alderman argued.  "A director must be diligent andprudent in managing the corporation's affairs.  It is clearlyrecognized that the Board's responsibility is limited tooverseeing the operation."     Alderman is represented by Allan A. Fulsher of Portland, OR.The SEC is represented by Randall W.

First of all, the nature of the consumer market is changing,with a large portion of the population moving from being saversto investors, "in part driven by low rates, in part driven by thefact that baby boomers are inflation-conscious and investment-driven," said Ed Furash, a Washington, D.C., bank consultant.This group is searching for yield and isn't content with currentsavings account and certificate of deposit (CD) earnings.      Banks, in turn, are stuck with a big distribution system andthe need to increase fee income to offset their shrinking netinterest margins. "At the same time, banks don't have a lot ofloans to make--the demand and quality aren't there," he said.      Banks have to stop the drain on deposits caused by plunginginterest rates.  "In the battle between banks and non-banks, it'sessential banks enter non-bank products such as annuities andinsurance.  If not, non-bank competitors will steal banks blind,"Furash said.      An illustration of the strength fee income can generate isSt. Louis-based Mark Twain Bancshares, which recently reported a37.94 percent increase in 1992 earnings over 1991.  The bankattributes its strong performance in part to its revenues fromits fee-based divisions (bond, brokerage, mortgage and trust),which grew a collective 30.01 percent in 1992 compared to 1991.   You Can Jump in All at Once or Dip in a Toe at a Time      Some banks are taking bold steps in their commitment toinvestment products. A prime example is NationsBank Corp.'spartnership created this fall with Dean Witter Financial ServicesGroup Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co.  The twosubsidiaries each own 50 percent of the new firm, called NationsSecurities, a Dean Witter/NationsBank Co., headquartered inCharlotte, N.C.  The company is an independent securitiesbrokerage firm and has about 400 investment officers now workingat selected NationsBank banking centers around the country.      Another tactic is to set up a separate bank subsidiary, thenhire outside investment professionals.  First Chicago Corp.'sbankers call customers before a CD is about to mature.  Customersdisappointed by the new CD rates available are referred tononbanker investment professionals; mutual fund sales havetripled.      Other banks are cautious about the investment product wave'sfuture, or don't have the time or money for new productdevelopment.  But banks can still profit from rent and fee incomegenerated from investment firms sharing branch space.  Anotherstrategy is to take advantage of third-party processors that, tovarying degrees, help banks sell investment products.   Don't Expect a Magic Carpet Ride      Unfortunately, investment products aren't a guaranteed magiccarpet ride to profitability.  Successfully marketing investmentproducts requires a lot of planning, including developing amarketing plan that focuses on customers' needs; after all,investment product managers shouldn't try to sell a high-growthstock fund to a 90-year-old woman.      The mutual fund industry may now have more than $1.67trillion in assets, but so far bank proprietary funds have reliedmainly on converting existing assets rather than acquiring newcustomers, said Kenneth Hoffman, president of the Optima GroupInc., a Connecticut-based marketing consulting firm thatspecializes in helping banks market mutual funds.      The majority of bank proprietary mutual fund growth iscoming from the cannibalization of existing assets, he noted; tochange that trend, banks must put on their marketing hats.When asked what pitfalls to avoid, Furash fired off this list:Improperly explaining the product, including giving full andcomplete disclosure of the risks;  Offering funds that areattractive to the bank, not the customer; Trying to sell a stockor fund without understanding what the customer wants; Confusingthe customer by selling too many options.  Most people want threeor four different options, plus some advice on allocation; Notoffering the right mix of options; Failure to perform duediligence, investigating mutual fund vendors.Many more potential traps probably lie ahead, so go cautiously.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK SECURITIES NEWS via NewsNetMarch 12, 1993   Market Ripe for the Taking   Market Ripe for the Taking      Despite snares, industry analysts are predicting that bankinvestment products will be successful.  Baby boomers' propensityto invest will be coupled with the fact that banks can use theirexisting distribution system and their image to cash in on thisgrowing market.  Banks have a traditionally more trustworthyreputation than non-banking institutions, said Furash.   Bank of America Funds Show Strong Growth      Bank of America is an example of a bank reaping big rewards.Its Pacific Horizon Mutual Funds grew by 83 percent last year, asopposed to the entire mutual fund industry's growth of 23percent.  The nine funds had $12.2 billion in average assetsunder management in 1992, compared with $6.6 billion in 1991.      The growth of new assets in 1992 was principally due toinstitutional clients--banks trust departments and Fortune 500companies--that chose mutual funds over direct instruments, saidDebra McGinty-Poteet, senior vice president and manager of mutualfunds for Bank of America.      Other reasons are low interest rates that make funds moreattractive to investors and marketing and sales efforts byConcord Financial Group Inc. (the distributor) and therelationship managers at Bank of America Funds Management, saidMcGinty-Poteet.  Bank of America's and Security Pacific NationalBank's April 1992 merger also resulted in the convergence ofseveral funds.      Bank of America NT&SA is the investment adviser to thePacific Horizon Funds.  Concord Holding Corp., a proprietary bankmutual fund administrator, administers the Pacific Horizon funds;its subsidiary, Concord Financial Group Inc., is the sponsor andunderwriter and distributor.      Here are some tips from Hoffman on how to make mutual fundsand other investment products tempting enough to keep existingdeposits as well as attract new customers--and their money.      1.  Give investment products the marketing efforts they deserve.Banks aren't placing a priority on marketing funds, and "manybanks have attempted to pass marketing responsibility over totheir distributors without effectively communicating theirexpectations," said Hoffman.  According to a survey performed byOptima, 17 percent of senior fund managers reported that nodollars were committed to mutual fund marketing, while 28 percentdidn't know what percentage of operating expenses went to fundsmarketing.       Optima Group discovered in its survey that banks with amarketing plan are twice as likely to view their fund product as"very successful," yet more than one-half of the banks surveyed,with proprietary funds, had no developed marketing plan.      The best approach is to cultivate a joint marketing planwith the distributor, said Hoffman; that is done by about 36percent of the banks with a marketing plan.  Another 29 percentdid one in-house, while 36 percent left marketing to thedistributor.      Banks also err by not properly allocating advertisingdollars.  "The strategy that works well for Fidelity and Vanguardis unlikely to work for your bank for two fundamental reasons:First, customers of the mutual fund companies are unlikely toswitch; second, the mutual fund companies will always outspendyou," he said, adding that the large mutual fund companies canspend more than $100 in advertising and marketing for every newcustomer they acquire.      2.  Avoid turf wars.  Retail bankers are used to thinking oftrust departments as handling clients with tax, estate andinvestment management concerns.  In turn, trust departments viewbrokers as people poised to steal the best customers, and viewretail customers as unprofitable.      The choice is "to rely exclusively on converted assets andlet your departments squabble over control of the marketing ofthe mutual funds or to develop a consistent, well thought-outmarketing plan that commits a significant portion of bankresources to capitalize on the immense potential of mutualfunds," said Hoffman.      3.  Capitalize on Competitive Advantages.  One of thoseadvantages is customer access, including information fromdatabases, branches and loan applications.      "Frequent contact with customers provides a tremendousopportunity to cross-sell existing customers into mutual funds.This is an advantage which brokerage firms, insurance companiesand other financial competitors do not have.  At a bank,customers literally 'come to you,'" Hoffman said.      4.  Focus on customers with the greatest promise.  Carefullyanalyze available data, including DDA dollar velocity, CDbalances, credit card balances, credit lines and savingsbalances.  Doing so separates the investors from the savers.      DDA dollar velocity, the amount of money a customer putsinto his checking account each month, can be a prime indicator ofcustomer income.      Combined with other research such as car buying habits andresidence location, the resulting market segmentation can be usedfor mailings and telemarketing, Hoffman said.  Its effectivenessin using it to market investment products can then be tested andrefined.      "This data on purchase behavior is critical," said Hoffman."Banks should take pains to update it, nurture it and make it anoperable part of future marketing efforts.      5.  Divide and conquer, then offer something extra.  Dividepotential customers into three groups:  the traditional mutualfund retail customer, the affluent and the high-end trustcustomer.  Retail customers traditionally don't understand thedifference between stocks and bonds.  But they could become alucrative market if those products are explained properly.      The high-end investors need more services, such as trustservices and portfolio rebalancing.      Customers that fall in the middle may require a relationshipmanager; they often need more service than the traditional retailcustomer but don't possess the assets of a trust customer, saidHoffman.      6.  Offer brokers incentives.  Instead of worrying that thebrokers will take away the largest customers, bankers need tofocus on strengthening those relationships.  Besides offeringmonetary incentives, bankers can give brokers access to customerdata and sales support.  Separate customer statements for thefunds are attractive, as are prospectus wraps with strong salesmessages, dedicated wholesaler telephone support, service supportand cross-sale programs to encourage customers to commitadditional dollars to the fund.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK SECURITIES NEWS via NewsNetMarch 12, 1993BANKS AGAINST NON-BANKS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS      Despite the hard knocks banks have taken in the recent past,commercial bank trust departments have come out winners over thepast 10 years when it comes to equity investments.      In fact, over the past decade banks have outperformed mutualfunds, insurance companies and investment advisors in equityfunds under management, according to an annual study conducted byCDA Investment Technologies Inc., an independent investmentperformance measurement service.      The Rockville, Md.-based company also found that banksreaped higher equity returns than insurance companies and mutualfunds over the last three- and five-year periods.      Fixed income returns also fared well, with banks remainingcompetitive with those experienced by mutual fund and insurancecompanies over the last three-, five- and 10-year periods.   Bank Trust Departments Produce Returns as Good as Non-Banks      The survey results are evidence that bank trust departmentsare holding their own and producing good investment returns fortheir clients.      "Not only do the absolute returns compare favorably to ourmajor competitors, but bank-managed portfolios have exhibitedmore consistent results under varying market conditions, areflection of lower risk profiles," said Henry Gooss, managingdirector and chief investment officer of Chemical Bank.      For the one-, three-, and five-year periods, investmentadvisors achieved the highest annualized rate of return inequities, but banks edged them out over the last 10-year period.      The chart below summarizes the study's findings for the one-, three-, five- and 10-year period ended Dec. 31, 1992:ANNUALIZED RATE OF RETURN ON EQUITIES                      1-Yr      3-Yr      5-Yr    10-YrBanks                  8.7%    11.3%      15.7%   15.6%Mutual Funds           8.5%    10.0%      14.0%   13.5%Insurance Cos.         7.5%    10.3%      14.9%   15.4%Investment Advisors    9.3%    11.9%      16.3%   15.3%S&P's 500              7.6%      The survey also found that banks have performed consistentlyin the fixed-income area against mutual funds and insurancecompanies.  Investment advisors were excluded for lack of data.      For the one-year period, banks, at 6.8 percent, wereslightly behind mutual funds (6.9 percent) and insurancecompanies (7.1 percent).  Over the last three years, banksachieved a 9.8 percent annualized rate of return, ahead of mutualfunds (9.4 percent) and behind insurance companies (10.2percent).      Over the five-year period, banks, which achieved a 10-percent annualized rate of return, were again behind insurancecompanies (10.6 percent), but still ahead of mutual funds (9percent).  This pattern repeated itself over the 10-year period,with banks reaping 10.6 percent, mutual funds bringing in 10.2percent and insurance companies achieving 11.3 percent.      The Rockville, Md.-based research firm based its equityresearch on a survey of 1,489 managers, consisting of 217 bank-pooled funds, 73 separate/variable insurance accounts, 577 mutualfunds and 622 investment advisors, which manage a total of $1.2trillion in assets.      For its fixed-income research, CDA surveyed 741 managers,broken down into 215 bank-pooled funds, 38 separate and variableinsurance accounts and 488 mutual funds, that manage a total of$316 billion in assets.

The Financial Services Act (H.R. 458), introduced by Rep.Peter Hoagland (D-Neb.) in January, would expand bankers' abilityto engage in full mutual fund activities by permitting banksubsidiaries and affiliates to underwrite and distribute mutualfunds. Mutual funds represent a significant market for bankers.Approximately 120 banks now offer over 675 proprietary mutualfunds; total assets are an estimated $25 billion.  But undercurrent law, banks must use a middleman instead of having fullcontrol over sponsorship and distribution of their own products.      Banks are only permitted to serve as investments advisers,custodians, transfer agents and fund administrators.      National banks, their subsidiaries and bank holding companysubsidiaries are also allowed to both broker and recommendsecurities of investment companies for which they serve asinvestment advisors.   Act Would Give Bankers More Freedom      The act would give bankers the freedom to sponsor,distribute and underwrite mutual fund shares--eliminating theneed to involve a third-party provider. Also, managementinterlocks between a bank or bank holding company and the mutualfund subsidiary would be permissible.  The act would also requireone-time disclosures to be made to customers regarding, amongother things, the lack of FDIC insurance for these investmentproducts.      This bill has seen no action yet.  It was first introducedin the closing hours of the last session, mainly for purposes ofdiscussion.  Keep an eye out.   The Investment Adviser Regulatory Enhancement and Disclosure Act      This bill (H.R. 578), introduced by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) in January, would amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,an act criticized by industry players for having no teeth.      The bill proposes to rectify the deficiency by providingenhanced supervision and regulation of investment advisers byproviding for:       Higher registration fees (initial and yearly) forinvestment advisers to fund more SEC inspections and surveys ofunregistered advisers; More frequent SEC examination of high riskadvisers;  A record-keeping requirement to verify suitability;SEC authority to designate a self-regulatory organization toconduct investment adviser examinations; Enhanced disclosurethrough brochures containing general information, advancetransactional reports revealing commissions and third-partypayments, and periodic reports of all charges; Client assets;Disqualification from being an investment adviser for a felonyconviction; Confidentiality with respect to personallyidentifiable information unless consent is given.      Because the bill doesn't propose any change in thedefinition of investment adviser, it wouldn't apply to banks ortheir trust departments as they are currently exempt from thedefinition.  It would, however, have an impact on banks that haveestablished separate subsidiaries.      This act was also introduced last session and passedcommittees in both the House and Senate, but differences couldn'tbe worked out before the recess. Testimony has already begun thissession, and further action is expected.Back to Headline List WT03-B39-16IA060-000326-B015-174http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi27.html 205.156.212.5 19970115012839 text/html 38524HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:26:50 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:08 GMTContent-length: 38335Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi27.html Sample Issue Copyright SECURITIES WEEK via NewsNet January 8, 1996 Vol. 23., N SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEW CALIFORNIA ACTION SEEKS RESCISSION OF PRU PARTNERSHIP RESIDUALS (519 words) MEGA-PRODUCER LANYI LANDS AT OPCO'S MIDTOWN BRANCH (168 words) NYSE MEMBERS FINDING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LEASE SEATS AS PRICES SOAR (359 words) LAWYERS FIGHTING OVER ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS IN NASDAQ ANTITRUST SUIT (257 words) PRU'S FORMER SAN FRANCISCO MANAGER MOVES TO NASHVILLE (120 words) DEBATE REMAINS ON RULES TO ENSURE BEST EXECUTION FOR MULTIPLE TRADED OPTIONS (691 words) NASD SEEKS NEW BROKER/DEALER COMPENSATION LIMITS ON MUTUAL FUND AND VARIABLE CONTRACT SECURITIES (404 words) BROADCASTING ANALYST JOINS SCHRODER WERTHEIM (125 words) STRAUS TO JOIN JEFFERIES AS INSTITUTIONAL SALES MANAGER (77 words) GLAZER TO JOIN WHEAT FIRST IN A NEWLY CREATED POSITION (77 words) VOLPE, WELTY MAKES MANAGEMENT CHANGES FOLLOWING RECORD YEAR (136 words) JOSEPHTHAL'S SATLOFF JOINS PRIME CHARTER (87 words) S.W.I.F.T.

The group, which brought its case in California Superior Court inSacramento County, is also demanding rescission of both the residualpayments and its members' limited partnership investments because the firmfailed to disclose financial incentives for brokers to sell the funds.   Among former high-ranking Prudential Securities executives receivingresidual payments is James Darr, the former head of the firm's DirectInvestment Group, who has frequently been mentioned during investigationsof the firm's partnership problems. According to published reports, Darrhas received more than $2 million in partnership residuals.   ``We're saying that the fraud was not over and done with at the time ofthe sales,'' said Allan Haley, one of three lawyers representing the group.``Every day Prudential pays residuals is a continuation.''Prudential has responded to the claim and a hearing on that response isscheduled for Jan. 30.   The plaintiffs have petitioned the court to enjoin and restrainPrudential from ``making or receiving'' further residual payments withoutfirst making full disclosure of each contractual obligation currently ineffect and offering to rescind each contract for the sale of a Prudentialdirect investment made in California.   The suit also is seeking to rescind each limited partnership sale madeafter Sept. 1, 1982, and force Prudential ``to account for and to disgorgethe profits made through its unlawful and unfair business acts andpractices in California.'' The investors made their partnership purchasesbetween 1983 and 1987.   The foundation of the suit is in a California statute stating anyfinancial interests a broker has in a security must be disclosed prior tothe transaction. Unless the broker notifies the client of the existence ofthe financial interest, a client has a right to cancel the transaction.   ``Not disclosed in any offering document or sales communication directedto any plaintiff or other purchaser was the fact that the registeredrepresentative of PSI making such sale had been given by PSI anindeterminate, open-ended participation in the cash flow, earnings,refinancing and distribution rights held by the PSI affiliate involved inthat PSI partnership,'' according to the plaintiffs' filing.   The suit also includes a 1982 memo from former Prudential CEO GeorgeBall that states: ``Starting September 1st, 50% of Bache's net earningsfrom Tax Investment Group programs, from which Bache Properties, BacheEnergy, or Bache Leasing subsequently earns asset residuals interestsand/or cash flow, will be paid to Account Executives who sell $25,000 ofany such offering.''   Prudential's response said the plaintiffs' claims are made beyond thestatute of limitations, coming eight years after their initial investments,that the California laws under which the claim is filed is pre-empted byFederal statutes, and that the state's Business and Professional code isnot applicable to securities transactions based on a similar 1988 ruling inHawaii.   San Francisco law firm Steefel, Levitt & Weiss is representingPrudential in the case.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NMEGA-PRODUCER LANYI LANDS AT OPCO'S MIDTOWN BRANCHBy:Daniel Colarusso   Andrew Lanyi, author, radio show host, and $4 million-producer, lastweek agreed to bring his team to Oppenheimer & Co.'s Midtown Manhattanoffice from Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., branch manager Jordan Berlinconfirmed.   At Ladenburg, Lanyi operated his team as a self-contained unit, AndrewLanyi Research Inc., but he will join Oppenheimer as a senior vp. He willcontinue to publish his own research and follow what he terms ``tomorrow'sblue chips,'' undervalued, under-followed stocks.   Lanyi's 10-person team is comprised of three brokers, one full-timeanalyst, and other support staff. Berlin described Lanyi as the ``mostorganized, hardest-working broker I've ever known.''   In addition to his brokerage work, Lanyi, a Holocaust survivor whoarrived in the United States penniless, has a radio show on New York's WEVDand has written a book, ``Confessions of a Stockbroker.''   One national headhunter said Lanyi, who was at Lehman Brothers beforeLadenburg, was among the most sought-after brokers on the recruitingscene.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NNYSE MEMBERS FINDING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LEASE SEATS AS PRICES SOARBy:Heike Wipperfurth   While the NYSE is ringing out 1995 on many record notes, floor brokersand specialists are beginning to feel the heat as prices of membershipleases on the Big Board are reaching a new high, making it more difficultfor some to afford the cost as demand remains strong, sources said.   While some NYSE participants seem eager to pay higher prices formembership privileges on the world's largest equities market, others areunwilling or unable to pay up, and drop out, sources said.   Attorney James Rothenberg said that he had unfilled demand from aspecialist and a floor broker wanting to purchase a lease on a seat at anannual cost of $150,000 each, up from recent lease prices of between$130,000 and $140,000. Prices are typically negotiated between the lesseeand the lessor as a private agreement and the NYSE does not get involved,an NYSE spokeswoman said.   Demand for seat leasing is skyrocketing because of the recent rise intrading volume and the positive direction of the market, Rothenberg said.   Sources said that about 740, or more than half of the 1,366 seats on theBig Board, have been leased. The rise in demand for the limited amount ofseats creates major problems for some members, sources said.   ``It's definitely a problem. It's hard to get a lease,'' a source said.A lot of specialists, he noted, are trying to lock in costs by payingpremium prices for two-year leases. They are afraid that next year's pricesmay be even higher, he said. As a result, some two-dollar brokers are notable to make it and they drop out, he noted.   The high prices for seat leases reflect record prices for seat sales,sources noted. One source predicted that a seat soon could go for as muchas $1.15 million up from the last seat sale at $1,05 million in December.   At the end of 1995, the Big Board's market capitalization reached $6trillion. There were 2,675 NYSE-listed companies with 155.2 billion sharesavailable on the exchange, according to statistics from the Federation ofInternational Stock Exchanges.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NLAWYERS FIGHTING OVER ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS IN NASDAQ ANTITRUST SUITBy:Heike Wipperfurth   Lawyers on both sides of the antitrust suit involving 33 of the biggestNasdaq market makers filed court motions in December accusing the otherside of not providing enough documents, sources said.   The bickering between the opposing sides will be carried into the courtroom for a hearing on January 17 before Judge Robert Sweet in the U.S.District Court for the Southern District of New York, an attorney said.   Defendants' lawyers filed a motion in late December requesting moredocuments relating to how `class' was defined by the plaintiff lawyers, hesaid. Plaintiffs' lawyers, on the other hand, are fighting for additionalaccess to documents and tape recordings and are asking for permission toconfer with the Justice Department, he noted.   Both sides think that they do not have everything they are entitled to,he said. This is ``the typical bickering over how much paper each side isgoing to produce at the beginning of a big case,'' he added.   In addition, the source said that Judge Sweet has to make a decision ona motion filed by the Los Angeles Times in December, requesting, amongother things, that the court break its confidentiality order and provideaccess to the tapes and other material handed over to the plaintiff lawyersby the defendants.   The antitrust suit accusing major Nasdaq market makers of collusion,price fixing and overpricing was filed after an academic study brought topublic attention of indirect evidence of implicit collusion among marketmakers.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NPRU'S FORMER SAN FRANCISCO MANAGER MOVES TO NASHVILLEBy:Daniel Colarusso   Mike Baker, Prudential Securities' former San Francisco branch manager,last week moved to Nashville to take over the firm's branch in the city,sources said.   Baker was dismissed from his San Francisco manager's post in late 1994for what appeared to be compliance-related problems (SW, 7 Nov. '94, 4). Atthat time, Baker had been expected to take the helm of the consolidatedoffice made up of Prudential's two metro San Francisco offices. That branchis the firm's largest nationwide.   Since leaving the managerial position, Baker has continued working forPrudential as an internal auditor.   Ironically, Nashville manager Rick Hertz was recently dismissed forcompliance-related problems in that same office.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NDEBATE REMAINS ON RULES TO ENSURE BEST EXECUTION FOR MULTIPLE TRADEDOPTIONS   A letter submitted recently to the SEC by the Committee On OptionsProposals concerning the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's so-called ``Trade orSend'' rule for multiple traded options, indicates that a split remainswithin the industry on how to ensure the best execution of trades entered.   The letter, while noting that the COOP ``has [previously] endorsed[Phlx's] filing in principal,'' also indicated that it ``has receivedlittle or no support from the other exchanges.''Under Phlx's proposed rule, which was submitted as the exchange's proposalto ensure that customers receive the best offered price on an option at alltimes, when a market maker or specialist at another exchange makes a betterbid than his counterpart at another exchange where the order was firstsubmitted, the order would automatically be sent to the exchange making abetter market.   Part of the Phlx rule also requires that public customer orders bedesignated as ``Principal Acting as Agent,'' or PA orders, to differentiatethem from trades submitted by institutional customers. However, sourcessaid, that rule provision has led to some market makers and specialistsrefusing to honor posted prices for anything other than small customerorders.   Previously, a majority of the industry had instead supported, and stillsupport, a so-called ``Trade or Fade'' rule, which allows market makers andspecialists to match a better bid, or to contact his counterpart at theother exchange to negotiate the price. Then, if the market maker orspecialist making the better bid decides not to deal with his counterparthe can withdraw (fade) the bid.   While the Trade or Fade rule has been used up until now, the COOP notedin its letter to the SEC that several exchanges have indicated that ``theirmarket-makers/specialists match the Best Bid/Offer (BBO) [only] 93% of thetime they receive options orders that are eligible for automatedexecution.''Although the COOP called the results ``a commendable feat,'' it alsoindicated that ``the member firm community is very concerned about theportion of the remaining 7% who do not obtain the BBO.''   The Trade or Fade rule, the COOP added, is by it nature limited inaddressing the problem, and it added that in any case ``it has beenreported that some trading crowds are not honoring Trade or Fadeprocedures.''Phlx's rule would seem to solve the problem, but the COOP noted in itsletter that the nation's other four options exchange don't support it.   In the past, the other exchanges have argued that to properly implementa Trade or Send rule a fully automated linkage system would need to bedeveloped, something that was originally part of an overall plan for themultiple trading environment but that was abandoned as too costly beforemultiple listing was imposed on the entire market for new listings.   As a compromise, Phlx's rule was supported in principal with theprovision that the exchange make various adjustments, but sources indicatedthat many COOP members now regret the endorsement.   For its part, the SEC has not been pressuring the exchanges extensivelyto accept a standardized rule, probably because the BBO has occurred in thevast majority of cases. With competition for new listings heating up,though, the agency could begin to push the industry more strongly.   Previously the regulator delayed a vote on any rule regarding the issueuntil December of last year, allowing a November deadline to pass. Thecurrent government shutdown followed, so the agency has yet to act and it'sunclear when it will be able to do so.   In the meantime, the COOP has scheduled a meeting for this Saturday forindustry representatives to discuss the issue, along with some otherissues. Among the topics to be discussed will be whether to reconsider thedevelopment of a linkage system to determine if it would be ``economicallyfeasible.''   Separately, The Options Industry Council, an educational andinformational group comprised of the nation's options exchanges and TheOptions Clearing Corp., last week reported that equity options volumereached an all-time high in 1995, with 174.4 million contracts changinghands, surpassing the previous record, set in 1987, by 6%.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NNASD SEEKS NEW BROKER/DEALER COMPENSATION LIMITS ON MUTUAL FUND ANDVARIABLE CONTRACT SECURITIES   The NASD is seeking SEC approval to amend its Rules of Fair Practice tolimit the use of ``cash and non-cash compensation received bybroker/dealers who sell mutual funds and variable contract securities.''   The NASD said the amendments would ``tighten and broaden existing ruleson the sale of these investment products,'' and added that they wereproposed ``in response to the increased use of non-cash compensation andcertain types of incentive-based cash compensation for the sale ofinvestment company and variable contract securities.''   Such practices, the NASD said, ``may heighten the potential for amember's loss of supervisory control over sales practices and increase thepossibility of the perception of impropriety,'' resulting in a loss ofinvestor confidence.   Broadly, the new rule amendments would do the following:   -- Prohibit, except under certain circumstances, broker/dealers fromreceiving any cash or non-cash compensation from anyone other than the NASDmember with which the individual is associated.   -- Require that NASD members maintain records of compensation receivedfrom an investment company, an adviser to an investment company, a fundadministrator, an underwriter and any affiliated person.   -- Prohibit receipt by a broker of cash compensation in connection withthe sale of investment company securities, unless the arrangement isdescribed in the current prospectus.   -- Retain the prohibition, only with respect to the Investment CompanyRule, against a broker receiving compensation in the form of securities.   -- Prohibit, with some exceptions, NASD members and associated personsfrom accepting, directly or indirectly, any non-cash compensation inconnection with the sale of investment company and variable contractsecurities.   -- Prohibit, again with certain exceptions, an associated person fromaccepting cash sales incentives for the sale of investment company orvariable contract securities.   Separately, the NASD has also submitted new rules to the SEC designed toeliminate potential confusion by investors purchasing mutual funds andsimilar products on the premises of banks, savings and loans, credit unionsand other financial institutions other than broker/dealers.   The new rule would require NASD member firms, among other things, toconduct business in a location distinct from the area where retail depositsare taken whenever possible; provide customers with a written documentoutlining differences in insurance coverage and risks for securities andinstitution deposits; and prohibit member firms from making payments,including referral fees, to individuals employed by the financialinstitution who are not registered with the member firm.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NBROADCASTING ANALYST JOINS SCHRODER WERTHEIMBy:Heike Wipperfurth   Eric Stewart last week joined Schroder Wertheim & Co. as a broadcastanalyst, expanding the research coverage of its media group.

Cited first by the exchange was the linkage agreement between Liffe andthe Chicago Board of Trade, which was formally signed just last month aftermonths of prior negotiations.   Liffe noted that the linkage will provide market users with increasedaccess to major government debt futures and options products on both sidesof the Atlantic during U.S. and European business hours. Initially, thelinkage will include Liffe's German government bond (bund) contract and theCBT's U.S. Treasury bond contract, which are scheduled to begin trading inthe second quarter of this year.   Next, the exchange said, in April of this year it will commence anotherlinkage with the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange that, underan agreement signed last year, will begin the trading of a fungiblethree-month Euroyen futures contract.   Also slated for this year is a merger between Liffe and the LondonCommodity Exchange, which the exchange said will be the first step in``providing a platform for the development of a liquid European time zoneagricultural and soft commodity complex in London.''   In an effort to maintain a leading technological edge, Liffe noted thatthis month it would launch its APT trading system for options, a move itsaid would create the first fully functional screen-based options tradingsystem in the world.   Other technological initiatives, the exchange said, include thedevelopment of its so-called LOTS system, designed to provide theindustry's first comprehensive electronic business processing system, andthe development of an unnamed automated system for its equity optionscomplex.   Finally, the exchange noted that an agreement has been reached withLondon Stock Exchange for Liffe to lease the LSE's former trading floor,office and storage space, which will allow it to meet its medium-termneeds.   Like other exchanges around the world last year, Liffe suffered a dropin volume compared with the prior record year, but still had its secondbusiest year ever.

This forms part of the MITI's overallstrategy to promote a wider range of applications for electroniccommerce.According to Visa, the pilot of the Smart Commerce Japan project willinvolve the distribution of 35,000 chip cards which will conform to theEMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) specifications, together withcompact stored-value card readers, to current Visa cardholders who haveexperience using the Internet.A source at Visa Japan told SCB that other Internet projects are alsobeing conceived by the ministry. Following the test of Smart CommerceJapan, it is expected the MITI will develop other electronic datainterchange (EDI) type systems for the Internet.Other systems being envisioned will facilitate the exchange oftrade-related information between individuals and corporations on theInternet, with later systems allowing similar exchanges betweencorporations.The Smart Commerce Japan project is slated for a pilot debut in thefirst quarter of 1997. It is believed to be the world's first system tocombine the EMV-compatible integrated chip card for electroniccommerce. Other payment systems available on the Internet are based onconventional magnetic stripe technology.The project will allow Visa cardholders to use their card not only forcredit and debit transactions but also for stored-value transactions onthe Internet. Cardholders might even be able to load up theirreloadable stored-value cards on special terminals in their homes.Team leader of Smart Commerce Japan, Toshiba Corporation, said theproject will promote electronic shopping and put powerful chip cardsinto the hands of thousands of Japanese consumers.The project is undertaken by a consortium headed by Toshiba and willalso involve international credit card association, Visa International,Daiei Group, Japan's largest retailer and the Hankyu Toho Group, adiversified entertainment, retail and transportation group.A spokesperson for Toshiba said the company's role in the project willinvolve the provision of system integration from the EMV compatiblechip card and related devices to back-end servers.According to Visa, the lack of security for financial transactions overopen networks has hampered the development of electronic commerce. Toovercome this constraint, Toshiba and Visa have revealed that they willbe working to develop hardware applications to facilitate securepayment over the Internet. It is expected that when the pilot commencesin the first quarter of 1997, a common application standard willalready be in place.Visa International had earlier partnered software giant, Microsoft, todevelop Secure Transaction Technology (STT), an open standard forsecurity and payment applications. Visa would not confirm whetherMicrosoft are involved in the Japanese project.A source at MasterCard, the other international card associationcurrently developing a standard for secured Internet paymenttransactions, said: "It is perplexing that for Internet transactions,which are global in nature, it is necessary to create a Japanesestandard for secured payment. We will certainly be watching thisproject with interest."The source at Visa, however, said there is no intention to create aJapanese standard for secured transactions. "The objective is not tocreate a de facto standard, if another standard comes out and is wellaccepted, we will use that. But what we do want to create isinternational operability. There will eventually be a commonality ofstandards between what Visa and MasterCard are attempting to do."A spokesman for Toshiba said: "We will adopt a world-standard securitytechnology, which is compatible with the settlement system forEMV-based IC cards."It is understood that Toshiba will co-operate with NetscapeCommunications Corporation, a leading Internet-related softwareprovider, to develop the Internet platform for the project. It willalso develop the system for EMV chip transactions over the Internet, aswell as the Sun Microsystems' Java-based interface software between theEMV chip card and the transaction system.Visa said that, during the pilot, experiments will be conducted to findways to deliver the convenience of shopping in cyberspace to those whodo not own a home PC, such as the construction of"Virtual Mall Kiosks"placed in convenient locations. Several credit card issuers, majorretailers and Japan's leading banks will be involved in the pilot.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

According to Jones, Stewart will be a "relationship managerfor all of the Americas", with Canada, the US and other nationalsubsidiaries reporting through his office."We'd like to get Canada and the US operational on an integrated basisand then expand southward," to Latin America, Stewart told SCB in arecent interview. Stewart has a business as well as technicalbackground from his days with AT&T's Bell Laboratories, where he wasinvolved with research and development."If you're dealing with North American corporations, it's important tohave someone on the ground, in the same time zone, available formeetings at short notice. He'll sweep the whole load of issues. We havemore people wanting to talk to us than we can cope with at the moment,"Jones said, though he declined to identify the banks involved.In the US, to date, Mondex has encountered heavy resistance and has notyet been embraced. Detractors claim that US regulators will neverauthorise Mondex because it is harder to audit and control centrally.Mondex is the only electronic purse scheme that proposes card-to-cardtransfers between users without requiring that transactions be routedthrough a central clearing mechanism. This will only encourage taxevasion and money laundering, critics have said.But Stewart said he was optimistic that regulators at the office forComptroller of the Currency and the federal Reserve Board would beconvinced of security and integrity of the Mondex scheme.In mid-1995, Mondex got its first foothold in the US at Wells FargoBank, which initiated a test among fewer than 100 employees. Jones saidhe hopes the $50 billion-asset San Francisco bank will roll out thesystem and become a charter member of the Mondex USA franchise.Elsewhere, according to an industry observer, NationsBank and NBDMichigan (National Bank of Detroit) are said to be in discussions withMondex. Spokesmen from the two banks declined to comment.There is also speculation that Midland Marine Bank of Buffalo willparticipate, since it is owned by the UK Midland Bank, the otherfounder of Mondex.In another significant development last month, National WestminsterGroup, which created Mondex in conjunction with Midland Group, sold NewJersey-based subsidiary NatWest Bancorp.The bank, which owns retail branches in the New York City area and acredit card bank based in Delaware, was purchased by Fleet FinancialGroup of Boston in a cash deal worth $3.26 billion. Jones said it hadbeen pretty obvious that NatWest USA would be an important part ofMondex USA, but that discussions have already begun with Fleet.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"On the one hand, we are helping our Spanishcounterparts to actually set up their own electronic purse and, on theother hand, we are providing, on a more general level, basic know-howand information to countries as diverse as Israel, Brazil, the UK,France and Canada".She added that the Spanish electronic purse project should be up andrunning by mid-1996."Both SIBS and the Spanish banking sector are keento make the two systems mutually acceptable, which means the Portuguesewill be able to use their electronic purse in Spain, and vice versa.SIBS says the number of electronic purses in circulation is risingfaster than had been expected. Luis Cid, head of SIBS, recently toldjournalists that Portugal issued in the month of October alone what ittook the Danish three years to achieve.However, he conceded that the numbers are still well below the 10million cards SIBS expects to be in circulation within the next fiveyears.SIBS has already sold around 360,000 cards to the country's banks.Until October 1995, over 100,000 cards were in circulation, with atotal loaded value of Esc174 million ($1.16 million). In the sameperiod, there were 7,028 POS terminals in operation, 4,343 of whichwere off-line terminals exclusively for the electronic purse. Of thisnumber, 43 had been integrated into vending machines of various kinds.The value of the average payment transaction (of which there were over685,000 in the first nine months of the electronic purse's career) isEsc370 ($2.5), which substitute for petty cash payments.SIBS also says that the upgrading of the country's ATMs to acceptelectronic purse loading facilities is virtually completed and that theelectronic purse will be usable nationwide within two years.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

At the moment,these purchases are carried out from a distance (by telephone, fax,minitel or ordinary mail) in 90 percent of cases.Every Carte Bleue member bank will be able to market the purchasingservice, and to personalise it, should it wish to do so, in order tosatisfy the requirements of its client companies.The purchasing system, as it is defined today, will work from a commonoperational core, which will have to evolve in order to become richeras its market develops both nationally and internationally.In 1994, the Groupement Carte Bleue conducted two studies of the waypotential customer firms viewed the service. What emerged from them wasthat 38 percent of those surveyed expressed an interest in the service.A study carried out in 1994 by Andersen Consulting evaluated the Frenchpotential for service purchasing to be more than Fr110 billion, butonly took into account the market involving the country's 500 largestfirms in terms of turnover.Jean-Marc Bornet, the chief executive of Carte Bleue, told CI that hehad great confidence in the future of the purchasing service: "Thequestion arose as to whether the purchasing service would beexperimented jointly once it had appeared in the Carte Bleue catalogue,but the Groupement finally decided against this."French banks will, in fact, start off with the new product at theirown individual pace. It should be remembered that a large number oftelematic services are already offered to companies by French banks,and the role of the purchasing service is to enrich the servicesalready available".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

However, central bank regulators in the country haveexpressed reservations about a possible loss of revenue if stored-valuecards (SVC) take off.According to a report published by Visa International, called Payments2001, the number of chip-based cards in Australia will swell to 27million by the year 2001. Meanwhile, the number of consumers holdingcards is expected to rise to 2.8 million by the same year.One of the greatest breakthroughs that will be facilitated by smartcards is the ability to load funds on to the card at home. This couldbe the catalyst for a massive increase in the use of home bankingservices, said the report.The Australian market also has the benefit of a sophisticatedtelecommunications infrastructure. "The hurdles to connectivity arealready coming down. One fundamental is the broad band cable which isbeing laid through Australian suburbs and which will not only provideAustralians with Pay TV but also all the utility of two-way datacommunication in cyberspace."In a survey conducted by Visa, Australian consumers were asked toevaluate three stored-value options - a disposable card, a stand-alonereloadable card and a multifunction card. The survey found that 72percent of respondents favoured some form of stored-value function. Ofthat figure, 44 percent want the chip embedded on their existingcredit/debit/ATM card. However, a substantial 37 percent preferred adisposable card, while the remaining 19 percent opted for a reloadablecard.Interestingly, disposable cards were preferred by those consumers whothought of buying the cards for family and friends as gifts. "Almost 50percent of Australian consumers would buy disposable cards for someoneelse, and 40 percent would buy stand-alone reloadable cards forothers."Another finding of the report was that 88 percent of consumers wantedthe capability to reload value onto their SVC at any ATM or eftposdevice and about 46 percent wanted the option of reloading the card athome through a special device.Identifying and signing the right merchants was given as an essentialrequirement for the success of stored-value cards. Petrol stations werehighlighted as the most important, with 61 percent saying they wantedto use their card there. Meanwhile, 60 percent identified grocerystores, 40 percent pointed to payphones, 34 percent buses and trains,and 29 percent mentioned post offices.One issue which has not been resolved is the reaction of regulators toa potentially radical shift in the means of payments. At the moment,central banks earn money from issuing notes and coins, calledseigniorage.According to Ray Jones, assistant secretary of the business finance andsuperannuation branch of the Australian Federal Reserve: "The fiscalimpact of stored value cards will depend upon the speed and extent oftheir market penetration. A sudden loss of a substantial revenue streamwould naturally have some public finance implications, but whether thisis a likely outcome is by no means clear at the moment."According to Ian Harper in an article in The Australian FinancialReview, "they [stored-value] represent the first real threat to the useof currency notes and coins in everyday payments. The bank and theTreasury fear this may at last be about to change. And they have muchto lose."However, he went on to say "there does not appear to be any significantdownward trend in seigniorage earned by the banks", but he attributedthis to the fact that stored-value cards are in their infancy.Harper predicts that the Reserve Bank will not allow this revenuestream disappear if stored-value does take off. "The bank also earnsseigniorage by obliging banks to hold compulsory reserves with it andpaying them low rates of interest or none at all. The trouble is thatbanks might not be the main players in stored-value cards."The real worry for the Reserve Bank and the Treasury is the prospectof multiple issuers which have no connection with the banking system atall and no reason to pay seigniorage to the Reserve Bank," said Harper.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Since the appointment of a new management team in May 1991,the company has taken streamlining and other special pretax chargestotaling $196 million (including $38 million in the fourth quarter of1995), invested more than $200 million in equipment and plant expansions toposition itself for growth and productivity improvements, and made nineacquisitions having an aggregate purchase price of over $400 million.   The company maintains 14 printing plants, one warehouse, oneprepress/warehouse facility, five prepress facilities, onedistribution/bindery facility, two distribution centers, and one multimediafacility. The company supplies all of the ink and a substantial amount ofthe paper it uses. An extensive network of sales offices located throughoutthe U.S. is staffed by approximately 250 sales and marketingrepresentatives.   Assuming exercise of the overallotment option, KKR is sellingapproximately 12 million of the shares being offered, affiliates of MerrillLynch are selling about 2 million shares, and numerous less than onepercent holders are selling their shares. KKR's stake will be reduced to50.1% (approximately 49% assuming exercise of the overallotment option).Certain minority shareholders have agreed not to sell any of theirremaining shares for 120 days after the close of the offering, and thecompany, KKR, and remaining stockholders have agreed not to do so for 180days. As of October 1, 1995, debt was 59% of total capital. In 1995,lenders increased the maximum available under the company's creditfacilities, of which about $89 million remains available.   Since 1991, the actions of the new management have resulted in asignificant improvement in profitability. Measured by adjusted operatingincome margin which excludes steamlining and other special charges,profitability has increased from 3.4% of revenues in 1991 to 7.1% in thefirst nine months of 1995. This has occurred despite that revenue growthover that time has largely been derived from acquisitions and increases inpaper prices, offset to some extent by higher paper costs.   Because of the company's substantial leverage, we think free cash flowis a good method of valuation. Importantly, cash flow has been adequate topay down a substantial amount of acquired debt. The company projectscapital expenditures in 1996 will total $75 million and scheduled debtprincipal payments total $21 million, leaving free cash flow by ourestimate of about $20.5 million, or $0.60 a share. We also expect free cashflow will increase an average 40% annually over the next several years asdebt is repaid. Discounting projected free cash flow at the riskfree rate,the stock price could increase 100% to 125% over a five year period. In theshort term we see the stock climbing to 22 to 24. We recommend purchase ofthe shares as a long term holding.Underwriters: Donaldson, Lufkin; CS First Boston; Morgan Stanley;PaineWebber; Smith Barney. Offering: 13,780,328 com. shs.

The New York MTA,with 26.8 million people, has the highest population of any MTA in thenation. The FCC determined the company's license fee at 85% of the averageper population price of the winning bids for the top 23 MTAs, times the NewYork MTA's population. The company has been accruing interest on thisobligation at the prime rate and expects interest only payments to begin in1996. The company is also participating in the Entrepreneurs' Band Auctionfor small businesses for additional PCS licenses in each of the 493 BasicTrading Areas.   The Omnipoint System has been designated by a key industry standardsetting group as IS-661. IS-661 is one of four technical common airinterfaces (CAI) competing for adoption by PCS license holders, the othersbeing PCS-1900, a system similar to the digital wireless standard commonacross Europe and adopted in many other countries, CDMA, and TDMA, both ofwhich are being upbanded to the 1900 MHz section of the radio spectrum fromcurrent cellular technologies.   Each CAI has its proponents among equipment manufacturers and serviceproviders. The Omnipoint System, as the company proposes to implementIS-661, is a hybrid system that will interface with PCS-1900 based systems.It also incorporates certain coding features of CDMA between cell sites,but uses timing features of TDMA within cells to separate channels. Thecompany expects that initial capital costs to deploy a commercial IS-661system, incremental capital costs per subscriber, and ability to rapidlyscale up a system as demand grows, will enable it to offer a variety ofwireless services at lower costs than current cellular and wirelinecompetitors.   The company has entered into or committed to agreements with NorthernTelecom for Omnipoint to buy, and for Telecom to sell infrastructureequipment and finance system buildout, up to $612 million. It has alsoentered into a series of agreements with Ericsson for, among other things,the development of dual mode IS-661/PCS-1900 handsets. The agreementsobligate the company to purchase $250 million of infrastructure equipmentand $100 million of handsets from Ericsson, which will provide up to $375million of vendor financing. Additional handset development, manufacturing,marketing and sale agreements have been entered into with JRC Internationaland Hansol Paper Co., the latter being primarily in Korea and other partsof Asia.   Proceeds from the offering will be used for interest payments on the NewYork MTA license, for development and marketing of Omnipoint technology andequipment, and in connection with additional PCS licenses, if any,purchased by the company. Other than the New York MTA license obligation,other debt as of September 30, 1995 totaled $26 million.   The three largest shareholders are Avance Capital, which will own 22% ofthe outstanding shares, Madison Dearborn Capital Partners, L.P. 16%, andAllen & Co. 9.7%. Insiders and their affiliates in the aggregate willcontrol 64% of the stock. About 1.2 million shares will be eligible forsale in the public market beginning 90 days after the offering closes, and26.4 million upon expiration of the underwriter's 180 day lockup period.   Although IS-661 has obtained separate CAI designation, IS-661 systemsare designed to be compatible with PCS-1900 systems. PacBell and BellSouth, which will construct PCS-1900 systems in certain license areas, havetentatively agreed to provide each others' subscribers with roamingcapability in the others' license areas. The company expects to have apilot system in operation in New York City in the first half of 1996, andto begin wider deployment by the end of the year.   Significant revenues will not occur until 1997, even if all goesaccording to plan, which it will likely not, judging by the experience ofother wireless service firms. We believe losses will be sustained through1999. Nevertheless, based on per POP valuations of wireless services firms,we think the stock price will initially rise from the 13 to 15 rangeproposed for the offering, but is likely to be volatile as quarterlyresults exceed or fall short of expectations.

The company exited the retail arenain early 1994, which was conducted primarily through the Computerlandfranchise business.   The current business strategy is predicated on the belief that themarket for outsourced PC network services is growing at a compound annualrate of more than 14%, and that profitability can grow at a faster ratebecause the valued added services which comprise a growing percentage ofthe company's business have higher margins than the traditional serviceswhich it provided, such as product procurement and repair and maintenance.   The company's technical workforce currently exceeds 2,200 employeesnationwide, including a rapidly expanding systems engineering force, whichgrew from about 200 in March 1994 to over 600 as of October 1995. Thecompany will seek to expand its business globally by entering strategicalliances with international partners. Over the past four quarters, about225 customers purchased products and services totaling at least $1 million.The domestic sales network as of October 31, 1995 consisted of over 540field sales and service representatives. A variety of service automationsoftware products have been implemented to reduce the cost and enhance thedelivery of the services to the customer. Products from over 700 vendorsare provided.   Proceeds from the sale of eight million shares for the company will beused to repay debt. The company maintains a $425 million credit facilitywith IBM Credit Corp. at prime plus 1.06%. As of July 31, 1995, long termdebt would have been 70% of committed capital on a pro forma basis,however, this is somewhat misleading since a large portion of the creditfacility is used to finance inventory.

Nynex obtained the shares when it sold the assetsof its Nynex Business Centers business to the company in fiscal 1991.Warburg Pincus Capital will own 35% of the stock after the offering.Although our copy of the prospectus was incomplete in regard to futuresales of stock, we assume that most of the currently outstanding shares aresubject to a 180 day underwriter's lockup agreement and Rule 144 volumelimitations.   The pressure to cut costs and eliminate non-core operations is likely tokeep the outsourcing trend intact over the next few years. We projectearnings growth at over 14% annually, but it is likely to be uneven. Giventhat 1995 PC sales were so strong, growth in 1996 is apt to be particularlyweak by comparison. We view the shares as fairly valued if offered at 111/2, but recommend purchase in anticipation of buy recommendations from theunderwriters, after which we would sell the shares.Underwriters: Robertson, Stephens; Alex.

About 80% ofthe documents generated each year are not needed for frequent reference,and can be considered inactive records, for which it provides storageservices in 66 facilities in 25 markets across the U.S. containing anaggregate of 4.9 million square feet of space.   As of September 30, 1995, Iron Mountain stored approximately 21 million1.2 cubic foot cartons for 14,000 customers. New customers are obtained bya dedicated sales force. An ongoing fee is collected for storage, andnonrecurring fees are charged for storage materials and services, such asdocument retrieval. The company also provides vital records services foritems such as master audio and video recordings, and provides courierservices via a fleet of approximately 200 vehicles. We believe that growthin the number of documents generated and outsourcing of document storageactivities has resulted in an increase in the number of cartons storedwhich has outpaced the 4% attrition rate experienced by the company due todestruction or permanent removal. Internal growth has been augmented byadditions of new customers and acquisitions of other document storagebusinesses.   Proceeds from the shares sold on the company's behalf will be used toredeem a warrant, fund several pending acquisitions and repay debt incurredfor other recently completed acquisitions. Long term debt on a pro formabasis as of September 30, 1995 was 64% of total capital. About $17 millionwas subsequently borrowed to fund recently completed acquisitions. CEORichard Reese will own 16% of the stock outstanding after the offering, andVincent J. Ryan will control 36%, including 20% held by Schooner CapitalCorp. The sellers are Schooner, Chase Manhattan Investment Holdings, andSecurity Pacific Capital Investors, L.P. A small number of shares becomeeligible for sale in the public market beginning 90 days after theoffering, but most of the currently outstanding shares are subject to a 180day (360 day in the case of Ryan and Schooner) underwriter's lockupagreement.   Although there will be about $47 million of additional borrowingcapacity available under the company's credit agreement, we believe thatfurther leverage would necessitate the curtailment of planned capitalexpenditures. It already appears that current obligations have beenextended to maintain debt levels at their current level. If additional debtis assumed for more acquisitions, as is the company's plan, we think thatit will have difficulty meeting interest and scheduled principal repaymentsafter 1998. Scheduled payments this year of about $2 million, and of $3.3million and $3.4 million in 1997 and 1998 should not be a problem, but the$8.3 million payment in 1999 becomes difficult if the balance sheet isleveraged further.   How did the company get into its current financial position? We thinkit overpaid for the businesses it has acquired, paying about 2.1X revenues,which is the same ratio of our 1996 revenue projection to the proposedmarket capitalization of equity plus debt.

SCA is characterized by rapid and irregular heart beat, orventricular fibrillation, in which the heart's normal electrical signalsbecome disorganized and erratic, causing the heart to cease pumping bloodwithin a few minutes. Defibrillation involving the application of anelectric shock to the heart, causing it to resume a regular rhythm, isnecessary to prevent death from SCA. It has been documented that timelydefibrillation can boost the survival rate from SCA to over 70%. Oftenparamedics or emergency medical technicians (EMTs) equipped and trained inthe use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) do not arrive on sitequickly enough, resulting in average SCA survival rates in the U.S. of 5%.AEDs use computer technology to interpret the patient's heartbeat todetermine if defibrillation is necessary. This contrasts with hospitalbased defibrillation units with which most people are familiar, thatrequire medical personnel to interpret an electrocardiogram.   This company has developed and clinically tested an AED which itbelieves is easier to use and maintain, requires less training, and costsless than current AEDs in use. The American Heart Association (AHA) hasendorsed the training and use of AEDs by ``first responders'', i.e. policeand fire personnel in addition the paramedics and EMTs, and The Departmentof Transportation has adopted guidelines which include AED training forEMTs beginning in 1995. The goal is that police and fire personnel, whotypically are on the scene prior to medical personnel, can administer AEDin a timely manner. Also, EMTs, who usually receive substantially lesstraining than paramedics, are typically not trained in the use of AEDs dueto the expense of training and purchasing AEDs for EMT ambulances.   The company has conducted two clinical trials which show no differencein efficacy between its AED, called the ForeRunner, and AEDs currently onthe market. The trials actually measured the efficacy of a method ofdelivering the electric shock that uses lower energy relative to thestandard higher energy AEDs currently in use. A 510(k) application to theFDA was submitted in December 1995 for clearance to market the ForeRunneron the basis that it is substantially equivalent to AEDs that have been onthe market since before 1976.   Proceeds from the offering and cash on hand, which together on a proforma basis totaled $49 million as of September 30, 1995, will be used tofund product introduction, to build a sales and marketing organization, forcontinuing research and development, and for working capital and generalcorporate purposes. Long term obligations are nominal. Four venture fundgroups will own 5% or more of the stock to be outstanding after theoffering, including entities affiliated with Mayfield Fund 23%, OakInvestment Partners 7%, Weiss, Peck & Greer 6%, and Medical Innovation FundII, L.P. 5%. Insiders in the aggregate will own 37%. Future sales of nearlyall of the shares currently outstanding are subject to a 180 dayunderwriter's lockup agreement and Rule 144 volume limitations.   Despite the submission of a 510(k) application to the FDA, we mustclassify this offering as speculative. The FDA may require additionalclinical data or may rule that the ForeRunner does not qualify for pre-1976device equivalency. The ForeRunner has never been tested in the field. Thelow energy electrical stimulation which it uses does not meet current AHAguidelines, and certain states have additional laws regarding which AEDsmay be used. The company and five of its founding employees are subject toa lawsuit brought by their former employer alleging misappropriation oftrade secrets and tortious interference with business relations. Even ifall these issues are resolved, we believe it will take at least three orfour years for the company to become profitable.

Among the services which the companyprovides are Phase I clinical testing, laboratory analysis, Phase II-IVclinical trial management, clinical data management and biostatisticalanalysis, treatment investigational new drug applications, medical writingand regulatory compliance, and health care economics and outcomesresearch.   In the nine months ended September 30, 1995, the pharmaceutical industryaccounted for 74% of net revenues, biotechnology 16%, the NationalInstitutes of Health 8%, and other 2%. Therapeutic areas from whichrevenues were derived were virology/AIDS/infectious diseases 30%,gastroenterology/metabolic diseases 27%, critical care 11%,pulmonary/allergy 11%, central nervous system 10%, and other 12%. AtSeptember 30, 1995, there were 165 active contracts with about 110 clientsin the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and the backlog was $50.2 million, versus$21.6 million a year earlier.   Contracts are based on specific project proposals developed by thecompany's business development personnel in response to potential clients'requests. We believe the contract cycle can be quite lengthy. Contracts areusually on a fixed price basis, so the company bears the risk of costoverruns. Senior management has experience with the regulatory process inprevious positions with Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham. At September 30,1995, 86 employees had post-graduate degrees.   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt incurred to make afinal S corporation distribution to current stockholders. Total debtoutstanding will equal 14% of total capitalization. The company will seekto renegotiate the terms and the amount of its credit facility. Insiderswill own 77% of the shares outstanding after the offering. Most of thecurrently outstanding shares become eligible for public sale under Rule 144after a 180 day lockup period.   We estimate revenues per employee in 1995 will be about $78,000, whichseems low. It is likely that the company has been adding significantnumbers of business development, research and other personnel, which havenot been reflected yet in revenue growth. This is supported by thesubstantial increase in backlog and in the rise in selling, general andadministrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 20.4% in 1993 to33.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 1995. The revenue per employeemay be misleading. Even so, we find it difficult to believe thatcompensation levels at the company are adequate to motivate professionalresearch personnel. A recently adopted stock option plan should aidemployee retention. The company has likely benefited in its hiring fromdownsizing of R&D staffs at major pharmaceutical firms that have beenacquired.   Still, we think that a business in which the overwhelming key to successis the performance of its employees in conducting research under fixedprice contracts, in which many variables can lead to unpredictable resultsand cost overruns, and which is not capital intensive, is better suited tobe a privately held entity. Minority shareholders are apt to find theirinterests do not always come first. Moreover, at 30X our $0.50 EPS for 1996on revenues of $55 million (with 24% more shares outstanding), whichrepresent 43% and 47% gains over projected EPS of $0.35 (pro forma forincome tax provision) and revenues of $37.5 million, we believe the sharesare amply valued.

Examples include voice mail andautomated call routing. Increasingly, computer telephony integrationapplications are being developed for more important transactions such asbrokerage orders and mail order pharmaceuticals, for example. Voice recordshave long been kept for critical communications such as emergency responsecenters and air traffic control facilities. Organizations' growing need torecord, process, and store large amounts of voice data has resulted in theintroduction of digitally based voice logging systems that can handle largevolumes of calls at lower costs.   This Israeli based company's principal product, NiceLog, can record,store and retrieve up to thousands of analog and digital telephone linesand radio channels, and enables simultaneous access by multiple users.NiceLog incorporates enhanced digital networking and voice processingtechnologies in the areas of computer telephony integration, digital signalprocessing, mass storage and database management. It uses an openarchitecture that provides connectivity options to networks such as Novell,IPX, and TCP/IP using DOS, Windows, Windows NT, and UNIX operating systems(a Windows 95 version is expected to be introduced in 1996), andtelecommunications interfaces such as T1, E1, ISDN, and analog trunks.   An add-on module, Call Logging System, enables prompt location andretrieval of data records according to several key record details, such astime of call, duration, extension number, and calling number. The companyhas sold hundreds of NiceLog units (each capable of handling 96 channels),to more than 150 users worldwide. A fax logger and a logging system forcustomers with requirements in the eight to 24 channel range are underdevelopment. The company also develops and sells communicationsintelligence systems, primarily the NiceFix, which enables users to detect,locate, and monitor transmissions, or ``get a fix'' on the transmittingobject, and provides engineering services for other defense applications.   The company primarily sells its products to distributors specializing inthe voice logging market. For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, 86%of total sales were to customers outside of Israel and 52% were tocustomers in the U.S. The company has arrangements with IPC InformationSystems and Etrali, two trading room switching equipment suppliers, tomarket its products, and with Northern Telecom and AspectTelecommunications to market the compatibility features of NiceLog withtheir automated call distribution systems. Contracts have been won tosupply up to 800 U.S. air traffic control centers with NiceLog systems overseven years and for the air traffic logging system at the new Hong Kongairport. These two contracts have a combined value of $3.4 million to $13million, for a period of one to seven years.   Proceeds will be used for working capital and other general corporatepurposes. The ordinary shares trade on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and on12/27/95 closed at 10 13/16. In October 1995, the company sold its 57%stake in NiceCom, a developer of advanced data communications switches, to3Com for $53 million, and subsequently paid dividends of $2.10 per share.No long term debt is outstanding. Insiders as a group will own 19% of theshares outstanding after the offering.   The U.S. air traffic system contract award is a major win because itgives credibility to the company in the U.S. Still, the company hasgenerally not been profitable, and despite the contract award, we do notthink the company's products have a clear technological advantage overcompeting systems. Most costs are recorded in New Israeli Shekels, whilemost sales are made in, and the reporting currency is, dollars. Israeliinflation in recent years has exceeded the rate of devaluation of theshekel against the dollar, thereby lowering dollar earnings. This and thedividends paid after the sale of NiceCom made the shares more attractive toIsraeli investors, who may have pushed up the stock price, despite the lackof dollar profits.   It is not assured that a liquid market will develop for the ADSs. Therecent dollar equivalent share price in Tel Aviv is about 23X our $0.45 EPSestimate for 1996. We do not believe this adequately discounts the risks ofbuying the stock, and we would avoid the shares.Underwriters: Lehman Brothers; Oppenheimer. Offering: 2,000,000 ADSs (allby the company).

It also owns a 44% interest in a newlyformed management services organization for a physician association basedin Connecticut of over 240 multi-specialty physicians and has a 50%interest in a medical facility development company. The business is theconglomeration of several physician management firms operated under commoncontrol by CEO Abraham D. Gosman, who is also CEO of Meditrust and foundedThe Mediplex Group, which was acquired by Sun Healthcare Group in June1994.   Several factors are combining to put the solo physician or smallpartnership practice at a disadvantage to management organizations. Forexample, the information systems that are necessary to respond to therequirements of managed care organizations and the Medicare and Medicaidprograms are costly and usually beyond the means of most practices. Byjoining a physician management organization, physicians can cut costs andreduce the volatility of their earnings. In other words, the changingpayment structure of the U.S. healthcare system has made the practicemanagement model a better deal for most physicians. Healthcare reformsbeing proposed should only bring more pressure to bear on physicians tojoin management groups.   Up to $32 million of offering proceeds will be used to repayindebtedness to Mr. Gosman and about $50 million will be used to repayobligations guaranteed by, or to substitute for collateral provided byGosman. On a pro forma basis, long term debt would be 18% of total capital.The company is negotiating to obtain an acquisition/working capital line ofcredit. Gosman will own 40% of the stock outstanding after the offering.All of the shares to be issued to him and other management and foundingstockholders are subject to the holding requirement of the Securities Act,and may not be sold in the open market until the second anniversary of theclosing date of the offering.   The company intends to pursue an aggressive acquisition strategy, sofuture results may vary substantially from our estimates. Industryfundamentals favor physician management organizations, and because only asmall percentage of the approximate 650,000 physicians in the nation havejoined a management group, we think there are ample acquisition candidates.As the company brings more physicians within its structure, it will realizeeconomies of scale and cost efficiencies will result in much improvedmargins.   We are projecting a pro forma loss for 1995 of $0.20 a share on revenuesof $128 million, including a $2.5 million charge in the fourth quarter towrite down certain acquired assets at their book value. In 1996, ourforecast is $160 million in revenues and EPS of $0.25. Tentatively in 1997,revenues could top $200 million, and EPS could more than double.

Thiscompany markets and distributes repair and maintenance products principallyto the apartment housing market, and in 1995 initiated sales to thehospitality, health care, and institutional markets.   The primary marketing tool is the Wilmar Master Catalog, containing over14,000 skus of standard and specialty plumbing products, 36% of sales inthe first nine months of 1995, electrical 19%, hardware 16%, chemical andjanitorial 6%, appliance parts 5%, window and floor coverings 5%, HVAC 5%,paint and accessories 4%, and other products 4%. The catalog iscomplemented by a local direct sales force in 34 markets and a telesalesforce in other markets which maintain frequent contact with the company's19,500 active customers. These efforts are augmented by national andregional accounts serviced by senior management and by participation inBuyers Access, a group purchasing organization of apartment propertymanagement firms. Members of Buyers Access accounted for 23% of sales inthe nine months ended September 30, 1995.   The company operates 10 distribution centers and offers next daydelivery for orders over $25, either by its own trucks or a contractservice. The company has found that customers order significantly more inareas in which it offers next day delivery. Standard or customized billingservices can be provided, and electronic order access is available. Thecompany has developed foreign sourcing of a broad array of private labelproducts, which accounted for 18% of net sales in the first nine months of1995.   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay all company debt andredeem all outstanding preferred stock. In March 1995, CEO William Green,the sole stockholder at the time, sold a substantial interest in thecompany to Summit Investors. Additional funding was borrowed to completethe November 1995 acquisition of One Source, operator of a supplydistribution business in Miami, for $3.7 million. As a result of therecapitalization, Green and Summit Investors have withdrawn $28 million incapital from the company.   Green will convert $5 million of preferred stock into common shares atthe offering price, giving him a 28% interest after the offering. SummitInvestors paid $55,000 for their 3.1 million shares, or 32% interest. Salesof additional shares of common stock to the public are subject to a 180 dayunderwriter's lockup agreement, although sales of the shares purchased bythe Summit Investors do not become eligible for sale under Rule 144 untilMarch 1997, unless the SEC amends the Rule to cut the holding period fromtwo to one years. Such an amendment is under consideration.   We think the key to the company's growth has been the value addedservices which it provides to property managers. Many properties areheavily leveraged or under capitalized, so maintaining a repair andmaintenance products inventory is just one more headache. The companysolves this problem, and we believe most competing firms do not provide asimilar breadth of products and services.   We think the company will continue to grow, gaining market share andforcing out weaker, local firms. It made its first acquisition only lastNovember at a fraction of the value which the underwriters have placed onthe firm. Other acquisitions at favorable prices are likely to be availablefor some time. Geographic expansion and new end market penetration alsopresent strong growth opportunities. The hospitality, health care, andinstitutional markets accounted for only 1.5% of net sales in the firstnine months of 1995. We believe the company covers less than 50% of thenation currently. On a pro forma basis assuming the acquisition occurred atthe beginning of 1995, we estimate EPS was $0.45 a share on sales of $72.5million. Pro forma assuming the offering and related transactions occurredon 1/1/96, we project EPS of $0.60 on sales of $90 million. It is stillearly in the IPO cycle for outsourcing firms, which typically means thatthe success of the first offering raises the valuation standard until thequality of firms looking to capitalize on the trend deteriorates.

IPO   Simultaneous with the consummation of the offering, this company willacquire the seven companies, all of which provide document managementservices primarily to health care institutions, professional services (suchas legal services) firms, and financial institutions. One or more of thefounding firms provide micrographic services, electronic image processing,active document and file storage and maintenance, inactive documentarchival storage, and information and database management services. Theseservices are provided for all three target markets.   In addition, certain of the companies provide medical records releaseservices to health care institutions, litigation support to professionalservices firms, and remittance processing to financial institutions. Thefounding companies have been in business an average of 22 years and operate33 facilities in 21 states. Selling is conducted at the local level,typically by senior management, but the company expects to add a directsales force where appropriate.   Proceeds from the offering will be used to pay the cash portion of thepurchase price for the founding companies, to repay debt, and for generalcorporate purposes including acquisitions. Future acquisitions are likelyto be financed wholly or in part with common stock. Long term debt isnominal. Negotiations are ongoing with a leading financial institution forlines of credit in the aggregate amount of $25 million to be used foradditional acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes.   Insiders will own 39% of the stock after the offering. All of thestockholders of the company, including the former owners of the foundingcompanies will be contractually prohibited from selling any of the sharesfor a period of two years after the acquisitions are closed. Recently, inNovember 1995, Ed H. Bowman, Jr. was appointed CEO of the company. Mr.Bowman's previous experience was with First Data, HBO & Co., and AndersenConsulting. Chief Development Officer Thomas C. Walker has been responsiblefor the acquisition or divestiture of over 100 businesses over a 29 yearperiod.   We think that the value added services which the company provides is amore attractive business than the archival storage business of IronMountain, another firm which is planning an IPO. Both firms are likely tobenefit from the growing trend for businesses to outsource their documentmanagement operations and from consolidation within the industry. Moreimportantly, F.Y.I.'s proposed market capitalization is about 1.2X ourprojection of 1996 revenues for the founding companies, versus the 2.1X atwhich Iron Mountain is seeking to sell shares. Our pro forma combined EPSestimate for 1995 is $0.85 on revenues of $47.5 million. Assumingacquisitions add about $10 million in revenue in 1996, we project totalrevenues of $65 million and EPS of $0.90 on 37% more shares outstanding.

Coyle, CFAJanuary 9, 1996Investment opinion   We are recommending the purchase of SGS-THOMSON as a low-risk way tobenefit from the strong demand expected in the semiconductor industry overthe next several years. Semiconductor stocks have been hammered in recentmonths as investors have chosen to take profits in light of weaker thanexpected results being reported by several companies, and amid signs ofpricing pressures in the highly visible memory segment. However, we do notbelieve these factors portend an overall slowdown in the market, but ratherreflect isolated pockets of weakness in certain segments of the industry.   SGS-THOMSON should continue to prosper in this uncertain environment, asits product and geographic diversity makes it less susceptible to the risksof more narrowly focused semiconductor companies. In addition, thisdiversity gives us confidence in revenue and earnings visibility, a factorthat should be highly prized by investors during 1996.   Finally, the volatility seen in the last several months underscores theneed for careful investment selection in this group. As such, we recommendfocusing on stocks that are not overly exposed to one industry or productline and that can be purchased at a low multiple to future earnings.SGS-THOMSON meets this criteria at just 7.4X our estimate for 1996 andshould be purchased by investors seeking above-average capitalappreciation.Overview   SGS-THOMSON is a leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips and devicesfor a variety of end markets. The company sports a diversified line-up ofsome 3000 products that are sold to more than 1500 customers, includingOEMs in the computer systems (27% of sales in 1995's first nine months),telecommunications (23%), consumer products (19%), industrial (21%) andautomotive (10%) industries. Revenues are also well balanced globally,with Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Japan accounting for 47%, 25%,24% and 4%, respectively, of revenues in 1995's first nine months.   The company's principal focus is on differentiated products (51% ofrevenues in 1995's first nine months), a segment which mainly containsanalog and mixed-signal (analog/digital) integrated circuits (ICs). AnalogICs provide the critical link between electronic systems and a variety ofvariables including sound, light, temperature or speed. Mixed-signalcircuits combine analog and digital functionality on a single-chip toprocess both analog signals and digital data. During 1994, SGS was the #1worldwide producer of analog and mixed-signal devices.   Because of the close relationships needed with customers to designdifferentiated products, SGS-THOMSON is less vulnerable to pricingpressures than commodity producers. In addition, these products have longerlife cycles than commodity devices, are less susceptible to technologicalobsolescence and cost less to make as older and more reliable manufacturingprocesses can be employed. Market projections are for differentiatedproducts to grow at a 21% annual growth rate through 1998.   The balance of SGS's revenues are logic and memories (24% of revenuesin 1995's first nine months), discrete (16%), and standard & commodities(9%). The company's logic devices, which include microprocessors,microcontrollers and digital signal processors (DSPs), are generallydifferentiated from competitive offerings by patents and specializedproduct design skills. In contrast, the company's non-volatile memoryproducts (EPROMs, EEPROMs, SRAMs, flash memories, chips for smartcards) aregenerally considered more commodity in nature and mainly differentiated byprice. The company does not manufacture DRAM memory chips. During 1994, SGSwas the #2 worldwide producer of non-volatile memories.   SGS-THOMSON Holding II controls 69% of the outstanding shares and isequally owned by a consortium of French and Italian shareholders that areindirectly controlled by their respective governments.Targeted products should help drive top line growth   Despite its broad-based product portfolio, the company is also wellpositioned to benefit from exposure to several promising growth segments inthe semiconductor industry. MPEG (motion picture experts group) chips,which utilize advanced digital video compression to improve the quality ofvideo and audio, are gaining widespread acceptance in the fast-growingmultimedia computer segment. The company was the leading worldwide MPEG-2supplier in 1994 and market forecasts are for the MPEG market to reach $2billion in 1996, up from $600 million in 1995. The company is alsotargeting the fast growing flash memory market. Flash memories can beerased and reprogrammed electrically without having to be physicallyremoved from a system, like EPROMs. Because of their flexibility, low costand small size, the use of flash memories is expected to proliferate.According to In-Stat, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based research firm, the flashmemory market is expected to grow 32% in 1996 from about $1.3 billion in1995. Longer term, we expect the company to benefit from its licenseagreement with Cyrix. Under the agreement, the company has the option tomanufacture and sell Cyrix's line of microprocessors, including its highlytouted M1 chip that is set to challenge Intel's Pentium family. Volumeproduction is set for 1996's second quarter but any meaningful contributionis more likely to come in the 1997 time frame.SGS benefiting from strong industry demand   Revenues and earnings were up 40% and 37%, respectively, in the threemonths ended September 30, 1995, and 34% and 32% for the nine month period.The company has benefited from strong global demand for semiconductorsacross all key product categories and geographies. We are estimatingrevenue growth of about 25% in 1996, which assumes that the company willgrow in line with projected industry growth rates. The SemiconductorIndustry Association has forecast a 26% increase in worldwide semiconductorsales for 1996, but we believe the company's growth rate is likely to beslightly lower due to its lack of exposure to the fast-growing DRAMmarket.   Gross margins have trended down from the 42% rate experienced in 1994and the first quarter of 1995, mainly due to costs associated with capacityadditions. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by recent management commentsthat margins could range between 40% and 42% in 1996. Since margins arecurrently at the low end of this range, we have built in some upside in ourforecast with a 41% gross margin estimate.   The company continues to increase spending at healthy levels in aneffort to keep pace with growing demand. SG&A expenses grew as a percentageof sales in 1995, excluding a $15 million non-recurring item, owing togreater marketing efforts. The company continues to spend aggressively onresearch and development, a trend we view positively. We expect littlediversion from these spending trends in 1996, and have conservativelytargeted these categories to grow cumulatively at rates slightly below our25% earnings growth estimate.   We are forecasting earnings of $4.25 for 1996, up 12% from our $3.80estimate for 1995. The earnings gain is being restricted by an increase inthe tax rate to 26% from an estimated 20%. In 1995, SGS realized certain tax breaks from the initiation of capital expenditure programs in certaincountries. We also expect a 6% increase in the number of sharesoutstanding, reflecting the October 1995 public offering of 8.9 millionshares at US$43.50 a share.Company adding capacity to address demand   SGS-THOMSON is aggressively expanding manufacturing capacity over thenext several years to meet projected industry demand. The company hasapplied 1994 and 1995 investments to three new front-end fabricationplants, two of which are now in operation. In addition, two older plantsare being converted to process newer and larger wafer sizes. The company isexpected to use the proceeds of US$377 million from its October publicoffering to help fund these additions. Capital spending in 1995 is expectedto total some $900 million.Is it time to buy semiconductor stocks?   Semiconductor stocks went on a roller coaster ride in 1995, with animpressive surge seen from the beginning of the year through September. Astracked by the S&P Semiconductor Index, semiconductor stocks rose by morethan 70% during that time frame. This performance was then followed byextreme volatility and subsequent profit taking that saw many semiconductorissues fall by 30% to 40% from their highs. The S&P Semiconductor Indexfinished up only 35% for the year. Is the 1995 sell-off a harbinger ofthings to come for 1996?   We don't believe so. Industry fundamentals are in place for selectedsemiconductor issues to do very well in 1996. Our bias would be towards themore broadly diversified companies versus companies that are overly exposedto a particular industry, customer or product line. Furthermore, we wouldstay away from companies specializing on more price-sensitive, commodityproducts. We think this criteria is critical as pockets of softness arebeginning to surface in various segments of the market, particularly in thecommodity segment. We do not believe this portends a dramatic decline inthe demand for semiconductors, but rather a pause from the overheatedconsumption levels of 1995 and heightened uncertainty about longer termgrowth rates in key personal computer and telecommunications industries.Our view is that growth in these segments will remain strong, although notat the rates seen in previous years. In addition, the proliferation ofsemiconductors in automobiles, electronics and appliances should complementnicely the growth in PCs and phones. In summary, we expect semiconductorissues to remain volatile over the next several months, but for investorsto eventually revisit higher quality names that can prosper in thisfast-changing industry.Valuation   Valuations on all semiconductor issues have come down dramatically sincethe latter part of 1995, and many now sport single-digit P/E multiples on1996 earnings. While we believe many of these issues warrant this type ofmultiple because of imminent pricing pressures and the lack of cleanearnings visibility, other stocks have been unduly punished by overly harshinvestor sentiment towards the group.   We believe SGS-THOMSON is one of those issues, as its broadlydiversified product line and customer base will prove to be a bufferagainst periodic pockets of softness that inevitably surface in endmarkets. In our opinion, the company's diversity effectively lowers therisk of a customer or product driven event slowing sales and earningsmomentum. When coupled with the current low valuation on the shares, SGS islikely to be an investor favorite when positive sentiment returns to thegroup.   With the shares trading at just 7.4X our 1996 estimate of $4.25 a shareand down from the high of 57 1/2, we see a strong likelihood of P/Eexpansion as semiconductor stocks eventually return to favor. Based on ourfavorable long term views of the industry, we can easily rationalize a P/Emultiple of 10 on 1996 earnings, giving the shares a value of $42.50, up33% from current levels. We would also note that this valuation may proveconservative based on what we view as the company's 15%-20% long termgrowth rate. Based on the its low risk profile along with strong underlyinggrowth prospects, we recommend that investors accumulate the shares forabove average capital gains.SGS-THOMSON52 week range:                  $57 1/2 - 24 1/21994 EPS:                       $3.041995 est.

Lead products include BioTropin, authentic humangrowth hormone (hGH); and Oxandrin, an anabolic steroid approved in variousindications for weight gain.   BTG sells hGH overseas; the worldwide hGH market totals about $800million to $1 billion. The company markets Oxandrin domestically, and U.S.market could easily top $100 million. Both drugs are still in the earlystages of their product cycle and have yet to capture a meaningful share oftheir markets; revenue growth has substantial upside potential. The mostpromising pipeline drug is Androtest-SL, a sublingual form of testosterone,which is being prepared for a New Drug Application with the FDA. Androtest-SL will be marketed to hypogonadal males and men withtestosterone deficiencies. The U.S. market is valued at about $625 millionand is growing approximately 16% a year.   We predict revenue growth of 45%+ through 1997 and estimate earnings in1995 at break-even, those in 1996 at $0.15 per share, and $0.45 in 1997. As BTG turns cash-flow positive in 1996 and with over $12 million in cash,we doubt the company will see the need to do an offering of shares (all therage in biotechs these days) or raise capital through debt.   Our 12-month price target is $12 based on a reasonable price/earningsratio of 27X 1997 earnings. Considering that most publicly tradedbiotechnology companies, even 1995's success stories like AgouronPharmaceuticals and Cephalon have no immediate earnings expectations norany commercial drug products (no P/E's either), Bio-Technology General hasa compelling investment profile based on the fundamentals in thishigh-growth, high-risk sector.Overview   This small-cap biopharmaceutical develops and manufacturespharmaceuticals and genetically engineered products. BTG focuses on drugsthat treat endocrinology disorders, cardio/pulmonary diseases, opthalmic,and skin disorders. Through marketing partners and distribution agreements,the company sells its products in Western Europe, Japan, Israel, Canada,the U.S. and Mexico.   BTG's flagship drug is called Bio-Tropin, human growth hormone (hGH),and is used to treat short stature, growth hormone deficiency, anddwarfism. hGH is secreted from the pituitary gland and controls importantphysiological functions essential to normal development and maturation. Theworldwide market for hGH is very large, estimated between $850 million and$1 billion, and growing by about 10% each year. The major geographicmarkets are the U.S. with a $300 million market potential, Western Europeat $250 million, and Japan, slightly less than the U.S. Currently, BTG isselling Bio-Tropin in Western Europe and Japan through licensees, as wellas in other smaller markets in East Asia and Latin America.   Bio-Tropin accounted for approximately $7.2 million of BTG revenues in1994 (65% of the total) mostly through sales in Japan by licensee JCRPharmaceuticals. JCR began selling Bio-Tropin in mid-1993 and is startingto make inroads on capturing a more significant portion of the Japanesemarket. Sales contributions from its Western Europe market was slight in1994, as its licensee, the Ferring Group, had a late start: sales to theNetherlands, Germany, and Sweden commenced in 4Q 1994. During late 1995,Ferring started selling in the U.K., France, Spain, Denmark, Belgium,Ireland, and Luxembourg. The 1995 comparisons in both the Japan and WesternEurope market have been very favorable and as Bio-Tropin is still in a``launch stage'', projected growth rates are high. We estimate BioTropinsales from Japan in 1995 at $11 million and will grow about 15% through1997. In Western Europe, revenue contributions will approximate $2.3million in 1995 and grow at 45%+ through 1997.Problems with BioTropin in the United States may have clouded investors'perception of the stock   Unfortunately, BioTropin's biggest and most lucrative market, the UnitedStates, is closed off . After obtaining FDA approval to market Bio-Tropinin the United States, Genentech filed a suit claiming patent infringementand was able to prevent BTG from selling its hGH domestically. Genentechis, of course, trying to preserve market share of its own hGH drugs inAmerica. In August 1995, Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical was alsoslapped with a preliminary injunction by Genentech when it tried to sellhGH products in the U.S., as well. BTG has appealed the ruling and expectsa decision by March 1996. Although there is a good chance that the companycould succeed in overturning the injunction, we are not including thepossibility of U.S. sales in our earnings model. Whatever happens withthe court case, we believe that Bio-Technology's present markets forBio-Tropin as well as revenues from other products will promulgate adequateearnings growth in 1996 without U.S. sales.Oxandrin addresses an underserved and growing market   The problems related to Bio-Tropin has muddied the waters in relation tothe company's other promising products. In the unfolding of Genentech'sinjunction, investors have forgotten about Oxandrin, BTG's approved drugfor weight gain. Oxandrin is an anabolic steroid used in patients sufferingfrom severe weight loss (``wasting syndrome'') due to chronic infection,extensive surgery, or trauma. Wasting syndrome, clinically known ascachexia, is a metabolic disruption frequently occurring in patients with acompromised immune system. Cachexia causes the body to break down proteinstores to meet energy requirements rather than first using stores of fat.The combination of losing body weight and muscle mass in a seriously illpatient leads to a life threatening condition.   Oxandrin has distinct advantages over the current crop of therapies usedin wasting syndrome. Megace, an injectable anabolic steroid, has a higherliver toxicity profile and also may lead to androgenic effects in femalepatients. Megace has also demonstrated limited efficacy in weight gainthrough adding lean muscle mass. Weight gain with Megace adds mostly waterand fat. Human growth hormone, while effective in adding weight, isprohibitively expensive at over $50,000 per treatment year. Reimbursementfor hGH in this indication is not expected by many insurance companies norfrom state Medicaid or AIDS Drug Assistance programs. Oxandrin on the otherhand, can be taken orally, halts weight loss, adds lean muscle mass, andcosts about $20 per daily dosage (roughly $6,000 per treatment year).   Oxandrin, as discussed, is already approved for a variety ofindications. Additionally, BTG is trying to expand the labeling of Oxandrinthrough Treatment Investigative New Drug trials. Treatment IND statusallows the company to be reimbursed during the trial. A Phase IIITreatment IND trial in AIDS cachetic patients is going forward in 1996 anda Treatment IND trial for Turners Syndrome has already been completed. TheTreatment IND could ideally generate a revenue stream of $8 millionalthough our forecasts are more conservative at $5 million in 1996. Approximately 75,000 AIDS patients in the United States are cachetic.   Severe weight loss is not just a symptom of AIDS patients. Cancer andaging are two vast markets in which Oxandrin can easily be adopted. BTG hasa dialogue with medical specialists treating wasting conditions andoncologists concerning Oxandrin's use. Cachetic cancer patients numberbetween 250,000 to 400,000 in the United States alone. We believe thecurrent labeling of Oxandrin will allow it to be given to cachetic cancerpatients.   In November 1995, Bio-Technology General announced an alliance withQuantum Health Resources to distribute Oxandrin nationally. Quantum'stherapies and services are provided through four regional centers, 20licensed branches, and 17 service branches throughout the United States. Quantum's expertise is in long-term chronic disorders and specializeddisease management where the needs of patients differ markedly from acuteor short-term illnesses. Due to Quantum's recent problems with its mainstayhemophilia service unit, we believe Quantum will place a strong emphasison growing Oxandrin business.BioLon's smaller revenue contributions round out BTG's drug portfolio   BioLon is a sodium hyaluronate product used in cataract surgery andintraocular lens transplantation. It is a high-viscosity, gel-like fluidwhich also has applications in dry eye syndrome and as a general contactlens solution. Marketing partners sell BioLon in Canada, Spain, SouthKorea, India, Mexico, and Israel. Labaoratoire Chauvin is launching BioLonin Europe during 1996 and a New Drug Application is planned to be filed inthe U.S. Upjohn-Pharmacia sells hyaluronic acid in the United States underthe trade name Healon. Healon goes off patent in February 1996. Revenuegrowth from BioLon will come principally from the U.S. and to a lesserextent, Europe. Although competition will no doubt be fierce, revenuecontributions from BioLon will approximate $4 million in 1996 and about $6million in 1997.Androtest-SL represents the company's most promising pipeline drug   This pipeline drug is a sublingual form of testosterone that is absorbedin the bloodstream through the mucosal membrane under the tongue.Androtest-SL is designed to treat hypogonadism, a testosterone deficiencythat affects about 250,000 males in the United States alone. Androtest-SLis also being developed to treat delay of growth and puberty which affectsabout 80,000 boys (U.S. market). Hypogonadal males, either through aconstitutional deficiency or through aging, suffer lower testosteronelevels which leads to impotence, suppressed libido, and loss of musclemass.   Current therapies include testosterone injections, scrotal patches, andtransdermal patches attached to the upper thighs and stomach area. Whilethe intramuscular injections are being abandoned in favor of the newtransdermal patches (such as those marketed by Theratech and Alza), webelieve that Androtest-SL will provide an even more convenient alternativefor hypogonadal males. The obvious disadvantage that transdermal patcheshave compared to injections is delivery. However, the patch must be wornconstantly which may lead to irritation and discomfort. As an oral tablettaken three times a day, Androtest-SL provides a convenient alternative topatches and painful injection.   The drug has proved effective in Phase III trials and is being preparedfor registration with the FDA. An NDA filing is expected at the latest bymid-1996 with sales commencing as early as mid-1997. Androtest-SL hasOrphan Drug status for constitutional delay of growth and puberty. Like theOxandrin market, the hypogonadal market is a segment that hasn't beenproperly addressed in the past. Competing transdermal patch companies likeAlza and Theratech are attempting to expand this market for men withimpotency, mild testosterone deficiency, and males that experience lowertestosterone levels because of aging. Under this criteria, the expandedmarket numbers between 3 million and 5 million males in the United States.But even without such indications, Androtest-SL's ease of use andcompetitive profile may help it capture as much as $12 million in revenueswhen marketing commences in 1997.   BioTropin, Oxandrin, BioLon, and Androtest-SL constitute the productswhich will generate earnings growth in the next five years. Other productscurrently being sold include psoriasis treatment, Silkis, sold in Europethrough marketing partner Cilag S.A. and Delatestryl, an injectibletestosterone product being phased out in favor of Androtest-SL. Aside fromAndrotest-SL, drugs in development include Porcine Growth Hormone for theproduction of leaner pork products; OxSODrol (Phase II/III trials) for theprevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns; and Bio-Hep-B, athird generation vaccine against the hepatitis B virus.Financial summary and valuation   We're expecting Bio-Technology General to post break-even numbers whenit reports its fourth quarter and year-end results sometime in February1996. Third quarter 1995 net income was $0.00 per share, which excluded anextraordinary gain of $0.03 due to debt forgiveness. Bio-Technology Generalreached a major turning point in 1995 as its revenues (including interestincome) matched its expenses and the company demonstrated the ability to goforward in 1996 as a profitable company.   The company will probably have a burn-rate of approximately $5 millionfor 1995 and end the year with about $12 million cash and equivalents. Withonly half a million in long-term liabilities and nearly $15 million inworking capital, the company has a credible balance sheet. We arepredicting earnings of $0.15 in 1996 and $0.45 in 1997 broken out in Table1.   In 1996, the company will be cash flow positive and will probably notneed to raise substantial capital in the form of a secondary offering ordebt. Also, resources for marketing and sales infrastructure are alreadyin place along with several international marketing partnerships. BTG hasbypassed the dilemma that many biotechs meet when products are approvedwithout a sales force to market them. However, should the opportunitypresent itself and market conditions prove favorable, we would view asecondary offering as a positive development since BTG would be issuingshares from a position of financial strength.   Both administrative and R&D expenses have been pared down in recentyears as management has made a commitment to keep operating costswell-controlled. Expenses in both categories will increase modestly in1996 and 1997. The company also has over $50 million in net operating losscarryforwards which expire from 1996 through 2009, therefore no provisionsfor income tax has been made in our earnings model.   We think that Bio-Technology General is an overlooked biopharmaceuticalwith excellent growth potential and a robust pipeline unusual for asmall-cap concern. Its products meet the needs of immature, underservedmarkets and possesses a fundamental investment profile in a sectornotorious for pie-in-the-sky prospects. Our one year price target is $12.00based on a price/earnings ratio of 27X 1997 earnings. The ratio reflectsan average of generic drug companies' and pharmaceutical p/e ratios. Weare using a we strongly recommend purchase of the shares.BIO-TECHNOLOGY GENERAL52 week range                   6.37 - 21994 EPS                        d$0.231995 estimated EPS              $0.001996 estimated EPS              $0.151997 estimated EPS              $0.45Indicated quarterly dividend    NilP/E on 1994 EPS                 NMP/E on estimated 1995 EPS       NMP/E on estimated 1996 EPS       39P/E on estimated 1997 EPS       13Shares outstanding              43.3 millionShare float                     32.6 millionInstitutional holdings          17%S&P 500                         609.45Fiscal year ends December 31.SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA                                  Year ended December 31                                      1994        1993Revenues  ($000s)                   16,937      13,296Net income  (loss) ($000s)          (7,419)    (22,825)Earnings (loss) per share ($)        (0.19)      (0.63)                                  Year ended December 31                                      1992        1991Revenues  ($000s)                    6,791       5,388Net income  (loss) ($000s)         (10,535)     (8,065)Earnings (loss) per share ($)        (0.32)      (0.31)Table 1.

Last year, 489 IPOs were added to S&P's New Issues Index, comparedwith 496 the year before, while total dollars raised came to $31.1 billion,compared with $34.0 billion in 1994. Both years significantly trailed therecord 672 deals and $56.9 billion raised in 1993. Despite the fireworkssurrounding many technology deals, they are typically smaller than thosefor mature companies reentering the market via a reverse LBO or ADRs, REITsor closed end funds, which were popular offerings at various times over thelast 10 years. Despite some highly visible reverse LBOs and ADRs such asNabisco Holdings, Royal PTT Nederland, ENI, Canadian National Railways,AVX, Gucci Group and Estee Lauder, there were fewer reverse LBOs and ADRson the IPO roster last year.   With the economy slowing down, there were many industries that were offlimits to underwriters during the year. Financials and technology were in,but heavy industry, basic materials, consumer durables and consumernondurables were out. With overall market leadership narrow, underwritershad to concentrate their energies in the few in-favor industries.   Although the year ended with a bang, with $14.0 billion raised from 201deals during the last quarter, we believe that both the number and dollarsraised in 1996 will be slightly lower than last year's totals. Standard &Poor's is of the view that the total return of the S&P 500 will be lessthan double digits and that intermediate term fixed income investmentscould provide similar returns over the next 12 months. With the economyexhibiting sluggish growth and interest in technology temporarily on thewane, we think that underwriters will easily be able to beat the 61 dealsand $3.7 billion raised in the first quarter of 1995. That was when themarket was treading water while waiting for interest rates to level off.Comparisons, however, will get tougher as the year wears on. Should theeconomy show signs of picking up, a number of offerings could surface inspecialty retailing and consumer products and services.Telecommunications equipment and Internet plays were the big winners   The S&P New Issues Index almost doubled in value last year, its bestperformance since 1991, when it rose 106.1%. It finished 1995 up 96.5%. Theindex tracks the performance of new issues, including REITs and closed endfunds, for the first six months of trading. To be added to the index, IPOsmust be firm underwritings priced at or above $5, with an offeringcapitalization of at least $5 million. We exclude bank and S&L conversions,best efforts deals and unit deals that include warrants. The index is priceweighted.   Fully 62 deals more than doubled last year based on offering price andwhat they closed the year at. Another 77 rose more than 50%. Before youget the idea that buying IPOs is like shooting fish in a barrel, though, itshould be pointed out that 135 deals fell in value, while another 109 roseless than 20%. Put together, they amount to 50% of all deals brought lastyear.   The biggest winner was Premisys Communications, which sextupled in lessthan nine months. The company makes integrated multiple access servers andconcentrators that support prevailing centrex and digital switchtechnologies as well as emerging frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode(ATM) technologies. Its products allow the proliferation of frame relaybased ISDN services within a traditional broadband network structure. Rightnow it is delivering just about the only ATM concentrator around. Revenuesfor the September quarter rose 149%, while earnings quintupled to $0.25.AT&T is its major customer and accounts for a third of revenues. One dangeris that when AT&T splits up, the new entity that makes equipment may choosea different vendor, or more likely, other more traditional switchmanufacturers will catch up technologically and cause profit margins,currently quite high, to eventually come down. The shares are currentlytrading at 80X consensus projected fiscal 1996 EPS.   Three of the next four winners were Internet plays, Spyglass, NetscapeCommunications and UUNET Technologies. Spyglass more than quintupled, NSCPalmost quadrupled, and UNET more than tripled. These companies went publicso early in their corporate lives that one could only conjecture as to howfast they might grow. All three are trading at multiples quantum leapshigher than just about any other non-Internet related or biotech growthstock.   We are of the view that the Internet will be the dominant masscommunications medium in the 21st century. Nonetheless, once forward fiveyear sales and earnings growth rates for these companies become defined,their share prices will be adjusted downward. In the meantime, shares ofNetscape, the company with the best shot at becoming a dominant player inInternet services, is trading at over 20X projected 1997 revenues!   Just about all the other big winners were technology related. There werenine software companies among the 25 biggest winners, plus threetelecommunications related companies. The only exceptions were RentersChoice, Compdent, Sequana Therapeutics, Garden Ridge and Spin-Tech.   PDT makes light activated drugs to treat or diagnose a variety ofdiseases. The company has yet to generate revenues or a profit, but it isentering phase III trials for a drug to be used on hard tumors. DSPCommunications is developing chipsets for wireless personal communicationsapplications. To date, sales have come from chipsets for Japanese digitalmobile phones. Customers include Kenwood, Kyocera and Sanyo. Renters Choiceruns 325 rent-to-own stores. Nine month earnings more than doubled on a 60%increase in sales. Verity is a maker of tools for the dissemination oftexts over various electronic networks. Although the company is stillrunning losses, revenues are up substantially. Greatest interest is in itsTopoc search engine for the Internet.As usual, small deals done by third tier underwriters populate losers list   The largest deal that landed on our losers list was Asia PacificResources. It has a 60.7% interest in a major Indonesian producer of pulpand rayon and almost wholly owns another firm that operates the largestsingle line pulp mill in the world. Three paper mills are planned, two inChina and one in Indonesia. Unfortunately, the company has not earned muchmoney since going public in early April. With economies slowing in mostmajor markets, the company could be expanding capacity at just the wrongtime.   Electronics Communications provides cellular phone services andequipment. Sales dropped over the last nine months, with operations goingto a loss due to one-time advertising charges. AHI Healthcare Systemsintegrates individual physicians and small medical groups into localmanaged healthcare delivery networks. Although revenues more than doubledin the nine months to 9/30/95, a larger than expected loss was reported dueto high development costs. Losses are expected to continue for at least onemore quarter.   Other losers brought by large underwriters include HighwayMasterCommunications. It offers a wireless communications network for use bytruckers. Although revenues rose substantially of late, losses failed tonarrow. Number Nine Visual Technology initially received a very favorablereception by investors. This maker of graphics accelerator products forpersonal computers continues to show a very positive sales trend, but aloss was reported for the September quarter. Analysts expected earnings of$0.25 a share.   Many of the worst losers were brought out by small underwriters such asInvestors Associates, Hampshire Securities, John G. Kinnard, Needham & Co.,Paulson Investments, Lexington Securities, and J.W. Charles. Small soleunderwritings tend to do well initially, but then tail off rapidly as timegoes on. Most of these deals have generally weak underlying fundamentals,but are operating in industries that are currently in favor. Theunderwriter insures success at the IPO by developing more than enoughdemand to float the shares at the offering, and those that are retailoriented often drive the share price higher by convincing its clients tobuy additional shares in the aftermarket. Then the underwriter moves on tothe next deal. Lacking sponsorship and with a market capitalization toosmall to hit the radar screens of most buy side managers, the offeringsinevitably drift lower.   Salomon Brothers brought out three deals that found their way on thelosers list, as did Alex. Brown. Even the most successful underwriters,however, bring out companies that falter due to subsequent poorer thanexpected results. Some deals that initially moved higher before plummetingincluded Business Resource Group, Number Nine Visual Technology, HelloDirect, TGV Software and EqualNet Holdings.Goldman Sachs dominates list of biggest deals   Of the 10 largest deals, Goldman, Sachs kept the books on six of them.No one else had more than one in the top 10. Goldman's largest deal wasNabisco Holdings, which went public early in the year. It advanced 33.2% invalue by year end. Other large Goldman deals were Prudential Reinsurance,PMI Group, Intimate Brands, Canadian National Railway and Borders Group.Morgan Stanley's largest deal was Royal PTT Nederland, which edged up 2.4%in the last five weeks of the year, Smith Barney's was Union PacificResources, up 20.8% in less than three months, CS First Boston's was ENI,rising 4.2% in five weeks, and Merrill Lynch's was DST Systems, whichadvanced 35.7% in two months.   The best performer in the aftermarket among the 10 largest deals wasPrudential Reinsurance, which advanced 39.6% by year end. The runner-up wasDST Systems. Large deals with offering capitalizations of more than $100million that rose more than 30% are on page 11.As usual, technology and white shoe underwriters lead in IPO aftermarket     performance   Technology, regional and white shoe underwriters usually lead the packin bringing out the most successful offerings, and 1995 was no exception.Rauscher Pierce leads the list. Of its four deals, one, Renters Choice,tripled, while another, Belmont Homes, doubled. Other regional houses thatbrought out excellent deals were William Blair and Robinson-Humphrey.   The major specialty technology underwriters, as usual, brought out dealsthat did much better than average in subsequent trading. Alex. Brown,Montgomery, Hambrecht & Quist and Robertson, Stephens all served bothinvestors and corporate clients in pricing their deals well. As is also thenorm, second tier technology underwriters such as Needham & Co., Miller,Johnson, Kuehn, and Unterberg Harris, for the most part brought out weakerthan average deals when they took the lead. The exceptions this year wereCowen & Co. and Volpe, Welty.   Salomon Brothers has been struggling to remain a major underwriter ofequity issues. The poor performance of their deals in the aftermarket in1995 will not make their task any easier going forward. The multi-officeretail brokers typically bring out poorer performing deals. PaineWebber haslanded in the lower half of the list for many years and appears thereagain, as does Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Smith Barney and DonaldsonLufkin. There were no exceptions to the rule this year.   The most deals were brought by Goldman, Sachs, followed by Robertson,Stephens, Alex. Brown, and Morgan Stanley. Both Goldman, Sachs and MorganStanley have consistently brought out better than average deals. OfGoldman's 36 IPOs, only six finished the year under water. Just five ofMorgan Stanley's offerings finished under their IPO prices.Sector rotation likely in 1996   From an investment perspective, over the next six months or so, we wouldemphasize those groups that could generate strong corporate earnings growthregardless of how the overall economy does. They include health care,(particularly HMOs and subacute care companies), energy services (thedrillers), REITs, insurance, computer networking, telecommunicationsequipment, and farm related businesses.   We may also see more foreign stocks. Many emerging markets could turn inbetter performances than the U.S. in 1996. Our bets are on the CzechRepublic, Argentina, Chile and the Philippines. Following on the heels ofGucci, we would also expect an increased number of ADR offerings of familyowned consumer product companies based in Europe.   With technology stocks in a deep freeze, many IPOs in this sector willbe postponed until the climate improves. That may not be until later in theyear. In the meantime, it appears that value could beat growth in a marketenvironment in which the total return of the S&P 500 this year may notreach its long term average of 10.1%.   At least for the first quarter, we would emphasize low P/E plays. Of thetech companies that do venture forth in this environment, they are apt tobe better priced. Although they may not move much in the immediateaftermarket, they could do well when technology comes back into favor,possibly late this year.   Groups we would not commit additional funds to now would be personalcomputer related technology, cyclicals, nonprecious metals, and consumerfinance stocks.Information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable.However, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness is not guaranteed.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightS&P'S EMERGING & SPECIAL SITUATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996   Vol. 16, NCAPITAL GUARANTY   FSA Holdings completed its proposed acquisition of Capital Guaranty for$23 a share in cash and stock on December 20, 1995.Information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable.However, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness is not guaranteed.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightS&P'S EMERGING & SPECIAL SITUATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996   Vol. 16, NC-CUBE MICROSYSTEMS   A two-for-one split was paid to shareholders of C-Cube Microsystems onDecember 19, 1995.

Natale, CFAEditorThe tug of war between value and growth goes on   Last year, growth beat value. The growth half of the S&P 500 provided atotal return of 38.1%, as measured by S&P/BARRA, while the value half ofthe index generated 37.0%. But, for the five years ended 12/31/95, valuegenerated a 16.9% compound annual total return, against 16.1% for growth.In 1996, value could again have the edge. With P/Es well above thehistorical norm and economic growth slowing down, investors are seeking toreduce perceived investment risks by searching out less expensive stocks inindustries that have not already run up. Indeed, we would be looking toplace money in industries that run on their own operating cycles, that is,that are less affected by what is going on in the overall economy.   For example, oil service companies, especially the drillers, stand tobenefit from increased exploration expenditures by the major oil companiesthis year. That is because new technologies such as 3-D seismic andhorizontal drilling have reduced finding costs, making the redevelopment ofolder fields and of new small fields economical. In addition, after 10years of depression, the supply of oil rigs is finally coming into balancewith demand. Day rates rose substantially last year even though natural gasprices plummeted and oil prices went nowhere. Our favorites here are GlobalMarine and Nabors Industries.   Another group attractive to value and growth players alike is healthcare. New rules coming out of Washington, D.C. could adversely impacthospital and nursing home businesses, but the drive to reduce per capitacosts will push increased use of subacute rehabilitation services andMedicare and Medicaid patients into HMOs. We have three rehab companies onour buy list, Mariner Health Group, RehabCare Group, and TheraTx. All aretrading at or below the market multiple as measured by the S&P 500. HMOs onour buy list are Pacificare Health Systems and United American Healthcare.   Semiconductor companies now look like value plays in the sense that theynow sport low P/Es despite prospects for above average, albeit somewhatcyclical, earnings growth. Many on our buy lists have been beaten up oflate and offer considerable appeal for investors looking beyond theuncertainties surrounding the industry as excess inventories are workeddown. Industry growth this year will not match the 40% increase inworldwide shipments experienced in 1995; 26% will be more like it. Still,that should more than justify a recovery in P/E ratios. In addition toSGS-Thomson, which is recommended in this issue, we like Exar, which makeslower end application specific integrated circuits, Integrated Circuits,which manufactures mixed signal Ics, and Sierra Semiconductor, which issupplying chips to fast growing ATM and frame relay telecommunicationsswitch makers. All of these companies are trading at single digit multiplesagainst current forecasted 1996 EPS.   We also suggest taking another look at real estate plays. With Standard& Poor's predicting the total return for the S&P 500 to be less that 10% in1996, REITs could provide comparable or better returns with less risk.Except for retail properties, real estate values continue to climb,particularly for office properties. Our favorites in this area includeCatellus Development, an almost pure play on the California recovery, FirstUnion Real Estate Trust, which has one of the lowest dividend payouts as apercent of cash flow in the REIT industry, which bodes well for steadydividend increases over the next 18 months, and Property Capital Trust,which is liquidating, and we feel will provide a total return well into thedouble digits as it does so over the next three to five years.   Other industries that we would target for investment, either throughIPOs or otherwise, are domestic farming (i.e. Case and Tractor Supply,insurance, and telecommunications equipment (Stratacom, SierraSemiconductor).   Finally, some leading emerging foreign markets should also providebetter returns than the S&P 500 in 1996. We would play them via listedclosed end funds. Our favorites are Czech Republic Fund and FirstPhilippine Fund.   Despite the weak start to the year by small stocks, we continue tobelieve that they will beat the S&P 500 this year. Earnings growth forcompanies in the SmallCap 600 is projected to be much stronger than the S&P500 in 1996, while the P/E ratios of small stocks are only slightly higher.Although investors are very unlikely to garner the same returns achieved in1995, small stocks should provide excellent relative returns in 1996.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graph: S&P SMALLCAP 600 VS.

The Interpretation of Key CRAStandards Remains Subject to Substantial Examiner Discretion.By:Christina M. Gattuso*In May 1995, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office ofThrift Supervision, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the``Agencies'') issued final revised regulations under the CommunityReinvestment Act (``CRA'') (the ``Revised CRA Regulations'').1 In thepreamble to that rulemaking, the Agencies noted that they would worktogether to improve training for examiners, to increase interagency effortsto apply standards consistently and reliably, and to minimize unnecessarycompliance burdens. Consistent with those efforts, on November 13, 1995,the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (``FFIEC'')officially released new CRA examination procedures that were jointlyadopted by the Agencies for monitoring an institution's compliance with theRevised CRA Regulations (the ``Procedures'').There are four sets of examination procedures -- procedures for large,retail institutions; for small institutions; for wholesale and limitedpurpose institutions; and for institutions with an approved strategic plan.In accordance with the Revised CRA Regulations, examiners began using thesmall institution examination procedures on January 1, 1996. The otherthree sets of procedures do not become mandatory until July 1, 1997.However, examiners will use the Procedures in conducting examinations ofthose institutions that elect to be evaluated under the Revised CRARegulation prior to that date.2In some instances, the assessment criteria set forth in the Proceduresmirror the twelve assessment factors under the prior CRA regulations.3Examiners will still review and rate institutions on the geographicdistribution of their loans; their record of opening and closing offices;their participation in community development projects; their real estate,small farm, and small business loans; and their participation in governmentloan programs for housing, small farms, and small businesses. Under theProcedures, the examiners will continue to review, but the institution willnot be rated, on any practices by the institution that are intended todiscourage applications, any prohibited discriminatory or other illegalcredit practices,4 the institution's ability to meet community creditneeds, the institution's delineated community, and the institution'swillingness to explore other activities. Under the Revised CRA Regulationsand the Procedures, examiners will no longer look at, and an institutionwill not be rated on, its ascertainment of community credit needs,marketing, and board of director involvement in the CRA process.   The Procedures emphasize that examiners are expected to exercisejudgement and common sense to minimize the burden imposed on theexamination process and to perform only those steps necessary to arrive atan accurate assessment of the institution's CRA performance.5 Consistentwith the Revised CRA Regulations, the Procedures establish evaluationmethods based on a review of objective data that can also be used byinstitutions to measure their own performance under the CRA. An examiner'sassessment of an institution's CRA performance will be based on a number ofobjective factors, which include the number and amount of loans originated,the amount of qualified investments, and the types of services provided bythe institution.6 However, by necessity the Procedures allow for examinerdiscretion in the assessment process in order to account for thedifferences among institutions and the communities they serve. While theneed for flexibility in assessing an institution's performance isimportant, unless the examiners are provided with clear guidance andcomprehensive training, inconsistencies in CRA examinations are likely tocontinue. The Agencies believe that the training examiners have receivedand will continue to receive in the future will enable examiners to makemore informed judgements in the areas in which they have discretion andshould ensure consistency in the examination process.7EXAMINATION PROCEDURES FOR LARGE RETAIL INSTITUTIONSThe Revised CRA Regulations provide that a financial institution with totalassets of $250 million or more or, regardless of size, one that is owned bya holding company with total banking and thrift assets greater than $1billion, will be examined under the Lending, Investment, and Service Tests.The Procedures set forth the items that will be reviewed in assessing aninstitution's performance under those three tests.Examination ScopeThe Procedures set forth factors that will be reviewed and compiled by theexaminers at the pre-examination stage to determine the scope of theimpending CRA examination.8 To make this determination, the examiners willreview the institution's prior CRA evaluations, information provided bycommunity contacts, and the lending data and demographic data reported foreach assessment area.9 The examiners will also consider the number of otherinstitutions in the assessment area and the opportunities available in theassessment area for lending, investment and other services. Based on thisinformation, the examiners will determine the scope of their on-site andoff-site examinations.Performance ContextThe Procedures require the examiners to establish a ``performance context''for the examination by evaluating information about the institution, itscommunity and its competitors. In this regard, the examiners will reviewstandardized worksheets and other agency information to obtain relevantdemographic, economic, and loan data on each assessment area underreview.10 The examiners will also review agency-prepared community contactforms for groups within the institution's assessment area, and may contactlocal community, governmental, or economic development representatives toupdate such information.11 To determine the institution's ability andcapacity to serve its assessment area, the examiners will review CallReports or Thrift Financial Reports (``TFRs''), annual reports, supervisoryreports and prior CRA evaluations. The examiners will also consider anyinformation the institution provides on its local community and economy,its business strategy, and its lending capacity, and any information thatotherwise assists in the evaluation of the institution.12 However,examiners will not require the institution to create such information; norwill they ask for any information other than what the institution hasdeveloped as part of its normal business practice.   Finally, by reviewing the public evaluations and other financial data,the examiners will determine whether any similarly situated institutions13serve the same or similar assessment area and, if so, whether they wouldprovide relevant and accurate information for evaluating the institution'sCRA performance. The Procedures note that the examiners should considerwhether such information would help to identify lending opportunitiesavailable in the institution's assessment area that are compatible with theinstitution's business strategy and consistent with safe and sound bankingpractices; constraints affecting opportunities to make safe and sound loansand qualified investments compatible with the institution's businessstrategy in the assessment area; and successful CRA-related productofferings or activities used by other lenders serving the same or a similarassessment area.   The development of the performance context will likely occur prior toinitiation of the on-site examination. The Revised CRA Regulations and theProcedures make clear that an institution need not compile or maintaininformation related to the performance context. However, to the extent theinstitution compiles information to analyze the demand for loans,investment and services within its assessment area, it would be to theinstitution's advantage to provide such information to the examiner for usein developing the performance context.Assessment AreaUnder the prior CRA regulations, an institution's delineated community wasreviewed and rated as part of an institution's overall CRA performance. TheRevised CRA Regulations require an institution to define its assessmentarea but do not require that an examiner rate the institution's assessmentarea. The Procedures and the Revised CRA Regulations state that examinerswill use the institution's assessment area unless they determine that ``theassessment area does not comply with the requirements for assessment areasset forth in the final rule.''14 Since this is not a rated area, anincorrect identification or definition of an institution's assessment areawill not result in a downgrading of an institution's CRA Rating.15As long as an institution's assessment area meets the requirements of theRevised CRA Regulations, the examiners should not second guess theassessment area. In order to meet the requirements of the Revised CRARegulations, the assessment area should consist of one or more metropolitanstatistical areas (``MSAs'') or contiguous political subdivisions. Itshould also include the geographies16 where the institution has its mainoffice, its branches, and any deposit-taking ATMs, and the areassurrounding such locations where the institution originated or purchased asubstantial portion of its loans. In addition, the assessment area shouldconsist of whole geographies; it should not exclude low or moderate incomegeographies and should not illegally discriminate; and not extendsubstantially across consolidated MSAs or state boundaries unless theinstitution is in a multi-state MSA. If the examiners find that theassessment area fails to meet these regulatory criteria, the examiners willdevelop a revised assessment area and will evaluate the institution'sperformance based on that revised assessment area.Public File ChecklistThe Procedures provide that there is no need for the examiners to revieweach branch or each complete public file during every examination,particularly if the institution has complied with the public filerequirements of the Revised CRA Regulations in previous examinations.However, it is likely that the examiners will review the public files inthe first examination of every institution under the Revised CRARegulations and the Procedures. In cases where a review of the public fileis undertaken, the examiners will determine whether an accurate publicnotice is displayed in the lobby of each branch, and whether the file(s) inthe main office and in each state contain all information required by theRevised CRA Regulations.17Performance CriteriaLending TestThe Lending Test is the primary test for large, retail institutions, sincefailure to achieve at least a Low Satisfactory rating in this area makes itimpossible to achieve an overall Satisfactory rating. The examiners willrate the institution's lending performance under the following criteria:lending activity; geographic distribution; borrower characteristics;community development lending; and innovative or flexible lendingpractices. The analysis under the Lending Test is similar to the analysisconducted under the prior CRA regulations.   After the examiners determine the loans to review for purposes of theLending Test,18 the examiners will test a sample of loan files to verifythe accuracy of data collected and/or reported by the institution and toensure that (i) affiliate loans reported by the institution are not alsoattributable to another affiliate subject to CRA;19 (ii) loans reported ascommunity development loans meet the definition of community developmentloans;20 and (iii) all consumer loans in a particular loan category havebeen included, when the institution collects and maintains the data for oneor more loan categories and elects to have the information evaluated. Theexaminers will also identify the dollar amount and number of loans underevaluation that the institution has made or purchased within its assessmentarea, taking into account the institution's resources and business strategyand other information that the examiners gather under the performancecontext, including population, income, housing, and business data. Theexaminers will also review any analyses offered by the institution toprovide insight into the reasonableness of the institution's geographicdistribution of lending.21 If the areas of low- or no-loan penetration arefound in the institution's analyses, the examiners will review explanationsand determine whether the institution took action to address thedisparities.   While the Procedures direct the examiners to supplement their reviewwith an independent analysis of geographic distribution as necessary todetermine the extent to which the institution is serving geographies ineach income category, they make clear that an institution is not requiredto lend in every geography. The Procedures also permit the examiners tocompare the institution's lending performance to that of other lenderswithin its assessment area if the examiners determine that such an analysiswould provide insight into the reasons for an abnormally low penetration oflending in the assessment area. Taking all of these factors intoconsideration, the examiners will determine whether the institution'sabnormally low loan penetration in certain areas should constitute anegative consideration in rating the geographic distribution of theinstitution's loans.   In terms of borrower characteristics, the examiners will review anyanalyses prepared by or for the institution to determine the reasonablenessof the institution's loan distribution by borrower characteristics. To theextent necessary, the examiners will supplement the analysis provided bythe institution with an independent analysis. If the institution adequatelyserves borrowers within its assessment area, the examiners will look to itsperformance outside its assessment area based on borrower characteristicsto determine whether such performance would enhance the assessment of theinstitution's overall performance.   The examiners will also review the institution's community developmentlending, using information obtained in the performance context to determinethe responsiveness of the institution to available community developmentopportunities and the extent to which the institution has demonstratedleadership in community development lending.   Finally, the examiners will evaluate whether the institution usesinnovative or flexible loan products, and, if so, the degree to which theloans serve low- and moderate-income individuals in new ways or serveborrowers not previously served by the institution. In addition, theexaminers will look at the success of any innovative or flexible loanproducts offered by the institution, including the number and dollar amountof such loan products originated during the review period.22 To somedegree, an institution's rating under the Lending Test will be based onobjective data. However, examiners will still be required to determinewhether an institution's lending activity is reasonable or adequate, termsthat are not defined in the Revised CRA Regulations or the Procedures, inorder to reach a conclusion as to which rating to assign to theinstitution.Investment TestThe review of an institution's performance under the Investment Test issimilar to the examiners' review of this area under the prior CRARegulations. Under the Investment Test, the examiners will identifyqualified investments23 by reviewing the institution's investmentportfolio, and, if elected by the institution, the investment portfolio ofits affiliate(s). Investments that were made since the last CRA evaluationand those that were made prior to the previous CRA evaluation but stillremain outstanding will be considered. The examiners will also considerqualifying grants, donations, or in-kind contributions of property sincethe last evaluation that are for community development purposes.   In evaluating the institution's investment portfolio, the examiners willdetermine whether the investments benefit the institution's assessment areaor a broader area that includes the institution's assessment area; whetherthe investments have been considered under the Lending or Service Tests;whether an affiliate's investments have been claimed by anotherinstitution; the dollar volume of investments made to entities that are inor serve the assessment area, in relation to the institution's capacity andconstraints, and the assessment area's characteristics and needs; the useof any innovative or complex investments; and the degree to which theinvestments serve low- and moderate- income areas or individuals, and areresponsive to available opportunities for qualified investments.24   After considering the number and dollar amount of qualified investments;the innovativeness and complexity of qualified investments; the degree towhich these types of investments are routinely provided by other privateinvestors; and the responsiveness of the institution's qualifiedinvestments to available opportunities, the examiners will reach aconclusion regarding the institution's performance under the InvestmentTest. As with the Lending Test, there will be some degree of subjectivityin reaching this conclusion since examiners will need to determine theadequacy of an institution's qualified investments in order to assign arating.Service TestThe Service Test evaluates the institution on the basis of the retailbanking and community development services provided by the institution.With respect to retail banking service, the information used by theexaminers to evaluate the institution is similar to information reviewedunder the prior CRA regulations. As was the case under the prior CRAregulations, the institution should be prepared to provide an explanationfor any material differences in the hours of operations or servicesavailable at branches within the institution's assessment area.   The examiners will also review the institution's record of opening andclosing branches within its assessment area since the previous evaluationand the extent to which any such openings or closings have had a negativeor positive impact on low- and moderate-income geographies within theinstitution's assessment area. In addition, the institution will beevaluated on the basis of the accessibility and use of alternative systemsof delivering banking services in low and moderate income geographies andto low and moderate income individuals.25 Finally, the examiners willassess the quantity, quality, and accessibility of the institution'sservice-delivery systems provided for all income areas within itsassessment area. In making such an assessment, the examiners are directedto consider the degree to which services are tailored to the convenienceand needs of each geography.   As part of the Service Test, the examiners will also review theinstitution's community development services, which can include at theinstitution's option, services through affiliates of the institution. Theexaminers will identify such services and determine whether the servicesqualify under the definition of community development services, benefit theassessment area or a broader statewide or regional area encompassing theinstitution's assessment area; and ensure that any services provided byaffiliates of the institution are not claimed by other affiliatedinstitutions. Taking into account the information gathered in theperformance context, the examiners will evaluate the extent of thecommunity development services offered by the institution; theinnovativeness of any such services, including whether they serve low- andmoderate- income customers in new ways or serve groups of customers notpreviously served; and the degree to which they serve low- or moderate-income areas or individuals and their responsiveness to availableopportunities for community development services.RatingsBased on the analysis discussed above, an institution will be ratedOutstanding, High Satisfactory, Low Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, orSubstantial Noncompliance for each of the Lending, Investment, and ServiceTests.26 These rating descriptions are relatively subjective in order toprovide the examiners with the flexibility to accommodate differences ininstitutions and their communities. The Procedures do not provide anyguidance on interpretation of the descriptions. The examiners will totalthe institution's scores on the three tests to assign the institution anoverall composite rating. Under the Procedures, an institution's assignedrating can be no more than three times its score on the Lending Test.27 Inaddition, the examiners must take into account the results of the fairlending component of the institution's most recent compliance examinationand determine whether these findings should lower the institution's overallCRA Rating. In determining whether to downgrade the institution, theexaminer will also take into account the nature and extent of any evidenceof discrimination, the policies the institution has in place to preventdiscriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective actiontaken, and any other relevant information.EXAMINATION PROCEDURES FOR SMALL INSTITUTIONSGenerallyUnder the new Procedures, the scope of the examination for smallinstitutions is streamlined, with the primary focus on the institution'slending performance. If a small institution has more than one assessmentarea, the examiners will select the assessment areas for on-site reviewbased on the institution's prior CRA performance, its lending activity inthe assessment area, information obtained from community contacts, anddemographic data on each assessment area.   The performance context for small institutions generally includes thesame information that is reviewed in the performance context forexaminations of large, retail institutions. The primary difference is thatthe examination is much more streamlined, and while the examiners willreview financial information and the prior CRA evaluations of institutionsof similar size that serve the same or similar assessment area(s), theywill not consider the same detail of information regarding similarlysituated institutions as will be considered in examining large retailinstitutions. The review of the assessment area of a small institution isthe same as that of a large, retail institution, as is the review of thesmall institution's public files.   The examiners will review small institutions in five areas: (i) theloan-to-deposit analysis; (ii) comparison of credit extended inside andoutside of the assessment area; (iii) distribution of credit within theassessment area; (iv) review of complaints; and (v) investments andservices (at the institution's option to enhance a satisfactory rating.)Performance CriteriaLoan-to-Deposit AnalysisExaminers will use the data contained in Call Reports and TFRs to calculatethe institution's average loan-to-deposit (``LTD'') ratio since theinstitution's last examination by adding the quarterly loan-to-depositratios and dividing by the number of quarters covered by the examination.If the LTD ratio is high, the examiners will only analyze financialinformation. If the ratio is low, the examiners will make a determinationabout the reasonableness of the LTD ratio by reviewing information gatheredin the performance context, including the institution's capacity to lend,the capacity of other similarly situated institutions to lend in theassessment area, demographic and economic factors present in the assessmentarea, and the lending opportunities available in the institution'sassessment area.28 If the examiners determine that the LTD is notreasonable in light of the performance context, they will also consider thenumber and dollar volume of any loans sold by the institution to thesecondary market, the innovativeness or complexity of community developmentloans and qualified investments by the institution, to assess the extent towhich those activities compensate for a low LTD ratio or supplement theinstitution's lending performance as reflected in its LTD ratio.   Comparison of Credit Extended Inside and Outside of the AssessmentArea(s)The examiners will review HMDA data, automated loan reports or otherreports generated by the institution to analyze the extent of lending bythe institution both inside and outside the assessment area. If such datais not available or cannot be verified, the examiners will use samplingguidelines to select a sample of loans originated, purchased, committed tocalculate the percentage of loans located within the assessment area. Onlyif the percentage of loans or other activities inside the assessment areaconstitute majority of the institution's lending and other activities willthe institution meet the standards for a Satisfactory rating under thiscategory. If such activities are less than a majority, the examiners willconsider information from the performance context with respect to economicconditions, loan demand, and the institution's size, financial condition,branching network, and business strategies.29 If an institution has asignificant amount of lending outside of its assessment area, it may wantto provide the examiners with a geocoded lending analysis since samplingmay not accurately reflect the institution's lending activity.Distribution of Credit within the Assessment AreaThe Procedures direct the examiners to determine first whether the numberand income distribution of geographies in the assessment area aresufficient for a meaningful analysis of the geographic distribution of theinstitution's loans in its assessment area. If such an analysis would bemeaningful and the necessary geographic information is collected by theinstitution in the ordinary course of business, the examiners willdetermine the distribution of the institution's loans in its assessmentarea within the four geographies. While the Procedures state that theabsence of loans in any particular geography should not be a concern, theexaminers are directed to identify groups of geographies by incomecategories in which there is little or no loan penetration.30 If theinstitution collects information about borrower income or revenue, theexaminers will review such information to determine the distribution of theinstitution's loans in the assessment area by borrower income and businessrevenue, and to identify categories of borrowers for which there is littleto no penetration of loans.   If an analysis of the distribution of loans would not be meaningful orcould not be performed, the examiners may analyze the geographicdistribution by street address rather than geography (if such data isavailable and the analysis would be reasonable), or they may analyze thedistribution by loan size as a proxy for income or revenue of the borrower.If the analysis shows that the institution is not penetrating some areas orhas low penetration in some areas, the examiners are directed to form aconclusion about the reasons for the loan penetration using informationgathered in the performance context. If the institution is found to havelow penetration of some areas, it may be useful for the institution toprovide the examiners with data to justify its loan distribution.Review of ComplaintsThe examiners will review all complaints received by the institutionregarding the institution's CRA performance and the institution's actionwith respect thereto as well as any complaints regarding the institutionreceived by the Agencies.Investments and ServicesThese areas will only be reviewed by the examiners at the institution'soption to enhance a Satisfactory rating. If the institution chooses to havethese areas reviewed, the examiners will consider the dollar amount ofqualified investments, the impact of those investments on the institution'sassessment area, and the innovativeness or complexity of the investments.31With respect to services provided by the institution, the examiners willtake into account the same general information considered under the ServiceTest for large retail institutions.RatingsA small institution will be assigned a Satisfactory rating if it meets eachof the standards set forth in the Revised CRA Regulations for that ratingor if it has exceptionally strong performance with respect to some of thestandards that compensates for weak performance in other standards.32 If aninstitution fails to qualify for a Satisfactory rating, the examiners willassign a Needs to Improve or a Substantial Noncompliance Rating dependingon the degree to which the institution's performance falls short of aSatisfactory rating. The Procedures also direct the examiners to review theresults of the fair lending component of the institution's most recentcompliance examination to determine whether those findings should lower theinstitution's overall CRA Rating.PROCEDURES FOR LIMITED PURPOSE AND WHOLESALE INSTITUTIONSGenerallyUnder the Revised CRA Regulations, limited purpose and wholesaleinstitutions are evaluated under separate examination procedures on thebasis of the community development test.33 The scope of the examination forlimited purpose and wholesale institutions will focus on communitydevelopment lending, qualified investments, and community developmentservices. In defining the performance context for the examination, theexaminers will review the same types of information reviewed under theperformance context for large, retail institutions except that the analysiswill focus on the information as it relates to community development. Thus,to the extent the institution collects data to analyze the types ofcommunity development opportunities in its assessment area, it shouldconsider providing such information to the examiners for their use inestablishing the performance context. The evaluation of the assessment areais generally the same as for large, retail institutions.Performance CriteriaUnder the Community Development Test, the examiners will review theinstitution's performance with regard to community development lending,qualified investments, and community development services. The examinerswill review the number and dollar amount of community development loansmade by the institution and will test a sample of the institution'scommunity development loan files to verify that such loans qualify ascommunity development loans. The examiners also will review qualifiedinvestments and other community development services provided by theinstitution and, at the institution's option, will include activities byaffiliates and community development lending by consortia or third parties.In reaching a conclusion about the institution's community developmentperformance, the examiners will take into account the degree of innovationin community development lending activities and the responsiveness of theinstitution to the opportunities for community development activities.34 Tothe extent the institution is collecting information regarding communitydevelopment loans and qualified investments, the institution should providethe examiners with such information, as well as information on thebeneficiaries of such loans and investments.RatingsThe institution will be rated based on the examiner's analysis of theinstitution's performance under the Community Development Test inaccordance with the criteria set forth in the Revised CRA Regulations.35While the rating descriptions set forth in the Revised CRA Regulation arehighly subjective, the Procedures are fairly straightforward.PROCEDURES FOR INSTITUTIONS WITH STRATEGIC PLANSGenerallyThe examination scope for institutions with strategic plans will focus onwhether or not the institution has met the goals stated within itsstrategic plan.36 In order to make such a determination, the examiners mayalso consider the level of the institution's lending, investment andservice activity in the different assessment areas, particularly in low-and moderate- income areas, the importance of the institution in meetingthe credit needs in its assessment area, information provided by communitycontacts and the institution's prior performance evaluations.37As part of the performance context, the examiners will consider anyinformation that the institution provides on its record of meeting thegoals of the strategic plan and will contact local community, governmentaland other representatives to update or supplement information about theinstitution's record of meeting the plan goals. Since the institution islikely to be gathering data to show its progress toward meeting its goalsunder the plan, the institution should consider providing that informationto the examiners. The review of the institution's assessment area willoccur when the strategic plan is submitted.Performance CriteriaThe examiners will review the institution's performance to evaluate theinstitution's record of meeting the performance goals set forth in itsplan. If the goals were not met, the examiners will determine whether theplan goals were ``substantially met'' by considering the number of unmetgoals, the degree to which the goals were not met, the importance of thosegoals and the reasons why the goals were not met.RatingsA rating will be assigned to the institution based on the goals and ratingobjectives established by the plan. If the institution has not``substantially met'' its goals, it can elect to be evaluated under thesmall institution, large or retail institution, or wholesale or limitedpurpose institution test, as appropriate.38 The examiners will also reviewan institution's fair lending performance based on its most recentcompliance examination to determine whether evidence of discriminationexists that should lower the institution's overall CRA Rating.CONCLUSIONThe Procedures are designed to reduce the burden associated with the CRAexamination process while at the same time ensure consistency in theexamination process. While the Revised CRA Regulations and the Proceduresshift the focus of the examination process from documentation to communityreinvestment results, examiners will continue to exercise a fair amount ofdiscretion in interpreting the CRA standards. For example, under theProcedures, examiners will still be required to make subjectivedeterminations with regard to the ``innovativeness'' of loans andinvestments and they will be required to differentiate between ``adequate''responsiveness and ``poor'' responsiveness or ``excellent'' and``reasonable'' dispersion of loans. In the past, the attempts by thefederal banking regulators to ensure certainty and consistency in theexamination process by revising their examination guidance and trainingprograms did not achieve the intended results. The success of the mostrecent attempt by the regulators will be determined over time asexaminations are conducted pursuant to the Procedures. In the meantime,institutions would be well advised to continue to maintain data to supporttheir CRA performance.About the Author(s):*CHRISTINA M.

Even though the Revised CRA Regulations are not effective for otherthan small institutions until July 1, 1997, according to an official of theOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC''), between now and thatdate, examiners will focus on five of the twelve assessment factors setforth in the prior CRA Regulations -- geographic distribution of loans,number of home mortgage and small business loans, participation ingovernment loans programs, participation in community developmentactivities and the bank's record of opening and closing branches.

An institution's fair lending program is no longer rated under theRevised CRA Regulations. However, the Procedures provide that an examinermay decrease an institution's CRA Rating if instances of illegaldiscrimination are discovered in the institution's credit practices. See,e.g., Large Institution Examination Procedures at 145. The Procedures eliminate 50 steps, some of them multi-part, from theold examination procedures under the prior CRA regulations. See Letter fromthe Agencies to The Honorable Joseph P. Kennedy II, dated Jan. 3, 1996.6. See 12 C.F.R. Section25.22 (b). For small institutions, the examinerswill look at objective factors such as an institution's loan to depositratio; the percentage of loans located in the institution's assessmentarea; and the geographic distribution of the institution's loans. See 12C.F.R. Section25.26(a).7. The Agencies are in the process of drafting an ``Official StaffCommentary'' to the Revised CRA Regulations which will be published fornotice and comment in the Federal Register and which is intended to providethe public and examiners with a consistent interpretation of the RevisedCRA Regulations.8. The Revised CRA Regulations require large institutions to collect andreport certain data that will be used by the examiners to evaluate CRAperformance. See 12 C.F.R. Section25.42. The data will be reported to theAgencies electronically in standardized format which will enable theexaminers to conduct much of the necessary analysis prior to the on-siteexamination.9. The Revised CRA Regulations and the Procedures address the means bywhich an institution's performance will be reviewed if it has multipleassessment areas. For purposes of this article, an institution's assessmentarea is referred to in the singular.10. The Agencies have devised standardized worksheets for use by theexaminers in determining community profile, economic patterns, and lendingdistribution.11. The examiners will conduct interviews with local community, civic, orgovernment leaders to help learn about the community, its economic base,and local community development initiatives. These interviews may beconducted prior to the examination or as part of the examination.12. While an institution is not required to provide such information tothe examiners or to create such information, it may still be advisable tomaintain the data necessary to respond to any issues that may be raised inthe examination. To the extent an institution maintains such information,it should provide it to the examiners to assist them in establishing theperformance context for the examination.13. The examiners will look to institutions that are similarly situated interms of size, financial condition, product offerings, and businessstrategy.14. 60 Fed. Reg. at 22171.15. However, if the assessment area reflects illegal discrimination,examiners will take into account problems with the designation of theassessment area when assigning a rating to the institution.

Generally, these items include, but are notlimited to, all written comments from the public relating to theinstitution's CRA performance; the institution's most recent CRA PublicPerformance Evaluation; a map of the assessment area; a list of servicesprovided by the institution; and, if applicable, the number and amount ofconsumer loans make to the four income categories of borrowers andgeographies and the number and amount located inside and outside theassessment area.18. This will be accomplished by reviewing the institution's most recentHMDA and CRA Disclosure Statement, interim HMDA Loan Application Register(``LAR''), and any interim CRA data collected by the institution; a sampleof consumer loans if consumer lending represents a substantial majority ofthe institution's business and any other information the institutionchooses to provide regarding its lending activities. The institution mayalso provide information on small business loans secured by non-farmresidential real estate, home equity loans not reported for HMDA, unfundedcommitments, and information on loans outstanding and loan distributionanalysis conducted by and for the institution, including any explanationsfor identified concerns or actions taken to address such concerns. LargeInstitution Examination Procedures at 419. Examiners will accomplish this by requesting the institution toidentify how loans are attributed and how it ensures that all loans withina given lending category (e.g., small business loans, home equity loans,and other types of loans ) in a particular assessment area are reported forall of the institution's affiliates if the institution elects to count anyaffiliate loans.

A Company That Meaningfully Investigates Alleged Misconduct,Ensures That It Will Not Be Repeated, and Appropriately Sanctions theWrongdoer Will Be Judged More Leniently than the Errant Employee.By:John K. Carroll*Traditionally, the government has exercised its discretion over whether topunish a public company for the misconduct of its officers or employeesbased upon several factors: the seniority of the officer or employeeinvolved; the degree to which the company benefited from the misconduct,the vulnerability of the victims; the extent of harm inflicted; and, to alesser degree, the foreseeability of the misconduct. The consequence ofbasing prosecutorial discretion on this mix of factors has been to leavecompanies -- and their innocent shareholders -- at the mercy of errantemployees. By the time a company learns of the misconduct, it may alreadybe too late to avoid governmental punishment.In recent actions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'') hasindicated strongly that a new factor should be added to this mix. The SEChas made clear that it will calibrate corporate punishment based on thesteps taken by a company, through its board and senior management, onlearning of alleged employee misconduct. In so doing, the SEC hasdelineated a ``duty to respond,'' i.e., the responsibility of seniormanagement to investigate, deter, and punish employee and managementmisconduct. This duty to respond imposes new obligations on companiesconfronted with employee misconduct. In a realistic sense, it promises thata company's punishment, if any, will depend on the knowing and intentionalconduct of its managers.   In two reports, one issued at the end of last year, the SEC specificallyaddressed the duty to respond to employee misconduct.1 A public companywhose management meets this duty can argue compellingly that it should bejudged separately from its errant employees and should be treatedleniently.2 Managers who fail to respond will be criticized and sanctioned.Indeed, a lackadaisical management response may amplify a company'sexposure and even jeopardize its viability. This article will review theCooper and Gutfreund reports and examine the three steps required tofulfill the duty to respond articulated in those reports.THE COOPER COMPANIESBackgroundIn November 1992, a grand jury in the Southern District of New Yorkreturned a 24-count indictment against the Cooper Companies, Inc. and GarySinger, Cooper's chief executive officer.3 In substance, the indictmentcharged Singer in two fraudulent schemes relating to his position as CEO ofCooper. The first scheme, which involved front-running, benefited bothSinger and Cooper. As set forth in the indictment, Singer was tipped by themanager of a high-yield mutual fund with information regarding thesecurities the manager intended to purchase for the portfolio. Singerprofited by going into the market ahead of the fund, purchasing bonds foraccounts he controlled, including Cooper accounts, and reselling the bondsto the fund at a profit. In return, Singer caused payments to be made byCooper to the manager.   Singer's second scheme directly victimized Cooper. Singer caused Cooperto sell high-yield bonds at below-market prices from Cooper's position toSinger and his family. Singer and his family then resold these bonds in themarket at a profit. Singer failed to disclose these related-partytransactions on internal Cooper questionnaires circulated among thecompany's management.   Cooper Company itself was indicted as a participant in Singer's firstscheme, even though the company was the direct victim of Singer's secondscheme and its shareholders were the direct or indirect victims of all ofSinger's misconduct. Simultaneous with the filing of the indictment, theSEC filed a civil action against Cooper, Singer, and his brother StevenSinger arising out of the same series of transactions.4   On January 13, 1994, following a jury trial, Singer was found guilty inconnection with each of the schemes.5 The company was also convicted inconnection with the front-running scheme. Eleven months later, on December12, 1994, the SEC settled its civil charges against Cooper. As a part ofthat settlement, the company agreed to be permanently enjoined from furtherviolations of specified sections of the securities laws, and from anyfurther employment of Gary or Steven Singer. In addition, Cooper wasordered to disgorge $1.4 million plus interest, and to pay a civil penaltyof $1.15 million. The settlement permitted Cooper to offset these paymentsagainst fines and restitution and interest payments made in connection withthe criminal conviction.6The Board's Failure to RespondThe charges against Cooper in both the indictment and the SEC complaintrepresent starkly the inherent paradox when a fraud charge is broughtagainst not only an employee but a public company itself. Why shouldinnocent shareholders suffer the financial consequences of their company'sindictment for the misconduct of an employee, albeit the chief executiveofficer? This issue is especially germane to the Cooper case because thecompany and its shareholders were the direct and intended victims of muchof Singer's misconduct. In its recent report, the SEC answered thatquestion by sharply criticizing Cooper's board for failing to respond toits knowledge of Singer's misconduct. The board's failure is worthdiscussing at length.   As discussed in the report, Cooper's directors were first notified ofalleged misconduct by Singer in January 1992, when the SEC issued a FormalOrder of Investigation of the Cooper Company.7 The board responded to theSEC notice by disclosing the pendency of the investigation in the company'sform 10-K filed at the end of January. There is no indication that theboard took any other action in response to the subpoena.   In early February 1992, the gap between the interests of the company andthose of the Singers widened. In response to SEC questioning, both Singersasserted their Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to testify. At thetime he invoked his privilege, Gary Singer was Cooper's CEO and StevenSinger was acting chief operating officer. Gary Singer had the authority totrade in the company's securities accounts. Steven Singer was formallyelected COO just days following his refusal to testify.   In March, after being formally advised that the company was beinginvestigated by the U.S. Attorney's office, the board authorized aninternal investigation by independent counsel. The board was subsequentlyinformed that independent counsel was unable to interview either Singerbrother. The investigation did reveal, however, that Gary Singer haddiverted $600,000 in trading profits from the company to personal andfamily accounts.8   The government investigation continued, and in May charges were filedagainst the two men who participated in the front-running scheme with Garyand Steven Singer. In connection with his guilty plea, one of these menidentified Gary Singer as a co-conspirator. Although the board was aware ofthese developments, it took no action in response. Subsequently, StevenSinger caused the company to issue a press release in which the companydenied knowledge of any wrongdoing on the part of management. Although thiswas clearly false, the board took no action.   Until the end of May when he agreed to take a leave of absence, GarySinger continued in his capacity as CEO. Even after his departure, theboard approved the continuation of his pay and benefits and authorized therelocation of his offices. The company issued a press release about hisleave of absence that included a denial by Singer that he had participatedin any illegal activity. This press release was also the first publicdisclosure of Gary and Steven Singer's refusal to testify before the SEC orto cooperate in the Company's internal investigation.   During the late summer and fall of 1992, Gary and Steven Singercontinued to participate in the business of the company. Gary Singerattended board meetings, was present at the company's headquarters, andcontinued to have contact with the company's securities brokers. StevenSinger was re-elected as COO in late July. It was not until November 1992that the board finally determined that additional supervision of StevenSinger was needed in light of his assertion of the Fifth Amendment in hisJanuary testimony.   The 21(a) ReportThe SEC unsparingly criticized the board's failure to respond to theallegations of the Singers' misconduct. As the Commission reported,Cooper's board had an affirmative obligation to act; by not acting, itfailed to meet its duties. The Commission explained that it is[e]ssential for board members to move aggressively to fulfill theirresponsibilities to oversee the conduct and performance of management andto ensure that the company's public statements are candid and complete.   In this case, Cooper's Board failed to satisfy its obligations whenconfronted with serious indications of management fraud. After the Boardlearned that a member of senior management had concealed fraudulentself-dealing transactions and thereby caused the company's outstandingreports to be inaccurate, the Board failed to take immediate and effectiveaction to protect the interests of the company's investors. The Board'sinaction allowed a second corporate officer, who himself was allegedlyinvolved in the fraudulent front-running scheme, to direct the issuance ofa press release on behalf of the company falsely denying any knowledge ofwrongdoing. By failing to take immediate and decisive corrective action onthese matters, the Cooper Board appeared to prefer management's interest inkeeping the facts secret over the investors' interest in full, fair, andaccurate disclosure under the federal securities laws.9   The consequence of the board's inaction was dramatic. By aligningCooper's interests with the Singers' fate, the board nullified its chancesof receiving lenient treatment from the government. Indeed, the indictmentof Cooper, in spite of its status as victim in one of Gary Singer'sschemes, can be traced directly to the board's failure to respondappropriately to the allegations of employee misconduct.GUTFREUNDThe Failure to RespondThe facts relating to misconduct on the government trading desk at SalomonBrothers in 1991 have been rehearsed thoroughly.10 The details ofmanagement's failure to respond to that misconduct are particularlyinstructive when considered along with the Cooper matter.   In late April 1991, John H. Gutfreund, Thomas W. Strauss, and John W.Meriwether, three members of Salomon's most senior management, learned thatPaul Mozer, the head of the firm's government trading desk, had submitted afalse bid in an auction of Treasury securities. Promptly upon learning ofthe false bid, these three senior managers and Donald M. Feuerstein,Salomon's chief legal officer, convened and discussed Mozer's misconduct.They concluded that Mozer's misconduct should be reported to thegovernment. Nevertheless, they did not even discuss ``investigating whatMozer had done disciplining him, or placing limits on hisactivities.''11   Salomon's supervisors compounded this failure by not acting on theirdecision to self-report for more than three months. In the interim, Mozercommitted additional violations of the securities laws. In early July 1991,Salomon retained outside counsel to investigate a separate allegation ofmisconduct relating to the government trading desk. In the course of thatinvestigation, Feuerstein disclosed Mozer's earlier misconduct to counsel.Thereafter, counsel widened its inquiry and uncovered additionalauction-related misconduct.   In August 1991, four months after concluding that Mozer had engaged insubstantial misconduct, Salomon finally suspended Mozer and three othersand publicly disclosed that it had uncovered irregularities on itsgovernment trading desk. Within days, Gutfreund, Strauss, Meriwether, andFeuerstein resigned their positions.The Commission's CriticismThe Securities Exchange Act imposes upon broker-dealers a specific duty tosupervise that does not explicitly apply to other public companies.12Failure to meet supervisory obligations can serve as a basis forsanctioning individuals as well as the broker-dealer itself. Gutfreund,Strauss, and Meriwether each were sternly punished for their failure tosupervise.13Although section 15 reaches only broker-dealers and the employees ofbroker-dealers, it would be naive for any public company to ignore theclear duty to respond set forth in Gutfreund:14   The supervisory obligations imposed by the federal securities lawsrequire a vigorous response even to indications of wrongdoing. Many of theCommission's cases involving a failure to supervise arise from situationswhere supervisors were aware only of ``red flags'' or ``suggestions'' ofirregularity, rather than situations where, as here, supervisors wereexplicitly informed of an illegal act.   Even where the knowledge of supervisors is limited to ``red flags'' or``suggestions'' of irregularity, they cannot discharge their supervisoryobligations simply by relying on the unverified representations ofemployees. Instead, as the Commission has repeatedly emphasized, [t]heremust be adequate follow-up and review when a firm's own procedures detectirregularities or unusual trading activity.'' Moreover, if more than onesupervisor is involved in considering the actions to be taken in responseto possible misconduct, there must be clear definition of the efforts to betaken and a clear assignment of those responsibilities to specificindividuals within the firm.   In Gutfreund, the Commission upbraided Salomon's managers for theirfailure to investigate responsibly ``what had occurred and whether therehad been other instances of unreported misconduct.'' Until that inquiry wascomplete, Salomon should have increased supervision of Mozer andappropriately limited his activities.   Another precedent, In the Matter of the Boston Company, Inc., provides astark and encouraging contrast to the results in Gutfreund. There theCommission lightly sanctioned Boston Co.'s management because, in theCommission's view, it had met its obligations under the duty to respond. Asset forth in the Commission's report, Boston Co. used improper accountingpractices and, as a result, overstated its income by $44 million for thefirst three quarters of 1988. As a result, Boston Co.'s parent, ShearsonLehman Brothers, overstated its income for the same period.15A portion of the overstatement resulted from the improper characterizationof certain income and expenses, done at the direction of ``certain''company officers. Citing the exemplary response of management from bothcompanies, including the firing of Boston Co.'s CEO, the institution ofinternal controls, and cooperation with the SEC, the Commission issued asimple ``cease and desist'' order against Boston Co. and took no actionagainst Shearson.16 According to one news report of the settlement, theCommission chose leniency over the stiffer sanctions recommended by itsenforcement staff because of management's response upon the discovery ofmisconduct.THE DUTY TO RESPONDWith the Cooper and Gutfreund cases, the Commission has imposed upon thesenior managers of public companies the obligation to ``take immediate anddecisive corrective action'' when ``confronted with serious indications ofmanagement fraud.'' In practice, this duty to respond requires that, uponlearning of allegations of misconduct, management and the board (i)investigate the allegations to determine whether they are substantial, (ii)take steps to deter repetition of any misconduct, and (iii) if warranted,sanction the employees involved.   This duty does not necessarily require that a company report itsfindings to the government,17 although such a duty may arise from anothersource.18 Alternatively, the company may also determine that the benefitsof self-reporting exceed the almost certain costs.19In sum, Cooper and Gutfreund should be read to impose a duty to act ratherthan wait for government reaction. The company is obligated to investigate,make a determination, and act based on that determination. It is importantto note that the duty to respond is not an obligation to accede to everygovernment allegation of misconduct. Rather, the duty is met whenmanagement can answer a regulator's questions by stating, ``We responsiblyinvestigated the alleged misconduct and took the actions that we deemedappropriate based upon that responsible investigation.''20Meaningful InvestigationWhen management reasonably suspects that an employee has engaged inmisconduct that has brought a benefit to the company, the company shouldconduct a meaningful investigation of the misconduct. The scope of ameaningful investigation differs with the situation, but it always includestwo steps. The company must first review relevant company documents andthen interview current employees with access to relevant information. Ifthese two steps are not completed, company management will have failed inits duty to respond and both management and the company will face increasedjeopardy of being charged.   A meaningful investigation can be completed by internal counsel,accounting, business, or compliance personnel. Conducting a reviewinternally does raise certain risks, however. A review conducted bynon-legal personnel will not be protected from discovery by theattorney-client privilege.21 Similarly, review should never be conducted bypersonnel who had even tangential connection to the conduct under review.Where an employee is both a fact witness and an investigator, thelikelihood that the results of the internal investigation will be disclosedincreases greatly.22 At the same time, internal counsel may not havesufficient perspective to conduct an arm's-length review and the frictiongenerated by an internal inquiry can limit the ability of internal counselto conduct his or her day-to-day advisory duties.   No hard and fast rule governs whether and when employees should beinvited to retain their own counsel.23 Typically, independent employeecounsel is not used at the beginning of an investigation. At such an earlystage, the company does not know whether the employee's interests havediverged from the company's. The employee must be fully informed, however,that counsel is representing the company, not him or her personally.24 Theinvestigating counsel should specifically advise the employee that theresults of his or her interview will be used in the company's bestinterests and that the company controls the use of interview notes ormemoranda. Such use may include disclosure to the government if the companylater determines to waive its own privilege.   Separate representation is advisable when and if the employee'sinterests are no longer co-extensive with the company's. A strong employeedefense benefits the company since the company may be vicariously liablefor the employee's wrongful conduct.25 By retaining separate employeecounsel, a company can present a separate face to an investigatingregulator or prosecutor. For example, if the company chooses to adopt aconciliatory posture, employee counsel will be able to defend aggressivelya position that company counsel could not advocate. Finally, internalinquiries strain company morale. Some of that strain may be mitigated ifemployees perceive that the company will support their separate defense.   Regardless of whether the company provides employee defense,management's primary obligation is to ensure that employees central to theinquiry are interviewed. The employee, no matter what his or her level ofmanagement, cannot be permitted to refuse to speak with the company'sinvestigators. As the Cooper matter makes clear, failure to interview thecentral subjects in an internal inquiry results in the unification ofinterests -- and outcomes -- for the company and the individual.26 Wherethe employee did not act wrongfully, such an identity of interests isappropriate; where the employee did act wrongfully, the company mustseparate its interests from the individual's. The only way a company canmake that evaluation is by learning the facts. A company that must concedeto a regulator or prosecutor that it failed to interview the centralsubject has forfeited its ability to argue compellingly that it should beviewed differently from an errant employee.   Ultimately, the company's obligation is to inquire into a situationthoroughly enough to determine whether wrongful conduct occurred. Cooperstands for the proposition that a company is obliged to reach its ownindependent conclusions and act based upon those conclusions rather thanpostpone that responsibility by waiting for a regulator, prosecutor, orcourt to reach judgment.27 A regulator expects the company to accept theresponsibility of supervising employee conduct rather than demurring andrelying upon government action.28Ensuring That It Will Not Happen AgainThe Gutfreund matter likely would have been more containable had managementpromptly inquired into Mozer's prior conduct upon first learning of thefalse bid. Instead, the company's exposure increased dramatically whenmisconduct on the treasury desk repeated itself after management's initialdiscovery. In effect, Salomon lost its ability to argue convincingly thatit had been deceived by its own employee. By failing to take correctivesteps, management allowed misconduct to happen on management's watch.29A company discovering employee misconduct must act to ensure that suchmisconduct will not happen again. Often corrective steps may involve nomore than increased supervision. Pre-clearing employee activity by animmediate supervisor frequently fulfills this need.   On occasion, more is required. Counsel may recommend that new businessor compliance policies be adopted. The company may determine during thecourse of its investigation that it wants to change the way it pursues aparticular business or exit that business entirely. Particularly whereclass action or shareholder suits loom a company may determine thatbusiness practices should change.Internal SanctionsThe internal review may reveal that the employee has acted wrongfully. Thecompany must act on this information. In the most extreme circumstances, anemployee may have to be terminated and/or reported to a regulator. Moreoften, the appropriate sanction will be a change in job responsibilities ortitle or a reduction in bonus or some other economic penalty.   By acting decisively, the company not only strengthens its argument thatit should be judged separately from the employee, it also gains credibilityin the government's investigative process. By appropriately sanctioning anemployee who has acted wrongfully, the company bolsters its ability toargue that another employee acted correctly. The company in effectvalidates its vote on the conduct of the employees it will aggressivelydefend.   Companies in a regulated industry engage in a constant dialogue withtheir regulators. How a company acts in one circumstance will condition theregulator's expectation in the next. A company that is not perceived asaccepting the responsibility of self-regulation will have difficultyconvincing the government that its fate should be considered separatelyfrom the fate of the employee in trouble.About the Author(s):*JOHN K.

Indeed, it may be argued thatthe availability of a Section 15 remedy in the broker-dealer contextalleviates the pressure to seek vicarious punishment of the institutionpredicated upon the misconduct of the employee. Inevitably, the Section 15remedy separates the conduct of the institution and its supervisors fromthat of errant employees. Where a separate remedy is unavailable, thedistinction between the interests of the institution and the interests ofthe errant employee may become muddied.15.

OF SEC. & COMMODITIES REGS. via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996   Vol. 29, NASSET CONCENTRATION ISSUES IN REAL ESTATE SECURITIZATIONSBy:Karsten P. Giesecke and Michael Ready Treanor, Jr.*The volume of new issuances of commercial (including multifamily)mortgage-backed securities (``CMBSs'') has grown at a tremendous pace since1991, and significantly more CMBSs are likely to be issued in the future.For example, only two percent of non-multifamily commercial mortgage loanshave been securitized.1 Much of this increased CMBS volume has been in theform of registered public offerings, even though public offerings of CMBSsimplicate co-registration and disclosure issues not present in traditionalmortgage or asset-backed transactions. Disclosure issues arise in a CMBStransaction largely due to the economic significance of individual mortgageloans that back a CMBS. In particular, where individual mortgage loans or agroup of related mortgage loans constitute a significant portion of theassets underlying a CMBS offering, borrowers or other parties may berequired to sign the registration statement as ``co-issuers,'' or the usermay be required to provide financial disclosure regarding the borrowers orthe properties backing such a CMBS. This article will discuss the currentrules governing co-issuer registration and financial disclosure applicableto registered CMBS offerings.COMMERCIAL OR MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIESMortgage-backed securities are securities backed by one or more mortgageloans in a structure designed to protect investors from credit risks (otherthan those associated with the underlying mortgage loans), particularlyagainst claims by creditors of the issuer or sponsor of the transaction.Such securities can therefore be rated based on anticipated cash flowsfrom, and credit risks associated with, such mortgage loans.   Registration of public mortgage-backed securities may be accomplishedunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act''), by filinga registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the``Commission''), usually using either form S-11 or form S-3. Form S-11 maybe used for the registration of securities of certain real estate companiesand is available for the issuance of either (i) securities issued by realestate investment trusts, or (ii) securities issued by issuers whoseprimary business is that of acquiring, and holding for investment, realestate or interests in real estate or interests in other issuers whosebusiness is investing in real estate.2 Since amendments made to form S-3 asannounced in the Commission's Rel. No. 33-6964 (1992) (the ``Asset-BackedShelf Release''), form S-3 is available to, among others, issuers of``asset-backed securities'' that are offered for cash and which are``investment grade.''3 Unlike form S-11, form S-3 permits the issuer toincorporate by reference reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of1934, as amended (the ``1934 Act''). Only issuers using form S-3 have theadditional benefit of the no-action position of the staff of theCommission's Division of Corporation Finance (the ``Staff''), which permitsdelivery of certain computational materials and collateral informationbefore delivery of a final prospectus.4 Registrants using both form S-3and form S-11 may also be able to offer securities on a delayed basispursuant to the Commission's 1933 Act rule 415.5   Mortgage loans backing traditional single-family residentialmortgage-backed securities generally contain large numbers of homogeneousmortgage loans, thereby rendering each individual mortgage loanstatistically insignificant and allowing rating agencies to rate atransaction based on a statistical analysis of the pool as a whole. TheCommission similarly has concluded that, for traditional single-familyresidential mortgage-backed securities, financial information concerningthe related borrowers is unimportant to the investment decision.6 Incontrast, because the initial principal balance of a typical commercial ormultifamily mortgage loan is much higher than the principal balance of theindividual obligations backing other securitizations of pooled assets, CMBSpools often include fewer mortgage loans, with each individual assetrepresenting a larger percentage of the pool (an ``assetconcentration'').7   The Commission has identified two principal consequences of assetconcentration. First, the Commission has indicated that ``asset-backedofferings with significant asset concentration may involve one or moreco-issuers under Securities Act Rule 140.'' In addition, the Commission hasindicated that ``if a significant amount of the asset pool represents theobligations of a single obligor or related obligors, financial informationand other disclosure about the obligor(s) may be required.''   In the Asset-Backed Shelf Release the staff declined expressly toidentify asset concentration limits, indicating instead that existingdisclosure rules would continue to apply. The Staff has since settled onthree key concentration levels as being important. A mortgage loanrepresenting 45 percent of a pool triggers co-issuer requirements, amortgage loan representing over 20 percent of a pool triggers requirementsto file full audited property-level financial statements, and a mortgageloan representing over 10 percent of a pool triggers requirements forcondensed unaudited property-level financial statements.CO-REGISTRATION AND RULE 140The Asset-Backed Shelf Release stated that securities backed by the assetsof a single obligor or group of related obligors are not ``asset-backedsecurities'' for purposes of the new form S-3 rules.8 As a result, anissuer relying on characterization of its securities as ``asset-backedsecurities'' to make such securities eligible for form S-3 and shelfregistration under rule 4159 must involve at least two obligors or groupsof related obligors.10Of greater significance than the prohibition against shelf registration forsingle obligor pools is the requirement that, where significant assetconcentration exists, one or more borrowers with respect to the underlyingmortgage loans may be required to co-register the issuance of thesecurities.11 Rule 140 of the 1933 Act provides that:[a] person, the chief part of whose business consists of the purchase ofthe securities of one issuer, or of two or more affiliated issuers, and thesale of its own securities ... is to be regarded as engaged in thedistribution of the securities of such issuer or affiliated issuers withinthe meaning of Section 2(11) of the [1933 Act]. [emphasis added]   In simpler terms, rule 140 provides that when an issuer of a security(the ``Delivered Security'') uses the proceeds of the sale of the DeliveredSecurity to acquire securities of another issuer (the ``UnderlyingSecurity'') from such issuer, the issuer of the Delivered Security is alsodeemed to be engaged in a distribution of the Underlying Security.Accordingly, the Underlying Security is also being publicly offered and the``issuer'' of the Delivered Security, who is deemed to be directlyaccessing the capital markets, must sign the related registration statementas a registrant in the public offering of the Delivered Security. The viewof the Staff that rule 140 is applicable in the context of a commercialmortgage loan-backed securitization suggests that the Staff views mortgageloans (including those providing for recourse only against the mortgagedproperty) as securities requiring registration if sold in a publicoffering.12   In order to determine the applicability of rule 140 to a particularsecuritization, it is necessary to determine whether the ``chief part'' ofthe business of the issuer of the Delivered Security is the purchase ofUnderlying Securities of a single obligor or related obligors. The Staffhas taken the position that where obligations backing securities includethe obligations of a single obligor or related obligors constituting atleast 45 percent of the mortgage loan pool backing such securities, rule140 is implicated and such obligor or related obligors must co-register.   Rule 140 has generally been viewed as applying only where a personpurchases securities from an issuer, and therefore, would not apply wheremortgage loans made to a non-affiliate are acquired in the secondary marketand not from the borrower. In addition, there have been indications fromthe Staff that it is reconsidering the inapplicability of rule 140 to suchsecondary market purchases and may expand its breadth.13 In the context ofcommercial mortgage securitization, the Staff has taken a broader position,to the effect that rule 140 applies if the issuer of the UnderlyingSecurity financially benefits from the securitization (as a result of whichthe issuer of the Delivered Security may have leverage to require theinvolvement of the issuer of the Underlying Security in the offering of theDelivered Security). In such cases, it is appropriate to determine whether``significant involvement'' exists based on the individual facts andcircumstances presented.   Where co-registration is required, securities which might have beeneligible for issuance under rule 415 of the 1933 Act on a delayed orcontinuous basis (i.e., a shelf registration) will now, as a practicalmatter, be required to be registered on a separate registration statement(i.e., on a one-off basis) because of the need to include the relatedobligor as a co-registrant.14 This has the effect of increasing the costsassociated with a CMBS transaction by requiring the preparation of a fullregistration statement for each new issue. In addition to the time andexpense of issuing securities on a one-off basis, forcing an obligor toco-register means that the obligor will be liable as an issuer under the1933 Act and the 1934 Act and may become subject to the reportingrequirements of the 1934 Act.15   In addition, the co-registration concentration levels trigger issuerfinancial statement disclosure requirements with respect to the obligor ofthe Underlying Security. Under regulation S-X, sections 3-01 and 3-02, theborrower's financial statements must be included in the disclosure topotential securityholders. Regulation S-X, section 3-01 requires eachregistrant to file a consolidated audited balance sheet as of the end ofeach of the two most recent fiscal years or, if the registrant has been inexistence for less than one fiscal year, as of a date within 135 days ofthe date of filing the registration statement.16 Furthermore, section 3-02requires the registrant to file a consolidated audited statement ``ofincome and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years preceding the dateof the most recent audited balance sheet being filed or such shorter periodas the registrant (including predecessors) has been in existence.''17 Forfilings made more than 134 days after the end of the fiscal year, anunaudited interim balance sheet and a corresponding statement of income andcash flows must be provided.18   In a typical CMBS securitization, the mortgagor is often a newly-createdspecial purpose entity which has as its sole asset the ownership of theunderlying real property, and, accordingly, it might be expected that themortgagor's financial statements only cover a short period of time. Therequirement of section 3-02 that the registrant's statement of income andcash flows include predecessor businesses may, however, create significantdifficulty if mortgage loan borrower financial statements are required.Since the special purpose vehicle may be considered a successor to theearlier business from which it acquired the property, financial statementsof such predecessor business may be required. Such predecessor financialstatements may not be readily obtainable. Section 3-05 of regulation S-Xaddresses predecessor business financial disclosure and indicates that adetermination of whether a business has been acquired is to be made withreference to the guidance set forth in regulations S-X, section 11-01(d).Under section 11-01(d), an acquisition of a business occurs when, in lightof the facts and circumstances involved, ``there is sufficient continuityof the acquired entity's operations prior to and after the transactions sothat disclosure of prior financial information is material to anunderstanding of future operations.''19 Such continuity is more likely tobe viewed as present if the special purpose vehicle is related to the priorobligor. To resolve predecessor business issues, it is likely that adiscussion with the Chief Accountant's Office of the Commission would beappropriate.PROPERTY-LEVEL FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAs previously indicated, in instances where sufficient asset concentrationexists, the Commission requires disclosure of financial informationconcerning the specific assets constituting the pool.   The Staff has taken the position that, in the event that a singlemortgage loan exceeds 20 percent of the pool, audited financial statementswith respect to the property, as described in sections 3-01 and 3-02 ofregulation S-X, are required. As described above, sections 3-01 and 3-02generally require audited balance sheets for the two most recent fiscalyears and audited income statements and statements of cash flows for thethree fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balancesheet being filed. In addition, for filings made after 134 days subsequentto the most recent fiscal year, a balance sheet as of an interim datewithin 135 days of the date of filing together with a related interimstatement of income and cash flows, which in each case may be unaudited,must be provided. Staff Accounting Bulletins 71 and 71A (``SAB 71/71A'')state that where ``the amount of a loan exceeds 20 percent of the amount ingood faith expected to be raised in the offering, disclosure would beexpected to consist of financial statements for the underlying operatingproperties for the periods contemplated by rule 3-14,''20 which indicatesthat, for acquired properties, financial statements are for shorterperiods. Rule 3-14 does not apply in the case of acquired businesses,however, as to which rule 3-01 and 3-02 financials (including as requiredfor predecessor businesses) must be included. In many cases (including inparticular where the acquired assets are in the form of a business, such ashotel or nursing home loans), the Staff has viewed acquired mortgage loansas acquired businesses.   The Staff has taken the position that ``condensed'' financialinformation should be provided as to assets that constitute more than 10percent but not more than 20 percent of the entire pool.21 Condensedfinancial information is financial information generally presented inaccordance with article X of regulation S-X and generally consists ofconsolidated unaudited statements similar to those required in a form 10-Qfiling under the 1934 Act.ADDITIONAL ASSET CONCENTRATION ISSUESWhile the Staff's position with respect to asset concentration providesguidance to CMBS issuers, it leaves unresolved many issues regardingexactly what constitutes asset concentration. In particular, in whatinstances do the relationships between borrowers, cross-collateralization,common tenants, or other common features between mortgage loans result insuch mortgage loans being treated as a single mortgage loan for theforegoing analysis, or result in the underlying borrowers being treated asa single borrower? The analysis is a factual one resolved on a case-by-casebasis, generally after prior consultation with the Staff. Nevertheless,certain guidelines are available.   In the instance of a pool consisting of fully cross-collateralized andcross-defaulted mortgage loans securing the debt of unrelated obligors, theStaff has indicated that such a pool would be treated as a single loansubject to the 10 percent or 20 percent financial reporting standards, asappropriate, even though the individual obligors may be completelyunrelated.22 In addition, the underlying borrowers are generally regardedby the Staff as a single borrower under the assumption that they are actingin concert. This may not be the case where it can be proven that theunrelated obligors have voluntarily cross-collateralized andcross-defaulted without the expectation of a pecuniary or other benefit,which would seem to be an exceedingly rare situation.   In addition to obligor-based asset concentration, other types ofconcentration may trigger the need for additional financial disclosure. Inthe event that there is a concentration of tenants, financial statementsfor such tenants may be required,23 although it is unclear at what level ofconcentration such financial statements will be required, and, if required,the nature of such financial statements (i.e., audited or condensed).24Furthermore, in the event of a concentration of managers, the Staff hasindicated that it may require financial statements for such managersbecause of a perception that the bankruptcy of a significant manager couldaffect securityholders.25About the Author(s):*KARSTEN P.

Watterson, Commercial Mortgage Securitizations, Rev. of Sec. and Comm.Reg. (Sept. 14, 1994.)2. See General Instructions to form S-11.3. ``Asset-backed securities'' include qualifying mortgage-backedsecurities (including commercial mortgage-backed securities). ``Investmentgrade'' means that at the time of the sale to the public, the securitiesare rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical ratingorganization in one of its generic rating categories signifying investmentgrade (typically one of the four highest categories). Form S-3 is alsogenerically available to large, widely-held issuers, to subsidiaries ofsuch companies, and for securities guaranteed by such companies. SeeGeneral Instructions to form S-3.4. Because mortgage-backed securities are frequently not structured (andtherefore a final prospectus cannot be printed) until after certaininstitutional investors have decided on their particular requirements afterreceipt of certain information, the Staff has permitted delivery byregistrants of asset-backed securities on form S-3 of certain computationalmaterials and collateral information prior to the delivery of a finalprospectus. See Kidder, Peabody Acceptance Corporation I (avail. May 20,1994); Public Securities Association (avail. May 27, 1994).5. Rule 415 or, as it is commonly referred to, the ``shelf rule'', permitscertain securities to be offered on a delayed or continuous basis, therebyavoiding the necessity of preparing a new registration statement for eachoffering, and thus greatly speeding up the time required to issue newsecurities and reducing related costs. Rule 415 is available to offeringswhich ``qualify'' for form S-3 and, therefore, in the event an offering``qualifies'' for form S-3, the offering may be registered under anotherform (such as form S-1 or form S-11) and still offer securities ``off theshelf''. Rule 415 is also available for ``mortgage-related securities,''which include certain securities rated in one of the two highest ratingcategories by a nationally recognized statistical rating agency and whichare backed by qualifying residential mortgage loans.6. The Commission indicated in the Asset-Backed Shelf Release that in asituation where asset-backed securities are secured ``by a pool offinancial assets representing obligations of a large number of obligors ...the information about the financial condition of any one obligor is notimportant to an investment decision.''7. Larger pools of commercial or multifamily mortgage loans may avoidasset concentration issues. This is particularly true for ``conduit''programs providing for acquisition of mortgage loans from multiple sourceswhich, as part of the program parameters, limit the size of mortgage loansspecifically to avoid asset concentration concerns.8. Id. at page 22 ``... the definition does not encompass securitiesissued in structured financings for one obligor or related group ofobligors''. See also Rel. No. 33-6943 (notice of proposed rulemaking) at 25(``Structured financings would not be considered asset-backed securitiesfor the purposes of the proposed revisions to form S-3 where a substantialportion of the underlying assets are originated by one obligor (includingaffiliated entities).'')9. Single-loan multifamily mortgage-backed securities may still beeligible for shelf registration if they constitute ``mortgage-relatedsecurities'' as used in rule 415.10. As described below, unless the underlying mortgage loans were acquiredin secondary market purchases so that rule 140 would not apply, orco-registrants are already included in the shelf registration statement, asa practical matter at least three obligors or groups of obligors would berequired.11. In the Asset-Backed Shelf Release, the Staff stated that, in instanceswhere there is significant asset concentration, such an asset-backedoffering ``may involve one or more co-issuers under rule 140.''12. But see Bob Reves, et al. v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56 (1990).13. Although open-market purchases of commercial mortgage loans may nottrigger rule 140 (assuming no involvement at all by the obligors under suchloans in the new offering and regardless of the existence of assetconcentration with respect to the mortgage loans), they could potentiallytrigger the requirement for property-level financial statements in theevent that mortgage loans of a single obligor or group of related obligorsexceed the 10% or 20% thresholds described below.14. The Staff has taken the position that the amendment of a shelfregistration statement so as to add or change a co-registrant is notpermissible.15. But see Linpro Income Fund I Partnership (avail.

SAB 71, interpretive response to Question 1.21. Comments of Linda Quinn, Director of the Division of CorporateFinance, at the ABA Annual Meeting on August 9-10, 1994. The requirement toprovide condensed financial information is not based on any publishedposition of the Commission. Indeed there is some authority indicating thataudited financial statements would be required, at least with respect toinvestment-type arrangements. In the Staff Accounting Bulletins, Topic 1 --Financial Statements, I. Financial Statements of Properties SecuringMortgage Loans, the Staff indicated that ``separate audited financialstatements should be provided for any investment-type arrangement thatconstitutes 10% or more of the greater of (i) the amount of minimumproceeds, or (ii) the total assets of the registrant, including the amountof proceeds raised'' and this language has been cited by the Staff insupport of its asset concentration thresholds. Of course, the Commissionbases its standards only in part on the Staff Accounting Bulletins, as theinterpretive responses in Topic 1 were not specifically drafted for CMBStransactions.22. Such an analysis would create the result that audited property levelfinancial statements should be included on an aggregate basis. Suchfinancial statements, however, are not always available and the exactnature of financial disclosure must generally be resolved in discussionswith the Staff.23. Unlike the requirement for obligor financials which, in a non-recoursetransaction, is of nominal investor interest, financial informationconcerning major tenants appears to be of significant investor interest asthe availability of funds to pay securityholders will depend on thetimeliness of the lease payments by major tenants.24. The Staff has indicated that, in cases where there is tenantconcentration but the tenant is not involved in the offering (and,accordingly, audited financial statements, and related auditors' consents,cannot be obtained), the transaction may still proceed as a registeredpublic offering provided that the tenant is a publicly reporting companyand its public filings (including audited financial statements) can bereferenced in the prospectus.25. This view is mitigated by provisions in the relevant documents whichprovide for replacement of the manager and the use of a lockbox or othermechanism to protect the cash flow from creditors of the manager.Information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable.However, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness is not guaranteed.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List WT03-B39-21IA060-000326-B015-380http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi73.html 205.156.212.5 19970115013225 text/html 32537HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:30:35 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:21 GMTContent-length: 32348Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi73.html Sample Issue Copyright THRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNet June 15, 1992 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES ADMINISTRATION SEEKS REPEAL OF KEY AUDITING REQUIREMENTS IBAA Pushes Reforms (537 words) IRS DEBT RESERVE PROPOSAL SETS OFF THRIFT OBJECTIONS (581 words) FASBS NEW UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES PROJECT DEALS WITH ISSUE OF JOINT VENTURE FINANCING (539 words) INCIDENTS OF FRAUD BY INDUSTRY ACCOUNTANTS SHOW DISTURBING UPWARD TREND, FBI SAYS (723 words) THRIFT ACCOUNTING LEDGER OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION (395 words) FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (199 words) FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (158 words) GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE (105 words) FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (449 words) AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CPAS (64 words) THE OPINION PAGE PROPOSED IRS LOAN LOSS RECAPTURE RULE FOR S&LS HEAVILY CRITICIZED BY TAX LAWYER (692 words) CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992ADMINISTRATION SEEKS REPEAL OF KEY AUDITING REQUIREMENTSIBAA Pushes ReformsIn response to banking industry pressure, the Bushadministration is drafting legislation that would undo several keyauditing and regulatory requirements contained in the 1991 FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).     If submitted, the bill could set the stage for aheated fight pitting the administration against congressionalDemocrats and Republicans who feel the requirements are necessary toprotect federal deposit insurance funds.     The proposal, requested by the Independent BankersAssociation of America (IBAA), would repeal a FDICIA provisionrequiring outside ratios of market value to book value for publiclytraded bank and thrift stocks.      Permit rural financial institutions with less than$100 million in assets to self-certify their compliance with theCommunity Reinvestment Act.      Allow regulators to grant all institutions CRAcredit for making loans to depressed areas that are outside aninstitutions delineated community.      Clarify that the standards for safety and soundnessmandated by the FDICIA do not require micro-management ofinstitutions management and operations.      Repeal the small business and small farm reportingrequirements imposed by the FDICIA.      Postpone for a year the truth-in-savings provisionof the FDICIA.      Specify that the FDICIAs aggregate lending limitexceptions for insider loans would also apply to loans secured byTreasury obligations.      Repeal a FDICIA provision requiring regulatoryagencies to establish detailed compensation standards for officers,directors and employees of healthy institutions.      Require regulators to demonstrate immediate andirreparable harm before seizing or freezing assets in advance of anadministrative law judge hearing of accused institution officers,directors and outside professionals.     According to the IBAA, the above amendments actuallyconstitute a scaled-back list of regulatory reforms theadministration feels it can implement this year if a majority in thebanking and insurance industries agree to a broader legislativepackage on interstate banking liberalization. That package includessubstantial home office protection for banks and thrifts in smallercommunities, reauthorization of insurance sales by community banks intowns of less than 5,000 people and limitations on court-sanctionedinsurance underwriting and sales by the nations largest banks.     Interestingly enough, a bill that would mandate someof the FDICIA reforms sought by the administration and the IBAA hasbeen introduced by Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan.     Doles legislation would exempt institutions withunder $100 million in assets from CRA requirements if they arelocated in towns with populations of 20,000 or less. It also wouldprovide a CRA safe harbor for institutions with assets of $300million or less, if they have satisfactory CRA ratings.     The bill would require banking regulators tocoordinate their actions to ensure consistency and uniformity ofstandards.     It would clarify that regulators are empowered to setlevels below which certified or licensed appraisers are not requiredto perform appraisals.     Moreover, the measure would require regulators toperform an economic impact analysis on any rule that affects morethan 20% of all small institutions.     In addition to the reforms, Doles legislation wouldimpose a 15-month moratorium on Office of Thrift Supervision approvalof any interstate branching applications by federal associationssubmitted under a rule that became effective last month.     The IBAA opposes the regulation, fearing that itcould prompt large banks to seek interstate branching equity in thefederal courts.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992IRS DEBT RESERVE PROPOSAL SETS OFF THRIFT OBJECTIONSAn Internal Revenue Service proposal to tighten thetax requirements on bad debt reserves of savings and loanassociations has triggered loud protests from the thrift industry.     The tempest was ignited by an IRS plan to requireS&Ls immediately to recapture into income their bad debt reserveswhen they change to a commercial bank charter or when they diversifyand their home mortgage-related assets decline below 60% of theirtotal assets.     In other words, the entire amount of bad debtreserves would have to be included immediately in an institutionstaxable income instead of being capitalized over the life of thetroubled debt portfolio involved.     Under the IRS revision, thrifts that switch chartersor flunk the IRS version of the thrift lender test would beconfronted with a much harsher tax schedule than commercial banks,one that would place them at a competitive disadvantage, the S&Lindustry argues.     Moreover, it would prevent thrifts from expandingtheir services more fully to meet the needs of their customers,contends the Savings & Community Bankers of America (SCBA), a newtrade group formed by the merger of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions and the National Council of Community Bankers. The SCBAcontends that the IRS regulation would thwart the TreasuryDepartments broader efforts to modernize the banking industry andpermit savings institutions to offer a wider array of products andservices. Asserting that there is no statutory language authorizingIRS to alter the existing bad debt reserve formula, the SCBArecommends that the agency withdraw its proposed rule.     IRS set procedures for bad debt reserve recaptureafter commercial banks were compelled to recapture their reserves inaccordance with the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The new procedures permittedbanks to pay the tax over the life of the loan portfolio to which thereserve applied.     For thrifts, however, the agency is proposing, ineffect, a more rapid bad debt reserve repayment schedule if theychange charters or fail the IRS version of the thrift lender test.     During a hearing before IRS this week, Abraham Ossip,an SCBA representative, warned that the proposal would generate asevere problem for institutions with large reserves built up between1950 and 1980, when Congress gave thrifts an incentive for acommitment to home mortgage lending by authorizing large additions tothe bad debt reserve.     Ossip, corporate tax director for the Dime SavingsBank in New York, maintained that existing IRS regulations stronglyindicate that savings institutions should be allowed to switchcommercial bank charters without tax penalty as long as they remaincommitted to residential lending.     In a lengthy supporting document filed with IRS, SCBAanalysts point out that a distinguishing difference between thereserves of banks and thrifts is that thrifts historically werepermitted much larger reserve additions with respect to theirqualifying loansprincipally residential mortgage loans.     The reserve additions to the qualifying reserve boreno relationship to any anticipation of actual loan losses whencomputed as a percentage of taxable income, the trade groupemphasizes. This percentage, which could have been as high as 100% oftaxable income at the inception of thrift taxability, was graduallyphased down until the 1986 Tax Reform Act set the current percentageat 8% of taxable income.     This statutory requirement, designed to safeguard thecapital levels of thrifts, created a standard of qualifying levelsfor historically profitable S&ls that was far in excess of that whichwould have been established using the bank reserve method, the SCBAnotes.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992FASBS NEW UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES PROJECT DEALS WITH ISSUE OFJOINT VENTURE FINANCINGThe Financial Accounting Standards Board is studyingwhether to require companies that enter into a joint venture to bookdebt used to finance part of the venture.     The FASB proposal would change current practice,which requires that such debt be treated as an off-balance-sheetfinancing.     The proposed change would be in line with the viewsof regulators, who think this item should appear on companies books.Failure to disclose the liability could mislead users regarding thetrue financial condition of the company, banking regulators argue.     The project is part of a broader attempt by FASB todevelop accounting and reporting standards for affiliated entities,an area that is being watched closely by bank regulators.     The Board will discuss the diverse accounting methodsused by various industries,including international accountingstandards, for joint ventures on June 16, according to FASB ProjectManager Ron Lott. In addition, FASB staff will present case studiesthat show current inconsistencies and the problems they spawn, hesays.     Banks and thrifts that establish joint ventures withother entitiesa real estate developer, for examplewould be includedin the scope of the project. Some banks have joint ventures in dataprocessing.     But initially, the Board will avoid using the termjoint venture because it means different things to different people,says Lott. The Board will try first to develop a uniform standardwithout making distinctions between types of joint ventures. If thatdoesnt work, then the Board may be forced to come up with a formaldefinition of joint venture.     Commonly, people think of joint venture as being aninvestment by two people, each owning an equal amount and exercisingjoint control over the investment, Lott says. This is typical in asituation involving real estate.     According to Lott, the absence of any clear standardfor reporting joint ventures has led industries to use varyingmethods. For instance, one company used three methodsequity method,proportionate consolidation and costin accounting for various jointventures.     And those are just three methods I could name off thetop of my head. There may be other methods without names, Lott says.     Current rules for consolidation require a 50%ownership of a subsidiarys common stock. The equity method is used byan investor who owns between 20% and 50% of the companys commonstock, although there are situations when an investor may use thismethod even though more than 50% is owned. The cost method is used ifownership is 20% or lessa stock investment that is required to bemarked to lower of cost or market.     According to Lott, entities that fall between the 20%to 50% range will fall within the scope of the joint venture project.It affects anything not covered by either the consolidation standardor the stock investment standard, says Lott.     Other projects focusing on other aspects of theconsolidation issue also are under way. Two discussion memoranda areout for comment: New Basis Accounting and Consolidation Policy andProcedures. The Board decided to consider the need for and timing ofpublic hearings on both documents after comments, due by July 15,1992, are received.     The Board also has commissioned a research study ondisaggregated disclosures, which is expected to be completed laterthis year.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992INCIDENTS OF FRAUD BY INDUSTRY ACCOUNTANTS SHOW DISTURBING UPWARDTREND, FBI SAYSGeorge BrooksFraud is on the rise at financial institutionsnationwide and the perpetrators are no longer from within the teller-to-middle-management range, according to an FBI expert on fraud.     Accounting staff committed 13% of about 150embezzlements over $250,000 in institutions across California, forexample, Special Agent Robert DeMaria told accountants attending arecent meeting of the Financial Managers Society in San Francisco. Atleast 13% of the total dollar losses in the 350 cases of fraudreported last year in the state wound up in accountants pockets.     The FBIs profile of an embezzler is a person 33 yearsof age who has been with a company at least five and a half years,and with an average time on the job of more than three years. Theembezzlers work performance rating usually ranges from good toexcellent or outstanding.     The potential embezzler is a highly desirableemployee, reliable, bright, motivated, and trustworthy, says DeMaria.He or she is an achiever with high self-esteem, an independent workerwho is self-sufficient and has good self-control.     The embezzler is married with children, optimistic,empathetic, well-educated and has never been arrested. His or hergreatest fear is being found out by family and friends, DeMariaconcludes.     Leading DeMarias list is collusion between insidersand outsiders (39% of incidents, resulting in 32% of total losses),followed by electronic data processing and support staff (19% ofincidents, resulting in 22% of total losses). Warehouse personnelequalled accountants notoriety by committing 13% of reported fraudbut ended with less cash in their pockets7% of total losses.Dishonest treasurers admitted to 7% of the incidents but walked awaywith only 6% of the fraud-related losses in their pockets.     Although the percentage of fraud being committed atthe executive level may appear small (9% of some 350 cases handled bythe FBI last year), the culprits accounted for 20% of the totallosses.     Half of the fraud reported in California wasdiscovered by accidentthrough called-in tips, for exampleaccording toDeMaria. Only 19% was uncovered by internal auditors, whilemanagement controls snared only 10% of the perpetrators.     DeMaria cites three reasons people commit fraud:situational pressure, opportunities that create an environment forfraud and personal characteristics that may drive a person to commitfraud.     Situational pressure could push somebody to embezzleagainst or in behalf of a company, for example, falsely boosting acompanys revenues to impress stockholders and artificially inflatestock prices, he says. We have several pending investigations in thatarea.     Other reasons include high personal debt, financialloss, inadequate income, extravagant lifestyle, excessive gambling,job frustration or inequity whether imagined or real and undue familyor community expectations.     However, weak or dishonest management, or simply onecorporate manager calling the shots, also ranks as one of the majorcauses of institutional fraud, DeMaria notes.     In one case, DeMaria and his team arrested a 54-year-old accountant for embezzling some $3.2 million from the bank whereshe worked. During that time, the bank was under investigation by theFBI for certain questionable deals that put it on the brink offailure. Despite the presence of the agents, the accountant continuedto carry out her scam under their noses for nine months until herarrest.     Asked why she did it, she replied, For years, I havewatched (the owner) and his cronies go into his little office tofigure out how to plunder this institution. Very simply, I decided toget my share before this thing collapsed.     Like any good accountant, she kept records of everyillegal transaction management ever made. Her books led to the arrestand conviction of 18 top management officials. For cooperating withauthorities, her jail time was reduced to 67 days.     Some embezzlers do it for bizarre reasons, too. Oneaccountant was arrested by the FBI for embezzling $4,312.16. Puzzledby the exactness of the amount, DeMaria asked the felon why he tookthat specific amount.     Attending conferences and speaking to colleagues whowere employed in companies similar to mine, I found out I was beingunderpaid, he said. So I netted it all out and figured how much thecompany owed me. Thats how much I took.     Insiders who commit fraud are mostly first-timeoffenders, 90% of whom are motivated by greed, says DeMaria.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISIONCore Capital to Total Adjusted Assets Ratio (or leverage ratio).

First of twoexcerpts.     The IRS has taken the position in the proposedregulations that the large bank reserve recapture timing rules of the1986 Tax Reform Act apply to some large banks, but not to all largebanks. Large banks that were formerly thrifts are not eligible, inthe IRS view.     As many others commentators have noted, this positiondirectly contradicts the position previously taken by the TreasuryDepartment in public testimony to the Congress on Oct. 26, 1989, andalso directly contradicts the interpretation given in the JointCommittees General Explanation of the 1986 act.     There is nothing wrong, of course, in a governmentagency changing its position when it discovers that it has made amistake in interpreting the law.     Where there is such a complete change from aconsistently held position, the IRS would appear to owe the public aconvincing explanation of the statutory basis for its change inposition. These regulations purport to interpret a statute. They arenot legislative regulations.     The preamble skips over problems of statutorylanguage and construction, and goes directly to the IRS policyconcerns.     Policy concerns alone, no matter how valid, areirrelevant to the issue of statutory interpretation unless theService can first articulate a convincing case that the statuteitself is ambiguous. This has not yet been attempted.     Even if ambiguity were subsequently demonstrated, theServices stated policy concerns would not support its proposedstatutory interpretation. In addition, the IRS can actually addressits stated policy concerns much more effectively than the wayoutlined in the proposed regulations.     The core policy issue in this area seem to be Section593(e).     Under that provision, thrifts are subject to partialrecapture to the extent they distribute untaxed earnings accumulatedin their reserve balances.     Once a large thrift becomes a large bankand beginsrecapturing all of its reserves over a multi-year periodit isapparently no longer subject to the partial recapture rules ofSection 593(e).     The IRS does not like this result, and apparentlywould have preferred that Congress maintain a continuing role forSection 593(e).     This policy argument is historically quite relevantto the issue of congressional intent, since one of the options beforethe Congress in 1985 was an approach to recapture that would havesimilarly stressed the policy concerns underlying Section 593(e).   The Joint Committee staff recommended an option underwhich thrifts changing to the specific charge-off method wouldautomatically recapture only the bank portion of their reserves,while the remainder would be subject to the continued application ofSection 593(e).     The IRS apparently would have preferred thisapproachsince it would have treated the bank portion the same waybank reserves are treatedand it would treat the thrift or subsidyportion in the way thrifts reasonably expected those reserves wouldalways be treatedi.e., recaptured if, and only if, they liquidated orattempted to distribute untaxed amounts in their reserves toshareholders.     There is much to be said for this approach as apolicy matter. I suspect that many in the thrift industry might agreethat it would have been wiser had the Congress adopted this JointCommittee approach to the timing of recapture, rather than theelective cut-off method.     But the IRS is purporting to make a statutoryconstruction argument, not a pure policy argument. In that regard,there is a world of difference between Congress making an unwisepolicy decision, and making an unreasonable or insupportable policydecision.     It is not enough for the IRS to say, or even prove,that choosing the cut-off method, over the Joint Committee option,would have been unwise.     To make its statutory argument, the IRS must argue,and must demonstrate, that it would have been so insupportable orunreasonable that no one can rationally conclude that Congress couldhave made that choice.Back to Headline List WT03-B39-22IA060-000326-B015-417http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi74.html 205.156.212.5 19970115013253 text/html 37470HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:31:02 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:21 GMTContent-length: 37281Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi74.html Sample Issue Copyright THRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNet June 22, 1992 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES STATE BANK INVESTMENT LIMITS CALLED INCONSISTENT WITH LAW (469 words) ADC LOANS FOR HOUSING ARE NOW REGARDED AS THRIFT INVESTMENTS UNDER THE QTL TEST (768 words) OTS, CBO DISAGREE STRONGLY ON THE INDUSTRYS CONDITION 700 More S&Ls At Risk?

Paul Schosberg, president of the Savings & CommunityBankers of America, contends that the FDIC proposal takes a muchnarrower view of those powers than Congress intended when it enactedthem in  the 1991 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ImprovementAct.     The FDIC interpretation, which the FDIC says wouldput state banks insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund ona par with those insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, unjustlyrestricts the amount a savings bank can invest in equities and mutualfunds, Schosberg maintains. He is urging the FDIC to reconsider.     In an amendment to the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation Act, the FDICIA generally limits the activities andequity investments of a all state-chartered banks insured by the SAIFand the BIF to those permissible for national banks.     The dispute between the FDIC and the industry centersaround the agencys interpretation of a grandfather clause in theprovision, which became effective last Dec. 19.     Specifically, the provision creates a limitedgrandfather for investments in common or preferred stock or shares ofinvestment companies.     This grandfather exception pertains to savings bankslocated in states that, as of Sept. 30, 1991, permitted them toinvest in such stock listed on a national securities exchange or inshares of an investment company registered under the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940. These banks must have made or maintainedinvestments in listed stock and registered shares during the periodfrom Sept. 30, 1990, to Nov. 26, 1991 (the window period).     Under the FDICIA amendment, those institutions couldacquire or retain, with FDIC approval, listed stock or registeredshares to the same extent that they did during the above period, upto 100% of their capital.     But Schosberg claims the FDIC is ignoring the spiritand letter of the provision in its proposed rule. He argues that theproposal defines equity security authority using restrictions that gofar beyond the discussions that led up to the FDICIA and far beyondits language.     The proposal divides equity powers into two groups:mutual fund holdings and holdings of common and preferred stock.     Under the proposed rule, an institution that hadmutual fund and equity holdings during the window period couldcontinue to invest in the holdings, but only up to the highest levelinvested during that period. The total of all such investments couldnot exceed 100% of capital.     We will suggest that the FDIC return to what webelieve was the intent of Congress, Schosberg says. State banksholding either mutual funds or stocks during the window period shouldbe permitted to invest in either type of security in the future, upto 100% of capital.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNetJune 22, 1992ADC LOANS FOR HOUSING ARE NOW REGARDED AS THRIFT INVESTMENTS UNDERTHE QTL TESTIn an effort to help ease the nations credit crunchand stimulate the housing market, the Office of Thrift Supervision isnow permitting some acquisition, development and construction (ADC)loans to be treated as qualified investments under the qualifiedthrift lender (QTL) test.     To be eligible, the ADC transactions must involveresidential housing projects and bear little risk, according to newThrift Bulletin 20-2, which also offers guidance on QTL testrequirements regarding starter homes and credit-needy areas.     ADC loans for development of commercial structureswill continue to be ineligible for qualified thrift investment (QTI)status.     OTS move is consistent with a Bush administrationdirective asking regulators to moderate tough regulatory requirementsthat discourage insured lenders from making real estate-relatedloans, as long as the action does not pose a threat to the safety andsoundness of the institutions involved.     ADC transactions received a bad reputation during the1980s when government studies implicated them in the savings and loanindustry debacle. As a result, Congress and federal regulatorsimposed restrictions on such transactions, most of which wereconsidered high-risk.     For an ADC transaction to qualify as an investmentunder the QTL test, it must meet the following criteria:      Both stages of an acquisition and development loanmust be funded in a single combination. The financing must be a loan,not an investment.      The S&L involved must demonstrate that the propertyis reasonably certain to be developed as domestic residentialhousing;      The property must be zoned exclusively forresidential use;      The property must be zoned to permit residentialuse, and the deed must have legally enforceable covenants thatrestrict its use to sites for structures designed primarily forhomes; or      The property must be zoned to allow residential use,and the borrower must certify that he or she intends to constructdwelling structures immediately on almost all of the property.     S&Ls must have at least 65% of their assets inhousing and housing-related assets in order to pass the QTL test. Ifthey fail it, they could be compelled to convert to commercial bankcharters.     QTL test provisions allow thrifts to include in theirqualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loans andinvestments used to buy, build or develop starter homes or starterhome developments.     To be classified as a starter home loan for QTL testpurposes, TB 20-2 says, a loan must be:      Secured by a one-to-four family home, condominium orcooperative, or by a development where 75% or more of thedevelopments value consists of such homes;      Located in the associations Community ReinvestmentAct community; and      Valued when the loan is made at an appraised valueof 60% or less than the median value of newly constructed one-to-fourfamily homes in the thrifts CRA community.     If no median value figures are available for theassociations CRA community, OTS explains, the institution mayestimate the value by relying on data provided by the Federal HousingFinance Board, the National Association of Home Builders or privatefirms.     Federal laws and rules also let thrifts include intheir qualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loansmade to small businesses or for construction, development orimprovement of residential housing or community service facilitieswithin credit-needy areas.     The term credit-needy area includes areas within thethrifts delineated CRA community that meet one or more of thesecriteria:      Census tracts, counties or areas in a MetropolitanStatistical Area with median household income that is 80% or less ofthe MSA median.      Census tracts where loans by all institutions, asreported by the most recent available Home Mortgage Disclosure Actdata, total 50% or less of the average loan volume for all censustracts in the MSA, and the median household income is 120% of the MSAmedian.      Areas that have been designated as credit-needy byfederal, state or local government and that receive some form ofcredit-related targeted assistance from such governments.     If none of the above data are available for theassociations community, credit-needy areas may be identified afterconsultation with local government and community representatives, TB20-2 says.      In addition, it says, if the loan is for a smallbusiness or a community service facility,  it may be classified asbeing for a credit-needy area for QTL purposes if it is made to asmall firm owned by a person whose home address is within the credit-needy area, or if it is made to a community service facility thatprimarily serves people whose homes are in the credit-needy area.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNetJune 22, 1992OTS, CBO DISAGREE STRONGLY ON THE INDUSTRYS CONDITION700 More S&Ls At Risk?Bob DukeAre the shadows of misfortune that have stalked thesavings and loan industry for more than a decade fading or growinglarger and darker?     Like beauty, the answer lies in the eyes of thebeholder. This was evident last week when a favorable report on theindustrys condition issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision wasshot down by Robert D. Reischauer, director of the CongressionalBudget Office.     Although the industrys net income for the firstquarter of this year totaled $1.6 billion, a figure nearly equal tothat for all of 1991, Reischauer contended that the industrys futureremains bleak.     He told the Senate Banking Committee that anadditional 500 to 700 savings institutions might fail during the nextthree years, substantially boosting the cost of the taxpayer-financedindustry cleanup.     Reischauer said the only reason that the industryscondition seems  good now is that so many insolvent and troubledinstitutions have been removed from the scenario.     The cost of this effort has been high, and thecleanup of the thrift crisis is not over, he stated.     Reischauers comments chilled the festive atmospherethat had prevailed earlier when OTS Director Timothy Ryan announcedat a briefing that the industrys strong first quarter earnings thisyear, coupled with its solid performance last year, stronglyindicated that the industry was becoming capable of sustainedprofitability and stability.     Ryan emphasized, too, that the industrys capitalposition had improved greatly over the past two years.     Furthermore, he pointed out that the 1992 first-quarter profitmarked the fifth consecutive quarter that the industryhad been profitable. In addition, he said, this was the first timesince 1986 that quarterly net income had exceeded $1.5 billion.     Later, in testimony before the Senate BankingCommittee, Ryan declared that the end of the industry cleanup was insight.     We have closed over 700 failed thrifts with nearly$360 billion in assets since the Financial Institutions Reform,Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 became law, Ryan said. Allcritically undercapitalized institutions that we have identified asbeing nonviable should be resolved, or have active resolutionstrategies in place, this year, if the Resolution Trust Corporationis granted funding and the current real estate markets do not worsen.     Ryan said only 37 nonviable institutions remainunresolved.     Reischauer sees the situation differently, arguingthat when the cleanup is finally over, it will have cost the public$215 billion (in 1990 dollars), and fewer than 1,400 thrifts willremain on the financial services industry landscape. At present,there are 2,064 S&Ls in the private sector, compared with 2,096 atthe end of last year and 4,000 in 1980.     If 500 to 700 more savings institutions go under, asReischauer believes, then there will almost certainly be a merger ofOTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Ryanadvocates such a consolidation,  and there is considerablecongressional sentiment favoring it. Proponents argue that there isno logical reason for the perpetuation of a costly federal agency toregulate a shrinking industry.     Whatever the case, OTS-OCC merger legislation is sureto be introduced  in Congress next year by House Banking CommitteeChairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, or some other member of hispanel.     Meanwhile, in his congressional testimony, Reischauerwarned that if the Resolution Trust Corporation stops acceptinginstitutions for resolution by October 1993, as scheduled, andtransfers the remaining case load to the FDIC-administered SavingsAssociation Insurance Fund, the fund will be unable to handle thetask without additional federal resources.     This situation has been worsened by the failure ofthe administration and the Congress to agree on continued funding forthe RTC, and the premature setback of RTC resolution operationsbefore completing its task, he said.     While Reischauer concedes that industry profits haveimproved, he thinks the situation could change quickly if the presentfavorable interest-rate environment took a negative turn.     But Ryan maintained that capital was the best measureof the thrift industrys safety, since it provides a buffer betweenthe institution and the SAIF, and between it and American taxpayers.     Today, the industrys tangible capital is over 5% oftotal assets, Ryan told the Senate Banking Committee. In the secondquarter of 1989, the industry reported tangible capital of only 3%.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNetJune 22, 1992REVISED FEE SCHEDULEThe following list illustrates the reduction ofapplication fees now applicable to well-capitalized thrifts under OTSexpedited processing program:     Expedited interstate and intrastate branch filings:$650; standard applications submitted by undercapitalizedinstitutions: $1,900.

Thisproposal would allow purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) andpurchased credit card relationships (PCCRs) to be defined asqualifying intangible assets, and therefore includable in corecapital (the leverage ratio). Singly, PMSRs could count up to 50% ofcore capital, while PCCRs could be includable as only up to 25% ofthe leverage ratio.

This authority is outlined in two interpretive letters issued bythe OCC Office of Chief Counsel.     Robert B. Serino, OCC deputy chief counsel, says Section 704 ofthe 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Actclearly authorizes national banks to join the FHLBank System and to ownstock in it if they meet the stipulated housing and safety and soundnessrequirements.     The section repealed a provision in the Federal HomeLoan Bank Act that expressly barred national banks from becomingmembers and stockholders in an FHLBank, he says.     Serino cautions that if a national bank decides toapply for FHLBank System membership, it should make sure it complieswith the OCCs general rules relating to prudence and appropriatebanking practices.     For example, he says, if a national bank ownedFHLBank stock exceeding the amount required by federal law for systemmembers, it could create concern at the OCC.     Serinos interpretive letter is expected to eliminateany lingering doubts by national banks as to their authority to jointhe FHLBank System as members and shareholders. Some national bankshave been reluctant to seek system membership because of thosedoubts, the OCC says.     Serino notes that the FIRREA conference reportemphasizes that Section 704s purpose is to expand system membershipto include commercial banks and credit unions that engage in mortgagelending.     The report says a bank or credit union would qualifyfor system membership if its financial condition were sound and itsmanagement and home-financing policy consistent with sound economicfinancing.     This expansion of Federal Home Loan Bank membership is intendedto promote and sustain housing finance and the Banks, the reportcontinues. The [Joint Conference] Committee believes that theextension of membership to insured commercial banks and credit unionsthat engage in mortgage lending will strengthen the Banks and theirability to support the mortgage market.     Serino stresses that the OCC neither encourages nordiscourages national bank membership and investment in the FHLBanks.Such decisions, he points out, are the responsibility of the nationalbanks management and boards of directors.     Meanwhile, in regard to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation(Freddie Mac) preferred stock, OCC Chief Counsel WilliamP. Bowden Jr. says in an interpretive letter that it is permissiblefor national banks to purchase the stock as long as they observe safeand sound banking practices and proper accounting in undertaking thetransactions.     While the statutes permit unlimited investment, as with any equityissue, there are market risks, and share prices may decline due tochanges in market interest rates, the issuers financial standing orgovernment tax policies, Bowden warns. Therefore, the OCC believes thatprudential limits of this sort typically are an element of safe and soundbanking practice.     The chief counsel says Freddie Mac plans to issue itspreferred stock under Section 306(f) of the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation Act, with the stock carrying an investment graderating from a national rating agency.     Congress, Bowden explains, has exempted Freddie Macinstruments of that type from the statutory underwriting and stockinvestment restrictions normally imposed on national banks.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNetJune 22, 1992APPLICATION FEES ASSESSED HEALTHY INSTITUTIONS WILL DECREASE UNDEROTS MODIFIED SCHEDULEBeginning June 30, processing fees assessed healthy savings and loanassociations in connection with certain significant applications willbe considerably lower.     For other thrifts, the Office of Thrift Supervisionfees essentially will remain as they are under the present scheduleapplicable to all institutions.     Healthy institutions are eligible for lower application fees underan expedited processing program authorized by the OTS new applicationsregulation.     To qualify for the expedited program, a thrift mustmeet or exceed its minimum regulatory capital standards and havecomposite MACRO examination ratings of one or two, as well as havesatisfactory regulatory compliance ratings.     The revised fee structure for applications isoutlined in new Thrift Bulletin 48-8.     Although healthy institution managers are delightedwith the modified fee formula, managers for undercapitalized onesnaturally are upset at the change.     Harold L. Levi, a former Federal Home Loan Bank Boardattorney who represents several undercapitalized institutions,contends that the new formula is unfair and that lower fees forcertain applications should be  determined on a case-by-case basis.     Levi, managing partner in Harold L. Levi Associatesin Washington, says the formula is inconsistent with OTS generalpolicy of adopting rules applying to the industry as a whole.     In any event, classification as being healthy willmean much lower applications processing fees in some instances.     For example, expedited interstate and intrastatebranch applications will cost $650 for healthy institutions, comparedwith $1,900 for standard or unexpedited applications. For anexpedited change-of-location application, the fee will be $250,compared with $900 for a standard application.     While undercapitalized institutions will have to pay$1,400 for bylaw amendment applications, healthy institutions wonthave to pay anything, since their submissions will be regarded byauthorities as preapproved.     Well-capitalized thrifts wont be assessed any processing fee forcharter amendment applications, but undercapitalized ones will have topay $1,400.     Ailing S&Ls will have to pay $5,300 for applicationsinvolving the inclusion of subordinated debt and mandatorilyredeemable preferred stock in capital. In contrast, healthyinstitutions will be assessed only $1,700.     For a finance subsidiary application, the processingfee will be $6,650 for a standard one and $2,000 for an expeditedfiling. An application for an exemption from the loans-to-one-borrower requirements will cost a healthy S&L $825, compared with$2,500 for an undercapitalized one.     For other applications, the present fee schedule generally willprevail for all savings associations.     Because the new applications restructuring regulationwill replace certain applications with simple notices, OTS expectsthe time and cost associated with processing such transactions todecrease.     Accordingly, the fees relating to transactions andactivities that formerly required applications have been reduced, TB48-8 says. The new fees are based on the existing fees imposed onapplications estimated to have similar processing times.     The bulletin notes that the assessment schedule nolonger contains fees for applications for agency offices, temporarychanges of location, investments in office buildings, brokereddeposits, liquidity penalty and affiliated transactions.

The new parallel-processing supercomputer, whichwas unveiled at the World Trade Center on Jan. 8, utilizes up to128 of Intel's high-performance, 64-bit i860 microprocessors andcan deliver up to 7.6 billion floating point operations persecond (GFlops).  About a dozen of Pru-Bache's 400 traders and salesmen currentlyhave access to applications running on an iPSC/2, a precursor ofthe new iPSC/860. "Over the next six to 12 months, allparallelizable, cpu-consumptive applications will beparallelized, and a large number of our traders and salesmen willbe using them," says Vincent Pica, managing director of Pru-Bache's financial strategies group.  The IPSC/2, an 80386-based supercomputer, was installed at theinvestment firm's New York office in mid-1989. In April, theIPSC/2 will be upgraded to performance levels of the newiPSC/860. The upgrade will result in a iPSC/2-860 hybrid, onethat uses eight i860s and 24 386 chips.  In parallel processing computers, problems are divided intomany parts and executed simultaneously, resulting in executiontimes that far surpass serial or batch processing methods.  Pru-Bache claims it is the first securities firm to use the newgeneration of supercomputers from Intel. The new machines are thefirst commercial products resulting from the joint Intel-DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) Touchstone project.Seeking to set new standards for supercomputer performance,Touchstone hopes to develop a 2000 processor, 150-GFlop machineby 1992.  The air-cooled iPSC/860 machine, with anywhere from eight to128 microprocessors, ranges in price from $265,000 to $3.5million. Intel claims that the new machine out-price-performs acomparable Y-MP supercomputer from Cray Research Inc. by a factorof 10.  Pru-Bache has been using the iPSC/2 machine as a server on itsethernet network which also links IBM mainframes, DigitalEquipment Corp. VAX minicomputers and Sun Microsystems Inc.workstations. The initial applications fitted to thesupercomputer have been geared toward the firm's mortgage-backedsecurities trading business, but future developments will addressgovernment and corporate bond analysis needs.  Current applications running on the iPSC/2 include the creationof collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and predictiveperformance analysis. "There is an evolving need on the part ofsophisticated clients to know how these securities will act overa wider range of interest-rate scenarios, requiring more firepower," says Pica. Last year Pru-Bache created over $13 billionworth of "engineered" securities, he says.  The high-speed capability of the Intel machine has promptedPru-Bache to take on more arcane and computationally intensivefunctions, such as the tax arbitrage associated with CMOresiduals. "Without the arbitrage values, while [an issue] mayhave a high yield before tax, it may have a very low yield aftertax," Pica says.  After-tax residual calculations that once took 20 minutes toexecute on the firm's DEC VAX now take 90 seconds on the InteliPSC/2. And converting the residual program to run in thesupercomputer's parallel processing environment required only 40lines of code.  The supercomputer is also being used to speed programs used inthe analysis of adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. Allthe required software conversion -- including the development ofparallel scheduling algorithms that allow multiple users tointeract with the iPSC/2 simultaneously -- has been performedcollectively by Pru-Bache and Intel.  Along with its low price, Intel hopes to win customers bycovering all the compatibility bases. The iPSC/860 purportedlycan be linked to DEC VAX, IBM and/or UNIX-based environments.TCP/IP and ethernet standards are also supported. The iPSC/860 isavailable with up to 2 gigabytes of RAM. Disk storage in excessof 100 gigabytes can be linked to the machine.  "With any parallel computer that's new, regardless of who thevendor is, you have the potential of being left high and dry withthe technology," says William Anderson, executive vice presidentof information systems at Pru-Bache. He adds: "With Intel, atleast from a chip point of view, they control the chip that makesit all happen. "  "We were familiar with [Intel's] management through previousassociations," adds Pica. "We were impressed by their involvementwith DARPA...and Intel had a natural advantage being themanufacturer of the both the 386 and 860 chip."Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990REUTERS TRADING SYSTEMS EXECDEPARTS AFTER TRIARCH FIASCO  Reuters Holdings PLC and Mario Rosi, its global product groupleader for trading room systems, have gone their separate ways.The break comes in the wake of the recent collapse of Reuters'bid to install its TRIARCH 2000 digital data distribution systemat National Westminster Bank (TST, Oct. 9, 1989).  Rosi's departure was expected for some time -- the final strawbeing the Nat West fiasco, sources say. Revenues at Reuters' Richsubsidiary are said to have gone from about $150 million in 1987to $50 million in 1989. The 1989 total is said to includecontinuing service contract revenues of about $25 million, butnot PRISM revenue because it isn't a U.S.-developed product.  Rosi was replaced by David Morgan, formerly Reuters'international marketing manager for trading room systems andRosi's subordinate. Morgan could not be reached for comment.  Morgan's ascendance is said by insiders at Reuters to be a blowfor Rich president Peter Leger. Like Rosi, Morgan will be basedin London and report to David Ure, managing director of ReutersEurope, Middle East and Africa Ltd. As a product group leader,Morgan will also report to Andre Villeneuve, who chairsReuters'international product planning committee in addition tohis regional management responsibilities.  Sources say part of the reason Leger was passed over was thatUre wasn't willing to let North American management gain controlof another product group. John Hull is product group leader fortransactional services, and Buford Smith is product group leaderfor real time information.                       An Amicable Parting  A spokesman in Reuters' London office stated last week thatRosi "had resigned, effective immediately, for personal reasons."Sources at Reuters say the senior executive was offered theposition of director of operations in Italy, an offer he flatlyrefused.  Reached by phone at his London home, Rosi corroborated Reuters'statement, saying that circumstances surrounding his departurewere "totally" amicable. Asked if the failure of Triarch 2000 inany way contributed to his motives for leaving, he said "not atall....I decided the time was right to take on something new,different and more challenging." Rosi says he is looking into"several options" for employment in the industry, including"setting up my own company."  Though Reuters would not elaborate on the details of Rosi'sdeparture, his Reuters stock holdings are likely to have beenconsiderable. Executives were given shares of Reuters stockbefore the company went public; stock options have subsequentlybeen offered over the past few years. Rosi had been with Reutersfor 16 years.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990SEC SAYS RMJ'S OPTIONSSYSTEM IS NO EXCHANGE  The Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that RMJ'sOver-the-Counter Options Trading System is not an exchange andthat Delta Government Options Corp., the system's clearingagency, can operate as such.  Last summer, the commission was ordered to define an exchangeby a Chicago federal appeals court which heard a case the Chicagofutures exchanges brought against the SEC (TST, Sept. 11, 1989).The court opinion was a key event in the futures exchanges'sustained legal campaign against the RMJ system, which theyviewed as a competitive market.  A spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange says theexchange "will review the SEC rule and consult with the ChicagoBoard of Trade on future action we would take, if any." A CBOTofficial says the exchange won't decide what to do until the SECissues an official order, expected this week.  The uninterrupted operation of RMJ's system hinged on thecommission's ruling. Had the commission ruled that the system wasan exchange subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,operation of RMJ and Delta might have been temporarily stoppedwhile appropriate registration was sought.  The ruling also paves the way for action on the SEC's proposedrule on proprietary trading systems (TST, Aug. 14, 1989), whichthe commission had shelved while pondering the RMJ case. Thedecision is likely to help sponsors of proprietary systemsunderstand what innovations they can and can't make.  TST learned about key points discussed at the commissionhearing, held on Jan. 5, although SEC officials won't discusswhat was said until the commission issues an official order. TheChicago court order requires the commission to issue its order byJan. 18, SEC officials say.  The key to the SEC's decision is that RMJ's system functions asa so-called billboard without intermediary market makers whocontinuously make a two-sided market, according to StephenLynner, president of RMJ Options Trading Corp., who attended thecommission hearing. Says Lynner: "In the SEC's mind, what mostclearly delineates an exchange in the rules and proceduresimposed by its sponsors is a requirement that a subgroup ofparticipants in the system make bids and offers on the securitiesin the system on a continuous basis. We don't have anything inour procedures that requires anybody to do that."  Instead, RMJ's billboard system "displays indications ofinterest of the price at which someone wants to buy or sell, butthere is no requirement that anybody put up an offer." Indeed,many days have gone by, especially since the Chicago court issuedits order last summer, when no participants have put up bids oroffers, Lynner says.  The RMJ system advertises indications of interest to buy orsell, but executions are done by telephone. In the RMJ system, apotential buyer calls an RMJ broker to enter a bid into thesystem, which other system participants will see on dumbterminals. A potential seller calls the broker to indicate hisinterest. By phone, the broker confirms the deal with bothparties and consummates the transaction with a keystroke.                       What's an Exchange?  During the commission hearing, which lasted over an hour, staffin the SEC's division of market regulation presented arguments tothe commissioners about what constitutes an exchange, accordingto Lynner. He says that among the features the staff saiddistinguish RMJ's system from an exchange are the following: theabsence of a physical trading floor; no concept of members whobuy a seat; and the idea that the system's sponsor selects whatsecurities will be traded.  But, says Lynner, the staff indicated that even "the presenceof any of those things with a billboard doesn't turn the systeminto an exchange." Rather, he says, the SEC staff suggested that"the expectation of a two-sided market may draw the system intomore of an exchange than a billboard."  Last summer's Chicago court order created a "dearth ofinterest" from the 23 participants in RMJ's market, Lynner says.Now that the SEC has ruled in RMJ's favor, Lynner expectstransaction volume to pick up shortly. He says the system'sscreens are already "filling up with bids and offers," thatspreads are tighter and that in general "people are spending moretime with the system."Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990KAPITI AND AREGON JOIN FORCESIN MOVE SEEN AS CONSOLIDATION  U.K. financial software firms Aregon International Ltd. andKapiti Ltd. have merged in what appears to be a shotgun weddingarranged by venture capital companies Advent Ltd. and ElectraInvestment Trust, which have stakes in both companies.  The combined company will operate under Kapiti's name. BarryRoberts, Aregon's managing director, becomes executive chairmanof the combined company. Dick Willott remains as Kapiti'smanaging director. Sources say Aregon has been up for sale forsome time.  Kapiti and Aregon have not crossed paths before at clientinstallations, despite Kapiti's customer list of 500 institutionsworldwide. Previous cooperative ventures thus didn't play a rolein bringing the two parties together.  Sources at the newly combined company attribute the move toproduct synergies. But sources say it's more likely thatinvestors Advent and Electra saw the merger as a means ofmaintaining product lines while reducing costs.  The move makes sense for Kapiti, which last year launched afront-office deal-capture module to its Equation back-officepackage. Customers balked at the module's primitive functionalityand high price, sources say. Aregon's FIST, a digital feedhandler and development toolkit, and its new TS-STAR decisionsupport software could enhance Kapiti's credibility in the frontoffice.                     Picture of Aregon Gray  But for Aregon, the picture is different. Aregon has been goingthrough a bad patch lately, sources say, although the emergenceof TS-STAR has sparked some market interest. Some of thecompany's problems are said to spring from its relationship withDEC.  Aregon, which has traditionally based its products on theVAX/VMS platform, has looked to DEC and in particular thecompany's DECtrade initiative as a vehicle to carry it into themarket for large trading-room systems.  DEC, however, recently acquired the PriceWatch package fromSecurity Pacific Corp.'s Sequor Group subsidiary. Both FIST andPriceWatch perform a similar function within DECtrade; they bothmanage incoming data feeds and deliver real-time market data touser positions. DEC's purchase of PriceWatch suggests it will befavored by DEC over FIST. Observers say Aregon regarded itsinvolvement in DECtrade as "vital" to the company's future.  Aregon has attempted to widen its possible market through amarketing agreement with IBM (TST, Feb. 27, 1989). But thataccord has yet to bear fruit.  The new Kapiti will post 1989 sales of more than 21 millionpounds sterling and pretax profit of 3.5 million pounds sterling.The company's products will include Aregon's FIST and TS-STARpackages and Kapiti's Equation. The complementarity of theproducts, according to Jeremy Wood, executive director at Aregon,is "obvious."  Aregon says the merger gives it access to an internationalsales and marketing infrastructure that will improve distributionchannels for its products. Aregon's two offices, in London andNew York, will be merged with those of Kapiti. Kapiti, a supplierof back-office processing software primarily to foreign branchesof major banks, will gain access to Aregon's client list of morethan 20 trading institutions.                     It Couldn't Not Happen  Aregon's products cater to the front-office tradingenvironment. FIST is a digital feed handler that features anapplications development toolkit. U.S.-based users of the systeminclude J.P. Morgan & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Bankers TrustCo. and Citicorp, Wood says. TS-STAR is a recently launchedanalytics package that delivers easy-to-digest graphicalrepresentations of financial data relationships (TST, Nov. 6,1989).  Kapiti's Equation is a back-office processing system thatcovers all functions of a bank's international department orforeign branch office, including money markets and capitalmarkets trade processing. According to Peter Nizich, senior vicepresident at Kapiti Inc. in New York, Equation "serves as themainframe for the branch office." The package runs on an IBMAS/400 computer with user access via IBM PCs on a local areanetwork. Users in the U.S. include First Interstate Bank andNational Australia Bank.  Both Wood and Nizich agree that the merger is almost certain toresult in the development of a front-to-back-office package. "Icouldn't see how it couldn't," says Wood. Nizich is certain aninterface between FIST and Equation is technologically possibleand will be forthcoming.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TGB SEEKS CAPITAL AFTERASSETRONICS DEAL COLLAPSES  The purported acquisition of interdealer bond broker TGB Corp.by Assetronics is off, according to Henry Wattson, head of TGB.The deal was to have given Assetronics a 20% interest in thebrokerage innovator. TGB's regulatory capital has dipped belowrequisite levels, resulting in a suspension of trading.  Reported in the trade press as a fait accompli, the acquisitionfailed because Assetronics and its founder Jerry Kaplan renegedon their buyout intentions, according to Wattson. Commenting onthe reasons behind the aborted acquisition, Wattson saysAssetronics' Kaplan "got cold feet."  A letter of intent had been signed by Assetronics, according toa source close to the deal, stating that the companies wouldeffectively combine their resources. The agreement was terminatedwhen "contingent conditions in the letter were not met", thesource says.  Founded in 1988, TGB hoped to gain market share by slashingcommissions and using technology to redefine the broker-traderrelationship (TST, July 5, 1988). TGB brokers enter orders intoan automatic order matching system, rather than executing tradesby voice. TGB was partially capitalized by primary dealers andplanned to generate income by selling transaction information.  Assetronics has no business or holdings except cash, and islooking for acquisitions and/or mergers, a source says.  With Wattson's proven track record in interdealer bondbrokerage, TGB was widely regarded as a company to watch.Although TGB still is planning for the future, it is now mired infinancial troubles. "As of yesterday we were $40,000 under-capitalized," Wattson said last week. "We ran out of regulatorycapital."  "What we're trying to do right now is refinance," Wattson says."TGB is close to finalizing a deal with another source ofcapital....we've got other irons in the fire." Details were notavailable. Until it comes up with the requisite funds, TGB is notpermitted to function as an interdealer broker for any securitiestransactions.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990CBOE-AMEX STUDY REJECTSPHLX-PSE-NYSE FINDINGS  A new study on multiple listing of options strongly opposes therecommendations of an earlier study sponsored by the Pacific,Philadelphia and New York stock exchanges' task force. The study,commissioned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and theAmerican Stock Exchange, rejects the earlier study's proposedOptions Market Integration System (OMINTS) (TST, Oct. 23, 1989)for multiple trading of options.  The exchanges' lack of cooperation has prompted RichardBreeden, chairman of the SEC, to force them to the negotiatingtable.  In a letter to exchange officials this week, Breeden hasamended the planned rule change set to take place on Jan. 22(TST, June 5, 1989). The lottery system for newly-traded issueswill be phased out as planned, but Breeden has decided to extendthe ban on multiple listing of existing issues until the fiveexchanges sit down and discuss a plan for linking the exchanges.  The CBOE-AMEX study says OMINTS, a proposed intermarket order-routing system similar to the Intermarket Trading System (ITS)that has linked U.S. stock exchanges since 1978, is redundant,outdated and would not serve the best interests of investors.  The CBOE and AMEX are the largest U.S. options exchanges interms of trading volume, with 44% and 30% of the marketrespectively. Philadelphia has 13%, the Pacific exchange 11% andthe NYSE a 2% share.                       Staying Competitive  While Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia StockExchange defends OMINTS as "a logical first step," the authors ofthe CBOE-AMEX study say the system would "lock the market into anold concept that will significantly impair the ability to developnew and more advanced solutions later."  The new study questions the OMINTS feature which allowsspecialists to choose between meeting the best inter-exchange bidor offer, and thereby executing the order, and re-routing acustomer order. The study says this reduces the immediacy ofexecution, and that the broker initiating the trade from hisoffice should decide the final destination of a customer order.  This, the authors believe, will compel each market maker tomaintain a competitive bid or offer, and thus help to keep themarkets competitive and allow the investor to execute quickly andcost-effectively. Both studies claim to propose measures thatwill prevent market fragmentation -- the task forces's byimplementing an integrated order-routing system and the CBOE-AMEX's by preserving competition.  The new study, jointly authored by Yakov Amihud, professor offinance at New York University's Stern School of Business andHaim Mendelson, professor of decision sciences and informationsystems at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, wasprepared in response to the SEC's white paper calling forcomments on multiple listing of options. The Pacific-Philadelphia-New York study was executed by Tellefsen ConsultingGroup Inc.                         Looking Forward  In keeping with the CBOE and AMEX's desire to take a moreforward-looking approach, the professors have released only aninterim study. They will not release their final recommendationsfor a market integration system until after multiple tradingcommences, allowing the impact of multiple listing to beassessed.  In a letter to Chairman Breeden, Nicholas Giordano, presidentof the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, says the CBOE-AMEX studyoffers no "concrete alternatives to or legitimate criticisms ofOMINTS" and therefore the members of the task force are convincedOMINTS is the best alternative.  Although the exchanges continue to argue over how to integratethe options markets, they all consider development of new pricingsystems for their specialists a top priority.  Options specialists at the AMEX have started using The OptionsPricing System (TOPS), a computerized options pricing model thatupdates prices as the underlying stock prices change. TOPS wasjointly developed by the AMEX and David Bruce & Co., a Chicagofinancial software developer, and the Securities IndustryAutomation Corp.                        Faster is Better  Selected CBOE market makers have had an online analyticalsystem installed. PC Auto Quote uses different pricing models toquickly calculate option prices (TST, Oct. 23, 1989). The pilotsystem uses IBM PS/2 terminals with touch sensitive screens andhas been installed at three booths covering four equity optionsseries. The exchange's floor procedure committee approved theinstallation of the pilot as a test to see if online systems helpto increase order flow.  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is also developing an auto-quote system for options specialists. The auto-quote system hasbeen in use for a few years on the exchange's currency floor.Officials say the exchange hopes to have the entire options flooroperational by April. The auto-quote system updates optionsprices as the underlying security moves. The exchange is alsousing software developed by David Bruce, but because the softwarewill run on a high-powered workstation, exchange officials claimPhilly market makers can update prices six times faster thanusers of Amex's TOPS system.  The Pacific Stock Exchange will have an auto-quote system tiedto its online Pacific Options Exchange Trading System (POETS) toallow specialists to quickly update options prices.  The NYSE is in the process of installing an online automaticquote system for its specialists. The system will carry quotesfor all issues traded on the NYSE.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TELERATE PLANS BROKER VERSIONOF TTS TO RIVAL REUTERS SYSTEM  In response to Reuters Holdings PLC's planned launch of itsDealing 2000-2 foreign exchange order-matching system, TelerateInc. is developing a rival system that will preserve the role ofthe broker in the interbank market. Telerate has traditionallymaintained close relationships with brokers, particularly withCantor Fitzgerald & Co., which provides Telerate with U.S.government securities prices under an exclusive arrangement.  The proposed system will display executable, two-way pricescontributed by foreign exchange brokers. Subscribers toTelerate's Trading Service (TTS) will be able to view and hitfirm broker prices through their TTS slates instead of having totrade over the telephone. Telerate says it is talking to brokersabout participating in the system but has yet to conclude a firmagreement.  The system will use the same worldwide network Telerate builtto support TTS. Telerate says development of the system -- dubbedthe Broker Version -- is 85% completed. The only upgrade requiredto access the new system will be installation of a color versionof the monochrome TTS dealer slate. TTS is a conversationalinterbank trading service that competes with Reuters' MonitorDealing and Dealing 2000 systems.  Dealing 2000-2, which is slated for rollout before the thirdquarter of this year, will make Reuters the sole intermediary forits own screen-based market. The system is expected to take somebusiness away from the telephone-based forex broker market.  Telerate says its Broker Version will retain the existingbroker structure of the over-the-counter foreign exchange market.In that structure, banks telephone brokers to get two-way priceson any currency combination. The brokers match sellers andbuyers, taking a cut in the process.                      Black Boxes Premature  In more direct competition to Reuters' Dealing 2000-2 is RADAR,a black-box order-matching system under development by RADARFinancial L.P., a joint venture comprising MAI PLC, Euro BrokersInc. and a number of as yet undisclosed partners (TST, Oct. 23,1989). But according to Jim Wiseman, chief designer of TTS,Telerate doesn't believe the foreign exchange market is ready foran anonymous black-box trading system.  A TTS user would access the Broker Version by hitting a fieldon his slate marked with the letter B. This would change theformat of both the slate and the screen in front of the trader.The Broker Version slate shows the same function fields along thelower edge of the slate.  Above the function fields, the slate is divided horizontallyinto two segments. The lower segment contains the bank's ownrates for selected currency pairs. The upper segment shows thebest three broker bid and offer rates for the currency pair thetrader is dealing in. The bids and offers are arranged in apyramid formation, with the best bid and offer side by side atthe top-center of the slate.                          Hit the Field  To hit a broker at a particular bid or offer, the tradertouches the relevant field on his slate. At this point, thetransaction is immediately executed, with the systemautomatically exchanging settlement details between the twoparties. If the trader hit the best bid or offer on the slate,the previous second-best bid or offer moves to the top of thepyramid and the new third-best bid or offer joins the pyramid atthe bottom. If the trader hits the second- or third-best bid oroffer, the system automatically hits the best bid or offer at thesame time and calculates the average rate for the transaction.  At the center of the pyramid is a field that displays detailsof the most recent three transactions the trader has completedthat day. Included in the data are the identities of thecounterparties with which the deals were struck. The trader isable to scroll up and down in this field, giving him access totransactions made earlier in the day.  Meanwhile, a fifth quadrant superimposed onto the center of thetrader's screen displays the best three broker bids and offers inthe system, plus the bank's own rates. An incoming call from acounterparty on the TTS network would automatically takeprecedence on the screen over the broker quadrant.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990STRATUS TOUTS JAPANESEDEAL STRUCK LAST SPRING  Security must be pretty tight in Japan these days, becauseYamaichi Securities has only just allowed Stratus Computer Inc.to announce a $1.9 million deal the computer manufacturer strucklast spring with Toshiba Engineering Co. Two of the three XA2000s Yamaichi acquired in the deal have actually been up andrunning since last summer.  A Stratus Computer Inc. press release dated Jan. 2 and sent toTST offices via Federal Express, fax and ordinary mail boldlyclaims: "Stratus wins $1.9 million contract to supply YamaichiSecurities with online trading system."  The third Stratus XA 2000, which was also delivered lastsummer, will support a trading system to be developed by systemsintegrator Toshiba for Yamaichi. Stratus' contract is actuallywith the systems integrator, which is developing the futures andoptions trading system that will run on Stratus computers atYamaichi offices in Japan.                     Economic with the Facts  The release also says that "the Stratus-based system...isalready online," distributing "real-time futures and optionsprices listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to Sun Workstations" onYamaichi's trading floor and at branch offices.  A long discussion starting on page 2 of the press releasedescribes in detail what seems to be a ticker plant, not atrading system. There is no further mention of the futures andoptions trading system in development.  A little investigation helped sort out the situation. Yes,Stratus assures us, the release does describe a ticker plant thatuses Stratus technology, and that system has been in operationsince the summer. A Stratus XA 2000 model 120 receives theprices, and a model 110 distributes the data to brokerworkstations, Stratus says. Yamaichi wanted a second machine toperform the ticker plant function usually performed by onebecause the firm plans to run other, as yet undisclosedapplications on it, Stratus explains.  Now that the ticker plant is up and running, a trading systemis being developed, Stratus says. The third Stratus, anothermodel 120 Yamaichi got in last spring's deal, is being used byToshiba Engineering to develop a new application for futures andoptions trading, Stratus says.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TECHNOLOGY FORECASTING ANDHUMAN FACTORS AT HP SEMINAR  Hewlett-Packard's recent seminar on Technological ChallengesFacing the Securities Industry might well have been subtitledTrue Confessions of Trading Systems Design. Two speakers, ScottAbbey, managing director and head of worldwide operations forMorgan Stanley & Co., and George Kenney, senior vice president ofO'Connor & Associates, offered unusually candid and informativepresentations. The meeting was co-sponsored by Business Week.  Morgan Stanley does its share of strategic technologyforecasting, striving to identify the shape of trading systems tocome. Before airing his latest prognosis, Abbey turned the clockback five years to review Morgan Stanley's then-current vision oftrading systems of the future.                    "What hasn't happened..."  * The attempt to satisfy all the trader's needs -- market data,position management, analytics etc. -- with a single device was"one of the driving forces" of Morgan Stanley's developmenteffort in the early-to-mid 1980s. But it met with "tremendousresistance."  Not only was it difficult to create a single system as good atmultiple applications as separate systems would be, but tradersinsisted on being able to see all their data all the time.  * Morgan Stanley had expected to see a reduction in the averagenumber of devices per trader. Instead, the "tower of power" atmany traders' desks is actually getting higher.  * Large screen devices with partitions -- like the IBM 3290plasma display -- were a hot prospect until Abbey & company foundout that traders didn't like not being able to see over theirterminals.  * Abbey and his team also looked into windowing systems onnormal-sized displays, but traders were adamant about being ableto see "all the information," so overlapped windows werediscarded.  * He had expected much of the analytic workload to migrate frommainframes to workstations. Instead, "a lot of the MIPS on thedesk" are being applied to the user interface.  Meanwhile, "a tremendous number of Lotus spreadsheets" havepopped up on PCs. But PC power hasn't replaced any mainframes. Infact, there are even more mainframes, due to increased demand forlocal data collection, storage, processing and retrieval.                     "What Has Happened..."  * Five years ago, Abbey decided to pay the small incrementalprice of making his firm's terminals "graphics-capable." Today, alot more graphics are being used at Morgan Stanley -- forspreads, trends and graphical user interfaces.  * There's been a significant increase in the use of internaldata. Five or 10 years ago, capital markets traders used external(market) data almost exclusively. Today, more traders have accessto position data, internal research and customer data.  * More interactive software is allowing traders greaterflexibility in configuring and passing data among applications.                           What's Next  Undaunted by his spotty forecasting track record, Abbey went onto share his predictions for the next five years.  * The availability of high resolution intermediate-sized (12"-15") monitors will result in increased use of windowinginterfaces and mice. The higher resolution and larger size willsatisfy traders' need to see all their data, while the shape ofthe monitors won't obstruct vision.  * Mainframe applications developed for the batch environmentwill continue to be grandfathered -- partly because of theinvestment in new applications that talk to the old ones, andpartly because of the need to amortize the old applicationsthemselves. Systems designers, Abbey seems to say, will continueto be held hostage by financial inertia.  This prediction may hold more meaning for Morgan Stanley -- asdevelopers and users of the omnipurpose, mainframe-based Tradeprotrade processing behemoth -- than for other firms.  * Workstations will be the focal point for integration of datafrom heterogeneous in-house mainframes as well as outside datasources. Morgan Stanley has devoted a lot of resources to developconnectivity software that will allow workstations to runapplications that crunch data from remote, mainframe databases.  * Some of the incremental power of new workstations willsupport more sophisticated graphical user interfaces. For a 15 or25 MIP machine, says Abbey, one to three MIPS of windowmanagement is insignificant.  * A lot of money will be wasted on workstations simply becausethey're sexy and the salesman does a good job, and because buyerslook at the one-off cost rather than quantity.  * Another dumpster load of money will be wasted because peopledon't understand how to build distributed systems. "Despite whatanybody says," says Abbey, "I don't believe that that technologyexists and is widely understood."  Abbey believes it will take a lot of blood, sweat and tears,thousands of programming hours and "not a lot of profits" to makea distributed system work. But he believes the investment isnecessary. "There's no way around it; we have to fail and we haveto stand up to our management and say, this is why we have to doit."                     The Facts of Half-Life  Now with O'Connor, George Kenney came from the American StockExchange where he guided the development of a theoretical optionspricing system (TOPS). The system was developed, Kenney says,because specialists on the floor of the Chicago Board OptionsExchange were consistently out-quoting the AMEX specialists.Kenney's AMEX experience left him with a healthy respect for thehuman and political factors of systems design.  The first duty of a trading systems designer, according toKenney, is to survive long enough to complete a project.Unfortunately, "the time it takes to implement and design anarchitecture greatly exceeds the half-life of MIS directors."  At the AMEX, Kenney lasted two years. His successor, saysKenney, must decide whether to complete the project Kenneystarted or throw it away or do something that will have his nameon it. Kenney advises systems architects to make a "soberassessment of the political climate, both yours personally andthat of the firm."Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TECHNOLOGY FORCASTINGPART TWO                     Consider the Lowly User  But the biggest challenge facing the systems designer, saysKenney, is making "the impedance match between these greatsystems you're spending all this money to design and this pooruser who has to use it."  Kenney had just come from visiting the New York offices of hisnew employer. And while praising O'Connor's "tremendoustechnology," he also points out that "a lot of the users reallydon't know how to turn the systems on, so 95% of the sparkle thatsystem can deliver is really lost."  Systems designers, says Kenney, are the least qualified peopleto make the match between systems and users because they thinkdifferently from users. Designers, for example, are comfortablewith "hidden information," while users are not.  Kenney told of a brief encounter with one AMEX specialistduring tests of an electronic display book. The specialistremarked, You see this ticket? I can touch it. I can smell it,and I trust it. And I don't trust this electronic book. You'llsneak orders into it and I'll never know about them.'                       Eggheads Under Fire  Systems designers, according to Kenney, don't like talking tousers. Instead, they like to deal with system specifications."They get the specs and then go hide behind them and design theirsystem and then they sort of throw it over the wall," saidKenney.  Talking to users is "very painful" for systems designers,according to Kenney. "It takes time -- time away from valuabledesign." Kenney likens the state of computer systems design toautomotive engineering in the 1940s.  Apropos of systems design, Kenney acknowledges his intellectualdebt to John D. Gould, a human factors scientist at IBM'sHawthorne, New York research center. Gould's paper, "How toDesign Usable Systems," will appear as a chapter in the "Handbookof Human-Computer Interaction" edited by Martin Helander and tobe published by North-Holland Press.  The Gould paper describes "good computer systems" as "easy tolearn, easy to use, contain[ing] the... functions that allowpeople to do the things they want to do, and that are well-liked." To meet these goals, Gould says designers should learn topay more attention to users and the user interface throughout thedesign process.                  How to Design Usable Systems  Several clever tactics for increasing user orientation -- bothin the conceptual and testing phases -- are advocated by Gould,including:  * Begin writing the user manual before any code is written --in some cases the draft user manual can become the definitivedesign document;  * Define explicit behavioral targets (not MIPS or I/O rates)for systems performance and test for them. A behavioral goalmight be, after an hour's unsupervised exposure to the system, atrader must be able to execute 10 trades, accurately enter thetrade data, and check his position, in two minutes';  * Eliminate intermediaries, such as marketing research people,between systems designers and users;  * While observing users, ask them to think aloud about whatthey are doing as they are doing it;  * Schedule design meetings in users' work areas;  * Observe and videotape users in their work environment --videotapes "are often much more convincing than charts and oralreports;  * Include users on the design team -- participative designimproves the probability of user acceptance;  * Sketch user scenarios and show them to the design team toprovoke arguments about the user interface;  * Create mock-ups and simulations -- one group simulated a"listening typewriter" by having a concealed typist enter whatusers said.                   Living in a "Sea of Change"  Like Kenney, Gould accuses systems designers of avoidingcontact with users whenever possible. As a result, designers tendto design systems to satisfy themselves, not users. "Smartsystems designers like to build projects that have highintellectual content," says Kenney.  Gould also thinks designers must learn to embrace failure inorder to succeed. Since nobody, no matter how gifted, gets itright the first time, designers must commit to an iterativeprocess, says Gould, and be willing to work in the midst of a"sea of change."  Of course, an iterative design process is only possible withthe right tools. Gould acknowledges the need for a user interfacemanagement system (UIMS).  The UIMS, says Gould, "provides for a well defined interfacebetween that portion of the code that contains the user interfaceand that portion of the code that implements the functions of theuser interface." Gould cites "Apollo Computer's ADM" and"Cosmic's (NASA software) TAE" as examples of commerciallyavailable UIMSs.                      Off the Drawing Board  Kenney actually used some of Gould's techniques whiledeveloping AMEX's TOPS. He hired two industrial psychologists whospent three months gaining the confidence of the specialists anddeveloping a model of the user interface. He formed a userscommittee and developed story boards depicting user scenarios. Hedesigned a mock-up of a custom keyboard, and prototyped asimulator for users on a PC.  "The users were becoming authors; they became invested in thesystem," says Kenney. "And user satisfaction is key to thesurvivability of the MIS director." Key, but no guarantee.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990  Jan. 18 -- Introduction to Real-Time Financial Market Data presented  Jan. 18 -- Introduction to Real-Time Financial Market Data presentedby Waters Information Services; New York.

The SEC wantsexecutives to evaluate and disclose the market risks their companiesface and how they use derivatives as a hedge.  While the action isintended to give investors a better understanding of the risksinvolved with hedging, a new survey suggests many corporate financeprofessionals don't fully understand the risks themselves.     While there has been a dramatic effort in the last year or two toestablish or update corporate investment policies, "where we get intoa little bit of a problem is in the risk measurement and controlelement of those policies," says Robert Baldoni, managing director  ofIrvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting.Stumped by Value-at-Risk     Emcor polled treasury executives recently at multinationalcorporations and found that two-thirds of the more than 80 respondentsbelieved they did not have an adequate understanding of value-at-risk(VAR).       Widely endorsed, VAR is considered an essential component of thenew SEC proposals.  The VAR approach looks at the entire corporaterisk profile, not just the individual transaction -- which is wherecorporations tend to focus, says Baldoni.  "Many people are gettinginvolved in complex transactions and are not necessarily aware of theramifications," he says.       The SEC action comes exactly a year after the bankruptcy filingof Orange County, Calif.  The municipality lost more than $1.5 billionin ill-advised derivatives trades.  Similar recent disasters led theSEC to review the annual reports of some 500 public companies to gaugehow well market risk was being evaluated and reported to investors.     As a result of that investigation, the SEC is calling for newquantitative and qualitative disclosures of hedging activity.  Theaccounting policy for derivatives will have to be detailed within thecorporate financial statements. And the agency wants to see "anarrative discussion" of the company's primary market risk exposuresand how those exposures are managed.  TREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT,January 19, 1996                                                           To the extent that derivatives or other financial instruments areused to hedge a company's primary market risk, the SEC proposes threealternatives to disclose the associated risks:     * The first option is to present a table with "common inputs tomarket risk measurement methods," so that investors and analysts canplug the data into their own models and do their own risk analysis;       * Alternatively, corporate financial executives may choose topresent a  "sensitivity analysis," illustrating the potential impactof certain hypothetical market moves.  The SEC cautions that adetailed explanation of the modeling techniques and parameters must beincluded so that investors understand the analysis;     * The third option is a VAR model which calculates the net effectof all of the hedges used entity-wide.  The risk projection isexpressed as the most that could be lost over a specific period -- aday, a week, a month -- with a statistically-derived confidence level. In other words, a typical VAR expression would be that over the nextquarter there is a 90 percent confidence level that the loss potentialdue to market activity will be no more than x dollars.  To have thatkind of overarching measure of market risk requires some sophisticatednumber crunching.Why VAR, Why Now?     Little about the VAR concept is new, except the need to apply itin a corporate environment.  Financial institutions with dynamictrading operations long have used the approach.  And while mostcorporations have fairly simple and stable hedging positions, Baldonisays that's changing:  "As we have gotten into more complexinstruments the risk profile has changed.  And unfortunately, theinstruments that are being offered are way ahead of the controlsystems in most of these institutions."      The basic statistical concepts of standard deviation, varianceand covariance are at the heart of the so-called "analytic approach,"to VAR, but various simulation methods can also produce VARmeasurements.  However, even the most vigilant risk manager may bestumped by where to get the numbers.       Until New York-based J.P. Morgan introduced its RiskMetricsdatabase in the fall of 1994, there wasn't a reliable, consistentsource of data, says Mike Salzberg, partner with Price Waterhouse inNew York.       "One of our goals is to demystify derivatives," explains JacquesLongerstaey, head of the Market Risk Research unit at Morgan.  Thefirm provides free access to data on commodity futures, fixed-income,equity and currency markets, as well as volatility measures andcorrelations.  The RiskMetrics data is available via the Internet(http://www.jpmorgan.com), and such information services as Bloomberg,Reuters and Dow Jones Telerate.       Access to data has not been the only barrier to widespread use ofVAR.  In fact, 84 percent of the respondents in the Emcor surveyindicated they have not used the RiskMetrics database.       A majority indicated they simply don't have the software to makeuse of the data, which is probably not surprising considering a baselevel VAR package runs from $100,000 to $200,000 a year, according toBaldoni.  He adds that cheaper packages on the market are not verygood.       "To pay for the software and get your people trained you've gotto have the deal flow to justify it," he says.  Most corporationsdon't, and will choose to outsource the analysis. Who Is Responsible for VAR?     Under the new SEC proposals, a corporation will be heldaccountable for the risk quantification that is put before the public. "I think it's beginning to open up a very interesting issue," saysSalzberg of Price Waterhouse.  "Once it starts getting into the areaof actually disclosing numbers, who's responsible for that number?  Isit the risk manager?  The capital markets guy?  The CFO who signs hisname on the report?"       Baldoni says his goal with the VAR concept is to make the numbersunderstandable to the highest levels of the corporation, "so, 10 or 12months later when something goes wrong people aren't saying, 'Oh, Ididn't know.'"     The SEC's stated goal is to make risk quantificationunderstandable to investors, and that, Salzberg says, will haverepercussions in the market.       "Suppose I divide VAR into revenue?What I wind up with is a risk-adjusted value," allowing investors togauge how much they're putting at risk to make that return, heexplained.       "That's how we choose between investments," adds Salzberg, and "right now we can't do that."  But he cautions that VARs should beconsidered directional measures, and not absolute numbers.     "Establishing an historic pattern of risk-adjusted numbers willallow investors to look back and see how accurate the company has beenin determining its risk profile," he says.

Sutton, SEC, 202-942-4400.)CORPORATE-VALUE-AT-RISK        The value-at-risk (VAR) approach was developed by and for thetrading operations of financial institutions, but has been endorsedfor corporate use by the Group of Thirty, the International Swaps andDerivatives Association, the Financial Executives Institute and nowthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.        Irvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consultingdeveloped a proprietary risk measurement system which they callCorporate-Value-At-Risk (CVAR).  The concept embodies four distinctmeasures, each of which can employ the full range of statisticalanalysis -- variance, covariance, historic scenario analysis, MonteCarlo analysis, etc.:* Operating ExposureThis measures the underlying risk exposure that results from thecompany's operating activities to determine if there is enough risk towarrant the time spent managing it.* Financial Instrument ExposureThis step applies the same analysis specifically to the financialinstruments chosen to manage the company's underlying risk.  Thesetools include such things as securities, debt and hedge instruments.* Operating Exposure and HedgesStep three is to overlay measures one and two and run the same riskanalysis a third time.  This measure, when compared with the company'sinitial operating exposure, should indicate a lower overall level ofrisk.* Counterparty ExposureThis analysis focuses on the company's risk exposure to each financialinstitution that serves as a counterparty.  It provides a measure ofthe upside potential of the hedging portfolio, so that the companystays below its counterparty credit limit.

All of which, it is expected, will significantly raise the cost ofplan administration.          The measure was introduced in the midst of the holidayseason, betwixt government shutdowns and before the east coastdisappeared under a blizzard.  Because of the timing, reaction against the bill has been muted, "butmy guess is you're going to see mobilization," says Paul Doxsee, vicepresident of St. Paul, Minn.-based Pension Solutions Inc., themarketing arm of MSI Insurance Group which specializes in 401(k) planadministration for firms with fewer than 500 employees. When Is An Audit Not An Audit?        Plan administrators, under current law, can exclude certainpension plan assets from the annual audit as long as those assets areinvested with a regulated institution such as a bank or insurancecompany.  The assumption has been that those assets are being auditedelsewhere.  About half of the required audits under the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) contain a "limited scopedisclaimer."         "Potentially, the majority of the assets in a plan aren'taudited, and then you're not getting the full benefit of an audit,"says Sue Hicks with the American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants (AICPA) in Washington, D.C.              Since 1987 the U. S. General Accounting Office and the U.S.Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General have issued separatereports questioning the suitability of limited scope audits.          To further dramatize the situation, U.S. Secretary of LaborRobert B. Reich announced in November that Department of Labor (DOL)investigators had more than 300 civil- and criminal inquiries underwayagainst companies accused of improperly diverting 401(k) funds. Doxsee acknowledges DOL has found some bad apples, but says, "I thinkthey've already heightened the awareness ... why do they need theaudit requirement on top of it?"     Although the independent Washington, D.C.-based, Employee BenefitResearch Institute (EBRI) has not taken an official position on thebill, organization president Dallas Salisbury says the bill's reformscome at a relatively high price "with the principal beneficiariesbeing the nation's accounting firms."    Whatever the cost, it's outweighed by the benefits, says theAICPA's Hicks.  The benefits, however, may be in the eye of thebeholder.  While DOL  traditionally has found most 401(k) problems insmall firms, plans with fewer than 100 employees are exempt fromaudits altogether.  "This would be a further cost and discouragementfor large plans while not doing anything to get at the problemsrelated to small plans," says Salisbury.         According to Hicks, AICPA committees have estimated thelegislation would push up the cost of a pension plan audit by 10percent-to-40 percent.  "I would say that for some of our clients whoare marginally profitable, that increase may force a decision todiscontinue the plan.  That's very real.  To a small employer, $500 to$1000 matters a great deal," says Doxee.

Back to Headline List CopyrightTREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996RESOURCEIQ OPENS WINDOW TO EUROPE   Privately-held ADS Associates Inc. is considering conquering theworld, again.  The Calabasas, Calif.-based software developer hasestablished sales and service outposts throughout the world to supportGlobal Trader, a leading broker-dealer work station used by centralbanks and global financial institutions.  But the company's treasurymanagement workstation, Resource, has barely ventured outside NorthAmerica.  That may change this year.   "Our new Windows product was designed with an eye towardinternational applications," says Harvey Holman, vice president forsales.  "The DOS-based Resource product was very much North America-oriented," he adds.   The Windows release, ResourceIQ, is due out in June and isexpected to introduce several unique features.  Among them, a "dragand drop" capability that allows figures and graphs to be moved tooutside applications without the intermediary step of going to anASCII flat file.   Similarly, a spreadsheet figure showing an account surplus can bemoved and dropped on a wire transfer icon and automatically moved intoan overnight investment.  "Through an application programminginterface, all the appropriate wire transfer information moves alongwith the figure," says Holman.   In addition to the new gee-whiz functionality, ResourceIQ hasgained derivatives, sensitivity analysis and risk analysisfunctionality from Global Trader -- "all the things that corporateswant, but have traditionally not been able to afford," says Holman.  Whereas a Global Trader workstation runs between $1 million and $3million, the average Resource installation costs $30,000-to-$80,000.   Annette Sneckenberg, financial operations manager for a $3 billionOmaha-based conglomerate, settled on the ADS Resource workstation ayear ago after grilling three vendors.  "Overall, they had the betterpackage, and the people who came to do the demo were so knowledgeablewe couldn't stump them on anything," Sneckenberg says.  Her firm,privately-held Peter Kiewit Sons, has more than 250 subsidiaries.  "Wewere looking for an investment system that could run the gamut," shesays.

With neither economic indicators nor a federal budget to guideforecasts, corporate credit issuers are on the sidelines.     Beyond Wall Street, the federal government shutdown has blackedout more than data.  Billions of dollars in civilian and militaryexport licenses are held up at the Commerce Department; Small BusinessAdministration loans have dried up; and government contractors havebeen idled.       At the same time, the East Coast blizzard silenced majorretailing centers from Boston to Richmond.  Wall Street's manicreaction to the federal budget talks sank the stock and bond marketslast week when political differences appeared to put off any hope of abalanced budget pact.     The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is down over 2.5 percent for theyear to date.  Similarly, the bond market has given back its lateDecember gains, pushing the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond over the 6percent mark.  The Federal Reserve Board's open market committee meetsagain Jan. 30, but most market analysts expect the Fed is as much inthe dark as they are and so will put off any interest rate action.       What little information the market has comes from the Fed thisweek with its report on December industrial production and capacityutilization.  The U.S. Labor and Commerce Departments are expected tobe catching up this week on overdue reports covering gross nationalproduct, employment, retail sales and producer and consumer prices.   Back to Headline List CopyrightTREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996FIRMS WORRY ABOUT BUDGET FIGHT   A poll conducted last month by the Morristown, N.J.-basedFinancial Executives Institute (FEI), found that senior financialexecutives in the United States are concerned about the failure ofPresident Clinton and the U.S. Congress to reach a balanced- budgetagreement.  Asked how a budget impasse would directly affect theircompanies, 68 percent predicted higher interest rates; 56 percentexpected reduced sales; 40 percent believed it would negatively affectemployment; and 50 percent said it would decrease their companies'stock prices.  An earlier FEI membership poll, conducted in earlyNovember, found most of the respondents in favor of Congress' toughtactics -- two-thirds of the respondents said they favored tying anextension of the federal debt ceiling to passage of the budgetreconciliation package.

Back to Headline List CopyrightTREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996STOCK OPTION ACCOUNTING WORRIES HIGH TECH FIRMS    Corporate financial officers may have won a round with theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), but now many are findingthey still have a lot to lose.  After facing years of opposition, theFASB agreed in October to back down from its plan to require thatcorporate financial statements reflect the value of stock optionsgranted as compensation.   The FASB wanted corporations to fix a cost to those options andcharge it against earnings.  While that won't happen, effectiveJanuary 1 the FASB is requiring that the same valuation be included incorporate financial footnotes.  "This is one footnote I hope thereaders of our financial statements don't read," says Chris Paisley,chief financial officer for 3Com Corp., a Santa Clara, Calif.-basedhigh technology firm.   It's not that Paisley has anything to hide, other than a profoundbefuddlement over how to value the thousands of options his companygrants each year.  All 4,600 of 3Com's employees receive options aspart of the company's bonus and incentive program.  "We were obviouslynone too thrilled with this pronouncement," says Paisley.  Start-uphigh tech firms like 3Com routinely use stock options in lieu ofscarce cash to attract top talent.   FASB Provides Questionable Model     The FASB's Statement 123 explains that for stock options "fairvalue is determined using an option-pricing model that takes intoaccount the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, theexpected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stockand the expected dividends on it, and the risk-free interest rate overthe expected life of the option."    "When CFOs realize the complexity of what they're going to haveto do, they're going to be in shell shock because it's not going to bean easy compliance by any stretch," says Cheryl Breetwor, president ofSunnyvale, Calif.-based ShareData, which provides software for stockoption accounting to some 2000 customers throughout the United States. To date, ShareData has produced software that merely tracks acompany's stock options, keeping up with who's vested, and how manyoptions have been exercised.  Putting a value on those options issomething else.   "It's not nearly as simple as the FASB has made it sound.  It'sgoing to be very costly," she says.  Not only will the software willbe expensive, but so will the consulting help Breetwor assumescompanies will need in making projections about stock price,dividends, length of employee service and interest rates, all of whichare needed to feed the FASB model.

It's not hard to see why.First and foremost, banks have been restructuring their balance sheets toimprove liquidity.  According to a recent survey by Olson Research Associatesand the Bank Administration Institute, robust loan demand has fueled an urgentquest for liquidity since 1993.  Banks have taken net paydowns on securitiesor have actively liquidated securities positions to fund the growth of loans.This ongoing process is the expected flip side of the early 1990s, when therewas strong growth in the portfolio amid poor loan demand.A second, and more enduring, reason for portfolio shrinkage may be thatinvestment officers now have to worry about a new dimension of portfoliomanagement.  These days, the chief investment officer or portfolio managermust manage not only the yield on the bank's portfolio but also its marketvalue.  Not that it wasn't always important to manage investment marketvalues, but the difference now is that evolving accounting standards compelspecific market value disclosure.  Executive managers and stock analysts alikecan exercise greater scrutiny because of the new visibility of portfoliovalues.It all traces back to Financial Accounting Standard 115 for disclosures aboutdebt instruments.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued thisstandard in 1993 as part of the Board's long-range project on financialinstruments, initiated in 1986.  FAS 115 creates three different accountingapproaches pertaining to market valuation for banks' and other firms'investment securities.  For changes in market values of trading securities,gains and losses are passed through the profit and loss statement and thecapital account.For "available for sale" securities (AFS), changes in market value arerecognized in the banks' capital accounts and, along with trading securities,potentially destabilize reported bank capital.  "Held to maturity" securities(HTM) do not create accounting gains and losses, nor do they impact reportedcapital, but they must meet rigorous standards concerning the bank's abilityand intent to hold them until they mature.Of course, fluctuations in the market values of bank securities are a highlyvisible beacon of interest rate risk.  Gap charts in banks' annual reportsappear benign and only mildly suggest interest rate exposures to bankearnings.  In contrast, changes in market values hit the bullseye ofinterest-rate risk measurement and grab the annual report reader's attention.It's a worrisome thing for executive managements who may connect theircompensation with the need to report ever-improving performance.I Shrunk the PortfolioSo, naturally, some banking firms have shrunk the portfolio itself to reducethe impact of portfolio instability.  Many firms view a portion of theinvestment portfolio as discretionary.  It's the part funded withdiscretionary wholesale money and is not just a parking place for coredeposits.  It's no secret that acquisition-minded superregional banks arebacking away from large wholesale banking positions that add volatility andare reemphasizing their core businesses.This strategy contributes to the shrinkage of the portfolio.  Banking firmsare restructuring their balance sheets by laying off gobs of wholesale fundsand the portions of the portfolios that these funds supported; instead, theirbalance sheets are absorbing core loans and funds obtained through theacquisition of smaller banks.PNC Bank Corp.  provides a good example of portfolio shrinkage.  In mid-1994,PNC's $22-billion investment portfolio comprised 36% of the bank's earningassets-quite large by industry standards at that time.  The bank embarked onan aggressive strategy of emphasizing its core franchise, including a landmarkacquisition of Chemical Bank branches in New Jersey, and backing away fromwholesale funding and investing.  By late 1995, the portfolio had been reducedto below $19 billion.  In the process, the bank exorcised some troublesomeinvestments and took heavy losses.Still, PNC had a problem because HTM securities represented over 80% of theportfolio.  Under FAS 115, these securities escaped accounting for gains andlosses, but the restrictiveness of the HTM classification tended to freezethem in place and make them unmanageable.  And transferring part of them intothe AFS portfolio risked regulatory tainting of the remaining HTM securitiesthat might lead to their subsequent revaluation.At yearend 1995, in a bold departure from the temptation to disguise thevolatility of its HTM portfolio permitted by FAS 115, PNC was said to bepreparing to transfer all of the HTM portfolio to the AFS classification.Apparently the bank is now willing to expose all of its securities activity tomarket pricing.The new FASB-driven focus on volatility has changed the way banks view thepurpose of their investment portfolios.  According to the Olson/BAI survey,chief investment officers most often state that the primary objective of theirsecurities portfolios is to manage interest rate risk, followed by managingliquidity.It would be an understatement to declare that FAS 115 does not get greatsupport from bankers.  A very legitimate complaint is that it does not allowfor symmetrical market value adjustments to the funding side of securitiespositions.  And, like a lot of regulation, it leaves room for inconsistencyamong examiners and invites arbitrary enforcement.  It's not clear how muchportfolio shrinkage is due to distaste for the new accounting rules and thevisibility the rules give to investment performance and how much is due tocyclical effects that sacrifice investment performance in the quest forliquidity to service loan demand.Our speculation is that even an imperfect FAS 115 will eventually change therole and practice of investment management for the better.  Nay-sayers pointout that judging portfolio performance by tracking unrealized gains and lossesdoes not recognize the awkward role the portfolio must play because it isroutinely whipsawed by the loan market.In general, if an investment manager is going to take an aggressive position,it will occur when earnings on the investment portfolio are most critical tobank profits.  Information on how a bank management team reaches for thoseearnings or how it moves cyclically from a liquidity support mode to anearnings mode ought to be more apparent to users of its financial information.In this context, market value information ought to add a crucial element ofdiscipline to future investment management.Donald G.  Simonson holds the New Mexico Bankers Chair in Banking and Financeat the University of New Mexico.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Point of viewMy vote for the most dynamic banker of the past decade goes to Hugh L.  McCollJr., chairman of NationsBank.  I'm not sure he's the best banker, at least notby the criteria that most people would use, since NationsBank's performancehas tended to be fairly average as measured by traditional yardsticks likereturn on assets or loan quality.  I've always thought of McColl as more of abuilder, and banking just happened to be the business that he was in.McColl was the keynote speaker at a recent industry conference, where hedelivered a stirring wake-up call about the importance of the Internet andon-line commerce to the industry's future.  McColl is not a tall man, but hehas a deep, booming voice that begins in the soles of his shoes and builds allthe way up.  It was good to hear him say that the industry's greatest threatis not Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, but rather its own indecisiveness in theface of change.  McColl is an unlikely person to emerge as banking's mostvocal leader, and yet he played the same role last year with the passage ofinterstate banking legislation.  I say "unlikely" because for years, McCollseemed to have a chip on his shoulder, the hard-bitten ex-Marine who kept ahand grenade on his desk and had a "war room" where he plotted his mergerstrategy.  Who would listen to a guy hell-bent on taking them over?I've written two stories about McColl since 1987 and learned something eachtime.  The first time around, I learned that he doesn't take well tocriticism, as when I wrote that his tough-guy rhetoric was the main reason whyfew bankers wanted to merge with him.  His spokesman coolly informed me laterthat I had so offended McColl that he wasn't going to talk to the pressanymore.  The second encounter, in 1993, taught me that McColl can be warm anddelightfully down-to-earth as well.  An investment banker told me of flyinginto Charlotte, where NationsBank is headquartered, to pitch a deal to McColl,whom he had not met before.  My source expected someone from the bank to fetcha colleague and him from the airport-but that "someone" turned out to beMcColl himself, holding up a little sign like a limo driver and grinning fromear to ear.  Later, as they were racing into town in McColl's BMW, thechairman spotted a friend who had pulled his car off the highway.  McCollquickly stopped to see what was wrong.  When they stayed to BS for a while, mysource started thinking this wasn't your normal CEO.My favorite story also occurred when I was not around.  Photos for the secondpiece were shot at a Habitat for Humanity job site, where McColl was helpingbuild a house.  The photographer told me later that McColl noticed two youngboys playing basketball nearby with a makeshift hoop and backboard.  McColldisappeared for a while, then returned with a new hoop, which he proceeded toput up for them.The point of all this is that McColl might be a more effective leader ifpeople knew him better.  His trash talk of years past has largely obscuredboth his warmth and sense of humor.  The media is partly responsible for this,but McColl and his advisers share in the blame.  When he appeared on the coverof Fortune last August crouching with a shotgun while bird hunting, itreinforced the old image of the hungry predator.  Banking doesn't have leaderslike it did 20 years ago.  It could use a few now, and McColl might fit thebill if he allowed a fuller, more balanced picture of himself to emerge.John W.  Milligan Editor-in-ChiefBack to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996USB Forum:  Talking MergersA combination of factors-high stock prices, declining revenue and the fear ofbeing left behind-helped create a robust market for bank mergers in 1995.  Inan effort to review the year's most significant developments, as well as peerinto the year ahead, U.S.  Banker assembled a crack team of investment bankersfor a thorough discussion about shareholder activism, hostile takeovers anddeal fatigue, to name only a few issues.  The participants were:  Robert A.Baer Jr., Bear, Stearns & Co.; John Duffy, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods; KathleenM.  Fisher, J.P.  Morgan & Co.; J.  Christopher Flowers, Goldman, Sachs & Co.;John C.  "Hans" Morris, Smith Barney; and Kendrick Wilson, Lazard Freres & Co.The moderator was John W.  Milligan, editor-in-chief of U.S.  Banker.USB:  Let's talk a little bit about why 1995 turned out to be such a greatmarket for bank mergers.  What were some of the things that drove the market?DUFFY:  The first thing is maybe valuation; stock valuation led the acquireruniverse to be able to pay prices that a lot of the seller universe foundacceptable.  I think you also had a situation with a couple turnarounds wheremaybe all of the fixing up had been done.  People like Midlantic, Shawmut andFirst Fidelity probably fit that category.  So you had sellers; you had auniverse of people that were maybe not perceived to be sellers two years agothat today were sellers for a new reason.WILSON:  I think you might call it a revenue "crunch."  There aren't too manyinstitutions on their own looking at double-digit revenue growth.  Banks havebenefited from an improvement in credit quality and a steep yield curve, andnow it is tough to get revenue.  Also, many managers are saying, "I can't cutmy expenses any more, I might have to think about an acquisition."FISHER:  An incredible confluence of events is encouraging merger activity.Bank stocks are up 50% this year (1995) versus roughly 30% for the market, andthis clearly has made the banks feel well off in terms of their currency.  Butthey look ahead and ask where revenue growth is going to come from.  And it isan amazing dichotomy to have those conversations going on when the stockprices look so favorable.  So why not use your currency to make an acquisitionnow?  It is as good a time as any.  And the sellers appreciate that it is agreat time to sell at these prices, so they are selling.BAER:  An additional reason is that shareholder activism is responsible forspecific deals; where Michael Price has gone into Chase Manhattan and MichiganNational and taken positions that led directly to those firms turning over.USB:  Was Michael Price a phenomenon of one-specifically, his involvement withChase and whatever pressure he applied there-or does that happen more broadly,but (in) situations that are not as public?BAER:  If you look at the 13D filings, there has been-I don't know what thenumber would be this year-but probably in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 thathad been filed with a letter attendant to that filing going to the board,stating that, "We think you should research your various alternatives toincrease shareholder value, including the sale of the bank."  It is not justMichael, there are several groups out there.USB:  How many of those situations yielded something similar to what happenedwith Chase?BAER:  I can't think of one of them that so far in 1995 has resulted in thedecision by the institution to sell.MORRIS:  I think more than the specific cause and effect of a singleshareholder, it is more an aura in the defensiveness of the company that itcreates.  Good management teams are more credible, and the more credible youare, the less you really care about what any particular shareholder suggestsyou should do.  I think many people would say that whether Michael Pricecaused the sale of Chase into Chemical is not as much of an issue as whetherit clearly changed the overall tempo and framework in which Chase had to makedecisions.FISHER:  Shareholder activism has also heightened the sensitivity levels ofdirectors, and there is now a significant increase in the activism ofdirectors in many of these situations versus the past.BAER:  That is important.  The Bank of Boston is an extreme case of wheredirectors seemingly took the place of management for a while.  I think therehas been a number of examples which have not gone that far, but certainly thedirectors are tenfold more involved on a daily basis than they had been in thepast.USB:  If you are representing a bank that may feel vulnerable to an offer fromanother institution, perhaps because it has hit its own revenue wall, and yetis not ready to surrender its independence, how do you counsel the CEO?  Whatis that CEO's obligation when it comes to entertaining a merger offer?MORRIS:  First off, what is the strategy of the bank?  If you don't have aplan, you really don't have any reason to think that you can earn a reasonablereturn for your shareholders.  Further, you will be forgoing a potentialtakeover premium.  I think it is not responsible for a management team to saywe just want an investment banker to defend our position, even though we don'thave a good plan for what to do about it.  The first thing is helping themsort out strategies of what they can do about this position.There is a lot of current discussion about that very issue, in terms of whatwe mean by the revenue wall and how banks are looking at branches and how theyshould be speaking about expenses and efficiencies.  For a long time, bankshad a model that they felt that they could aim towards, and get down to theirpeer group in efficiency, and they could adequately manage theirnon-performing assets and manage their capital and buy back stock.  It isclear that you have to go beyond that and have a better plan than yourcompetitors to be attractive to the market.USB:  If you have the plan but haven't accomplished it yet, what are yourequired to do in terms of reviewing an offer and so on?MORRIS:  If you have a plan, and you have a good plan, you are not required todo anything.  You are required to carefully consider things and listen to bonafide offers.  Ultimately it is the credibility of management and theconfidence that you can create with your own directors and with your ultimateshareholders-and your ability to execute-that is going to decide whether youhave support for your stock and support to continue to execute that plan.DUFFY:  Hans is right.  The board needs to be educated in terms of how theplan will create value for the shareholders.  Otherwise, anybody that walks inthe door with a premium over market could be viewed as legitimate.WILSON:  Obviously, a plan is important, but if you don't have a good offense,your defense will be under a lot of pressure.  I think there is no substitutefor frequent and ongoing communication with your shareholders.  A track recordhelps.  I think having a board that is well-informed and supportive is key.This is very important, because many of these activist investors are not shyabout using their telephones or fax machines to contact directors.  There havebeen several instances where management with credibility and a good story havedefeated well-organized attacks.  All things being equal, in our experiencemanagement starts with a leg up if they are credible and prepared.USB:  If you wait until you are under pressure and vulnerable, that is a lousytime to decide that you need to communicate better with shareholders.FLOWERS:  Several companies have successfully formulated new plans afterreceiving offers.  You might say-in fact I think you would say-it would besmarter to do it in advance.  That doesn't seem to be necessary.  You askedwhat does the company do that has single-digit revenue growth.  One thingeverybody all over the place is doing is buying back their stock in largequantities and adding two or three percentage points to their growth rate.That appears to have been a very successful strategy and makes a lot of sense,I guess.  We will find out.  Maybe they are paying too much for the stock, andthey could have bought it back for less later.  Right now, it seems to makesense.The other comment I would make is I think in responding to offers and thinkingabout the whole arena, boards and managements have become much more attuned tothe quality of what they are getting.  I don't know if anybody remembers fiveor three years ago, I found much more focus on just pure dollars.USB:  There was at one point this year, and I guess it would have been July orAugust, when a series of deals were announced.  It almost seemed like afrenzy.  What accounted for that?FLOWERS:  Two factors.  One is, not only the high stock price, but also thefact that they declined precipitously early in 1995 and then bounced back, andresulted in managements and boards realizing that it may not be forever thatthey can choose their options.  They have to do this at a time when shareprices are high, and that isn't always the case.  And it went through a briefperiod where a lot of the options were eliminated and they came back and theysaid, "We better get on with this."  The second thing is, I do think there isa bit of a situation where Party A does a deal and Party B says, "If they didit, then I will too," and so forth.  For one thing, it makes it morerespectable if your next-door neighbor sells out.WILSON:  There are two other issues to think about.  First, managementsuccession can be a factor in deals, particularly among boards where you havehad a very effective and strong CEO who is near retirement with no onedesignated as his successor.  A second factor is that many management teamshave equity packages that are worth a lot of money now, as well as severancearrangements that compensate them for a change of control.MORRIS:  In some sense, the seminal transaction was First Fidelity in thatlight, because here you had someone (Anthony Terracciano) who was not thetypical old CEO, and one who had a lot of institutional credibility.  He waswell-regarded by his peers and well-regarded by the Wall Street analysts, andhe had done extremely well managing that institution.  He laid out in a veryarticulate way what his thinking was in deciding to approach a couple ofinstitutions in a sale, and that led to other boards of directors, and oftenindividual directors, to call their CEO and ask, "What do we think aboutthat?"Frankly, the fundamental facts of the industry are still before us.  There isrevenue growth which is at best five percent for the industry, and you havesome very challenging decisions that need to be made about commitments todifferent types of infrastructure, and it is not easy.  And if you havesomeone who is a leader like Tony Terracciano coming to the same conclusion, Ithink that made it easier for others to go along.  And I don't necessarilythink of this as a cop-out, but it sort of led to a series of discussionsamong all banks, which accelerated the trend.DUFFY:  I think every transaction has an impact on other people's options, andsometimes they result in fewer options to the remaining institutions, and itforces them to accelerate their thinking.  Maybe they knew they were going tosell the institution within the next three years, but all of a sudden one oftheir potential partners has just done a deal which precludes the combinationof the two of them.  He now has only two potential partners left.  He wouldrather be in the position of negotiating or having an option with two of themrather than having just one person left on the dance floor.USB:  The fundamental factors that we have talked about vis-a-vis 1995-arevenue wall, strong currency, sound asset quality-they all seem to still bein place today.  What would you anticipate in terms of 1996?BAER:  I think one thing that will force people to rethink their future isthat many of the companies in the last few years have focused on cost-cutting.But to the extent that savings have been derived, it is not a recurringsource.  As banks reach the end of their cost-cutting, they have to lookelsewhere for revenue.  I think the banks then have to go back to basics andask, "How will we get the revenue up again?"  That is forcing them to turn toacquisitions as a way to increase revenue.  So, if things stay in place, ifthe market remains strong and the P/Es stay high for the acquirers, I thinkyou will see a continuation of this.FLOWERS:  I sense a fair amount of deal fatigue out there.  I think with thehuge deals, it is hard to do more than one at a time.  One thing we will seeis people assimilating some of the very large transactions before moving on tothe next one.  That doesn't take that long.  I mean, nine months or a yearlater the whole world could change.  In the short run, it will affect themarket.BAER:  That is exactly right for the bigger deals.  This year we have had farfewer numerical deals than last year or even the year before.  I don't thinkthere is the same deal fatigue at the smaller institutions, and I believe wewill probably see in 1996 more smaller transactions rather than largertransactions.USB:  Deal fatigue:  Chris, is that a reason why it seems that in the last twoor three months (deal) volume has really flattened out?FLOWERS:  I think that is some of it.  There are a certain number of potentialdeals, and we went into it, we used a lot of that in 1995, and I think therewill be somewhat less until everybody reloads.MORRIS:  I sense that a pricing discrepancy has begun to emerge.  You haveseen some very high prices get paid on a price-to-book basis, and that has ledto higher expectations on the part of sellers, and yet at the same time, Ithink lower expectations on the part of buyers, which could be a function ofdeal fatigue, but also a sense of uncertainty about how to valueinfrastructure systems.  However, the seller's expectations have not evolvedat all.  Five percent revenue growth and larger provisions coming in 1996-andwe see evidence of that all over the place-is inconsistent with some of thesevaluations.  I think that you will have some significant discrepancies emerge.USB:  There were several deals this year that were priced a little bit northof two times book, and involved some fairly significant dilution.  Were buyersfinally cooled off by shareholders who weren't anxious to see them pay quitethat much for deals?BAER:  The marketplace actually let them get away with it, by and large.DUFFY:  It has been pretty tolerant.BAER:  Three years ago, maybe we would think three percent dilution and earnout in a year and a half or something, and that is comfortable.  We are in astage far beyond that with a lot of transactions.  I am just a littleastounded that the market has been acquiescent of the banks taking the standthat they have got a birthright to do one large strategic deal.  I don't thinkthat same tolerance would have been there three or four years ago.FISHER:  Investors have generally been favorably disposed toward bankacquisitions this year.  Many of the stocks of the acquirors have bumped backto their preexisting prices eight or ten days or less after an acquisition isannounced.  The market has been quite willing to believe that projectedsavings are achievable.USB:  Would each of you tell me what you think the most significant deal in1995 has been so far, and why?WILSON:  I think the situation involving First Interstate (which is beingpursued in a hostile takeover by Wells Fargo & Co.)  subsumes virtually all ofthe elements that we have been talking about.  I think it is a long way fromover.  It could be a precursor of some additional activity, and I think willcertainly bring to the floor all of the issues that we talked about in termsof shareholder activism.  I think that is an extremely significanttransaction.FISHER:  I have to agree with that.  Certainly when looking back several yearsfrom now, this deal will be memorable because it is big and dramatic.  Andmaybe we can even hypothesize that one of the reasons there is a bit of apause in the market now is that all of the banks are watching to see how thistransaction unfolds, because it does have a lot of precedent-setting aspectsto it.  But I think we can't give short shrift to all of the other large dealsthat were done this year, because each one of them did set new precedents.The Chase and Chemical merger certainly should be looked upon as anextraordinary transaction in the U.S.MORRIS:  I already (noted) one earlier, so I will add First Chicago and NBD tomy list.  When it happened, it kind of refocused many of us on theopportunities of mergers of equals.  The recent transactions leading up tothat deal indicated that there was tremendous investor pressure on aninstitution to sell out at a premium.  And the fact that First Chicago and NBDwere able to convince investors on the value, balance street restructuring andbusiness line benefits of the combination, led to an immediate improvedvaluation for both companies' stocks.  That was very significant, compared tothe transactions that were leading up to it.DUFFY:  I agree with Kenny that First Interstate stole the limelight from therest of the sector, for at least the time being, and it has implications.  Ithink First Fidelity was kind of interesting in that it was the first biginterregional deal, and that was kind of like the dam breaking a little bit.One that probably may not be mentioned was Fleet/Shawmut in terms of themarket dominance that it created in New England.  I don't think that you haveseen that in other places else yet.  In the Midwest or Southeast, it is stillpretty fragmented.FLOWERS:  I think since we have run out of significant deals, I will suggestthe company that got the luckiest this year.  I will offer up United CountiesTrust Co., which managed to get a double dip and was acquired first byMeridian and then by CoreStates.BAER:  That was not strategic.FLOWERS:  That was luck.BAER:  If it is one deal, it is First Interstate.  It easily is something thatnone of us have seen on that scale before, and/or complexity.  And I thinkwhat's going to be very interesting is the way politics has entered into thistransaction, because we have grown into a situation realizing that we have aninefficient banking system, and the economics are driving the system toconsolidate to make it more efficient.  We now have politicians who are tryingto keep the inefficiencies for political votes.We have already got politics starting to enter into the First Interstatetransaction.  It is such a public forum, it will be an ideal place for thepoliticians to continue to play.  I think it will be interesting to see howpolitics ends up influencing the final transaction.USB:  Would you expect to see banks continue to build their productcapabilities by doing more focused transactions, consumer finance being one?BAER:  I think you would, if the banks could.  The difficulty is that themono-line companies, whether it is the B/C auto lenders or equity home lenderstoday, sell for around 25 and 30 times earnings because there is such hugegrowth potential.  But even the pure credit card companies, the pure financecompanies and other business lines that the banks would find very attractiveto enter through acquisition, are all selling at higher multiples than thebanks.  So it becomes a conundrum.  I think there is probably a high desireand a low capability.USB:  It makes you wonder about the future of the full-service,brick-and-mortar bank if it doesn't find some way of taking all of thoseproduct capabilities and tying them together to add value.DUFFY:  I think we are in the bottom of the third inning, and some people aretalking like it is the eighth inning.  And you look at the Chase/Chemical proforma market cap, and it is $20-odd billion.  I mean, supposing tomorrowMerrill Lynch decided that they wanted to sell-who could they sell to?Probably a bank.  Banks don't have the P/E today, but I think they have thecumulative market cap to be a player.  They have consistently lost marketshare to the more innovative players, whether it is a mortgage bank or assetmanagement company or auto finance company, but a bank winds up acquiring themat some point later in the cycle.While the market share of the banks has declined dramatically over the past 10years, the market cap of the industry still (overshadows) most of thecompetition.

Interestingly enough, it could serve equally well as arecruiting poster for any bank that is beginning to open new branches inretail establishments like supermarkets.Such signs clearly underscore an attitude bankers are adopting as they embracecustomers on their own turf-in stores where they do the weekly shopping.Chasing new customers in this ever-changing, highly competitive marketplacerequires new marketing skills, shedding the stodginess and acting likeretailers.While in-store banking isn't a new phenomenon, it is a fast-growing trend thatclearly has bankers excited.  Community banks, superregionals and even thriftsare embracing the idea.Many are staking out prime locations, hoping to gain an advantage overcompetitors, while others are developing branches in areas where they didn'thave a banking presence.  While supermarkets have historically made goodpartners, they aren't the only homes for in-store branches.  Generalmerchandise stores like Kmart and Wal-Mart are quickly becoming good locationsas well.In 1995, the nation's largest banks accelerated their efforts.  Wells Fargo &Co., BankAmerica Corp., Union Bank, BayBanks Inc., Barnett Banks Inc.,National City Corp.  and First State Bank all expanded their operations.The in-store movement has produced more than 3,000 branches, and many moreribbon-cutting ceremonies are planned for this year.  National CommerceServices, a Memphis-based consulting arm of National Commerce Bancorp.,forecasts as many as 5,000 branches by the year 2000."Banks are looking for alternative distribution networks," explains KathleenHolmes, managing director of the Wharton Financial Institutions Center inPhiladelphia.  "They're doing it for strategic reasons.  Some are entering newmarkets.  Others are opening branches where the local market isn't strongenough to support a traditional branch."Proponents believe the rewards make the venture worthwhile.  "An in-storebranch can be more profitable quicker than a brick-and-mortar branch."explains John W.  Garnett, president of International Banking Technologies, inNorcross, GA.  "There are lower startup costs, a captive audience-a majorityof whom are not already customers."For example, studies reveal that store branches are less expensive to buildand often become profitable much sooner than traditional branches.Supermarket branches cost $150,000 to $200,000 to install, while the tab fortraditional branches ranges between $800,000 and $3 million.  Once inoperation, they are also quicker to yield profits.  "In-store branches shouldbreak even in about 18 months," contends NCS president Douglas W.  Ferris Jr."If they are not breaking even in two-and-a-half years, something is wrong.It usually takes a traditional branch about three years to become profitable."In the '80s, success came easily for the supermarket pioneers.  With access to30,000 to 60,000 weekly supermarket customers, they attracted new prospectsmuch faster than traditional branches.  Customers embraced the concept.One-stop convenience, services that surpassed those of the automated tellermachines and interactive relationships with live tellers were the drawingcards.  Customers marveled at the thought of applying for a car loan whilecompleting their weekly grocery shopping.And sometimes a bank really hits the jackpot.  One elderly gentleman opened a$1 million savings account at a southern supermarket branch because he feltsafer.  "In a supermarket, a person walking out with groceries doesn't exposethemselves.  No one knows that they've cashed their check.  It's not uncommonto see customers open very large accounts at supermarket branches," explainsGarnett.For many, the benefits continue.  Throughout the country, supermarket bankersreport impressive financial results.  Many produced spectacular revenuesduring their first few months of operation.  In Memphis, the Tri-State Bankproudly touts how it opened 1,155 new deposit accounts during the firstquarter of '95.  Twelve hundred miles away in North Dakota, the First NationalBank's Hugo branch celebrated its 288th new account.But the novelty has pretty much worn off, and customers want more than mereconvenience.  And there have been some failures.  Banks that entered a localgrocery store without studying the local demographics or developing astrategic plan for serving that customer base generally have not done as well."Some banks have (treated) them like a branch, but they don't work like atraditional branch," notes Holmes.  "They are more like a community bank.  Youhave a closed community, so your capacity to the market is more like that of acommunity bank."Success begins with knowing the difference between supermarket andbrick-and-mortar branches."The key to success is in hiring the right staff," explains Garnett.  "Youalso must have frequent marketing and promotional programs, as well asstreamlining operations and freeing up people to go out into the aisles andsell."The People's Bank of Connecticut grasped that concept a few years ago.  Today,it operates 45 branches in Stop 'N Shop stores and plans another 46 by the endof next year."You have to change your thinking," suggests Bryan Huebner, senior vicepresident with the human resources and strategic planning unit for the bank."You have to advertise, market and sell, Huebner says.  "That requiresemployees who are experts in our products.  They must understand how theproducts serve the needs of our customers.  We also need employees who knowthat the real game is talking to as many customers as possible."BankAmerica launched its first in-store branch 10 years ago.  As an industryleader with more than 180 in-store branches, the San Francisco-based giantforesees future success through further expansion into the supermarket arena."To capitalize, you have to do things differently," cautions William G.Raymond, senior vice president for retail distribution at BankAmerica.  "Youneed to hire different kinds of people.  You need to train differently.  Youhave to set different goals and you need different operating practices."One of the keys to success is getting out into the aisles and meetingprospects," he explains.  "That's not something that many traditional bankersfeel comfortable doing.  We like to have people who are not specializedtellers or sellers.  You need people who can do many things."Raymond believes banks should train their sales force to act more like theirstore colleagues and maintain a quality relationship with their host grocer.Such mundane, non-banking chores as knowing how to operate the public addresssystem and learning the location of store merchandise are also important.  Forinstance, it might not be a bad idea to know where various items are locatedin the store-just in case a customer happens to ask.Learning how to read body language is another important skill.  "You shouldknow when the customer wants to be bothered and how long you hold theirattention," he explains.Supermarket bankers may want to provide the same products and services as aconventional branch, but they have to work quicker.  "Because customers don'twant to stand in your lines long and don't have much time, you have to be ableto open checking accounts in five minutes.  You have to be able to providethem with quick loan approvals," Ferris explains.James C Lawson is a Sicklerville, NJ-based business writer.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Technology:  EDS Nabs a Customer at Alltel's ExpenseBy signing a seven-year check-processing contract with EDS Corp., RepublicNational Bank of New York gave Alltel Corp.  the cold shoulder.Alltel had already sold most of its check-processing business to Fiserv Inc.,but it held on to its account with Republic, which dated back to 1993.  TheLittle Rock, AR, company, formerly known as Systematics, put its check unit onthe block early this year after it took a $32-million write-off from a failedinvestment in imaging technology.Fiserv executive vice president Dean Schmelzer would not disclose the amounthis firm paid for Alltel's check business, although an EDS executive put thevalue of his firm's business with Republic at $40 million.  When looked attogether, the two transactions make it clear that the check outsourcingbusiness has boiled down to a two-way competition between EDS and Fiserv.There are other players in this market, including Transys, which is part ofCoreStates Financial Corp., and the Global Processing Alliance, a jointventure between Bankers Trust New York Corp.  and First Fidelity Bancorp.  ButEDS and Fiserv have been the most aggressive at signing up new customers.That aggression is partly driven by a desire to build volume and generateeconomies of scale.  EDS and Fiserv both seem intent on gaining a large enoughclient base to make imaging technology cost-effective."We've made a commitment to provide image capability to our clients," saysSchmelzer.  But in order to make it work, "you've to have the volume."Alltel's inability to deploy image technology successfully isn't discouragingeither EDS or Fiserv from going ahead with their own plans to use imaging,although both data-processing companies will move forward slowly.  It will beat least a year before EDS converts Republic to imaging.  For the time being,EDS will process the New York bank's checks using conventional technology.Two California thrifts for which EDS does item processing, Great WesternFinancial Corp.  and First Nationwide, will be converted to imaging muchsooner, but they have been EDS customers for several years.The problems Alltel ran into make it clear that imaging technology is far morecomplicated than has been acknowledged, but EDS is still confident it willavoid the same mishaps because it is working closely with IBM Corp.  to modifythat supplier's system to its own needs.  The Dallas company is taking anapproach that lets it avoid redesigning its check operations from top tobottom, which is what most imaging installations have called for until now,says Dan Talbott, EDS' vice president for its check operations.Most of EDS' current check-processing system will remain intact, apart from animaging camera that will be inserted into the middle of the operation.  Thedata sent to the mainframe that manages the check shop will look essentiallythe same as it does with a system running conventional technology."What we're doing allows us to leverage our existing platform," Talbott says.If done according to plan, imaging technology will help both firms reducetheir costs, says Fiserv's Schmelzer.  In the hotly competitive outsourcingbusiness, survival is quickly becoming dependent upon being a low-costprovider.A Small Shift Away From Big BusinessThere's been a modest but meaningful increase in the percentage of banks' cashmanagement revenue stemming from small business customers, according to thelatest cash management survey from Ernst & Young.Some 17% of the proceeds in cash management-where banks manage corporations'direct deposit, wire transfer and accounts payable and receivable-came fromsmall businesses in 1994, up slightly from 15% in 1993.Large corporate customers still accounted for a significant plurality of cashmanagement revenue, about 38%, but that figure is off from the 44% theycontributed in 1993.To some extent, this increase could have been anticipated.  In recent years,Fortune 500 firms and other large bank customers have sharply reduced thenumber of banks from which they purchase cash management services, accordingto Larry Forman, a manager with Ernst & Young.  On the other hand, banks haveincreased the number of products suited for their small business clients."Small business has become an important segment," Forman says.This shift is even more pronounced for mid-sized regionals and smaller banks,where small business customers contribute 29% of cash management revenue.  Forthe largest regional and money center banks, small businesses only account for7% of cash management.  These big banks are still heavily dependent upon thebiggest corporate accounts, getting some 46% of their cash management revenuefrom them.  But even for them, that figure is down.  In last year's survey,the industry's behemoths garnered some 50% of their revenue from their largestaccounts.The greater dependence on small businesses helps explain why so many bankshave rushed into the market with cash management software, according to LindaVanadis, an assistant vice president with Boatmen's Bancshares Inc.  The$32-billion-asset St.  Louis regional company is one of several banks that hasbegun marketing a personal computer-based cash management software program inthe last few years.Vanadis says that many small business clients have bought PCs already loadedwith Microsoft Corp.'s Windows for their accounting and other businessfunctions, and many banks have decided that if they are to serve this market,they must sell a cash management system that runs on Windows.Networks' Age And Size Cut Debit Card FeesThe largest debit card networks also have some of the lowest fees, accordingto the latest data book from Debit Card News, a Faulkner & Gray publication.Interlink, the debit card network owned by Visa International, not onlyprocesses 15 million transactions a month, which is by far the largest numberof any network, it also charges a switch fee of only 3 cents a transaction.By comparison, Explore, the next largest network that is owned by the WestCoast automated teller network, Star System Inc.  of San Diego, charges 5cents.  Most of the other large regional networks charge roughly 5 cents to 8cents per transaction."The older the programs are, the more the fees have come down," says ArtClark, a partner with Business Dynamics, a consulting firm in Nyack, NY."It's a function of cost and market pressure.  There's just no way that a POStransaction can carry the same cost" as a check or cash transaction.  Aboutthe only way to entice retailers into accepting debit transactions is to makeelectronic payments less expensive than paper ones.The West Coast was one of the first markets where debit cards were widelyused, and the networks with a heavy concentration of accounts there, Interlinkand Explore, have the lowest fees.  By comparison, networks in the Midwest,such as Cash Station and Magic Line, have some of the highest fees.  Theirhome markets, Illinois and Michigan, were relative latecomers to the debitcard party, adopting this technology several years after the networks inCalifornia and Texas.  Magic Line's switch fee is 13 cents, while CashStation's is 11 cents.Fed Fills Its Technology GapsNow that the Federal Reserve System's massive computer system consolidation isjust about finished, the central bank's Automation Services group has shuffledits organizational structure and hired a former KeyCorp executive as the firstchief information officer in its history.  He will supervise the ninemainframes the Fed runs out of three data centers."In the first few years of FRAS (Federal Reserve Automation Services), therewas a focus on setting the organization up," says Robert Tucker, the Fed's newsenior vice president for computer operations and technical support.  Untillast fall, he had been an executive vice president for Key Services Corp.  inCleveland.Prior to the formation of FRAS in 1992, each of the Fed's 12 district bankshad its own data center.  But the cost of maintaining them was very high, andsince the cost of long-distance telecommunications has dropped sharply, theFed closed nine of the existing centers and created three large ones inRichmond, VA, where FRAS is headquartered; Dallas and East Rutherford, NJ.Tucker, will report to Carl Powell, the Fed's director of automationresources, until Powell retires later this year.Two communications centers are also part of the FRAS network, one in Richmondand another in Chicago.  There are four other groups within the FRASumbrella-support services, administrative services, national network servicesand planning and customer support.Technology is written by Joseph Radigan.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996WashingtonBig Changes At The FDICDon't look for business as usual at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., wherechairman Ricki Helfer is shaking things up bigtime.First and foremost, the agency is shrinking-understandably so fromunrealistically high levels created during the last recession, when failureswere running at a near-record pace.  Helfer says that expenses were to betrimmed 20% in 1995 and staffing was to be cut 14%; altogether, staff levelswill have fallen by more than a third from mid-1993.  She won't predict justwhere core staffing will settle, but says "it will be far less" than it isnow.  In November, the agency announced a buyout program intended to spur 500employees to leave voluntarily."I want to run the FDIC the way a business operates-by striving for greaterproductivity and enhanced performance, by using rigorous cost/benefit analysisand by relying on up-to-date management concepts and technology," Helfer toldthe America's Community Bankers convention in a speech in late October.In a subsequent interview, Helfer said she had brought the FDIC its first-everstrategic and operating plans.  The first is a five-year plan; the latter,which looks out 12 to 18 months, is more flexible and encompasses some 150projects.  "We are viewing the familiar as if we had never seen it before,"she said.The chairman also noted that she is asking staffers to concentrate anew on theability to assess broad risk-not just clean up in its aftermath.  Too oftenthe agency has tended "to look at the trees (individual banks) and not theforest," she argues, adding that it's critical to understand the impact ofstate legislation, regional economic distinctions and rolling recessions.Helfer cheered many in the ACB audience when she promised to reduce theregulatory burden, especially that falling "disproportionately on smallerinstitutions."  Time spent on examinations is dropping as the agency turnsmore to computerization; she said that 10 hours have been trimmed offcompliance exams since last January, and five hours off Community ReinvestmentAct exams.Not surprisingly, there are rumblings that agency morale is less than robustas further job cuts loom.  But Helfer is marching ahead to an ambitiousrefrain.  "We must," she says, "move from the New Deal into the newmillenium."What Does Future Hold For The FHLBS?Just what is the mission of the Federal Home Loan Bank System?  Mostknowledgeable people in Washington would say promoting housing finance.  Butthe chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Board, which oversees theFHLBanks, says that may not turn out to be its role, going forward.Bruce Morrison, who became the FHFB chief last year, says a key role is toprovide "local credit availability in cases where that isn't necessarilyavailable"-in a community where deposits are scant, for instance.  Members ofthe FHLB System routinely use it for advances for housing finance, as well asfor low-cost borrowings."I think the system would be likely to survive as it is, but it would beunder-utilized," he says.  Morrison argues that the system needs "regulatoryroom to develop, and not a narrow blueprint from Congress."  But Republicansin the House, in their budget-trimming zeal, have been eyinggovernment-sponsored ventures like the FHLB System for an amputation, if notoutright execution.Morrison contends that system membership should be fully voluntary-a notionthat pleases thrifts, many of whom have been mandatory members for many years,carrying large FHLB balances as assets on their books.  Commercial banks,however, have been admitted since 1989 as voluntary members, free to come andgo as they wish.The FHFB chairman says the board is in the "bizarre position" of being bothregulator of the system and the statutory issuer of its debt, a position it'strying to extricate itself from.  Meanwhile, the board has been working onways to delegate more management functions to the district banks.  "We'll setthe compliance standards, and they'll determine how" to reach those, he says.A laudable goal.  Now we'll see if Congress goes along and spares the ax.Washington is written by Jeffrey Marshall.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Getting Credit For ProfitsThe industry's strong profitability in recent years has done wonders for bankbalance sheets, not to mention credit ratings.  If you assigned a numericalvalue to every rating on the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.  scale-one forAAA, two for AA+ and so on-the average rating for a bank holding company inthe firm's universe in 1991 was 7.3, or between A- and BBB+.  This average hadimproved to 6.3 (A/A-) by year-end 1993, and to 5.8 by the end of 1994-whichis a good solid A, leaning toward A+.But the pace of upgrades has slowed dramatically since 1992 and 1993, explainsD&P group vice president Charles Orabutt.  D&P upgraded 24 banks in 1992, 15in 1993 and only 12 last year.Realistically, industry balance sheets may be as strong as they're going toget.  A great many institutions are over-reserved for loan losses, and some ofthem have so much excess capital that they've been buying back stock (U.S.Banker, January 1995).  Any further improvements in credit ratings willprobably come from the earnings side, which is where Orabutt and his band ofbank debt analysts have turned their attention for now.  "We're reallyfocusing on business line profitability," he says.  "That's the linchpin tofurther rating upgrades."What businesses does D&P like?  It's keen on consumer lending because it tendsto have higher margins, although Orabutt cautions that banks need to have theright controls in place, since too many of them still try to grow at a 10%rate when the economy only offers 5%.  Orabutt also favorstechnology-intensive, fee-based businesses like check clearing and paymentsprocessing.  And for all the bad press that derivatives have garnered of late,he figures that providing risk management products to end users will also be awinner.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996ATM USAGE EXPLODES IN '95Transaction volume on automated teller machines nationwide shot up 14.6% for a12-month period ending in September 1995, compared to 9.7% in 1994 and only6.9% in 1993.  The deployment of ATMs also grew 11.3% for the year, and whilethis was down from 15% in 1994, it was still the second best performance in adecade.  The gold medal, however, goes to point of sale:  transaction volumeincreased by 37%, while the number of terminals expanded by 47%.  These wereamong the findings of an annual survey of the electronic funds transferindustry conducted by Bank Network News, a twice-monthly newsletter publishedby Faulkner & Gray Inc.Many of the leading ATM networks also posted strong volume gains.  Thecountry's largest network-Star System-reported a 26.4% gain in transactionsfor the 12-month period.Among the factors cited for the strong growth in overall ATM volume was thestrong likelihood that ATM and POS usage tend to feed one another.  "Theconsumer says, 'This card will do everything,'" Tom Bass, president ofWashington-based Exchange network told Bank Network News.  Another possibilityis that a sharp increase in the number of off-premise ATMs is driving thegrowth in those transactions.EFT TRANSACTIONS (in millions)1995 1994 Growth ATMs 807.4 704.5 14.6% POS 64.6 47.2 36.9% Total 872.0 751.716.0% EFT volumeSource:  Bank Network NewsBack to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Internet Security:  The Saga ContinuesThey may get along with each other about as well as House Speaker NewtGingrich and President Clinton, but it seems that Visa International andMasterCard International are once-again talking turkey about a common standardfor protecting payments over the Internet.A September announcement that Visa and Microsoft Corp.  would cooperate indesigning a new standard-leaving MasterCard out in the cold-was apparently allthe result of a misunderstanding.  At least that's what the parties now say.But it seems that at some point there was a disagreement over how thesuppliers of Internet security software would be compensated.  Microsoft wassaid to have wanted 0.4% of the value of all card transactions made throughthe Internet, according to a November story in USA Today.  The same piece alsoalleged that Visa's members, outraged by Microsoft's asking price, forced thecard association back to the bargaining table with MasterCard.But Microsoft never wanted to be paid on that basis, says Mark Kroese, itsdirector of electronic commerce; rather the software giant simply wantsroyalties from software developers that write programs for Internet commerce.This is the same source of revenue that IBM Corp., which is part ofMasterCard's camp, will seek.Spokespeople for both card associations say they never really stoppeddiscussing the issue, but somehow Visa and Microsoft went ahead withannouncing their security standard without MasterCard's participation.  Backin June, the associations had said they would announce a standard together."We never stopped talking, and we're optimistic about" a common standard, saidDavid Melancon, a Visa spokesman.  He also said Visa wouldn't pay Microsoftany transaction fees over the long haul for the security standard, but itmight do so temporarily to cover some development costs.Melancon also said that Visa was never that out of sync with its members."The feedback hasn't been 100% positive" he said, "but it's never 100%positive on anything.  It's not like they made us do a 360 (degree turn)."But William Randle, a senior vice president for Huntington Bancshares Inc.Visa's electronic payments advisory board, says all 22 members of warned theassdociation in the summer of 1994 not to pursue a relationship withMicrosoft.  Visa later changed the makeup of the board and transferredresponsibility for the board to its home banking subsidiary, Visa Interactive.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996The Death Of SpreadTwo years ago, bankers could make a pretty good living using cheap sources offunding to invest in U.S.  Treasury securities.  They didn't have to lend toget an adequate return; they could simply take cheap short-term funds and usethem to buy higher-yielding treasury bonds, while pocketing a nice spread.And here was the real beauty of it all:  A U.S.  Treasury bond has no creditrisk (Washington's six-day shutdown in late mid-November over the budgetimpasse notwithstanding).Those days are long gone, of course.  Lenders have opened the credit spigot somuch since then-especially to consumers-that many people now fret they've beentoo aggressive.  The spread game seems to have officially ended in mid-1995when the yield curve-which is the difference between source of funds like Fedfunds or core deposits and the interest rate on investment securities liketreasuries-took on the appearance of a flat line.  Normally, the yield ontreasuries will be higher than the underlying cost of funds, and this marginbecomes more pronounced the further out you go on the investment spectrum,since a 30-year bond pays a higher rate of interest than a two-year note.Why did the yield curve flatten out?  The Federal Reserve started tighteningshort-term rates in February 1994 and didn't stop until July 1995, when aftera long series of increases it finally cut rates by a modest 25 basis points.Obviously, those increases put fierce pressure on margins from below.  At thesame time-and somewhat ironically-a generally optimistic view of inflation andthe economy helped bring down rates on long-term bonds, which squeezed marginsfrom above.Theodore H.  Tung, Ph.D., chief economist at National City Corp., points outthat 30-year treasuries normally yield at least 1% more than two-year notes,but that spread has now shrunk to 70 basis points.  "Even more unusual is therecent disappearance of the spread between yields on two-year notes and theFed Funds rate," wrote Dr.  Tung in the November 1995 issue of FinancialMarket Outlook, his monthly financial commentary.  "(This) spread has averagedmore than 1% over the past three years."A flat yield curve is bad news for banks-or at least for their investments insecurities.  "Because the cost of funds is so high, there's no spread," Dr.Tung explains.  And this largely explains why lenders became so much moreaggressive in 1995.  As the cost of funds went up, they had to turn tohigher-yielding loans instead.  "That's why you see the industry competing forconsumer loans-especially credit cards," he says.  Cards loans at, say, 10%enable a lender to cover its funding costs and still make a profit.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Loose Change"National Home Ownership Strategy:  Partners in the American Dream," anamalgam of more than 50 housing organizations, continues to press toward itsgoal of raising the national home ownership rate to 67.5% by 2000, from 64.7%today.

The stock quickly soared from its $16offering price, hitting $27 by mid-December.  The company, which raised over$213 million in the offering, called the response "a strong endorsement of theconcept of wholesale mortgage insurance."You won't find many institutional investors crabbing about high CEO salaries,according to a new study by Russell Reynolds Associates, the major recruitingfirm.  Fifty-six percent of those polled voted strongly against limiting suchpay, and nearly all respondents favored tying CEO compensation to companyperformance-letting it ride up, untethered, as long as the corporation and itsstockholders are going with it.Now accepting the American Express card is that most blue-collar of retailoutlets, Wal-Mart.

That would be enough to convince anyone that it's alot easier to bank electronically than in person.  Yet Belden remains devotedto the 49 branches his company owns in small towns along the rural northernand western fringes of New York State."Having the physical geographic presence is key to our strategy," Belden says."We'll look at enhanced ATMs, and we'll look at PC banking.  We view thealternative delivery as a constructive adjunct to what we do in the branches,but we think the branch remains the focus of our strategy."Having a strategy focused on conventional branches was the main reasonCommunity Bank picked up 17 branches holding $450 million in deposits fromChase Manhattan Corp.  last July.  A few months later, the $1.1-billion-assetSyracuse-based company sold three of those branches to NBT Inc., a bankingcompany in Norwich, NY.  Those offices were in Utica, which is well east ofCommunity's geographic market.Of course, central New York state was hardly the only corner of the countrywhere branches were traded like so much horseflesh.  Plenty of banks large andsmall were active in the branch sale business, and few, if any, of them couldbe described as iconoclasts swimming against the electronic banking tide, inwhich increasing waves of transactions are being done by personal computer,automated teller and even the Internet.Rather, they described strategies that were very similar to Belden's-usingATMs, telephones and PCs to offload most simple transactions like deposits,withdrawals and balance transfers.  That leaves branches, and branchpersonnel, available for the personal attention and the sales pitches that canincrease revenue.All told, there were some $23 billion in deposits bought and sold in 1995,according to U.S.  Banker's sixth annual ranking of branch sale advisoryfirms.  Yet two-thirds of that total can be attributed to just one deal.  InSeptember, GreenPoint Financial Corp.  of Flushing, NY, purchased $8.1 billionin deposits from H.F.  Ahmanson Corp.'s New York operations.  J.P.  MorganCo., which advised GreenPoint, and CS First Boston Corp., which advisedAhmanson, each got credit for the full value of the deposits, and as a resultshared first place.  Without that exchange, there would have been only $6.7billion in branch deposits changing hands.  In both 1994 and 1993, about $7.5billion in deposits were bought and sold.Different ClimateThe last three years have been much tamer than the gold rush period of 1990and 1991, when the Resolution Trust Corp.  was unloading thrift branches bythe truckload.  Now that the RTC is for all practical purposes defunct, branchsales seem to be returning to a more predictable level of activity.Interestingly, while most banks are increasing their investments in electronicservices and many banks are shuttering branches, those branches that are puton the block are commanding high prices.In 1995, branch deposits generated a 7.3% premium, according to HovdeFinancial Inc., an investment banking firm in Washington.  The premium is thepercentage of deposits that a purchasing bank must pay the seller.  In 1994,premiums were 5.3%, while from 1991 through 1993 they averaged only 2.6%.The lure of retail branches has steadily increased in the last several years,says Bill Boyan, a vice president at Hovde.  One big reason:  It is muchcheaper to buy an existing branch than to start one up de novo.  For example,Fifth Third Bancorp., which first moved into Cleveland five years ago,announced it would essentially double its Cleveland franchise once it closedon its purchase of 28 branches from First Nationwide Bank, the SanFrancisco-based thrift.Cleveland is a mature market, and there are few available sites for newbranches.  "That factors into the premium," says Robert Niehaus, the executivevice president who runs Fifth Third's affiliate banking groups.  In 1995,Fifth Third paid just a shade over the industry norm, or about 8% for retaildeposits, Niehaus says.Fifth Third was one of the busiest branch acquirers last year.  In addition tothe $17-billion-asset company's September announcement of its deal for theFirst Nationwide offices, it also bought PNC Bank Corp.'s 12 Dayton branchesin May.  In October, it bought NBD Bancorp.'s 25 Ohio branches, and finally inNovember, Fifth Third bought seven Banc One Corp.  branches in Cincinnati.Niehaus justifies the purchases with reasoning that Community Bank's Beldenwould find familiar.  "There are still a significant number of our customerswho want to do face-to-face banking, and secondly it allows us to cross-sellproducts to our customers," Niehaus says.Fifth Third's branch-buying spree underscores the notion that conventionalbranches still have an articulated purpose.  Few banks are more committed toelectronic services than Fifth Third, yet it was willing to pay a premium forbranches in some selected markets.This was also true for Huntington Bancshares Inc., which bought four brancheswith $138 million in deposits from Banc One in Springfield, OH, a community of70,000 people about midway between Dayton and Columbus."Is there still room for a full-service branch?"  Thomas Prendergast, aHuntington senior vice president asks rhetorically.  "Sure there is."Huntington, despite its development of eight "Huntington Access" branches thatrely almost completely upon ATMs and video kiosks, still has more than 340conventional branches in Ohio and seven other states.Complementary MethodsFrom Prendergast's point of view, the purchase of the four Banc Onebranches-two of which were promptly closed upon the deal's completion-hardlyundermines Huntington's commitment to electronic banking.  Rather, each ofHuntington's means of reaching its clientele-whether it's through conventionalbranches, the all-electronic branches, PC banking at home, phone banking orATMs-all complement one another.Prendergast, who is the senior Huntington executive for the Springfieldmarket, simply sees the acquired branches as a means of giving more Huntingtoncustomers more ways to reach the bank.  Now that the bank has six branches inSpringfield, it will open a seventh outlet this year.  This site will not be abranch, however, but a drive-up ATM in a shopping mall.The message that comes through all this buying and selling is that electronicbanking has its purpose, but so does the branch.  More importantly, not onlycan the two co-exist, but managed intelligently, they can complement oneanother.  Despite the growing importance of electronic banking, there are somecommunities where the branch will likely remain the primary means of servingcustomers.For example, few states are as top-heavy with behemoth holding companies asNorth Carolina.  In Charlotte, there are NationsBank Corp.  and First UnionCorp.  Then there's Winston-Salem, where Wachovia Corp.  and Southern NationalCorp.  are based.  Most of them are also among the industry's technologicalelite, with PC banking programs and smart card initiatives that regularly grabheadlines.Yet Triangle Bancorp, an $800-million-asset Raleigh company that does all ofits business in the state, has carved out a nice niche for itself in the ruralcommunities east of Interstate 95.  For the most part, its larger competitorsdo the bulk of their business out of North Carolina, and most of the in-statebusiness they do is based in the large cities in the state's middle andwestern sectors-Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Durham and Greensboro.Triangle bought four Raleigh branches with $55 million in deposits from FirstUnion, and it also purchased three NationsBank branches with deposits of $49million in two small towns in the eastern part of North Carolina."The acquisitions have mostly filled gaps in our markets," says Debra Lee,Triangle's chief financial officer.  "We still consider ourselves a communitybank, and there are a lot of people out there who still want to walk in andsee the place.  That's not saying we're going to open a branch on everycorner, but in our market, we think that's the way to go."If the track record of the last several years is any indication, there will beample demand for branches in 1996.  Many of the outlets put up for sale werethe offspring of in-market mergers, where the selling bank looked to whittleaway some excess capacity once it had completed a major acquisition.  With thecompletion of some very large in-market deals like Chase and Chemical BankingCorp., Fleet Financial Group and Shawmut National Corp., First Chicago Corp.and NBD, there should be an ample supply of branches in several markets aroundthe country.In spite of the demand for some branches, that rapid flurry of consolidationcould create excess supply and cause premiums to fall.  Fifth Third's Niehaussays he's already seen some evidence of that.Despite the lower premiums, it seems there will still be plenty of buyers forbrick-and-mortar, no matter how out-of-date some people might consider them.Old habits die hard-and that's as true for customers as it is for bankers.  AsTriangle's Lee says, "There are still a lot of people who want face-to-faceservice."Branch Sales for 1995/ Banks and ThriftsAdvisory Firm Deals Branches Sold Deposits ($Mil)J.P.

The process was something like a dance, says CEOHarry P.  Doherty-in reality, more like a lurching tango than a minuet.When executives at the mutual first approached the New York State BankingDepartment for approval to buy Gateway, a stock commercial bank, they got a"you can't do that" reaction.  Pressed as to why not, Doherty relates,department officials "called back a half-hour later" to say they couldn't findanything in the statutes to stop it, but a mutual buying a stock company just"had never been done before."The deal did get done at 1.5 times book, adding about $300 million to thesavings bank's asset base, now $1.7 billion.  Doherty says some Gatewaystockholders were perplexed that they'd be getting cash and not stock-in fact,a few even asked if the closing could be delayed past Jan.  1 for tax reasons.It wasn't.Doherty insists SISB plans to remain a mutual.  As a stock institution, "wewouldn't last long," he says, alluding to "the life expectancy of a mayfly."For those who aren't fisherman or entomologists, the adult mayfly usuallyexpires within 48 hours.  An exaggeration, perhaps, but worth noting.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Commentary/ Trust:  Preparing for The Prudent Investor RuleThe law of investment management for fiduciaries is in the midst of a majorrevision.  The change is based on a revolution in financial theory which haslong been embraced by the markets, but until recently ignored by the law.The Prudent Man Rule is gradually being replaced by a new statutory standard,the Prudent Investor Rule.  The new rule is intended to free fiduciaries fromrigid and outdated investment practices and to allow them to use the fullarray of tools available in the modern investment world for the selection andmanagement of an investment portfolio.The cost of this freedom is a greater responsibility in the selection andmanagement of portfolios.  The fiduciary must make those selections that areappropriate for each particular trust.  What is prudent for one trust may beimprudent for another.  The new rule is liberating in many respects but moredemanding in others than the old rule.  The prudent fiduciary and its legaladvisers must therefore have a full understanding of the broad ramificationsof this revision.The revision is intended to bring trust law into accordance with the practiceof the investment management industry generally, which has been shaped by fourdecades of important academic research as to the optimal methods of investmentmanagement.  These theories and insights are generally referred to as "modernportfolio theory."  At least 11 states have enacted some version of thePrudent Investor Rule, as shaped by the American Law Institute in its 1992Restatement (Third) of Trusts, and the National Conference of Commissioners onState Laws in its 1994 Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA).  They are:California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Washington, NewYork, Illinois and Florida.  It is expected that most other states will soonmove to this standard as well.Modern Portfolio TheoryTwo of the cornerstones of modern portfolio theory can be reduced to timelessadages.  "Nothing ventured, nothing gained" emphasizes that the other side ofrisk is reward.  The market offers bigger rewards (and penalties) for theunknown than for predictability.  "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"emphasizes the critical importance of diversification of investments.Under modern portfolio theory, economists and sophisticated marketparticipants look at risk differently than the traditional prudent fiduciaryinvestor.  Risk is a recognition of the uncertainty of future values.  It is atwo-sided coin with an upside and a downside.The theory assumes that all investors desire the highest possible level ofreturn while bearing the lowest amount of risk.  Economists assume a certainbaseline for risk-free investors-the return on U.S.  Government securities.Since the Treasury rate can be had without risk, the market forces anadditional return for the assumption of risk beyond Treasury risk.  Aninvestor cannot beat this return unless he is willing to assume an additionallevel of risk.  Risk appetites will vary according to the circumstances, butno one gets rich investing at the risk-free Treasury rate.  While assumingrisk does not guarantee riches, it is the only means for an investor toparticipate in market returns greater than the baseline.Modern portfolio theory is concerned not with risk alone but with therelationship between risk and reward.  Investors must inject an element ofrisk into their investments in order to be successful.  Since the marketcompensates investors for accepting greater risk, investors will thereforesearch for those opportunities which offer the greatest reward relative to therisk assumed.  While investors must accept the risk of a particular investmentin order to have the opportunity to gain the compensation for such risk, aportfolio of diversified investments has less overall risk than a singleinvestment.  Diversification reduces the overall variability of theperformance-which is to say, risk-of an investment portfolio since investmentstend not to all react the same if selected to minimize covariance.Covariance is the tendency of certain investments to behave the same.  A crashof technology stocks is likely to drag down most technology stocks, just asmost technology stocks last fall benefited from a bull market.  A portfoliocomposed of a mix of different investments will therefore be more diversifiedthan one which is concentrated in certain types of investments.  A portfoliocomposed of Chrysler, General Motors and Ford will have more covariance thanone composed of Citicorp, General Electric and Coca-Cola.The focus of modern portfolio theory, then, is on portfolio selection ratherthan on individual asset selection.  Diversification is important both withinand across different types of assets.  Risk can be judged only within thecontext of the whole portfolio.The common law rule regarding investment by fiduciaries has historically beenquite restrictive.  Investment in common stocks by fiduciaries is a relativelynew development, having been viewed as per se imprudent until the 1940s.Until that time fiduciaries were generally restricted by statute to "legallists" which specified permissible fixed- income investments.  The collapse ofbond values in the Depression led to the adoption of Prudent Man Rule statutesin most states.Interestingly, these statutes were based almost verbatim on the language of an1830 Massachusetts case, Harvard College v.  Amory:  "In acquiring, investing,reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing property for thebenefit of another, a fiduciary shall exercise the judgment and care, underthe circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, andintelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard tospeculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds,considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of theircapital."While seemingly a timeless statement setting forth a flexible yet accountablestandard, Prudent Man Rule statutes were interpreted by the courts as actuallysetting forth a Prudent Trustee standard, in the belief that a Prudent Manwould be justified in taking risks in his own investments that would beinappropriate for a prudent fiduciary.  Caution and conservative selection ofinvestments became the hallmarks of the Prudent Man Rule.The interpretations of the Prudent Man Rule statutes have no tolerance forspeculation.  The old rule emphasizes the duty to "preserve principal" at allcosts.  A loss of capital can have catastrophic consequences for a fiduciary.A fiduciary can become a guarantor of risky investments, even if it picks manymore winners than losers.  Each investment is considered on its own merits,without regard to the rest of the portfolio.  Broad categories of investmentsare considered as imprudent per se.  A fiduciary investing in growth stocks,start-ups, options and futures might face a surcharge action if those assetsdepreciate.Under the Prudent Man Rule, delegation of investment authority by a fiduciaryis generally forbidden.  Thus, even if a fiduciary is selected for goodrelationship reasons rather than for investment expertise, the fiduciary ispersonally responsible for all investment decisions, regardless of his levelof expertise-although he is free to seek advice.The Prudent Investor RuleAs modern portfolio theory became almost universally accepted in economics andinvestment management, the law lagged behind.  In acknowledgement of thisproblem, the trust bar began a comprehensive review process that resulted inthe Prudent Investor Rule.  The objective was to articulate a standard whichallows various sound investment strategies, yet is flexible enough to adapt tothe inevitable changes in the markets.  It also imposes a meaningful duty ofprudence and care on fiduciaries, forcing them to take steps to serve theinterests of settlors and beneficiaries rather than relying on traditionalinvestment practices that had as a principal benefit a safe harbor fromliability for the fiduciary.  Interestingly, the Prudent Investor Rule is inmany ways a return to the flexible standard of the original Harvard Collegerule.The heart of the Prudent Investor Rule is a focus on the portfolio as a wholerather than on specific investments.  The rule recognizes that the key job ofthe fiduciary is to determine the tradeoff between risk and return necessaryto realize the trust objectives.  The rule abolishes categoric restrictionsand disavows the emphasis in prior law on avoiding "speculative" or "risky"investments.  Delegation is permitted, even encouraged.The Prudent Investor Rule is a standard of conduct.  Liability is not based onthe performance of investments if the fiduciary takes informed and thoroughactions in its investment selection.  It is process-oriented rather thanresult-oriented.  In this sense it is somewhat similar to the businessjudgment rule of corporate law.  A process-oriented rule puts a continuousburden on the fiduciary, who can no longer rely on rules of thumb.  Thefiduciary must analyze each situation and make a decision which is prudentunder the circumstances.  Under the Prudent Investor Rule, there is verylittle that is per se prudent or imprudent.  The rule does not, however,abandon trust law's favor of conservative investing.  It does, however,require a fiduciary to justify whatever investments it makes, whether inTreasury bills or derivatives.The major points of the Prudent Investor Rule statutes are as follows:* The standard of prudence applies to the trust as a whole rather thanindividual investments, with a realization that particular investments thatwould have been seen as surchargeable speculations under old law may besensible, perhaps even risk-reducing additions to a portfolio viewed as awhole.  * The overall investment strategy should be based upon risk-and-rewardobjectives suitable for the trust.  These objectives will vary widely,depending on the circumstances in each trust arrangement.  * There is a dutyto diversify unless the fiduciary reasonably determines that it is in theinterests of the beneficiaries not to diversify, taking into account thepurposes and terms of the governing instrument.  * No particular investment isinherently prudent or imprudent.  * No special status is accorded to originalinvestments received by the fiduciary, and the fiduciary must review themwithin a reasonable time of receipt.  * Delegation is permitted, encouragedand in some cases required.  The Prudent Investor Rule reverses the PrudentMan Rule's anti-delegation bias.Impact on Trust DepartmentsIn many respects, the new rule will not change the decision-making process ofmost bank trust departments when determining investments.  Most placesignificant emphasis on the diversity of assets in the trust portfolio and tryto balance growth and yield to make their investments meet the needs of allthe trust's beneficiaries.  And most understand that their care in the processof making choices-and not the actual performance of the assets chosen-is thebasis on which they will be judged.  Furthermore, trust departments arealready familiar with provisions of the Prudent Man Rule statutes that holdthe professional trustee to a higher standard of skill than thenon-professional, a concept carried over to the Prudent Investor Rule as well.Nevertheless, the Prudent Investor Rule, because of its emphasis on theportfolio as a whole and on the interplay between risk and reward, is a moredynamic standard and requires consideration of more factors in makinginvestment choices.  The fiduciary must determine an investment strategy forthe entire trust portfolio, and be able to justify and document both thereasonableness of that strategy and the prudence of each investment in lightof that strategy.  The strategy, furthermore, must protect the real value, asopposed to the historic value, of the trust principal while providing for asuitable return for the income beneficiary.  As a result, the strategy willnecessarily change over time, depending on changes in the economy, individualinvestments and the needs and resources of the trust's beneficiaries.To ensure that the necessary work has been done to review all the relevantconsiderations, trust departments will need to establish consistent proceduresto gather and record basic factual information about the family needs andfinances, not only at the trust's inception, but on an ongoing basis.  Thesame applies to general analysis of the economy and performance of theinvestments.  Trust instruments will have to be analyzed carefully as to theirterms because powers to invade (or the absence of such powers) and precatorylanguage will take on heightened meaning under the new standard.  Recordsshould be maintained of the considerations and decisions resulting in aparticular strategy or investment.The burdens on a trust department resulting from increased inquiry andrecord-keeping may well be offset by the opportunities for increased contactwith family members and their input into the decision-making process.New Opportunities, New RisksThe Prudent Investor Rule permits and even encourages unsophisticated trusteesto delegate investment decisions to professionals.  As a result, assetinvestment departments of banks and trust companies will likely find more callfor their services to individual fiduciaries.Many fiduciaries also will chose to meet the requirements of diversificationand risk assumption by participating in mutual funds.  In another area, banksin Prudent Investor Rule states are now providing specific sophisticatedservices to trustees, such as risk-management derivatives or review andoversight of family assets.There are a great many unknown areas in the application of the PrudentInvestor Rule.  It cannot be predicted how easily the courts will move awayfrom the more clear-cut standards of the Prudent Man Rule when faced withactual lawsuits, or how they will reevaluate the fiduciary's decisions yearsafter they were made.  Other important issues include the extent of thetrustee's duty of affirmative due diligence to inquire about familycircumstances, and the scope of liability of the investment advisor.In addition, it is not clear how the Prudent Investor Rule interacts withother existing laws which have not been-and may not be-modified to fit itsconcerns.  For example, under-productive property rules in many states requireeach asset of a trust to produce a minimum amount of income to avoidallocation of a portion of that asset's proceeds to the trust's incomebeneficiary.  This is not consistent with the total return analysis of thePrudent Investor Rule.  Other portions of state income and principal acts mayalso be troublesome.  Furthermore, the effect of the Prudent Investor Rule onpension trusts and charitable trusts and corporations that are regulated byspecific state or federal statutes has not been fully explored.  Indeed,fiduciaries will be acting in a realm of uncertainty for some time to come.Bernard Karol and M.

Included is a notice that her credit limit isbeing raised, and a reminder that its purchase protection plan offers pricesavings if an item she buys is being sold more cheaply later.Halfway across the world in steamy Singapore, an export executive returns tohis sleek apartment to find a different Citibank mailing, an offer for a cardtied to a frequent flyer program for Asian travelers.From Bangkok to Bangor, and sundry points in between, the Citibank credit cardis proving itself to be truly a worldwide brand, with a scope that's sometimesstartling.  Citi issues secured cards and even private-label cards in Brazil,frequent flyer cards in Argentina and Taiwan.  In many countries, Citibank andDiners Club-the travel and entertainment card of which Citi is the primaryowner-are the chief consumer card brands.  Citibank processes more than 240million card payments and has 90 million card customer contacts a year.  Itsoverseas executives don't need to brush up on Portuguese or Thai; likely asnot, they're natives.More than any other American bank-and arguably any bank-Citibank is a nameplayer in an array of overseas markets.  Long-established operations in Europeand Latin America weren't shucked off some years ago, the way they were atseveral other money center banks when profitability was squeezed.  Underchairman John S.  Reed, parent Citicorp has made servicing the global consumera veritable mantra-and the credit card business is perhaps the biggest weaponin its arsenal.It is precisely this unparalleled reach that should keep Citi at the top ofthe credit card receivables heap.  Nimble, aggressive issuers like MBNA Corp.,First USA Inc.  and Advanta Corp.  have used a precision-bombing approach ontop credit targets to build U.S.  market share dramatically, and they'll keepgaining share-but less so at Citi's expense than other large issuers.  Even ifthe New York behemoth finds its domestic lead shrinking, its plethora ofrelatively untapped overseas programs-some with explosive growthpotential-should preserve its top ranking."We believe that Citicorp is in a unique position to build upon itsmultinational credit card experience in entering new markets, dealing withtheir cultural differences and developing relevant products-even where creditbureaus or other information sources are nonexistent," wrote Salomon Brothersanalyst Diane Glossman in a report last fall.Citi's card operations may be its crown jewel, analysts say; plastic generatesa higher percentage of the bank's earnings than any other bank issuer's cardsdo, and accounted for an estimated 29% of the bank's net income inthird-quarter 1995, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  It's a jewel cutand honed by many years of large-scale marketing, telephone account servicingand experimentation with differing offers.  Citi was among the pioneers in thepurchase protection plan area, as well as extended warranties.  ItsCitidollars program, offering catalog items to customers as a form of rebates,also broke new ground years ago.In the spring of 1994, this gem was placed in the hands of Roberta J.  Arena,a 20-year Citi veteran who had most recently headed Citi's relatively smallEuropean card operations.  As executive vice president in charge of the NorthAmerican and European card group, Arena replaced James L.  Bailey, the bank'slongtime card honcho.  Citibank declined to make Arena available for aninterview for this story, but industry observers say her experience outsidethe U.S.  is underscoring Citi's commitment to pushing its global strategyeven further.At a time when headlines in the U.S.  are trumpeting worries about mountingconsumer credit troubles, foreign markets may offer a useful counterweight.Historically, Citicorp's card-loss numbers have been slightly worse thanindustry averages because of its targeting of what Glossman calls "ahigh-risk, high-return clientele."  Citi's U.S.  loss experience, however, haschanged little; at 3.72% of managed card receivables in the third quarter, itactually improved two basis points from the second quarter and was up just 15basis points from third-quarter 1994.Moreover, KBW research finds that cards represented just over half of Citi'snet chargeoffs in the third quarter-53%-compared to 74% at Bank of New York,75% at Chemical Bank, 87% at Chase Manhattan and 99% at First Chicago.  Still,Citi has been boosting its provision for credit losses in the global consumerbank.  That item hit $465 million in the third quarter, up $100 million fromthe year-earlier number.Credit the bank with seeing the trendlines.  "As the largest credit cardissuer in the country, we think it will be impossible for Citicorp to avoidconcerns about credit cards' credit quality," noted PaineWebber's LawrenceCohn in a recent report.Citi's card prominence dates to the virtual dawn of the bank card in the early1970s, and at this juncture its card is a very mature product in this country.There's a bit of consumer ennui about the brand, perhaps, which will be achallenge for Arena and her marketing forces.  So, too, will be catering tothe more service-savvy customer and finding the proper alchemy of rates andrewards to keep profitability high amid fierce competitive pressures.The legacy of leadership is certainly there.  "They reached a milestone in thelate 1970s when they realized that the card was the beachhead of leastresistance," says a consultant who worked for the bank years ago.  "They gaveup trying to be a national bank."Very early on, they decided the card business should be done on a volumebasis," he adds, and began multimillion-piece mailings.  "Even though Citi wasrealizing significantly higher loan losses than the industry norms, by goingafter active credit users, where the profits are, they were making morebecause those people aren't as sensitive to rates and fees.  (Citi) acceptedcredit losses as a cost of goods sold.  They also realized that they had agreat list, and they crammed everything they could sell down that pipeline."Reputation as a Bully"Cram" implies an element of bullying-and Citicorp still occasionally getsdemonized by consumer groups and smaller banks as the apotheosis of impersonalservice and a Marie Antoinette-in-pinstripes, "let-them-eat-cake" response tocriticism.  Some of that reflects a kind of Jeffersonian revulsion to bigness,but Citi earned a lot of enmity in thev '70s and '80s, when it seemed eager tobulldoze any regulation or law in its path.But a seemingly chastened Citi-burned by waves of LDC, leveraged buyout andcommercial real estate losses in the late '80s and early '90s-is keeping alower profile these days.  It's no longer the merger scourge that smallerbanks once saw in their nightmares; institutions like NationsBank Corp.  andFirst Union Corp.  have taken over that mantle.  As Citi has turned rightfull-rudder into consumer banking, it's often been reducing fees (especiallyfor electronic services), not just jacking them up.If Citi's consumer banking business isn't hitting on all cylinders, it'sclose:  It generated over $500 million in global earnings in the thirdquarter, a new high-water mark and 60% of the company's net income.  That'sbroad-based, but the credit card is the biggest arrow in the quiver.  Citireported 56 million cards in circulation at the end of the third quarter, up9% from the year earlier, with managed receivables up 19%.  Growth wasespecially strong in the Asia-Pacific region, where managed receivables surged40%, year-to-year, and applications hit a record level.  Since 1990, worldwidecards in force have swelled more than 50%.It's a big business, Citicorp's largest, and it requires hordes ofpeople-6,400 alone in three service centers in South Dakota, Maryland andNevada (Citi has offered 24-hour, 7-day phone service for almost a decade).Throw in the operations in 31 other countries, and 14,300 employees areinvolved-more bodies than the entire workforce at most large regional banks.It's hard to downplay scale and experience in a business like credit cards.In a recent survey of senior bank executives and directors by Towers Perrin,Citibank was named most often as the best product manufacturer and distributorin banking-attributes at the heart of card programs.  "The fact that Citi hasplayed at this level year in and year out is a remarkable thing," says AngeloPalombi, senior executive vice president at Resource Bancshares Corp., aColumbia, SC, firm that helps smaller banks run card operations.For many years, Citi has been using scoring and portfolio modeling, thenblanketing the country with mail pieces, often with pre-approved applicationsbased on statistics and credit report data.  True, Citi doesn't know thecustomer in Oshkosh as well as the local bank, and never will.  But the creditcard business is a scale-enhanced one in which it's increasingly impracticalto lend just locally.  Think Advanta and MBNA aren't using sophisticatedcredit scoring techniques?  Think again.  Citi is using its technologicalprowess to segment its marketing efforts and boost responsiveness, as well asbuild average card balances.With $42.1 billion in receivables at the end of 1995's third quarter, Citi'sprogram was half again as large as second-place Discover's $28.2 billion,according to RAM Research.  MBNA, First USA and First Chicago rounded out thetop five (see table on this page).  Citi held 23.4% of total receivables forthe 10 largest issuers.Several money-center analysts put its return on assets on its U.S.  cardbusiness around 2.5%.  KBW's Berry says the business "continues to generatesuperior returns," though Salomon Brothers' Glossman predicts returns willtrend down toward 2.0% over time.  That 2.5% ROA is double what aggressive"pure-play" issuers Capital One Financial Corp.  (1.20%) and Advanta (about1.30% on receivables made up 80% of credit cards) reported in the thirdquarter.  Revenues would be even more impressive if Citi could develop bettercross-sell numbers; only 6% of the card base has another Citibankrelationship, and only half of branch customers have a Citi card, saysGlossman.Profitability has received renewed attention, and that seems to be paying off."Historically, they were more aggressive and more sophisticated than any otherissuers," says K.  Shelly Porges, president of Porges/Hudson Marketing in SanFrancisco.  But "they did not focus exclusively on revolving customers (thosewho carry balances)-that would have made them more profitable.  They were outthere to gain total share."Citi clearly isn't as dominant as it was a few years ago.  Its share of U.S.credit card receivables slipped from 18% in 1991 to 13.5% at the end of 1994,according to Credit Card Management, a Faulkner & Gray publication.  RAMnumbers put its Sept.  30, 1995 share even lower, at 12.8%.Yet it's hard to underplay the importance of cards in Citi's earnings stream.The bank reported 24.8 million bank card accounts in September 1995, and cardloans made up 23% of Citi's bankwide loans, up from 21% a year earlier; onlyFirst Chicago (41%) had a higher percentage among major bank issuers.Visa and MasterCard cards make up the vast majority of those accounts, butCiti has issued some seven million Diners Club cards, and also issues andservices millions of private-label cards for department stores.  In the 1950s,Diners was the travel and entertainment card for U.S.  corporations.  That's adistinction it has lost-American Express is now six times as large, worldwide.But Diners recorded its fourth straight record sales year in 1994, withworldwide revenues of $22 billion in more than 175 countries.Citi's ownership of the 45-year-old Diners brand is complex-Citi may havecontrol in various countries or share it with local franchisees.  It owns thefranchise in Germany, for instance, but In Chile has only a 20% share.  Dinersclaims relationships with more than half of the Fortune 500 corporations, butskeptics say it lives more on its past reputation than anything, and has moreclout in Europe in Asia than in the U.S.  "They haven't exploited Diners tothe point they can," says Michael Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consultingin Westbury, NY.  "The energy and the effort seem to be missing."But Porges points out that Citi has been developing new marketing for Diners-aclear sign that it is committed to the program.  New commercials featureyounger, hipper travelers and an updated focus on women, she says.  In arecent full-page ad in major newspapers, Diners takes on American Express,calling Diners' "membership miles" program superior because it includes "everymajor U.S.  airline"-including two Amex leaves out.Big SwitchAnalysts attribute Citi's relative passivity on the marketing front in 1991-93to its internal problems, many related to real estate loan losses.  That wasalso a period when Citi's card chargeoffs peaked, climbing to over 6% in1991-92, according to KBW.  Yet card profits, as well as those from otherconsumer businesses, helped pull the bank from the ditch it had landed in fiveyears ago.The 1992 switch to variable rates and the year-end 1993 decision to eliminateannual fees for Citibank Classic and Preferred Visa and MasterCard customerswith good credit histories sacrificed what some analysts estimated washundreds of millions of dollars in revenues.  But it clearly gave Citi's cardprogram a shot in the arm.  "Repricing is restoring our momentum," Arenaannounced in 1994.  In an interview last year with Brandweek magazine, shesaid, "We invested more than we had planned in sheer marketing last year(1994)...  so I think it's fair to say that we are back."In its latest annual report, Citi said the steps were taken "to reinforce itsmarket dominance by building customer loyalty in this highly competitivemarket."  Adding customers was a key objective.  Early in 1995, for instance,the bank was offering new customers an introductory fixed rate of 6.9% for 12months, considerably longer than most rivals.Frank DeSantis, money-center analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, addsthat Citi has identified active customers who have $50 billion in balances onother issuers' cards-and is targeting these accounts with balance-transfersolicitations.  Its goal, he says, "is to regain half its lost market shareover the next five years."  Earlier last year, DeSantis singled out Citi'susage levels, citing the figure of 79% of all accounts active (vs.  66%industrywide) and higher-than-average balances per active account, $2,150 vs.the $1,750 industry average.  Moreover, he says that the company's credit cardexpense control "borders on spectacular"-recently, it was operating at a 34%efficiency ratio in the U.S.Citi has been "coming to terms with things that were part of its heritage,"says Porges.  Citidollars, for instance, which was discontinued a year and ahalf ago.  When it was introduced in the early '80s, Citidollars "had a lot ofpower," she says.  "But in an age of co-branded cards, Citidollars had littleif any appeal."The U.S.  portfolio has been highly segmented, offering consumers an array ofchoices:  Classic (security and value); Preferred (higher credit line);Choice, for price-sensitive buyers; and co-branded programs with such majorpartners as American Airlines, Ford Motor Co.  and Apple Computer.  Anothersuccessful selling strategy is the Photocard, in which the cardholder's photois digitally imprinted on the face of the card-a genuine security advantagethat Citi says cut its U.S.  bank card fraud losses by 62% in 1993-94.Introduced in the U.S.  in 1992, it has been rolled out in all European,Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets.But the bank has hit a few pockets of major turbulence, too.  Its co-brandedcard with MCI Communications was killed last year when consumers just didn'tline up.  And the Ford card, announced with a flourish three years ago, isrumored in the industry to have collected most of its accounts from elsewherein Citi's empire, not from new customers.Some attribute those difficulties to a focus on Citi's own brand, givingco-branding programs-in which the bank shares proceeds with a nonbank-a lowerpriority.  "The focus on the brand is an excellent strategy, but I think forsomething that large they should have a two-pronged approach," says Auriemma."They're not focusing on some of the non-branded programs that might havetremendous potential."Great ExpectationsWhere issuers like MBNA and Household Bank have had tremendous success withco-branded programs, the only one that has really clicked at Citi is theAmerican Airlines frequent flyer, or AAdvantage, experts say.  It's done sowell that it's been exported throughout Latin America.  But the otherprograms?"The Apple program ought to be huge, but I don't know one person that carries(that card)," Auriemma says.  Similarly, he says never got an MCI cardsolicitation, even though he was an MCI customer; he believes that's becauseCiti is concentrating on its branded cards in the greater New York market.Says Porges:  "When we talk about success in co-branding, the expectation isthat (Citi) would have something as big or bigger than anyone else's.  By thatstandard, they weren't successful."  She quickly adds that this doesn't meanthe programs are failures, however.On the flip side, Citi's own brand recognition is a huge asset-and coupledwith the bank's far-flung presence, it offers breathtaking potential.  Citiissues bank cards in Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain-and believes aco-branded arrangement with the German national railway could catapult it tofirst place there.  Plans are to consolidate the 15 card processing andcustomer service facilities in North America and Europe into a small core ofcentralized operations, trimming costs.Asia, where Citi has a stronger presence than any other American bank, is itsmost turbocharged card market.  Four million cards are in force there, andCiti recently partnered with Passages, Asia's biggest frequent-flyer program,in seven countries.  Arena has said that the credit card "is the biggestintroductory agent we have for the (Citibank) brand."Even Eastern Europe, where capital infrastructures are still being built fromthe rubble of Communism, holds card potential-though it may be a ways off.Citi is in such countries as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Russia.Salomon Brothers' Glossman noted in a recent report that Citi's EasternEuropean operations "have been profitable from day one...  These economiestend to be almost completely cash-dependent, and Citicorp is well-positionedshould development skip checks and move straight to credit/debit/stored valuecards."Some observers wonder just how quickly these emerging markets can deliver,however.  "It is important to develop them, but those markets are so small andso immature that to spend a significant portion of management time on them isdangerous, I think," Auriemma says.  "You certainly wouldn't want to do it tothe detriment of the U.S.  market."Even in many highly developed areas in western Europe, there's plenty ofopportunity.  A New York banker with close ties to a large Dutch bank saysthat many bankers there don't understand the popularity of credit cards inthis country; there, they've focused far more on debit cards-leaving anautobahn-like opening for a high-volume card issuer like Citi.In a number of overseas markets, Citi doesn't have to import its U.S.  cardlogic, notes John Laurino, managing director at Westport Consulting inWestport, CT.  "It has built retail businesses from the ground up, and theyare as well-established as they are in the States."  In fact, some of itsproducts in this country "were explored and validated overseas and broughtback here."  Citi calls that process "success transfer."Success isn't necessarily measured in terms of customer satisfaction, however.Citi tied for fifth in a recent U.S.  card satisfaction survey by J.D.  Power& Co., long noted for its automotive surveys.  Power measured such attributesas billing payment quality, interest rates, rewards and fees, cash advancelimits and point-of-sale processing quality.  Citi's score of 101-100 wasdeemed average-tied it with Banc One.  Only one multiline bank scored higher,Bank of New York at 102.  AT&T Universal Card led the pack, followed byDiscover and Household Bank.In a RAM rating of the "best" consumer cards, Citi doesn't score in the topgroup in any category except "best secured cards," where it was third behindWachovia Corp.  and Chase Manhattan.  But its move to eliminate annual feeshelps boost consumer satisfaction-though Citi, like most fee-charging issuers,was dragged into those waters by a horde of no-fee rivals who were clearlymaking big inroads.Service QuestionsService quality issues remain, some customers say.  One customer with aCitigold account-a packaged account that requires an opening minimum of$100,000 and brings with it such goodies as a personal account officer, fundssweep and trading privileges-complains that he's had difficulty with the bankacknowledging separate accounts.  When he ran over his limit on a plainvanilla card, he says, the card service people apparently never realized hewas a Citigold customer.  "From a customer perspective, (the card business)seems to be managed autonomously from the retail bank," he says.  Thatexperience highlights the difficulty of managing information over massivenetworks, but for an institution with Citi's technological prowess, it'sdisconcerting nonetheless.Technology does appear to be paying dividends, however, in keepingdelinquencies and losses in line.  As consumer loan delinquencies have shot upin recent months, Citi's numbers have held up well.  Moreover, Lehman Brothersanalyst James Rosenberg maintains that even if Citi's U.S.  consumerchargeoffs (including cards) jumped 100 basis points, that would extract atmost a 10% toll on earnings.  Similarly, KBW's Berry notes that Citi's $1.8billion in consumer loan-loss reserves (most allocated for card losses)represented 17 months of recent losses-far more than the seven months'reserves that specialty card banks usually carry.But it's incontrovertible:  cards are riskier than, say, home equity loans.Citi's overall loss rate of 2.02% for all managed consumer loans at thethird-quarter close compares to 3.78% for worldwide credit card loans.Risk management is a tough nut for issuers, and so is consumer loyalty at atime of intense competition on the issuer's version of the Three R's:  rates,rebates and rewards.  It's estimated that a record three billion credit cardoffers were mailed out in 1995 alone.  "In the last 10 years, customer loyaltyto credit cards (in the U.S.)  has been destroyed, as holders were saturatedwith offers," says Robert Skolnick, executive vice president at BehavioralAnalysis Inc.  in Tarrytown, NY.  "Issuers have turned credit cards into acommodity in consumers' minds, and now they are launching major efforts todevelop long-term relationships, which historically had been presumed."That's every major issuers' story; it is Citi's, too.  Growth potential inthis country is circumscribed by such commoditization, but it isn't strangled,especially if current cardholders can be coaxed to build their balances.Berry thinks Citi's card program can maintain its domestic share even asoverall credit card receivables mount at a 14%-16% annual clip through therest of the decade.  Roping in a new group-maybe even a new generation-ofcustomers is a key cog in that effort.Arena told Brandweek that the student market is one of Citi's four majormarketing thrusts, the others being high-end spenders, "new Americans" and"the great magic middle," which she said "is best characterized as beingmarried, or something, with children."  That great middle, she added, is whereCiti is "focusing our marketing weight."In developing markets, far from the U.S.' saturated shores, growth could becomparatively luxuriant.  "Adding new countries, improving penetration inexisting countries and increased usage of credit cards as a payment vehicle inthe locations are all sources of growth," wrote Glossman recently.  "Citicorpalready has enviable positioning in many of these markets with a known brandname and the ability to draw upon its U.S.  and international skill base."For instance, Citi recently introduced its American AAdvantage card in fournew markets-Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Panama.Obviously, the developing world offers risk with a capital "R."  But Glossman,who has exhaustively analyzed the bank's card operations, offers aninstructive example of Citi's experience in Colombia.  While savings banksthere have seen delinquency rates shoot as high as 25%, Citi's recently stoodat 4.4%.  Citi "has the advantage of centralized scoring, collections and moretargeted marketing," she noted.  One result:  Citi grew its credit card bookin Colombia by 116% in the first half of 1995, she says.No Alarm BellsDomestically, Citi can expect to see a modest uptick in delinquencies ifcurrent trends hold-but nothing alarming.  Card executives at other banksdon't profess serious concern.  "Our forecasted losses are within ourexpectations," says John A.  Klein, executive vice president for consumerbanking at People's Bank in Bridgeport, CT, which has a national low-rateportfolio.  "They continue to track in a way we would expect with thevintaging of our account base."Another executive with a regional issuer attributes today's delinquency risemore to the economic cycle than to a lack of portfolio "seasoning" over time."We're seeing people claiming bankruptcy who are not even past due.  That debtis not showing up at the credit bureaus."  Still, he says that "mostsuccessful players don't stop issuing in these markets, and the big guys likeCiticorp know that."What's driving the most successful operations in this era of card saturationis the ability to assemble information electronically and use it to maintainthe most profitable customer relationships, says James Quella, head of thefinancial services practice at Mercer Management Consulting.  Citi continuesto reinvest heavily in the card business, adding client-server and voiceresponse technologies, and Glossman insists its current cost-per-account levelis what it was in 1982.  In a 1993 study by Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Citi'scost advantage in the back office over other major card players ranged from10% to 60%.An executive with a regional card issuer says he heard that a few years ago,Citi explored a mutual opening of back offices with First Data Corp.  Suchovertures, in which companies check out each other's technology, don't alwayslead to ventures, and he says "Citi is notorious for stealing ideas."  Afterthat process, he says, "Citi felt it had perhaps the best cost structure" inthe business.  Being a low-cost producer has conferred tremendous advantagesby freeing up resources for new marketing and technology initiatives.While Citi hasn't been duking it out in the courts far and wide as it was inthe 1970s and 1980s, it isn't loath to fight to protect its interests.  Thebank recently challenged a New Jersey law limiting late fees to $10 per cardaccount each month; Citi charges its customers $15.  The New Jersey SupremeCourt upheld the state limit in late November, and Citi immediately vowed toappeal.It's clear that Citi doesn't have the pre-eminent role it once did in the cardbusiness; too many other talented players have come in.  But Citi is no NormaDesmond, either, living only on past glories.  Freed from its earlier assetwoes and focused on the global consumer, it is in the process of erecting aworldwide brand it hopes will rival Coca-Cola or Hewlett-Packard.When that exporter in Singapore weighs his options for a card, that namerecognition and the image of Citi's four-pointed star will be no smallconsideration.  So, too, will it weigh considerably with a manufacturingexecutive in Germany.  Citi expects to grow its European card business to fivemillion accounts by 2000, from one million now, adding a new country every12-15 months.  Since Arena's elevation, "They're taking a more global view ofthe business," says Porges.  "Even though they talked global, the focus was onthe U.S.  My sense is there's a truer commitment now to non-U.S.  expansion."That will require plenty of bodies and minds, and rivals won't be sittingstill.  But analysts see only encouraging signs.  You can't say the Citi neverslips, but it's spinning its wheels a lot less these days.  Pumped up byglobal branding, its credit card business is like a battleship:  It may not benimble, but it has loads of firepower and a very long reach.Largest U.S.  Card IssuersName Receivables ($Bil) 1995 Growth 9/30/95Citibank 42.1 14.0%Discover 28.2 26.4MBNA America 23.3 32.4First USA 15.0 36.4First Chicago 14.6 20.1AT&T Universal 12.9 0.3Chase Manhattan 11.90 14.4Household Bank 11.2 4.6Chemical Bank 10.4 16.9Capital One 10.2 37.8Totals 179.8 19.4Source:  RAM ResearchOpportunity Beckons OverseasNations with most domestic credit card transactions (in millions)Country Transactions1 USA 10152 France 5773 United Kingdom 4264 Denmark 2085 Canada 1856 Japan 1707 Netherlands 14410 Portugal 9015 Argentina 2816 Colombia 24Source:  The Nilson Report, 1994Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Final Say:  CEOs Key to Sales ProcessBanking's best CEOs and business unit managers have a passion for selling anda well-defined process for managing sales.  They treat great selling as one oftheir few sustainable strategic advantages.At one of the nation's best-performing large banking groups, the presidentmakes over 300 sales calls a year and meets regularly with field salesmanagers.  At another high-performing bank, the senior retail bankingexecutive personally coaches every one of his 120 retail salespeople inselling for an hour each quarter as a model for his managers to follow.Most bank CEOs are comfortable with selling, or they wouldn't have achieved somuch career success.  But often they're uncomfortable with the time requiredto manage sales or with the functional skills of sales leadership, such assales planning and coaching.  As a result, they're often persuaded to championeasy, non-integrated solutions to sales problems, such as single-eventprograms that require little interdepartmental cooperation.  That's why mostbank sales programs aren't working.Examples of traditional bank sales practices that don't work include theindustry's popular cross-sell measures, product sales incentives and officercall programs.  These typically focus managers on activity rather than oneffectiveness.  Similarly, the structure and detail of activity-driven salestraining and mystery shopper programs make CEOs feel that a lot is being doneto increase sales and customer satisfaction, despite any hard evidence.These "quick fixes" have actually encouraged formulaic selling andproduct-pushing and have relieved managers of their sense of accountability.None of those "easy" sales interventions by themselves can provide the focus,motivation and accountability that's provided by a fully integrated salesprocess.  Most line sales managers in banking know these traditional salesprograms aren't working, but few will say so aloud because so much money andsenior management prestige is invested in them.Sales effectiveness begins at the top of the organization chart.  Research atHarvard Business School has established that having a clear sales task is themost important factor in sales motivation, coupled with feedback andaccountability.  If this is true, only the CEO and other senior executives caninfluence large gains in sales production.If a CEO doesn't communicate a clear vision of success and clear roledefinitions for selling or doesn't hold line managers accountable for salesrevenue and developing salespeople through coaching, this lack of clarityfilters down through the bank.  Employees lose their motivation, and averagesales revenue per employee falls.  Repeated surveys of bank salespeople havedemonstrated that bank employees don't know what they're supposed to dorelative to sales and customer satisfaction.  They also say they're receivingvirtually no coaching, no feedback and no meaningful consequences forperformance, good or bad.For a bank to make a quantum leap in sales, its employees must believe thatsenior managers are placing a consistent focus and priority on sales andcustomer satisfaction.A Simple AnswerWith so many banks failing at sales, what are the CEOs of successfulorganizations doing to produce outstanding results?  The answer issurprisingly simple:  Banking's best CEOs treat sales as a primary businessfunction, giving it the same commitment and attention to detail that they giveto pricing and expense control.Banking's best sales organizations show a sense of urgency and accountabilityfor sales production and customer satisfaction that isn't present at otherbanks.  This is driven by the CEO's uncompromising insistence that salesrevenue contributions and customer satisfaction be considered as key factorsin decisions affecting all functional areas of the bank.This means that improvement in sales revenue and customer satisfaction aremeasured and rewarded; that sales and customer satisfaction are key agendaitems for senior level management meetings; and that the CEO and business unitmanagers are visible in articulating clear goals, strategies and preferredways of selling, and in serving as models of personal selling and salescoaching.  None of this is rocket science, but it is increasingly clear thatactive sales leadership by the CEO pays dividends and helps improve prospectsfor long-term survival.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Funding:  Those Dwindling DepositsLike a pond drawn down by drought, the nation's depository institutions arefinding their deposit bases shrinking as consumers take their savings moneyelsewhere.  To some observers, this phenomenon has gone beyond a cyclicalevent dictated by rate movements-and has profound repercussions on the futureof bank funding."The (core) deposits are not going to come back," says Michael Brosnan,director of the Treasury and market risk division at the Office of theComptroller of the Currency (OCC).  "In my opinion, this is not a short-termphenomenon; this is a secular change in the system.  The question is, are youplanning this out, or is it just happening to you?"A recent study of this phenomenon by Charles N.  Cranmer, director of equityresearch at New York broker/dealer M.A.  Shapiro & Co.  Inc., establishesclearly that at best, core deposits at the nation's banks are stagnant, whilethe low-cost deposit categories are experiencing significant run-offs asdepositors search for higher yields.  Illiquid assets as a percent of coreliabilities, the standard for liquidity in Cranmer's study, have jumped from84% in year-end 1993 to 95% in the second quarter of 1995.And according to data from the OCC, deposits of all sorts have declined in thepast three years, and are flat to significantly lower compared with 1990 (seecharts).  Most dramatically, all time deposits in the nation's commercialbanks fell from 31.74% of total assets in mid-1990 to 22.37% in mid-1995.  Inthe same period, small time deposits fell from 20.07% to 16.43% of totalassets, while large time deposits fell from 11.67% to 5.94%.Experts say that consumer flight to higher yields isn't the only cause.  Manybanks are rationalizing their branch systems and finding that core depositsgathered through them aren't always the cheapest way to go."I think what's happened is that as banks have acquired robust informationsystems, they've come to appreciate the fully-loaded costs of acquiringcertain deposits and have become less enamored of them, because it mayactually be expensive money," says Chris Formant, a Boston-based nationalpartner in the financial services group of Coopers & Lybrand Consulting.But this phenomenon naturally sends the nation's banks into the capitalmarkets for money to lend, raising the cost of funds-and squeezing margins.And while the industry as a whole is awash in capital today, says Cranmer, itdoesn't mean the subject is so boring that bankers can safely look the otherway.  Analysts certainly aren't.  In a recent report on First Bank System,Citicorp fixed-rate analyst Blaine Frantz wrote that "available balance sheetliquidity to fund loan growth is the most noteworthy constraint on the bank'scredit profile.""If American bankers continue ignoring this (liquidity issue), one day they'llget caught with their pants down," Cranmer says.  "People don't talk muchabout liquidity, but these days, the Japanese banks have to pay 100 basispoints over the yield curve for funds, and I'm sure they wish they didn't haveto do that."Japanese banks, which don't have as well-developed an asset securitizationmarket as U.S.  banks, have reportedly endured significant outflows of foreigndeposits in recent months as news of their deep-seated problems has surfaced.These outflows have forced them into the arms of professional-andskeptical-financiers.A similar fate, say experts, awaits complacent U.S.  bankers who think theycan safely ignore balance sheet basics, and concentrate on the glamorous sideof the business, because they imagine that the bad old days of write-downs andmicroscopic bank examinations are over.  This is exactly what will cause thenext liquidity crunch if banks don't pay more attention, says Roy Smith,professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business."The real problem (today) isn't on the liquidity side-banks areover-capitalized today," he says.  "The problem is, what are banks doing withtheir capital?  And they're doing two things; buying other banks and payinghigh prices, or squandering it on some of the syndicated loans they'remaking.""They just want to look good in the locker room," he continues.  "If they'rewilling to take 11 basis points from a British conglomerate, they're surelynot covering the risks of that loan being degraded; that's a lower spread overLIBOR than they got for some of the loans that went bad in the 1980s," hesays, citing a recently syndicated loan.To a great extent, what is replacing the core deposits as an important sourceof liquidity at the nation's depository institutions is no mystery.  Mostlarger banks today are deeply into securitization and outright asset sales,and are familiar figures at the Fed funds window and in the nation's moneymarkets.As a result, most experts feel that while keeping an eye on liquidity is atthe very least well-advised, they also say that focussing on illiquid assetsas a percent of core assets as a liquidity measurement as closely as Cranmerdoes in his study is too narrow.  "When I look at liquidity, I can't look at asingle ratio," says the OCC's Brosnan.  "I look at (borrowing) capacity, aswell as asset quality issues, management issues, and the stability ofearnings.  To the extent that these things, and capital, are solid, we'rehappy."There are important cost, regulatory and accounting issues, often unremarked,that are driving the turning of U.S.  banks to securitization and asset salesas a source of liquidity.  The cost of operating a branch system to gatherdeposits, for instance, is a largely hidden, but real cost.  Also, says theOCC's Brosnan, securitization improves a bank's capital position.  "You get tofund off-balance sheet, and get a continually growing earnings stream withoutraising capital by a proportional amount."Auto loans, for instance, must be reserved against at an 8% rate, whilesecuritizing such a loan requires no reserves and releases that 8% to the bankto re-lend, explains Brosnan.  But since earnings from securitizations andasset sales flow to non-interest income on a company's annual report, it'sdifficult to measure directly the impact of that activity on the bank'sliquidity position.Cranmer doesn't disagree with this analysis.  "Securitization is a prettypowerful force on the consumer side of the market, and a clear alternative" tocore deposits, he says.  "To the extent you're creating internally generatedfunds, that's liquidity.  But while a company that's leveraged one-to-one oreven two-to-one can fund most of its needs internally, a company that'sleveraged 20-to-one never can."The growth of these sophisticated financings have allowed bankers to likewisebecome much more sophisticated in their use of the capital markets,derivatives and risk management, which is leading them away from a reliance oncore deposits as a primary source of liquidity, says Cooper & Lybrand'sFormant.  And as a result, core deposit levels don't really reflect a bank'strue liquidity.Approaching Obsolescence"I think it's becoming an obsolete measurement," he says.  "Not completelyobsolete; but the stated composition of a bank's superficial liquidity andmatching funds may not be what it really is, if you look at some of theoff-balance sheet financings, and some of the derivatives, which may changethe composition of that liquidity."The issue, then, isn't whether banks have money to lend, but how they get it."The real measure of liquidity is, what's the quality of the bank, and how arepeople looking at it?"  says the OCC's Brosnan.There's the rub; market perception.  When a bank turns from core deposits tothe money markets for much of their liquidity, everything depends on how it'sviewed on the trading floor.  And while securitization, and professionalmarkets, are perfectly reasonable venues for liquidity when properly managed,they can also turn on borrowers like tigers, in a sort of extremely grown-upversion of high school popularity.For a domestic example of how fast a good thing can go bad, look no furtherthan Continental Illinois Corp., say observers.  Once one of the nation'spremier banks, Continental Illinois was prevented under Illinois regulationsfrom having a branch system, and therefore direct access to stable coredeposits.  The result was that it had to fund itself in the money marketsevery day, to the tune of billions of dollars.Of course, other Chicago banks had to do the same, and prospered.  But in1984, a connected series of events led to its being solvent on a Friday andbroke next Monday.  Headlines and a federal reorganization inevitablyfollowed.Nightmares like that can be useful in keeping bankers from a terminal case ofcomplacency, but they're also easy to ignore, especially as the tides offinancial fashion sweep from coast to coast.  That, says Cranmer, is why nowis a good time to buttress a bank's balance sheet."There's always a credit cycle, and when times are good, you want to buildyour balance sheet in anticipation of the next down cycle," he says.  Headvises bank to stop relying so much on overnight Fed funds and to staggermaturities, so that a bank isn't caught one day carrying both a big marketbasket and a low credit rating.Sounds like common sense.  But are banks doing this?  Not really, saysCranmer.  "The whole criticism I have of the industry overall, is that they'retending to short-fund themselves.  It does cost more money to issue five-yearbank notes than to borrow overnight Fed funds, but the difference is only 50basis points.""This is something banks haven't really had to face up to, because they couldalways fund with their core deposits," Cranmer adds.  "But they want toaccommodate their long-term customers and they want to go to the closingdinners and they want to sit at the lead table.  There are all sorts ofmotivations; it just doesn't seem to me that a lot of the syndicated loansbanks are making these days are real economical."If this has a certain unhappily familiar ring to it, NYU's Professor Smith isunsurprised-and unmoved."The premium in banking, as always, goes to those who know what they're doing,and understand the problems they face, and don't squander their funds onbadly-priced loans just to gain some sort of ephemeral leadership in a marketthat may not matter to them," he says.  "What they ought to be doing isasking, 'How are we going to compete in the retail market with the mutualfunds, and how are we going to compete in the wholesale markets with theinvestment banks?'"Good questions, of course, and critical for the big picture.  But lending andspread management are the bread-and-butter of banking.  Unless the entirenotion of banking is revolutionized, banks need to be occupied with fundingissues.  Core deposits may not have the starring role they once did, but it'shard to imagine them fading into the background any time soon.Andrew Reinbach is a freelance financial writer in Shrewsbury, NJ.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Industry:  Taking It To The CourtsAmid the hoopla over the proposed merger of Chemical Banking Corp.  and ChaseManhattan Corp., there's an alarm sounded by several recent merger challengesthat threatens only to get louder.  Community activists are no longer willingto simply lick their wounds when the deals get approved and their wishes gounmet.  Now, they're suing to try to get the deals overturned.The hotbed of this activity has been New York; it's been spearheaded by InnerCity Press/Community on the Move, a Bronx-based community group whoseexecutive director, Matthew Lee, has challenged a series of bank mergers inthe past few years.  Lee and his group went to court recently to fight boththe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s approval of GreenPoint Bank'sacquisition of 60 Home Savings Bank branches and Chase's acquisition of mutualfund advisory businesses from U.S.  Trust Corp.In the former, a federal court actually issued a stay of the FDICapproval-then concluded that no relief was warranted, largely becauseGreenPoint had already made moot Inner City's chief complaint by establishinga presence in the Bronx.  Inner City sued to block the Chase-U.S.  Trustmerger on the grounds that Chase has discriminated in its mortgage lending.The court let the deal go forward, but agreed to review the administrativerecord.As the courts ruminate, the process for evaluating Chase-Chemical is goingthrough predictable paces.  The Federal Reserve Board and the New York StateBanking Department (the new Chase, as the banks call their merged entity, hasopted for a state charter) held a highly structured, two-day hearing inmid-November at which some 150 people testified.Anxious to cover all bases, the Fed extended the comment period by 11days-then tacked on another three days.  The state banking department alonereceived thousands of pages of testimony.  Much of what they heard and readwas utterly predictable, with executives from Chase and Chemical defendingtheir community service record and many activists challenging it.  A number oflegislators got into the act, with Republicans generally lauding the mergerand liberal Democrats from New York City raising objections.  In fact, aconsortium of Democrats later banded together to urge regulators to strikedown the deal.Lee, who seems to chase Chase like Ahab pursued Moby Dick-Inner City has takenthe bank on in every merger and chartering issue in the past couple ofyears-urged the regulators to deny the deal on fair lending grounds.  Chase,he argued, "is the most exclusionary banking organization in New York."What appears to be behind the legal truculence is activists' sense thatregulators remain loath to intervene in merger applications beyond a politethroat-clearing and sotto voce advice to the banks to put up a bit more cash.In a recent article in The New York Times, Ralph Nader wrote thatChase/Chemical's pledge to boost lending in underserved areas "isunenforceable, but it does provide cover for regulators eager to rubber-stampthe mergers."Nader urged a rewriting of the Bank Merger Act "by placing greater emphasis ondetermining the 'public interest' in these mergers."  He added that theJustice Department should adopt tougher standards for measuring bankcompetition than those prevalent in the Reagan-Bush era.Nader isn't likely to get his wish any time soon.  But massive mergers likeChase-Chemical throw a spotlight on job losses and other byproducts ofconsolidation that are impossible to ignore-and bring political considerationsinto the equation (see Point of View, November 1995).  Add to that the newlevel of legal scrutiny sought by Lee and his allies, and regulators may wellbe pushed to put big mergers through a finer screening.Lee's stated goal, an outright denial, is almost unthinkable.  Chemical has alegacy of "outstanding" Community Reinvestment Act ratings, and the two banksannounced a five-year, $18-billion pledge for community reinvestment (thoughmuch of it is nationwide, and targeted not at urban reinvestment but at"affordable mortgages").In an interview, Lee snorts that "it's the least well-defined of any of the(bank) mega-pledges...  If they'd made a $2-billion pledge with a specificcommitment, it would have been much better."Lee hints that if the Fed okays the merger-a decision could come as early aslate this month-his group may head back to court.  That depends in part, hesays, on how Inner City fares with its two ongoing suits.  If the only way toget CRA enforcement is through denying an application, that's the logicalroute to pursue, he adds."I expect the courts to slap him down, but one never knows," says WarrenTraiger, a New York attorney specializing in community reinvestment issues."The standard for overturning any administrative decision, of being arbitraryand capricious, is a pretty high hurdle."Traiger predicts that New York regulators will work "in tandem" with the Fedon Chase/Chemical:  "I can't imagine a divergence."  The pitch and the volumeof the criticism isn't unexpected, given that the merger will create thenation's largest bank, and the regulators can't tune it out.  Don't besurprised if the new Chase winds up making loan commitments for a few billiondollars more before the deal is sealed and delivered.-Jeffrey MarshallBack to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Mortgages:  Servicing Rights:  Still In DemandIn the third quarter of 1995, the transfer of servicing rights to loanspurchased by the nation's Congressionally chartered secondary marketingagencies fell by 7%.This barometer of activity in the lucrative field of mortgage servicing may bean indication to some that the market for home servicing rights is levelingoff.  After all, in the past banks and large mortgage bankers have beenwilling to pay up to seven times a loan's servicing fee for the right toacquire servicing in the open market.  Lately, prices have fallen back to lessstratospheric levels.Does that mean the golden days of mortgage banking are over?  Don't bet on it.Although there has been somewhat of a lull in activity in recent months,investment bankers and advisors that buy and sell servicing for their clientscite a number of different reasons for the slowdown.Some believe that buyers are waiting to see what happens with the sale ofPrudential Home Mortgage Corp., Clayton, MO, an $80-billion servicer owned byPrudential Insurance Co.  "They want to see what type of price it commands andwho winds up with it," says one Wall Streeter.  "Once that is known, some ofthe bigger players might want to rethink their strategy."Greg Bennett, managing director for Los Angeles-based Hamilton, Carter, Smith,believes there has actually been a supply shortage in servicing in recentmonths, a situation he blames on an accounting change made by the FinancialAccounting Standards Board.  The change, referred to as FAS 122 (the number ofthe rule), allows banks, mortgage bankers and other lenders to "capitalize" ontheir balance sheets the servicing rights to loans they originate.Previously, in the arcane world of accounting, only servicing rights that werepurchased on the open market could count as something of value on aninstitution's balance sheet.  (The FASB rule is prospective, not retroactive.)Bennett believes that a number of depositories that are heavily involved inservicing "have been lulled into believing that FAS 122 has changed thebusiness, when in fact it has not."  Many firms are holding onto servicingbecause they can count it as an asset without first having to sell it.  Intheory, this doesn't sound so bad-but capitalization does not immediatelytranslate into "real" cash."A mortgage servicer is still going to need cash," says Bennett, who hasbrokered many a servicing deal in his day.  "The rule change didn't change theeconomics of the business."The HCS executive anticipates that it is only a matter of time beforecompanies that have been hoarding servicing begin bringing it to market onceagain.  Once supply increases, prices likely will fall.But other factors are affecting the market as well.  As U.S.  Banker went topress in December, the bond market was continuing to rally, driving long-terminterest rates down even further.  John Wolf, a technology executive for themortgage division of Alltel Information Services, Jacksonville, FL, sees theslide in rates accelerating mortgage refinancings-which, in turn, causesservicing rights to "run off."When this occurs, as it did during the refinancing boom of 1993, buyers ofservicing rights on new loans usually claw each other in the open market,which increases prices.  That is good for servicing sellers, but bad forbuyers.Currently, prices for new servicing rights on conventional, fixed-rate loansare holding steady at about six times the servicing fee, brokers report.  (Thetypical servicing fee on a Federal National Mortgage Association-purchasedloan is 25 basis points.)  But if rates fall just a bit, another price war fornewly originated product could accelerate.In other words, the outlook for servicing rights is a bright one in 1996, andexperts anticipate that banks will continue to be big purchasers.  However, assome banks continue to gobble up mortgage banking franchises (and theservicing rights that go along with them), a few are exiting the businessentirely.  KeyCorp of Cleveland recently sold its servicing division, as didBarclays American.Bank of Boston Corp.  is spinning off BancBoston Mortgage Corp., Jacksonville,FL, a $40-billion servicer, while First Bank System of Minneapolis is on theverge of selling its mortgage division, FBS Mortgage Corp., St.  Paul.Many of the current sales are being facilitated through a competitive bidprocess, in which an offering circular on the target company is circulated toprospective buyers.  However, some investment bankers feel that this year themarket could see an increase in privately negotiated transactions.  "I thinkprivate, or 'direct' deals, represent a growing segment of the business," saysTed Jadlos, a broker with United Financial Inc., Denver.Based in Washington, D.C., Paul Muolo is a senior editor of National MortgageNews, a Faulkner & Gray publication.Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. BANKER via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996PeopleEmbracing A Dynamic MarketJOHN A.  NIGHTitle:  President and CEO, MidAmerica Bank, St.  Paul, MNNew situation:  Comes to the Twin Cities from Wyoming, where he had beenpresident and CEO of Rocky Mountain Bank in Cheyenne before it was acquired in1994 by Metropolitan Financial Corp.Dynamic environment:  Nigh, an Indiana native, says he has had exposure overthe years to Minnesota and always admired the market.  "It's one ofstrongest-growing economic areas in the country," he says.Strategic thrust:  Plans to add new business services to MidAmerica, which has27 branches and $650 million in assets in Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Says thatentails offering "a big basket of services," including cash management, to avaried group of industries.  The margins in that business are attractive, and"when you have such a diverse basket, you have a pretty diverse risksituation."Philosophy:  "We don't re-create the wheel.  We take a group of services, andbundle and interlock them.  This gives the borrowers a lot better perspective,sometimes, than they get elsewhere."  Believes that "the CEO is the number onemarketing person in the bank.  This is a sales business.  The whole game isthe manner of delivery."Competition:  Acknowledges the prowess of superregional competitors likeNorwest Corp.  and First Bank System.  "We're not going to take that groupon," he says.  Believes there is a very viable place for a small bank that is"both very high-touch and very high-tech."Background:  Started in banking 23 years ago in Omaha, and ran two smallinstitutions in the 1970s.  Went to Wyoming in 1983, where he worked for KeyBancshares (predecessor of KeyCorp) and rose to executive vice president.Moved to Rocky Mountain Bank after it was formed in 1988 from the combinationof two failed thrifts.Still in the Snow Belt:  Acknowledges that he can't expect warmer winters inMinnesota, but says, "I think the wind is worse in Wyoming."Plotting A Global CourseJOSEPH BARTOLONITitle:  Managing Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's Wood GundySecurities Inc.'s Global Technology UnitResponsibilities:  Supervises systems development and product support for theinvestment bank of the Toronto-based commercial banking company.The vision thing:  Working closely with his boss, Tom Kielty, Wood Gundy'ssenior vice president for technology, on a new information technology strategyto support the firm's global capital markets and other securities operations.Small is beautiful:  "The whole client/server environment is the core of ourdirection," he says.  During the past 15 years, Bartoloni has observed smallerplatforms like workstations and personal computer local-area networks assumethe dominant role in investment banking.  "I don't even know if we have anymainframes in our current environment."  In the past, workstations and PCswere often just stopgap solutions for setting up new offices in London orTokyo.  Now, the small systems perform almost all of the firm's computingtasks.Need for speed:  In a world where dollars fly past yen at the speed of light,and the European countries are in the midst of creating a common currency fromscratch, someone in Bartoloni's job has to work fast.  "The markets are thedominating factor," and there's never a lot of time to work on new projects.Background:  Ran a management consulting business for commercial andinvestment banks for the past two years.  Spent the previous 13 years ininvestment banking, including successive six-year stints at Merrill Lynch from1980-86 and First Boston from 1986-92.  Also spent two years at LehmanBrothers.Education:  B.S.  and MBA from New York University, where he also studiedcomputer science.Spare time:  Spends his free time with his wife, son and daughter, and he alsocoaches the kids' soccer and basketball teams.People is edited by Jeffrey Marshall.Back to Headline List WT03-B39-27IA060-000326-B016-174http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi90.html 205.156.212.5 19970115013721 text/html 73119HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:35:15 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:30 GMTContent-length: 72930Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi90.html Sample Issue Copyright WORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNet February 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES A PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR?

Firstly, there isthe Binders/ADT legal case. The action related to an agreed bid byBritannia Security Group, audited by Binders. After the acquisition ADTfound the profits and net assets over stated. The judge found that notonly had Binders been negligent but they owed a duty of care to ADTbecause the lead partner told ADT in an 'off the cuff' remark that hestood by the firm's audit opinion. Out goes Caparo where it was decidedan auditor did not have a duty of care to third parties - unless theAppeal Court says something different.There is only bad news and worse newsOn to the damages: the bad news was that the judge awarded damagestotalling #105m ($160m): the worse news is that the firm only hasinsurance cover of #71m leaving partners to pick up the tag for therest - an uncomfortable #300,000 each for the 100 or so partnersinvolved. Binders partners are left to sweat for a year or so and therest of the profession can declare that something must be done to solvethe problem they have, in part, created. The obvious solution would bereform the law, but that looks unlikely to happen quickly, with agovernment gearing up for an election, despite an official review ofthe problem which is due to be published soon.So the Big 6 firms lost patience and decided to take matters into theirown hands.Incorporation seems the best way forwardBefore the ADT decision, KPMG partners had already announced that theywere going to incorporate as the best solution they could find to theliability crisis. And alongside incorporation they have promised fullfinancial disclosure. Whether the revelation over size of partners'drawing helps or hinders the firms' cause remains to be seen.At the same time as the ADT bombshell, Ernst & Young and PriceWaterhouse announced they intend to avoid possible financial disasterby forming limited liability partnerships in the offshore haven ofJersey. All they need is the legislation due this summer from theJersey Parliament which would be similar to Delaware law in the US and,in theory at least, would protect partners' private assets.Whether any of these moves will, in the long run, help firmsprofessionally, commercially or on the PR front, remains to be seen.There are many examples of trends starting in the US and quicklyreaching the UK and elsewhere. In the case of tort reform, for UKpartners at least, this particular trend cannot cross the pond toosoon.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996ACCOUNTANTS GET LITIGATION RELIEF FOR CHRISTMASJust days before Christmas, the US accounting profession's long heldwish for securities litigation reform was finally granted. It was thebest Christmas present imaginable for a profession that has beenbattered by enormous legal expenses.For the past four years, the American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants (AICPA) and the major accounting firms had intenselylobbied Congress for litigation reform. 'We are extremely pleased withthe legislation enacted,' Margaret Simmons, legislative affairscoordinator for AICPA, told WAR.In recent years, the Big 6 firms have collectively spent as much as 12%of their annual fee income defending or settling litigation. The newlegislation should significantly lighten that burden.Two key provisions of the new legislation, formally known as thePrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, are expected to curbthe number of lawsuits brought against accountants. The first has to dowith what is known as the pleading stage of a case. The new lawrequires that plaintiffs in a securities lawsuit make specificallegations of management fraud at the time the suit is filed, saidSimmons.This was not a requirement in the past. Plaintiff attorneys had beenaccused of turning the discovery stage into fishing expeditionsdesigned to rack up huge legal bills. The mounting legal costsencouraged many defendants to cut their losses by settling out ofcourt, even though they might have been innocent of any wrongdoing.Legal scholars say that the new pleading standard raises the thresholdfor a case to proceed to discovery, which should significantly reduceaccounting firms' legal expenses.A second important provision of the reform bill does away with thejoint and several liability system that had been in place. Under thenew law, defendants can only be held responsible for the proportion ofthe losses they are deemed to have caused. In the past, if a companywent insolvent and its auditors were deemed to have contributed to evena small percentage of investor losses, the accounting firm could beheld fully liable for all investor losses.Under the new law, joint and several liability remains in place only ininstances where the accounting firm is shown to have participated inthe fraud.AICPA president Barry Melancon said the law now strikes a fair balancebetween the rights of truly defrauded investors and outsideprofessionals 'who had become victims of a small group ofentrepreneurial lawyers abusing the legal system.'Other important protections afforded by the new law include:- A 'safe harbour' provision protects companies, and their advisers,from claims of fraud in the event that their prediction of futureperformance do not pan out.- A provision requires courts to sanction plaintiffs and plaintiffattorneys who initiate frivolous lawsuits.- The statute of limitations for filing securities lawsuits remainsunchanged. Plaintiffs must file claims within three years of the timethe violation occurred or within one year of the time the violation isdiscovered.- A provision allows judges to select as lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit the party with the greatest financial stake. Someplaintiffs had been accused of taking small stakes in numerouscompanies, thereby positioning themselves to become lead plaintiffs tothe largest number of potential class actions.The accounting community's original reform wish-list included severalother provisions which became casualties of the legislative process anddid not become law. These included a fee shifting proposal that wouldhave required unsuccessful plaintiffs to pay all legal fees incurred bythe defendants.All in all, the new law provides accountants all the protections theycould have reasonably hoped for, Simmons said.As a tradeoff for the protections afforded by the act, accountants willbe subjected to additional oversight on the part of the Securities andExchange Commission (SEC). The new law gives the SEC the power toprosecute accountants, lawyers and underwriters who wittingly helpcorporate executives commit fraud.The SEC had previously had that power stripped from it in a 1994Supreme Court case. The court held that corporate advisers could not beheld liable for the actions of their clients.Another significant concession made by the accounting profession is aprovision of the law which make accountants responsible to reportfraud. An auditor who uncovers fraud during an audit must report theillegality to the company's audit committee, its board of directors or,in some circumstances, the SEC.The new legislation is notable not only for the protections it affordsaccountants, but also for the dramatic manner in which it became law.In early December, both houses of Congress voted on and passed thefinal version of the litigation reform bill by wide margins. It waspresented to President Clinton, who had earlier expressed his support,to be signed into law.At the eleventh hour, the president unexpectedly vetoed thelegislation. The veto reportedly came after the president held aprivate meeting with William Lerach, a prominent member of theplaintiff bar and one of the largest contributors to the Democraticparty which funded Clinton's presidential bid.In response, the AICPA fired off a terse press release decrying theveto. It read in part: 'The President has once again neglected the willof the people and caved in to a small group of wealthy, powerfulcontributors.'Despite the veto, the coalition supporting the bill held together. On20 December and 22 December respectively, the House of Representativesand the Senate voted to override the presidential veto (a two-thirdssuper majority was required in each chamber) and passed the bill intolaw.The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 was the first vetooverride suffered by the Clinton administration.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996REPORT PUBLISHED ON PROVISIONSFASB has published a report, Provisions: Their recognition, measurementand disclosure in financial statements, in conjunction with standard-setters in the UK, Canada and Australia as well as the InternationalAccounting Standards Committee. The report is aimed at developingsolutions to accounting problems based on common accounting frameworks.FASB chairman Dennis Beresford noted that: 'Accounting for provisionsis an important topic for standard-setters around the world becausethey are often material in reporting financial performance. Very littleaccounting guidance currently exists for provisions, which may lead toa diversity in practice.'The report explores the basic issues of when provisions should berecognised, how they should be measured, and what disclosures should bemade. Additionally, the report considers specific applications tofuture operating losses and restructuring costs, areas in whichprovisions are often recognised.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996WORKSHOP DEFINES OBJECTIVESAn UNCTAD workshop on environmental accounting recently establishedpriorities for its current work programme. Participants decided toprepare a synthesis of existing financial accounting requirements, lookat links between financial reporting and general environmentalmonitoring information, and work on systems which produce environmentalcost accounting information for companies.Following on from the 1995 conference of the Intergovernmental WorkingGroup of Experts in International Standards of Accounting and Reporting(ISAR) which presented a series of studies on environmental accounting(see WAR, April 1995, p2), participants from several countries met inGeneva recently to discuss what further contribution UNCTAD could makein this area. The ISAR conference had suggested that some form ofguidelines could be produced.The working party defined environmental accounting as taking infinancial accounting (eg provisions for decommissioning costs), 'fullcost' management accounting, general environmental reporting, andenvironmental audit. It decided that work could be done to present andintegrate existing financial accounting rules which bear onenvironmental issues as a first step. Similarly, a study could be madeof environmental reporting indicators in use to see which were the mostmeaningful, and examine whether any useful link could be built betweenfinancial reporting and the present free-ranging, voluntaryenvironmental reporting which is being done by some companies.Some companies are experimenting with cost accounting which provides apicture of environmental costs. Participants observed that much of thiswork was not published because of its confidential nature, but thisprevented rapid development. UNCTAD had a role there, but it was feltthat it should not involve itself further in environmental auditing.It was also decided that UNCTAD should look at the possibility ofproviding an electronic bulletin board for environmental accountingliterature, as well as developing education and training programmes indue course.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996TRADE IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICESThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) working party on professionalservices, which is working on cross-border provision of accountingservices, had its third meeting in January. The meeting set out a listof subjects to be addressed in a model agreement, and asked for furtherinformation on professional qualifications in developing countries.The WTO's council for trade in services was established as part of thelast GATT agreement to prepare the way for a liberalisation of cross-border trade in services, with accounting as a priority. It hasestablished a working party which met for the first time last October(see WAR November 1995, p3) whose objective is to prepare a modelagreement for cross-border trade in accounting services.At its January meeting in Geneva, the working party, to which all WTOmembers are entitled to send representatives, agreed on a list ofissues which would need to be addressed in any model agreement. Thislist includes questions such as:- mutual recognition of professional qualifications- minimum periods of post-qualification experience- minimum educational requirements- professional liability arrangements- relationships with local professional bodies- use of IASC standards.Members of the working party agreed to review these issues from anational perspective and meet again in March to discuss them.Although the working party had already been given extensive briefingsby IFAC and UNCTAD in October, some members felt that they need furtherinformation about conditions in developing countries before they couldproceed. The collection of such data would take some time, and wouldhave the effect of considerably slowing progress, which could, ofcourse, be one reason for suggesting it.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996WHO HOLDS THE GOVERNANCE REINS?A taskforce of the International Capital Markets Group (ICMG) hasreleased a report entitled Who holds the reins?, focusing on theinternational dimension of corporate governance, from a review ofcorporate governance practices and issues in countries such as the US,UK and Canada.The taskforce encourages all major companies to disclose the key areasof their corporate governance processes so that they have appropriatechecks in place to direct and manage businesses, and so that investorsunderstand that differences exist between countries. The taskforcehowever ruled out the idea of prescribing an international standard forcorporate governance because, as ICMG members stated: 'Governance isabout behaviour. It is deeply rooted in national cultures which varywidely, reflecting the economic, social and legal traditions of eachcountry.'ICMG is encouraging debate on its recommendations among its constituentmembers - the Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs, theInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and the Section onBusiness Law of the International Bar Association.Copies of Who holds the reins? are available from IFAC, 114 West 47thStreet, Suite 2410, New York, NY 10036.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996IASC LOOKS AGAIN AT SEGMENTAL REPORTINGThe International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), has publishedan Exposure Draft, E51 on segmental reporting which proposes majorchanges to its existing standard, published 15 years ago.E51 proposes to change the way in which segments are identified and addseveral new segment disclosure requirements. It would also make anenterprise's internal organisation and management structure and itssystem of internal financial reporting to the chief executive officerthe basis for identifying the dominant source and nature of risks andtherefore the business or geographical segments reported.A safety net provision will ensure that if there is evidence thatinternally reported segments combine parts of the business withdifferent risks and returns, they must be disaggregated for externalreporting purposes.The E51 proposals are the result of cooperation between IASC and NorthAmerican standard-setters, as well as extensive consultations withfinancial analysts and multinational corporations.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996IFAC RELEASE GUIDANCE ON ITThe Education Committee of IFAC has issued a new InternationalEducation Guideline, Information technology in the accountingcurriculum.The Guideline recognises that developments in the area of IT havesignificant implications for the accountancy profession and for the preand post-qualification education of IFAC members.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996EUROPE: FEE STATES GROWTH IN ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITINGFEE has published a survey called Environmental accounting, reportingand auditing: Survey of current activities and developments within theaccountancy profession covering all 15 European Union countries, aswell as Iceland, Israel, Norway and Switzerland.It concludes that there is clear and definite growth in the importanceattached to environmental accounting, reporting and auditing inbusiness across the EU, but environmental information is still largelyrestricted to qualitative information with no assessment of thefinancial impact.The survey is based on the responses to a questionnaire circulatedamong FEE's 34 member organisations in 22 countries.FEE said that: 'The development of an accounting and managementreporting framework which specifically addresses environmental issuesis perhaps some way off.

The EC is urgingcompanies to use them in response to a growing insistence byshareholders and investors that companies shoulder their environmentalprotection responsibilities, although it said that the report does notreflect its official position.The objective of the guidelines, entitled Environmental issues infinancial reporting is to ensure that company accounts paint anaccurate picture of:- a company's attitude towards the environment, and- the impact of environmental risks and liabilities on a company'sfinancial position.The document provides recommendations on the definition and disclosureof environmental expenditure and the recognition, measurement anddisclosure of environmental risks and liabilities.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: SOCIETY CALLS FOR E50'S WITHDRAWALThe Australian Society CPAs is calling for the immediate withdrawal ofE50, the ISAC's proposed International Accounting Standard onintangibles.

In most cases, these companies will be forcedto amortise the asset within 20 years - a period which is often muchless than the useful life of the asset - and a period which will forcecompanies with extremely valuable intangibles to suffer a paper loss inreal company value. 'Such a harsh approach is unwarranted and out oftouch with modern economic reality.'Kropp said that some assets have an indeterminate useful life and wouldbe best measured by subjecting them to a recoverable test rather thanthe amortisation regime advocated in E50. The Society also criticisedthe restrictive approach taken to initial recognition of an intangibleasset being based solely on cost. The use of an 'other value' approach,provided it can be reliably measured, is appropriate, particularly inrelation to intangibles, the submission states.The ASCPA wants E50 to be withdrawn and reconsidered by the IASSteering Committee.'In its current form, the Society would not recommend to the AustralianAccounting Standards Boards and the Public Sector Accounting StandardsBoard to pursue Australian harmonisation with this draft standard,'Kropps said. 'This is a good example of why Australian standard-settersshould maintain strong influence over the direction of internationalstandards.'Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996GOODWILL ED ISSUED'The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), and the PublicSector Accounting Standards Board (PSASB), have approved the issue ofan Exposure Draft which proposes changing the accounting standard ongoodwill to require entities to amortise goodwill on a straight-linebasis.They say the effect of the amendments would 'make the Australianstandard and existing practice more comparable with standards andpractices in most other countries.'The main effect of the proposal will be to preclude the use, by a smallnumber of entities, of the 'Inverse Sum Of the Years Digits' (ISOYD)and similar methods.The ISOYD method results in small amortisation charges in early yearsand the defers the bulk of amortisation charges to later years. InSeptember 1995, the Urgent Issues Group placed a moratorium on the useof ISOYD method until 1 July 1996, and requested the Boards to clarifythe standard.The Exposure Draft proposes that the standard will apply to reportingperiods ending on or after 30 June 1996. AASB chairman, Ken Spencer,notes that the scope of the current review of the standard is limitedto dealing with the issue referred to Boards by the UIG. Considerationof this issue could not be delayed and considered as part of a morecomprehensive review of the standards. International developments, suchas the new approach to accounting for goodwill being debated in the UK,are not likely to become clear before the UIG moratorium ends. TheExposure Draft is open for public comment until 15 February 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996ED RELEASED ON NON-CURRENT ASSETSAASB and PSASB have released Exposure Draft on accounting for non-current assets. ED 70, proposes amendments to the depreciation andrevaluation standards to remove impediments for entities adoptingcurrent values for non-current assets. The proposed amendments to therevaluation standard would permit entities to revalue non-currentassets on a progressive basis, as long as all assets within therelevant class are revalued consistently within a three year period.The standard, which currently require revaluations of all assets withina class to be completed as at the same date, is considered to impose anonerous requirement on public sector entities which have adopted apolicy of revaluing non-current assets frequently and on an on-goingbasis.ED 70 permits entities, adopting a current cost or deprival valuebases, an option in the disclosure of asset value. ED 70 also proposesthat the definition of 'useful life' in the depreciation standards bechanged to reflect the period over which an entity expects to use anassets rather than the period over which the asset could remain usefulin some other environment.The Boards say this amendment will ensure that depreciation expensesare more closely related to the pattern of economic benefits consumedby the entity and that the amended standards will be more comparablewith pronouncements overseas.The comment period for ED 70 is short. It closes on 29 February 1996.The short period reflects the need for public sector entities to adoptthese amendments in preparing their financial reports for 30 June 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996EQUITY METHODS PROPOSEDAASB and PSAB have also approved the issue of ED 71, Accounting forinvestments in associates by the equity method. The ED proposes thatentities equity account investments in associates in their financialstatements. The Boards note there is a perceived impediment in theCorporations Law to applying equity accounting on the face of thefinancial statements, and companies are disclosing information abouttheir associates in the notes to the financial statements.The Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 proposes to removethe perceived legal impediment to equity accounting.Now the Boards have responded by developing an Exposure Draft which, ifadopted, would bring Australian practices in this area into line withpractice overseas.The ED proposes that equity accounting be applied in the consolidatedfinancial statements for all investments in associates and, except inlimited circumstances, the cost method of accounting is to be appliedin the investor's separate financial statements.Other features of the draft proposals:- the equity method of accounting is to be applied in respect of allassociates. Associates are defined broadly to include associatedcompanies, partnerships, trusts and other forms of arrangement in whichthe investor has an ownership interest and has the capacity to exercisesignificant influence;- the carrying amount of an equity accounted investment must not exceedits net market value;The ED proposes that the subsequent standard will apply for reportingperiods ending on or after 30 June 1997. Closing date for publiccomment on the proposals is 31 March 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO BE DERECOGNISEDThe Urgent Issues Group (UIG) is continuing to examine the issue ofwhether internally generated identifiable intangible assets can be'derecognised'.The group notes that the accounting standards AASB 1010 and AAS 10,Accounting for the revaluation of non-current assets identify thecircumstances in which assets can be revalued downwards, and Statementof Accounting Concepts ASC 4, Definition and recognition of theelements of financial statements, identifies the circumstances in whichassets could be derecognised.At its most recent meeting the UIG concluded that the issue underconsideration was much broader than that the derecognition of onlyinternally generated intangible assets. The group agreed that it shouldclarify that a 'revaluation' included a change in accounting policiesrelated to the bases of measurement adopted for any class of assets.A once only change in the basis should be allowed, and that a changeback to a cost basis should be permitted only within the transitionalperiod.After this transitional period expires AASB 1010 and AAS 10 will onlyallow a downwards revaluation arising from a change in the basis ofmeasurement when the carrying amount of an asset is greater than itsrecoverable amount.In these circumstances AASB 1010 and AAS 10 will require that the assetnot be revalued below its recoverable amount.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996LACK OF CONSENSUS ON DEPRECIATION POLICYThe UIG has been unable to reach a consensus on the treatment ofchanges in the rate of depreciation which arise from revised estimatesof useful life or residual value.The alternatives canvassed by the UIG include depreciating the asset atthe new rate over its remaining life, or adjusting the carrying amountof the asset by making a catch-up adjustment in the profit and loss orother operating statement.The relevant accounting standards AASB 1021 and AAS 4, Depreciation ofnon-current assets do not specify how to deal with revisions ofestimates and the requirements of international standards vary as doespractice in Australia.Discussion at the UIG indicated that most Australian companies adopteda prospective approach and this was the practice in many overseascountries.To reach a consensus, 11 of the 16 UIG members must vote for, and nomore than two vote against, the proposed ruling.A majority of members favoured the prospective approach but there weremore than two members who did not think it correct. The group does notplan to discuss the issue any further.- Peter Day has been appointed chairman of the UIG in place of PeterEdwards who died last year.

It deals withaccounting for banks and non-banking financial institutions.The new standard focuses mainly on financial statements, but it alsodeals with branches of foreign banks and non-banking organisations,performing banking transactions in Bulgaria with a permit (licence)issued by the Bulgarian National Bank.In this standard the Bulgarian National Bank is defined as theauthorised organisation to determine rules of accounting for bankoperations. The most significant difference between the old standardand the new one is that the detailed regulation of the principles ofaccounting for bank operations - which were described at length in theold standard - is absent in the latter. The other difference is thatthe primary accounting documents and ledgers, such as journal of theoperations, trial balance, general ledger, operation ledger etc, weredescribed in detail in the old standard. The structure of the NationalBank Chart of Accounts, in effect since 1 June 1995, was elaborated inthe old Chart of Accounts, while the new standard only briefly mentionsthe existence of such a Chart of Accounts.Opinions differ. Some experts think that the new Chart of Accounts ismuch more concise and clearer. Others - mainly bank experts - say thatit is much more incomplete and insufficient.NAS 16 has the following structure:- General provisions - describing the regulations and institutions theyare applicable for.- Definitions - giving definitions to the term financial institution,bank transaction, bank operation, individual item, accounting date,values.- Characteristics of the accounting policy.- Specific rules of accounting for bank operations.- Periodic financial statements.

This year the committees looked at 90 companies onthe main market and 37 on the second market as well as 39 investmentfunds.The review committees noted that the evaluation of internal controlshad improved and overall the number of problems noted had fallen,suggesting an improvement in audit quality. However, they said that themost common problems concerned the calculation of goodwill inconsolidated accounts and other intangibles and their depreciation.They also thought that the choices made by companies in excluding orincluding companies within the consolidation were not well-documentedor explained. They criticised the methods used by some companies incalculating provisions.CNCC has a programme of peer review for all audit engagements, althoughCOB participates only in the examination of the files of listedcompanies. In the year under review, in addition to the work on listedcompanies, CNCC looked at 4,400 audit files throughout France,involving the work of 2,200 auditors.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996FRANCE: FREE SERVICES FOR NEW COMPANIESThe Ordre des Experts Comptables has undertaken a series of initiativesdesigned to encourage newly-formed businesses to use the services ofaccounting firms. These will involve free start-up advice and budgetpreparation, as well as reduced fees for work during the first threeyears of a company's life.An agreement signed by Rene Richol, president Ordre, and the Ministerof Finance in 1994 provided for free services for individualentrepreneurs in the first year of their activity, including budgetsand ultimately preparations of the first tax return.

In December 1995 theInstitute published a new version of the audit reports as part of itsplan to adopt many of the IFAC and IASC standards as soon as possible.The extended report refers specifically to the extent of the auditors'work. The standard which was to apply to all accounts ending or after31 December 1995 was firmly rejected by the Commission which claimedthat the new report is an attempt to reduce the auditors'responsibilities and liabilities.The Institute has stated that its only intention remains to explainclearly the extent of the work of the auditor and reduce theexpectation gap of shareholders and the public. The Institute hasalways contended that it has the sole right to set standards andtherefore the Auditors' Council (an office of the Ministry of Justice)stepping in to settle the dispute has taken the profession by surprise.The Ministry of Justice is now preparing a legal opinion as to theauthority of the Institute to set standards. Meanwhile the Institutehas agreed that the new standard will only be used on auditors' reportssigned after mid February. Members of the Institute's central committeeand members in general fear that it is yet another example of theSecurities Commission trying to 'muscle in' on the standards makingprocess. After years of disputes concerning accounting standards, inthe end a joint committee with the Institute, Securities Commission,Industrialists and the tax authorities was formed.

The proposal is that they must examine andcomment on not only financial matters but also all aspects ofmanagement and administration and the affect on the company,shareholders, other interested parties, and the general public.Meanwhile the director is personally indemnified against his actions.In addition it is proposed that auditors fees will be set in generalmeeting of the members only.

In September a major merger operation - SuperGemina-Ferfin - was announced followed soon after by revelations of heavylosses within the Gemina group.In a newsletter published last month (January), Commissione Nazionaleper le Societa e la Borsa (Consob - the companies and stock marketregulator which also supervises the roll of approved audit firms),announced that it has instructed Coopers not to use the services of itspartner Renato Bellani for a period of two years. Moreover, theaccountants have had their three-year 1995-1997 appointment as Gemina'sauditors revoked.In announcing its decision, Consob said: 'The penalty has been adoptedon the basis of the checks carried out on the audit work for the 1992and 1993 financial statements of Gemina Ratealfactor, of the Geminagroup consolidated accounts for 1993 and consolidated accounts of RCSEditori at 31 December 1992 and 31 December 1993.'Following Consob's decision, Coopers said that it seems that Consob haschosen the Gemina affair to set a pilot decision. 'For the first time,in fact, a form of objective responsibility has been adopted withregard to the principal auditors of a group, putting the blame ontothem for the work done by others.'Making their complaint against the regulator, Coopers said that thelosses which were the subject of Consob's investigations in the Geminacase, arose in the hire purchase sales sector of RCS Libri & GrandiOpere and that these losses were not brought into evidence quicklybecause of serious shortcomings in the internal controls of thecompany. But RCS Libri & Grandi Opere was audited by another firm,while Coopers audited its parent, RCS Editori, and the group parentGemina. Coopers, in accordance with current practice, relied on thework done by the other, well-qualified, audit firm, which had auditedRCS Libri & Grandi Opere for many years.Coopers claim that their work was wholly correct and say that thelosses investigated by Consob, in so far as they were reflected inGemina's consolidated accounts, arose from sources that were not withinCoopers' competence. 'Consob's decision is therefore unjust and Cooperswill appeal to the regional administrative tribunal to have itannulled,' said the firm.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996ITALY: PROFESSION DISPUTE RAGES ONThe long-running dispute between Italy's dottori commercialisti(commercial practitioner accountants) and ragionieri (bookkeeperaccountants) on professional titles is continuing.

She compared the problems posed bydifferent regulatory requirements in each country, with those faced byEU members when tackling harmonisation on other issues.Mackenzie said that in developing financial reporting standardsparticular notice is paid to the position of the InternationalAccounting Standards Committee (IASC).

Under new banking laws, crossed cheques now cannot beendorsed for payment to another person and can only be paid into theaccount of the named payee. This means accountants who receive paymentson behalf of clients have to make special arrangements to ensure theycan continue to bank the payments in their trust accounts. Preferablythey must ensure the cheque is made out to the accountancy firm insteadof in the client's name. Alternatively they must arrange for opencheques.A request to the New Zealand parliament seeking exemption for trustaccount operators to continue depositing cheques made out to clients,into their trust accounts was refused. The law-makers decided that togive accountants and lawyers this exemption from the new law, wouldweaken the protection now provided by the new non-transferableregulations.While admitting accountants will suffer some inconvenience, parliamentdecided it was more important for the writer of a cheque to ensure itwas paid only to the payee.In the past there was a widely held belief that crossing a chequeprevented it from being endorsed and transferred to a person other thanthe payee named. In fact under banking law which existed up to 1January 1996, it did not.The new law, aimed at preventing fraud says that now a crossed chequebearing the words 'Not transferable', 'Non transferable' or 'Accountpayee' can only be paid to the named payee. Thieves will no longer beable to cash stolen cheques by forging an endorsement to themselves orto a third party.Another provision of the new banking law is that banks no longer haveto physically transfer paper cheques to the branches on which they aredrawn. Now the details can be done electronically - cutting costs andspeeding up cheque clearance.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996NEW ZEALAND: SHARING THE COST OF STANDARDSThe president of the New Zealand Accountants Society, Colin Notley,agrees with those who argue that the cost of researching and developingstandards should be shared by the business community and others whobenefit from their application.This argument, said Notley, has been given added strength because NewZealand's Financial Reporting Standards, when approved by theAccounting Standards Review Board, now carry legal backing.'In one sense the Society's Financial Reporting Standards Board - whichdoes the preliminary work reviewing standards - has become a researchand working arm of government,' added Notley.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996UNITED KINGDOM: 'EFFECTIVENESS' SHOULD GO SAYS APBInterpretation of the word 'effectiveness' when asking directors toreport on internal financial control effectiveness is a sticking point,according to the Auditing Practices Board (APB). The APB has releasedthe text of a letter it has sent to Sir Ronald Hampel, chairman of thenewly formed 'Committee on Corporate Governance', setting out itsprincipal conclusions following consultation concerning reporting byauditors on the matter.To build on progress made to date, the APB considers that the HampelCommittee should:- Consider further how best to report on internal financial control. Inparticular there is the need either to define much more closely themeaning of the term 'effectiveness' or consider whether there are otheroptions that would meet the spirit of the original Cadbury proposal butavoid the need to interpret the term effectiveness. Announcing the APBconclusions, APB chairman Ian Plaistowe said: 'We believe that auditorswill find it difficult to report on internal financial controleffectiveness unless words are changed. The APB would support wordsalong the lines of statements used by the BOC Group plc and The Coca-Cola Company.' The report of the BOC Group directors states: 'Thedirectors believe that the Group's system of internal financial controlprovides reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets aresafeguarded, transactions are authorised and recorded properly and thatmaterial errors and irregularities are either prevented or would bedetected within a timely period.'- Study further the role of internal auditors in reporting on internalcontrol. The Cadbury Report did not deal, other than in passingreference, with the role of internal audit. Internal auditors have anintegral part to play in any regime in which directors and auditorsreport on internal controls. In particular, they are likely to considerthe wider concept of non-financial internal controls, whereas the workof external auditors is focused more on internal financial controls.The APB letter is a culmination of feedback and consultation whichbegan in December 1994 when the APB published Guidance for directors.Implementation of the guidance has resulted in many listed companiescarrying out detailed reviews of their internal financial controls andcommentators believe that, as a result, controls are improving. The APBheld a public debate in June 1995, and in written responses to itsApril 1995 discussion paper Internal financial control effectiveness,commentators expressed strong reservations about the practicality ofauditors reporting on directors' opinions on the effectiveness ofinternal financial controls. Philip Ashton, chairman of the APBInternal Control Working Party said: 'Now the Hampel Committee is inbusiness, it is timely to look at the issues causing difficulty. Also 1January 1996 was the date on which it became compulsory for directorsto report on internal controls.'The APB also supports the majority of companies which responded toInternal financial control effectiveness in calling for a two-yearmoratorium on further reforms. 'This will give everyone an opportunityto see the best way forward, particularly the Hampel Committee one itgets fully underway,' said Plaistowe.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD ACCOUNTING REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996UNITED KINGDOM: ACCA SEEKS CHARTERED DESCRIPTIONThe Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) is one stepaway from changing its name to the Association of Chartered CertifiedAccountants, and calling its members chartered certified accountants.The move follows a Privy Council decision, that in principle, it has noobjection to the inclusion of the term chartered in the descriptions ofmembers of any of the accountancy bodies which has a Royal Charter.ACCA's Council will now seek the approval of members at the May 1996AGM with a view to making a prompt application to the Privy Council.Michael Harvey, ACCA's president said: 'The option chartered certifiedaccountant would enable the Association to retain the ACCA/FCCAdesignation and build on the well-established certified brand.'ACCA confirmed that from 1 January 1996, it is no longer a member ofthe accountancy profession's Joint Disciplinary scheme (JDS).

As a corporation, Amex did not fitthat bill.Amex's lawsuit against the state board claimed that the Florida statutewas a violation of its employees' constitutional right to free speech.A Florida federal district court agreed with that charge and issued apermanent injunction against the state enforcing its statute.

Implementing FAS 115, Accounting for certaininvestments in debt and equity securities, required banks to classifytheir investments as trading securities, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Difference accounting rules applied to each class ofinvestments.Some of the banks most volatile investments were classified as held-to-maturity to insulate bank earnings from price fluctuations. Because ofthe banks' stated intent to hold these investments, they were notrequired to be written down to market values as bond prices plunged in1994.The interest rate scenario improved appreciable in 1995, however, asdid the value of the bankers' investments.

and that it may rely for survival on the support ofthe nine Ulster Unionist MPs.Ministers played down claims by one left-of-centre Tory that at leastsix other MPs were prepared to defect to opposition parties. Yetseveral admitted that by-elections triggered by the deaths of MPs wouldput the Tories into a Commons minority this year. The departure of MissNicholson means the government can now expect two pending by-electionsto cut its Commons majority to just one, if Sir Richard Body, whoremains outside the Tory whip, is excluded from calculations.However, despite increasing signs that his party may have to rely ontheir support in any No Confidence motion, Sir Patrick Mayhew, NorthernIreland secretary, insisted there would be 'no special treatment' forthe UUP.'I recognise no difference in the essential equation by reason ofevents in the last few days or even a longer period,' he told BBC Radio4's Today programme.Other ministers, however, were already contemplating the need forconcessions to the UUP, with one privately conceding that relationswith the Ulster parties would be 'critical' to the government'sfortunes.Calculations about the government's majority coincided with signs thatthe delicate truce between left and rightwing Tories appeared to betottering in the wake of the defection.Mr Michael Portillo, defence secretary, launched a strong attack onMiss Nicholson, rubbishing her claims that the reason for her defectionhad been the party's shift to the right.'It is very silly to say that the party has tilted to the right - thatis completely incredible,' he told BBC radio. 'I think the party isprobably much the same. We have a broad breadth of opinion within theparty.'Mr John Redwood, last year's beaten Tory leadership challenger, alsoattacked the idea of a rightward shift by the government, claiming MrMajor's cabinet reshuffle last July had promoted left of centre MPs.However, Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, rounded on MrPortillo, claiming the party had clearly taken an anti-European stanceand that Miss Nicholson's defection should be heeded. 'There is nodoubt at all that the party has moved to the right,' he said. 'Thatcan't be denied . . . it may be denied, but if it is denied it is afalse denial.'Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a pro-European backbencher, also demanded ahalt to the 'torrent of personal abuse' heaped on Miss Nicholson andcalled on ministers to rise above the warfare between the party'swings.'I would just like them to behave as if they were one cabinet, visiblefor all to see and not in such a way where undoubtedly the unhappinessproduced has led to two defections in three months. We cannot affordany more and I trust we will not have any more,' he said.Tory warning, Page 6Editorial Comment, Page 15[London Page 1]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996TAX SELF-ASSESSMENT WILL HIT SMALL BUSINESS, SAYS LABOUR   By JAMES BLITZThe Treasury's plan to allow self-employed managers of small businessesto assess their own income tax liabilities will come under a strongattack from the Labour party this week amid claims that it will addsignificantly to company costs.Labour claims self-assessment will place new burdens on smallbusinesses running into hundreds of millions of pounds. It estimatesthe scheme will create extra recurrent costs of Pounds 130m to Pounds250m a year for self-employed business managers and mean big increasesin red tape.Mr Andrew Smith, Labour's shadow chief secretary, is also concerned thescheme contains a 'hidden tax bombshell'. He said yesterday theintroduction of self-assessment later this year would increase theTreasury's tax take by some Pounds 850m in 1997-98.Labour is expected to raise its objections to the scheme in the Commonson Thursday when the Finance Bill is published.Mr Smith said the increase in tax revenue would occur because theself-employed would make their assessments next year on the basis ofcurrent-year activities rather than those for the previous year.Because of anticipated increases in inflation and economic growth, thechange to current-year assessment would allow the Treasury to take morein tax from the self-employed.'While the principle of self-assessment makes sense, the way thegovernment is going about it on the current deadlines is a disaster,'said Mr Smith.He revealed that Labour would call for aspects of self-assessment to bedelayed to avoid confusion.But Mr Smith would give no guarantee that Labour would abandon theself-assessment plans, arguing that a new government might create newdifficulties by reversing changes of such magnitude.A spokesman for the Inland Revenue confirmed that the government wouldreceive the additional Pounds 850m in 1997-98. But he said it was a'one-off shift' that would not be repeated in future years.'Overall, self-assessment amounts to a clearer system with moredefinite deadlines - and one which people will find easier to operate,'he said.[London Page 1]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF:BOXER ARRESTED AFTER FIREWORKS ACCIDENTFormer boxing champion Chris Eubank was arrested and released on bailafter two women were injured during a new year fireworks display heheld on Brighton's seafront.

Mr Clarke believes that the decisionto participate in a single currency is primarily an economic one.However, Mr Waldegrave said the decision to join was primarily 'an actof political will and choice'.He also hinted that Mr John Major's successful campaign to persuade theEU to study the implications of two-tier monetary union - with only asmall minority of countries joining the proposed single currency - ismotivated by a desire to delay the project.'I do think that it is possible to imagine technical questions whichwill be raised which will worry those who are going in very much,' MrWaldegrave said. 'The damage from a badly established union will bequite considerable.'The chief secretary also made it clear that he will contest anycriticism he may face in the Scott report on arms sales to Iraq, due tobe published in the next few weeks. Leaked drafts of the reportcriticised Mr Waldegrave for failing as a Foreign Office minister inthe late 1980s to announce an apparent softening in the government'spolicy on the arms embargo with Iraq.Mr Waldegrave, who has made further submissions to Lord Justice Scott,said: 'My conscience is entirely clear.' He would only considerresigning if he could be persuaded that his 'memory of the wholebusiness is so wrong'.He added that it would not only be his memory that was at fault butthat of 'the whole Foreign Office'.On next year's public expenditure negotiations, he said he would startvisiting ministries with a view to securing cuts in the early spring.One of the initial targets of his scrutiny will be the Pounds 15bn costto government of public bodies at arm's length from ministries andquangos. He said he was looking for savings of several hundred millionpounds in their running costs. He will also maintain pressure onspending departments to substitute private finance forgovernment-financed capital projects. 'In terms of extra cash flowthere is probably more to come from that,' he said.His other target will be to step up the government's fight againstfraud, especially in the social security budget.Waldegrave's aims, Page 6[London Page 1]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996AILING KING FAHD HANDS OVER POWER TO SAUDI PRINCE: MOVE ENDSSPECULATION OVER SUCCESSION BUT FUELS DOUBT ON RULER'S HEALTH   By ROULA KHALAF, Middle East CorrespondentSaudi Arabia's King Fahd handed over the running of the governmentyesterday to his half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, in a developmentlikely to raise further doubts about the king's health but endspeculation about succession in the kingdom.A royal order carried by the official Saudi Press Agency said the73-year-old monarch, who is believed to have suffered a minor strokelast November, was handing over 'management of government affairs' tothe crown prince while he recuperates.Prince Abdullah, who is two years younger than the king, is deputyprime minister and head of the powerful 57,000-man National Guard. Heis seen as more conservative and less internationally minded than theking, though diplomats said he was unlikely to change the kingdom'sforeign and economic policies.Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter and a close ally ofthe US. The decree said the prince would take over while the kingenjoyed 'rest and recuperation'.The decision makes official a role the prince has played since the kingfell ill.Although he will officially now chair cabinet meetings and representthe king on official visits, the move may prove temporary if the king'shealth improves, diplomats said yesterday.'It sounds more like a technical move, a kind of regency,' said onediplomat in the kingdom. 'The king is still king. What we don't know ishow much he will still be involved and this will depend on his health.'The king left hospital on December 8 after suffering what wasofficially termed a 'sudden indisposition' but is known to have been astroke.Diabetic and overweight, King Fahd was seen on television yesterdayaided by a walking stick as he received Crown Prince Abdullah andPrince Sultan, the defence minister.Saudi officials yesterday suggested the move was aimed at putting anend to speculation of a power struggle within the kingdom.The talk had been fuelled in recent months by two big shocks. The firstwas the monarch's illness, the second a car bomb on November 13 whichdestroyed a US-staffed Saudi National Guard communications centre inRiyadh, the capital.Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the regime have latched on to theseevents from their base in London and claimed a power struggle hasbroken out in the royal family.They viewed the bomb attack on the national guards as an attempt toundermine Crown Prince Abdullah.Yesterday's move preceded the unveiling of Saudi Arabia's 1996 budget.Early indications suggested the kingdom would continue public sectorretrenchment, maintaining expenditures at SR150bn (Pounds 25.8bn), thesame as in 1995.Faced with a cash crunch resulting from the collapse of oil prices andthe cost of the 1990-91 Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has since 1994 embarkedon a policy of cutting government expenditures and raising non-oilrevenues.Conservative Abdullah takes reins of power, Page 3[London Page 1]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996CHIRAC CONCEDES DIALOGUE NEEDED ON REFORMS   By ANDREW JACK   PARISMr Jacques Chirac, the French president, made a sharp break with thepractice of his predecessor, Mr Francois Mitterrand, on Sunday night byraising the political content of the country's traditional New Year'sEve address from its head of state.In an address lasting nearly 15 minutes and broadcast on mosttelevision news channels, Mr Chirac devoted much of his time todefending his decisions over the last few months and how they tied into his election campaign promises.He made patriotic play of France's historical mission and globalimportance, and its continued commitment to brotherhood, tolerance andjustice.Referring to the widespread strike action since last November, whichwas prompted by his government's proposed social security reforms, hecalled the resulting period one of 'crisis'.In his strongest statement of support for Mr Alain Juppe, he praisedthe 'courage and determination' of the prime minister, as well as therest of the government.However, in a sign of implicit criticism, he said that one lesson to bedrawn from the experience was the need for greater dialogue andconsultation - something which he acknowledged had not beencharacteristic of France in the past.Another lesson - in a jibe at his political predecessors - was that 'itis no longer possible to govern as we have for the last 20 years' withonly piecemeal reforms. He stressed the need for a country able to copewith 'global competition'.He said his aim remained to build a 'new France' based on justice,unity and resonsibility, and his top priority remained to reduceunemployment - which remains at more than 11.5 per cent.He placed less emphasis than in a previous television interview lastOctober on fiscal rigour, but talked about the need to set up acreative, productive economy. He pledged that taxes - which have risensince his election - would be cut as soon as possible.President Chirac made time to discuss the French commitment to Europe -a point brought home by the EU's flag hanging alongside that of his owncountry on the wall behind him.However, he also stressed the need for change in the administration ofthe EU so that it was 'more attentive' to the daily needs of theFrench, including their 'social hopes' and the 'real priority' ofemployment.[London Page 2]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996SCALFARO SEEKS CLARITY ON POLLS   By ROBERT GRAHAM   ROMEPresident Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has appealed to Italy's politicalparties to come forward with clear ideas on how long the government ofMr Lamberto Dini should last and to give a firm calendar for the lifeof the current parliament.The head of state's appeal was contained in his annual messagedelivered on New Year's eve.The highly political message was delivered in advance of this week'smeeting of the parliamentary group leaders to fix the terms of a debateon the future of the government following the resignation tendered lastSaturday by Mr Dini, the prime minister.As expected President Scalfaro rejected the resignation, insistingparliament must decide. In his message, President Scalfaro reinforcedthis point. 'In a few days the debate in the chamber of deputies willprovide the right opportunity to know precisely what the variouspolitical groups want and to see whether a consensus emerges that isboth clear to the general public and useful to the head of state.'The debate is likely to be staged next week, allowing further time forthe political leaders to negotiate behind the scenes. Until now none ofthe main political parties has come forward with a proposal either forthe continuance of the Dini government or a date for general elections.But Mr Dini, who has been in close touch with the main party leaders,appeared confident over the weekend that he would remain in office.Backed by President Scalfaro, he has argued strongly that the countrycannot afford a government crisis and a general election during Italy'ssix-month presidency of the European Union which lasts until June.Despite underlining the importance of parliament, the tone throughoutPresident Scalfaro's 35-minute New Year's message was of a man whointended to use his limited constitutional powers to the full. He madehis own preferences plain.He went out of his way to praise the 11 month premiership of Mr Dini -so indicating his desire to see the former deputy director of the Bankof Italy remain at the helm during Italy's EU presidency. He also saidhe would like to see the current legislature carry out a proper reformof the constitution in time for the celebration in 1998 of the 50thanniversary of its introduction. This was seen as a none too subtlehint that parliament should not be dissolved before institutionalreform has been tackled.Yesterday several political parties took exception to what theyregarded as President Scalfaro's overtly partisan stance. In particularthe president's message was attacked by the rightwing NationalAlliance, by the Greens and by Reconstructed Communism, which wasformed from the hardline members of the former Communist party.Editorial comment, Page 15[London Page 2]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996SAMPAIO LEADS AS PORTUGAL NEARS VOTE   By PETER WISE   LISBONCampaigning for Portugal's presidential election on January 14 beganthis week with Mr Jorge Sampaio, the Socialist candidate, showing aclear lead over Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister for 10 yearsuntil his centre-right Social Democrats were beaten in October'sgeneral election.Mr Sampaio, a former Socialist party leader who stepped down as mayorof Lisbon to run for the presidency, was given 41.6 per cent of thevote in a newspaper poll yesterday, compared with 34.9 per cent for MrCavaco Silva. A weekend poll based on a broader sample of more recentinterviews gave them 50 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.Since the return of democracy in 1974, Portugal has consistentlyelected presidents from the party opposed to the government so thateach acts as a counterweight to the other. Mr Cavaco Silva says thatPortugal will 'capsize' if all political weight is shifted to theSocialists, who are also dominant in local government.However, the polls indicate that most voters are inclined to provideadditional support for the Socialists, who are four seats short of aparliamentary majority, by electing Mr Sampaio. Under Portugal's 'semi-presidentialist' constitution, the president has the power to dissolveparliament and call an early election when governments run intodifficulties.Mr Antonio Guterres, the prime minister, is campaigning for the backingof a Socialist president. This would help his minority government meetelection commitments both to spend more on social reforms and exercisethe budgetary discipline required to meet the convergence targets forEuropean economic and monetary union.Ministers say Mr Cavaco Silva would seize the first opportunity todismiss the government if he won the election, although he has pledgedto co-operate fully with the Socialists in the interests of stability.The former prime minister's attempt at a transition from an aloofdecision-maker to the kind of benevolent figure of tolerance andconcern that Mr Ma rio Soares, the outgoing Socialist president, hasmade popular is proving difficult to achieve.Despite popular respect for his integrity, support for Mr Sampaio, aless charismatic leader, appears to be based more on disapproval of hisrival, whose government had grown increasingly unpopular before itsdefeat, and on backing for Mr Guterres.The government is avoiding decisive measures, including thepresentation of the 1996 budget, until after the presidential vote. Ithopes the political honeymoon that followed its election can beprolonged long enough to benefit Mr Sampaio.[London Page 2]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996RUSSIA PLEDGES TOUGH LINE ON ECONOMY   By JOHN THORNHILL   MOSCOWRussia's economics ministry yesterday pledged it would continue topursue a harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy andcut the monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent despite thestrong anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentaryelections.However, the ministry's tough stance, contained in an annual economicforecast, was seemingly at odds with the the softer rhetoric employedby President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year'sEve.'The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who today are poorshould begin to live better,' he said, promising the government wouldrectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which hascaused great social distress.Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in financial circles whichwas responsible for diverting money intended for social spending.Last week, Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employingrhetoric reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce 'saboteurs' whowere responsible for undermining the reform programme.He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them forsavings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that thegovernment may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing upinflation early this year. The government may come under intensepressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoralfavour before the presidential election in June.But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradictionbetween tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.[London Page 2]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996PARTIES WEIGH UP RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY   By ROBERT GRAHAMPolitical decisions in Italy are rarely made in a hurry.No one wishes to assume the responsibility - and risk - of the firstmove. This is why the politicians will take their time in deciding thefate of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's government even though they havehad ample notice of the administration's limited duration.Mr Dini tendered his resignation on Saturday to President Oscar LuigiScalfaro, after approving an additional financial package for the 1996budget. This was his last self-appointed task.President Scalfaro has now thrown the responsibility back to parliamentto decide what should happen next. This will take the form of aparliamentary debate later this week or early next week.Having acquired a taste of power over the last 11 months, Mr Dini ismore than willing to stay on. Moreover, President Scalfaro, who has thefinal say on a date for the next general election, is clearly anxiousthe former director general of the Bank of Italy should remain inoffice.President Scalfaro believes it is too late for a big political shake-upnow that Italy has the responsibility (since January 1) of thepresidency of the European Union. He thus wants Mr Dini to remain primeminister - probably with a revamped cabinet - for the duration of thesix-month presidency. But this seems to be part of a broader strategyby Mr Scalfaro, a former Christian Democrat interior minister, to allowparliament to survive until 1997, thus permitting more time for arecreation of the centre grouping which dominated post-war Italianpolitics until 1992.The parliamentary debate is expected to focus on three broad scenarios:Mr Dini heads the government to ensure a stable EU presidency andpermit elections around June.Mr Dini presides over a caretaker government with elections held inlate February or early March.A broad-based government is formed lasting up to two years to permit aprogramme of big institutional reforms.The first scenario involves several variations. For instance, Mr Dinicould seek to maintain the backing of the centre-left parties, headedby the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) who supported his governmentof non-parliamentarians all last year. This would provide a fragilemajority in parliament unless a prior understanding was reached withthe rightwing alliance headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the former primeminister. The government would be little more than a caretaker, whilethe parties indulged in a six-month election campaign.Alternatively Mr Dini, who has no political base of his own, could tryto broaden the backing for the government to include the small centreparties in the rightwing alliance. This would have the advantage oflessening the exposure of the centre-left as the government's mainbacker and would provide some chance of parliament pushing through afew reforms in the next few months. It would also help offset thedestabilising effect of the populist Northern League, which, withalmost 80 deputies, retains considerable power to swing votes.The second scenario is straight-forward and would mean parliament beingdissolved shortly after the debate on the government's future. Mr Diniwould remain in office but with no real executive power. Given that itnormally takes a good six weeks to two months to form a governmentafter an election, Italy would be without an effective administrationprobably until May.The third scenario is the most complex. At a minimum it would require acommitment from the PDS, some of the centre parties and the bulk of MrBerlusconi's rightwing alliance to back the idea of carrying out overthe next two years important institutional reforms such asstrengthening the prime minister's position and ending the duplicationof the bicameral system. This would be done either by allowing a'technical' government to continue as the executive while a specialbicameral commission was formed to draw up the reforms; or a newgovernment would be formed, drawing ministers from the partiessupporting it. The onus would then be on the government to draw up thereforms.Mr Berlusconi has been exploring this idea of a broad-based governmentover the Christmas break. His scheduled trial later this month forcorruption probably played a part in his change of mind. But the PDS issceptical of his chances, and the rightwing National Alliance (AN), hismain ally, is openly hostile to the idea. The parties themselves arechanging too fast for a broad-based alliance to survive and be useful.The PDS has the power to force elections simply by refusing to continuebacking Mr Dini; but of late Mr Massimo D'Alema, the party leader, hasdropped his insistence on an early vote. This is because thePDS-dominated centre-left is increasingly divided on strategy and besetby doubts about being led in an election by the uncharismatic Mr RomanoProdi, the Bologna academic and former head of Iri, the state holdingcompany.The centre-left staked much on striking an electoral deal with amovement headed by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the former Milan magistrate.But Mr Di Pietro may now be prevented from entering politics because ofhis own problems with the law that have arisen as a result ofinvestigations over his abuse of office before he joined the Milanmagistrates' anti-corruption team.Against this background, the simplest option for the political partiesis to allow Mr Dini to stay with the excuse that Italy needs anidentifiable government to play its full role as EU chairman. This is aconvenient fig-leaf behind which the politicians can hide theirconfusion. But it will merely postpone the day of reckoning at theballot-box and is unlikely to provide an authoritative government, evenif Mr Dini has proven to be a skilled and ambitious operator of thesystem.[London Page 2]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996PACT TO OPEN UP STATE CONTRACTS   By GUY DE JONQUIERES   LONDONPublic procurement contracts valued at several billion dollars a yearwill be thrown open to international competition under a World TradeOrganisation agreement which took effect yesterday.The agreement covers more countries and purchasers - and applies to awider range of contracts - than existing rules agreed under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 15 years ago.In addition to covering services for the first time, the new rulesextend to procurement by sub-central purchasers, such as states,provinces, departments and utilities, as well as to centralgovernments.Though not all WTO members are obliged to participate in the agreement,it has been ratified by more than 20 governments, including the US, theEuropean Union's 15 members, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland.Singapore and several other countries plan to subscribe to it.The accord excludes defence contracts, EU telecoms and the US regionaland urban public transport sector.The complex new rules set a variety of thresholds, denominated inSpecial Drawing Rights, above which contracts must be opened tocompetition. The threshold for central government procurement isSDR130,000 (Pounds 125,000), for sub-central purchasers aboutSDR200,000, and for utilities roughly SDR400.000.The agreement also lays down specified tendering procedures, to ensurethat foreign bidders and foreign goods and services are treated on thesame basis as those in the purchaser's home country.[London Page 2]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996GENE CLONING RAISES HOPES   By DANIEL GREEN   LONDONA gene that has been linked with obesity has been cloned, a step thatbrings closer a new generation of treatments for the chronicallyoverweight.Two companies, Millennium of the US and Roche of Switzerland, describethe cloning - effectively the manufacture - of the 'ob' gene in thelatest issue of the journal Cell.The ob gene triggers the manufacture of a protein, leptin, which lastyear was been shown to affect the weight of mice with no significantside effects.

In Soviet times, Russia's voterscould vote for only one party whose political philosophy was force-fedto them from birth. In last month's parliamentary elections they had achoice of 43 parties with each one claiming to have the only answer toRussia's woes.Such a drastic democratic upheaval has clearly left many Russiansbewildered and may help explain why more than one-fifth of them optedfor the familiar and voted for the return of the Communists. But theelections also proved an education for Russia's political leaders whoare now scrambling to learn the lessons before the all-importantpresidential elections scheduled in six months' time.The Magnitogorsk Worker, the local newspaper for the Urals industrialtown founded as part of Stalin's industrialisation drive, encapsulatedmany of the confusions and controversies that came to dominate thecampaign. In so doing it reflected, in microcosm, the social pain andideological uncertainties that continue to bedevil Russia.The newspaper, founded in 1930 and still proudly bearing a Sovietemblem on its front page urging the proletariat of the world to unite,provided full, lively, and generally fair coverage of the campaign,encouraging those who see the media as an important factor in thedevelopment of a healthy civil society.Like most of Russia's local newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker couldhave been under enormous pressure from many quarters. The list of sixparliamentary candidates for the city seat included the deputy head ofthe local administration and a director of the steel combine whichemploys 60,000 workers and dominates the region's economy.But Mr Georgy Tikhonov, the chief editor, argued that the newspaper'srole was simply to provide an objective forum for the debate andencourage readers to participate in the vote. 'This newspaper does notagitate for or against particular candidates. . . it agitates forsomething else: for the widest possibility for people to discuss openlyone or another candidacy and the course of the campaign itself. Read,think, and make your choice]' the newspaper stated.In comparison with most western newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Workerprovided few reports and opinions from its journalists but carriedextensive personal contributions from the candidates and scores ofletters from its readers.Mr Alexander Pochinok, the incumbent deputy who represented the thenpro-government Russia's Choice party in the previous vote in 1993, wasthe dominant figure in the campaign for one of Russia's 225directly-elected seats.Although he supported the government's harsh monetary policies whichmany critics blamed for Russia's social ills, Mr Pochinok boldlylaunched his campaign by concentrating on social problems and promisingto improve the lot of the elderly.But his attempt to seize the mantle of social concern was fiercelycontested by the Communist candidate who wrote an emotional tiradeagainst the government's policies and promised a restoration of thecertainties of the Soviet era.These themes were echoed in the opinions of the newspapers' readers whoexpressed impassioned and disparate views.'During the war, millions were evacuated here and resettled. They weregiven work and a roof but now they have been thrown out. Every honestperson will vote for the Communists,' said one.'I do not want to return to the miserable plague-stricken camp of thepast but I fear the thorny road forward to civilisation,' commentedanother.One reader planned not to participate in the elections at all giventhey were merely a 'political spectacle distracting the country fromits true problems' while another condemned the newspaper itself forgiving too much space to the 'so-called democrats'.The Magnitogorsk Worker made clear it was aware of some dirty electoraltactics during the campaign but did not identify who was responsiblefor them in order not to prejudice opinions.In the week before the vote, it carried an item about a pensioner whohad been contacted by someone claiming to represent the local telephonecompany.'Vote correctly and your telephone bill will be paid in advance for ayear,' the mysterious caller promised.On the eve of the elections, the newspaper urged its readers to go tothe polls although it recognised that many voters were still confusedby the extraordinary range of parties on the ballot paper.The results were slow to trickle in and the Magnitogorsk Worker did notpublish the preliminary outcome until three days after the poll. Theelectors of Magnitogorsk had returned the pro-market Mr Pochinok astheir local candidate but they had also lodged a strong protest votebacking Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democraticparty and the Communists in the simultaneous ballot for the seatsassigned on the basis of proportional representation.In all, 39 parties - including Russia's Choice - failed to garnermore than the 5 per cent of the vote required to win any of the 225seats in the 450-strong parliament allocated by proportionalrepresentation. Mr Pochinok, for example, has been elected as arepresentative of a party which will be unable to form its own factionin parliament.One voter told the newspaper: 'Voting is most democratic. But you mustwrite that Hitler also came to power in Germany by democratic means. Wemust go forward to the presidential elections but people must bevigilant.'[London Page 2]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996ZEROUAL PICKS LITTLE-KNOWN DIPLOMAT AS PM   By ROULA KHALAFAlgerian President Liamine Zeroual has chosen a little-known careerdiplomat as the country's new prime minister.Mr Zeroual, elected president in November, on Sunday named Mr AhmedOuyahia, his 43-year-old head of cabinet, to replace Mr Mokdad Sifi whohad been asked to stay on until the end of the year.Most Algerians met Mr Ouyahia, who comes from the Berber province ofTizi-Ouzou, for the first time when he appeared on state televisionlast July to read a statement telling them that the last round of talkswith the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had collapsed. The FIShas been battling the government since 1992. Mr Ouyahia is not believedto have taken a lead part in the negotiations.That he is among the youngest prime ministers the country has knownpoints to an attempt by Mr Zeroual to reach out to a younger generationin a country where more than 70 per cent of the people are under theage of 30. But Mr Ouyahia's appointment sheds little light on MrZeroual's post election politics.'Zeroual has opted for a safe pair of hands, a skilled functionaryrather than a political heavyweight,' said one Algerian expertyesterday. 'It means the composition of the government is not whatreally concerns him.'Mr Ouyahia's government is not expected to last longer than a yearbecause Mr Zeroual has promised legislative elections, although he hasyet to commit himself to a specific date.The prime minister's task will centre on overseeing economic reformsagreed with the International Monetary Fund and preparing for theelections.Mr Ouyahia is perhaps best known among his colleagues for arranging anaccord to end the conflict between Tuareg rebels and the Maligovernment in 1992, a task which won him recognition as a skilfulnegotiator.He was named ambassador to Mali to oversee implementation of theaccord, before becoming state secretary for co-operation and Maghrebaffairs in 1993.Although some experts have suggested the choice of a diplomat withnegotiating skills points to a determination on the part of thepresident to seek national reconciliation, any negotiations with theFIS or other opposition parties which opposed the presidential electionare likely to be conducted directly from the president's office ratherthan that of the prime minister.In a system in which the presidency enjoys wide powers, the primeminister's office is entrusted with more of a management role.[London Page 3]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996JAPAN PUBLIC PRESSED ON LOAN BAILOUT   By GERARD BAKER   TOKYOMr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minster, has urged an increasinglysceptical Japanese public to accept the government's plan to spend morethan Y685bn (Pounds 4.37bn) in bailing out the country's failed housingloan companies.In a New Year message to the nation, Mr Murayama signalled the start ofwhat is likely to be a fierce political struggle over the bailout inthe new parliamentary session which begins later this month.The prime minister acknowledged the unpopularity of the plan, whichwill cost every individual in the country at least Y5,500, but said ithad been an unavoidable and 'painful' decision.He promised a full investigation into the causes of the failure of theseven companies. 'I will try from now on to shed light on the entireproblem,' he added.Last month the cabinet agreed to allocate Y685bn from next year'sbudget to pay for the cost of partially reimbursing creditors of thebankrupt housing lenders. The government also committed itself tospending more if the final costs of liquidation turn out to be greaterthan is forecast.The companies, which were established by the leading banks in the1970s, are on the verge of collapse under a pile of nonperforming loanswhich were advanced mostly in a bout of reckless lending to theproperty sector during the bubble economy of the late 1980s.Popular opposition to the principle of spending taxpayers' money hasescalated since the decision was announced and will be exploited byopposition parties when the parliamentary discussion of the nationalbudget begins at the end of January.Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected leader of the main opposition NewFrontier party, signalled his determination at the weekend to opposethe bailout if the government did not provide a satisfactory anddetailed account of who was responsible for the costly mess.The government has already attempted to propitiate the public's angerby hastily removing the senior bureaucrat at the ministry of finance,Mr Kyosuke Shinozawa. Mr Shinozawa, the administrative vice ministerfor finance, resigned last week, in part to take responsibility for thehousing loan problem.But the opposition wants the blame for the fiasco to be spread muchmore liberally among both politicians and bureaucrats.In its sights are Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, and mostintriguingly, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the international trade ministerand leader of the Liberal Democratic party, the largest coalitionpartner. Mr Hashimoto was finance minister during the period when mostof the reckless lending of the housing loan companies was undertaken.In 1990 the finance ministry issued guidelines to all financialinstitutions to curtail their lending to property-related companies.But the instructions did not apply to the housing lenders whichcontinued to pour money into highly speculative real estate projects.The finance ministry has promised a full inquiry into the circumstancesof the housing lenders' demise, and has promised that those foundresponsible, bankers, politicians and bureaucrats, will be held toaccount.But even a spate of resignations may not prove enough in the currentpolitical heat. Many members of the socialist party, the second largestcoalition member, are profoundly unhappy about the bailout, as are someofficials in the finance ministry.If the political pressure intensifies, some members of the coalitionmay break ranks and oppose the deal.Defeat for the government on such a crucial part of its budget plansfor 1996 would have potentially disastrous consequences for itsviability.[London Page 3]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996INDONESIA'S CONGLOMERATES LOOK TO MARKET FORCES   By GREG EARL   JAKARTAIndonesia's big conglomerates, long regarded as 'crony capitalists'receiving government favours, are becoming much more dependent onmarket forces for their growth, according to a study.The study of sales and asset growth of the country's top groups,conducted by the Indonesian Business Data Centre, a private agency,also shows that 300 businesses are responsible for about half thecountry's gross domestic product.The centre's director, Mr Christianto Wibisono, said the study showed adistinct move away from reliance on government-awarded licences forbusiness growth in Indonesia. He said only 27 of the groups were nowdependent on managed trading and monopoly arrangements although many ofthe larger groups had been established under those business conditions.The 300 groups are estimated to have increased sales by 15 per cent in1994 to Dollars 74bn (Pounds 48bn).The figures point to some increased concentration in the hands of thelargest groups with the 10 largest recording a 17 per cent increase insales to Dollars 26bn. There were 31 groups with total sales of Dollars350m, accounting for 55 per cent of total sales, whereas in 1993 therewere estimated to have been 24 groups with that level of salesaccounting for 49 per cent of total revenue.Concentration is more evident on an assets basis with 56 groupscontrolling three quarters of the Dollars 118bn in total assets of the300 businesses.The dominance of the economy by people of Chinese descent is underlinedby the fact that only 79 of the 300 groups are owned by ethnicIndonesians and 203 by non-ethnic Indonesians, predominantly Chinese.While there are few surprises among the company's largest companies,several new players are fast emerging, with 11 groups estimated to havegrown by 50 per cent in 1994.[London Page 3]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996CONSERVATIVE ABDULLAH TAKES REINS OF POWER   By ROULA KHALAFSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who was yesterday entrusted withthe running of the government by his half-brother King Fahd, has beendescribed as more conservative than the king, less likely toaccommodate the west and possibly prone to pumping less oil to raiseprices.However, as experts and diplomats were quick to point out, Saudi Arabiarun by the crown prince is likely to follow the same economic andforeign affairs policies the west has become accustomed to under KingFahd.If the king's health improves, the handing over of the running of thegovernment may be no more than a temporary measure and, until CrownPrince Abdullah takes over for good, King Fahd will continue to havethe final word on big decisions.One of more than 30 surviving sons of the late King Abdul Aziz, the71-year-old crown prince is known as a traditional bedouin who enjoysimportant ties to the tribes of Saudi Arabia. The fact that he had adifferent mother from the king's other powerful brothers has meant thathe comes from a less prominent branch than the other sons of King AbdulAziz.But as the closest in age to King Fahd, he was named crown prince whenthe latter took over in 1982. Although this has been a source ofrivalry with the rest of the clan, the sons of Abdul Aziz are known tostick together when times get rough.The crown prince is well respected and known for a stutter which seemsto disappear when giving public speeches. The bedouin base is his mainsource of strength. Since 1963, he has commanded the National Guard, alargely bedouin force which looks after internal security and acts ascounterweight to the army.In view of his strong links to Syria and the Palestinians, as well as areported reluctance to allow American troops to set up their base inSaudi Arabia during the 1990 Gulf war, the crown prince is believed tobe less internationally minded than his half-brother. He is not knownto speak English, for example, and has played a role in cultivatinglinks with the Arab world.This, however, say diplomats, is unlikely to have a bearing on theKingdom's close ties to the west, especially the US. 'The US allianceis a vital strategic alliance which the Saudis will not do much tochange,' a diplomat said.Moreover, according to Saudi observers, the crown prince played aprominent part in drumming up public support within the Kingdom for theGulf war.'He is more decisive than the king but less reflective perhaps,' saidone veteran Saudi observer who knows the crown prince. 'The king isvery cautious and tends to see procrastination as a virtue. Abdullah isless hesitant in his style and quicker to judge.'Such a style, said the observer, may translate into more forcefuldealings with Islamic fundamentalists who have bombarded the kingdomwith faxes from a propaganda base in London.Islamic dissidents are also suspected of having perpetrated theNovember 13 bomb attack on a US-staffed Saudi National Guardcommunications centre in Riyadh.As the budget unveiled yesterday suggests, economic reforms started in1994 will continue. Faced with collapse of oil prices, Saudi Arabia hashad to clamp down on spending in recent years, give the private sectora larger role and boost non-oil revenues.In an address to the nation, Crown Prince Abdullah said: 'No doubt youknow the financial situation that emerged from the (1991) Gulf war andthat your government had (earlier) promised to continue its treatmentso matters could return to what they used to be - strength andbalance.'The kingdom in recent years has been committed to keeping crude outputat 8m barrels a day in order to avoid a repeat of the mid 1980s, whenit was faced with falling prices and falling production. Diplomats saidyesterday that the crown prince was in the 1970s believed to favour apolicy of holding back production.'I think the crown prince will continue the policy of keeping oilprices stable, and the kingdom cannot relax on the economic front butwill have to continue with reforms,' a diplomat said.As reforms are pursued, however, diplomats said that for as long as thecrown prince was only acting on behalf of the king, he would have tofind a way to accommodate the king's other prominent brothers tominimise friction.This may mean that he will resort to consultation and seek theco-operation of powerful members such as Prince Sultan, defenceminister and next in line of succession.[London Page 3]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996TALKS TO RESUME ON US BUDGET IMPASSE   By PATTI WALDMEIR   WASHINGTONUS President Bill Clinton will meet congressional Republican leaderslater today to resume talks on ending the protracted federal budgetdispute, after extended negotiations over the New Year weekend failedto yield agreement either on balancing the budget, or on the moreimmediate problem of ending the partial government shutdown.Mr Clinton and Republicans met throughout Saturday and Sunday, beforerecessing for New Year's Day. Both sides said no significant decisionswere taken during those negotiations, which focused on outlining areasof disagreement.But Mr Bob Dole, Senate majority leader, said negotiators were nowready to 'start making the tough decisions'. And there were signs ofsome flexibility from radical freshmen Republicans in Congress: severalof them, interviewed on weekend television programmes, made clear thatthey were willing to compromise on the Dollars 245bn (Pounds 159bn) taxcut included in their plan, saying balancing the budget was moreimportant than cutting taxes. Mr Clinton favours a much more modest taxcut.Mr Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said today's negotiationswould focus on 'trade-offs' between cuts in healthcare spending, taxesand welfare needed to balance the budget over seven years, as agreed byboth sides in November. There was no sign at the weekend that the twosides had resolved the basic philosophical dispute which underlies thebudget impasse: whether to shift power away from the federal governmentto the states, as the Republicans want; and whether to curb guaranteesof healthcare for the poor and elderly.Both issues are likely to influence the outcome of this year'spresidential election campaign, which will soon shift into top gearwith a concentration of state presidential primary elections inFebruary and March.Parallel efforts will resume today to solve the more immediate problemof getting federal employees back to work, and ending the shutdown,which has already lasted more than a fortnight.The President and First Lady spent New Year's Eve and Day away from thefrustrations of the budget impasse, celebrating with 1,000 friends atthe Hilton Head resort in South Carolina, where they attended atraditional New Year seminar to debate subjects such as 'morals,manners, and today's pop culture' and 'politics, media and the declineof civility'.[London Page 4]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996RHODES' HEIRS RETURN TO ZAMBIA'S COPPER MINES: AFTER 25 YEARS OFNATIONALISATION, BOARDROOMS IN JOHANNESBURG AND LONDON MAY AGAINDETERMINE THE FUTURE OF ITS MAIN INDUSTRY   By TONY HAWKINSCecil John Rhodes would have relished the irony.Twenty five years after Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding president,nationalised the country's copper mines, the government of PresidentFrederick Chiluba may be on the verge of taking the first step towardsmeeting its promise to put the industry back into the private sector.Negotiations with Anglo American Corporation for a feasibility studyfor the development of the Konkola copper mining project are close toconclusion, say industry officials.It would be a move as rich in symbolism as the 1969 take-over itself,seen at the time as heralding a new era for a country that was oncelittle more than a fiefdom of Rhodes' British South Africa Company.Rhodes' vision of the company blazing a commercial trail from the Capeto Cairo, in the name of an empire run by Englishmen, 'is now buried -I hope and pray, never to rise again in this part of Africa,' declaredMr Kaunda, architect of what turned out a disastrous socialistprogramme.Once again, however, boardrooms in Johannesburg and London coulddetermine the development of an industry still at the heart of Zambia'seconomy, accounting for more than 90 per cent of export earnings.With reserves at the Nchanga copper mine, which supplies ore to thestate-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), likely to beexhausted by the end of the decade, the government is under mountingpressure to give the go-ahead for the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)Konkola project.Although widely anticipated, the decision to invite the South Africanmining house, which has a 27.3 per cent stake in ZCCM, to prepare astudy and lead a consortium to develop the new mine will becontroversial, not just because Anglo American is being invited back.The Konkola decision will also have far-reaching implications for theprivatisation of ZCCM itself.While Zambia's privatisation programme has accelerated in the past year - by the end of September, 87 out of 217 business units had beenprocessed, resulting in a significant inflow of new investment andexpertise - progress in dealing with the politically sensitive coppermining industry has been slow.Whereas privatisation of dozens of small state-owned businesses haspassed off with little controversy, the sale of the crown jewels, inthe form of ZCCM, is a different matter, not least because Mr Kaunda isback on the campaign trail, preparing to contest next October'spresidential elections.United Nations Conference on Trade and Development figures, publishedlast month in the World Investment Report, estimate an inflow of morethan Dollars 350m in new foreign investment since the 1991 elections.In the last year a number of multinationals have returned to, orexpanded operations in, Zambia by buying state-owned companies.The list includes Tate & Lyle in sugar, Unilever and HJ Heinz in foodprocessing and toiletries, the Commonwealth Development Corporation incement and agriculture, South African Breweries in brewing and AngloAmerican in hotels.The net result is that Zambia attracted more foreign investment in1991/94 than any other sub-Saharan country, except oil exportersNigeria and Angola.Nevertheless, the announcement of ZCCM's privatisation just monthsbefore elections may seriously damage the prospects of Mr Chiluba'sMovement for Multiparty Democracy.The past four years of structural adjustment have been extremelypainful, with falling per capita incomes, rising unemployment, highinflation and interest rates and plummeting industrial production.That all of this was necessary to turn around an economy brought to itsknees by 27 years of mismanagement by Mr Kaunda's United NationalIndependence party (UNIP) may count for little when voters come to casttheir ballots.Economic reform would have paid dividends far more rapidly had theprivatisation programme, now beginning to show real results, beenimplemented both sooner and more efficiently; had the country not hadtwo droughts; and, most important, had the copper mines been able toexploit a period of strong demand and high prices.Figures for the first nine months of 1995 point to copper output ofabout 325,000 tonnes this year, down 8 per cent on 1994 and less thanhalf the average of over 700,000 tonnes a year in the late 1960s.In cost of production terms, ZCCM is in the top 10 per cent of globalproducers. Competitiveness will deteriorate further when costs grow asNchanga nears the end of its economic life, and the industry suffersfrom the cumulative effects of undercapitalisation, inadequate skills,reinvestment and maintenance spending, and weak management.If all goes to plan, Konkola will be developed as a joint venturebetween the government, whose contribution is likely to take the formof providing already existing smelting and refining capacity - therebyfurther weakening the rump of ZCCM itself - and a Anglo-ledconsortium, which may take some 60 per cent of the equity in thescheme.While such an arrangement makes sound commercial sense, it will leaveMr Chiluba open to the criticism of privatising ZCCM by stealth.An agreement in principle to develop Konkola, however, will reassure anincreasingly restive donor community.The response from the finance minister, Mr Ronald Penza, struck anequivocal note, speaking of the need for 'the utmost caution' inprivatising the mines.'We must have the necessary political support,' he said - which wasinterpreted by some donors as political shorthand for more delay.[London Page 4]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS-----------------------------------------------------------------------                       PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS-----------------------------------------------------------------------Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of1985.

'This isa war for peace, so there is no question that we have to find theresources for it.'The government estimates that the war against the Liberation Tigers ofTamil Eelam (LTTE) will cost Dollars 760m (Pounds 495m) this year, upfrom a provisional Dollars 640m in 1995.The seemingly unending fighting was felt by the tiny Colombo StockExchange, which shed 33 per cent of its value during 1995. Amid fallingforeign reserves, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 8 per centagainst the dollar in 1995.Yesterday the government lifted a ban on local banks raising capitalabroad, in an attempt to reduce domestic interest rates, which lastmonth galloped to 105 per cent amid a cash flow crisis.It is also raising telecommunications charges by 20 per cent, bus faresby 50 per cent and electricity tariffs by 20 to 100 per cent, dependingon the rate of consumption.However, Mr AS Jayewardena, the central bank governor, said theeconomic picture should improve in 1996, with foreign capital inflowsexpected to rise with the sale of state enterprises.The government is hoping to attract Dollars 420m in foreign capitalfrom privatisation, including the sale of the telecommunicationsoperator and the national airline, AirLanka. The projections areconsidered too optimistic by private analysts.Government politicians said the rising prices and the government'sfailure to turn the military success into a political victory hadturned initial enthusiasm into despondency.Despite the fall of Jaffna, the Tigers have shown that they are stillable to carry out spectacular guerrilla attacks using suicide bombers.Army camps and convoys have been targeted by lone Tiger guerrillasladen with explosives.Tamils who fled the fighting in Jaffna are sheltered in areas of thecountry's north still under rebel dominance. The Tigers say they willnot allow civilians to cross over to government-held areas of Jaffna,though defence analysts say that doing so would help the Tigers to gohome and revert to hit-and-run attacks against the army.The military on the other hand is ill-equipped to supply its35,000strong force in Jaffna because all land routes to the region aredominated by the rebels. They depend on the minuscule air force and thenavy.Mr Anuruddha Ratwatte, deputy defence minister, said the army wouldsoon open a land route to Jaffna. It would mean a fresh offensive thatwould cost many more lives, officials said, and the army was alreadybracing for it.[London Page 4]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996ZEDILLO RESHUFFLES CABINET   By DANIEL DOMBEY   MEXICO CITYA year to the day after he lost his finance minister in the fall-outfrom Mexico's botched devaluation, President Ernesto Zedillo last weekmade further changes to a government still struggling with theunpopularity unleashed by the currency crisis.Mr Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, who as energy minister was criticised forlinks to the old guard of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party,has been replaced, along with Ms Norma Samaniego, the country'scomptroller general, who was thought to be keeping too low a profile toget to grips with Mexico's allegedly rampant corruption. Mr CarlosSalomon, the head of Mr Zedillo's press office and frequent target ofcomplaints about the administration's news management at times whenspeculation about government changes unsettled the peso, has also beenremoved.The alterations leave key economic posts unchanged and do not indicateany big shift in strategy. While the new energy secretary, Mr JesusReyes Heroles, spent much of the previous administration advocating amore interventionist economic approach, the new comptroller general, MrArsenio Farell, helped push through the wage-labour pacts that thenprovided the centrepiece of economic policy.Mr Zedillo's supporters claim the alterations draw a line under thepolitical difficulties of the government's first year and set the stagefor further reform. But other observers deem the changes a tardyreaction to months of criticism.'This is a defensive move. It does not take the initiative as a morethorough going reshuffle would have done,' said Mr Juan Molinar, apolitics professor at El Colegio de Mexico, a graduate researchinstitution.Mr Zedillo does not face a nationwide electoral test untilcongressional elections due in 1997. But he can ill afford a repetitionthis year of 1995's election results, which saw the main right-wingopposition party establish control over roughly a third of localgovernment, and win three of five governorship elections.With the government predicting an economic recovery of only 3 per centgrowth this year, Mr Zedillo's new appointees will find themselves thefocus of added attention in their tasks of managing the government'srelationship with the press, reducing bureaucratic profligacy andreforming and attracting new investment to the country's energy sector.[London Page 4]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FT GUIDE TO 1996JANUARY1st Italy takes over the presidency of the European Union, the EU'scustoms union with Turkey starts, and Copenhagen begins its term asEuropean Cultural Capital.

Both are later than usualbecause of the Olympics. The main order of business for both is tocrown candidates for president and vice president, with the latterusually providing what suspense there is. But conventions, by alsoendorsing party platforms, can set a tone for the autumn campaign forthe White House.

They are intended to challenge Ford's Escort, Vauxhall's Astraand other similar-sized models in one of the biggest sectors of the UKnew car market. Fiat spent more than Pounds 1bn developing the newmodels.The models appear set to return the Fiat brand to the 4 per cent-plusmarket share levels not seen since the early 1980s. Mr James Blades,Fiat Auto UK's managing director, now expects final figures to showthat Fiat's market share in 1995 reached 3.6 per cent, with total salesapproaching 75,000 including about 3,000 Alfa-Romeo sales.Fiat's UK market share peaked in 1979 at 4.9 per cent, with sales ofLancia models at the time lifting the group's share above 5 per cent.Yet for much of the 1980s, its share slid downwards - mainly becauseof the parent group's failure to invest in new models. By 1992 it hadslumped to less than 2 per cent.So poor were Lancia sales that Fiat has stopped importing them to theUK altogether, while sales of Alfa-Romeo - bought by Fiat in 1987 -currently represent less than 0.2 per cent of the UK market.However, the launch of two small cars, the Punto and Cinquecento, hasalready brought about a strong revival. Mr Blades said: 'We are nowworking hard to ensure that further growth is stable and sustainable.That means making further inroads to fleets so as not to be subject tothe whims of private buyers.'Fiat's concern in this respect is illustrated by Society of MotorManufacturers and Traders statistics showing that the total new carmarket in the UK grew 2 per cent in the first 11 months of 1995. Withinthis total, fleet demand grew 7 per cent whereas sales to privatebuyers have stagnated.The importance of the fleet sector to manufacturers and importers isunderlined by the fact that around 47 per cent of new cars in 1996 areexpected to be bought by fleets.Fiat's sales to fleets in 1995 played a big part in its outperformanceof the new car market overall. At 67,400, Fiat's total sales in thefirst 11 months were 20 per cent higher than in the same period in1994, compared with only a 2 per cent rise in the UK new car marketoverall. Within the total, however, sales to fleets have jumped 43 percent. The importance of Bravo/Brava to Fiat's further UK growth isunderlined by the fact that the model segment in which they willcompete accounts for more than 30 per cent of the fleet market.Under the dealer restructuring, Fiat is retaining the overall size ofthe network at about 220 dealers but replacing many of the smaller,less committed outlets with facilities owned by the bigger retailinggroups.As a result of the shake-up, now in its final stages, some 30 per centof the network is owned by members of the UK's top 100 retailing groupswhich are capable of making the substantial investment that Fiat wantsto see.[London Page 6]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996POOREST DEPEND ON BENEFITS 'FOR 70% OF INCOME'   By GRAHAM BOWLEYThe poorest 20 per cent of households get almost three-quarters oftheir income from state benefits, government statisticians have found.Cash benefits made up 70 per cent of the gross income of the bottomfifth of Britain's households in the past financial year (1994-95),according to the Central Statistical Office's latest survey of economictrends.Taxes and government benefits trebled the share of total income of thepoorest 20 per cent of households, the study shows.Their share of total UK income grew from 2.3 per cent before taxes andbenefits to 6.9 per cent after taxes and benefits.Before tax, the top fifth of households earned 20 times more than thelowest fifth but only four times as much after taxes and benefits.The top 20 per cent of households paid 19.6 per cent of their grossincome in income tax compared with 11 per cent paid by otherhouseholds.State pensions accounted for almost three-quarters of the cash benefitsreceived by retired households, the study finds.The distribution of income before tax is more equal among those stillat work than those who have retired.But the distribution of after-tax income is more equal among retiredthan among working households.The CSO gives, for the first time, a regional breakdown of grossdomestic product and investment. This shows that in 1994 - the latestyear for which complete figures are available - the south-east, hometo 31 per cent of the population, accounted for about 36 per cent ofGDP.The north-west, which was the second most productive region, produced9.9 per cent of the UK's total GDP.Northern Ireland accounted for the lowest proportion of GDP at 2.3 percent.The south-east also had the highest GDP per capita at Pounds 11,407 perhead - compared with the UK average of Pounds 9,768.The lowest was Northern Ireland where it was Pounds 8,027 per head andWales where the figure was Pounds 8,274.But this gap is narrowing. Growth in GDP per head has been higher inNorthern Ireland than any other region since 1990.Income from employment was the source of more than 65 per cent of GDPin Scotland, whereas it accounted for less than 61 per cent in EastAnglia and the south-west.Economic Trends, No. 506, Central Statistical Office, Great GeorgeStreet, London SW1P 3AQ.[London Page 6]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996TORIES WARN OVER NICHOLSON ATTACKS   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby CorrespondentSenior left-of-centre Con-servatives yesterday warned the government totone down its attacks on Miss Emma Nicholson, the MP for Devon West andTorridge, following her defection to the Liberal Democrats last week.As her decision to quit the Conservatives continued to inflame thelong-running battle between leftwing and rightwing Tories, Mr PeterTemple-Morris, the MP for Leominster, condemned the 'torrent ofpersonal abuse' being heaped on Miss Nicholson. He argued that thecriticisms were not helping to settle pro-European Tory MPs in the wakeof her defection.In recent days Mr Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, hasclaimed that Miss Nicholson's departure followed her repeated andunsuccessful attempts to gain a ministerial post in the government.Mr Michael Portillo, the defence secretary, compounded the criticismyesterday by arguing that Miss Nicholson had 'demonstrated a history ofdisloyalty' - in part by deciding to vote against Baroness Thatcher inthe 1990 Conservative leadership contest.However, Mr Temple-Morris, a Euro-enthusiast who, ironically, is oftenassociated with Mr Heseltine's cause, warned that the attacks on MissNicholson were further damaging party morale.'If someone does defect from the party, then that is bad enough withoutpersonalising things,' he said. 'But ministers are creating a situationin which the public probably has some sympathy with her.'Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, attacked the language withwhich Mr Portillo had castigated Miss Nicholson, insisting thatministers needed to understand why she had made such a move.'This is what I regret, that members of the cabinet should be indulgingin this sort of language and this approach,' he told BBC Radio 4'sToday programme. 'We should be making sure that other people who haveanxieties should have those anxieties removed so the public should seewe are not a bitterly divided party, that we have pulled ourselvestogether and can work together.'Ministers were yesterday hoping that the circumstances of MissNicholson's move were exceptional and would not be followed by furtherdefections.But party whips will be heeding the recent claim by Mr Hugh Dykes, theMP for Harrow East, that a further six Tories could defect toopposition parties before the next general election. Mr Dykes, one ofthe most staunchly pro-European of Conservatives, will have his everymove watched closely by Tory whips in the next few months.Others whose names have been speculated upon as possible defectors areMr Temple-Morris; Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East; SirKeith Speed, MP for Ashford; Mr George Walden, MP for Buckingham; andMr Tim Rathbone, MP for Lewes.None of these has been prepared to admit that he is seeking to move toanother party. However, two of them - Mr Hicks and Mr Walden - haveindicated dissatisfaction with the direction of politics at Westminsterby announcing that they will not be standing at the next generalelection. Sir Keith Speed is also standing down at the next election.[London Page 6]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996SALES SUCCESS LESS SWEET AS CHEWERS AVOID SUGAR   By JOHN AUTHERSConsumers tried to cut down on their sugar in 1995, according to theannual survey for the chocolate and sweets markets carried out byCadbury Schweppes, the confectionery company.While Nestle's Kit Kat bar consolidated its lead over the Mars Bar -perceived as more fattening - in the chocolate market, the mostpopular sweet was Wrigley's Extra, a sugar-free chewing gum.Total consumption of chocolate declined slightly compared with 1994,from 530,000 tonnes to 526,000 tonnes, a trend which manufacturersattributed to the hot weather during the summer. But total spending onchocolate reached a new high of Pounds 3.2bn.Kit Kat sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 200m while those of Mars Barsfell 2 per cent to Pounds 150m.A report in June by Datamonitor, the market research company, said KitKat's share of the chocolate snack market had stayed at about 17.4 percent between 1990 and 1994, while the Mars Bar's share had dropped from16 per cent to 11.7 per cent.Mars made changes to its product in 1995 in an attempt to appeal towomen and to make its bars seem less fattening, introducing bite-sizedversions and changing the recipe to make it taste lighter.Cadbury's Dairy Milk consolidated its place as the third most popularchocolate.In the market for sweets, Wrigley's Extra gum finished ahead of Polomints and Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles, according to the annual review byTrebor Bassett, the sugar confectionery division of Cadbury's. Orbit byWrigley, another sugar-free gum, came fourth, well ahead of the betterknown Wrigley's Spearmint, which was 17th.The total size of the market was less than half that for chocolate,with total sales of Pounds 1.4bn and 283,000 tonnes sold. Averagespending per capita for the year was Pounds 24.The hot summer weather also affected sales of sweets, which includecough lozenges in the top 20, according to Trebor Bassett.

It says companies will also cut output as they try to sellthe stocks they built up in 1995.As a result, UK gross domestic product will grow by less than 2.5 percent in 1996 compared with 2.75 per cent last year. This predictionclashes with the official Treasury forecast of 3 per cent growth in1996.But growth will rebound in 1997 to 2.8 per cent, the forecasting groupsays. It thinks that spending by consumers will grow modestly in 1996and then expand strongly next year - partly because of expected taxcuts in the next Budget.Meanwhile, a survey of 2,000 businesses published today by Lloyds Bankshows that confidence is at its lowest level since the poll began in1992. For the first time, the survey shows an increase in thosebusinesses reporting cashflow problems and a slowdown in exportorders.Orders for goods and services continue to grow - but at the slowestrate since the second half of 1992. The poll shows that confidence hasdropped because economic growth has been disappointingly slow.Mr Michael Riding, the director of commercial banking at Lloyds Bank,said that although companies 'are still experiencing growth, they arehaving difficulty in coming to terms with managing in a low inflationeconomy. This, coupled with failed growth expectations, has made themsomewhat pessimistic - possibly unnecessarily'.Companies in the construction and retail sectors reported the slowestgrowth in orders, while manufacturing companies and hotels and cateringbusinesses reported strong growth. Companies told Lloyds Bank thatinvestment spending has slowed because of slower profit growth andincreased pressure on cashflow. However, Cambridge Econometricspredicts that investment will pick up in 1996 as the private financeinitiative fills much of the gap left by cuts in government capitalspending.The forecasting group says there is evidence of a build-up in stocks inthe motor vehicle, chemical and non-metallic mineral productindustries. It predicts that headline inflation will fall in the shortterm in response to lower mortgage interest rates, although theunderlying rate will remain broadly unchanged.In the longer term, headline inflation will rise to 3.7 per cent in1997 from 3.1 per cent at present.Absence of inflation, Page 14[London Page 6]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996WALDEGRAVE RESOLVES TO START EARLY: NEW YEAR AIMS INCLUDE PUSHING THEPFI AND TACKLING FRAUD   By ROBERT CHOTELike the arrival of Christmas in the shops, negotiations between theTreasury and government departments over public spending seem to getearlier every year.The detail of the last public spending round was published only a monthago, at the time of the Budget. But Mr William Waldegrave, the chiefsecretary to the Treasury, is already preparing for the openingskirmishes of this year's battle.Mr Waldegrave said in an interview with the Financial Times that heplanned to emulate his predecessor, Mr Jonathan Aitken, by looking atthe spending of larger departments in spring, before the hagglingproper gets under way.The Department of Social Security will come under particular scrutiny,according to Mr Waldegrave. Its Pounds 90bn budget next year will beWhitehall's largest by far, so it is bound to be an important target inany search for savings.'It is essential that they are feeling the full force of thepossibilities of new ways of doing things,' Mr Waldegrave said. 'PeterLilley has exciting things to say about how benefits can be deliveredin a few years' time. What the Treasury has to see is whether 'a fewyears' time' can be made any shorter.'Mr Waldegrave has been criticised by some MPs for allowing too big anincrease in the DSS's running costs during the last spending round. Buthe argues that some cuts have actually cost money by weakening controlof the benefit system.Mr Waldegrave said it was clear that the proportion of social securityclaimed fraudulently - estimated at between 5 per cent and 10 per centfor some benefits - was much larger than most observers had thought.He noted that a pilot scheme to issue some claimants in London withswipecards was already saving money. 'One of the things I have to doearly in the new year is see what is a practicable, do-able,non-fantastic programme here which might generate another few hundredmillion,' he said.Mr Waldegrave said there was also scope to push the private financeinitiative, which attracts private sector funds and expertise intopublic sector infrastructure projects.'One thing we have broken the back of this year is institutionalresistance to the PFI, although it only generates a saving for publicexpenditure in terms of delivering better value for money,' he said.Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, believes thateconomic activity may be slowed in the short term by an 'infrastructurehiatus' as private finance replaces direct public funding. But MrWaldegrave said he expected private money to be attracted more quicklythan the Treasury assumed in the Budget.There were no 'wonder drugs' which would deliver savings fromgovernment spending next year, Mr Waldegrave added. He ruled out theidea of taking a tougher line with the Department of National Heritagebecause of the extra revenue from the National Lottery.But Mr Waldegrave admitted he was attracted - although this was apersonal rather than a Treasury view - to the idea that artsorganisations could be funded through endowments. This would limit thecentralisation of public support for the arts, although it would notnecessarily save money.Mr Waldegrave said that in framing a long-term strategy for publicspending, it was unrealistic to aim for the low government shares ofnational income achieved in some Asia-Pacific countries.Nations such as the US, New Zealand and Switzerland were better rolemodels, implying a government share of national income of 35 per centor 36 per cent. Public spending stands at 42 per cent of nationalincome, compared with the formal target of less than 40 per cent.Mr Waldegrave said every chief secretary had the ambition of reaching astage where it was no longer necessary to hold public spendingnegotiations every year. He said it was worth investigating the ideathat departments could agree a tough settlement on the understandingthat their budgets were guaranteed for a number of years. But heconceded that departments would fear that a future chief secretarywould not feel bound by the pledge.So the annual ritual of the public spending negotiations remains withus. Every year departments will squeal about the pressure they areunder, and the chief secretary will proclaim one of the toughest roundsin living memory.[London Page 6]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996POLICY FOR TERRORISM INSURANCE UNDER ATTACK: AS THE IRA CEASEFIRE HASLITTLE EFFECT ON PREMIUMS, BUSINESSES QUESTION THE ROLE OF REINSURERPOOL RE   By RALPH ATKINSWhen the IRA bombed the City of London in 1992 and 1993, causing morethan Pounds 1bn in damage, businesses were thankful that anyone wasprepared to provide insurance against further attacks.With insurers set to exclude unlimited terrorism cover from commercialpolicies, the setting up of Pool Re - a state-backed 'reinsurance'company which would underwrite policies sold by conventional insurers- was seen as a sensible response.Nearly three years later, as many companies renegotiate policies duefor renewal, the mood has changed.Pool Re is criticised as expensive and inflexible. The Association ofInsurance and Risk Managers, which represents commercial insurancebuyers, reckons the high rates Pool Re charges are forcing companies tochoose between spending large amounts on terrorism cover - or riskgoing without.The IRA ceasefire has had a limited impact. Premium rates have fallen:a 20 per cent discount has been announced for next year. Pool Re alsocollects only 60 per cent of the policy premium at the start of theyear; the remaining 40 per cent is waived if total claims during theyear do not exceed a certain level (Pounds 75m in 1996).But terrorism cover used to be included in standard commercial propertypolicies at no additional cost. As Mr Leslie Lucas, Pool Re chiefexecutive, admits: 'Any policyholder is going to say that, if we oncehad it offered for nothing, any price is going to be too much.'There is also concern that the structure of Pool Re is preventing thedevelopment of an alternative terrorism insurance market.When Pool Re started in 1993 it had no capital and operated as amutual, pooling the resources of those who depended on its services. Itinsists member insurance companies only sell terrorism cover at ratesand on terms set by Pool Re. Premiums are pooled into an insurance fundwhich at the end of 1994 stood at Pounds 410m but is likely now to besubstantially higher. Because most insurers are Pool Re members,companies have little option but to buy Pool Re policies.Moreover, corporate groups cannot 'cherry pick' - buying insurancepolicies backed by Pool Re only for vulnerable properties. Apart fromsmaller sites, they have to buy cover for all or none.Rates are set according to formula varying by location. There is onlylimited scope for taking account of measures individual companies mighttake to reduce their exposure to terrorist attack.Mr Alan Gavaghan, the deputy chairman of insurance broker WillisCorroon, says: 'A lot of companies spend a lot of money on riskprevention action, not just things like sprinklers and shatter-proofwindows. They have put a lot of thought into it, but they are treatedin the same way as people with clapped-out warehouses.'Alternatives are available. Willis Corroon is one of five brokers whichcombined to provide terrorism insurance underwritten by syndicates atLloyd's of London which are not Pool Re members.Last month the facility was improved and policies paying out up toPounds 100m per terrorist attack are available. That means largecompanies could choose to insure just their most vulnerable properties.But the total amount of insurance coverage available is limited. Pricesmay also not be sufficiently attractive for companies to switch fromPool Re policies which provide unlimited cover. As Mr Jeremy Lowe, ofWillis Corroon, says: 'It is a viable alternative to Pool Re for thosewho want to be selective, rather than a competitor.'In spite of its criticism, the Association of Insurance and RiskManagers do not want to kill the idea of a pool.'The concept is a good one,' says Ms Ina Barker, executive director.'The premiums of the many pay for the claims of the few.' There is alsolittle sign that insurers and reinsurers are willing to return toproviding full terrorism cover without state back-up.The association's idea is that Pool Re should be funded by a flatcontribution, or levy, on all commercial property policies. That shouldallow a return to the automatic provision of terrorism cover. As fundsare built up by Pool Re - assuming there is no escalation of terrorism - there would be scope for contributions holidays.Potentially, Pool Re could evolve into a state-backed reinsurerproviding cover against other perils where the incidence is low butpotential costs could be catastrophic - London flooding is a possibleexample.The aim would be to achieve the basic principle of insurance -spreading big risks on the shoulders of many. Ms Barker says:'Terrorism insurance ought to be automatic for the benefit of society.'[London Page 7]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996BIG THAW LEADS TO WATER CUTS   By PRESS ASSOCIATIONThousands of homes throughout the UK were flooded and whole communitiesfaced water shortages yesterday as the Christmas freeze gave way to adramatic thaw, bursting water mains and domestic water systems.

More than 100,000 homes were affected and water tankers werebeing used in some areas.The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which is responsible for publichousing, dealt with more than 5,000 calls. Plumbers ran short ofmaterials and the executive had to arrange special openings of supplystores to allow work to continue. Vast quantities of water were lostbecause affected schools, factories and offices were closed for theholidays.Thousands of consumers in the Carmarthen area of west Wales spentyesterday without water because of a burst main taking supplies fromthe river Towy. In England North West Water brought in extra staff tocope with phone calls, and other areas affected by the thaw includedNorthumberland, Tyneside and Wearside, East Anglia, Essex, and Suffolk.Thames Water said customers were cut off at various times but teamswere working to restore services.[London Page 7]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996NEW YEAR PLAN CONDEMNED: SCOTTISH BANK HOLIDAYS   By PRESS ASSOCIATIONScottish nationalists yesterday attacked plans to bring Scottishbanking industry holidays into line with England. The move could makethis the last traditional new year holiday period north of the borderand set a precedent for other employers, warned Ms Anne McNair, theScottish National party's employment spokeswoman.Scotland has two new year bank holidays - January 1 and January 2 -whereas England and Wales have only January 1.Announcing SNP backing for a campaign by the main banking union Bifu,she said: 'Once again it seems that Scottish families and society aretaking second place to English clearing banks and the London StockExchange. Making Easter Monday a bank holiday instead of January 2, asis proposed, would make no sense since demand for banking services isfar greater at Easter than at new year.'[London Page 7]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996PLEA FOR HELP OVER FRAUD PROBE: NHS TRUSTS   By JOHN AUTHERSThe National Health Service Executive has written to all 458 NHS trustsasking them to co-operate with a police investigation into an allegedfraud by locum agencies.

'If he does so he will be brought into court,he will be prosecuted and he will be fined up to Pounds 50,000.'[London Page 7]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996THIS WEEK:NERVES BEGIN TO FRAY OVER BUDGET IMPASSE - DATELINE / WASHINGTON, ANGERTHE THE 'CLOWNS OF CONGRESS' IS RISING   By JUREK MARTINIt is probable that the US government will still not be fullyfunctioning again this morning - and it is not possible to ignore therising tide of public and personal disgust with the wilfulness of thoseon the right wing of the US Congress who have brought about this prettypass.Note, from the outset, where the finger of blame is pointed: not atPresident Bill Clinton, though he may have contributed to the overallbudget impasse and is reaping political benefit from it; nor at SenatorBob Dole, though the majority leader might have been more resolute instanding up to his party's vizigoths if he did not need them for hispresidential ambitions.No, responsibility lies squarely with those so convinced of their ownrectitude and so insulated from the real world outside theirconservative salons and support groups that they cannot understand thedamage they are doing - not only to those affected by the longest, ifpartial, closure of the federal government ever, but also, ultimately,to their own cause of balancing the budget in seven years.It is doubtful that the impact of the suspension of government businesswill lop more than a fraction of 1 per cent off GNP. Importantindustries and cities have not ground to a halt because 280,000 federalbureaucrats have been laid off. No college football game, the opiate ofthe New Year season, has been cancelled.There has been damage, however: to the civil servants, not exactly fatcats, unpaid for two weeks over Christmas; to small federal contractorsdependent on government; to the 20,000 people who apply for passportsevery day and the 23,000 who register with social security; and to thesmall towns and businesses that live off the seasonal trade of greatnational parks like Yosemite in California, where the adjacent MariposaCounty has declared itself a disaster area.They may not amount to a collective blip in the national statistics,but their livelihoods are affected - for months ahead - and all aresome politician's constituents. To judge by their comments in streamsof US media interviews, they are mostly mad with what they frequentlycall 'the clowns of Congress', and soon some poll will doubtlessmeasure their anger.Perhaps more serious for the congressional right is the offence theyhave given to the chattering classes, who, when aroused, can still domuch to shape public opinion. Nothing has offended them more than thedenial of unfettered access to the most comprehensive collection everassembled in one place of the works of Johannes Vermeer, the Dutchmaster, at the National Gallery here in Washington.Last week, Rusty Powell, the gallery's director, was able to open itsdoors by releasing Dollars 30,000 from a private donor fund earmarkedfor future exhibitions. This was enough to make the Vermeers - but notthe rest of the formidable standing collection, nor the concurrentWinslow Homer exhibition - available to the public. And did they come,with lines in frigid weather stretching round the block for preciouspasses.But the money is only good for a week, which means that unless Congresscomes up with funding for the gallery pronto, the Vermeer exhibitioncannot complete its scheduled run until next month. And, like the smallbusinessmen in Mariposa County, just about all the gallery-goers havevented their spleen at Congress. One angry TV commentator suggestedthat, as a punishment, the 73 Republican freshmen in the House ofRepresentatives be permanently barred from looking at Vermeer'smasterpieces (though the impact of such contemplation might well besalutary).A more severe critic could go further by noting that few of theaffected are natural allies of the hard right. Art appeals to the eliteand is often decadent; passports are for foreign travel and thussomehow un-American; social security is for the weak; national parksmight be more profitable if opened up for oil drilling and commercialexploitation; and Washington itself, a veritable modern Sodom andGomorrah, would be better off turned into a pillar of salt.The last word should lie, surely, with the bureaucrats. While they areon unpaid furlough, members of Congress are receiving their salarycheques and, as is their wont during recess, travelling the globe. So agroup of US diplomats in Latin America ordered back to work to arrangeone such six-nation trip, sent this distinctly undiplomatic message tothe state department:'Frankly, we are disturbed by the thought that while American schoolchildren are being turned away from Smithsonian museums, nationalparks, monuments and memorials, some members of the US Congress arelooking forward to seeing exotic attractions like Copacabana, Iguazu,Cuzco, Macchu Picchu and Otavalo - largely at the expense of theparents of those school children.'Perhaps they should push the congressional delegation off a cliff, inthe manner of the Incas.[London Page 8]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996THIS WEEK:FT GUIDE TO THE MILLENNIUM COMMISSION?   By ANTONY THORNCROFTWhat, exactly, is this Millennium Commission we keep hearing about? Thebody set up to plan the UK's celebration of the year 2000. Most othercountries hope to let off a few fireworks but the UK is taking it veryseriously indeed, and spending about Pounds 1.5bn.Whose idea was it? Lord Palumbo, former chairman of the Arts Council,thought the millennium a good excuse to spruce up Britain's nationalheritage - Stonehenge, the cathedrals, that sort of thing, and perhapsadd one or two modern landmarks. Prime minister John Major agreed, andPalumbo's idea has gathered great momentum.Organised by a quango of the great and the good, presumably? Spot on.Seven worthies, mixed to reflect the aristocracy, business, heritagelobby, science and women, plus a couple of politicians (VirginiaBottomley and Michael Heseltine) who are charged to give to it avote-gathering twist.Where on earth is the money coming from? From the UK national lottery,now a little over a year old. Projects to mark the millennium are oneof the five worthy causes that are getting great chunks of lotterycash, along with the arts, sport, the heritage industry and charities.To date the Millennium Commission has received almost Pounds 300m. Butunlike the other good causes, its good fortune ends on December 311999. After that, its share of the lottery cake will be divided amongthe other four.Hasn't the commission upset the Welsh? Yes, some of them. It wasdecided to spend about Pounds 600m on 12 landmark projects, the 20thcentury's gift to the future. These are to be spread conscientiouslyaround the UK. Wales was owed one, but the national rugby ground atCardiff Arms Park, and a proposed opera house for Cardiff Bay, eachapplied for Pounds 50m. Forced to choose between the two Welshpassions, rugby and music, the commission said 'No' to music and'Maybe' to rugby. The money will probably be spent refurbishing CardiffArms Park.So all this millennial cash is not spreading universal happiness? Noway. There are as many people whingeing as celebrating, especially inthe media. The commission is accused of being short on big ideas andlong on cautious pragmatism. It has imposed severe restrictions bydemanding that applicants should be able to provide half the cost ofany project, although some of this can be in land or labour. This makesthings hard for imaginative loonies.But some good must be coming from it? Well, the Tate Gallery is happy.It has Pounds 50m for its proposed gallery of modern art on Bankside;Kew Gardens has Pounds 21m for a millennium seed bank for plants; andPortsmouth Harbour picked up Pounds 40m to convert itself into theworld's classiest marina. Scotland has been sweetened with Pounds 46mfor a 'new' Hampden Park. These are among the landmark schemes.But I live in Twistelton-on-the-Marsh. I'll never get along to thesenational monuments. The commissioners have also set aside anotherPounds 600m to engender turn-of-the-millennium optimism at the grassroots. Over 300 groups of local activists have already received a goahead for good ideas. For example, there will be a new village hall forIngleton in Derbyshire, thanks to a millennium grant of Pounds 150,000;a coastal railway linking the Giant's Causeway and Bushmills inNorthern Ireland will please locals and tourists, at a cost of Pounds700,000; and Pounds 588,000 has been set aside for salmon ladders inthe River Thames.Strengthening communities and greening the land are buzzwords thecommissioners have taken to heart. The Pounds 42.5m for Sustrans, whichaims to cover the nation with 2,500 miles of cycle paths, just aboutsums it all up.What is going to happen in 2000? Good question. No one knows, althoughImagination, a group of creative whizzkids from London, and M2000,financed by Touche Ross and MAI among others, should have a good idea.They are the two consortia short-listed to organise the year-longcelebration, likely to be a cross between the Festival of Britain andDisney World. The winner will be chosen this month. Four sites havealso been short-listed: Greenwich, near London; the National ExhibitionCentre near Birmingham; Derby; and Stratford, in London.Greenwich, the chosen venue of M2000, is favourite, while Imaginationhas plumped for Birmingham.It depends whether the commissioners go for a site in London plumb onthe international dateline, or Birmingham, near the centre of the UK.With Pounds 100m of millennium money to oil the profit-making event, itshould be some celebration.And on December 31 2000, is it all over? The commissioners hope not.There will be the landmark buildings to enjoy, although there is noequivalent to the Crystal Palace or the Eiffel Tower on the horizon toamaze citizens of 2096. There will also be hundreds of village halls,urban parks and small woodlands.And there will be some bursaries, which are planned to continue adinfinitum. What are they. Can I have one? No reason why not. Thecommission is setting up a Pounds 100m endowment, which should produceabout Pounds 5m a year to be distributed in dollops of Pounds 2,000 andupwards to citizens who want to improve themselves, and then pass onthe improvement to their communities.More details will be announced this month, but you will probably haveto apply to a charity or a voluntary organisation for vetting.

It stomps into view overturningChristmas trees and growling 'No more Mr Nice Guy'. 1996's firstaudiences are invited to choose between Seven (serial killer withhorrific murder methods), The Kingdom (ghoulies in a haunted hospital)and Four Rooms, which climaxes with Quentin Tarantino presiding overchopping a finger.Nevertheless, there are compensations to be found. The faint heartedcan take refuge in France's The Horseman On The Roof - more buckle andswash from director Jean-Paul Cyrano De Bergerac Rappeneau - and inSomething To Talk About, a marital comedy-drama with Julia Roberts. Shetwangs a pretty southern accent while Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlandsprovide power casting as Mom and Pop.In truth, even the nasties are not that nasty. The Kingdom, a weirdlyhilarious TV mini-series turned four-hour movie from Danish directorLars Von Trier, is more black comedy than spine chiller. And there ishumanity between the stomach-testing moments in Seven. Brad Pitt andMorgan Freeman play detectives sleuthing through a series of murderspatterned after the seven deadly sins.The moral is, if you want quality cinema you must take the rough withthe smooth. But you need not take Four Rooms at all. This quartet ofstories proves there are days when even wonder children like Tarantinoshould be locked in the nursery until they get the script right.On video, meanwhile, two films allow you to be adult and childlike atthe same time. Ed Wood is Tim Burton's funny-elegiac homage to theworld's greatest 'bad' director, with Martin Landau eating the sceneryas the horror actor Bela Lugosi.And Dianne Wiest similarly eats the scenery in Woody Allen's splendidshowbiz comedy Bullets Over Broadway. The two actors won last year'sbest-supporting Oscars.[London Page 8]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996PEOPLE: JOHN BROWNE, BP'S MASTER OF RECOVERY - A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TODEBT DOES NOT RULE OUT A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH   By ROBERT CORZINEJohn Browne, British Petroleum's chief executive, has marked thecompletion of his first six months in office with the conclusion of aDollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) natural gas deal in Algeria.The project, which analysts say will help turn BP into a significantinternational gas company, attracted headlines mainly because of itslocation in a country struggling with an Islamist insurgency. But thedeal is also noteworthy in that it will form one of the foundations fora new phase of growth and capital investment at BP, whose lastexpansive foray triggered a debt crisis in 1992 and the departure ofRobert Horton, former chairman and chief executive.That episode still influences the thinking of John Browne and that ofSir David Simon, BP's chairman and the man who engineered the recoveryof the company's fortunes. 'We must not leverage this company everagain,' said one senior executive last week.But the company says a cautious approach to debt does not mean that BPis afraid to act decisively to ensure future growth. It has embarked onbig oil and gas projects in politically unsettled parts of the worldsuch as Colombia, Azerbaijan and Algeria.Such projects are a marked departure from BP's traditional core areas- Alaska and the UK sector of the North Sea. But during Browne's tenureas head of the company's upstream arm, the board came to accept thatpolitical risk is best spread across a range of projects in differentcountries. 'The real risk is having too much in one basket,' says oneBP executive, 'not in going to risky countries which could have amaterial effect to the company's bottom line.'Browne also placed emphasis on the 'phased development' of suchprojects. That allows the company to limit its financial exposureduring the early stages of a project, when there is likely to begreater uncertainty about whether it will prove technically,politically or commercially viable.Industry observers say Browne's greatest success was in re-shaping thestrategic direction of the exploration arm and ensuring that it had astring of possible projects to choose from. It now has sufficientassets to ensure that reserves can be replaced for another 10 years.That means that while many other oil companies hunt for new reserves,BP can focus on projects that are likely to offer the highest return.Yet analysts wonder whether Browne will have equal success tackling theproblems in BP's downstream division, the one part of the company ofwhich he has no direct experience and a sector in which big changes mayhave an impact on BP's customer base.He has recently devoted time to downstream issues, in particular to thefuture of the company's refineries. They, like much of the industry,suffer from thin margins and offer little scope for any technologicaladvantage over competitors. An announcement on the furtherrestructuring of the company's refining assets is expected this month.Browne, an engineer who believes technology can continuously enhanceBP's financial performance, is upbeat about chemicals - a segment inwhich proprietary technology can increase competitiveness and thedivision that BP has chosen to lead its expansion in Asia.An announcement on broader corporate aims is expected in March. Therehave been rumours in the industry that Browne has contemplated radicalchanges to the way BP conducts its business, with some observersspeculating that Browne, a former corporate treasurer, would like toadopt more of a 'merchant bank' approach to the industry.BP executives say he is more likely to maintain a step-by-stepapproach, and emulate Simon by setting simple targets related to BP'sfinancial and performance ambitions.One of his biggest challenges will be to maintain BP's strong financialperformance. 'You can grow from an uncompetitive base by cuttingcosts,' says one executive. 'The hard task is to grow from acompetitive base, and not just capture the chemicals cycle at its top.'That means BP will have to focus on efforts to keep margins as high aspossible even in a downturn.Browne's strategic aim is to create a 'distinctive' company - one withelements that competitors would have difficulty copying and one whichwould provide unusual financial returns to investors. He emphasises theimportance of relationships with host governments, partners andsuppliers.Browne also wants a 'unique' set of assets, including markets. But bigacquisitions of the type that landed BP in so much trouble in the pastappear to have been ruled out for now, although executives say BP willcontinue to make small-scale acquisitions.Browne's first six months have been made easier by BP's strongfinancial performance. But in future there is likely to be greaterinvestor interest in how he and his colleagues deal with the narrowerissues of the downstream assets and with capital investment decisions.Senior BP executives say investors are right to demand the highestcapital efficiency possible. After all, says one, 'the industry as awhole has a pretty bad track record. It hasn't spent money wisely.'What of BP specifically? 'We should expect to withstand toughscrutiny,' he says. 'But I don't believe BP will repeat the past.'[London Page 8]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MANAGEMENT:BIG IDEAS, BIG BOOKS - SEVEN WISE MEN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS ON THECHALLENGES COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO FACE IN 1996What will be the big management challenge of 1996? And what was thebest/most enjoyable/most instructive business book you read in 1995?On this page we print seven answers to these questions.Sumantra Ghoshal, professor of strategic management at London BusinessSchool:Challenge: Over the past few years many companies have focused onrationalisation and restructuring. Often this has requiredfragmentation of their organisations into small units and some radicaldecentralisation. Now, with much of the fat out of the system, thechallenge will be to reintegrate their fragmented organisations topursue new growth opportunities.Book: The Boundaryless Organisation by Ron Ashkenas, Dave Ulrich, ToddJick and Steve Kerr (Jossey-Bass, San Francisco).This is a wonderfully practical and down-to-earth book that is bothidea-rich and implementation-focused. It provides insightful ideas,clear examples and simple tools - a rare combination in the world ofbusiness publications.Gerry Robinson, chief executive, Granada Group:Challenge: Not to run out of steam. The 1980s was a period of hugegrowth and expansion through new markets, new technology and a globalview of business. The 1990s have been dominated by cost control, costcutting, streamlining and tighter management control in order tomaintain profitable growth. This must not become the main role ofmanagement - we must also use creativity, enthusiasm, leadership andsound strategic direction to improve a company's health and growth.Book: I have to confess that I did not read any business books at alllast year. This is not because I feel I have nothing to learn aboutbusiness but because I did not find the time.The most important book I read last year was unquestionably Wild Swansby Jung Chang (HarperCollins). Reading about China's culturalrevolution is more enlightening and satisfying than reading about thecorporate revolution.I am a strong believer in broadening the mind in spheres other thanbusiness.Tim Simpson, managing director, Arthur D Little:Challenge: 'Seventy per cent of all re-engineering projects fail',people will tell you, misquoting one of the big change gurus. My viewis not so pessimistic. Many companies have made large-scale change workfor them, and their performance has jumped as a result.But with the recovery faltering, and markets ever opening to worldcompetition, sustaining this performance improvement will be themanagement challenge of 1996.Book: 1995 was again notable more for books I wanted to read than thoseI found time for. But one which did hit home was the Fifth DisciplineFieldbook, by Senge and friends (Nicholas Brealey Publishing). Ease ofreading is one attraction - it's written for browsing and providesusable suggestions on almost every page.And its central proposition - that learning, and particularly teamlearning, is a key part of building competence in companies - isintuitively obvious. The book goes further, suggesting practical waysto manage the learning process and build competence faster. And itcomplements Senge's earlier, more theoretical work, with much morepractical experience.Peter Sutherland, chairman and managing director, Goldman SachsInternational:Challenge: To cope with the effects of globalisation. Within a veryshort time the world has decisively changed and management willincreasingly be required to focus on opportunities in, and challengesfrom, the emerging markets that will provide much of the economicdynamism for the world into the next millennium. An understanding ofrelatively familiar cultures and relationships will have to beaugmented by an under-standing of relatively different environments.Book: I am not proud to admit that I have virtually never read businessbooks (unless written by Sir John Harvey-Jones). In 1995, however, Ihave read some that I would recommend.The first of these is Corporate Level Strategy by Goold, Campbell andAlexander (Wiley), which looks at managing multi-business companiessuch as GE, ABB and Canon.My second and third books are not business books per se but I recommendthem because, in today's world, a good manager has to be tuned in todramatic political change in terms of national sovereignty. AndrewMarr's Ruling Britannia (Michael Joseph) is about more than Britain.It is about a world in transition. One doesn't have to agree with allhis conclusions to find his opinions both provocative and relevant.I would also include Where Did We Go Wrong - From the Gold Standard toEurope (Faber & Faber) by the remarkable Eric Roll, who analyses pasterrors in policy relating to the British economy and, above all, toBritish negativism towards European integration.Adair Turner, director-general, Confederation of British Industry:Challenge: Growing. British businesses have got very very good over thepast 10-15 years at being lean and mean, at increasing productivity.They need now to get better at investing for the long term, atmarketing, at creating new products. A stable economic climate shouldmake this possible.Book: Not business but economics, and not one but two. The State We'reIn by Will Hutton (Cape). Disagreed with lots of it and almost gave upafter the first two pages of polemic, but provocative and insightful ifyou persevere. And The World in 2020 by Hamish McRae (HarperCollins),crystal-ball gazing with insight.David Wellings, chief executive, Cadbury Schweppes:Challenge: The same as always. Putting forward the best face possibleon the past in order to attract investors; scanning the latest mountainfor that elusive and obstacle-strewn path to shareholder value; andensuring that managers of vision, tenacity and stamina are there tostep in when you eventually fall off the mountain.Book: Neville Bain's Successful Management (Macmillan Business). Sound,practical advice from a businessman to businessmen. Blessed relief fromconsultants peddling the latest irrelevant buzzword for keeping inshape 'corporate re-engineering' or motivation 'empowerment'.George Yip, adjunct professor of strategy at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA):Challenge: Multinational companies will continue to face in 1996 thechallenge of globalisation and of building global capability.A successful global company today needs the capability to access and totransfer anywhere in the world technology, ideas, factors ofproduction, and other sources of competitive advantage.In this regard the biggest challenge will be moving executives aroundthe world in the face of escalating costs.Book: Strategic Alliances: An Entrepreneurial Approach to Globalizationby Michael Y. Yoshino and U. Srinivasa Rangan (Harvard Business SchoolPress).Strategic alliances are a major method for globalisation and this isthe best book I have read to date on the international aspects of thissubject.[London Page 9]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MANAGEMENT:A PRODUCT OF POETRY - RUPERT MORRIS WONDERS HOW FAMOUS VERSE COULD BEUSED IN ADVERTISING   By RUPERT MORRISReaders of the Management Page may have noticed that Union Bank ofSwitzerland has been using poetry in its advertisements.'Thoughts that transcend time from Union Bank of Switzerland' haveappeared on global satellite and cable channels, featuring Sir JohnGielgud and others reading classic poems like Ozymandias, Ulysses andso on.The poetry was chosen, according to project manager VincentoTravaglione, to embody corporate values of 'responsibility, openness,courage and perseverance'.Of course, there is nothing new about poetry in advertising. In theearly years of this century, we were regaled with gems like these: TheOnoto, the Owl and the Waverley pen, They come as a boon and a blessingto men . .Or the following, proclaiming the attraction of Everybody's, a popularmagazine of the inter-war years: Oh Mr Porter, whatever shall I do? Iwas reading my Everybody's and got carried on to Crewe] Copy-writingwas in its infancy in those days, I suppose, which may explain whythese excruciating verses lasted for several years; and yet they wereprobably extremely effective, imprinting themselves on the popularconsciousness in much the same way as the catchiest pop songs.Nowadays, alas, advertisers are more image-conscious. You can't imaginethe Body Shop using some naff rhyme, can you? Ovaltine is thehonourable exception, resurrecting the delightful song of those 'happygirls and boys', the 'Ovalteenies'.But Advico Young and Rubicam, the Zurich agency which dreamed up theUBS campaign, have been doubly smart. Not only have they regaled TVviewers with some decent poems for a change, subtly enhancing theirclient's image; they have also done it on the cheap by using authorswho are long out of copyright.There is no end to the number of commercial interests that mightbenefit from a quick glance through the Oxford Book of English Verse.Brewers, for instance, need look no further than AE Housman. Indeed,Ind Coope should surely consider funding an AE Housman chair of poetryat its Burton-on-Trent headquarters.No modern copy-writer could improve on this passage from A ShropshireLad: Say, for what hop-yards meant, Or why was Burton built on Trent?Oh many a peer of England brews Livelier liquor than the Muse. And maltdoes more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. Ale, man, ale'sthe stuff to drink For fellows whom it hurts to think.Your AB audience might blench somewhat at the last line, butself-conscious intellectuals are not usually beer drinkers anyway, so Idon't think we need worry.Haircare has been a fruitful medium for advertisers, and yet one doesfeel that there is a certain creative vacuum in this field.Purveyors of hair bleach must despair of that stubborn group ofindependent-minded modern women who refuse to emulate the models withflowing locks on their screens and become bottle blondes. Perhaps theyshould try a touch of Wordsworth: Earth hath not anything to show morefair  .And if that doesn't work, there's always Eliot: Stand on the highestpavement of the stair - Lean on a garden urn Weave, weave the sunlightin your hair On reflection, this verse might be more appropriate forwigmakers. But that's the joy of poetry as an advertising medium. It'sso flexible.Other products and services might not be so easy. It is certainly timethe army came up with something better than that macho stuff with younglads driving tanks, swimming, skiing and and generally behaving likewould-be contestants on Gladiators. How about something that brings outthose unchanging values of selfless patriotism? The Soldier, by RupertBrooke, has the right combination of gravitas and romanticism. But thatfirst line is a bit of a downer: 'If I should die . .' You might aswell make it a commercial for funeral services.Now there's a thought. Undertakers have been loath to advertise up tonow, but poetry might give them just the opportunity they need. Thewords of the American Stephen Vincent Benet spring to mind: You maybury my body in Sussex grass, You may bury my tongue in Champmedy, Ishall not be there, I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at WoundedKnee.At Berry & Birnam we always respect the wishes of the departed. Organrefrigeration a speciality. Or something like that.[London Page 9]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MANAGEMENT:LIQUID THERAPY FOR THE NEW YEAR   By LUCY KELLAWAYIhave not been myself recently. Not since I filled my body with astrange orange liquid at the start of the festive season. The incidentwas quite out of character and the memory of it leaves me feelingsheepish and puzzled even now. Lest you conclude that I went wild onthe mandarin liqueur, I should assure you that my liquid was imaginaryand that it has made me calmer, unflappable, ready for the new year.The bizarre story began when a lady named Deborah Marshall-Warrenoffered me a free trial of something called Orange Liquid Therapy. Shesaid this was a 'mental de-tox' session that involved hypnotism, deeprelaxation and direct suggestion to sooth all my stresses away. Halfwayround the bend with pre-Christmas strain at the time, I felt willing totry anything. When she told me her practice was in Regent Street, thatclinched it: I could sort myself out and do some Christmas shopping aswell.Yet when I arrived at her office, I started to feel uneasy. There wasan unnatural calm about Ms Marshall-Warren. Her eyes were red and shelooked as if she had been crying for weeks. We sat in a tiny cubicle ashot as the Sahara and lit by a large bright globe. 'I'm going to putyou under quickly', she said. Obediently, I sat in the chair and triedto relax. I looked at the spot on her hand. I closed my eyes. 'Feelyour calves filling with a warm, orange liquid', she crooned. 'It issoothing, tingling, and it is moving, up, up into your knees. Feel yourknees filling with a warm, orange liquid. It is soothing, tingling. Itis moving, up, up into your thighs . .' You get the picture.When I was full to the brim with orange liquid, I had to imagine itscrubbing out my cares, fears, anxieties, fizzing and dissolving themin much the same way that Domestos gets to work with stubborn householdstains. Then, when there was no more work for it to do, I was told topicture it slowly draining out through my fingers and toes. Clean andemptied, I was informed that I was feeling lighter, more confident,better able to cope and happier.Set down in black and white, orange liquid therapy sounds daft as abrush. I am constitutionally opposed to New Age nonsense. I do notbelieve in trendy miracle cures for complex problems. The sort ofstress relief that makes sense to me is to work less, drink less or togo on holiday.So imagine my bewilderment to find myself feeling much better after 45minutes of semi-conscious sloshing around in make-believe colouredfluid. Before entering the cubicle I felt tense, on the verge ofhysteria. Afterwards I was cheerful, unbothered even by Oxford Circusin the rain at rush hour, and more or less equal to Christmas.Yet when I tell my friends and colleagues my wonderful hypnotism storythey give me a wary look. As far as they are concerned, I've started ona slippery slope, and soon I will be pushing all kinds of dubiousmanagement gimmicks. I insist I am still the same person. They are notso sure. We shall see.1995 was the year in which the re-engineering craze died. Areplacement, developed by McKinsey and explained in the consultant'slatest quarterly bulletin is called: Do It, Then Fix It. I like thisnew fad more than the old one, because it comes in words of onesyllable. The idea behind it is equally hard to argue with: companiesshould work out what changes to their business need to be made, thenthey should carry them out without more ado. Once done, they shouldassess the result, and if it has flaws, they should swiftly put themright. Indeed, this seems to be such a sensible way of going aboutthings, it is a mystery to me why companies need McKinsey to spell itout to them.In the middle of all the change that companies are supposed to beundergoing, one thing remains constant: workers feel their bosses donot have their best interests at heart.Never mind all the empowerment, teamwork and egalitarian structures,employees take the same dim view of their managers as they always havedone. According to actuaries Watson Wyatt, less than half believe theircompany is well managed, or think that their bosses make the rightstrategic decisions.The only thing that has changed in recent years is that workers nowview their superiors as hypocrites: good at drawing up a set of valuesfor the company, less good at living by those values themselves.I realise it is not for me to volunteer new year's resolutions forothers, especially as I have not made any for myself. But might it notbe time for senior managers to start practising what they preach? Iused to think that human behaviour was difficult to change, inparticular that old dogs could not be taught new tricks. But now I amnot so sure. Dare I recommend a little hypnotherapy? On second thoughtsit would only work if they wanted to change. And that, surely, is theproblem.[London Page 9]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MANAGEMENT: TEGE - FAST TRACK   By IAN RODGERWhy not start the new year by acquiring a share in Tege, the Swisscompany that is developing a french-fries vending machine?That's right, insert a Pounds 1 coin, wait about a minute and out popsa fresh, hot portion of french fries. Well, almost. The vending machineis still in the prototype stage and unlikely to be on the streets ofEurope until next spring.Nevertheless Tege's shares soared to a high of nearly SFr74 (Pounds41.50) on the Geneva Stock Exchange last May, valuing the company at animpressive SFr68m. They slid recently to SFr48 after it became apparentthat the planned launch would be delayed by about six months.The machine - or rather the french fries production system - is thebrainchild of Richard Sorensen, an American inventor. Sorensen joinedsix European investors, including Jacques Hennessy (of the Cognachouse) after an initial association with a US venture-capital companyturned sour.They claim to have put about Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.8m) into the ventureto date. Early last year they reversed into a derelict quoted Swissfunicular company, Tege, and transferred all the patents to it.Together they hold 55 per cent of Tege's 920,000 bearer shares.Patrick Bigger, a Swiss who is chief executive, said they chose a Swissincorporation because many of the institutional investors in theproject are Swiss and wanted a Swiss franc share. Operations, however,are based in England, where a three-month market test with 25 machinesis scheduled to start next March.The problem with producing french fries is that the fries quicklybecome soggy. Thus a vending machine can only work if it makes a freshportion every time. Sorensen's solution is to use potato powder.Once an order is made, a given amount of powder is measured and mixedwith water to achieve a dough-like substance. The dough cube is pressedthrough an extruder into french fries which fall into four steelbaskets in a pot of hot oil. The baskets revolve slowly around the oilpot and a minute later tip the fries into a chute where they fall intoa cardboard sleeve.The clever bit, claims Bigger, is the composition of the powder, whichcontains patented additives that make it form into a perfectlyconsistent dough within five seconds. Any dough left lying aboutquickly reverts to harmless dry powder.The oil is kept at 220'C, well below its boiling point, and isfrequently stirred even if no orders are being taken. It is alsoautomatically filtered and topped up for losses that go with the fries.Tege executives are now setting up licensing and marketing arrangementsin many countries and spinning out creative sales and profit forecasts.In one projection, 1999 net income comes in at SFr92.9m.They plan both to sell and lease machines and supply the magic powder.A machine will sell for about SFr15,000 and revenue and earningsprojections are based on portions being sold for Pounds 1, DM1.50(Pounds 0.67), FFr4.50 (Pounds 0.58), or SFr1.80. They assume theaverage machine will sell 50 portions a week.The company needs another Dollars 6m or so to cover its costs untilrevenues start flowing in. A convertible bond issue is the most likelyroute, says Bigger.[London Page 9]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996BUSINESS TRAVEL:HOTELIER'S STARCK CHOICE - IAN SCHRAGER'S HOTELS ARE FOR THOSE WHO CANAFFORD CHINTZ BUT WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT   By ALICE RAWSTHORNOn paper, Ian Schrager looks like the sort of self-indulgentbusinessman who is rather too self-indulgent for his own good.He did, after all, fly 80 palm trees from Washington to the Delanohotel he opened in Miami last summer, because they were more attractivethan the local crop. And, after taking a closer look at the sand onnearby Miami Beach, he shipped in a ton-and-a-half of a superiorvariety.Yet Schrager is not just another architecture junkie who allowsaesthetic excess to cloud his business judgment. He can rattle off theprofit margins on almost every aspect of the Delano and of his threeNew York hotels. He has harnessed his love of design to turn them intothe hotels of choice for what he calls 'the generation that wantssomething different' - artists, actors, designers and musicians who canafford four-star or five-star establishments but find them ratherboring.The three New York hotels - the Royalton, Morgans and the Paramount -are almost always fully booked. The Delano in Miami is so popular thatlast month's American Vogue prefaced an article on other Miami hotelsby saying: 'If you can't get into the Delano . . . .'. Schrager is nowrenovating the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles and searching for a sitein London.The progress of his business career has been erratic, to say the least.He made his name in the late 1970s with Studio 54, a New York nightclubthat he ran with his university roommate, the late Steve Rubell. Studio54 captured the hedonistic spirit of the late 1970s. But in 1980Schrager and Rubell were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for taxevasion.After their release they opened a nightclub, the Palladium, anddiversified into hotels. Neither had any experience of the business,but they knew what sort of place to open. 'There was no point inopening another luxury hotel,' says Schrager. 'That end of the businesswas well served by Claridges in London, the Bel Air in LA and theCarlyle in New York. They serve room service course by course atClaridges. You can't beat that.'They sensed a need for a new type of luxury hotel for the sort ofpeople who used to go to Studio 54 - people who wanted, and werewilling to pay for, the comfort and service they got in conventionalluxury hotels, but would prefer a less formal setting more in tune withtheir taste than the chintzy interior of Claridges.They started by renovating Morgans, a discreet mid-town hotel with 154rooms built in the late 1920s. Schrager commissioned Andree Putman, theFrench designer, to refurbish Morgans in her understatedly elegantmodernist style, but they were more adventurous in their choice ofdesigner for the next hotel, the Royalton, which they entrusted to theflamboyant Frenchman, Philippe Starck. Schrager worked with Starckagain on the Paramount, an equally extrovert but less expensive hotelthat opened in 1990.Each of the New York hotels has its own character. The Royalton is themost audacious. The Paramount is for people who love the Royalton butcannot quite afford it. And Morgans is the most discreet. Schragerensures there is a difference of at least Dollars 50 (Pounds 32)between the room rates: Dollars 250 for the Royalton, Dollars 200 forMorgans and Dollars 100 for the Paramount. They all have an averageoccupancy rate of more than 90 per cent, against the US industryaverage of 71 per cent.'Coming from the nightclub business was great training for running anhotel,' says Schrager. 'You're selling a commodity product. A nightclubsells the same drink and plays the same music as the competition. Theonly thing that differentiates them is production values. It's the samewith hotels.'Production values are Schrager's forte. Starck, with whom hecollaborated on the Delano's all-white interior and Alice In Wonderlandgarden, is prodigiously talented but notoriously difficult to workwith. Schrager's solution is to set up a project management team ofarchitects, art directors and buyers to implement Starck's ideas andbring them in on budget.'After doing three hotels with Philippe, we know what to expect,' saysSchrager. 'We don't panic when we get these weird faxes from him.' Thissystem has produced some of Starck's best work. He is one of theworld's most sought-after designers who receives three or four requestsa month to design hotels, but says 'no to all of them, except Ian'.All Schrager's hotels look expensive. The fittings are speciallycommissioned and the renovation budgets seem high - Dollars 28m for theDelano, Dollars 35m for the Royalton, Dollars 60m for the 610-roomParamount. But Schrager is careful to buy existing hotels which will beeasy to convert. 'We replace everything, even the plumbing, but leavethe rooms intact. You can get into trouble by banging on walls.' Hesays it would cost 'much more' to kit out his hotels in conventionalchintz than in a sumptuous Starck design.His latest project is the Mondrian in Los Angeles. It was purpose-builtas a 1960s apartment hotel and is now being redesigned by Starck, whosays he wants it to be 'very, very white with one or two symbols ofcolour' to emphasise the 'dreaminess of LA'. Schrager has asked artistJames Turrell to create a 'three-dimensional living art piece' for thefoyer 'so it will be like walking into an artwork.'As his hotel chain expands, Schrager has cut costs by pooling areassuch as purchasing and marketing. He is careful to concentrate on roomrental, and licenses out services such as bars, restaurants and gyms.Brian McNally, who has turned the Royalton's '44' into one ofManhattan's most chic restaurants, runs the Delano's Blue Room with popstar Madonna as a co-investor. Schrager even licenses the newsstands.'When we ran the newsstand at the Paramount, it lost Dollars 1,000 amonth. We've given it to a guy who knows the business and it makesDollars 4,500 a month.'The Mondrian is scheduled for completion in October and Schrager willthen expand outside the US. He has hunted for sites in London withoutsuccess, although Granada's hostile Pounds 3.3bn bid for Forte couldcreate some opportunities.'My customers travel on a certain axis,' says Schrager. 'New York,Miami and Los Angeles are on it, so are London and Paris. You couldn'topen hotels like mine just anywhere because there wouldn't be enoughpeople to fill it. And I'd put as much effort into a place with 17rooms as I would into one with 700.'[London Page 10]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996BUSINESS TRAVEL:BANGKOK GETS TOUGH ON MOTORISTSMore than 100 people were arrested on the first day of a campaign byBangkok police to force motorists to heed traffic regulations as partof an attempt to unsnarl the city's gridlock.In Bangkok, known for the world's worst traffic jams, drivers routinelyflout the rules. Violators often slip the police small bribes and areswiftly on their way.Car sales in 1995 are expected to have topped 500,000, making Thailandthe largest car market in south-east Asia. But only 8 per cent ofBangkok's land surface is covered by roads, compared to 25 per cent inNew York and Paris. Short trips in the city can take hours.Bangkok's traffic problem is affecting the city's development. Someforeign businesses have decided to locate elsewhere, and tourists spendless time and money in the capital, citing their aversion to thetraffic. The campaign is part of a plan by Thaksin Shinawatra, abillionaire businessman and deputy prime minister, who was elected lastJuly on a pledge that he would solve Bangkok's traffic problems in sixmonths or resign. Thaksin's deadline - January 26 - is approaching withno noticeable improvement in traffic conditions.However, the World Bank recently announced it will provide a Dollars150m (Pounds 97m) loan to Thailand to help alleviate its trafficproblems. Maurice Le-Blanc of the bank said: 'The government ofThailand has taken a leading role in the region in addressingenvironmental and road safety issues in an aggressive manner, which todate have proved very successful. This will further those efforts.'For those who can make it through the traffic, Bangkok's firstCyberpub has just opened, providing a focus for the party-lovingafter-work crowd. For Dollars 12 an hour, customers can sit at one of10 glass-topped tables equipped with a Compaq Presario.Getting into the spirit of things, an opening night trio of womenclicked on to a virtual dating service which bills itself as 'Your linkto true love'. As the picture and vital statistics of a young hunk fromNew York appeared on the screen, one adjusted her glasses and took acloser look.The Cyberpub is in the same ownership as the local upmarket Dusit Thanihotel chain.[London Page 10]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996BUSINESS TRAVEL: CARRIERS CUT FARESBritish Airways is cutting fares to almost 100 destinations untilJanuary 17 as part of of its World Offers.

The move came a day after a flurryof winter fare cuts of up to 50 per cent initiated by Delta Air Lines,which was swiftly matched by most of its competitors.Italian air traffic controllers have signed a new wage agreement,ending their long fight for more money, a union official said. Theaccord will give controllers a 6 per cent salary rise for the period1994-95.

My answer is neither Microsoft nor Netscape. It isa tiny new company in Philadelphia called Pobox. com - spelt as if itwere an abbreviation of Post Office Box, but pronounced as the singleword 'Pobox'. Its product consists of a simple forwarding service thatis an electronic equivalent of a post office box.The system works as follows. Customers give out an e-mail addressending in pobox. com - like the one that appears at the bottom of thiscolumn. When their friends or colleagues send them e-mail at thataddress, a computer in Philadelphia looks up the recipient in a database and forwards the message immediately to their Internet provider.This service allows people to give out an e-mail address that isindependent of where they work or where they choose to buy Internetaccess. Moving from one Internet provider to another is simply a matterof sending a message to pobox. com giving a new forwarding address andquoting a 'magic cookie', a number that establishes the customer'sauthenticity.I have already discovered an advantage of the service. Having recentlymoved from London to Silicon Valley in order to work on a book, I haveswitched Internet providers. But my address has remained the same, andmessages sent to me as if I were in London are forwarded to me inCalifornia without my having had to tell anyone how to reach me.Yet people moving house are not the sole market. Other potential usersincludes customers of CompuServe, which allows people to use only anindecipherable string of numbers as their e-mail address.Equally attracted will be those who are embarrassed by the cumbersomelength or strange letter-and-number combination of their real e-mailaddress.The entrepreneurs behind Pobox. com are a pair of students at theUniversity of Pennsylvania, still living in a college dormitory: ReuvenBell, 23, whose subject is religious studies, and Meng-Weng Wong, 21, acomputer science major born in Singapore. The two launched theirservice in early 1995, and already have 3,000 users. In keeping withthe principle that most of the best Internet businesses start off bygiving things away, the pair offer a generous free trial lasting threemonths.Thereafter, the price for forwarding mail starts from Dollars 15 ayear, payable by credit card - with the incentive of six years for theprice of five to those who choose to pay Dollars 55 in advance.Three months is exactly right for the trial period. It is long enoughfor customers to become comfortable with the service and to give theirnew e-mail address to all their friends, but not long enough for anyoneto find it worthwhile to start again with a new name from scratch.So far, 850 electronic invoices have been sent out, and almost halfhave been paid. Because of a glitch in the billing software, Bell andWong have not yet had time to send out reminders. But early indicationsare promising, and the pair claim that an automated trawl of Internetnewsgroups has turned up more than 1,000 mentions of their service,only one of which was negative.Whether Pobox. com will make serious money or not is too early topredict. Its founders certainly hope so. Bell has just taken time offfrom his degree to work on the business 12 hours a day, and is planningto pursue some Wharton MBA courses on his return to academia. Moreover,the company already has imitators: a sign, surely, that others see thepotential in its idea.Even a modest success could have a sharp effect on the Net. It wouldremove the fear of changing e-mail address that forces many to staywith an unsatisfactory service provider. In doing so, Pobox. com'ssuccess would make a large global industry significantly morecompetitive.Talking of magic cookies, someone recently sent me the followingstory by e-mail. A woman who had eaten a delicious cookie at the cafeof a department store in Dallas asked for the recipe. 'We don't give itout,' said the waiter. However, the customer persisted and offered topay for the recipe.On hearing that the price would be 'two fifty', she agreed to charge itto her credit card along with the bill for her lunch, and was thenhanded the recipe on a printed sheet. Thirty days later, her Visastatement revealed she had been charged Dollars 250.The furious cookie lover called the company's head office, thinkingthat the real figure should have been Dollars 2.50, but was told therewas no mistake.The Dollars 250 was to insure that not just anyone could afford therecipe. Accordingly, her request for a refund had to be turned down,but the woman got her own back in the end.She copied the recipe into an e-mail, which she posted to all herfriends. They posted it to their friends, and they in turn to theirs.'I paid for it,' her e-mail said, 'so you can have it for free.'I find it hard to imagine that the department store named in the e-mailwould behave in such a pig-headed way.But even if apocryphal, the story illustrates the power of theInternet. By the time you read this, tens of thousands of people mayhave baked cookies according to the recipe without paying Dollars 250.And the name of the store chain will have been blackened on computerscreens all over the world.Tim.

Home shopping, that supposedlytrail-blazing benefit of interactive television, has fallen out of itssupermarket trolley.Less than a year ago the pundits were predicting a couch-potato futurefor us all. Sitting comfortably in front of our screens, we would surfthe stores and trawl the malls. Never again need we venture into therough, tough world of Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. We wouldclick-on, cruise-thru', and our cyber-shopping trollies would be filledby techno-magic.Well, it hasn't happened yet. But is it on its way?The picture is confused as there are two types of televisual homeshopping. First, conventional satellite/cable channels offeringmerchandise in a fairly traditional way. Second, shopping emporia -mostly American - are burgeoning on the Net.The more knowledgeable US home shopping gurus have long been suspiciousof the forecast explosion in their marketplace. QVC, America's largest,highest profile home-shopping channel, mostly sells jewellery (42 percent of its turnover) and clothing (18 per cent). For clothing, thereturn rate is about 40 per cent.A couple of years ago QVC's then retiring chairman, Joseph Segel, saidin a notable speech: 'The number of people tuned to a particularchannel when your advertising runs is likely to be a small fraction ofthe number you could reach with direct mail. The cost of running ashopping channel is much greater than most people realise. Some systemdevelopers and their software programmers assume that consumers areitching to be converted from passive to interactive TV viewers.Certainly there are some people who fit that mould. But I venture tosay that the great American public prefers just to watch television andlet someone else do the work.'In turn, futurologist John Naisbitt's well-informed Trend Letter - apublication understandably keen to embrace almost anything andeverything new under the sun - recently asked: 'Is the much-hyped ageof online shopping about to bloom? Not really.' The same issue of TrendLetter reported that 'merchants on the Internet are reluctant tosolicit credit-card numbers for payment, lest hackers steal accountnumbers' - a little cybernetic difficulty that has by no means beenresolved.Nonetheless, research estimates suggest that 2m online purchases weremade in the US in the last year. That sounds an awful lot until youremember that it equates to a single purchase by less than 1 per centof America's population. And Americans, particularly those living wayout nowhere, have always been catalogue shoppers, so direct marketinghas always been big business in the US.It is a far-flung country, and even with gasolene as cheap as Coke itdoesn't make a lot of sense to drive hundreds of miles for a rubbergrommet. In other words, established home shoppers may just beswitching media, from print to Net - without new shoppers beinginveigled into the couch-potato lifestyle.Where Americans are slow to lead, Europeans are even slower to follow.At the end of 1994 a study of the multimedia marketplace in Europecarried out by leading research group Inteco reported that the demandfor home shopping was non existent. 'No one in the study,' itproclaimed, 'showed any interest in being able to order goodselectronically.'The progress of home shopping in Britain confirms that. QVC startedwith a bang in the UK but sales appear to be stabilising at aboutPounds 50m annually - not a lot with which to run a full-time channeland supply some 300,000 customers.Part of the reason for this disappointing growth is the result, Isuspect, of the hype attached to the phrase 'virtual reality'.Televisual shopping, it is claimed, provides 'virtual reality'. In avirtual reality supermarket you can whiz round the aisles picking up apack of this and a jar of that as you skid past the shelves. It soundsso futuristic, so clever, that we have been seduced into believing itwould be wonderful. But would it?It would certainly be fun once or twice, like a video game. But we allknow what has happened to the sales of video games. The problem is thatvirtual reality really doesn't bear much resemblance to reality.We encounter reality through our five senses: sight, sound, smell,taste and touch. So-called virtual reality offers reality in - at best- two dimensions: sight and sound. Sight is the most important singlesense involved when we go shopping. But it is not the only one.As supermarkets are well aware, smell is all-important. That is whythey put fruit and vegetables at the front of the store, and bake theirown bread. For many products, touch is as important as smell. ('If youdon't want the goods, don't muck 'em about', went the oldcostermongers' injunction, to restrain customers from manhandling theproduce).Paradoxically, it is in the area of sight that virtual reality is leastreal. If Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, believes that projectinghuge cyber-blowups of great masterpieces on to his walls will conveyeven a tad of their artistic merit, it is as well he never tried tomajor in aesthetics.But never mind great paintings. Would you even buy fresh meats or fish,or even fruits and vegetables, without seeing them in the flesh? Ifpeople didn't want to inspect the goods carefully and choose thefreshest, why would they shop at the deli counter? The newest Tescostores now have large old-fashioned butcher's sections. And if you wantto inspect groceries before you buy them, why not shop for the lot atone stop?Apart from groceries, the sector that has generated most chatter amongthe marketing classes - but again, little action so far - is cars. (Themarketing classes are not much interested in jewellery - not in sellingit, anyway).Automotive gurus constantly predict that the end of the showroom isnigh: motorists, it is said, will compare and contrast different modelson-screen before selecting their test-drive short-list. And one day,even the test-drive will be taken on-screen.The assumption is that video information is more appealing to motoriststhan printed or personal (showroom) information. Maybe. But feel,comfort, guidance - even smell - are important reasons for showroomvisits, and cannot be duplicated by 'virtual reality'.Which may explain why the only area in which home shopping seems to betaking off is one in which virtual reality is virtually non-existent -the marketing, not of goods, but of services, particularly financialservices.As financial products are, so to speak, invisible and intangible, theyare ideal for telephone selling. While financial service providersincreasingly use direct response television advertisingcost-effectively, their commercials could hardly be described asvirtual reality. Or indeed, in many cases, as reality of any sort.Not that home shopping is not going to grow. It will, but it will beslow and highly specialised. Delivery takes time and costs money. Manypeople, perhaps most, will never feel comfortable with computers.Forget those middle-class parental boasts of brilliantly sophisticatedcomputer-literate kids; think, instead, about all the underprivileged,computer-illiterate kids.Nor is home shopping quite as revolutionary as cyberbuffs believe.Almost exactly a century ago the Victorians were opening up their ownversion of the information superhighway (and with at least as muchhyperbole). The UK postal service, the railways, the telephone and thetelegram were bustin' out all over. Telegrams were described - as newmedia so frequently are described by their sponsors - as 'the boldestadvertisements in modern times.'By the turn of the century, all the great London department stores hadmail-order departments. Harrods, which pioneered home shopping bytelephone, rejoiced in the telephonic address EVERYTHING, LONDON.Whiteley's in Bayswater boasted they could supply anything 'from a pinto an elephant' door-to-door.And the Army and Navy store sped huge mail-order catalogues to itscustomers in every corner of the globe, carrying within their covers acornucopia of sumptuous and succulent merchandise. Moreover, deliverywas often a good deal faster and cheaper than it generally would betoday.Home shopping may yet be the bonanza of the future. But I wouldn't betmy Tesco shares on it.Winston Fletcher is chairman of the UK advertising agency DelaneyFletcher Bozell.[London Page 11]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MEDIA FUTURES: CYBER SIGHTINGS   By STEPHEN MCGOOKINKicking off this US presidential election year, the Doonesbury TownHall site (www. doonesbury. com/ main. html), based on Garry Trudeau'sconsistently brilliant strip cartoon, looks a fine way of keeping tabson the campaign as it unfolds.

Traditionally, the pro has received a small retainerfrom his club but earned the bulk of his living selling equipment andgiving lessons.Yet selling equipment to club members is becoming virtually impossibleas the tiniest of retailers strives to compete against specialist chainstores such as American Golf Discount and Nevada Bob's.'The members don't realise what a financial strain it is to carry thestock on a big overdraft and they can be such fickle customers,' saysHaydn Darrell, the pro at the small Devon club of Sidmouth. 'I'll seethem turn up to play with a new set of clubs and I won't even have hadthe chance to match the price they've paid from one of the big chainstores.'Darrell's experience is echoed nationally. A recent report from thespecialist Golf Research Group predicted that the 2,400 retail outletssupplying the UK golf equipment market will have shrunk to only 200 to300 shops within a year or two.'The traditional pro shop just cannot survive,' says Colin Hegarty,head of GRG. 'The average gross turnover is around Pounds 110,000 ayear and they cannot stock the shop and survive on that kind ofvolume.'His figures show that the bigger retail outlets are growing fast, witha matching shrinkage at the smaller end. Hegarty says the club pro hastwo options: 'Get out of the business quickly: it's better to take abig loss than stay and starve to death. Or become an Alan Walker.'Walker is a former club pro - 10 years at the coalface - who realisedhe was a doomed species in a thriving industry, so he now has ahigh-volume shop adjoining his Warren Park driving range in Essex, plusa management company looking after a nearby pay-and-play course.Walker says that club pros have lost their retail business'frighteningly quickly. Five years ago it was a Pounds 130,000 averageturnover with a 35 per cent margin. That's all over.'His own shop turns over slightly more than Pounds 1m a year, but abranch of American Golf Discount has just opened on Walker's doorstep.'We're being hurt,' he admits. 'Teaching alone isn't the answer toreplacing lost income. Firstly, statistics show that the British arethe worst golfers in the world in terms of readiness to takeinstruction. Secondly, it's too seasonal. Who's having a lesson today?'He looked out of his office window as an arctic snow shower blastedacross the 14th green. Few issues currently occupy the ProfessionalGolfer's Association as intensely as the livelihoods of its 3,500members. As a result, a PGA working party is radically re-thinking theraison d'etre of the pro.It doesn't help that while the public image of the golf professional isNick Faldo or Ernie Els, superstars like those are a light year awayfrom the everyday work of the pro at the local club.When the PGA wanted a leading figure for a publicity campaign, it foundFaldo's fee unaffordable, so ended up using Nigel Mansell, one of thegame's better-known amateurs.Alan Walker is a committee member at the PGA and is deeply involved inthe process of reviewing future direction. As one experienced insiderput it: 'We have to stop training people for futures they are nevergoing to have. They're not going to be Woosnam or Norman, and nowthey're not going to be a successful shopkeeper, either.'Walker acknowledges the problems. 'At the end of the day we're allfailed players,' he says. 'I went into the game thinking I could playand was going to spend my days on the course winning tournaments, andI've ended up an accountant.' Later this month the PGA opens an Pounds8m training academy at its headquarters, The Belfry, the hotel coursein the English Midlands that has hosted several Ryder Cups.Leisure management and course architecture are much more important nowthan learning how to spend several hours repairing a persimmon-headeddriver for a tiny fee.The qualifications dished out at The Belfry will be equivalent to adegree. 'We've always been reluctant retailers, and the tour is for atiny minority, of whom 75 per cent won't cover their costs,' saysWalker. 'The jobs we've got to aim for are those of actually managingthe facilities, which in the past have gone to food and beveragespecialists or greenkeepers.'In the future, if your local club pro can't drive a computer and workthe local media, forget admiring his short game around the green.'If the pro can re-engineer himself to survive, what of the shop? We maynot buy much, but which weekend golfer doesn't enjoy a mooch around hisclub shop's over-stocked shelves?'It's history,' says Colin Hegarty. 'Marks and Spencer are alreadymoving into clothing in a huge way and the big chains will be sellingall the clubs and equipment. A starter's hut where you can buy a gloveand a ball - if you've forgotten to bring them - is the most likelyoutcome.'1995 UK Equipment Survey: Golf Research Group, Pounds 495.Tel:  0181-987-9950.

For once, the old Englishsystem of independent representative groups of well-informedindividuals appointed by the crown to guide our affairs workedbrilliantly, with the millennium commissioners proving themselves worththeir salt by refusing to allocate national lottery money for theproposed Cardiff Bay opera house.For too long Lord Crickhowell and his opera house trustees have beenled by the nose by London architectural groupies and admirers of thedesigns of Zaha Hadid, who won the competition to design the proposedopera house.The common sense of the minister, Virginia Bottomley, and hercommissioners will save Wales the embarrassment of a design that is notsupported by the people of Wales and is already dated.A Cardiff Bay opera house as a new home for the Welsh National Opera isa good idea, and no doubt a large theatre will be built there. Themistake was for the opera house trustees to believe they had to buildsomething approved by a narrow segment of the internationalarchitectural mafia.The jury for the competition was unrepresentative and innocent,seemingly prepared to let Miss Hadid's quaintly modern period piece goahead even though she had never built a serious building. Miss Hadid isreally a talented futurist painter - her work would have been avantgarde in turn of the century Russia. Today it is labelled'uncompromising' and 'exciting'. It is neither. The trendy Londonchatterers who influence people like Lord Crickhowell should be seenfor what they are: rearguard types trying to protect a brieflyfashionable designer. But Miss Hadid is no genius.The tragedy of the inevitable row about Cardiff Bay is that the failureof Miss Hadid's design will be seen as a triumph for the philistines.It is actually a dated, awkward design that only got this far throughendless lobbying. The millennium commissioners, who distribute part ofthe proceeds of the UK national lottery, have called the bluff of thetrendies.Sensible opera house trustees should look at the newest opera houses inthe world; meet their architects and managers; and choose someone withexperience. The trustees must start again with a good new architect.Life is tough, but Virginia Bottomley is tougher, and in this case sheand her commissioners are right.Last year, national lottery money gave a fillip to the UK'sarchitectural profession. The turnover of the British constructionindustry should benefit by some 5 per cent or so in the years to themillennium. It is large-scale projects that attract attention, but some90 per cent of lottery grants are for projects of less than Pounds 1m.Yet 1995 saw construction still in recession and architects onlybeginning to see green shoots of recovery fertilised by lottery cash.The secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, belatedlyrecognised the value of towns. His new planning policy guidance notes,to be issued early this year, will stress the value of mixeddevelopments. That is an almost complete volte face for the entireplanning system. If he is serious, Gummer will presumably bere-educating the entire planning profession at the new University ofGreenwich.He will have to start with the Corporation of the City of London which,since the inspired but disastrous experiment of the Barbican, hasabandoned any pretence that the City is more than a Square Mile ofoffices. The recent announcement of two big office schemes in EC4, andthe decision to encourage Mitsubishi to go back to the drawing board onthe Paternoster site, means the City may be in danger of becoming ahorizontal version of Canary Wharf.The opportunity at Paternoster to build a mixed development, givingMitsubishi the chance to build as many offices as it likes on, say,London Wall, must not be missed. In turn, the chance to move the Museumof London to a marvellous site next to St Paul's should be grasped, andwhy not have hotels and residential accommodation overlooking Wren'swonder?Architects in 1996 need to learn to be different kinds of animals.Those like Miss Hadid and Sir Richard Rogers (imminent adviser to thenew Labour party) who are wedded to dogma, are now old fashioned.Architects like Sir Michael Hopkins, Sir Norman Foster and RichardMacCormac are the leaders of the profession, and also admired by thepublic.That is a breakthrough, and one that has come about because the publicare under-estimated by architects at their peril. The public - you andme - understands the difference between quality and a dead cow informaldehyde. Virginia Bottomley and her commissioners understand thedifference, too. In 1996, quality and common sense may replace dogmaand fashionable nonsense. I live in hope.[London Page 12]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996ARTS:MAN OF MUSIC WITH PERIOD APPEAL - ANDREW CLARK TALKS TO THE CONDUCTORWHO CHALLENGES OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND OPENS OUR EARS TO THE PAST   By ANDREW CLARKThis looks like Roger Norrington's year. He opens and closes it inSalzburg, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic there later this month andreturning in December to rehearse Mozart's Mitridate for the 1997festival. In between there will be Berlioz with the LondonPhilharmonic, Dvorak in Boston, Henze in Basle, Elgar in Washington,Beethoven in Chicago, Nicholas Maw at the Proms and Brahms in Vienna -not forgetting three European tours with his own period-instrumentorchestra, the London Classical Players.Did someone say Norrington was a period specialist? If so, the periodranges pretty wide - from 1600 to 2000. That distinguishes him frommost early music pioneers. And he uses the same forensic skills tounravel Vaughan Williams and Part as he does for Beethoven and Bruckner- which sets him apart from other high-profile conductors. No Britishmusician has done more to challenge our assumptions or open our ears tothe past. At 61, Roger Norrington fully deserves the internationallimelight.He clearly enjoys it. The early music revolution, he says, is not aboutperiod instruments or a particular type of repertoire. 'It's a habit ofmind. Even if I didn't know anything about early music, I would stillbe the conductor I am now. I just can't look at a piece of musicwithout taking it back into the garage and stripping it down, findingwhat the hell is going on and putting it back together again. Vroom]'Earthy enthusiasm has always been a Norrington hallmark. It inspiredhis singers and orchestra at Kent Opera, where his 13 years as musicdirector gave him a vast repertory and an intimate understanding of howa company works. Enthusiasm has also been the key to his 'Experience'weekends, where he and the LCP discuss, rehearse and perform acomposer's work to the amused enlightenment of all. And it continues topermeate his day-to-day contact with conventional orchestras.'You don't often come across that kind of enthusiasm for the way themusic is realised,' said a member of the Basle Symphony Orchestra afterNorrington's latest visit. 'His contact with the players is amazinglylively - the orchestra had a great time. He got a humming performance,the music really took off.'Longstanding colleagues say Norrington has mellowed over the years. Hehas had two operations for cancer and become a father again: his wife,the choreographer Kay Lawrence, and their two-year-old son often travelwith him. 'But when it comes to the music, he's just as strict anddemanding as ever,' says an LCP stalwart. 'He has an incontrovertibleidea of how it should be. His point is that this is real music writtenby real people, and he gets that 'immediate' element across. He wantsto get round the traditional interpretation, demythologise the music,remove the waffle and ballast.'That is one of the reasons why Norrington now enjoys such a highprofile outside the UK. Long popular in the US and Italy, he has onlyrecently begun to make his presence felt in the Austro-Germanheartland. He says CDs have had a proselytising influence - 'they'resinking into the subconscious. People there are getting used to theidea that there are things they need to know about. Despite my roughGerman, the orchestras have been very responsive.'Norrington has not forgotten the UK. A former choral scholar atCambridge, he lives in Berkshire, organises the LCP's schedule with acouple of helpers and conducts 10 programmes a year with the LondonPhilharmonic. He says he is perfectly happy to work with moderninstruments. 'If you're changing the score - because many of thepublished scores are inaccurate - and you change the seating, thetempo, the phrasing, the light and shade, the Weltanschauung, italready makes a huge difference. But once they get used to the style,they may hesitantly say 'We're doing everything else, shouldn't we dropthe vibrato?'. That happened with the LPO, and the result wasabsolutely marvellous. As they begin to trust you, they realise you'renot going to turn up in a gown and mortar board. They see you're a realmusician.'Norrington's interest in historically aware performance began in theearly 1960s, when he went round the churches of Europe performingSchutz with his own amateur choir. There was no Schutz style: he had toinvent his own. From there it was but a short step to Bach, Telemannand Handel - and on to Gluck and Haydn, Beethoven and Berlioz, Schubertand Schumann. The journey has now reached Wagner and Bruckner, and theresults astonish Norrington as much as they do his admirers.In his LCP recording of the Meistersinger overture, Norrington knockstwo to three minutes off the standard performance length. 'I keepthinking that with the next thing we do, there won't be quite the samethings to discover,' he says. 'A year ago, we didn't know how Wagnerwould sound on period instruments. I thought the tempo wouldn't be abig question, it would be a matter of just hearing the same music onthese instruments. Then I started my research. In Ueber das Dirigieren,Wagner writes that when he conducted the Meistersinger overture, itlasted a few seconds over eight minutes. I thought wow] What will itsound like if we do that?'It was a revelation - less pompous and more humorous than usual, with aspring-in-the-step in the climaxes. There were similar results inBruckner's Third Symphony, which Norrington conducted at the LinzBruckner festival last autumn. He opted for the first version - the oneBruckner never heard, with none of the 'improvements' carried out byhis pupils for later performing versions. And he delved into Bruckner'sown recorded comments, which include references to a polka in thefinale.'What do most conductors do? They play it like a dirge. But if Brucknersays it's a polka, it's a polka. So I take it at a steady polka speed,which makes it sound like a dance - and the chorale suddenly becomessingable. All I'm trying to do is put the record straight, to believein the past. You don't set out to prove people wrong - you start as aninnocent, asking questions, and you stumble across these glaringlyobvious things.'Norrington says he deals with every composer's music in the same way:'I feel it, I get as much information as I can about it, and then I doit. I want to obey both sides - the heart and the head, they're inconstant creative tension. You can have the best intentions to followwhat the composer wants, but after a couple of days in rehearsal youmay find you're doing it quite differently - and that's how it shouldbe. In the end, feeling is king. It has to be your own vision.'For the past two summers he has conducted at the Rossini festival inPesaro. Was there much for him to contribute there? 'The management waskeen I should continue de-cloying Rossini - no high notes at the end,cadenzas as written, decorations with taste, tempi not too slow. Hedoesn't need to be livened up, but there's more allure in the phrasingthan he's given credit for. He's usually hijacked into 19th-centurystyle. But Zelmira was written in 1822. He went to Vienna and metBeethoven. These are fully classical works, in the sense that Beethovenis fully classical.'Norrington's journey into the past is far from finished. He visitsPrague in May to give the first historically aware performances ofSmetana's Ma Vlast. Given the chance, he would also take the LCP to theFestspielhaus at Bayreuth - 'the right orchestra in the right hall'. Hewants to play Tchaikovsky in St Petersburg, to do an 'Experience'weekend on Berg, and to conduct Lulu, Les Troyens and Meistersinger inthe opera house. He dreams of reviving the Early Opera Project, withwhich he toured Monteverdi's Orfeo in Italy in the 1980s. 'Historicalstaging is in the same state as early music was in 1960. The materialis all there. It just needs a mad entrepreneur with the right theatre.'Norrington admits that much of what he does is guess-work: it is ahazard of the road he has chosen to take. He may go wildly wrong attimes - that is the result of his risk-taking - but none of hisperformances has ever been dull or routine. Long may it stay that way.                          *      *      *-----------------------------------------------------------------------                        THE NORRINGTON EXPERIENCE-----------------------------------------------------------------------1934    Born March 16 at Oxford.1954-7  Choral scholar at Cambridge.1962    Founded Schutz Choir.1969-82 Conducted more than 30 operas, from Monteverdi to Tippett, as        music director of Kent Opera.1978    Formed London Classical Players, followed in 1984 by Early        Opera Project.1985    Haydn Experience, first of exploratory composer-weekends.1986    EMI contract led to his recording all Beethoven's symphonies        and much else on period instruments.

This is the motivation behind Battersea Arts Centre'sambitious current programme 'Telling Tales'. Alongside new Christianfables and fresh glosses on the European tales of the Brothers Grimm,it is refreshing to experience the contrasting oral tradition ofPersia: Alf Laylah Wa Laylah - Arabian Nights: The Tales ofSheherazade.The excitement starts when you enter the modest studio to find itre-formed. We sit cross-legged in-the-round, raised above the courtyardarcade beneath, peering into a shimmering arena which transforms fromking's bedroom to bustling bazaar, the banks of the Nile and the plainsbetween Cairo and Basra in the tiniest flicker of our mind's eye. 'Thishot land called Egypt' is conjured from nothing more than a fistful ofsand draining through a woman's fingers. Michael Gordon's direction andLiz Cooke's design create a compelling environment for their dedicatedcompany of ten focused performers. 'Listen,' they command: 'Listen.'It is the whim of King Shahrayar to execute his virgin brides afteronly one night, as a means of purging his kingdom of unfaithful Woman.He scapegoats them because of his own self-loathing: he murdered hisfirst queen in a fit of ill-founded jealousy. A strong-willed princess,the Sheherazade, is determined to end this needless sacrifice, andvolunteers to be his bride, but only after she has told her sister abedtime story - beautifully in Arabic - which intrigues the King. Soshe tells him more.The stories selected by the company are not of the Boys Own 'Ali Babaand the Forty Thieves' variety, but all craftily develop theproto-feminist theme. Each tale has jealous husbands wrongfullymurdering their wives for imagined infidelity, or women enduring sexand childbirth, and even broach pre-ordained marriage. Thisinterpretation of the exotic Arabic world of the Middle Ages as oneriddled with miscarriages of natural justice against women, pursues aclear agenda, but not one which is worn on the sumptuous sleeves of thewomen. The stories are elliptical, graceful and enchanting.There are stories within stories, tales chasing their own tales, richlyinterwoven like a magic carpet. The 75 minutes of storytelling does notonly reinvigorate a moribund king, but revivifies the wider audience.Suitable for older children, it could run for 1001 nights.At the BAC, London until January 7 (0171-223 2223).[London Page 13]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996ARTS (OPENINGS): AMSTERDAMMstislav Rostropovich joins the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra on Fridayfor a series of six concerts as cellist and conductor.

Inflationremained subdued, output grew by more than 2.5 per cent, unemploymentdeclined by more than 200,000 and government borrowing fell, albeit byless than was expected at the beginning of the year. In addition, MrKenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was able to take a penny off the basicrate of income tax and cut interest rates by a quarter of 1 percentagepoint.This very favourable mix of growth and inflation is rare by Britishhistorical standards and, while we think it likely to continue, thereare risks that the economy will not be as successful in 1996.The most striking aspect of the present economic situation is thevirtual absence of domestically generated inflation at a time ofrelatively fast growth and falling unemployment. This is partly areflection of the extent of disinflationary pressure in the UK labourmarket. Since the peak in unemployment in 1993, wage increases haveshown no sign of picking up and real wages have scarcely grown. Thismeans that the benefits of increased productivity have beenappropriated into profit margins. These have risen substantially:profits as a proportion of gross domestic product - at 36 per cent in1994 - are higher than in the early 1970s.One important question in present circumstances is whether thesurprising lack of growth in wage rates is evidence - as claimed by theTreasury - that the sustainable rate of unemployment has fallen. In the1980s and early 1990s it seemed that this figure was about 8 per centof the labour force. Certainly, when the unemployment rate fell to 5.5per cent by 1990, there was a sharp acceleration in inflation which wasonly squeezed out by the rise in unemployment during the lastrecession.Assuming productivity growth of 2 per cent a year, the rate of increasein wages could probably rise from its existing level of 3.25 per centto 4.5 per cent per annum and still be consistent with annual inflationof 2.5 per cent and very high profit margins. This suggests thatunemployment at 8 per cent is still above its sustainable rate.It would be premature, however, to assume from this that thesustainable rate of unemployment has indeed fallen. Unit labour costspicked up noticeably in 1995 and in manufacturing were growing inOctober at an annual rate of 4 per cent. This probably reflects thestagnation of productivity associated with the slowdown in output. Butit may be an early indication that unemployment is reaching itssustainable level.If the sustainable unemployment rate has fallen, it will be possiblefor output to grow for some time to come at more than its underlyingtrend rate without generating inflationary pressure. This does notguarantee that the chancellor's inflation target of 2.5 per cent by theend of the present parliament will be met - the weakness of domesticprices has been offset by increases in import prices arising fromsterling's depreciation of close to 7 per cent through 1995.We expect the underlying inflation rate by the end of 1996 to beslightly over 3 per cent. A better way of putting this is to say thatwe think there is only a 40 per cent chance of meeting the inflationtarget. There is also a risk that inflation will be substantiallyhigher if faster growth in import prices feeds through to domesticprices.This assessment depends on the outlook for demand, which appears tohave stalled in the second half of 1995, leading to fears that theoverall rate of growth in 1996 will be considerably slower. This timelast year the National Institute forecast growth of 2.7 per cent for1995, and this is likely to be very close to the eventual out-turn. For1996, we are predicting growth of 2.4 per cent, much lower than theTreasury's forecast of 3 per cent.Our forecast assumes that continued weakness in domestic demand will beoffset by higher export demand, helped by the fall in sterling in 1995.Individual monthly figures are erratic, but it was gratifying to seehigher exports in November as an early indication of this trend.We do not expect much of a feelgood factor to develop in 1996. This ispartly due to the very slow growth in wages.There is at present much discussion about whether the economy will belifted by a surge in consumer spending, with the suggestion thatspending is depressed by consumer gloom inspired by fears aboutemployment prospects. But the truth is that consumers are behavingperfectly normally. It looks as though they will have saved about 9 percent of their income in 1995 and we are expecting a similar figure for1996. This is lower than in any year since 1971, except during the boomperiod of 1986 to 1990 - and we doubt consumers are ready for a bingelike that of the late 1980s.In spite of the pause in growth, we expect a continuing fall inclaimant unemployment to about 1.9m, or just under 7 per cent of thelabour force. This is partly due to changes in the administration ofbenefits. While we expect some acceleration in wage growth, this willbe consistent with a downwards drift in the inflation rate as the rateof increase in import prices subsides. Profit margins will stop rising,but there will be no great pressure on them.The main risk of this forecast is that demand will be weaker thanexpected as a consequence of companies adjusting to an unintendedbuild-up of stocks, tight fiscal policy and possible weakness in demandfor British exports. In this event, inflationary pressure should weakenfurther and we would expect to see cuts in interest rates to maintainthe economy's momentum as the next general election approaches.In the longer term, we expect these favourable trends to continue. Theimproved picture in the labour market will be backed up by slightlyfaster productivity growth as the economy starts to benefit from therecent expansion of higher education and, we hope, the more stablemacroeconomic environment established since sterling left the Europeanexchange rate mechanism. We can see the growth rate accelerating to 2.8per cent and unemployment falling to 1.2m. This would not exactly be aneconomic miracle, but it would at least make a pleasant change from theyears of stop-go.Martin Weale is director of the National Institute of Economic andSocial Research, a UK research institute, and a member of theTreasury's panel of independent economic forecasters.

ROACHThe financial markets always want more of a good thing. And that seemsto be the case in looking to 1996. It is fashionable to worry that theUS economy is soft and getting softer, and that inflation is headingdramatically lower. In such an environment, the Federal Reserve isexpected to reduce short-term interest rates aggressively. Moreover,with the budget deal of a lifetime finally thought to be at hand, mostforecasters expect a dramatic further rally in the bond market.Needless to say, such a scenario hardly poses a threat to the gloriousbull market of 1995.Our prognosis for the US economy in 1996 is at odds with many of thesepresumptions. I expect neither a boom nor a bust. Real gross domesticproduct is likely to expand in a 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent range -essentially in line with what I believe to be the US economy'sunderlying long-term growth potential. The case for upside growthsurprises is relatively straightforward. It is based on solid supportfrom three important macroeconomic forces: real income generation (atpresent running above trend at 3.7 per cent); interest rates (which arenear historic lows); and the currency (which is vastly undervalued).In such a constructive environment, I expect the US economy to showsurprisingly broad-based gains in 1996. With mortgage interest ratesdown about 200 basis points over the past year, the turnround in theresidential construction sector should continue well into the new year.And there should be no let-up in US business's record-setting boom incapital spending.This is a structural phenomenon - triggered mainly by spectacularproductivity breakthroughs - that should continue to be surprisinglyimmune to the whims of the business cycle.Upside surprises in the export sector can also be expected, reflectingthe combined effects of a supercompetitive US economy and more diversetrade flows. The strong impetus for export growth in 1995 - with unitvolume growth accelerating from 4.8 per cent in the first quarter to10.6 per cent in the third - stands in sharp contrast to widespreadfears that there will be an export collapse in a sluggish globaleconomy.The good news is that the US is less dependent on its traditionaltrading partners: sales to Europe and Japan have fallen to 34 per centof overall US exports, down sharply from 42 per cent at the end of1990.Finally, reports of the demise of the American consumer are vastlyexaggerated. With consumption well supported by income generation, I donot share the widespread conviction that households are being draggeddown by excess debts. The ratio of annual debt servicing expenses toincome stands at present at 16.8 per cent, well below the highs hit inthe latter half of the 1980s. While I do not expect a consumer buyingbinge, the forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in real consumption through1996 is sufficient to account for over 1.5 percentage points of realGDP growth.The inflation prognosis is particularly intriguing. While I continue tobelieve the cost-efficient, productivity-led US recovery remainsintact, I am now of the view that the inflation rate is slowly movingup from its cyclical lows. The consumer price index rose 2.9 per centin 1995, up 0.3 percentage points from the low of 1994, and a littlemore acceleration in 1996 is expected, to an annual rate of 3.2 percent.I do not share the view that price stability is now at hand. The bulkof the disinflation of the 1990s has been a by-product of anextraordinary compression of labour costs. With productivity andcorporate profitability surging, with the unemployment rate at 5.6 percent, and with real compensation virtually stagnant for over a decade,I do not accept the notion that a submissive workforce has no choicebut to capitulate further on wages.In spite of the supposed threat of the dollar-a-day Chinese worker,this strain of productivity enhancement has now gone far enough. Thedays of asking the labour force to keep sacrificing for the noble causeof disinflation appear to be largely over. The risk of a backlash fromworkers is a growing concern - one that might have an important impacton the sociology, politics and economics of the US for years to come.As for the Fed, it is hard to accept the widespread conviction than anaggressive monetary easing is now at hand.Given the outlook for the economy and inflation, the urgency for afurther dramatic easing just is not there. Granted, the central bankmay offer a token easing in the aftermath of a budget accord. But ifmarket expectations of sharply lower short-term interest rates wererealised, the Fed would have to throw its traditional caution to thewind. If it takes its commitment to price stability seriously, and Ibelieve it does, it is difficult to imagine the Fed turning away fromthe restrictive policy bias that worked so well in the 1980s.The budget is obviously the wild card. The problem is that it is stillbusiness as usual in Washington. The best we are likely to see is aplan based on back-loaded spending cuts, front-loaded tax cuts,immunity for social security and dubious economic assumptions (forexample, that the perfect path of trend growth, low inflation anddeclining interest rates continues forever). I have come to thereluctant conclusion that the same creative mathematicians who gave usGramm-Rudman I and II and the great budget accord of 1990 are hard atwork today. Credible deficit reduction remains a dream, not acertainty.Adding it all up, it is hard to be thrilled about US Treasury bonds.Everything good is just about priced into the market. On the chancethat a budget deal is struck - even if it is a classic smoke-and-mirrors compromise - a final bull run to bond yields of 5 1/2 per centis possible.But as reality sinks in, and the economy and inflation fail to conformto market hopes, I continue to believe that the next big move in bondsis back towards an equilibrium level of 7 per cent. I expect such acorrection to take place by mid-year, at the latest.The author is chief economist and director of global economic analysisat Morgan Stanley[London Page 14]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:WAYS TO VIEW SUPPORT FOR STEELMAKING PLANTSir, In the US we have been reading with interest the reports thatBritish Steel is seeking to close an Irish steel plant on account ofsubsidies that the Irish government is to provide.In the US British Steel is seeking one of the biggest subsidies fromthe taxpayer ever recorded in order to operate a steel plant inAlabama, which British Steel is proposing to build in partnership withan American and a Japanese company.Support worth Dollars 250m is being sought from - and granted by - thestate legislature of Alabama in order to persuade British Steel and itstwo partners to open the steel plant in the state. If built, the plantwill directly threaten the jobs of at least 3,500 steelworkers in otherparts of the country.Without entering into the merits of the Irish steel plant's case, wefind it puzzling that British Steel is so hostile to subsidies inEurope and so ravenous for them in the US.Transatlantic trade and co-operation can not be built on this kind oftilted playing field.George Becker,international president,United Steelworkers of America,Five Gateway Centre,Pittsburgh, PA 15222,US[London Page 14]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:CANADIAN PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE TRAPPER'S SNARESir, Thank you for Bernard Simon's comprehensive article ('Hunting fora kinder kill', December 13).

It has exploitedthem, their culture and their way of life. Native people do notprocess, sell or store furs but are at the bottom of the fur industrychain.Because of the sympathy people feel towards the plight of the Canadiannative people, the Canadian government and the fur industry arepromoting the myth that trapping is culturally and economically centralto the native people.Fewer than 50 per cent of native homes are fully serviced with sewerageand water, native infant mortality is 60 per cent higher than theaverage among other Canadians, and 70 per cent of natives have not hada high school education.Fur trapping has not and will not relieve these problems.

Democracies have been votedout, and there is no evidence that the increasing gap between rich andpoor will not weaken many democracies.It is curious that Protestant societies were the first to nourishdemocratic institutions, and that no non-Protestant society hassustained democracy for longer than 70 years.

Thedefection from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats of Miss EmmaNicholson could not have been a more potent reminder of the fragilityof Mr John Major's government. The prime minister's parliamentarymajority is now down, in effect, to three. Further deaths or defectionscould soon eliminate it entirely.Mr Major appears determined to defer the election until the lastpossible date in the spring of 1997, relying if necessary on thesupport of the Ulster Unionists to sustain him in any vote ofconfidence. Privately, opposition leaders admit that he may wellsucceed in that objective. But, amid rumours of further defections,ministers equally are obliged to acknowledge they can no longer becertain of the parliamentary arithmetic. An autumn election is now areal possibility if not yet a probability.The prime minister would be wise to pay close attention to the messageof Miss Nicholson's defection. Since his leadership victory lastsummer, Mr Major has been too anxious to appease his opponents byspeaking the language of the Eurosceptic right of the Tory party.Whatever her personal motives for joining Mr Paddy Ashdown's LiberalDemocrats, Miss Nicholson's charge that the government has beendeserting the political centre ground finds a dangerous echo amongvoters.Rhetoric calculated to appeal to the more hardline Conservativeactivists will not recover for Mr Major the support of the lesscommitted voters who will decide the outcome of the election. Mr Blairhas learned one of the golden rules of British politics - elections arenot won from the extremes of left or right but from the centre.Gruelling businessEither way, the looming campaign promises to be a gruelling andunedifying business. Politics, it seems, leaves little room these daysfor policy. The normal business of government has been suspended. MrMajor's legislative programme is designed above all to minimisecontroversy within his own party and to highlight areas of differencewith Labour. Mr Tony Blair meanwhile concentrates on inflictingtactical defeats on the government at Westminster. Those expectingLabour to unfold a detailed blueprint for government are likely to bedisappointed.As they make their promises and level their charges in the scramble forvotes, however, Messrs Major, Blair and Ashdown should pause for amoment to reflect on a more worrying feature of British political life.Politicians of all parties have rarely been held in lower publicesteem. They have themselves, mostly, to blame.Wider developmentsIt is true that wider developments have contributed to a generalweakening of faith in the ability of politicians to 'solve' nationalproblems. Global markets have delineated more clearly the limits ofeconomic independence. The necessary sharing of sovereignty in Europehas robbed Westminster of other pretensions. But to acknowledge suchtrends is not to exonerate the politicians.The important gap is not that between the limits imposed by the harshrealities of modern life and the unreasonable demands of the voters.The real disillusion stems from the gulf between promises andperformance. If politicians more readily acknowledged the constraints,the voters would be more willing to adjust their expectations. Instead,the parties wittingly exaggerate their power, promising easy solutionsto complex problems.To take the most obvious example: the central debate about the rightlevels of public spending and taxation is conducted with shamelessmendacity. One side promises painless tax cuts, the other perfectpublic services. The reality is that modest rates of economic growthwill allow neither for the constant ratcheting down of income tax ratespromised by Mr Major nor the cost-free and comprehensive welfare statepledged by Mr Blair.It is perhaps too much to expect the politicians to mend their ways soclose to an election. But this erosion of trust and confidence inparliament is inimical to good government and dangerously corrosive ofdemocracy. Ultimately, the politicians as well as the voters will bethe losers.[London Page 15]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996LEADING ARTICLE:ITALY AND THE EU PRESIDENCYFor the fourth time in a row, the six months' presidency of theEuropean Union has fallen to a member state whose government isseverely distracted by domestic difficulties. It seems to be becoming abad habit. First there was Germany, with a general election inmid-presidency back in 1994. Then there was France, with presidentialelections last May. The Spanish government in the past six monthsmanaged to postpone its demise in order to complete its EUchairmanship, in spite of losing its parliamentary majority.Now Italy is supposed to take the chair, not even sure if it has agovernment. Mr Lamberto Dini offered his resignation on Saturday aftercompleting his limited mandate. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro wantshim to stay on, but he is leaving it to the fractious Italianparliament to decide. It hardly makes for firm leadership and a clearagenda for Europe.Those four Euro-enthusiastic governments were supposed to co-ordinatetheir plans for the two-year period. They intended to lay thegroundwork for a clear-sighted and coherent inter-governmentalconference this year, which would mark another important step towardsthe goal of European political union. Instead, the EU is stumblingtowards that target in a familiar state of muddle.Spanish achievementsAdmittedly, Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain achieved rathermore in the past six months than one might have expected from itspolitical weakness at home. It completed preparations for the IGC,albeit with more modest ambitions than committed integrationists wouldlike. It persuaded the other 14 member states to agree a blueprint forthe launch of the single currency in 1999. It finalised a programme toreinforce the fragile relationship between the EU and US. And itorganised an impressive gathering of Mediterranean states to cementbetter co-operation between Europe, the middle east and north Africa.Not bad for a lame-duck administration.The challenge for Mr Dini, or any other head of an Italian government,is to keep that good work going. At least he does not appearover-ambitious. Italy has not tabled any heavy agenda of nationalpriorities, as other member states are sometimes tempted to do. Asuccessful launch to the IGC at the end of March is one priority;agreement on a reconstruction plan for Bosnia is another. The formershould be a formality, but the latter could be a very difficultnegotiation: the European Union must be generous if it wants the peaceinitiative in Bosnia to succeed, but every member state faces toughdomestic budget constraints, limiting the room for manoeuvre.Difficult issuesThere are always other difficult issues on the EU agenda which requireclear leadership from the presidency. In the next six months thoseinclude the plans to liberalise the EU energy market; reform of theTacis aid programme for countries of the former Soviet Union; andreform of the EU wine market. There is also strong German pressure foragreement on a stabilisation package to regulate the behaviour ofmember states after creation of economic and monetary union. These areall issues on which Italy has clear national interests, and on which aweak government in Rome may find it difficult to compromise, let alonenegotiate a deal.A strong Italian government is out of the question for the foreseeablefuture. At this moment, early elections would not solve the problem:under the present electoral laws, they are unlikely to produce a resultmuch different from the present stalemate. President Scalfaro is rightto urge the main political factions to stop bickering and agree on aprogramme of essential constitutional reforms. That could be enacted bya broad-based cross-party coalition, as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, theformer prime minister, appears to favour - though this seems somewhatunrealistic.Alternatively, Mr Dini could be asked to serve on for another sixmonths, dedicated to the EU presidency and to securing theconstitutional reforms. That would be an acceptable compromise, in theinterests of Italy and Europe.[London Page 15]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EUROPE UNLOCKED FOR DEALERS: ON THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING UNDER NEWRULES BREAKING DOWN EU BORDERS, JOHN GAPPER AND RICHARD LAPPER ASSESSWHO THE WINNERS AND LOSERS WILL BE   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD LAPPERThis morning NatWest Securities will commence trading on the SwedishStock Exchange from its offices in the City of London. For the firsttime, the stockbroking arm of the British bank will buy and sell sharesin Swedish companies without having to do so through local brokers. 'Wecan sit in London with a screen on our desks, and trade as if we werein Stockholm,' says Mr Scott Dobbie, chairman of NatWest Securities.The ability to trade securities across borders in this way is a productof the European Union's Investment Services Directive (ISD), whichtakes effect today. The directive aims to give Europe's thousands ofbroking firms a 'passport' to trade anywhere in the Union, and isaccompanied by the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) which imposes freshcapital requirements.Progress in implementing the two directives is likely to be slow - byDecember 31, only seven of the 15 EU states had passed the necessarylegislation. But whatever the delays, the changes are happening fasterthan previous efforts to harmonise banking supervision. 'It is far morecomplex, and it is having to be accomplished in a much shorter time,'says Ms Jane Welch, head of legal advice at the UK Securities andInvestments Board.And the impact on Europe's stock exchanges and derivatives markets willbe far-reaching. The directives are likely to favour larger investmentbanks and stock exchanges, at the expense of smaller firms andexchanges.There are two key measures in the Investment Services Directive. Thefirst is that firms will be able to operate in any EU member state,provided they are regulated in one of them. When operating outsidetheir home countries, they will be subject to rules on the conduct ofbusiness devised by the local regulators for all banks and brokers.For the larger banks already operating in more than one EU country, the'passport' rule will reduce costs and ease the regulatory burden.However, the directive is unlikely to make a significant difference totheir operations. Although there have been instances of member statesimposing strict requirements on foreign banks, most of them have beenable to operate where they want. 'We have never felt constrained aboutcrossing national borders,' says Mr Wilco Jiskoot, senior executivevice-president for merchant banking at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.But for smaller firms operating in countries with no regulation forsecurities traders, the directive will mean being regulated for thefirst time - together with the accompanying costs, even if they areoperating purely in their domestic markets. They are also likely tolose the share of commission and fees they make in carrying out localbusiness for large investment banks. From today smaller brokers willhave to find a substitute for such earnings if they are to survive.The second key measure of the directive is to allow stock exchanges andfutures and options markets to trade throughout the EU. With increasingvolumes of equity dealing, derivatives business and bond markettransactions carried out electronically, this should in effect allowbrokers to conduct business from offices located anywhere in Europe.The effect will be to increase competition between Europe's 32securities exchanges and 24 derivatives markets. Already, for example,the Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and derivativesmarkets, plans to extend its electronic network to several othercountries. Early this year it is opening an access point in London,which will reduce the telecommunications costs for London-basedDeutsche Bo rse members to transact their business directly withFrankfurt.It is widely expected that many smaller exchanges could fold as thesepressures intensify. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, chairman of the Matif, theParis-based futures market, expects a wave of restructuring with somederivatives markets disappearing, either through merger or takeover.'It will mean some substantial modification in the landscape of futuresand options exchanges in Europe,' he says.Matif is planning to launch an ambitious joint electronic network withthe Deutsche Borse and two other French exchanges later this year whichwould allow traders to deal in French and German equities over the samescreens. It would also cover a range of futures and options products.'With the prospect of a single currency it all amounts to a new bigbang in Europe as far as the markets are concerned,' says Mr Pfauwadel.One target for European exchanges such as Paris and Frankfurt is likelyto be the London Stock Exchange's Seaq-I electronic bulletin board,which marketmakers use to advertise large blocks of European shares forpurchase and sale. Already, European bourses which have invested alarge amount on modernising their trading and settlement systems havewon back dealing business in local equities from Seaq-I.But many market participants argue that large exchanges - particularlyLondon - are likely to gain rather than lose from the directive.NatWest's strategy of trading increasingly on local exchanges ratherthan on Seaq-I does not lessen its commitment to its main base inLondon. Remote trading on overseas exchanges could help London's roleas the physical location from which traders operate by electronicmeans.Mr Giles Vardey, director of markets development at the London StockExchange, argues that remote trading is now 'commercially inevitable'.Mr Vardey accepts that competition from large exchanges will intensify,but says smaller exchanges could suffer. 'Trading power is likely tobecome concentrated in London, and the directive will hasten thisprocess,' he says.The most immediate effects of Capital Adequacy Directive are likely tobe felt by the investment banks. They will be required for the firsttime to allocate capital to cover risks of losses through adversemovements in the markets for shares, bonds or currencies. At themoment, banks have to allocate capital only to cover lending risksunder the 1988 Basle accord of international supervisors.The new rules also demand that banks and securities firms monitor theirrisks at all times keeping a permanent watch on large exposures. Forexample, trading exposures to a single customer will have to be limitedin most cases to less than 25 per cent of capital base - and can onlybe exceeded with the national regulator's permission. The larger banksare best placed to comply with such demands, having invested hugeamounts over the past few years in systems to allow them to monitortheir exposure.Smaller banks are less prepared. 'Developing the ability to spot largeexposures across the business is a significant headache for manyplayers,' says Mr Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and capitalmarkets at Price Waterhouse, the accountants. 'It imposes a level ofintegration that only the top few players have.'In theory, the Capital Adequacy Directive could lead to some bankshaving to set aside significantly more capital. But most banks believethat the directive's impact will be minimal. Mr Ian Linnell, bankinganalyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, says for mostthe impact has been 'neutral to marginal', and believes that some bankswill be able to operate with less capital than before.However, there could be extra burdens for those banks which are heavilyinvolved in equities trading, for which Capital Adequacy Directiverules are stiffer in some cases. For example, BZW, the investmentbanking arm of Barclays, will have to put aside a little more capital,according to Mr David Band, chief executive.But the biggest impact so far has arisen from the need to invest inupgrading technology to comply with the directive's requirements tomonitor group operations globally. Some of the bigger banks have spentup to Pounds 5m on systems and software, and even the smaller firmsface minimum costs of Pounds 50,000 to pay for software. Mr Band saysthere has been a shortage of technicians in London able to work on banksystems. 'That has been a big problem for the market,' he says.As the directives come into action this morning, the immediatebeneficiaries look to be the large investors who increasingly tradeacross European borders and are likely to see a reduction in charges.In the longer term, the winners will be the large investment banks,many of which are now based in London. The losers will be the smaller,less efficient brokers and the smaller exchanges that cannot find arole as the EU's stock and derivatives markets become increasinglyintegrated.[London Page 15]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OBSERVER: NATWEST SEEKS TOP GUNWhat will the NatWest Group do with Dollars 3.6bn that it is raisingfrom the sale of its US retail banking business to Fleet Financial? Notso long ago NatWest was the biggest of the Big Four UK banks. Now it isthe smallest. So the money should come in handy helping fulfil itsambition to transform NatWest Markets into one of the top 10 globalinvestment banks.Although NatWest appears to have ruled out bidding for a well-knownWall Street name, like Lehman Brothers, it will have to buy something,or someone, if it wants to be a serious player in the big league. InOctober it paid a hefty Dollars 135m for Eric Gleacher's five-year-oldUS mergers and acquisition boutique. Gleacher, 55, made his namerunning Morgan Stanley's M&A department during some of the biggesthostile takeover battles in the 1980s. Now he has made his fortune byselling out to NatWest.As long as Gleacher hangs around, NatWest Markets has a chance of beingtaken seriously in the domestic US investment banking market. However,Gleacher is not an international player and NatWest Markets desperatelyneeds to beef up its global investment banking team if it wants tocompete with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley etc.Hence the owners of some European corporate finance boutiques must behoping that NatWest will be as generous to them as it was to Gleacher.After all, when Morgan Grenfell was looking for a new chief executivein 1987, it had to pay Pounds 15m for John Craven's Phoenix Securitiesto secure Craven's services.The obvious UK candidate is Hambro Magan's George Magan who worked forMorgan Grenfell before starting his own boutique in 1988. He is a goodfive years younger than Gleacher and has an equally impressive recordin the UK M&A market. But would Magan join NatWest Markets for lessthan Gleacher?Surely not.

Othergovernments have expressed concern about accepting the 'passport'.Market officials say the seven which have to all intents and purposesmet the requirements of the directive on time are the UK, the Republicof Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.In some of these, however, the legislation itself still needs to bepassed. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and France are expected tointroduce the legislation by the middle of this year. Germany, Greeceand Spain will not be prepared for full implementation until 1997.Some countries such as France and Italy have used the enablinglegislation for the directive to push through broader financialregulatory reforms, which has held up progress.There are already strong links between the Frankfurt and Parisderivatives markets which are expected to deepen in the coming months,but the directive should extend links throughout Europe.In Germany, this will create considerable new work for the FederalSupervisory office for Securities Trading (BAWe), which was set up onlya year ago to root out insider traders and enforce compliance withstricter disclosure requirements. Analysts believe the main effect ofthe directive may be less to encourage financial institutions to openoffices in other countries than to change the location of wheretransactions are carried out - reinforcing the position of thosemarkets which already have the greatest liquidity for any particularsecurity.Mr Giuseppe Zadra, director general of the Italian banking association,said he feared the focus of trading in Italian instruments could shiftto other markets if his country's institutions did not invest andmodernise. 'National markets don't have a future, and that's why theywill have to be changed and compete on a European scale,' he said.The new rules have also raised fears there will be new risks forinvestors because institutions receiving their passport in the countrywith the weakest regulatory requirements will be able to obtainrecognition elsewhere.'I have already heard anecdotally that some dubious firms from outsideEurope are looking for the best place to get initial authorisation,'said one stock market official.

Inflation is low and apparently under control; growth may haveslowed, but most economies will still expand this year; and the USeconomy's soft landing looks convincing enough.But after last year's bull run, there is much less to go for. In 1995,inflation fears proved overdone, allowing interest rates to be cut. Theresulting bond market rally, coupled with bid activity, fuelledadvances in stock prices.Even though there are more interest rate cuts to come, the pace isslowing and much of the benefit is already priced into both bonds andstocks. Furthermore, the US market, which led the way last year, looksrather overvalued. The stock market, having risen more than 30 per centlast year, faces a proliferation of earnings downgrades. Since earningsare not likely to fall off a cliff, a slowdown in economic growth doesnot necessarily mean stock prices will stall. But the market looksexpensive relative to trend earnings and bond yields. Dividend yieldsare low, even when share buy-back programmes are taken into account.The benign economic environment probably rules out a 1987- style crash,but a correction is not only likely, it would probably be beneficial.And there are several potential triggers: the US budget agreement, forexample, has still to be thrashed out.[London Page 16]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996THE LEX COLUMN:EUROPEA correction in the US would hit the UK hardest, since it has benefitedmost from the bull run. Although strong earnings growth is likely tocontinue into 1997, the UK has other problems, including the growingpossibility of an early election, as the Conservative party's majoritydwindles. In fact, Prime Minister John Major is likely to hold on topower until 1997 even without a majority, but any weakening of hiscontrol over the election's timing will be viewed as a negative by thestock market.The UK also has more to fear from inflation than most other markets,given its relatively rapid economic growth and an expected rise inconsumer spending. This will benefit some sectors, such ashousebuilding and retailing, but the danger is that any further ratecuts in the first half of the year will have to be reversed in thesecond - or worse that the government may try to ignore overheating ofthe economy, since raising rates in the run-up to the election wouldhardly be politically expedient. With gilts currently yielding twice asmuch as equities, the balance looks about right. But inflation jitterscould cap gilt prices, halting further equity advances.Further bid activity, as in the US, will help underpin stock marketprices, but estimates that the FT-SE 100 index, whatever early gains itmakes, will end the year around 3,750, less than 100 points above itscurrent level, are probably sensible.In continental Europe, the problem is too little growth. This bodeswell for bonds. Even without further short-term rate cuts in Germany,there is room for bond yields to fall. More generally, any signs thatthe structural problems of high social spending and unwieldy budgetdeficits are being addressed should encourage investors. Bunds andother European bond markets may well outperform the US market in 1996 -the problem is the strongest outperformance is often on the way down,so it may be safer to bet on yield differentials than on absolute pricemovements.[London Page 16]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996THE LEX COLUMN:JAPANTokyo's Nikkei-225 has ended the year roughly where it started, justbelow 20,000, inviting the question of whether US and European fundmanagers are right to increase their weighting in Japan. Few marketshave performed as well over the past six months. The index has gained37 per cent since its July low, though the yen's decline over thatperiod has eroded more than half that gain when measured in dollars.Currency risk will continue to bedevil foreign investors as economicrecovery sucks in more imports, further driving down the trade surplus.But the attraction of Japan in 1996 is that it is the only leadingmarket set to benefit both from the early stage of an economic revivaland a pick-up in corporate earnings. A rise in sales should kick in, ontop of the margin improvements achieved over the past year.On the surface, much of this recovery has already been discounted, withthe index standing at around 83 times prospective earnings - high evenby Japan's historical standards. However, a more useful guide to theNikkei's value is the ratio between equity and bond yields. Currently,Japanese government bonds yield 1.5 times as much as equities, wellbelow the long-term average. As a result, Japanese institutions, heavynet sellers of equities last year, may well favour equities over bondsin 1996. The top Japanese life insurers and brokers have shed recentpessimism and forecast a 1996 high for the Nikkei in the mid-20,000s.They may be right.[London Page 16]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996THE LEX COLUMN:EMERGING MARKETSEmerging markets look cheap. On most valuation measures, a rebound isalready overdue. Last year's lacklustre performance partly reflects thecrisis of confidence following the collapse of the Mexican market atthe start of the year. In fact, international investors had littlereason to take the higher risks associated with emerging markets. USfund managers in particular were able to make impressive returns intheir own domestic market.But there are signs that US money is starting to move offshore again.As fund managers are forced to look for growth outside the domesticmarket, emerging markets are bound to get at least some of that money.Typically, US managers have looked south of the border. But there arestill good reasons for avoiding Latin America, not only because of thedire economic problems which continue to afflict some countries. Themain bond market is the dollar-denominated Brady bond market, whichwould suffer from a US market correction. Slow growth, particularly byemerging markets standards, makes stock markets relativelyunattractive, given the associated currency risk.Asian stock markets look a better bet. Not only does Asia enjoy strongeconomic growth and a cash surplus; the markets are likely to benefitfrom funds from Japan, as well as the US and UK.[London Page 16]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996PENSION FUNDS RAISE RETURNS BUT MISS OUT ON BIG US GAINS   By GEORGE GRAHAMUK pension funds recovered from their poor performance in 1994 withinvestment returns averaging 19 per cent last year, according to asurvey by the WM Company.Pension funds benefited from a return of almost 24 per cent on UKequities, which make up more than half of their portfolios.But they missed out on the big gains in the US stock market, whichreturned 33.8 per cent last year. Only 4.3 per cent of the Pounds 380bnof funds measured by WM was invested in US equities.'Everybody thought the US was overpriced at the end of 1994 but itreally took off,' said Mr Peter Warrington, a director of WM, whichspecialises in performance measurement.He added that the longer-term performance of UK pension fundsdemonstrated consistently impressive results. Whether measured overfive years or 20 years, they showed the same average annual return of15.3 per cent, nearly twice the rate of inflation.'In the mid-1980s, people were saying that equities couldn't go onproducing these high returns. We had disappointing years in 1990 and1994, but over five years there is still a positive return of 16.7 percent on equities,' Mr Warrington said.Property has proved a more disappointing investment for pension funds.Although it was the best-performing sector in 1994, in 1995 propertyproduced a return of only 5.3 per cent, compared with a return for allother sectors of 20.1 per cent. Over five years, property returns haveaveraged 6.0 per cent, and property sank to 5.1 per cent of totalpension fund assets at the end of the year.WM's survey, which covers about 80 per cent of UK pension funds,reveals little change in the mix of assets held by managers, despitewidespread discussion of a tendency to 'rebalance' portfolios with morefixed-income investments and less equity.Some actuaries and investment managers have argued that pension fundsare maturing, with fewer members now actively contributing and morereceiving benefits. That should mean funds will increase bond holdingsto provide a more guaranteed stream of income.But the funds measured by WM held 77.5 per cent of their portfolios inequities last year compared with 76.6 per cent at the end of 1994.Holdings of UK and overseas bonds, other than index-linked, alsoincreased, but only to 9.9 per cent.'All the talk we have heard about funds maturing and moving into bondshasn't materialised,' said Mr Warrington.[London Page 16]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996CHANGES SOUGHT IN TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance CorrespondentReform of the government-backed terrorist insurance scheme, which wasintroduced after the 1992 IRA attack on the City, is being urged amidfears that some companies may be inadequately covered.The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers is worried thatbusinesses are having to pay excessively high premium rates, which areforcing them to make a difficult choice between buying cover or riskhaving to bear the cost of a terrorist incident.Insurance industry estimates suggest that less than half of thosebusinesses which buy commercial property insurance purchase fullterrorism cover, although many have their own 'captive' insurancecompanies providing dedicated insurance cover. Others could cover thecost of an incident from other resources.However, Ms Ina Barker, executive director of the association, said:'The danger is that a lot of big businesses do not have enoughterrorism cover and are therefore putting business at risk.' Such fearscould intensify if the IRA ceasefire broke down.Airmic hopes to hold talks with the Department of Trade and Industryabout possible reform to Pool Re, the state-backed mutual reinsurancecompany. This was set up in 1993 to ensure that conventional insurancecompanies could provide terrorism cover to commercial clients.Pool Re members - which include most of the main UK-based commercialinsurance providers - have to supply terrorism insurance on fixedterms and rates. Premiums collected by insurers are pooled and used topay any claims. If Pool Re ran out of money, the government would makeup the shortfall.Since the IRA ceasefire was announced last year, premium rates havefallen. But buyers and brokers say the system remains inflexible andexpensive.Airmic is proposing a scheme in which all commercial property policieswould include a flat contribution towards the costs of Pool Re,allowing a return to the automatic provision of cover against terroristattack.Policy attacked, Page 7[London Page 16]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996COMPANY NEWS (THIS WEEK):CHRISTMAS BRINGS CHEER TO TRADING STATEMENTS - UK RETAILERS   By NEIL BUCKLEYExpect to hear news of another strong Christmas as large retailers maketheir January trading statements, writes Neil Buckley. Christmasaccounts for a large part of many retailers' annual profits. Reports ofa buoyant December and good start to the post-Christmas sales havebreathed life back into a sector depressed by gloomy results in theautumn.Three retailers thought to have had the liveliest festive seasons -Argos, Dixons and Next - report next week. Argos should unveil a totalsales increase in double digits for the third Christmas running, whileNext is expected to have at least maintained the 10 per cent increasereported in September. Dixons is forecast to report a 10 per centincrease in like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, overChristmas.Also reporting the same week are Boots and Sears. In the former, strongperformances from Boots the Chemists and Halfords will be tarnishedslightly by sales declines in Do It All, and the Fads/Homestyle homedecorating business. For Sears, total sales are expected to be slightlyup, but like-for-like sales down.The following week, Body Shop, Storehouse and Marks and Spencer areforecast to report sales increases of at least 5 per cent.

BZW Private Equity has also offered a further Pounds15m payment contingent on New Look's performance in the three years toMarch 1998.Mr Gavin Aldred, New Look's director in charge of corporate strategy,said proceeds from the disposal would fund expansion: 'In the 12 monthsto March this year, we will have opened 76 stores in the UK and 10 inFrance, and we aim to continue growing at about 50 outlets a year.'

Last week, the group agreed to sell its Little Chef and HappyEater roadside restaurants, Welcome Break motorway service areas andTravelodge budget hotels to the UK brewing and leisure group. The dealis conditional on the failure of Granada's bid.The document is expected to include a promise to increase annualdividends, which were cut from 9.91p to 7.5p for the year to January 311993 and were last raised five years ago.The document will show that Christie & Co, the property surveyor, hasrevalued the hotels upwards by Pounds 355m to Pounds 3.35bn, just over10 per cent above the last estimate in January 1994 and representingnet asset value per share of 325p. This excludes the stake in the SavoyGroup, which Forte plans to sell.The revaluation was dismissed by Granada, which said if the increasehad been added to assets on July 31 last year, the return on assetswould have fallen from 7.4 to 6.5 per cent. 'Frankly, this looks like abit of an own goal by Forte,' said Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chiefexecutive.Forte paid Pounds 280m to acquire the Meridien chain of 58 hotels fromAir France just over a year ago in order to give it a biggerinternational presence. Of the 26 new projects under consideration, oneis in Manchester and all the others abroad, including Beirut andBangkok.Most will be management contracts, although equity stakes have not beenruled out. Expansion in the US remains a priority.Sir Rocco Forte, chairman, said the main thrust for Meridien would beoverseas. The first year had been spent in integrating the business,and Pounds 14m had been taken from head office costs.'We have only just started,' he said. 'Now we will be much morepro-active.'Today's document will concentrate almost entirely on the hotels, givingdetails of performance. Meridien is expected to have contributed 20 percent to group operating profits.Operating profits from Forte's Exclusive hotels - including theGeorges V in Paris and the Grosvenor House in London - are expected toaccount for 10 per cent of hotel profits, with other London hotelsaccounting for 25 per cent. The Posthouse (including Crest) andHeritage traditional hotels are likely to show contributions of 25 percent and 20 per cent respectively.[London Page 17]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996LONDON BRACES ITSELF FOR A REPO REVOLUTION: AN OPEN MARKET IN SALE ANDREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR UK GOVERNMENT BONDS STARTS TODAY   By RICHARD LAPPER and PHILIP GAWITHDealers in UK government bonds are today braced for one of the biggestchanges in the City since Big Bang 10 years ago.The introduction of an open market in gilt repos, agreements to selland then repurchase government bonds, will allow all participants inthe market to borrow and lend stock, removing the monopoly over suchactivity that a select number of firms have long enjoyed and bringingthe UK market into line with practices in the US and France.The Treasury and Bank of England hope the changes will make it easierfor investors to trade gilts, increasing their attractions to overseasinvestors and ultimately reducing the cost of funding government debt.But in the longer term, the development of repos could also lead tobroader changes in the structure of the UK's short-term money marketsand in the way that the Bank of England manages liquidity.'I'm not saying that repo is going to take off overnight but it is thebrave new world,' says Ms Una van Dorssen, director of repo marketingat NatWest Markets.In simple terms, a repo is an agreement to sell a security and thenrepurchase it at an agreed future price and date.One party to the deal 'borrows' money, using the security as acollateral. The other party 'lends' the money and 'borrows' the bond,in much the same way as a pawnbroker would take temporary possession ofvaluables in return for a personal loan. But although the repo lookslike a loan, in reality it encompasses a disposal and a subsequentacquisition, reducing credit risk in the event of default by eitherparty.And in the international bond markets, repos play a more complexeconomic function. Dealers frequently borrow money through repos tofund the purchases of the same bonds, which are then committed ascollateral. Securities firms usually rely on this means to financetheir operations as they do not have access to the interbank marketswhere banks lend to each other.At the same time, dealers 'lend' money through repo agreements, in asimilar way to how they might place money on deposit with a bank,although in this case they have the additional security of holding abond as collateral. At the same time, the 'borrowed' bonds can be usedto meet short-term trading needs. In the bond markets, dealersfrequently take short positions (sell bonds they do not own), when theyfeel prices are likely to fall.In the UK, the ability to carry out repos or to borrow or lendgovernment stock through stock lending agreements has been restrictedby law to stock exchange money brokers - effectively middlemen. Inaddition, only gilt-edged market-makers, a group of more than 20securities firms licensed by the Bank of England, have been allowed to'short' the market.The new, more liberal rules will make it possible for a much widerrange of traders and investors to operate in the UK gilts market. 'Thefact that it is now seen as a clear and open market will make itattractive. It will encourage people into the marketplace. They nolonger see it as an esoteric market with rules of its own,' says MrDavid Brayshaw, managing director LM Money Brokers.Ms van Dorssen at NatWest Markets says that with a deep and liquidunderlying market and a robust futures market in place, repo'sdevelopment will increase the range of strategies open to traders.The impact of repo on the UK's money markets should also besignificant. 'It will be beneficial for the money market and shouldhelp to restore liquidity,' says Mr Brayshaw. 'There has been a lack ofshort-dated government paper that can be traded. Also, the overnightmarket, which determines funding costs, has come to be dominated by asmall group of players.'Ms Van Dorssen says cash managers will be able to place larger amountsof money on 'a repo line' than on an 'unsecured deposit line'.And in the short term, at least until liquidity in the market picks up,dealers expect repo rates to be close to the London interbank rates,offering investors the double advantage of security and extra yield.Nevertheless, traditional market participants may take time to adapt tothe new environment.Some UK institutions, which currently earn a fee by lending stock ontheir books to money brokers, may have to modify their systems andlearn new skills. Specialists in managing medium and long-terminvestments, they may be less prepared for the demands of short-termmoney market management necessary in the repo market. And dealers mayprefer to obtain finance through existing relationships with moneybrokers.In the long term, however, dealing directly with other dealers andinvestors through repos should become cheaper and more attractive. MrSimon Briscoe, chief UK economist at Nikko Europe, says money marketoperators will respond to repo in a similar way to how Britishmotorists responded to the opening of the motorways in the early 1960s.'It wasn't an immediate transition. Even though motorways allowed formore traffic and bigger lorries people still use the A roads.'Step away from tradition, Page 22[London Page 17]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996INTERNATIONAL COMPANY NEWS:DISNEY AIMS TO PUMP UP THE VOLUME   By ALICE RAWSTHORNWalt Disney, the US entertainment group which recently bid Dollars 19bn(Pounds 12.2bn) for the Capital Cities/ABC television company, plans tostrengthen its presence in the music business.It is believed to have joined forces in the autumn with PolyGram, theworld's largest record company, in an attempt to sign up Janet Jackson,the US singer. Mr Michael Eisner, group chairman, wanted to sign her inthe hope that a high-profile star would raise Disney's stature in themusic market and attract other acts.Under the terms of Disney's agreement with PolyGram, Ms Jackson wouldhave split her recording contract between the two groups. She wouldhave signed to Disney in North America and to A&M, the PolyGramsubsidiary which was her original record label, for the rest of theworld.It now looks as though Janet Jackson will sign a new contract withVirgin Music, the record label to which she has been contracted since1991 when her A&M deal ended. Virgin, owned by Thorn EMI, the UKleisure group, is thought to have out-bid Disney and PolyGram justbefore Christmas, although it has not yet signed a contract with MsJackson.Mr Eisner is still keen for Disney to expand in the music market, whichis one of the fastest growing and most profitable areas of theentertainment industry. Until now the focus of the group's musicinterests has been its Hollywood Records subsidiary founded six yearsago.Hollywood's performance has been erratic. It has released a number ofhighly successful soundtrack albums under the Walt Disney record label.The Lion King, the soundtrack to the 1994 animated hit, has sold morethan 9m copies in the US. But it has failed to become a force in themarketplace.One option for Disney would be to continue to try to attracthigh-profile stars. This could be slow and expensive as there is fiercecompetition among rival labels for best-selling acts. An alternativewould be to bid for EMI Music, the Thorn EMI division that owns Virgin,which is expected to be demerged from the rest of the Thorn EMI groupnext autumn.

The completionof the offer will mean Mediobanca will hold 15.26 per cent of Ferfin,with an estimated disbursement of L582bn (Dollars 367m).Mediobanca finally accepted the ruling of Consob, the stock exchangewatch dog, late last Friday. It had initially lodged an appeal with theregional administrative court of Lazio, and when that failed with thehigher court of the state council.Pricing of the offer presents several problems. Principal among thesehas been the L953bn Ferfin rights issue in mid-December. This came wellafter Consob's first ruling that Mediobanca must make a public offer.Before the rights issue, analysts suggested L1,580 per sharerepresented the average price paid by Mediobanca in its October raid onFerfin.But just before the rights issue they were suspended at L1,056; andConsob announced only shareholders on the register before the issuecould be the subject of Mediobanca's public buy offer.

The twohad listed the ability to grow beyond their Californian base as a keyreason for the combination.Under the terms of the all-stock deal, shareholders in Health Systemswould have received 45 per cent of the shares in the combined group.However, the two sides are believed to have been unable to agree onwhat role the smaller company's managers should play after a merger.The deal would have provided the springboard for a far more widely-heldpublic company than either is at present.[London Page 18]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996INTERNATIONAL COMPANY NEWS:VICTORS AND VICTIMS OF BOARDROOM UPHEAVAL - TIM BURT LOOKS AT THE HIGHNUMBER OF COMPANIES STARTING THE YEAR WITH A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP   By TIM BURTAn unprecedented number of Britain's leading companies are beginning1996 with newly-installed chairmen and chief executives following ayear of boardroom upheaval.Groups such as BAT Industries and Inchcape have new chairmen, whileBritish Telecommunications, BTR, BOC, WH Smith, and electroniccomponents manufacturer Bowthorpe are among those to bring in new chiefexecutives.Their arrival - mostly part of a smooth succession - comes after a yearin which other high-profile directors became boardroom casualties,including Lord Young and Mr James Ross, chairman and chief executiverespectively of Cable & Wireless.Mr Tiny Rowland left Lonrho after losing his long-running battle withMr Dieter Bock, the trading group's chief executive. Other departuresincluded Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential; Mr RichardReynolds, a director of GEC; Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive atCalor Group; and Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley.Russell Reynolds, the UK's largest headhunter in revenue terms, saidthe number of arrivals and departures reflected the growing influenceof institutional shareholders and non-executive directors in bringingin new management.'We're seeing a trend that when companies are having a very difficulttime the executives are being brought to account,' said Mr DavidShellard, managing director.He cited the Cadbury committee on corporate governance as one factorbehind the increased turnover among company directors, while addingthat the Greenbury committee on executive remuneration had focusedshareholder attention on performance-related pay.Heidrick & Struggles International, the London-based executiverecruitment agency, said the rash of outside appointments alsosignalled a growing skills shortage at board level. Mr John Viney,chairman, said: 'There are simply too few people to go round. So we'reseeing the best, such as Sir Colin Marshall, taking on two or threeroles.'Sir Colin, chairman of British Airways, yesterday became non-executivechairman of Inchcape, the international marketing and services group.'Inchcape has not been in the best of health,' Mr Viney added. 'Theyknow it's much better to have a top-class person - even if only for oneday a week - than someone less effective,'Among the other new arrivals this month, Lord Cairns, who last yearresigned as chief executive of SG Warburg, the investment bank, becomeschairman of BAT Industries.Mr Ian Strachan succeeds Mr Alan Jackson as chief executive of BTR. SirPeter Bonfield, knighted in the New Year honours, moves from computergroup ICL to be chief executive of BT. Mr Bill Cockburn has becomechief executive at WH Smith.Mr Tim Parker is taking over as chief executive at CJ Clark, theshoemakers. Mr Nicholas Brookes is the new chief executive atBowthorpe.

The unittrust operation will sell two unit trusts - a UK growth fund and abalanced fund which includes an element of overseas exposure.Apart from the policies it designs itself, Nationwide Life will alsosell a permanent health insurance policy bought in from PPP, thehealthcare company.This is a smaller and simpler range than the Guardian policies whichNationwide has been offering, but Mr Boardman said the straightforwardnature of the products should help to keep costs down. He believed therange was still broad enough to meet most customers' needs.For Nationwide, as for other mortgage lenders which have set up theirown financial services businesses, a key element will be to marketthese products to the entire customer base - savers as well asborrowers.Initially, Nationwide's salaried financial services sales force will bemade up of about 340 agents and will grow to 380 by the end ofFebruary. Just over half of these will be branch-based, with theremainder available to visit customers.[London Page 18]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996INTERNATIONAL COMPANY NEWS:FRENCH BANK SEEKS SHORT-TERM FINANCE   By ANDREW JACK   PARISCredit Foncier de France, the specialist French property bank, isconsidering obtaining a substantial short-term bridging loan while itundertakes a wide-ranging restructuring plan.Bank executives are believed to be discussing the idea of seeking aloan from a commercial bank, secured on its assets, which would lastabout three years.Separately, they are holding talks with the government about short-termways to stave off the growing financial crisis triggered by thewithdrawal of its monopoly rights over certain state-backed housingloan schemes.The idea is to provide the bank with time to introduce a restructuringprogramme which could reduce costs by 30 to 40 per cent in as little asthe next two years, including job cuts and the possible sale of some ofits central Paris offices.However, executives want to reduce staffing without any redundancies sothey are likely to extend the length of their programme to at leastthree years.They are also discussing refocusing the bank, possibly by withdrawingfrom activities such as loans to property developers and localauthorities, and concentrating on core activities of loans to low andmiddle-income housing projects.Credit Foncier's ability to raise funds on the capital markets has beentightly restricted recently because its share price has dropped sharplyand its credit rating has fallen.It was dealt a severe blow during December when the French stock marketregulators recommended against it proceeding with a proposed mergerwith its 55 per cent-owned subsidiary, Societe des Immeubles de France.The deal would have provided a much-needed FFr1bn (Dollars 204m) boostto its balance sheet. It is now looking at other ways of achieving arecapitalisation.The bank is also likely to discuss with the French government, in themedium-term, a change to its legal statutes to make it more like itsprivate sector competitors.Although it is a quoted company without any state shareholding, thegovernment appoints its chairman or 'governor'.[London Page 18]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996INTERNATIONAL COMPANY NEWS:HYUNDAI TO ACCELERATE DECENTRALISATION - SOUTH KOREA'S BIGGESTFAMILY-RUN 'CHAEBOL' IS MOVING WITH THE TIMES   By JOHN BURTONMr Chung Mong-koo, Hyundai's new chairman, is likely to preside overthe gradual break-up of the giant family-owned South Korean industrialgroup his father established in 1947.That, however, is the way Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, wantsit. In an attempt to avoid a family fight over the Hyundai empire afterhis death, Mr Chung decided several years ago to divide it amongseveral of his sons and nephews by transferring his stock in most ofHyundai's 45 companies to them.The result has been the creation of smaller and decentralised groupswithin Hyundai that amount to a confederation of allied companies.The process is expected to accelerate with the recent formal transferof management control from the elder Mr Chung and his brother ChungSe-yung, who succeeded him as chairman in 1987, to their sons.Hyundai's restructuring, which is expected to benefit the group, couldserve as an example to Korea's other conglomerates, or chaebol. Thechaebol have been widely criticised for being too big and inefficientwhile fierce competition, for example, has led to duplication ofactivity.Government officials have long urged them to abandon many of theirmarginal businesses and concentrate on a few specialised industrialsectors to improve their global competitiveness.Splitting Hyundai into smaller groups is expected to help achieve thesegoals. Each mini-Hyundai group focuses on only a few industries, andthese units are less able to support unprofitable activities than theywere within the old monolithic structure.Under a reorganisation plan announced a year ago, Hyundai was dividedinto six main groups, with almost all now controlled by one of MrChung's sons and nephews.The most ambitious of the new sub-groups is the one controlled by MrChung Mong-koo, the new Hyundai chairman and eldest surviving son ofthe Hyundai founder.In 1977, he established Hyundai Precision & Industry as a cargocontainer company, which became the world's largest. Hyundai Precisionnow produces railway engines and carriages, sports and utilityvehicles, and military equipment. It also plans to enter the aerospacesector, assembling aircraft and satellites.Mong-koo also controls Hyundai's small steel operations, which he wantsto expand by building a large mill that would supply steel to Hyundai'scar and shipbuilding operations.Mr Chung Mong-hun, his brother and the new Hyundai vice-chairman, hasdeveloped Hyundai Electronics into one of the world's biggest producersof computer memory chips in less than a decade. Another brother, MrChung Mong-jun, controls Hyundai's shipbuilding operations, the biggestin Korea.Hyundai Motors, Korea's largest car company and considered the group'scrown jewel, is being taken over by the family of Mr Chung Se-yung, thebrother of the Hyundai founder. His only son, Mong-kyu, has beenappointed as the car company's new chairman at the age of 33.Mr Chung Mong-hyuk, another nephew of the Hyundai founder, has beennamed new president of Hyundai's petrochemical and oil refiningcompanies, another growth area.Other main Hyundai companies, including its trading house andconstruction company, remain under the control of the group founder.A formal break-up of Hyundai is likely to take some time since thegroup is held together by a complex web of cross-holdings. These ties,however, should weaken as the government imposes limits oncross-holding arrangements in attempt to reduce the economic dominanceof the chaebol.Family solidarity is also expected to prevent an early break-up ofHyundai. The Hyundai companies are likely to operate on the same basisthat Mr Chung Ju-yung has established with several of his brothers, whohave created their own small industrial groups that partly depend onHyundai for business.Hyundai Motors, for example, is the biggest customer for the motorvehicle parts company of the Halla group, founded by Mr Chung In-yung.Nonetheless, internal conflict may also increase as rivalry growsbetween the Hyundai companies. Hyundai Precision, for example, ischallenging Hyundai Motors by producing four-wheel drive vehicles andmini-vans.A looser organisational structure may also make it more difficult topush through large projects that were once easily tackled under theautocratic management style of the Hyundai founder.Analysts will also be watching closely to see whether the new Hyundaichairman can gain group support for his projected Dollars 10bn steelmill, which has been criticised by some Hyundai subsidiaries asunnecessary.                          *       *      *Companies affiliated with relatives of Chung Ju-yungChung Mong-koo, eldest son, chairman of Hyundai group.

It floated at Dollars22 just after the film's opening at Thanksgiving, and quickly reached ahigh of Dollars 49 1/2, although by year-end it had fallen back toaround Dollars 28 7/8.Many of the new issues were in the technology sector, which had led themarket higher for much of the year, although towards the end of theyear many of these stocks faltered as growth in semiconductor salesslowed.The technology sector's performance should not obscure notable gains inother sectors. Lower interest rates and hopes for productivity gainsmade bank and insurance company shares among the best performers.Banks, deep into a round of mergers, recorded gains of more than 50 percent.Steel companies, most of which crawled back into profit only in 1994,managed the dubious distinction of forming the worst-performing stockmarket sector.Another poor performer was the retail sector, which ended anotherdifficult year with a disappointing Christmas.CONSTRUCTION FALLSBuilding sites abound in German cities and cranes cover the Frankfurtskyline, but construction shares headed remorselessly downwards in1995, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. The sector's share performanceslumped by 33 per cent and 1996 is not expected to show much, if any,improvement.By contrast, the electrical and electronics sector had a strong year,adding 34 per cent. Apart from Siemens, reaping the benefits of itsaggressively profit-oriented restructuring, the sector contains SAP,the fast-growing producer of business software. SAP's share performancehas been meteoric in the past two years, though it has slowed recently.Commerzbank, whose own new headquarters is taking shape in Frankfurt,estimates that profits of quoted construction companies will rise amere 2 per cent in 1996 after 6 per cent in 1995. The German commercialand homes building boom is now over, with public sector constructionalso held back by budget constraints.Mr Ingo Mainert, a Commerzbank analyst, says stocks likely to performin line with or better than the overall market this year includemotors, steel, electricals and electronics, and insurance.The bank foresees the DAX index rising to 2,500 or even 2,600 pointsafter it closed on Friday at 2,254, a rise of 7 per cent on the year. Ayear ago, the bank had hoped for 2,400 but the weak dollar and higherthan expected pay rises threw out its calculations.For electrical and electronics companies, Commerzbank expects anoverall profits rise of 21 per cent this year after 22 per cent in1995. Earnings in the steel, engineering, motor and metal industriesshould show steeper rises, it says.Further markets will be coveredover the following days.[London Page 18]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996INTERNATIONAL COMPANY NEWS:THOMAS LOCKER'S BID FOR PENTRE ATTACKED   By TIM BURTThe largest shareholder in Thomas Locker yesterday claimed theengineering group was seeking a reverse takeover with its proposedPounds 7.5m bid for Pentre, the industrial drums manufacturer.Mr John Carr, who holds 22.6 per cent of Thomas Locker's ordinaryshares, said the purchase price overvalued Pentre: 'The shareholders ofThomas Locker not only get no premium for the very significant valueinherent in the company they own, they are being asked to approve ascheme that will lose them control.'Mr Carr, who acquired his stake in the company last May, urgedshareholders to reject the acquisition, which is being funded by theissue of 8.62m new and 25.9m A ordinary shares.

At 296,425 tonnes they were more thandouble the July low.With further rises in stocks expected, analysts and traders werepredicting further falls this week.

It revives anissue which some might have thought buried: the power of themultinationals. It is also a useful reminder that the triumph of freetrade - an idea implicit in most investment strategies today - cannotbe taken for granted.The opening salvo came in a review by the political theorist Mr FrancisFukuyama of a book called Opposing The System. The book, by a veteranleftist Mr Charles Reich, reportedly argues that the current socialmalaise - poverty, unemployment and so forth - has been engineered bylarge corporations for their own benefit. Therefore, it says, thepowers of government should be increased to control them.Mr Fukuyama regarded this as 1960s claptrap. The remedies proposed byMr Reich, he argued, had got us into this mess in the first place.Poverty and crime were caused not by big companies, but by biggovernment.Enter stage left another 1960s veteran, the consumers' champion MrRalph Nader. Big corporations, he wrote in reply, erode democracy,export jobs, and weaken the legal safeguards for workers, consumers andthe environment. 'Until Mr Fukuyama understands that a society rotsfrom the head down and that corporate power needs analysis, he willnever understand Mr Reich's thesis,' he concluded.So far, so familiar. But the role of the multinationals is becomingpart of a wider issue: that of free trade. If you believe that freetrade is destroying jobs and damaging society, you are bound to blamethe multinationals as its agents.As another book recently put it, global free trade 'will impoverish anddestabilise the industrialised world, while at the same time cruellyravaging the third world.' The author is no 1960s leftist, but theerstwhile corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith.As a blend of right-wing populist and born-again environmentalist, SirJames forms an unlikely bridge between the two wings of protectionism.On the right, he is joined by the US presidential candidate Mr PatBuchanan and by the fellow-billionaire Mr Ross Perot.On the left, he links with those who argue that free trade enables badenvironmental practice to drive out good: that through the agency -again - of the multinationals, production will gravitate to countriesfree from costly environmental controls.Those who feel paranoid about the unholy alliance of free-tradegovernments and big business can point to one central fact. As thechart reminds us, world trade has indeed been growing rapidly inrelation to the world economy since the late 1980s, having previouslygrown in line.But are corporations growing in proportion? The evidence is mixed. Lastyear, the three biggest US companies by revenues, as listed by Fortunemagazine, were General Motors, Ford and Exxon. Their combined sales ofDollars 384bn (Pounds 249.3bn) were equal to 5.7 per cent of US GDP.The figure for the same trio 20 years before was 6.7 per cent.But if US multinationals are not bigger, they may still be morepowerful. Arguably, modern communications and the lowering of tradebarriers give them much more opportunity to arbitrage labour andcapital around the world. Hence the solution of such as Mr Buchanan:put the barriers up again.It might be thought that the impulse to free trade is politicallyunstoppable: and indeed, that in the coming world of the Internet thegenie cannot be put back in the bottle anyway.Not everyone in the investment community agrees. The highly successfulinvestor Mr George Soros, for instance, argues that electronic trade isnot intrinsically different from the old kind, just faster. It would beperfectly feasible to re-impose exchange controls, he says. Singlecountries could not do it, but groups of countries could.Mr Soros is gloomily convinced that the present world order, which heregards as a golden age of capitalism, will ultimately break down. Thelast comparable period, he says, was the end of the 19th century. Inthose days, 'the British Empire was at the heart of the system, and hadan interest in maintaining security. When there was trouble, it sent agunboat. Now there is no chief beneficiary (from stability): certainlynot the US.'Should the average investor worry about all this? Not for the timebeing, perhaps. Both of the likely protagonists in next year's USpresidential elections, Mr Clinton and Mr Robert Dole, are professedfree traders: although both will bear watching for signs of concessionsto their respective outer wings.The point is rather that the case for a prolonged global bull marketcontains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, we are told thatmultinational corporations are enjoying a one-off shift to greaterproductivity and cheaper labour, based largely on the globalisation ofmarkets. On the other, we are told the globalising process does notentail empoverishing one set of workers to the benefit of another. Freetrade means faster growth, so the pie gets bigger.This worked very well for small countries like Taiwan and Korea, whichwere able to develop and open up at their own pace. It is anothermatter, to paraphrase Sir James Goldsmith, when political upheaval,modern communications and the liberalisation of capital movements hurl4bn workers into the world economy in the space of a few years.Hence the internal contradiction. Proponents of the bull market arguethat the shift in power between capital and labour is profound enoughto last for a generation. The question is what that generation willmake of it. If it feels disposed to rebel, global free trade could bethe first casualty.-----------------------------------------------------------------------               TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 28/12/95-----------------------------------------------------------------------                               % change over period                     US   Japan   Germany   France   Italy     UK-----------------------------------------------------------------------Cash-----------------------------------------------------------------------Week               0.11    0.01     0.08     0.10     0.20   0.12Month              0.48    0.04     0.33     0.46     0.88   0.57Year               7.50    2.63     5.81     6.94    10.44   7.75-----------------------------------------------------------------------Bonds 3-5 year-----------------------------------------------------------------------Week               0.12   -0.44    -0.12     0.01     0.59  -0.26Month              0.97   -0.23     1.31     1.15     2.26   1.49Year              15.02   12.67    15.28    14.48    16.80  14.31-----------------------------------------------------------------------Bonds 7-10 year-----------------------------------------------------------------------Week               0.05   -0.47    -0.25    -0.04     1.06  -0.79Month              1.54    0.53     2.08     1.93     3.88   1.89Year              21.12   16.50    17.84    17.69    19.19  15.78-----------------------------------------------------------------------Equities-----------------------------------------------------------------------Week                0.7     0.5      0.8      2.4      3.3    1.2Month               1.0     6.7      2.8      0.1      6.7    1.2Year               36.4     3.1      8.5      2.1     -1.8   22.7-----------------------------------------------------------------------Source: Cash & Bonds - Lehman Brothers.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Equities - NatWest Securities.

But turning avaguely expressed enthusiasm for low inflation into a precise numericalobjective is not as straightforward as it sounds.For one thing, policymakers face a trade-off between the need toestablish credibility and to demonstrate humility. Any target has to bedemanding enough to persuade people that the authorities are seriousabout achieving low inflation; but it cannot be too demanding becausecredibility will then be lost again when the target proves impossibleto hit.In 1992 Britain adopted a formal inflation target comprising threeobjectives: underlying inflation between 1 and 4 per cent until spring1997; between 1 and 2.5 per cent in spring 1997; and below 2 per centin the long term. The most demanding element soon slipped from publicconsciousness, but the first two stayed in place. By last summer,however, the remaining target had to be updated. Interest rate changestake about two years to affect prices, so it was becoming too late todo much about inflation within the target period.Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced therefore in his MansionHouse speech that he would aim for underlying inflation of 2.5 per centor less beyond spring 1997. He predicted this would keep inflationbetween 1 and 4 per cent most of the time, recognising that unexpectedevents might push inflation higher when it was too late forpolicymakers to react.This formulation has caused confusion ever since and influential voiceshave argued that it needs rewriting again. Sir Terry Burns, thepermanent secretary to the Treasury, said shortly before Christmas thatthe government should move away from targeting a range for inflation,concentrating instead on a single figure. Some senior officials at theBank of England agree.The Mansion House speech left many questions unanswered in the minds ofCity and academic economists. Was the new target looser or tighter thanits predecessor? Was the inflation objective 1 to 2.5 per cent, 1 to 4per cent or 2.5 per cent and below?The conduct of interest rate policy in subsequent months only deepenedthe mystery. Mr Eddie George had told the chancellor in May thatinflation was set to exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time and that heshould therefore raise rates. The chancellor refused because he thoughtinflation would be lower. Economists were unnerved by the disagreement,but at least both sides appeared to agree on the definition of thetarget - 2.5 per cent or below.But in September the Bank muddied the waters. It continued to predictthat inflation would exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time, butdropped its demand for a rate rise. Shortly afterwards, Mr Mervyn King,its chief economist, argued that the target would be satisfied ifinflation averaged 2.5 per cent or less over a long period. Toobservers who had thought the authorities were supposed to be erring onthe side of caution - keeping inflation below 2.5 per cent except inunavoidable circumstances - this looked like a loosening of policy.But in a sense it was simply a recognition of the inevitablelimitations of inflation targeting. These limitations were demonstratedby Andrew Haldane and Christopher Salmon, from the Bank, in a studypublished last month*. They constructed a model of British inflationsince 1960 and reran history as though the authorities had pursued a2.5 per cent inflation target by setting interest rates on the basis ofa forward-looking forecast.The study suggested inflation would have been lower and less variablehad the authorities followed this policy, as the graphic illustrates.But Haldane and Salmon also used the model to assess the possibleoutcomes for inflation had the economy been buffeted by the whole rangeof unforecastable outside disturbances which was typical of the period.They concluded that even if monetary policy had always been welldirected, the authorities would have had only a one-in-four chance ofhitting a 1 to 4 per cent inflation target: 'Other things equal, theseresults would argue for an inflation target band width at least as wideas that operating in the UK - and possibly much wider.'This study provides further evidence that it may be counter-productiveto express the inflation target as a range at all - be it 1 to 4 percent or 2.5 per cent and below. If the range were wide enough for evena well-intentioned policymaker to be confident of hitting the target,it would have to be so wide as to provide little gain in credibility.Finland has recognised this problem and aims simply for inflation of 2per cent. The Bank of Finland concedes that it would be impossible tohit the target precisely in any given month, except by chance. But itargues nonetheless that a single figure provides a better anchor forprivate-sector expectations than a target range.Mr King's comments and the Bank of England's advice this autumn suggestthat the authorities in the UK may be behaving as though they have apoint target for inflation slightly below 2.5 per cent - even thoughthat is not what the formal statement of the target says. If so, thechancellor would do well to rewrite his target again so that itreflects reality in a rather clearer way.Targeting Inflation, Bank of England, 1995[London Page 19]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EMERGING MARKETS: THAILAND - NEWS ROUND-UPThe average daily turnover on the Bangkok stock exchange in 1995 fellby 27.5 per cent from Bt8.6bn to Bt6.25bbn.Foreign trading on the SET over that period was Bt804.36bn, accountingfor 26.35 per cent of total trade.Foreign buying was worth Bt425.3bn in the period, while sellingaccounted for Bt379.03bn.[London Page 20]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EMERGING MARKETS: HONG KONG - NEWS ROUND-UPThe Hong Kong stock exchange will review regulations on options tradingin the first quarter of 1996 and does not expect to launch new optionsduring the review period.The review would cover the proposal that market makers should be exemptfrom stamp duty when they conducted arbitrage with the spot market tospread risks.The exchange will also study changes to rules governing opening bidsand how to increase the number of market participants, including marketmakersThe exchange began listing individual stock options in September andcurrently trades options on nine stocks.[London Page 20]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EMERGING MARKETS: INDONESIA - NEWS ROUND-UPFurther state asset sales, an updated legal framework and automationcould mean a bright start to the year for the Jakarta stock exchange,brokers and analysts believe.The exchange switched to a fully automated trading system from manualoperations in May, after long delays.

Last year was much better than the dismalspectacle of 1994, but the last few months were characterised by the USdollar trading in a very narrow range.There is a fair amount of bullishness among currency forecasters aboutthe outlook for the dollar, though in recent years it has managed toconfound the best intended explanations for why it should rally.Analysts at Lehman Brothers think that the dollar stands to benefit inthe coming months from: perceptions that inflation has becomestructurally lower, a modest improvement in the current account deficitas a proportion of GDP, and resolution of the budget negotiations.They caution, though, that any rally could run into the buffers in thesecond half of the year, which may be dominated by a turn-round inGerman interest rate expectations.Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the dollar,forecasting levels of DM1.55 and Y112 in the next six months. Againstthe yen, their thinking is based upon trends in the trade and currentaccount data of both the US and Japan, which suggest that the bigbilateral balances between the countries are turning in the dollar'sfavour.Against the D-Mark, their thinking departs from the premise that theGerman economy is suffering from the mis-alignment of the D-Mark inEurope, and this will require the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy inorder to curb D-Mark strength.Politics will be a key variable. US presidential elections will affectthe dollar, while the progress towards monetary union in Europe willalso be an important determinant of D-Mark and Swiss franc performance.The proximity of elections in the UK, and a possible Labour government,could make life difficult for sterling.[London Page 20]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EMERGING MARKETS:LOOKING AHEAD TO BRIGHTER PROSPECTS - THE EMERGING INVESTOR   By JOHN PITTThe year just ended has not been one that investors in the world'semerging equity markets will care to remember. Far better to look aheadto the brighter prospects that many strategists believe beckon in 1996.But there were some winners during 1995 - a year in which what havebecome known as the 'pre-emerging' markets came into their own.Take Jordan, for example, capitalised at less than Dollars 5bn (comparethis with Mexico's market capitalisation of about Dollars 90bn), and anannual turnover estimated at less than Dollars 1bn. (Mexico has anaverage daily turnover of at least Dollars 100m.)A far sighted investor who took a position in the country's fledglingstock market at the start of last year would have seendollar-denominated assets appreciate by 23 per cent. Compare this witha loss of 35 per cent in both India and Hungary, or 40 per cent in SriLanka.Certainly one of the prominent themes of 1995 has been the growinginterest in these pre-emerging markets: countries which are justbeginning to organise their financial structures, but are endeavouringto do so as quickly as possible.As the main emerging markets of Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey,for example, retreated in the face of a flow of funds back into thedeveloped world, so interest turned to lesser known regions. Inparticular, a race began among a number of US and European investmentbanks and brokerages to establish contacts and trading positions inAfrica. It became clear that in this 'new scramble for Africa' returnson investments could, in many cases, far exceed those in the moremature markets. But the risk would also be much greater.This did not deter the launch of a number of African funds during 1995,although most were naturally skewed towards the largest market on thecontinent - South Africa. With an estimated market capitalisation ofDollars 274bn Johannesburg is the world's seventh largest stockexchange.Russia was another growth area and some commentators believe that 1996will see this market come of age, especially after the presidentialelection is out of the way. ING Barings global strategy unit led byMichael Howell, for instance, believes that both eastern Europe andRussia show attractive valuation levels, and thinks fund managers areready to significantly increase their exposure.'Of the Dollars 50bn expected to flow towards emerging equity marketsin 1996, I expect some Dollars 5bn to head towards eastern Europe andRussia,' says Mr Howell. 'This is equivalent to more than 10 per centof existing market capitalisation, and, perhaps, as much as 25 per centof the existing free-float.'Other factors likely to lift investor sentiment in Russia include animprovement in custodial operations, with expectations that anindependent central depository will finally be created.Mr Mark Mobius, president of the Dollars 7bn Templeton Emerging MarketsFund, is another enthusiast for Russia, although he is aware that thecountry's turbulent political climate is likely to get worse before itgets any better.Nevertheless, he is confident that potential for investment is bright,given that the country has embarked on what he calls a 'revolutionary'approach to financial market reforms.But what of the core emerging markets?Mr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign & ColonialEmerging Markets based in London, believes that in spite of adisappointing return on investments in 1995 the outlook remainspositive. He picks South Korea, India, Brazil and Taiwan, among others,as having strong prospects.India, for example, continues to have good compound earnings growth, hesays.He is also among a number of strategists who favour Brazil among LatinAmerican markets.Garantia, a leading Brazilian investment bank, warns that slowereconomic growth during the first half of the year will put a brake onthe stock market's momentum; while for the year as a whole it will bevery much a matter of selecting specific sectors. Garantia favours thefood, beverage, packaging and retail sectors, on the basis that therecent decline in inflation means that many people now have adisposable income for the first time in years.At UBS the emerging markets team is keen on Chile, South Korea andTurkey, all for different reasons. Chile will continue to see animprovement in the economic picture and political problems are forecastto dissipate; South Korea is expected to benefit from an easing inmonetary policy; and Turkey should be able to move forward once againnow that the parliamentary elections are out of the way.Chile will also benefit from the increased weighting - from 1.9 percent to 7.3 per cent - which the equity market will attract in theIFC's investable index which starts this month. Mr Nigel Rendell atJames Capel, who classifies Chile as 'an Asian tiger living in LatinAmerica', forecasts that despite the recent rise in interest rates,corporate earnings will rise by 25 per cent in nominal terms, valuingthe market on a prospective p/e of 16 times.Whether or not this year will see a pick-up in activity among theworld's emerging markets depends on a host of factors, not least themovement in US interest rates. Further easing in US monetary policy,many analysts believe, could trigger a fresh wave of institutionalmoney out of the US and Europe, and into Latin America and the FarEast.[London Page 20]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EMERGING MARKETS: ING BARING SECURITIES EMERGING MARKETS INDICES-----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Week on week movementIndex                     29/12/95         Actual     Percent-----------------------------------------------------------------------World (301)                 147.56          -0.47      -0.32Latin AmericaArgentina (20)               92.78          -0.14      -0.15Brazil (21)                 186.09          +2.03      +1.10Chile (12)                  195.67          -3.52      -1.77Mexico (25)                  73.59          -2.31      -3.04Peru (17)                  1068.95         +27.09      +2.60Latin America (95)          123.14          -0.65      -0.52EuropeGreece (16)                  97.97          +1.89      +1.97Portugal (18)               116.46          +0.55      +0.47Turkey (21)                  82.80          -7.41      -8.22Europe (55)                 121.53          -0.85      -0.70AsiaIndonesia (26)              138.64          -1.53      -1.09Korea (23)                  136.90          -1.12      -0.81Malaysia (23)               227.37          -0.26      -0.12Pakistan (11)                73.59          +1.54      +2.14Phillippines (11)           259.16          +4.54      +1.78Thailand (25)               251.89          -2.19      -0.86Taiwan (32)                 130.82          +2.14      +1.66Asia (151)                  203.04          +0.12      +0.06-----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Month on month movement    Year to date movementIndex                 Actual      Percent        Actual      Percent-----------------------------------------------------------------------World (301)           +7.78        +5.57         -10.47       -6.63Latin AmericaArgentina (20)       +11.73       +14.47          +6.67       +7.74Brazil (21)          +10.86        +6.20         -23.28      -11.12Chile (12)           +16.82        +9.41         -15.90       -7.52Mexico (25)           +1.79        +2.49         -24.03      -24.62Peru (17)            +65.34        +6.51        +220.28      +25.96Latin America (95)    +7.87        +6.83         -15.63      -11.26EuropeGreece (16)           +4.20        +4.48         +10.98      +12.62Portugal (18)         +1.30        +1.13          +0.18       +0.15Turkey (21)           -1.31        -1.56          +6.69       +8.79Europe (55)           +5.14        +4.42         +23.84      +24.40AsiaIndonesia (26)        +5.10        +3.82          +4.96       +3.71Korea (23)            -7.79        -5.38          -2.98       -2.13Malaysia (23)        +10.63        +4.90         +16.51       +7.83Pakistan (11)        +10.10       +15.90         -32.61      -30.70Phillippines (11)    +17.63        +7.30         -22.96       -8.14Thailand (25)        +16.41        +6.97          +0.24       +0.10Taiwan (32)          +12.00       +10.10         -53.33      -28.96Asia (151)            +9.38        +4.84          -7.57       -3.60-----------------------------------------------------------------------All indices in Dollars terms, January 7th 1992=100.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Source: ING Baring Securities-----------------------------------------------------------------------[London Page 20]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EQUITY MARKETS:INVESTORS FACE A DEARTH OF ECONOMIC DATA - NEW YORK   By RICHARD WATERSThanks to the latest Federal government shutdown, US stock marketinvestors start the new year facing a dearth of official economic dataagainst which to judge the economy's performance.The only significant new information this week will be the NationalAssociation of Purchasing Management report for December, due today.The headline NAPM index for the month is expected by most economists tobe around 47.5 - higher than November's 46.5 but still below the50-mark which would point to expectations of manufacturing growth. Thatwould provide a firm backdrop for the bond market, whose recent gainshave underpinned share prices.While keeping one eye on bonds, the stock market will begin to fix itsattention on the corporate earnings season starting later this month.Three months ago, a generally strong set of quarterly results helpedset the stage for the stock market's fourth-quarter rise. This timearound, the figures will be pored over for signs of how the US'seconomic slowdown is affecting earnings growth.Most market followers expect earnings growth to taper off during 1996.But corporate cost-cutting and share repurchases have left plenty ofroom for earnings to come in ahead of expectations. And with USinvestors still buying mutual funds, there seems to be plenty of casharound to chase share prices higher.[London Page 21]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EQUITY MARKETS: STRATEGY - OTHER MARKETSThe start of the new year has brought the usual crop of recommendationsfrom brokers.

It is taking profits on a previous upgrade of the Swiss marketand switching the money into Italy, which it believes is discountingthe bad news and could react positively to a relaxation of monetarypolicy.Morgan says the low valuation on its forecasts and scope for interestrate cuts makes the Swedish market look attractive after its recentunderperformance.Lehman Brothers still recommends being overweight in the Spanish,French, Swedish and Dutch markets. It says the first two are cheap,relative to debt, while slower French growth has been more thandiscounted by the market.Sweden looks attractive on a prospective dividend basis, while theDutch market is the cheapest among the core European economies.The UK, Swiss and Italian markets remained relatively expensive.Liquidity flows had helped the first two, but value would come through.In spite of its underperformance, Lehman saw little value in Italy.ABN-Amro Hoare Govett, meanwhile, continues to prefer Germany and theNetherlands in core Europe while Spain is its peripheral market ofchoice.

A base rate cut in December, accompanied by reductions inEuropean and US interest rates, creates a positive background forequities.With most observers expecting base rates to fall further in the earlymonths of 1996, shares could yet set some more all-time highs. Whilethe FT-SE 100 index did well in 1995, it still lagged well behind WallStreet's phenomenal performance.The first test of the year will be the spring results season, not somuch for the figures themselves, but for chairmen's statements abouttrading conditions in early 1996. The market shrugged off some profitswarnings in late 1995, mainly on the hope that UK economic growth waspausing for breath, rather than grinding to a halt.As the year moves on, thoughts will inevitably turn to the date of anelection, and the chances of a Labour government.Concern will probably focus, not on macro-economic policies, but onmicro-economic matters such as the minimum wage or dividend taxation.If Labour maintains its strong lead in the opinion polls, shares maystart to come under pressure.Much went right for the UK stock market in 1995 - takeover activity, astrong Wall Street, falling bond yields and worldwide interest rates.It will be a surprise if all those factors are still as positive in1996.[London Page 21]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EQUITY MARKETS:CVRD MANDATE SUGGESTS END OF THE GOLDEN 3% FEE - INTERNATIONAL OFFERINGS   By ANTONIA SHARPEThe debate about fees which investment banks charge for arranginginternational equity offerings is set to be a lively one in 1996,judging from the aggressive bids which emerged in the recentcompetition to win Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) mandate.Shortly before Christmas, the Brazilian government said it had chosen aconsortium including Merrill Lynch, NM Rothschild, KPMG and fourBrazilian partners to handle the sale of its 51 per cent stake in CVRD,one of the world's largest exporters of iron ore.The winning consortium is charging a fee of 1.9 per cent to arrangewhat is expected to be one of the most significant international equityofferings of 1996. According to market valuations, the government'sstake is worth about Dollars 5bn but the sale is likely to be spreadover at least two offerings.If the winners' fee looked low, it was by no means the lowest. Bankersinvolved in the bidding said a consortium led by Lehman Brothers hadoffered to do the business for a fee of 1.75 per cent and anotherincluding CS First Boston for 1.9 per cent.It is also believed the fee bid by the consortium including MorganStanley and SBC Warburg (disqualified because the first part of its feeestimate was too far below the average) was in this region.By contrast, Goldman Sachs, which had come top in the technical part ofthe bidding contest, had bid a fee of 3.125 per cent, bankers said.Bankers involved in the consortium which won the CVRD mandate say thelevel of the fee was justified because the sale will be a secondaryoffering and not an initial public offering, which usually commands ahigher fee.Half of the CVRD stock is already traded, making CVRD the mostwidely-held stock after Telebras and Petrobras. As a result, it alreadyhas a wide following among foreign analysts and investors.They also point out that there is a history of low fees in Brazil,where past international equity offerings have been done for fees ofjust over 2 per cent. But the two most important reasons bankers giveto justify the fee are: first, the size of the offering; and second,the importance of being involved in the first of many privatisations inBrazil.Although bankers do not expect the government to sell its CVRD holdingin one go, the arranging banks stand to earn close to Dollars 100m fromthe whole process.On the second point, the bidding highlighted the willingness amonginternational banks to drop their fees in order to be at the forefrontof Brazil's privatisation programme.The government wants CVRD to pave the way for further sell-offs in thecountry's electricity and telecommunications sectors over the next fewyears.The fact that three leading investment banks were willing to arrangethe CVRD sale for a fee of less than 2 per cent, despite the risksassociated with an emerging market such as Brazil, is also a reflectionof the increasingly intense competition in the international equitymarket.Once one of the most lucrative sectors of investment banking, fees forarranging deals, particularly privatisations, have been erodingsteadily over the past two years.This has come about as governments seek to maximise the proceeds ofselling off state assets and new players try to break into the market.The downward pressure on fees has been mainly on privatisations, wherethere is likely to be follow-on business for the banks, and less so oncorporate IPOs or secondary offerings. However, there are signs thatcorporate fees are also coming under pressure.In view of the ever-greater number of privatisations in Europe andelsewhere in the world and the growing number of investment bankswanting a slice of the action, it is inevitable that fee levels havebecome one of the main bargaining tools.With competition set to stiffen further, many bankers now believe thegolden 3 per cent level, once the norm for European privatisations, hasgone for good.-----------------------------------------------------------------------                TOP INTERNATIONAL EQUITY BOOK RUNNERS-----------------------------------------------------------------------                               1995                        1994-----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Dol-                       Dol-                     lars                       larsManager               bn   Rank    %    Issues   bn   Rank     % Issues-----------------------------------------------------------------------Goldman Sachs        5.83    1   13.44    52    6.32    1   11.32   44Morgan Stanley       4.33    2   10.00    37    3.17    3    5.68   44Merrill Lynch        3.17    3    7.30    38    5.43    2    9.72   57SBC Warburg          3.00    4    6.92    27    3.05    4    5.46   20CSFB/Credit Suisse   2.51    5    5.79    18    2.64    7    4.73   31Dresdner-Kleinwort   2.47    6    5.70    12    1.76   10    3.15    8UBS                  1.75    7    4.03    11    0.45   29    0.81    4ABN-Amro HG          1.66    8    3.83     7    1.53   12    2.75    8BZW                  1.65    9    3.81     8    1.60   11    2.86   18Lehman Brothers      1.44   10    3.33    21    2.79    5    4.99   33Industry totals     43.36          100   342   55.88          100  449-----------------------------------------------------------------------Excluding funds and block trades.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Source: Euromoney Bondware-----------------------------------------------------------------------[London Page 21]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996EQUITY MARKETS:GOLDMAN SACHS REMAINS AT THE TOP   By ANTONIA SHARPEGoldman Sachs maintained its position as the leading global co-ordinatorof international equity issues in 1995, according to data from EuromoneyBondware, Antonia Sharpe writes.Goldman's involvement in Germany'sprivatisation of Deutsche Telekom, scheduled for November, should ensureit retains the top slot in 1996.

While the leadinginsurers posted healthy rises in their recurring profits for the firsthalf to September, this was largely due profit-taking on theirinvestments.The seasonal repatriation of funds from the US ahead of the Marchbook-closing may briefly put upward pressure on the yen on the foreignexchanges, but this is unlikely to have a lasting impact on bondprices.Lehman Brothers in Tokyo estimates yields on the 10-year governmentbond, which closed the last year at 2.9 per cent, to end at 3.4 percent at the end of the first quarter of this year.[London Page 22]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996WORLD BOND MARKETS:A STEP AWAY FROM CITY TRADITION - OPEN GILT REPO TRADING   By PHILIP GAWITH and RICHARD LAPPERThe launch today of the open gilt repo market may be something lessthan a 'second Big Bang', but it does represent a further step awayfrom a City where custom and tradition have played an important role,towards one governed by the more homogenised standards of a globalfinancial services industry.The privileges and arcane idiosyncracies associated with such core Cityinstitutions as gilt edge market makers (GEMMs) and stock exchangemoney brokers (SEMBs) are ebbing away.Already there is evidence of some of the more marginal GEMMs throwingin the towel, while SEMBs will have to cope with the fact that an openrepo market comes in tandem with an open stock-lending market.Ironically, the advent of the gilt repo market is beingenthusiastically welcomed by that other supposed City anachronism - thediscount house. These institutions have, for as long as anyone canremember, served as the intermediaries through which the Bank ofEngland channels liquidity to the commercial banks.Often the butt of ridicule for their quaint practice of havingemployees don top hats every morning in order to do the rounds of theCity's main banks, they have also become increasingly marginalised inrecent years as the clearing banks have gained ascendancy in the moneymarkets.More than 80 per cent of the eligible bills - those which the Bank isprepared to discount in its daily money market operations - are held bythe clearers.As a result, the role of discount houses over the past 10 years hasbeen little more than to serve as brokers on behalf of the clearingbanks.There is a widespread belief, however, that the Bank of England willstart to use the repo as its daily medium of intervention in the moneymarkets (at the moment it conducts repo operations every two weeks, butthe bulk of its daily operations are done through the bill market).This will not be immediate - the Bank will first want to see a depth ofliquidity in the repo market, both in terms of the number ofcounterparties, and the volume going through - but is believed to beinevitable.For its part, the Bank is playing a very straight bat. It said thisweek that 'it did not have plans to change the form of its money marketoperations', but that the development of gilt repo trading 'could makeit sensible to contemplate change later'.The Bank has to tread very carefully, because, in the words of oneobserver, 'any change is a sea change'.A hint that the Bank plans to start using repo alongside eligible billsin its daily operations is sure to be taken as a signal that a move tosole reliance on repo is likely.Some observers believe the Bank will try to run repo and billoperations in tandem.There are two main reasons why such a move is considered likely. First,there is widespread belief that intervening via the repo will be a moreeffective method of managing short-dated interest rates than thecurrent practice of intervening, often three times a day, via the billmarket.Second, it seems most likely to be the modus operandi of a futuresingle European central bank and the UK is unlikely to want to doanything which is at odds with what it might have to do in Europe, ifit participates in monetary union.A study last year by Mr Norbert Schnadt for the London Business Schoolfound that the money market operations of the Banque de France,Bundesbank and Federal Reserve differed from those of the Bank ofEngland in that they were conducted less frequently, utilised onlyrepurchase transactions, and were spread over a very wide range offinancial institutions.It also found that even though the Bank intervened more frequently inthe money markets than the other central banks, sterling rates weremuch more volatile than elsewhere.Recently, however, UK overnight rates have been steadier. Interventionvia repo is also unlikely, in itself, to be sufficient to makeovernight rates more stable.Any shift towards daily use of repo will be welcomed by the discounthouses, because by so doing the Bank will increase the number of activeparticipants in the money markets, diminishing the dominant role of theclearers.The introduction of an open repo market also creates a new tradinginstrument which puts more emphasis on the idea of secured money - ahigh priority in the aftermath of the Barings episode.At the moment, most secured lending and borrowing is done either to thediscount market, or via SEMBs, and through them to GEMMs.Discount houses see an opportunity in this because of their expertisein secured lending.Mr George Blunden, chief executive of Union plc, says: 'Discount houseshave a head start because our job has been secured money markets sincethe beginning of time.' As much as 95 per cent of the discount marketis secured.Mr Ross Jones, chief executive at Gerrard and National plc, adds: 'Thisis the biggest opportunity we have had for years. We see it as apotential new lease of life for the secured sterling money market.'A group like Gerrards has the added advantage of having a SEMB withinthe group, which will be merged with the discount house operations.While the pivotal role of SEMBs will be diminished, stock borrowing andlending will continue, alongside repo, so the relationships they havewill still count.A number of the largest holders of gilts - pension funds andinstitutions - have dealt exclusively with SEMBs, and early indicationsare that they will be happy to continue doing business this way.As new entrants garner market share, institutions will have to widentheir counterparties beyond the small set of SEMBs they havetraditionally dealt with, but loyalty to old relationships looks likelyto be the watchword initially.Discount houses are also confident that if the Bank of England startsto use the repo as an intervention mechanism, it will want a manageableset of counterparties, dedicated to making markets in all conditions.They believe that their chances of playing this role are good.Another development which will encourage the development of the repomarket is the introduction of the European-wide Capital AdequacyDirective, which also takes effect today. CAD encourages a securedmoney market, because the capital requirements for repos are much lowerthan for unsecured ones.[London Page 22]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996WORLD BOND MARKETS:FRANKFURT   By ANDREW FISHERThe German bond market market ended the year quietly but positively,with bund futures generally expected to remain firm.Inflation, now below 2 per cent, is clearly under control and economicgrowth is modest at best. Thus the Bundesbank can sit tight after itspre-Christmas interest rate cuts.With the discount rate now down to 3 per cent, the chances of a furtherreduction are rated as no more than slight by most economists.It has only once fallen below 3 per cent in the last three decades -just after the 1987 stock market crash, when it stayed at 2.5 per centfor six months.Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Union Bank of Switzerland, saidthe discount rate was not likely to fall so low in this cycle.'However,' he added, 'this does not mean that monetary easing is over.'The securities repurchase (repo) rate should fall below the current3.75 per cent. Also, the 5 per cent Lombard rate could also be lowered,since the bottom of previous cycles has seen it at 4 or 4.5 per cent.If the money supply remains weak, the Bundesbank could cut interestrates further, said Mr Bill Smyth of BHF Trust. But the 1987 discountcut to 2.5 per cent did not produce a powerful bond rally, he noted.[London Page 22]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996WORLD BOND MARKETS:LONDON   By CONNER MIDDELMANNAll eyes in the UK government bond market this week will be on giltsale and repurchase agreements, or repos, which starts today.'A whole new world of leverage trades, reverse repos, term stock loans,buy/sells, matched books and, hopefully, very little mayhem willtransform the gilt market,' say analysts at HSBC Greenwell.'We are entering a new evolutionary phase in the market. Repos willimpact on pricing, liquidity management, swaps, curve plays andultimately, we suspect, on official intervention in the money market.'But in the near term, trading is unlikely to be heavily affected byrepos and after trading in a narrow range last week, gilts will have tolook elsewhere for life to be breathed back into the market.The data front offers slim pickings, with M0 figures and the purchasingmanagers' report for December scheduled as the only releases this week.'M0 will be viewed with interest for what it reveals about consumerdemand in December - a month which accounts for over one-quarter oftotal annual retail sales,' notes Mr Nigel Richardson of YamaichiInternational. 'The weekly notes in circulation data suggest that therewas a seasonally adjusted increase in M0 of almost 1 per cent on themonth - this would appear to confirm retailers' reports of strong salesin December.'[London Page 22]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996WORLD BOND MARKETS:INVESTORS ASSESS THEIR STRATEGY FOR 1996 - GOVERNMENT BONDS   By RICHARD LAPPERThe scale of the rally in international government bonds over the lastsix months surprised the markets and left many investors scrambling toincrease their exposures.In assessing their strategy for this year, investors must weigh up theextent to which benign economic fundamentals, especially for the US andEuropean markets, are already reflected in valuations.At the same time, the markets could be affected by a number ofpolitical uncertainties linked to the US presidential elections and thecreation of European Monetary Union.European bonds provided investors with some of the best returns in 1995- with returns (in local currency terms) to December 15 ranging fromaround 15.3 per cent in France and 15.5 per cent in Germany to 19.3 percent in Sweden.Over the last few weeks there has been a wealth of evidence that thegrowth of core economies such as Germany and France is grinding to ahalt and that inflationary pressures are continuing to ease.Furthermore, at their Madrid summit last month European leaders andfinance ministers reaffirmed their commitment to monetary union,suggesting the reduction of fiscal deficits will remain a priority forgovernments across the continent.'Europe is shaping up for a common currency and that suggestsgovernments will wrestle to bring public finances under control. Theseare developments bond investors will be pleased to see,' says Mr CraigShute, bond analyst at Bear Stearns International in London.Similar 'bond-positive' forces are visible in the US, where Treasuriesprovided investors with total returns of more than 17 per cent in 1995.And the current market rally has very different characteristics to thatof 1993, which gave way to a sell-off early in 1994.During 1993, the markets were expecting further monetary tightening -now by contrast, further cuts in interest rates are expected. Theinflation rate is falling - it was rising in 1993 - and some analystsargue that investors have yet to fully adjust their expectations to theextent of the downward trend in inflation.Mr Nigel Richardson, international bond strategist at YamaichiInternational, says US inflation - as measured by the consumer priceindex - has not been as low as its current level of 2.6 per cent since1972. The present situation 'holds out the possibility that there maybe a permanent return to 1960s-style price increases,' suggests MrRichardson.Yet according to the a survey of economic forecasts by ConsensusEconomics Inc, investors expect US inflation to rise to 3.1 per cent inthe longer term.'They are responding fully to the current inflation background on thegrounds that they appear to doubt it will be maintained. In essence,therefore, the bond market has 1980s style yields against a backgroundof 1960s style inflation,' says Mr Richardson.However, there are also good reasons to be cautious. For a start, thescale of the surge in bond prices in 1995 means much of the good newsis already reflected in valuations.Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell by nearly two percentage pointsin 1995, touching 6 per cent by the year end, while in Germany yieldson 10-year bonds had dropped to 6.07 per cent by December 27, a fall ofmore than 1.5 per cent.'With the US and European central banks virtually moving as one to cutinterest rates before year-end, most of the good news for the bondmarkets has been delivered,' says Mr Graham McDevitt, internationalbond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.Mr McDevitt predicts an increase in volatility, arguing that there is ahigh risk of a correction in the first quarter with bond yields risingby 25 to 50 basis points. Economic slowdown could also createdifficulties by undermining fiscal deficit and debt reduction schemes,in turn putting at risk the achievement of Maastricht criteria formonetary union in some countries.The impact of the slowdown will be most clearly apparent in France,where a fall in tax revenues could impair the government's efforts toreduce its fiscal deficit from the current level of more than 5 percent.The industrial action by French railway workers last month is expectedto have reduced growth in the final quarter of 1995 to 0.1 per cent.Finally, while leverage has been an element of the current bull market,it is not thought to represent as serious a threat to the markets'stability as in 1994, when highly geared trades built up in 1993 weresuddenly unwound, aggravating the extent of the sell-off.A popular geared play last year, according to analysts at BZWSecurities, was to finance purchases of US assets with yen borrowingson the grounds that the 'perceived potential for currency loss is smallrelative to the yield pick-up.'BZW says the leveraging has been concentrated on US more than Europeanbond markets and may well be limited to the short end of the Treasurycurve, though 'the impact will still have percolated along the curve.'[London Page 22]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996WORLD BOND MARKETS:NEW YORK   By RICHARD TOMKINSUS Treasuries passed a milestone last week. On Wednesday, the yield onthe benchmark 30-year long bond ended the day below the psychologicallysignificant 6 per cent level for the first time in two years. OnThursday and Friday, it edged down further still, closing the week -and the year - at 5.94 per cent, in marked contrast to the 7.92 percent at which it started the year.The question now is whether yields will fall further still, and WallStreet analysts believe they will. Most indicators point to a weakeningof economic growth in the coming year, further diminishing inflationarypressures.With recession an increasing possibility, analysts confidently expectthe Federal Reserve to continue to reduce the Fed funds rate, with thenext downward movement pencilled in for the Federal Open MarketCommittee meeting of January 30-31.This week, however, could be a quiet one in the bond market, for anyagreement between the president and Congress over a balanced budgetwill almost certainly come too late to allow the flow of governmentdata to resume before the weekend.Most attention is likely to focus on today's publication of theNational Association of Purchasing Managers index for December.

Butwhen it came to football, two senior ministers readily made thenecessary concessions.In the Egyptian football calendar, the highlights of the season are thematches between Cairo rivals Ahli and Zamalek.These succeed in emptying the city's streets and push TV ratings waypast the most gripping soap operas.Facing financial difficulties, the two teams astonished many Egyptiansby putting aside their rivalry on the pitch to take on the powerfulRadio and Television Union which for years has benefited from itsmonopoly on domestic broadcasts by refusing to negotiate fees fortelevising matches.The clubs' financial problems began after the 1990 World Cup in Italy,when the football federation urged clubs to turn professional and signcontracts with players.This led to fierce competition to sign the best footballers whichpushed up transfer fees and forced club directors to look more closelyat their finances.In August, it became obvious that something had to give when Zamalekpaid a record EPounds 600,000 (Dollars 177,000) for Egypt's highestgoal scorer, Ahmed el-Kas.'Faced with this kind of costs, to keep a first class team we had tostart thinking seriously about our finances,' explained Mr Adlyel-Kee'i, manager of Ahli.'Before we just worried about winning our matches but suddenly we hadto think about our performance in terms of profits and losses. Weneeded more income and the television rights seemed an obviouscandidate for change.'At the start of the season in September negotiations between the soccerclubs and the RTU on broadcasting fees were not going well.The clubs complained that the fees, which are always paid to the homeside, were not only too low but also depressed gate earnings becausefans would stay at home to watch the matches live on television.Demands for a better arrangement, however, were given short shrift.'The (Radio and Television Union) is not a bank,' Mr Amin Bassiouni,president of the RTU, was reported as saying. 'We are not responsiblefor the soccer clubs' financial problems.'On November 5, to break the deadlock, Ahli, the national champions,took the unprecedented step of banning TV cameras from its matches.Attendances rose three-fold, and the club said it earned more from gatereceipts than the previous television fee structure.With the first goal scored, Zamalek quickly followed suit.Caught offside and facing the wrath of Egypt's football fans, thestate-run broadcasters quickly called on the government to act asreferee.The deputy prime minister, Mr Kamal el-Ganzouri, and the informationminister, Mr Safwat el-Sherif, were put on the case.As the weeks went by and Ahli and Zamalek stayed off the screens,football fans became more and more restless, with the local pressfirmly in favour of the clubs.With the pressure on, the RTU backed down, and the government steppedin to provide the extra money.A three-year contract which came into force on Saturday, will doublethe clubs' earnings - EPounds 200,000 for matches between Ahli andZamalek and EPounds 150,000 for other matches.'We're very, very happy, it shows we were right to stand up and fight,'said Mr Ali Osman, chairman of Zamalek.[International Page 3]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996JAMAICA PONDERS AN ECONOMIC VICTORY OF SORTS   By CANUTE JAMESThe custodians of Jamaica's truculent economy are celebrating avictory, of sorts.After 18 years of mainly acrimonious relations with the InternationalMonetary Fund, the island has ceased to be a borrowing member. Withforeign reserves covering three months of imports, government officialsare claiming that the new status with the IMF is a victory for theadministration's management of the economy.Others are not so sure. The victory for Jamaica is pyrrhic, and the IMFcan claim a win in getting Jamaica to implement its structuraladjustment policies, say the government's critics. They point tocontinuing currency instability and to billowing inflation. Businessmencomplain that high interest rates - a government tool for dampingdemand and reducing pressure on the exchange rate - are driving themout of business.'After 18 years and being in a relationship with the IMF it mustreflect that we have managed effectively the macro economy,' said MrPercival Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'I am not concernedwhether the IMF will claim some credit. My greater satisfaction is thatthe economic situation is such that we do not need to borrow from themand that we can take our own economic choices in accordance with oursovereign judgments.'There are no victors in this, said Mr Delroy Lindsay, president of thePrivate Sector Organisation of Jamaica. 'This appears to be a draw.Jamaica has made progress in structurally adjusting the economy, but itstill has a far way to go. Inflation is too high, interest rates aretoo high and there is little growth.'Jamaica's relations with the IMF is a litany of repeated and protractednegotiations, agreements reluctantly implemented by successivegovernments because they were politically unpopular. IMF agreementsbecame synonymous with the deterioration of the economy as governmentsfulminated against the Fund's conditions for the structural adjustmentof the economy.But the end to Jamaica's borrowing from the Fund has not coincided withany indication that the persistently wayward economy is settling down.After 18 months of relative stability, the currency has depreciated by16.5 per cent since July after a decline in foreign currency flows tobanks. The central bank was forced to intervene by selling from itsreserves. Economic expansion has been sluggish at just under one percent in 1994. Mr Omar Davies, the finance minister, says 1995 is likelyto have resulted in more of the same. 'Growth will not be spectacular,but it will be positive,' he said.Mr Davies rejects suggestions that the economy is stagnant. 'We arehaving lower levels of growth than we expected,' he said. 'This is notstagnation but low growth.' The finance minister has done theunthinkable in Jamaican politics by publicly admitting to making errorswhich contributed to the current uncertainty in the business climate.The prospects for Jamaica are limited and clear, economists andbusiness leaders concur. A reversal of the deregulation would bedamaging. 'The government has done well in the macro-economic policies,but its management of some aspects has been inadequate,' said MrLindsay. 'Interest rates must come down, the currency allowed to findits own level, inflation will be lower and all other things will fallinto place.'[International Page 3]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MURDER HUNT CONTINUINGEnglish police have reported an encouraging response in their searchfor the murderer of French teenager Celine Figard, whose body wasidentified at the weekend after being found by the roadside.

Throughout theyear, the quarterly numbers have produced pleasant surprises, withresults often beating analysts' estimates, writes Maggie Urry.Corporate America has gone through rapid productivity growth in recentyears, which has meant that even in 1995, with profits rising sharply,companies were still laying off workers and taking large restructuringcharges.Analysts prefer to look at the 'operating earnings', excluding one-offcharges. Forecasters expect the S&P 500 companies to announce earningsper share totalling about Dollars 38 per share compared with Dollars 32in 1994, a rise of nearly 20 per cent.Particularly strong earnings gains are expected from cyclical sectorssuch as aluminium, paper and pulp, and chemicals. Also well ahead willbe technology groups. However, some of these, such as semiconductormakers, issued warnings on profits for the final quarter as salesgrowth weakened and prices came under pressure.Weaker figures are expected from some of the consumer non-durablesgroups, such as the tobacco and restaurants sectors. In February, poorresults are due from retailers.[International Page 15]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF: PRISON MOVE FOR MAFIOSOSicilian Mafia 'boss of bosses' Toto Riina and 14 other Mafia leaderswere switched from Palermo jail to northern Italy following the murderof a prison officer.[International Page 1]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF:GROZNY DEATH BLASTAt least one person was killed and about a dozen injured in a powerfulbomb blast in the Chechen capital Grozny which was apparently aimed at alocal police chief, according to Interfax news agency.[International Page 1]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996ARGENTINE CONGRESS URGED TO SPEED LAWS   By MATTHEW DOMAN   BUENOS AIRESThe Argentine government is stepping up pressure on the nation'sCongress to approve key economic legislation early in the new year.Legislators failed to vote on two important measures in extraordinarysessions held this week.Debate on the measures - a presidential request for additional taxingand budget-trimming powers and a bill to advance reform offederal-provincial government relations - was again suspended late onThursday evening after opposition members of the lower house ofCongress withdrew from the chamber. Their walk-out denied the chamber aquorum and pushed consideration of the bills into January.The government is now insisting that extraordinary congressionalsessions be extended as far as February to win approval of the measuresit argues are critical to repairing the nation's finances in 1996.Argentina's Congress normally takes a long southern summer recess overthe months of December, January and February.The measure considered to be the most important is President CarlosMenem's request for extraordinary powers to cut expenditure and raisetaxes without congressional approval. The government argues that theproposed 'superpowers' are necessary to ensure that the 1996 budget isbalanced and International Monetary Fund fiscal targets are met.The second major measure, the ambitiously titled Reform of the Statelegislation, aims to streamline financial relations between thenational government in Buenos Aires and the country's 23 provinces.The federal government argues that elimination of duplication ofservices in the two tiers of government could save up to Dollars 1.5bna year but is reluctant to confirm that efficiency measures may see theloss of up to 20,000 state sector jobs.The congressional backlog was cleared somewhat earlier this week whenthe upper house of Congress, the Senate, approved the 1996 budget lawand a hotly debated measure to increase taxes on tobacco products.Argentine financial markets have maintained a firm tone in thinholiday-season trade this week, and investors appear content to giveCongress some additional leeway to approve the government-sponsoredmeasures.Economist Raul Buonuome of ING Barings said the markets were willing toaccept that the Senate might not sign-off on the measures until Marchbut had expected lower house approval this week.[International Page 3]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996ISRAEL HAILS 'CONSTRUCTIVE' ATTITUDE FROM SYRIANS   By PATTI WALDMEIR   WASHINGTONIsrael and Syria yesterday extended negotiations into the weekend asthe two sides took cautious steps towards peace in informal talks at asecluded venue where they were able to start to form the sort ofpersonal relationships essential to any peace deal.Each side sent three negotiators to the talks, held in the elegantambiance of the Aspen Institute's Wye Plantation conference centreoutside Washington.Mr Uri Savir, director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry and acrucial negotiator of the Israel-Palestinian peace accord, headed theIsraeli team. The Syrian chief negotiator is Mr Walid Moualem,ambassador to Washington and a confidant of Syrian president Hafezal-Assad. They were joined by four representatives of the USgovernment, whose presence is viewed by both sides as crucial tomediate a deal. That team is headed by Mr Dennis Ross, state departmentMiddle East co-ordinator.Convinced secrecy is essential to progress, all parties imposed a newsblackout. But an Israeli embassy spokesman in Washington stressed the'positive atmosphere' of the talks.'Very good personal contacts' were made, with negotiators from bothsides holding 'a lot of small talks' in the corridors and when theydined together.Given the intense distrust which exists between Israel and Syria anyimprovement in the atmosphere must be progress. And Israeli sourcesnoted a new, more constructive attitude from the Syrians.Analysts point out that the intentions of President Assad arenotoriously difficult to decipher, as he seldom travels to the west andruns a closed and secretive government.But they believe he may have concluded that the time is now ripe forpeace.The assassination of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin hashighlighted the strength of the anti-peace movement in Israel, whichmay persuade Mr Assad that his best interests lie in making a deal withthe current Israeli government rather than having to deal with afuture, potentially more hostile one.Mr Assad is also keen to remove Syria from the list of countries deniedcertain economic benefits from the US because of their alleged supportfor terrorism.[International Page 3]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996SUBSIDY WILL HAVE TO EXCEED DOLLARS 300M: NUCLEAR PRIVATISATION:DECOMMISSIONING MAY LAST MORE THAN 100 YEARS   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources EditorThe government is likely to have to provide several hundred millionpounds for a special fund to pay for cleaning up nuclear power stationsites after next year's privatisation of the industry. The fund willalso have to be given tax-exempt status.Advisers in the City of London are working on the structure of thesegregated fund which was announced earlier this month by Mr Tim Eggar,the energy minister. The fund would be managed by an independent trustto ensure money was available to decommission power stations over aperiod that could last more than 100 years. The fund will have to beendowed with an initial cash amount of between Pounds 200m (Dollars312m) and Pounds 300m. This sum would be increased using earnings fromBritish Energy, the privatised company, to meet decommissioningliabilities. However, contributions would come out of the company'staxed income. So the trust itself would have to be exempt from tax toavoid double taxation.The size of the trust's liabilities is still being calculated. The fundwould be responsible only for long-term decommissioning - monitoringsites while disused reactors 'cooled down' and eventually dismantlingthem after 135 years. The larger costs of the first stage ofdecommissioning a power station, including removal of spent fuel andcontaminated components, would be paid for by British Energy, whichwould also bear the risk of a power station being shut down beforeadequate provisions had been built up.British Energy will also be directly responsible for disposing of spentfuel, which represents the largest part of its total liabilities,estimated at Pounds 6bn.The initial finance for the fund could either be provided by thegovernment or raised through a loan from the private sector. But thegovernment has been told that it should provide the finance itselfbecause a loan would only reduce the potential sale price of BritishEnergy.Another important decision will be the discount rate used to calculatethe size of provisions made by British Energy to meet its liabilities.Present estimates have been based on the 6 per cent rate used by theTreasury. The nuclear industry uses 2 per cent, which means that largerprovisions have to be made to reach the target.The government's Department of Trade and Industry is expected soon topublish details of the capital structure of British Energy.[International Page 4]Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL TIMES FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996SHOPPERS STABBEDA store worker ran amok with three knives yesterday and stabbed 10people.

Heis seen as more conservative and less internationally minded than theking, though diplomats said he was unlikely to change the kingdom'sforeign and economic policies.Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, and a close ally ofthe US. The decree said the prince would take over while the kingenjoyed 'rest and recuperation'.The decision makes official a role the prince has played since the kingfell ill.Although he will officially now chair cabinet meetings and representthe king on official visits, the move may prove temporary if the king'shealth improves, diplomats said yesterday.'It sounds more like a technical move, a kind of regency,' said onediplomat in the kingdom. 'The king is still king. What we don't know ishow much he will still be involved and this will depend on his health.'The king left hospital on December 8 after suffering what wasofficially termed a 'sudden indisposition' but is known to have been astroke.Diabetic and overweight, King Fahd was seen on television yesterdayaided by a walking stick as he received Crown Prince Abdullah andPrince Sultan, the defence minister.Saudi officials yesterday suggested the move was aimed at putting anend to speculation of a power struggle within the kingdom.The talk had been fuelled in recent months by two big shocks. The firstwas the monarch's illness, the second a car bomb on November 13 whichdestroyed a US-staffed Saudi National Guard communications centre inRiyadh, the capital. theIslamic fundamentalists opposed to the regime have latched on to theseevents from their base in London and claimed a power struggle hasbroken out in the royal family.They viewed the bomb attack on the national guards as an attempt toundermine Crown Prince Abdullah.Yesterday's move preceded the unveiling of Saudi Arabia's 1996 budget.Early indications suggested the kingdom would continue public sectorretrenchment, maintaining expenditures at SR150bn (Dollars 25.7bn), thesame as in 1995.Faced with a cash crunch resulting from the collapse of oil prices andthe cost of the 1990-91 Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has since 1994 embarkedon a policy of cutting government expenditures and raising non-oilrevenues.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:TORIES BRACED FOR MINORITY GOVERNMENT: SENIOR MINISTERS ADMIT MAJOR MAYLOSE COMMONS MAJORITY BEFORE END OF 1996   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby CorrespondentGovernment ministers yesterday contemplated the probability that MrJohn Major will lead a minority administration later this year, amidfears that the Conservatives can expect to lose more seats in the Houseof Commons.As left and rightwing Tories indulged in mutual recriminations over therecent defection of Miss Emma Nicholson, MP for Devon West andTorridge, to the Liberal Democrats, senior ministers privately admittedthat the government could expect to lose its Commons majority beforethe end of 1996 - and that it may rely for survival on the support ofthe nine Ulster Unionist MPs.Ministers played down claims by one left-of-centre Tory that at leastsix other MPs were prepared to defect to opposition parties. Yetseveral admitted that by-elections triggered by the deaths of MPs wouldput the Tories into a Commons minority this year. The departure of MissNicholson means the government can now expect two pending by-electionsto cut its Commons majority to just one, if Sir Richard Body, whoremains outside the Tory whip, is excluded from calculations.However, despite increasing signs that his party may have to rely ontheir support in any No Confidence motion, Sir Patrick Mayhew, NorthernIreland secretary, insisted there would be 'no special treatment' forthe UUP.'I recognise no difference in the essential equation by reason ofevents in the last few days or even a longer period,' he told BBC Radio4's Today programme.Other ministers, however, were already contemplating the need forconcessions to the UUP, with one privately conceding that relationswith the Ulster parties would be 'critical' to the government'sfortunes.Calculations about the government's majority coincided with signs thatthe delicate truce between left and rightwing Tories appeared to betottering in the wake of the defection.Mr Michael Portillo, defence secretary, launched a strong attack onMiss Nicholson, rubbishing her claims that the reason for her defectionhad been the party's shift to the right.'It is very silly to say that the party has tilted to the right - thatis completely incredible,' he told BBC radio. 'I think the party isprobably much the same. We have a broad breadth of opinion within theparty.'Mr John Redwood, last year's beaten Tory leadership challenger, alsoattacked the idea of a rightward shift by the government, claiming MrMajor's cabinet reshuffle last July had promoted left of centre MPs.However, Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, rounded on MrPortillo, claiming the party had clearly taken an anti-European stanceand that Miss Nicholson's defection should be heeded. 'There is nodoubt at all that the party has moved to the right,' he said. 'Thatcan't be denied . . . it may be denied, but if it is denied it is afalse denial.'Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a pro-European backbencher, also demanded ahalt to the 'torrent of personal abuse' heaped on Miss Nicholson andcalled on ministers to rise above the warfare between the party'swings.'I would just like them to behave as if they were one cabinet, visiblefor all to see and not in such a way where undoubtedly the unhappinessproduced has led to two defections in three months. We cannot affordany more and I trust we will not have any more,' he said.

It estimatesthe scheme will create extra recurrent costs of Pounds 130m to Pounds250m a year for self-employed business managers and mean big increasesin red tape.Mr Andrew Smith, Labour's shadow chief secretary, is also concerned thescheme contains a 'hidden tax bombshell'. He said yesterday theintroduction of self-assessment later this year would increase theTreasury's tax take by some Pounds 850m in 1997-98.Labour is expected to raise its objections to the scheme in the Commonson Thursday when the Finance Bill is published.Mr Smith said the increase in tax revenue would occur because theself-employed would make their assessments next year on the basis ofcurrent-year activities rather than those for the previous year.Because of anticipated increases in inflation and economic growth, thechange to current-year assessment would allow the Treasury to take morein tax from the self-employed.'While the principle of self-assessment makes sense, the way thegovernment is going about it on the current deadlines is a disaster,'said Mr Smith.He revealed that Labour would call for aspects of self-assessment to bedelayed to avoid confusion.But Mr Smith would give no guarantee that Labour would abandon theself-assessment plans, arguing that a new government might create newdifficulties by reversing changes of such magnitude.A spokesman for the Inland Revenue confirmed that the government wouldreceive the additional Pounds 850m in 1997-98. But he said it was a'one-off shift' that would not be repeated in future years.'Overall, self-assessment amounts to a clearer system with moredefinite deadlines - and one which people will find easier to operate,'he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996SHORTS:THOUSANDS HIT BY WATER SHORTAGES AFTER SUDDEN THAWA sharp rise in temperatures following freezing weather over Christmasleft thousands of UK residents facing water shortages and flooded homesas mains and domestic pipes burst.

Mr Clarke believes that the decisionto participate in a single currency is primarily an economic one.However, Mr Waldegrave said the decision to join was primarily 'an actof political will and choice'.He also hinted that Mr John Major's successful campaign to persuade theEU to study the implications of two-tier monetary union - with only asmall minority of countries joining the proposed single currency - ismotivated by a desire to delay the project.'I do think that it is possible to imagine technical questions whichwill be raised which will worry those who are going in very much,' MrWaldegrave said. 'The damage from a badly established union will bequite considerable.'The chief secretary also made it clear that he will contest anycriticism he may face in the Scott report on arms sales toIraq, due to be published in the next few weeks. Leaked drafts of thereport criticised Mr Waldegrave for failing as a Foreign Officeminister in the late 1980s to announce an apparent softening in thegovernment's policy on the arms embargo with Iraq.Mr Waldegrave, who has made further submissions to Lord Justice Scott,said: 'My conscience is entirely clear.' He would only considerresigning if he could be persuaded that his 'memory of the wholebusiness is so wrong'.He added that it would not only be his memory that was at fault butthat of 'the whole Foreign Office'.On next year's public expenditure negotiations, he said he would startvisiting ministries with a view to securing cuts in the early spring.One of the initial targets of his scrutiny will be the Pounds 15bn costto government of public bodies at arm's length from ministries andquangos. He said he was looking for savings of several hundred millionpounds in their running costs. He will also maintain pressure onspending departments to substitute private finance forgovernment-financed capital projects. 'In terms of extra cash flowthere is probably more to come from that,' he said.His other target will be to step up the government's fight againstfraud, especially in the social security budget.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:CHIRAC CONCEDES DIALOGUE NEEDED ON REFORMS   By ANDREW JACK in Paris   PARISMr Jacques Chirac, the French president, made a sharp break with thepractice of his predecessor, Mr Francois Mitterrand, on Sunday night byraising the political content of the country's traditional New Year'sEve address from its head of state.In an address lasting nearly 15 minutes and broadcast on mosttelevision news channels, Mr Chirac devoted much of his time todefending his decisions over the last few months and how they tied into his election campaign promises.He made patriotic play of France's historical mission and globalimportance, and its continued commitment to brotherhood, tolerance andjustice.Referring to the widespread strike action since last November, whichwas prompted by his government's proposed social security reforms, hecalled the resulting period one of 'crisis'.In his strongest statement of support for Mr Alain Juppe, he praisedthe 'courage and determination' of the prime minister, as well as therest of the government.However, in a sign of implicit criticism, he said that one lesson to bedrawn from the experience was the need for greater dialogue andconsultation - something which he acknowledged had not beencharacteristic of France in the past.Another lesson - in a jibe at his political predecessors - was that 'itis no longer possible to govern as we have for the last 20 years' withonly piecemeal reforms. He stressed the need for a country able to copewith 'global competition'.He said his aim remained to build a 'new France' based on justice,unity and resonsibility, and his top priority remained to reduceunemployment - which remains at more than 11.5 per cent.He placed less emphasis than in a previous television interview lastOctober on fiscal rigour, but talked about the need to set up acreative, productive economy. He pledged that taxes - which have risensince his election - would be cut as soon as possible.President Chirac made time to discuss the French commitment to Europe -a point brought home by the EU's flag hanging alongside that of his owncountry on the wall behind him.However, he also stressed the need for change in the administration ofthe EU so that it was 'more attentive' to the daily needs of theFrench, including their 'social hopes' and the 'real priority' ofemployment.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:BEACON FOR EMERGING DEMOCRACYDemocracy can be a baffling business. In Soviet times, Russia's voterscould vote for only one party whose political philosophy was force-fedto them from birth. In last month's parliamentary elections they had achoice of 43 parties with each one claiming to have the only answer toRussia's woes.Such a drastic democratic upheaval has clearly left many Russiansbewildered and may help explain why more than one-fifth of them optedfor the familiar and voted for the return of the Communists. But theelections also proved an education for Russia's political leaders whoare now scrambling to learn the lessons before the all-importantpresidential elections scheduled in six months' time.The Magnitogorsk Worker, the local newspaper for the Urals industrialtown founded as part of Stalin's industrialisation drive, encapsulatedmany of the confusions and controversies that came to dominate thecampaign. In so doing it reflected, in microcosm, the social pain andideological uncertainties that continue to bedevil Russia.The newspaper, founded in 1930 and still proudly bearing a Sovietemblem on its front page urging the proletariat of the world to unite,provided full, lively, and generally fair coverage of the campaign,encouraging those who see the media as an important factor in thedevelopment of a healthy civil society.Like most of Russia's local newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Worker couldhave been under enormous pressure from many quarters. The list of sixparliamentary candidates for the city seat included the deputy head ofthe local administration and a director of the steel combine whichemploys 60,000 workers and dominates the region's economy.But Mr Georgy Tikhonov, the chief editor, argued that the newspaper'srole was simply to provide an objective forum for the debate andencourage readers to participate in the vote. 'This newspaper does notagitate for or against particular candidates. . . it agitates forsomething else: for the widest possibility for people to discuss openlyone or another candidacy and the course of the campaign itself. Read,think, and make your choice]' the newspaper stated.In comparison with most western newspapers, the Magnitogorsk Workerprovided few reports and opinions from its journalists but carriedextensive personal contributions from the candidates and scores ofletters from its readers.Mr Alexander Pochinok, the incumbent deputy who represented the thenpro-government Russia's Choice party in the previous vote in 1993, wasthe dominant figure in the campaign for one of Russia's 225directly-elected seats.Although he supported the government's harsh monetary policies whichmany critics blamed for Russia's social ills, Mr Pochinok boldlylaunched his campaign by concentrating on social problems and promisingto improve the lot of the elderly.But his attempt to seize the mantle of social concern was fiercelycontested by the Communist candidate who wrote an emotional tiradeagainst the government's policies and promised a restoration of thecertainties of the Soviet era.These themes were echoed in the opinions of the newspapers' readers whoexpressed impassioned and disparate views.'During the war, millions were evacuated here and resettled. They weregiven work and a roof but now they have been thrown out. Every honestperson will vote for the Communists,' said one.'I do not want to return to the miserable plague-stricken camp of thepast but I fear the thorny road forward to civilisation,' commentedanother.One reader planned not participate in the elections at all given theywere merely a 'political spectacle distracting the country from itstrue problems' while another con demned the newspaper itself for givingtoo much space to the 'so-called democrats'.The Magnitogorsk Worker made clear it was aware of some dirty electoraltactics during the campaign but did not identify who was responsiblefor them in order not to prejudice opinions. In the week before thevote, it carried an item about a pensioner who had been contacted bysomeone claiming to represent the local telephone company. 'Votecorrectly and your telephone bill will be paid in advance for a year,'the mysterious caller promised.On the eve of the elections, the newspaper urged its readers to go tothe polls although it recognised that many voters were still confusedby the extraordinary range of parties on the ballot paper.The results were slow to trickle in and the Magnitogorsk Worker did notpublish the preliminary outcome until three days after the poll. Theelectors of Magnitogorsk had returned the pro-market Mr Pochinok astheir local candidate but they had also lodged a strong protest votebacking Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democraticparty and the Communists in the simultaneous ballot for the seatsassigned on the basis of proportional representation.In all, 39 parties - including Russia's Choice - failed to garner morethan the 5 per cent of the vote required to win any of the 225 seats inthe 450-strong parliament allocated by proportional representation. MrPochinok, for example, has been elected as a representative of a partywhich will be unable to form its own faction in parliament.One voter told the newspaper: 'Voting is most democratic. But you mustwrite that Hitler also came to power in Germany by democratic means. Wemust go forward to the presidential elections but people must bevigilant.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:SCALFARO SEEKS CLARITY ON POLLS   By ROBERT GRAHAM in Rome   ROMEPresident Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has appealed to Italy's politicalparties to come forward with clear ideas on how long the government ofMr Lamberto Dini should last and to give a firm calendar for the lifeof the current parliament.The head of state's appeal was contained in his annual messagedelivered on New Year's eve.The highly political message was delivered in advance of this week'smeeting of the parliamentary group leaders to fix the terms of a debateon the future of the government following the resignation tendered lastSaturday by Mr Dini, the prime minister.As expected President Scalfaro rejected the resignation, insistingparliament must decide. In his message, President Scalfaro reinforcedthis point. 'In a few days the debate in the chamber of deputies willprovide the right opportunity to know precisely what the variouspolitical groups want and to see whether a consensus emerges that isboth clear to the general public and useful to the head of state.'The debate is likely to be staged next week, allowing further time forthe political leaders to negotiate behind the scenes. Until now none ofthe main political parties has come forward with a proposal either forthe continuance of the Dini government or a date for general elections.But Mr Dini, who has been in close touch with the main party leaders,appeared confident over the weekend that he would remain in office.Backed by President Scalfaro, he has argued strongly that the countrycannot afford a government crisis and a general election during Italy'ssix-month presidency of the European Union which lasts until June.Despite underlining the importance of parliament, the tone throughoutPresident Scalfaro's 35-minute New Year's message was of a man whointended to use his limited constitutional powers to the full. He madehis own preferences plain.He went out of his way to praise the 11 month premiership of Mr Dini -so indicating his desire to see the former deputy director of the Bankof Italy remain at the helm during Italy's EU presidency. He also saidhe would like to see the current legislature carry out a proper reformof the constitution in time for the celebration in 1998 of the 50thanniversary of its introduction. This was seen as a none too subtlehint that parliament should not be dissolved before institutionalreform has been tackled.Yesterday several political parties took exception to what theyregarded as President Scalfaro's overtly partisan stance. In particularthe president's message was attacked by the rightwing NationalAlliance, by the Greens and by Reconstructed Communism, which wasformed from the hardline members of the former Communist party.Editorial comment, Page 15Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:PARTIES WEIGH UP RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY   By ROBERT GRAHAMPolitical decisions in Italy are rarely made in a hurry.No one wishes to assume the responsibility - and risk - of the firstmove. This is why the politicians will take their time in deciding thefate of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's government even though they havehad ample notice of the administration's limited duration.Mr Dini tendered his resignation on Saturday to President Oscar LuigiScalfaro, after approving an additional financial package for the 1996budget. This was his last self-appointed task.President Scalfaro has now thrown the responsibility back to parliamentto decide what should happen next. This will take the form of aparliamentary debate later this week or early next week.Having acquired a taste of power over the last 11 months, Mr Dini ismore than willing to stay on. Moreover, President Scalfaro, who has thefinal say on a date for the next general election, is clearly anxiousthe former director general of the Bank of Italy should remain inoffice.President Scalfaro believes it is too late for a big political shake-upnow that Italy has the responsibility (since January 1) of thepresidency of the European Union. He thus wants Mr Dini to remain primeminister - probably with a revamped cabinet - for the duration of thesix-month presidency. But this seems to be part of a broader strategyby Mr Scalfaro, a former Christian Democrat interior minister, to allowparliament to survive until 1997, thus permitting more time for arecreation of the centre grouping which dominated post-war Italianpolitics until 1992.The parliamentary debate is expected to focus on three broad scenarios:* Mr Dini heads the government to ensure a stable EU presidency andpermit elections around June.* Mr Dini presides over a caretaker government with elections held inlate February or early March.* A broad-based government is formed lasting up to two years to permita programme of big institutional reforms.The first scenario involves several variations. For instance, Mr Dinicould seek to maintain the backing of the centre-left parties, headedby the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) who supported his governmentof non-parliamentarians all last year. This would provide a fragilemajority in parliament unless a prior understanding was reached withthe rightwing alliance headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the former primeminister. The government would be little more than a caretaker, whilethe parties indulged in a six-month election campaign.Alternatively Mr Dini, who has no political base of his own, could tryto broaden the backing for the government to include the small centreparties in the rightwing alliance. This would have the advantage oflessening the exposure of the centre-left as the government's mainbacker and would provide some chance of parliament pushing through afew reforms in the next few months. It would also help offset thedestabilising effect of the populist Northern League, which, withalmost 80 deputies, retains considerable power to swing votes.The second scenario is straight-forward and would mean parliament beingdissolved shortly after the debate on the government's future. Mr Diniwould remain in office but with no real executive power. Given that itnormally takes a good six weeks to two months to form a governmentafter an election, Italy would be without an effective administrationprobably until May.The third scenario is the most complex. At a minimum it would require acommitment from the PDS, some of the centre parties and the bulk of MrBerlusconi's rightwing alliance to back the idea of carrying out overthe next two years important institutional reforms such asstrengthening the prime minister's position and ending the duplicationof the bicameral system. This would be done either by allowing a'technical' government to continue as the executive while a specialbicameral commission was formed to draw up the reforms; or a newgovernment would be formed, drawing ministers from the partiessupporting it. The onus would then be on the government to draw up thereforms.Mr Berlusconi has been exploring this idea of a broad-based governmentover the Christmas break. His scheduled trial later this month forcorruption probably played a part in his change of mind. But the PDS issceptical of his chances, and the rightwing National Alliance (AN), hismain ally, is openly hostile to the idea. The parties themselves arechanging too fast for a broad-based alliance to survive and be useful.The PDS has the power to force elections simply by refusing to continuebacking Mr Dini; but of late Mr Massimo D'Alema, the party leader, hasdropped his insistence on an early vote. This is because thePDS-dominated centre-left is increasingly divided on strategy and besetby doubts about being led in an election by the uncharasmatic Mr RomanoProdi, the Bologna academic and former head of Iri, the state holdingcompany.The centre-left staked much on striking an electoral deal with amovement headed by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the former Milan magistrate.But Mr Di Pietro may now be prevented from entering politics because ofhis own problems with the law that have arisen as aresult ofinvestigations over his abuse of office before he joined the Milanmagistrates' anti-corruption team.Against this background, the simplest option for the political partiesis to allow Mr Dini to stay with the excuse that Italy needs anidentifiable government to play its full role as EU chairman. This is aconvenient fig-leaf behind which the politicians can hide theirconfusion. But it will merely postpone the day of reckoning at theballot-box and is unlikely to provide an authoritative government, evenif Mr Dini has proven to be a skilled and ambitious operator of thesystem.Robert GrahamBack to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:SAMPAIO LEADS AS PORTUGAL NEARS VOTE   By PETER WISE in Lisbon   LISBONCampaigning for Portugal's presidential election on January 14 beganthis week with Mr Jorge Sampaio, the Socialist candidate, showing aclear lead over Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister for 10 yearsuntil his centre-right Social Democrats were beaten in October'sgeneral election.Mr Sampaio, a former Socialist party leader who stepped down as mayorof Lisbon to run for the presidency, was given 41.6 per cent of thevote in a newspaper poll yesterday, compared with 34.9 per cent for MrCavaco Silva. A weekend poll based on a broader sample of more recentinterviews gave them 50 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.Since the return of democracy in 1974, Portugal has consistentlyelected presidents from the party opposed to the government so thateach acts as a counterweight to the other. Mr Cavaco Silva says thatPortugal will 'capsize' if all political weight is shifted to theSocialists, who are also dominant in local government.However, the polls indicate that most voters are inclined to provideadditional support for the Socialists, who are four seats short of aparliamentary majority, by electing Mr Sampaio. Under Portugal's 'semi-presidentialist' constitution, the president has the power to dissolveparliament and call an early election when governments run intodifficulties.Mr Antonio Guterres, the prime minister, is campaigning for the backingof a Socialist president. This would help his minority government meetelection commitments both to spend more on social reforms and exercisethe budgetary discipline required to meet the convergence targets forEuropean economic and monetary union.Ministers say Mr Cavaco Silva would seize the first opportunity todismiss the government if he won the election, although he has pledgedto co-operate fully with the Socialists in the interests of stability.The former prime minister's attempt at a transition from an aloofdecision-maker to the kind of benevolent figure of tolerance andconcern that Mr Ma rio Soares, the outgoing Socialist president, hasmade popular is proving difficult to achieve.Despite popular respect for his integrity, support for Mr Sampaio, aless charismatic leader, appears to be based more on disapproval of hisrival, whose government had grown increasingly unpopular before itsdefeat, and on backing for Mr Guterres.The government is avoiding decisive measures, including thepresentation of the 1996 budget, until after the presidential vote. Ithopes the political honeymoon that followed its election can beprolonged long enough to benefit Mr Sampaio.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:RUSSIA PLEDGES TOUGH LINE ON ECONOMY   By JOHN THORNHILL in Moscow   MOSCOWRussia's economics ministry yesterday pledged it would continue topursue a harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy andcut the monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent despite thestrong anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentaryelections.However, the ministry's tough stance, contained in an annual economicforecast, was seemingly at odds with the the softer rhetoric employedby President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year'sEve.'The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who today are poorshould begin to live better,' he said, promising the government wouldrectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which hascaused great social distress.Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in financial circles whichwas responsible for diverting money intended for social spending.Last week, Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employingrhetoric reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce 'saboteurs' whowere responsible for undermining the reform programme.He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them forsavings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that thegovernment may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing upinflation early this year. The government may come under intensepressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoralfavour before the presidential election in June.But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradictionbetween tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.* Russia confirmed that it had missed the New Year deadline fordestroying thousands of tanks and other military hardware beyond theUral Mountains and said Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan hadalso failed to meet the treaty commitment, Reuter reports from Moscow.General Dmitry Kharchenko said Moscow wanted to push the December 31,1995 deadline pledged by the Soviet Union in 1991 back to the end of1998. The pledge had cleared the way for ratification of theConventional Forces in Europe treaty.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:PACT TO OPEN UP STATE CONTRACTS: INTERNATIONAL NEWS DIGESTPublic procurement contracts valued at several billion dollars a yearwill be thrown open to international competition under a World TradeOrganisation agreement which took effect yesterday.The agreement covers more countries and purchasers - and applies to awider range of contracts - than existing rules agreed under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade 15 years ago. In addition to coveringservices for the first time, the new rules extend to procurement bysub-central purchasers, such as states, provinces, departments andutilities, as well as to central governments.Though not all WTO members are obliged to participate in the agreement,it has been ratified by more than 20 governments, including the US, theEuropean Union's 15 members, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland.Singapore and several other countries plan to subscribe to it.The accord excludes defence contracts, EU telecoms and the US regionaland urban public transport sector.The complex new rules set a variety of thresholds, denominated inSpecial Drawing Rights, above which contracts must be opened tocompetition. The threshold for central government procurement isSDR130,000 (Pounds 125,000), for sub-central purchasers aboutSDR200,000, and for utilities roughly SDR400.000.The agreement also lays down specified tendering procedures, to ensurethat foreign bidders and foreign goods and services are treated on thesame basis as those in the purchaser's home country.

There were no immediate reports of lossof life.Information was slowed by a lack of telephone lines in the remote areabetween the towns of Palu, the provincial capital, and Tolitoli, to thenorth-east of Palu.Up to 1m people are believed to live in the 150-mile belt betweenTolitoli and Palu. Most of them live in narrow coastal strips separatedby mountains.Tremors and quakes are fairly common events in Indonesia. Butcasualties and damage are often minimal because of low populationdensities in many areas outside towns and cities. Reuter, JakartaWave of violence in CorsicaGunmen shot dead a Corsican nationalist and three bombs exploded on theFrench Mediterranean island yesterday, raising fears of a renewedvendetta between rival separatists.Gilbert Rossi, a 34-year-old member of the Cuncolta Naziunalistamovement, was killed by unknown attackers outside a restaurant duringNew Year celebrations in the port of Ajaccio in the south-west of theisland.Three bombs, including one at a flat owned by another Cuncolta member,went off in the town before dawn and police defused a fourth device. Noone was hurt in the explosions. Police said no one had claimedresponsibility for the killing or the blasts.The Cuncolta is linked to the hardline 'historic wing' of the outlawedCorsican National Liberation Front (FLNC).Rossi was the 13th nationalist to die since a bloody feud erupted lastyear between the FLNC and the rival Movement for Self-Determination(MPA), both demanding greater Corsican autonomy from France. Corsicahas been hit by more than a dozen bomb attacks since Christmas.

The FIShas been battling the government since 1992. Mr Ouyahia is not believedto have taken a lead part in the negotiations.That he is among the youngest prime ministers the country has knownpoints to an attempt by Mr Zeroual to reach out to a younger generationin a country where more than 70 per cent of the people are under theage of 30. But Mr Ouyahia's appointment sheds little light on MrZeroual's post election politics.'Zeroual has opted for a safe pair of hands, a skilled functionaryrather than a political heavyweight,' said one Algerian expertyesterday. 'It means the composition of the government is not whatreally concerns him.'Mr Ouyahia's government is not expected to last longer than a yearbecause Mr Zeroual has promised legislative elections, although he hasyet to commit himself to a specific date.The prime minister's task will centre on overseeing economic reformsagreed with the International Monetary Fund and preparing for theelections.Mr Ouyahia is perhaps best known among his colleagues for arranging anaccord to end the conflict between Tuareg rebels and the Maligovernment in 1992, a task which won him recognition as a skilfulnegotiator.He was named ambassador to Mali to oversee implementation of theaccord, before becoming state secretary for co-operation and Maghrebaffairs in 1993.Although some experts have suggested the choice of a diplomat withnegotiating skills points to a determination on the part of thepresident to seek national reconciliation, any negotiations with theFIS or other opposition parties which opposed the presidential electionare likely to be conducted directly from the president's office ratherthan that of the prime minister.In a system in which the presidency enjoys wide powers, the primeminister's office is entrusted with more of a management role.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:JAPAN PUBLIC PRESSED ON LOAN BAILOUT   By GERARD BAKER in Tokyo   TOKYOMr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minster, has urged an increasinglysceptical Japanese public to accept the government's plan to spend morethan Y685bn (Pounds 4.37bn) in bailing out the country's failed housingloan companies.In a New Year message to the nation, Mr Murayama signalled the start ofwhat is likely to be a fierce political struggle over the bailout inthe new parliamentary session which begins later this month.The prime minister acknowledged the unpopularity of the plan, whichwill cost every individual in the country at least Y5,500, but said ithad been an unavoidable and 'painful' decision.He promised a full investigation into the causes of the failure of theseven companies. 'I will try from now on to shed light on the entireproblem,' he added.Last month the cabinet agreed to allocate Y685bn from next year'sbudget to pay for the cost of partially reimbursing creditors of thebankrupt housing lenders. The government also committed itself tospending more if the final costs of liquidation turn out to be greaterthan is forecast.The companies, which were established by the leading banks in the1970s, are on the verge of collapse under a pile of nonperforming loanswhich were advanced mostly in a bout of reckless lending to theproperty sector during the bubble economy of the late 1980s.Popular opposition to the principle of spending taxpayers' money hasescalated since the decision was announced and will be exploited byopposition parties when the parliamentary discussion of the nationalbudget begins at the end of January.Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected leader of the main opposition NewFrontier party, signalled his determination at the weekend to opposethe bailout if the government did not provide a satisfactory anddetailed account of who was responsible for the costly mess.The government has already attempted to propitiate the public's angerby hastily removing the senior bureaucrat at the ministry of finance,Mr Kyosuke Shinozawa. Mr Shinozawa, the administrative vice ministerfor finance, resigned last week, in part to take responsibility for thehousing loan problem.But the opposition wants the blame for the fiasco to be spread muchmore liberally among both politicians and bureaucrats.In its sights are Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, and mostintriguingly, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the international trade ministerand leader of the Liberal Democratic party, the largest coalitionpartner. Mr Hashimoto was finance minister during the period when mostof the reckless lending of the housing loan companies was undertaken.In 1990 the finance ministry issued guidelines to all financialinstitutions to curtail their lending to property-related companies.But the instructions did not apply to the housing lenders whichcontinued to pour money into highly speculative real estate projects.The finance ministry has promised a full inquiry into the circumstancesof the housing lenders' demise, and has promised that those foundresponsible, bankers, politicians and bureaucrats, will be held toaccount.But even a spate of resignations may not prove enough in the currentpolitical heat. Many members of the socialist party, the second largestcoalition member, are profoundly unhappy about the bailout, as are someofficials in the finance ministry.If the political pressure intensifies, some members of the coalitionmay break ranks and oppose the deal.Defeat for the government on such a crucial part of its budget plansfor 1996 would have potentially disastrous consequences for itsviability.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:CONSERVATIVE ABDULLAH TAKES REINS OF POWER   By ROULA KHALAFSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, yesterday entrusted with therunning of the government by his half-brother King Fahd, has beendescribed as more conservative than the king, less likely toaccommodate the west and possibly prone to pumping less oil to raiseprices.However, as experts and diplomats were quick to point out, Saudi Arabiarun by the crown prince is likely to follow the same economic andforeign affairs policies the west has become accustomed to under KingFahd.If the king's health improves, the handing over of the running of thegovernment may be no more than a temporary measure and, until CrownPrince Abdullah takes over for good, King Fahd will continue to havethe final word on big decisions.One of more than 30 surviving sons of the late King Abdul Aziz, the71-year-old crown prince is known as a traditional bedouin who enjoysimportant ties to the tribes of Saudi Arabia. The fact that he had adifferent mother from the king's other powerful brothers has meant thathe comes from a less prominent branch than the other sons of King AbdulAziz.But as the closest in age to King Fahd, he was named crown prince whenthe latter took over in 1982. Although this has been a source ofrivalry with the rest of the clan, the sons of Abdul Aziz are known tostick together when times get rough.The crown prince is well respected and known for a stutter which seemsto disappear when giving public speeches. The bedouin base is his mainsource of strength. Since 1963, he has commanded the National Guard, alargely bedouin force which looks after internal security and acts as acounterweight to the army.Citing his strong links to Syria and the Palestinians, as well as areported reluctance to allow American troops to set up their base inSaudi Arabia during the 1990 Gulf war, the crown prince is believed tobe less internationally minded than his half-brother. He is not knownto speak English, for example, and has played a role in cultivatinglinks with the Arab world.This, however, say diplomats, is unlikely to have a bearing on theKingdom's close ties to the west, especially the US. 'The US allianceis a vital strategic alliance which the Saudis will not do much tochange,' a diplomat said yesterday.Moreover, according to Saudi observers, the crown prince played aprominent part in drumming up public support within the Kingdom for theGulf war.'He is more decisive than the king but less reflective perhaps,' saidone veteran Saudi observer who knows the crown prince.'The king is very cautious and tends to see procrastination as avirtue. Abdullah is less hesitant in his style and quicker to judge.'Such a style, said the observer, may translate into more forcefuldealings with Islamic fundamentalists who have bombarded the kingdomwith faxes from a propaganda base in London.Islamic dissidents are also suspected of having perpetrated theNovember 13 bomb attack on a US-staffed Saudi National Guardcommunications centre in Riyadh.As the 1996 budget unveiled yesterday suggests, economic reformsstarted in 1994 will continue. Faced with the collapse of oil prices,Saudi Arabia has had to clamp down on spending in recent years, give alarger role to the private sector and boost non-oil revenues.In an address to the nation, Crown Prince Abdullah said: 'No doubt youknow the financial situation that emerged from the (1991) Gulf war andthat your government had (earlier) promised to continue its treatmentso matters could return to what they used to be - strength andbalance.'The kingdom in recent years has been committed to keeping crude outputat 8m barrels a day in order to avoid a repeat of the mid 1980s, whenit was faced with falling prices and falling production. Diplomats saidyesterday that the crown prince was in the 1970s believed to favour apolicy of increased production but that they were confident the storywould not hold today.As reforms are pursued, however, diplomats said yesterday that for aslong as the crown prince is only acting on behalf of the king, he willhave to find a way to accommodate the king's other prominent brothersto minimise friction.This may mean that in governing he will resort to consultation and seekthe co-operation of from powerful members such as Prince Sultan, thedefence minister, who is next in line for succession.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:INDONESIA'S CONGLOMERATES LOOK TO MARKET FORCES   By GREG EARL in Jakarta   JAKARTAIndonesia's big conglomerates, long regarded as 'crony capitalists'receiving government favours, are becoming much more dependent onmarket forces for their growth, according to a study.The study of sales and asset growth of the country's top groups,conducted by the Indonesian Business Data Centre, a private agency,also shows that 300 businesses are responsible for about half thecountry's gross domestic product.The centre's director, Mr Christianto Wibisono, said the study showed adistinct move away from reliance on government-awarded licences forbusiness growth in Indonesia. He said only 27 of the groups were nowdependent on managed trading and monopoly arrangements although many ofthe larger groups had been established under those business conditions.The 300 groups are estimated to have increased sales by 15 per cent in1994 to Dollars 74bn (Pounds 48bn).The figures point to some increased concentration in the hands of thelargest groups with the 10 largest recording a 17 per cent increase insales to Dollars 26bn. There were 31 groups with total sales of Dollars350m, accounting for 55 per cent of total sales, whereas in 1993 therewere estimated to have been 24 groups with that level of salesaccounting for 49 per cent of total revenue.Concentration is more evident on an assets basis with 56 groupscontrolling three quarters of the Dollars 118bn in total assets of the300 businesses.The dominance of the economy by people of Chinese descent is underlinedby the fact that only 79 of the 300 groups are owned by ethnicIndonesians and 203 by non-ethnic Indonesians, predominantly Chinese.While there are few surprises among the company's largest companies,several new players are fast emerging, with 11 groups estimated to havegrown by 50 per cent in 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:TALKS TO RESUME ON US BUDGET IMPASSE   By PATTI WALDMEIR in Washington   WASHINGTONUS President Bill Clinton will meet congressional Republican leaderslater today to resume talks on ending the protracted federal budgetdispute, after extended negotiations over the New Year weekend failedto yield agreement either on balancing the budget, or on the moreimmediate problem of ending the partial government shutdown.Mr Clinton and Republicans met throughout Saturday and Sunday, beforerecessing for New Year's Day. Both sides said no significant decisionswere taken during those negotiations, which focused on outlining areasof disagreement.But Mr Bob Dole, Senate majority leader, said negotiators were nowready to 'start making the tough decisions'. And there were signs ofsome flexibility from radical freshmen Republicans in Congress: severalof them, interviewed on weekend television programmes, made clear thatthey were willing to compromise on the Dollars 245bn (Pounds 159bn) taxcut included in their plan, saying balancing the budget was moreimportant than cutting taxes. Mr Clinton favours a much more modest taxcut.Mr Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said today's negotiationswould focus on 'trade-offs' between cuts in healthcare spending, taxesand welfare needed to balance the budget over seven years, as agreed byboth sides in November. There was no sign at the weekend that the twosides had resolved the basic philosophical dispute which underlies thebudget impasse: whether to shift power away from the federal governmentto the states, as the Republicans want; and whether to curb guaranteesof healthcare for the poor and elderly.Both issues are likely to influence the outcome of this year'spresidential election campaign, which will soon shift into top gearwith a concentration of state presidential primary elections inFebruary and March.Parallel efforts will resume today to solve the more immediate problemof getting federal employees back to work, and ending the shutdown,which has already lasted more than a fortnight.The President and First Lady spent New Year's Eve and Day away from thefrustrations of the budget impasse, celebrating with 1,000 friends atthe Hilton Head resort in South Carolina, where they attended atraditional New Year seminar to debate subjects such as 'morals,manners, and today's pop culture' and 'politics, media and the declineof civility'.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:RHODES' HEIRS RETURN TO ZAMBIA'S COPPER MINES: AFTER 25 YEARS OFNATIONALISATION, BOARDROOMS IN JOHANNESBURG AND LONDON COULD AGAINDETERMINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS LEADING INDUSTRY, REPORTS TONY HAWKINSCecil John Rhodes would have relished the irony. Twenty five yearsafter Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding president, nationalised thecountry's copper mines, the government of President Frederick Chilubamay be on the verge of taking the first step towards meeting itspromise to put the industry back into the private sector.Negotiations with Anglo American Corporation for a feasibility studyfor the development of the Konkola copper mining project are close toconclusion, say industry officials.It would be a move as rich in symbolism as the 1969 take-over itself,seen at the time as heralding a new era for a country that was oncelittle more than a fiefdom of Rhodes' British South Africa Company.Rhodes' vision of the company blazing a commercial trail from the Capeto Cairo, in the name of an empire run by Englishmen, 'is now buried -I hope and pray, never to rise again in this part of Africa,' declaredMr Kaunda, architect of what turned out a disastrous socialistprogramme.Once again, however, boardrooms in Johannesburg and London coulddetermine the development of an industry still at the heart of Zambia'seconomy, accounting for more than 90 per cent of export earnings.With reserves at the Nchanga copper mine, which supplies ore to thestate-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), likely to beexhausted by the end of the decade, the government is under mountingpressure to give the go-ahead for the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)Konkola project.Although widely anticipated, the decision to invite the South Africanmining house, which has a 27.3 per cent stake in ZCCM, to prepare astudy and lead a consortium to develop the new mine will becontroversial, not just because Anglo American is being invited back.The Konkola decision will also have far-reaching implications for theprivatisation of ZCCM itself.While Zambia's privatisation programme has accelerated in the past year- by the end of September, 87 out of 217 business units had beenprocessed, resulting in a significant inflow of new investment andexpertise - progress in dealing with the politically sensitive coppermining industry has been slow.Whereas privatisation of dozens of small state-owned businesses haspassed off with little controversy, the sale of the crown jewels, inthe form of ZCCM, is a different matter, not least because Mr Kaunda isback on the campaign trail, preparing to contest next October'spresidential elections.United Nations Conference on Trade and Development figures, publishedlast month in the World Investment Report, estimate an inflow of morethan Dollars 350m in new foreign investment since the 1991 elections.In the last year a number of multinationals have returned to, orexpanded operations in, Zambia by buying state-owned companies.The list includes Tate & Lyle in sugar, Unilever and HJ Heinz in foodprocessing and toiletries, the Commonwealth Development Corporation incement and agriculture, South African Breweries in brewing and AngloAmerican in hotels.The net result is that Zambia attracted more foreign investment in1991/94 than any other sub-Saharan country, except oil exportersNigeria and Angola.Nevertheless, the announcement of ZCCM's privatisation just monthsbefore elections may seriously damage the prospects of Mr Chiluba'sMovement for Multiparty Democracy.The past four years of structural adjustment have been extremelypainful, with falling per capita incomes, rising unemployment, highinflation and interest rates and plummeting industrial production.That all of this was necessary to turn around an economy brought to itsknees by 27 years of mismanagement by Mr Kaunda's United NationalIndependence party (UNIP) may count for little when voters come to casttheir ballots.Economic reform would have paid dividends far more rapidly had theprivatisation programme, now beginning to show real results, beenimplemented both sooner and more efficiently; had the country not hadtwo droughts; and, most important, had the copper mines been able toexploit a period of strong demand and high prices.Figures for the first nine months of 1995 point to copper output ofabout 325,000 tonnes this year, down 8 per cent on 1994 and less thanhalf the average of over 700,000 tonnes a year in the late 1960s.In cost of production terms, ZCCM is in the top 10 per cent of globalproducers. Competitiveness will deteriorate further when costs grow asNchanga nears the end of its economic life, and the industry suffersfrom the cumulative effects of undercapitalisation, inadequate skills,reinvestment and maintenance spending, and weak management.If all goes to plan, Konkola will be developed as a joint venturebetween the government, whose contribution is likely to take the formof providing already existing smelting and refining capacity - therebyfurther weakening the rump of ZCCM itself - and a Anglo-led consortium,which may take some 60 per cent of the equity in the scheme.While such an arrangement makes sound commercial sense, it will leaveMr Chiluba open to the criticism of privatising ZCCM by stealth.An agreement in principle to develop Konkola, however, will reassure anincreasingly restive donor community.The response from the finance minister, Mr Ronald Penza, struck anequivocal note, speaking of the need for 'the utmost caution' inprivatising the mines.'We must have the necessary political support,' he said - which wasinterpreted by some donors as political shorthand for more delay.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:SRI LANKA'S WAR EUPHORIA FADES   By AMAL JAYASINGHE in Colombo   COLOMBOThe euphoria that erupted when Sri Lanka's military scored asignificant victory last month over separatist Tamil rebels in theirnorthern stronghold of Jaffna has sharply diminished with steep priceincreases coming into effect in the New Year to pay mounting war bills.President Chandrika Kumaratunga yesterday promised to press ahead witha carrot-and-stick strategy to end more than two decades of ethnicviolence which has claimed more than 50,000 lives.'The economic cost of the war will have an all-round effect in terms ofhigher prices,' Mr GL Peiris, deputy finance minister, said. 'This is awar for peace, so there is no question that we have to find theresources for it.'The government estimates that the war against the Liberation Tigers ofTamil Eelam (LTTE) will cost Dollars 760m (Pounds 495m) this year, upfrom a provisional Dollars 640m in 1995.The seemingly unending fighting was felt by the tiny Colombo StockExchange, which shed 33 per cent of its value during 1995. Amid fallingforeign reserves, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 8 per centagainst the dollar in 1995.Yesterday the government lifted a ban on local banks raising capitalabroad, in an attempt to reduce domestic interest rates, which lastmonth galloped to 105 per cent amid a cash flow crisis.It is also raising telecommunications charges by 20 per cent, bus faresby 50 per cent and electricity tariffs by 20 to 100 per cent, dependingon the rate of consumption.However, Mr AS Jayewardena, the central bank governor, said theeconomic picture should improve in 1996, with foreign capital inflowsexpected to rise with the sale of state enterprises.The government is hoping to attract Dollars 420m in foreign capitalfrom privatisation, including the sale of the telecommunicationsoperator and the national airline, AirLanka. The projections areconsidered too optimistic by private analysts.Government politicians said the rising prices and the government'sfailure to turn the military success into a political victory hadturned initial enthusiasm into despondency.Despite the fall of Jaffna, the Tigers have shown that they are stillable to carry out spectacular guerrilla attacks using suicide bombers.Army camps and convoys have been targeted by lone Tiger guerrillasladen with explosives.Tamil men, women and children who fled the fighting in Jaffna aresheltered in areas of the country's north still under rebel dominance.The Tigers say they will not allow civilians to cross over togovernment-held areas of Jaffna.Defence analysts say that eventually the guerrillas will have to allowcivilians to return home because that would help the Tigers to go backto Jaffna and revert to hit-and-run attacks against the army.The military on the other hand is ill-equipped to supply its35,000strong force in Jaffna because all land routes to the region aredominated by the rebels. They depend on the minuscule air force and thenavy.Mr Anuruddha Ratwatte, deputy defence minister, said the army wouldsoon open a land route to Jaffna. It would mean a fresh offensive thatwould cost many more lives, officials said, and the army was alreadybracing for it.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:ZEDILLO RESHUFFLES CABINET   By DANIEL DOMBEY in Mexico City   MEXICO CITYA year to the day after he lost his finance minister in the fall-outfrom Mexico's botched devaluation, President Ernesto Zedillo last weekmade further changes to a government still struggling with theunpopularity unleashed by the currency crisis.Mr Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, who as energy minister was criticised forlinks to the old guard of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party,has been replaced, along with Ms Norma Samaniego, the country'scomptroller general, who was thought to be keeping too low a profile toget to grips with Mexico's allegedly rampant corruption. Mr CarlosSalomon, the head of Mr Zedillo's press office and frequent target ofcomplaints about the administration's news management at times whenspeculation about government changes unsettled the peso, has also beenremoved.The alterations leave key economic posts unchanged and do not indicateany big shift in strategy. While the new energy secretary, Mr JesusReyes Heroles, spent much of the previous administration of PresidentCarlos Salinas advocating a more interventionist economic approach, thenew comptroller general, Mr Arsenio Farell, helped push through thewage-labour pacts that then provided the centrepiece of economicpolicy.Mr Zedillo's supporters claim the alterations draw a line under thepolitical difficulties of the government's first year and set the stagefor further reform. But other observers deem the changes a tardyreaction to months of persistent criticism of Mr Zedillo's team.'This is a defensive move. It does not take the initiative as a morethorough going reshuffle would have done,' said Mr Juan Molinar, apolitics professor at El Colegio de Mexico, a graduate researchinstitution.Mr Zedillo does not face a nationwide electoral test untilcongressional elections due in 1997. But he can ill afford a repetitionthis year of 1995's election results, which saw the main right-wingopposition party establish control over roughly a third of localgovernment, and win three of five governorship elections.With the government predicting an economic recovery of only 3 per centgrowth this year after a fall of 7 per cent in 1995, Mr Zedillo's newappointees will find themselves the focus of added attention in theirtasks of managing the government's relationship with the press,reducing bureaucratic profligacy and reforming and attracting newinvestment to the country's energy sector.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:POOREST DEPEND ON BENEFITS 'FOR 70% OF INCOME'   By GRAHAM BOWLEYThe poorest 20 per cent of households get almost three-quarters oftheir income from state benefits, government statisticians have found.Cash benefits made up 70 per cent of the gross income of the bottomfifth of Britain's households in the last financial year (1994-95),according to the Central Statistical Office's latest survey of economictrends.Taxes and government benefits trebled the share of total income of thepoorest 20 per cent of households, the study shows.Their share of total UK income grew from 2.3 per cent before taxes andbenefits to 6.9 per cent after taxes and benefits.Before tax, the top fifth of households earned 20 times more than thelowest fifth but only four times as much after taxes and benefits.The top 20 per cent of households paid 19.6 per cent of their grossincome in income tax compared with 11 per cent paid by otherhouseholds.State pensions accounted for almost three-quarters of the cash benefitsreceived by retired households, the study finds.The distribution of income before tax is more equal among those stillat work than those who have retired.But the distribution of after-tax income is more equal among retiredthan among working households.The CSO gives, for the first time, a regional breakdown of grossdomestic product and investment. This shows that in 1994 - the latestyear for which complete figures are available - the south-east, home to31 per cent of the population, accounted for about 36 per cent of GDP.The north-west, which was the second most productive region, produced9.9 per cent of the UK's total GDP.Northern Ireland accounted for the lowest proportion of GDP at 2.3 percent.The south-east also had the highest GDP per capita at Pounds 11,407 perhead - compared with the UK average of Pounds 9,768.The lowest was Northern Ireland where people earned Pounds 8,027 perhead and Wales where the figure was Pounds 8,274.But this gap is narrowing. Growth in GDP per head has been higher inNorthern Ireland than any other region since 1990.Income from employment was the source of more than 65 per cent of GDPin Scotland, whereas it accounted for less than 61 per cent in EastAnglia and the south-west.Economic Trends, No. 506, Central Statistical Office, Great GeorgeStreet, London SW1P 3AQ.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:GLOOMIER PROSPECTS PREDICTED FOR THE ECONOMY   By GRAHAM BOWLEY, Economics staffA gloomier outlook for the UK economy emerged today with a leadingforecaster predicting that growth will slow in 1996 and a poll whichshows that business confidence is at its lowest since 1992.The latest report by Cambridge Econometrics, the economic consultancy,says a slowdown in the rest of the world will depress Britain's exportsthis year.It says companies will also cut output as they try to sell the stocksthey built up in 1995.As a result, UK gross domestic product will grow by less than 2.5 percent in 1996 compared with 2.75 per cent in 1995. This predictionclashes with the official Treasury forecast of 3 per cent growth thisyear.But growth will rebound in 1997 to 2.8 per cent, the forecasting groupsays. It thinks spending by consumers will grow modestly in 1996 andthen expand strongly next year - due partly to tax cuts in the nextBudget.Meanwhile, a survey of 2,000 businesses published today by Lloyds Bankshows that confidence is at its lowest level since the poll began in1992. For the first time the survey shows an increase in thosebusinesses reporting cashflow prob-lems and a slowdown in exportorders.Orders for goods and services continue to grow - but at the slowestrate since the second half of 1992. The poll shows that confidence hasdropped as economic growth has been disappointingly slow.Mr Michael Riding, the director of commercial banking at Lloyds Bank,said that although companies 'are still experiencing growth, they arehaving difficulty in coming to terms with managing in a low inflationeconomy. This, coupled with failed growth expectations, has made themsomewhat pessimistic - possibly unnecessarily'.Companies in the construction and retail sectors reported the slowestgrowth in orders, while manufacturing companies and hotels and cateringbusinesses reported strong growth.Companies told Lloyds Bank that investment spending has slowed becauseof slower profit growth and increased pressure on cashflow. However,Cambridge Econometrics predicts that investment will pick up in 1996 asthe private finance initiative fills much of the gap left by cuts ingovernment capital spending.The forecasting group says there is evidence of a build-up in stocks inthe motor vehicle, chemical and non-metallic mineral productindustries.It predicts that headline inflation will fall in the short-term inresponse to lower mortgage interest rates although the underlying ratewill remain broadly unchanged.In the longer term, headline inflation will rise to 3.7 per cent in1997 from 3.1 per cent currently.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:WALDEGRAVE RESOLVES TO START EARLY: NEW YEAR AIMS INCLUDE PUSHING THEPFI AND TACKLING FRAUD   By ROBERT CHOTELike the arrival of Christmas in the shops, negotiations between theTreasury and government departments over public spending seem to getearlier every year.The detail of the last public spending round was published only a monthago, at the time of the Budget. But Mr William Waldegrave, the chiefsecretary to the Treasury, is already preparing for the openingskirmishes of this year's battle.Mr Waldegrave said in an interview with the Financial Times that heplanned to emulate his predecessor, Mr Jonathan Aitken, by looking atthe spending of larger departments in spring, before the hagglingproper gets under way.The Department of Social Security will come under particular scrutiny,according to Mr Waldegrave. Its Pounds 90bn budget next year will beWhitehall's largest by far, so it is bound to be an important target inany search for savings.'It is essential that they are feeling the full force of thepossibilities of new ways of doing things,' Mr Waldegrave said. 'PeterLilley has exciting things to say about how benefits can be deliveredin a few years' time. What the Treasury has to see is whether 'a fewyears' time' can be made any shorter.'Mr Waldegrave has been criticised by some MPs for allowing too big anincrease in the DSS's running costs during the last spending round. Buthe argues that some cuts have actually cost money by weakening controlof the benefit system.Mr Waldegrave said it was clear that the proportion of social securityclaimed fraudulently - estimated at between 5 per cent and 10 per centfor some benefits - was much larger than most observers had thought.He noted that a pilot scheme to issue some claimants in London withswipecards was already saving money. 'One of the things I have to doearly in the new year is see what is a practicable, do-able,non-fantastic programme here which might generate another few hundredmillion,' he said.Mr Waldegrave said there was also scope to push the private financeinitiative, which attracts private sector funds and expertise intopublic sector infrastructure projects.'One thing we have broken the back of this year is institutionalresistance to the PFI, although it only generates a saving for publicexpenditure in terms of delivering better value for money,' he said.Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, believes thateconomic activity may be slowed in the short term by an 'infrastructurehiatus' as private finance replaces direct public funding. But MrWaldegrave said he expected private money to be attracted more quicklythan the Treasury assumed in the Budget.There were no 'wonder drugs' which would deliver savings fromgovernment spending next year, Mr Waldegrave added. He ruled out theidea of taking a tougher line with the Department of National Heritagebecause of the extra revenue from the National Lottery.But Mr Waldegrave admitted he was attracted - although this was apersonal rather than a Treasury view - to the idea that artsorganisations could be funded through endowments. This would limit thecentralisation of public support for the arts, although it would notnecessarily save money.Mr Waldegrave said that in framing a long-term strategy for publicspending, it was unrealistic to aim for the low government shares ofnational income achieved in some Asia-Pacific countries.Nations such as the US, New Zealand and Switzerland were better rolemodels, implying a government share of national income of 35 per centor 36 per cent. Public spending stands at 42 per cent of nationalincome, compared with the formal target of less than 40 per cent.Mr Waldegrave said every chief secretary had the ambition of reaching astage where it was no longer necessary to hold public spendingnegotiations every year. He said it was worth investigating the ideathat departments could agree a tough settlement on the understandingthat their budgets were guaranteed for a number of years. But heconceded that departments would fear that a future chief secretarywould not feel bound by the pledge.So the annual ritual of the public spending negotiations remains withus. Every year departments will squeal about the pressure they areunder, and the chief secretary will proclaim one of the toughest roundsin living memory.Robert ChoteBack to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:TORIES WARN OVER NICHOLSON ATTACKS   By JAMES BLITZ, Lobby CorrespondentSenior left-of-centre Conservatives yesterday warned the government totone down its attacks on Miss Emma Nicholson, the MP for Devon West andTorridge, following her defection to the Liberal Democrats last week.As her decision to quit the Conservatives continued to inflame thelong-running battle between leftwing and rightwing Tories, Mr PeterTemple-Morris, the MP for Leominster, condemned the 'torrent ofpersonal abuse' being heaped on Miss Nicholson - arguing that thecriticisms were not helping to settle pro-European Tory MPs in the wakeof her defection.In recent days Mr Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, hasclaimed that Miss Nicholson's departure followed her repeated andunsuccessful attempts to gain a ministerial post within the government.Mr Michael Portillo, the defence secretary, compounded the criticismyesterday by arguing that Miss Nicholson had 'demonstrated a history ofdisloyalty' - in part by deciding to vote against Baroness Thatcher inthe 1990 Conservative leadership contest.However, Mr Temple-Morris, a Euro-enthusiast who, ironically, is oftenassociated with Mr Heseltine's cause, warned that the attacks on MissNicholson were further damaging party morale.'If someone does defect from the party, then that is bad enough withoutpersonalising things,' he said. 'But ministers are creating a situationin which the public probably has some sympathy with her.'Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, attacked the language withwhich Mr Portillo had castigated Miss Nicholson, insisting thatministers needed to understand why she had made such a move.'This is what I regret, that members of the cabinet should be indulgingin this sort of language and this approach,' he told BBC Radio 4'sToday programme. 'We should be making sure that other people who haveanxieties should have those anxieties removed so the public should seewe are not a bitterly divided party, that we have pulled ourselvestogether and can work together.'Ministers were yesterday hoping that the circumstances of MissNicholson's move were exceptional and would not be followed by furtherdefections.But party whips will be heeding the recent claim by Mr Hugh Dykes, theMP for Harrow East, that a further six Tories could defect toopposition parties before the next general election. Mr Dykes, one ofthe most staunchly pro-European of Conservatives, will have his everymove watched closely by Tory whips in the next few months.Others whose names have been speculated upon as possible defectors areMr Temple-Morris; Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East; SirKeith Speed, MP for Ashford; Mr George Walden, MP for Buckingham; andMr Tim Rathbone, MP for Lewes.None of these has been prepared to admit that he is seeking to move toanother party. However, two of them - Mr Hicks and Mr Walden - haveindicated dissatisfaction with the direction of politics at Westminsterby announcing that they will not be standing at the next generalelection. Sir Keith Speed is also standing down at the next election.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:SALES SUCCESS LESS SWEET AS CHEWERS AVOID SUGAR   By JOHN AUTHERSConsumers tried to cut down on their sugar in 1995, according to theannual survey for the chocolate and sweets markets carried out byCadbury-Schweppes, the confectionery company.While Nestle's Kit Kat bar consolidated its lead over the Mars Bar -perceived as more fattening - in the chocolate market, the most popularsweet was Wrigley's Extra, a sugar-free chewing gum.Total consumption of chocolate declined slightly compared with 1994,from 530,000 tonnes to 526,000 tonnes, a trend which manufacturersattributed to the hot weather during the summer. But total spending onchocolate reached a new high of Pounds 3.2bn.Kit Kat's sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 200m while those of Mars,fell 2 per cent to Pounds 150m.A report in June by Datamonitor, the market research company, said KitKat's share of the chocolate snack market had stayed at about 17.4 percent between 1990 and 1994, while the Mars Bar's share had dropped from16 per cent to 11.7 per cent.Mars made changes to its product last year in an attempt to appeal towomen and to make its bars seem less fattening, introducing bite-sizedversions and changing the recipe to make it taste lighter. Cadbury'sDairy Milk consolidated its place as the third most popular chocolate.In the market for sweets, Wrigley's Extra gum finished ahead of Polomints and Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles, according to the annual review byTrebor Bassett, the sugar confectionery division of Cadbury's. Orbit byWrigley, another sugar-free gum, came fourth, well ahead of the betterknown Wrigley's Spearmint, which was 17th.The total size of the market was less than half that for chocolate,with total sales of Pounds 1.4bn and 283,000 tonnes sold. Averagespending per capita for the year was Pounds 24.The hot summer weather also affected sales of sweets, which includecough lozenges in the top 20, according to Trebor Bassett. But itadded: 'There remains enormous future potential for market growth - westill have quite a way to go before we match the per capita consumptionfor sweets of our European neighbours.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:FIAT STEPS UP DRIVE FOR IMPORT POSITION   By JOHN GRIFFITHSFiat Auto UK is restructuring its dealer networks as part of a campaignto regain its status as one of the UK new car market's biggestimporters.The company is reorganising its 220-strong Fiat dealer network andincreasing its Alfa-Romeo dealerships by 25 per cent.The moves strengthening the dealer networks come as the Italian group'swholly-owned UK subsidiary prepares today to launch its Bravo and Bravamodels. They are intended to challenge Ford's Escort, Vauxhall's Astraand other similar-sized models in one of the biggest sectors of the UKnew car market. Fiat spent more than Pounds 1bn developing the newmodels.The new models appear set to return the Fiat brand to the 4 percent-plus market share levels not seen since the early 1980s. Mr JamesBlades, Fiat Auto UK's managing director, now expects final figures toshow Fiat's market share in 1995 reached 3.6 per cent, with total salesapproaching 75,000 when about 3,000 Alfa-Romeo sales are included.Fiat's UK market share peaked in 1979 at 4.9 per cent, with sales ofLancia models at the time lifting the group's share above 5 per cent.Yet for much of the 1980s Fiat's share slid downwards, mainly becauseof the parent group's failure to invest in new models. By 1992 it hadslumped to less than 2 per cent.So poor were Lancia sales that Fiat has stopped importing them to theUK altogether, while sales of Alfa-Romeo - bought by Fiat in 1987 -currently represent less than 0.2 per cent of the UK market.However, the launch of two small cars, the Punto and Cinquecento, hasalready brought about a strong revival. Mr Blades said: 'We are nowworking hard to ensure that further growth is stable and sustainable.That means making further inroads to fleets so as not to be subject tothe whims of private buyers.'Fiat's concern in this respect is illustrated by Society of MotorManufacturers and Traders statistics showing that the total new carmarket in the UK grew 2 per cent in the first 11 months of 1995. Yetwithin this total fleet demand grew 7 per cent whereas sales to privatebuyers have stagnated.The importance of the fleet sector to manufacturers and importers isunderlined by the fact that around 47 per cent of new cars in 1996 areexpected to be bought by fleets.Fiat's sales to fleets in 1995 played a big part in its outperformanceof the new car market overall. At 67,400 Fiat's total sales in thefirst 11 months were 20 per cent higher than in the same period in1994, compared with only a 2 per cent rise in the UK new car marketoverall. Within the total, however, sales to fleets have jumped 43 percent. The importance of Bravo/Brava to Fiat's further UK growth isunderlined by the fact that the model segment in which they willcompete accounts for more than 30 per cent of the fleet market.Under the dealer restructuring, Fiat is retaining the overall size ofthe network at about 220 dealers but replacing many of the smaller,less committed outlets with facilities owned by the bigger retailinggroups. As a result of the shake-up, now in its final stages, some 30per cent of the network is owned by members of the UK's top 100retailing groups which are capable of making the substantial investmentthat Fiat wants to see.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:CRITICS TURN ON TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY: AS THE IRA CEASEFIRE HASLITTLE EFFECT ON PREMIUMS, BUSINESSES QUESTION THE EXISTENCE OFREINSURER POOL RE   By RALPH ATKINSWhen the IRA bombed the City of London in 1992 and 1993 causing morethan Pounds 1bn in damage, businesses were thankful anyone was preparedto provide insurance against further attacks.With insurers set to exclude unlimited terrorism cover from commercialpolicies, the setting up of Pool Re - a state-backed 'reinsurance'company which would underwrite policies sold by conventional insurers -was seen as a sensible response.Nearly three years later, as many companies renegotiate policies duefor renewal, the mood has changed.Pool Re is criticised as expensive and inflexible. The Association ofInsurance and Risk Managers, which represents commercial insurancebuyers, reckons the high rates Pool Re charges are forcing companies tochoose between spending large amounts on terrorism cover - or riskgoing without.The IRA ceasefire has had a limited impact. Premium rates have fallen:a 20 per cent discount has been announced for next year. Pool Re alsocollects only 60 per cent of the policy premium at the start of theyear; the remaining 40 per cent is waived if total claims during theyear do not exceed a certain level (Pounds 75m in 1996).But terrorism cover used to be included in standard commercial propertypolicies at no additional cost. As Mr Leslie Lucas, Pool Re chiefexecutive, admits: 'Any policyholder is going to say that, if we oncehad it offered for nothing, any price is going to be too much.'There is also concern that the structure of Pool Re is preventing thedevelopment of an alternative terrorism insurance market.Because Pool Re started in 1993 without any capital, it had to operateas a mutual, pooling the resources of those who depended on itsservices. It insists member insurance companies only sell terrorismcover at rates and on terms set by Pool Re. Premiums are pooled into aninsurance fund which at the end of 1994 stood at Pounds 410m but islikely now to be substantially higher. Because most insurers are PoolRe members, companies have little option but to buy Pool Re policies.Moreover, corporate groups cannot 'cherry pick' - buying insurancepolicies backed by Pool Re only for vulnerable properties. Apart fromsmaller sites, they have to buy cover for all or none.Rates are set according to formula varying by location. There is onlylimited scope for taking account of measures individual companies mighttake to reduce their exposure to terrorist attack.Mr Alan Gavaghan, deputy chairman of insurance broker Willis Corroon,says: 'A lot of companies spend a lot of money on risk preventionaction, not just things like sprinklers and shatter-proof windows. Theyhave put a lot of thought into it, but they are treated in the same wayas people with clapped out warehouses.'Alternatives are available. Willis Corroon is one of five brokers whichcombined to provide terrorism insurance underwritten by syndicates atLloyd's of London which are not Pool Re members.Last month the facility was improved and policies paying out up toPounds 100m per terrorist attack are available. That means largecompanies could choose to insure just their most vulnerable properties.But the total amount of insurance coverage available is limited. Pricesmay also not be sufficiently attractive for companies to switch fromPool Re policies which provide unlimited cover. As Mr Jeremy Lowe, ofWillis Corroon, says: 'It is a viable alternative to Pool Re for thosewho want to be selective, rather than a competitor.'In spite of its criticism, the Association of Insurance and RiskManagers do not want to kill the idea of a pool.'The concept is a good one,' says Ms Ina Barker, executive director.'The premiums of the many pay for the claims of the few.' There is alsolittle sign that insurers and reinsurers are willing to return toproviding full terrorism cover without state back-up.The association's idea is that Pool Re should be funded by a flatcontribution, or levy, on all commercial property policies.

As fundsare built up by Pool Re - assuming there is no escalation of terrorism- there would be scope for contributions holidays.Potentially, Pool Re could evolve into a state-backed reinsurerproviding cover against other perils where the incidence is low butpotential costs could be catastrophic - London flooding is a possibleexample.The aim would be to achieve the basic principle of insurance -spreading big risks on the shoulders of many.

Mr DavidHarris, a Conservative MP whose constituency includes the Newlynfishing port, said yesterday that Spanish access to the Irish Box wouldinevitably lead to further cuts in quotas, hurting the UK fishingindustry.Mr Harris said he had written to Mr John Major, the prime minister,arguing that more control of fishing zones should be handed back toindividual European Union member states, rather than regulated by theEuropean Commission through quotas.'The end result is going to be massive over-fishing of stocks alreadyunder pressure,' he said.Yet Mr Tony Baldry, the fishing minister, said that Spanish boats wouldnot be able to catch any additional fish by choosing to trawl in theIrish Box, rather than in other areas.'They will be policed equally fiercely on the catches that they take tomake sure the fish are the proper size and are within quota, as much asensuring that there are no more than 40 trawlers at any one time in theIrish Box,' he said.The two men also disagreed about whether Spanish boats would abide bythe rules of the agreement to use the disputed waters.Mr Harris predicted that Spanish trawlers would use 'every trick in thebook' to skirt the rules, while Mr Baldry argued that the Spanish boatswould comply.'It will be a very stupid Spanish skipper who seeks to break therules,' said Mr Baldry. 'If he does so he will be brought into court,he will be prosecuted and he will be fined up to Pounds 50,000.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:BIG THAW LEADS TO WATER CUTS: UK NEWS DIGESTThousands of homes throughout the UK were flooded and whole communitiesfaced water shortages yesterday as the Christmas freeze gave way to adramatic thaw, bursting water mains and domestic water systems. In someareas, temperatures soared from -20C to around 7C.In Scotland, 1/2m Strathclyde homes suffered burst pipes at some pointover the holiday. Water rationing was introduced in parts of NorthernIreland as reservoirs ran low because of water leaks and burst pipes.More than 100,000 homes were affected and water tankers were being usedin some areas.The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which is responsible for publichousing, dealt with more than 5,000 calls. Plumbers ran short ofmaterials and the executive had to arrange special openings of supplystores to allow work to continue. Vast quantities of water were lostbecause affected schools, factories and offices were closed for theholidays.Thousands of consumers in the Carmarthen area of west Wales spentyesterday without water because of a burst main taking supplies fromthe river Towy. North West Water brought in extra staff to cope withphone calls, and other areas affected by the thaw includedNorthumberland, Tyneside and Wearside, East Anglia, Essex, and Suffolk.Thames Water said customers were cut off at various times but teamswere working to restore services. Press AssociationSCOTTISH BANK HOLIDAYS'Drop January 2' plan attackedScottish nationalists yesterday attacked plans to bring Scottishbanking industry holidays into line with England. The move could makethis the last traditional new year holiday period north of the borderand set a precedent for other employers, warned Ms Anne McNair, theScottish National party's employment spokeswoman.Scotland has two new year bank holidays - January 1 and January 2 -whereas England and Wales have only January 1.Announcing SNP backing for a campaign by the main banking union Bifu,she said: 'Once again it seems that Scottish families and society aretaking second place to English clearing banks and the London StockExchange. Making Easter Monday a bank holiday instead of January 2, asis proposed, would make no sense since demand for banking services isfar greater at Easter than at new year.'

PressAssociationBack to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:NERVES BEGIN TO FRAY OVER BUDGET IMPASSEIt is probable that the US government will still not be fullyfunctioning again this morning - and it is not possible to ignore therising tide of public and personal disgust with the wilfulness of thoseon the right wing of the US Congress who have brought about this prettypass.Note, from the outset, where the finger of blame is pointed: not atPresident Bill Clinton, though he may have contributed to the overallbudget impasse and is reaping political benefit from it; nor at SenatorBob Dole, though the majority leader might have been more resolute instanding up to his party's vizigoths if he did not need them for hispresidential ambitions.No, responsibility lies squarely with those so convinced of their ownrectitude and so insulated from the real world outside theirconservative salons and support groups that they cannot understand thedamage they are doing - not only to those affected by the longest, ifpartial, closure of the federal government ever, but also, ultimately,to their own cause of balancing the budget in seven years.It is doubtful that the impact of the suspension of government businesswill lop more than a fraction of 1 per cent off GNP. Importantindustries and cities have not ground to a halt because 280,000 federalbureaucrats have been laid off. No college football game, the opiate ofthe New Year season, has been cancelled.There has been damage, however: to the civil servants, not exactly fatcats, unpaid for two weeks over Christmas; to small federal contractorsdependent on government; to the 20,000 people who apply for passportsevery day and the 23,000 who register with social security; and to thesmall towns and businesses that live off the seasonal trade of greatnational parks like Yosemite in California, where the adjacent MariposaCounty has declared itself a disaster area.They may not amount to a collective blip in the national statistics,but their livelihoods are affected - for months ahead - and all aresome politician's constituents. To judge by their comments in streamsof US media interviews, they are mostly mad with what they frequentlycall 'the clowns of Congress', and soon some poll will doubtlessmeasure their anger.Perhaps more serious for the congressional right is the offence theyhave given to the chattering classes, who, when aroused, can still domuch to shape public opinion. Nothing has offended them more than thedenial of unfettered access to the most comprehensive collection everassembled in one place of the works of Johannes Vermeer, the Dutchmaster, at the National Gallery here in Washington.Last week, Rusty Powell, the gallery's director, was able to open itsdoors by releasing Dollars 30,000 from a private donor fund earmarkedfor future exhibitions. This was enough to make the Vermeers - but notthe rest of the formidable standing collection, nor the concurrentWinslow Homer exhibition - available to the public. And did they come,with lines in frigid weather stretching round the block for preciouspasses.But the money is only good for a week, which means that unless Congresscomes up with funding for the gallery pronto, the Vermeer exhibitioncannot complete its scheduled run until next month. And, like the smallbusinessmen in Mariposa County, just about all the gallery-goers havevented their spleen at Congress. One angry TV commentator suggestedthat, as a punishment, the 73 Republican freshmen in the House ofRepresentatives be permanently barred from looking at Vermeer'smasterpieces (though the impact of such contemplation might well besalutary).A more severe critic could go further by noting that few of theaffected are natural allies of the hard right. Art appeals to the eliteand is often decadent; passports are for foreign travel and thussomehow un-American; social security is for the weak; national parksmight be more profitable if opened up for oil drilling and commercialexploitation; and Washington itself, a veritable modern Sodom andGomorrah, would be better off turned into a pillar of salt.The last word should lie, surely, with the bureaucrats. While they areon unpaid furlough, members of Congress are receiving their salarycheques and, as is their wont during recess, travelling the globe. So agroup of US diplomats in Latin America ordered back to work to arrangeone such six-nation trip, sent this distinctly undiplomatic message tothe state department:'Frankly, we are disturbed by the thought that while American schoolchildren are being turned away from Smithsonian museums, nationalparks, monuments and memorials, some members of the US Congress arelooking forward to seeing exotic attractions like Copacabana, Iguazu,Cuzco, Macchu Picchu and Otavalo - largely at the expense of theparents of those school children.'Perhaps they should push the congressional delegation off a cliff, inthe manner of the Incas.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THIS MILLENNIUM COMMISSION?   By ANTONY THORNCROFTWhat, exactly, is this Millennium Commission we keep hearing about? Thebody set up to plan the UK's celebration of the year 2000. Most othercountries hope to let off a few fireworks but the UK is taking it veryseriously indeed, and spending about Pounds 1.5bn.Whose idea was it? Lord Palumbo, former chairman of the Arts Council,thought the millennium a good excuse to spruce up Britain's nationalheritage - Stonehenge, the cathedrals, that sort of thing, and perhapsadd one or two modern landmarks. Prime minister John Major agreed, andPalumbo's idea has gathered great momentum.Organised by a quango of the great and the good, presumably? Spot on.Seven worthies, mixed to reflect the aristocracy, business, heritagelobby, science and women, plus a couple of politicians (VirginiaBottomley and Michael Heseltine) who are charged to give to it avote-gathering twist.Where on earth is the money coming from? From the UK national lottery,now a little over a year old. Projects to mark the millennium are oneof the five worthy causes that are getting great chunks of lotterycash, along with the arts, sport, the heritage industry and charities.To date the Millennium Commission has received almost Pounds 300m. Butunlike the other good causes, its good fortune ends on December 311999. After that, its share of the lottery cake will be divided amongthe other four.Hasn't the commission upset the Welsh? Yes, some of them. It wasdecided to spend about Pounds 600m on 12 landmark projects, the 20thcentury's gift to the future. These are to be spread conscientiouslyaround the UK. Wales was owed one, but the national rugby ground atCardiff Arms Park, and a proposed opera house for Cardiff Bay, eachapplied for Pounds 50m. Forced to choose between the two Welshpassions, rugby and music, the commission said 'No' to music and'Maybe' to rugby. The money will probably be spent refurbishing CardiffArms Park.So all this millennial cash is not spreading universal happiness? Noway. There are as many people whingeing as celebrating, especially inthe media. The commission is accused of being short on big ideas andlong on cautious pragmatism. It has imposed severe restrictions bydemanding that applicants should be able to provide half the cost ofany project, although some of this can be in land or labour. This makesthings hard for imaginative loonies.But some good must be coming from it? Well, the Tate Gallery is happy.It has Pounds 50m for its proposed gallery of modern art on Bankside;Kew Gardens has Pounds 21m for a millennium seed bank for plants; andPortsmouth Harbour picked up Pounds 40m to convert itself into theworld's classiest marina. Scotland has been sweetened with Pounds 46mfor a 'new' Hampden Park. These are among the landmark schemes.But I live in Twistelton-on-the-Marsh. I'll never get along to thesenational monuments. The commissioners have also set aside anotherPounds 600m to engender turn-of-the-millennium optimism at the grassroots. Over 300 groups of local activists have already received a goahead for good ideas. For example, there will be a new village hall forIngleton in Derbyshire, thanks to a millennium grant of Pounds 150,000;a coastal railway linking the Giant's Causeway and Bushmills inNorthern Ireland will please locals and tourists, at a cost of Pounds700,000; and Pounds 588,000 has been set aside for salmon ladders inthe River Thames.Strengthening communities and greening the land are buzzwords thecommissioners have taken to heart. The Pounds 42.5m for Sustrans, whichaims to cover the nation with 2,500 miles of cycle paths, just aboutsums it all up.What is going to happen in 2000? Good question. No one knows, althoughImagination, a group of creative whizzkids from London, and M2000,financed by Touche Ross and MAI among others, should have a good idea.They are the two consortia short-listed to organise the year-longcelebration, likely to be a cross between the Festival of Britain andDisney World. The winner will be chosen this month. Four sites havealso been short-listed: Greenwich, near London; the National ExhibitionCentre near Birmingham; Derby; and Stratford, in London.Greenwich, the chosen venue of M2000, is favourite, while Imaginationhas plumped for Birmingham.It depends whether the commissioners go for a site in London plumb onthe international dateline, or Birmingham, near the centre of the UK.With Pounds 100m of millennium money to oil the profit-making event, itshould be some celebration.And on December 31 2000, is it all over? The commissioners hope not.There will be the landmark buildings to enjoy, although there is noequivalent to the Crystal Palace or the Eiffel Tower on the horizon toamaze citizens of 2096. There will also be hundreds of village halls,urban parks and small woodlands.And there will be some bursaries, which are planned to continue adinfinitum. What are they. Can I have one? No reason why not. Thecommission is setting up a Pounds 100m endowment, which should produceabout Pounds 5m a year to be distributed in dollops of Pounds 2,000 andupwards to citizens who want to improve themselves, and then pass onthe improvement to their communities.More details will be announced this month, but you will probably haveto apply to a charity or a voluntary organisation for vetting.

But thedeal is also noteworthy in that it will form one of the foundations fora new phase of growth and capital investment at BP, whose lastexpansive foray triggered a debt crisis in 1992 and the departure ofRobert Horton, former chairman and chief executive.That episode still influences the thinking of John Browne and that ofSir David Simon, BP's chairman and the man who engineered the recoveryof the company's fortunes. 'We must not leverage this company everagain,' said one senior executive last week.But the company says a cautious approach to debt does not mean that BPis afraid to act decisively to ensure future growth. It has embarked onbig oil and gas projects in politically unsettled parts of the worldsuch as Colombia, Azerbaijan and Algeria.Such projects are a marked departure from BP's traditional core areas -Alaska and the UK sector of the North Sea. But during Browne's tenureas head of the company's upstream arm, the board came to accept thatpolitical risk is best spread across a range of projects in differentcountries. 'The real risk is having too much in one basket,' says oneBP executive, 'not in going to risky countries which could have amaterial effect to the company's bottom line.'Browne also placed emphasis on the 'phased development' of suchprojects. That allows the company to limit its financial exposureduring the early stages of a project, when there is likely to begreater uncertainty about whether it will prove technically,politically or commercially viable.Industry observers say Browne's greatest success was in re-shaping thestrategic direction of the exploration arm and ensuring that it had astring of possible projects to choose from. It now has sufficientassets to ensure that reserves can be replaced for another 10 years.That means that while many other oil companies hunt for new reserves,BP can focus on projects that are likely to offer the highest return.Yet analysts wonder whether Browne will have equal success tackling theproblems in BP's downstream division, the one part of the company ofwhich he has no direct experience and a sector in which big changes mayhave an impact on BP's customer base.He has recently devoted time to downstream issues, in particular to thefuture of the company's refineries. They, like much of the industry,suffer from thin margins and offer little scope for any technologicaladvantage over competitors. An announcement on the furtherrestructuring of the company's refining assets is expected this month.Browne, an engineer who believes technology can continuously enhanceBP's financial performance, is upbeat about chemicals - a segment inwhich proprietary technology can increase competitiveness and thedivision that BP has chosen to lead its expansion in Asia.An announcement on broader corporate aims is expected in March. Therehave been rumours in the industry that Browne has contemplated radicalchanges to the way BP conducts its business, with some observersspeculating that Browne, a former corporate treasurer, would like toadopt more of a 'merchant bank' approach to the industry.BP executives say he is more likely to maintain a step-by-stepapproach, and emulate Simon by setting simple targets related to BP'sfinancial and performance ambitions.One of his biggest challenges will be to maintain BP's strong financialperformance. 'You can grow from an uncompetitive base by cuttingcosts,' says one executive. 'The hard task is to grow from acompetitive base, and not just capture the chemicals cycle at its top.'That means BP will have to focus on efforts to keep margins as high aspossible even in a downturn.Browne's strategic aim is to create a 'distinctive' company - one withelements that competitors would have difficulty copying and one whichwould provide unusual financial returns to investors. He emphasises theimportance of relationships with host governments, partners andsuppliers.Browne also wants a 'unique' set of assets, including markets. But bigacquisitions of the type that landed BP in so much trouble in the pastappear to have been ruled out for now, although executives say BP willcontinue to make small-scale acquisitions.Browne's first six months have been made easier by BP's strongfinancial performance. But in future there is likely to be greaterinvestor interest in how he and his colleagues deal with the narrowerissues of the downstream assets and with capital investment decisions.Senior BP executives say investors are right to demand the highestcapital efficiency possible. After all, says one, 'the industry as awhole has a pretty bad track record. It hasn't spent money wisely.'What of BP specifically? 'We should expect to withstand toughscrutiny,' he says. 'But I don't believe BP will repeat the past.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:FILMS FOR 1996   By NIGEL ANDREWSYou can always tell a new movie year. It stomps into view overturningChristmas trees and growling 'No more Mr Nice Guy'. 1996's firstaudiences are invited to choose between Seven (serial killer withhorrific murder methods), The Kingdom (ghoulies in a haunted hospital)and Four Rooms, which climaxes with Quentin Tarantino presiding overchopping a finger.Nevertheless, there are compensations to be found. The faint heartedcan take refuge in France's The Horseman On The Roof - more buckle andswash from director Jean-Paul Cyrano De Bergerac Rappeneau - and inSomething To Talk About, a marital comedy-drama with Julia Roberts. Shetwangs a pretty southern accent while Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlandsprovide power casting as Mom and Pop.In truth, even the nasties are not that nasty. The Kingdom, a weirdlyhilarious TV mini-series turned four-hour movie from Danish directorLars Von Trier, is more black comedy than spine chiller. And there ishumanity between the stomach-testing moments in Seven. Brad Pitt andMorgan Freeman play detectives sleuthing through a series of murderspatterned after the seven deadly sins.The moral is, if you want quality cinema you must take the rough withthe smooth. But you need not take Four Rooms at all. This quartet ofstories proves there are days when even wonder children like Tarantinoshould be locked in the nursery until they get the script right.On video, meanwhile, two films allow you to be adult and childlike atthe same time. Ed Wood is Tim Burton's funny-elegiac homage to theworld's greatest 'bad' director, with Martin Landau eating the sceneryas the horror actor Bela Lugosi.And Dianne Wiest similarly eats the scenery in Woody Allen's splendidshowbiz comedy Bullets Over Broadway.

And what was thebest/most enjoyable/most instructive business book you read in 1995?On this page we print seven answers to these questions.Sumantra Ghoshal, professor of strategic management at London BusinessSchool:Challenge: Over the past few years many companies have focused onrationalisation and restructuring. Often this has requiredfragmentation of their organisations into small units and some radicaldecentralisation. Now, with much of the fat out of the system, thechallenge will be to reintegrate their fragmented organisations topursue new growth opportunities.Book: The Boundaryless Organisation by Ron Ashkenas, Dave Ulrich, ToddJick and Steve Kerr (Jossey-Bass, San Francisco).This is a wonderfully practical and down-to-earth book that is bothidea-rich and implementation-focused. It provides insightful ideas,clear examples and simple tools - a rare combination in the world ofbusiness publications.Gerry Robinson, chief executive, Granada Group:Challenge: Not to run out of steam. The 1980s was a period of hugegrowth and expansion through new markets, new technology and a globalview of business. The 1990s have been dominated by cost control, costcutting, streamlining and tighter management control in order tomaintain profitable growth. This must not become the main role ofmanagement - we must also use creativity, enthusiasm, leadership andsound strategic direction to improve a company's health and growth.Book: I have to confess that I did not read any business books at alllast year. This is not because I feel I have nothing to learn aboutbusiness but because I did not find the time.The most important book I read last year was unquestionably Wild Swansby Jung Chang (HarperCollins). Reading about China's culturalrevolution is more enlightening and satisfying than reading about thecorporate revolution.I am a strong believer in broadening the mind in spheres other thanbusiness.Tim Simpson, managing director, Arthur D Little:Challenge: 'Seventy per cent of all re-engineering projects fail',people will tell you, misquoting one of the big change gurus. My viewis not so pessimistic. Many companies have made large-scale change workfor them, and their performance has jumped as a result.But with the recovery faltering, and markets ever opening to worldcompetition, sustaining this performance improvement will be themanagement challenge of 1996.Book: 1995 was again notable more for books I wanted to read than thoseI found time for. But one which did hit home was the Fifth DisciplineFieldbook, by Senge and friends (Nicholas Brealey Publishing). Ease ofreading is one attraction - it's written for browsing and providesusable suggestions on almost every page.And its central proposition - that learning, and particularly teamlearning, is a key part of building competence in companies - isintuitively obvious. The book goes further, suggesting practical waysto manage the learning process and build competence faster. And itcomplements Senge's earlier, more theoretical work, with much morepractical experience.Peter Sutherland, chairman and managing director, Goldman SachsInternational:Challenge: To cope with the effects of globalisation. Within a veryshort time the world has decisively changed and management willincreasingly be required to focus on opportunities in, and challengesfrom, the emerging markets that will provide much of the economicdynamism for the world into the next millennium. An understanding ofrelatively familiar cultures and relationships will have to beaugmented by an under-standing of relatively different environments.Book: I am not proud to admit that I have virtually never read businessbooks (unless written by Sir John Harvey-Jones). In 1995, however, Ihave read some that I would recommend.The first of these is Corporate Level Strategy by Goold, Campbell andAlexander (Wiley), which looks at managing multi-business companiessuch as GE, ABB and Canon.My second and third books are not business books per se but I recommendthem because, in today's world, a good manager has to be tuned in todramatic political change in terms of national sovereignty. AndrewMarr's Ruling Britannia (Michael Joseph) is about more than Britain.It is about a world in transition. One doesn't have to agree with allhis conclusions to find his opinions both provocative and relevant.I would also include Where Did We Go Wrong - From the Gold Standard toEurope (Faber & Faber) by the remarkable Eric Roll, who analyses pasterrors in policy relating to the British economy and, above all, toBritish negativism towards European integration.Adair Turner, director-general, Confederation of British Industry:Challenge: Growing. British businesses have got very very good over thepast 10-15 years at being lean and mean, at increasing productivity.They need now to get better at investing for the long term, atmarketing, at creating new products. A stable economic climate shouldmake this possible.Book: Not business but economics, and not one but two. The State We'reIn by Will Hutton (Cape). Disagreed with lots of it and almost gave upafter the first two pages of polemic, but provocative and insightful ifyou persevere. And The World in 2020 by Hamish McRae (HarperCollins),crystal-ball gazing with insight.David Wellings, chief executive, Cadbury Schweppes:Challenge: The same as always. Putting forward the best face possibleon the past in order to attract investors; scanning the latest mountainfor that elusive and obstacle-strewn path to shareholder value; andensuring that managers of vision, tenacity and stamina are there tostep in when you eventually fall off the mountain.Book: Neville Bain's Successful Management (Macmillan Business). Sound,practical advice from a businessman to businessmen. Blessed relief fromconsultants peddling the latest irrelevant buzzword for keeping inshape 'corporate re-engineering' or motivation 'empowerment'.George Yip, adjunct professor of strategy at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA):Challenge: Multinational companies will continue to face in 1996 thechallenge of globalisation and of building global capability.A successful global company today needs the capability to access and totransfer anywhere in the world technology, ideas, factors ofproduction, and other sources of competitive advantage.In this regard the biggest challenge will be moving executives aroundthe world in the face of escalating costs.Book: Strategic Alliances: An Entrepreneurial Approach to Globalizationby Michael Y. Yoshino and U. Srinivasa Rangan (Harvard Business SchoolPress).Strategic alliances are a major method for globalisation and this isthe best book I have read to date on the international aspects of thissubject.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS FEATURES:A PRODUCT OF POETRY: RUPERT MORRIS WONDERS HOW FAMOUS VERSE COULD BEUSED IN ADVERTISINGReaders of the Management Page may have noticed that Union Bank ofSwitzerland has been using poetry in its advertisements.'Thoughts that transcend time from Union Bank of Switzerland' haveappeared on global satellite and cable channels, featuring Sir JohnGielgud and others reading classic poems like Ozymandias, Ulysses andso on.The poetry was chosen, according to project manager VincentoTravaglione, to embody corporate values of 'responsibility, openness,courage and perseverance'.Of course, there is nothing new about poetry in advertising. In theearly years of this century, we were regaled with gems like these: TheOnoto, the Owl and the Waverley pen, They come as a boon and a blessingto men . .Or the following, proclaiming the attraction of Everybody's, a popularmagazine of the inter-war years: Oh Mr Porter, whatever shall I do? Iwas reading my Everybody's and got carried on to Crewe] Copy-writingwas in its infancy in those days, I suppose, which may explain whythese excruciating verses lasted for several years; and yet they wereprobably extremely effective, imprinting themselves on the popularconsciousness in much the same way as the catchiest pop songs.Nowadays, alas, advertisers are more image-conscious. You can't imaginethe Body Shop using some naff rhyme, can you? Ovaltine is thehonourable exception, resurrecting the delightful song of those 'happygirls and boys', the 'Ovalteenies'.But Advico Young and Rubicam, the Zurich agency which dreamed up theUBS campaign, have been doubly smart. Not only have they regaled TVviewers with some decent poems for a change, subtly enhancing theirclient's image; they have also done it on the cheap by using authorswho are long out of copyright.There is no end to the number of commercial interests that mightbenefit from a quick glance through the Oxford Book of English Verse.Brewers, for instance, need look no further than AE Housman. Indeed,Ind Coope should surely consider funding an AE Housman chair of poetryat its Burton-on-Trent headquarters.No modern copy-writer could improve on this passage from A ShropshireLad: Say, for what hop-yards meant, Or why was Burton built on Trent?Oh many a peer of England brews Livelier liquor than the Muse. And maltdoes more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. Ale, man, ale'sthe stuff to drink For fellows whom it hurts to think.Your AB audience might blench somewhat at the last line, butself-conscious intellectuals are not usually beer drinkers anyway, so Idon't think we need worry.Haircare has been a fruitful medium for advertisers, and yet one doesfeel that there is a certain creative vacuum in this field.Purveyors of hair bleach must despair of that stubborn group ofindependent-minded modern women who refuse to emulate the models withflowing locks on their screens and become bottle blondes. Perhaps theyshould try a touch of Wordsworth: Earth hath not anything to show morefair  .And if that doesn't work, there's always Eliot: Stand on the highestpavement of the stair - Lean on a garden urn Weave, weave the sunlightin your hair On reflection, this verse might be more appropriate forwigmakers. But that's the joy of poetry as an advertising medium. It'sso flexible.Other products and services might not be so easy. It is certainly timethe army came up with something better than that macho stuff with younglads driving tanks, swimming, skiing and and generally behaving likewould-be contestants on Gladiators. How about something that brings outthose unchanging values of selfless patriotism? The Soldier, by RupertBrooke, has the right combination of gravitas and romanticism. But thatfirst line is a bit of a downer: 'If I should die . .' You might aswell make it a commercial for funeral services.Now there's a thought. Undertakers have been loath to advertise up tonow, but poetry might give them just the opportunity they need. Thewords of the American Stephen Vincent Benet spring to mind: You maybury my body in Sussex grass, You may bury my tongue in Champmedy, Ishall not be there, I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at WoundedKnee.At Berry & Birnam we always respect the wishes of the departed. Organrefrigeration a speciality.

Not since I filled my body with astrange orange liquid at the start of the festive season. The incidentwas quite out of character and the memory of it leaves me feelingsheepish and puzzled even now. Lest you conclude that I went wild onthe mandarin liqueur, I should assure you that my liquid was imaginaryand that it has made me calmer, unflappable, ready for the new year.The bizarre story began when a lady named Deborah Marshall-Warrenoffered me a free trial of something called Orange Liquid Therapy. Shesaid this was a 'mental de-tox' session that involved hypnotism, deeprelaxation and direct suggestion to sooth all my stresses away. Halfwayround the bend with pre-Christmas strain at the time, I felt willing totry anything. When she told me her practice was in Regent Street, thatclinched it: I could sort myself out and do some Christmas shopping aswell.Yet when I arrived at her office, I started to feel uneasy. There wasan unnatural calm about Ms Marshall-Warren. Her eyes were red and shelooked as if she had been crying for weeks. We sat in a tiny cubicle ashot as the Sahara and lit by a large bright globe. 'I'm going to putyou under quickly', she said. Obediently, I sat in the chair and triedto relax. I looked at the spot on her hand. I closed my eyes. 'Feelyour calves filling with a warm, orange liquid', she crooned. 'It issoothing, tingling, and it is moving, up, up into your knees. Feel yourknees filling with a warm, orange liquid. It is soothing, tingling. Itis moving, up, up into your thighs . .' You get the picture.When I was full to the brim with orange liquid, I had to imagine itscrubbing out my cares, fears, anxieties, fizzing and dissolving themin much the same way that Domestos gets to work with stubborn householdstains. Then, when there was no more work for it to do, I was told topicture it slowly draining out through my fingers and toes. Clean andemptied, I was informed that I was feeling lighter, more confident,better able to cope and happier.Set down in black and white, orange liquid therapy sounds daft as abrush. I am constitutionally opposed to New Age nonsense. I do notbelieve in trendy miracle cures for complex problems. The sort ofstress relief that makes sense to me is to work less, drink less or togo on holiday.So imagine my bewilderment to find myself feeling much better after 45minutes of semi-conscious sloshing around in make-believe colouredfluid. Before entering the cubicle I felt tense, on the verge ofhysteria. Afterwards I was cheerful, unbothered even by Oxford Circusin the rain at rush hour, and more or less equal to Christmas.Yet when I tell my friends and colleagues my wonderful hypnotism storythey give me a wary look. As far as they are concerned, I've started ona slippery slope, and soon I will be pushing all kinds of dubiousmanagement gimmicks. I insist I am still the same person. They are notso sure. We shall see.1995 was the year in which the re-engineering craze died. Areplacement, developed by McKinsey and explained in the consultant'slatest quarterly bulletin is called: Do It, Then Fix It. I like thisnew fad more than the old one, because it comes in words of onesyllable. The idea behind it is equally hard to argue with: companiesshould work out what changes to their business need to be made, thenthey should carry them out without more ado. Once done, they shouldassess the result, and if it has flaws, they should swiftly put themright. Indeed, this seems to be such a sensible way of going aboutthings, it is a mystery to me why companies need McKinsey to spell itout to them.In the middle of all the change that companies are supposed to beundergoing, one thing remains constant: workers feel their bosses donot have their best interests at heart.Never mind all the empowerment, teamwork and egalitarian structures,employees take the same dim view of their managers as they always havedone. According to actuaries Watson Wyatt, less than half believe theircompany is well managed, or think that their bosses make the rightstrategic decisions.The only thing that has changed in recent years is that workers nowview their superiors as hypocrites: good at drawing up a set of valuesfor the company, less good at living by those values themselves.I realise it is not for me to volunteer new year's resolutions forothers, especially as I have not made any for myself. But might it notbe time for senior managers to start practising what they preach? Iused to think that human behaviour was difficult to change, inparticular that old dogs could not be taught new tricks. But now I amnot so sure. Dare I recommend a little hypnotherapy? On second thoughtsit would only work if they wanted to change. And that, surely, is theproblem.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:HOTELIER'S STARCK CHOICE: IAN SCHRAGER'S HOTELS ARE FOR THOSE WHO CANAFFORD CHINTZ BUT WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SAYS ALICE RAWSTHORNOn paper, Ian Schrager looks like the sort of self-indulgentbusinessman who is rather too self-indulgent for his own good.He did, after all, fly 80 palm trees from Washington to the Delanohotel he opened in Miami last summer, because they were more attractivethan the local crop. And, after taking a closer look at the sand onnearby Miami Beach, he shipped in a ton-and-a-half of a superiorvariety.Yet Schrager is not just another architecture junkie who allowsaesthetic excess to cloud his business judgment. He can rattle off theprofit margins on almost every aspect of the Delano and of his threeNew York hotels. He has harnessed his love of design to turn them intothe hotels of choice for what he calls 'the generation that wantssomething different' - artists, actors, designers and musicians who canafford four-star or five-star establishments but find them ratherboring.The three New York hotels - the Royalton, Morgans and the Paramount -are almost always fully booked. The Delano in Miami is so popular thatlast month's American Vogue prefaced an article on other Miami hotelsby saying: 'If you can't get into the Delano . . . .'. Schrager is nowrenovating the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles and searching for a sitein London.The progress of his business career has been erratic, to say the least.He made his name in the late 1970s with Studio 54, a New York nightclubthat he ran with his university roommate, the late Steve Rubell. Studio54 captured the hedonistic spirit of the late 1970s. But in 1980Schrager and Rubell were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for taxevasion.After their release they opened a nightclub, the Palladium, anddiversified into hotels. Neither had any experience of the business,but they knew what sort of place to open. 'There was no point inopening another luxury hotel,' says Schrager. 'That end of the businesswas well served by Claridges in London, the Bel Air in LA and theCarlyle in New York. They serve room service course by course atClaridges. You can't beat that.'They sensed a need for a new type of luxury hotel for the sort ofpeople who used to go to Studio 54 - people who wanted, and werewilling to pay for, the comfort and service they got in conventionalluxury hotels, but would prefer a less formal setting more in tune withtheir taste than the chintzy interior of Claridges.They started by renovating Morgans, a discreet mid-town hotel with 154rooms built in the late 1920s. Schrager commissioned Andree Putman, theFrench designer, to refurbish Morgans in her understatedly elegantmodernist style, but they were more adventurous in their choice ofdesigner for the next hotel, the Royalton, which they entrusted to theflamboyant Frenchman, Philippe Starck. Schrager worked with Starckagain on the Paramount, an equally extrovert but less expensive hotelthat opened in 1990.Each of the New York hotels has its own character. The Royalton is themost audacious. The Paramount is for people who love the Royalton butcannot quite afford it. And Morgans is the most discreet. Schragerensures there is a difference of at least Dollars 50 (Pounds 32)between the room rates: Dollars 250 for the Royalton, Dollars 200 forMorgans and Dollars 100 for the Paramount. They all have an averageoccupancy rate of more than 90 per cent, against the US industryaverage of 71 per cent.'Coming from the nightclub business was great training for running anhotel,' says Schrager. 'You're selling a commodity product. A nightclubsells the same drink and plays the same music as the competition. Theonly thing that differentiates them is production values. It's the samewith hotels.'Production values are Schrager's forte. Starck, with whom hecollaborated on the Delano's all-white interior and Alice In Wonderlandgarden, is prodigiously talented but notoriously difficult to workwith. Schrager's solution is to set up a project management team ofarchitects, art directors and buyers to implement Starck's ideas andbring them in on budget.'After doing three hotels with Philippe, we know what to expect,' saysSchrager. 'We don't panic when we get these weird faxes from him.' Thissystem has produced some of Starck's best work. He is one of theworld's most sought-after designers who receives three or four requestsa month to design hotels, but says 'no to all of them, except Ian'.All Schrager's hotels look expensive. The fittings are speciallycommissioned and the renovation budgets seem high - Dollars 28m for theDelano, Dollars 35m for the Royalton, Dollars 60m for the 610-roomParamount. But Schrager is careful to buy existing hotels which will beeasy to convert. 'We replace everything, even the plumbing, but leavethe rooms intact. You can get into trouble by banging on walls.' Hesays it would cost 'much more' to kit out his hotels in conventionalchintz than in a sumptuous Starck design.His latest project is the Mondrian in Los Angeles. It was purpose-builtas a 1960s apartment hotel and is now being redesigned by Starck, whosays he wants it to be 'very, very white with one or two symbols ofcolour' to emphasise the 'dreaminess of LA'. Schrager has asked artistJames Turrell to create a 'three-dimensional living art piece' for thefoyer 'so it will be like walking into an artwork.'As his hotel chain expands, Schrager has cut costs by pooling areassuch as purchasing and marketing. He is careful to concentrate on roomrental, and licenses out services such as bars, restaurants and gyms.Brian McNally, who has turned the Royalton's '44' into one ofManhattan's most chic restaurants, runs the Delano's Blue Room with popstar Madonna as a co-investor. Schrager even licenses the newsstands.'When we ran the newsstand at the Paramount, it lost Dollars 1,000 amonth. We've given it to a guy who knows the business and it makesDollars 4,500 a month.'The Mondrian is scheduled for completion in October and Schrager willthen expand outside the US. He has hunted for sites in London withoutsuccess, although Granada's hostile Pounds 3.3bn bid for Forte couldcreate some opportunities.'My customers travel on a certain axis,' says Schrager. 'New York,Miami and Los Angeles are on it, so are London and Paris. You couldn'topen hotels like mine just anywhere because there wouldn't be enoughpeople to fill it. And I'd put as much effort into a place with 17rooms as I would into one with 700.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996OVERSEAS NEWS:BANGKOK GETS TOUGH ON MOTORISTSMore than 100 people were arrested on the first day of a campaign byBangkok police to force motorists to heed traffic regulations as partof an attempt to unsnarl the city's gridlock.In Bangkok, known for the world's worst traffic jams, drivers routinelyflout the rules. Violators often slip the police small bribes and areswiftly on their way.Car sales in 1995 are expected to have topped 500,000, making Thailandthe largest car market in south-east Asia. But only 8 per cent ofBangkok's land surface is covered by roads, compared to 25 per cent inNew York and Paris. Short trips in the city can take hours.Bangkok's traffic problem is affecting the city's development. Someforeign businesses have decided to locate elsewhere, and tourists spendless time and money in the capital, citing their aversion to thetraffic. The campaign is part of a plan by Thaksin Shinawatra, abillionaire businessman and deputy prime minister, who was elected lastJuly on a pledge that he would solve Bangkok's traffic problems in sixmonths or resign. Thaksin's deadline - January 26 - is approaching withno noticeable improvement in traffic conditions.However, the World Bank recently announced it will provide a Dollars150m (Pounds 97m) loan to Thailand to help alleviate its trafficproblems. Maurice Le-Blanc of the bank said: 'The government ofThailand has taken a leading role in the region in addressingenvironmental and road safety issues in an aggressive manner, which todate have proved very successful. This will further those efforts.'* For those who can make it through the traffic, Bangkok's firstCyberpub has just opened, providing a focus for the party-lovingafter-work crowd. For Dollars 12 an hour, customers can sit at one of10 glass-topped tables equipped with a Compaq Presario.Getting into the spirit of things, an opening night trio of womenclicked on to a virtual dating service which bills itself as 'Your linkto true love'. As the picture and vital statistics of a young hunk fromNew York appeared on the screen, one adjusted her glasses and took acloser look.The Cyberpub is in the same ownership as the local upmarket Dusit Thanihotel chain.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:POBOX AND THE MAGIC COOKIEWhich company will have the greatest effect on the development of theInternet this year? My answer is neither Microsoft nor Netscape. It isa tiny new company in Philadelphia called Pobox. com - spelt as if itwere an abbreviation of Post Office Box, but pronounced as the singleword 'Pobox'. Its product consists of a simple forwarding service thatis an electronic equivalent of a post office box.The system works as follows. Customers give out an e-mail addressending in pobox. com - like the one that appears at the bottom of thiscolumn. When their friends or colleagues send them e-mail at thataddress, a computer in Philadelphia looks up the recipient in a database and forwards the message immediately to their Internet provider.This service allows people to give out an e-mail address that isindependent of where they work or where they choose to buy Internetaccess. Moving from one Internet provider to another is simply a matterof sending a message to pobox. com giving a new forwarding address andquoting a 'magic cookie', a number that establishes the customer'sauthenticity.I have already discovered an advantage of the service. Having recentlymoved from London to Silicon Valley in order to work on a book, I haveswitched Internet providers. But my address has remained the same, andmessages sent to me as if I were in London are forwarded to me inCalifornia without my having had to tell anyone how to reach me.Yet people moving house are not the sole market. Other potential usersincludes customers of CompuServe, which allows people to use only anindecipherable string of numbers as their e-mail address.Equally attracted will be those who are embarrassed by the cumbersomelength or strange letter-and-number combination of their real e-mailaddress.The entrepreneurs behind Pobox. com are a pair of students at theUniversity of Pennsylvania, still living in a college dormitory: ReuvenBell, 23, whose subject is religious studies, and Meng-Weng Wong, 21, acomputer science major born in Singapore. The two launched theirservice in early 1995, and already have 3,000 users. In keeping withthe principle that most of the best Internet businesses start off bygiving things away, the pair offer a generous free trial lasting threemonths.Thereafter, the price for forwarding mail starts from Dollars 15 ayear, payable by credit card - with the incentive of six years for theprice of five to those who choose to pay Dollars 55 in advance.Three months is exactly right for the trial period. It is long enoughfor customers to become comfortable with the service and to give theirnew e-mail address to all their friends, but not long enough for anyoneto find it worthwhile to start again with a new name from scratch.So far, 850 electronic invoices have been sent out, and almost halfhave been paid. Because of a glitch in the billing software, Bell andWong have not yet had time to send out reminders. But early indicationsare promising, and the pair claim that an automated trawl of Internetnewsgroups has turned up more than 1,000 mentions of their service,only one of which was negative.Whether Pobox. com will make serious money or not is too early topredict. Its founders certainly hope so. Bell has just taken time offfrom his degree to work on the business 12 hours a day, and is planningto pursue some Wharton MBA courses on his return to academia. Moreover,the company already has imitators: a sign, surely, that others see thepotential in its idea.Even a modest success could have a sharp effect on the Net. It wouldremove the fear of changing e-mail address that forces many to staywith an unsatisfactory service provider. In doing so, Pobox. com'ssuccess would make a large global industry significantly morecompetitive.* Talking of magic cookies, someone recently sent me the followingstory by e-mail. A woman who had eaten a delicious cookie at the cafeof a department store in Dallas asked for the recipe. 'We don't give itout,' said the waiter. However, the customer persisted and offered topay for the recipe.On hearing that the price would be 'two fifty', she agreed to charge itto her credit card along with the bill for her lunch, and was thenhanded the recipe on a printed sheet. Thirty days later, her Visastatement revealed she had been charged Dollars 250.The furious cookie lover called the company's head office, thinkingthat the real figure should have been Dollars 2.50, but was told therewas no mistake.The Dollars 250 was to insure that not just anyone could afford therecipe. Accordingly, her request for a refund had to be turned down,but the woman got her own back in the end.She copied the recipe into an e-mail, which she posted to all herfriends. They posted it to their friends, and they in turn to theirs.'I paid for it,' her e-mail said, 'so you can have it for free.'I find it hard to imagine that the department store named in the e-mailwould behave in such a pig-headed way.But even if apocryphal, the story illustrates the power of theInternet. By the time you read this, tens of thousands of people mayhave baked cookies according to the recipe without paying Dollars 250.And the name of the store chain will have been blackened on computerscreens all over the world.

Home shopping, that supposedlytrail-blazing benefit of interactive television, has fallen out of itssupermarket trolley.Less than a year ago the pundits were predicting a couch-potato futurefor us all. Sitting comfortably in front of our screens, we would surfthe stores and trawl the malls. Never again need we venture into therough, tough world of Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. We wouldclick-on, cruise-thru', and our cyber-shopping trollies would be filledby techno-magic.Well, it hasn't happened yet. But is it on its way?The picture is confused as there are two types of televisual homeshopping. First, conventional satellite/cable channels offeringmerchandise in a fairly traditional way. Second, shopping emporia -mostly American - are burgeoning on the Net.The more knowledgeable US home shopping gurus have long been suspiciousof the forecast explosion in their marketplace. QVC, America's largest,highest profile home-shopping channel, mostly sells jewellery (42 percent of its turnover) and clothing (18 per cent). For clothing, thereturn rate is about 40 per cent.A couple of years ago QVC's then retiring chairman, Joseph Segel, saidin a notable speech: 'The number of people tuned to a particularchannel when your advertising runs is likely to be a small fraction ofthe number you could reach with direct mail. The cost of running ashopping channel is much greater than most people realise. Some systemdevelopers and their software programmers assume that consumers areitching to be converted from passive to interactive TV viewers.Certainly there are some people who fit that mould. But I venture tosay that the great American public prefers just to watch television andlet someone else do the work.'In turn, futurologist John Naisbitt's well-informed Trend Letter - apublication understandably keen to embrace almost anything andeverything new under the sun - recently asked: 'Is the much-hyped ageof online shopping about to bloom? Not really.' The same issue of TrendLetter reported that 'merchants on the Internet are reluctant tosolicit credit-card numbers for payment, lest hackers steal accountnumbers' - a little cybernetic difficulty that has by no means beenresolved.Nonetheless, research estimates suggest that 2m online purchases weremade in the US in the last year. That sounds an awful lot until youremember that it equates to a single purchase by less than 1 per centof America's population. And Americans, particularly those living wayout nowhere, have always been catalogue shoppers, so direct marketinghas always been big business in the US.It is a far-flung country, and even with gasolene as cheap as Coke itdoesn't make a lot of sense to drive hundreds of miles for a rubbergrommet. In other words, established home shoppers may just beswitching media, from print to Net - without new shoppers beinginveigled into the couch-potato lifestyle.Where Americans are slow to lead, Europeans are even slower to follow.At the end of 1994 a study of the multimedia marketplace in Europecarried out by leading research group Inteco reported that the demandfor home shopping was non existent. 'No one in the study,' itproclaimed, 'showed any interest in being able to order goodselectronically.'The progress of home shopping in Britain confirms that. QVC startedwith a bang in the UK but sales appear to be stabilising at aboutPounds 50m annually - not a lot with which to run a full-time channeland supply some 300,000 customers.Part of the reason for this disappointing growth is the result, Isuspect, of the hype attached to the phrase 'virtual reality'.Televisual shopping, it is claimed, provides 'virtual reality'. In avirtual reality supermarket you can whiz round the aisles picking up apack of this and a jar of that as you skid past the shelves. It soundsso futuristic, so clever, that we have been seduced into believing itwould be wonderful. But would it?It would certainly be fun once or twice, like a video game. But we allknow what has happened to the sales of video games. The problem is thatvirtual reality really doesn't bear much resemblance to reality.We encounter reality through our five senses: sight, sound, smell,taste and touch. So-called virtual reality offers reality in - at best- two dimensions: sight and sound. Sight is the most important singlesense involved when we go shopping. But it is not the only one.As supermarkets are well aware, smell is all-important. That is whythey put fruit and vegetables at the front of the store, and bake theirown bread. For many products, touch is as important as smell. ('If youdon't want the goods, don't muck 'em about', went the oldcostermongers' injunction, to restrain customers from manhandling theproduce).Paradoxically, it is in the area of sight that virtual reality is leastreal. If Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, believes that projectinghuge cyber-blowups of great masterpieces on to his walls will conveyeven a tad of their artistic merit, it is as well he never tried tomajor in aesthetics.But never mind great paintings. Would you even buy fresh meats or fish,or even fruits and vegetables, without seeing them in the flesh? Ifpeople didn't want to inspect the goods carefully and choose thefreshest, why would they shop at the deli counter? The newest Tescostores now have large old-fashioned butcher's sections. And if you wantto inspect groceries before you buy them, why not shop for the lot atone stop?Apart from groceries, the sector that has generated most chatter amongthe marketing classes - but again, little action so far - is cars. (Themarketing classes are not much interested in jewellery - not in sellingit, anyway).Automotive gurus constantly predict that the end of the showroom isnigh: motorists, it is said, will compare and contrast different modelson-screen before selecting their test-drive short-list. And one day,even the test-drive will be taken on-screen.The assumption is that video information is more appealing to motoriststhan printed or personal (showroom) information. Maybe. But feel,comfort, guidance - even smell - are important reasons for showroomvisits, and cannot be duplicated by 'virtual reality'.Which may explain why the only area in which home shopping seems to betaking off is one in which virtual reality is virtually non-existent -the marketing, not of goods, but of services, particularly financialservices.As financial products are, so to speak, invisible and intangible, theyare ideal for telephone selling. While financial service providersincreasingly use direct response television advertisingcost-effectively, their commercials could hardly be described asvirtual reality. Or indeed, in many cases, as reality of any sort.Not that home shopping is not going to grow. It will, but it will beslow and highly specialised. Delivery takes time and costs money. Manypeople, perhaps most, will never feel comfortable with computers.Forget those middle-class parental boasts of brilliantly sophisticatedcomputer-literate kids; think, instead, about all the underprivileged,computer-illiterate kids.Nor is home shopping quite as revolutionary as cyberbuffs believe.Almost exactly a century ago the Victorians were opening up their ownversion of the information superhighway (and with at least as muchhyperbole). The UK postal service, the railways, the telephone and thetelegram were bustin' out all over. Telegrams were described - as newmedia so frequently are described by their sponsors - as 'the boldestadvertisements in modern times.'By the turn of the century, all the great London department stores hadmail-order departments. Harrods, which pioneered home shopping bytelephone, rejoiced in the telephonic address EVERYTHING, LONDON.Whiteley's in Bayswater boasted they could supply anything 'from a pinto an elephant' door-to-door.And the Army and Navy store sped huge mail-order catalogues to itscustomers in every corner of the globe, carrying within their covers acornucopia of sumptuous and succulent merchandise. Moreover, deliverywas often a good deal faster and cheaper than it generally would betoday.Home shopping may yet be the bonanza of the future. But I wouldn't betmy Tesco shares on it.Winston Fletcher is chairman of the UK advertising agency DelaneyFletcher Bozell.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS FEATURES:KICKING OFF THIS US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR* Kicking off this US presidential election year, the Doonesbury TownHall site ( www. doonesbury. com/ main. html), based on Garry Trudeau'sconsistently brilliant strip cartoon, looks a fine way of keeping tabson the campaign as it unfolds.

Traditionally, the pro has received a small retainerfrom his club but earned the bulk of his living selling equipment andgiving lessons.Yet selling equipment to club members is becoming virtually impossibleas the tiniest of retailers strives to compete against specialist chainstores such as American Golf Discount and Nevada Bob's.'The members don't realise what a financial strain it is to carry thestock on a big overdraft and they can be such fickle customers,' saysHaydn Darrell, the pro at the small Devon club of Sidmouth. 'I'll seethem turn up to play with a new set of clubs and I won't even have hadthe chance to match the price they've paid from one of the big chainstores.'Darrell's experience is echoed nationally. A recent report from thespecialist Golf Research Group predicted that the 2,400 retail outletssupplying the UK golf equipment market will have shrunk to only 200 to300 shops within a year or two.'The traditional pro shop just cannot survive,' says Colin Hegarty,head of GRG. 'The average gross turnover is around Pounds 110,000 ayear and they cannot stock the shop and survive on that kind ofvolume.'His figures show that the bigger retail outlets are growing fast, witha matching shrinkage at the smaller end. Hegarty says the club pro hastwo options: 'Get out of the business quickly: it's better to take abig loss than stay and starve to death. Or become an Alan Walker.'Walker is a former club pro - 10 years at the coalface - who realisedhe was a doomed species in a thriving industry, so he now has ahigh-volume shop adjoining his Warren Park driving range in Essex, plusa management company looking after a nearby pay-and-play course.Walker says that club pros have lost their retail business'frighteningly quickly. Five years ago it was a Pounds 130,000 averageturnover with a 35 per cent margin. That's all over.'His own shop turns over slightly more than Pounds 1m a year, but abranch of American Golf Discount has just opened on Walker's doorstep.'We're being hurt,' he admits. 'Teaching alone isn't the answer toreplacing lost income. Firstly, statistics show that the British arethe worst golfers in the world in terms of readiness to takeinstruction. Secondly, it's too seasonal. Who's having a lesson today?'He looked out of his office window as an arctic snow shower blastedacross the 14th green. Few issues currently occupy the ProfessionalGolfer's Association as intensely as the livelihoods of its 3,500members. As a result, a PGA working party is radically re-thinking theraison d'etre of the pro.It doesn't help that while the public image of the golf professional isNick Faldo or Ernie Els, superstars like those are a light year awayfrom the everyday work of the pro at the local club.When the PGA wanted a leading figure for a publicity campaign, it foundFaldo's fee unaffordable, so ended up using Nigel Mansell, one of thegame's better-known amateurs.Alan Walker is a committee member at the PGA and is deeply involved inthe process of reviewing future direction. As one experienced insiderput it: 'We have to stop training people for futures they are nevergoing to have. They're not going to be Woosnam or Norman, and nowthey're not going to be a successful shopkeeper, either.'Walker acknowledges the problems. 'At the end of the day we're allfailed players,' he says. 'I went into the game thinking I could playand was going to spend my days on the course winning tournaments, andI've ended up an accountant.' Later this month the PGA opens an Pounds8m training academy at its headquarters, The Belfry, the hotel coursein the English Midlands that has hosted several Ryder Cups.Leisure management and course architecture are much more important nowthan learning how to spend several hours repairing a persimmon-headeddriver for a tiny fee.The qualifications dished out at The Belfry will be equivalent to adegree. 'We've always been reluctant retailers, and the tour is for atiny minority, of whom 75 per cent won't cover their costs,' saysWalker. 'The jobs we've got to aim for are those of actually managingthe facilities, which in the past have gone to food and beveragespecialists or greenkeepers.'In the future, if your local club pro can't drive a computer and workthe local media, forget admiring his short game around the green.'If the pro can re-engineer himself to survive, what of the shop? We maynot buy much, but which weekend golfer doesn't enjoy a mooch around hisclub shop's over-stocked shelves?'It's history,' says Colin Hegarty. 'Marks and Spencer are alreadymoving into clothing in a huge way and the big chains will be sellingall the clubs and equipment.

For once, the old Englishsystem of independent representative groups of well-informedindividuals appointed by the crown to guide our affairs workedbrilliantly, with the millennium commissioners proving themselves worththeir salt by refusing to allocate national lottery money for theproposed Cardiff Bay opera house.For too long Lord Crickhowell and his opera house trustees have beenled by the nose by London architectural groupies and admirers of thedesigns of Zaha Hadid, who won the competition to design the proposedopera house.The common sense of the minister, Virginia Bottomley, and hercommissioners will save Wales the embarrassment of a design that is notsupported by the people of Wales and is already dated.A Cardiff Bay opera house as a new home for the Welsh National Opera isa good idea, and no doubt a large theatre will be built there. Themistake was for the opera house trustees to believe they had to buildsomething approved by a narrow segment of the internationalarchitectural mafia.The jury for the competition was unrepresentative and innocent,seemingly prepared to let Miss Hadid's quaintly modern period piece goahead even though she had never built a serious building. Miss Hadid isreally a talented futurist painter - her work would have been avantgarde in turn of the century Russia. Today it is labelled'uncompromising' and 'exciting'. It is neither. The trendy Londonchatterers who influence people like Lord Crickhowell should be seenfor what they are: rearguard types trying to protect a brieflyfashionable designer. But Miss Hadid is no genius.The tragedy of the inevitable row about Cardiff Bay is that the failureof Miss Hadid's design will be seen as a triumph for the philistines.It is actually a dated, awkward design that only got this far throughendless lobbying. The millennium commissioners, who distribute part ofthe proceeds of the UK national lottery, have called the bluff of thetrendies.Sensible opera house trustees should look at the newest opera houses inthe world; meet their architects and managers; and choose someone withexperience. The trustees must start again with a good new architect.Life is tough, but Virginia Bottomley is tougher, and in this case sheand her commissioners are right.Last year, national lottery money gave a fillip to the UK'sarchitectural profession. The turnover of the British constructionindustry should benefit by some 5 per cent or so in the years to themillennium. It is large-scale projects that attract attention, but some90 per cent of lottery grants are for projects of less than Pounds 1m.Yet 1995 saw construction still in recession and architects onlybeginning to see green shoots of recovery fertilised by lottery cash.The secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, belatedlyrecognised the value of towns. His new planning policy guidance notes,to be issued early this year, will stress the value of mixeddevelopments. That is an almost complete volte face for the entireplanning system. If he is serious, Gummer will presumably bere-educating the entire planning profession at the new University ofGreenwich.He will have to start with the Corporation of the City of London which,since the inspired but disastrous experiment of the Barbican, hasabandoned any pretence that the City is more than a Square Mile ofoffices. The recent announcement of two big office schemes in EC4, andthe decision to encourage Mitsubishi to go back to the drawing board onthe Paternoster site, means the City may be in danger of becoming ahorizontal version of Canary Wharf.The opportunity at Paternoster to build a mixed development, givingMitsubishi the chance to build as many offices as it likes on, say,London Wall, must not be missed. In turn, the chance to move the Museumof London to a marvellous site next to St Paul's should be grasped, andwhy not have hotels and residential accommodation overlooking Wren'swonder?Architects in 1996 need to learn to be different kinds of animals.Those like Miss Hadid and Sir Richard Rogers (imminent adviser to thenew Labour party) who are wedded to dogma, are now old fashioned.Architects like Sir Michael Hopkins, Sir Norman Foster and RichardMacCormac are the leaders of the profession, and also admired by thepublic.That is a breakthrough, and one that has come about because the publicare under-estimated by architects at their peril. The public - you andme - understands the difference between quality and a dead cow informaldehyde. Virginia Bottomley and her commissioners understand thedifference, too. In 1996, quality and common sense may replace dogmaand fashionable nonsense.

He opens and closes it inSalzburg, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic there later this month andreturning in December to rehearse Mozart's Mitridate for the 1997festival. In between there will be Berlioz with the LondonPhilharmonic, Dvorak in Boston, Henze in Basle, Elgar in Washington,Beethoven in Chicago, Nicholas Maw at the Proms and Brahms in Vienna -not forgetting three European tours with his own period-instrumentorchestra, the London Classical Players.Did someone say Norrington was a period specialist? If so, the periodranges pretty wide - from 1600 to 2000. That distinguishes him frommost early music pioneers. And he uses the same forensic skills tounravel Vaughan Williams and Part as he does for Beethoven and Bruckner- which sets him apart from other high-profile conductors. No Britishmusician has done more to challenge our assumptions or open our ears tothe past. At 61, Roger Norrington fully deserves the internationallimelight.He clearly enjoys it. The early music revolution, he says, is not aboutperiod instruments or a particular type of repertoire. 'It's a habit ofmind. Even if I didn't know anything about early music, I would stillbe the conductor I am now. I just can't look at a piece of musicwithout taking it back into the garage and stripping it down, findingwhat the hell is going on and putting it back together again. Vroom]'Earthy enthusiasm has always been a Norrington hallmark. It inspiredhis singers and orchestra at Kent Opera, where his 13 years as musicdirector gave him a vast repertory and an intimate understanding of howa company works. Enthusiasm has also been the key to his 'Experience'weekends, where he and the LCP discuss, rehearse and perform acomposer's work to the amused enlightenment of all. And it continues topermeate his day-to-day contact with conventional orchestras.'You don't often come across that kind of enthusiasm for the way themusic is realised,' said a member of the Basle Symphony Orchestra afterNorrington's latest visit. 'His contact with the players is amazinglylively - the orchestra had a great time. He got a humming performance,the music really took off.'Longstanding colleagues say Norrington has mellowed over the years. Hehas had two operations for cancer and become a father again: his wife,the choreographer Kay Lawrence, and their two-year-old son often travelwith him. 'But when it comes to the music, he's just as strict anddemanding as ever,' says an LCP stalwart. 'He has an incontrovertibleidea of how it should be. His point is that this is real music writtenby real people, and he gets that 'immediate' element across. He wantsto get round the traditional interpretation, demythologise the music,remove the waffle and ballast.'That is one of the reasons why Norrington now enjoys such a highprofile outside the UK. Long popular in the US and Italy, he has onlyrecently begun to make his presence felt in the Austro-Germanheartland. He says CDs have had a proselytising influence - 'they'resinking into the subconscious. People there are getting used to theidea that there are things they need to know about. Despite my roughGerman, the orchestras have been very responsive.'Norrington has not forgotten the UK. A former choral scholar atCambridge, he lives in Berkshire, organises the LCP's schedule with acouple of helpers and conducts 10 programmes a year with the LondonPhilharmonic. He says he is perfectly happy to work with moderninstruments. 'If you're changing the score - because many of thepublished scores are inaccurate - and you change the seating, thetempo, the phrasing, the light and shade, the Weltanschauung, italready makes a huge difference. But once they get used to the style,they may hesitantly say 'We're doing everything else, shouldn't we dropthe vibrato?'. That happened with the LPO, and the result wasabsolutely marvellous. As they begin to trust you, they realise you'renot going to turn up in a gown and mortar board. They see you're a realmusician.'Norrington's interest in historically aware performance began in theearly 1960s, when he went round the churches of Europe performingSchutz with his own amateur choir. There was no Schutz style: he had toinvent his own. From there it was but a short step to Bach, Telemannand Handel - and on to Gluck and Haydn, Beethoven and Berlioz, Schubertand Schumann. The journey has now reached Wagner and Bruckner, and theresults astonish Norrington as much as they do his admirers.In his LCP recording of the Meistersinger overture, Norrington knockstwo to three minutes off the standard performance length. 'I keepthinking that with the next thing we do, there won't be quite the samethings to discover,' he says. 'A year ago, we didn't know how Wagnerwould sound on period instruments. I thought the tempo wouldn't be abig question, it would be a matter of just hearing the same music onthese instruments. Then I started my research. In Ueber das Dirigieren,Wagner writes that when he conducted the Meistersinger overture, itlasted a few seconds over eight minutes. I thought wow] What will itsound like if we do that?'It was a revelation - less pompous and more humorous than usual, with aspring-in-the-step in the climaxes. There were similar results inBruckner's Third Symphony, which Norrington conducted at the LinzBruckner festival last autumn. He opted for the first version - the oneBruckner never heard, with none of the 'improvements' carried out byhis pupils for later performing versions. And he delved into Bruckner'sown recorded comments, which include references to a polka in thefinale.'What do most conductors do? They play it like a dirge. But if Brucknersays it's a polka, it's a polka. So I take it at a steady polka speed,which makes it sound like a dance - and the chorale suddenly becomessingable. All I'm trying to do is put the record straight, to believein the past. You don't set out to prove people wrong - you start as aninnocent, asking questions, and you stumble across these glaringlyobvious things.'Norrington says he deals with every composer's music in the same way:'I feel it, I get as much information as I can about it, and then I doit. I want to obey both sides - the heart and the head, they're inconstant creative tension. You can have the best intentions to followwhat the composer wants, but after a couple of days in rehearsal youmay find you're doing it quite differently - and that's how it shouldbe. In the end, feeling is king. It has to be your own vision.'For the past two summers he has conducted at the Rossini festival inPesaro. Was there much for him to contribute there? 'The management waskeen I should continue de-cloying Rossini - no high notes at the end,cadenzas as written, decorations with taste, tempi not too slow. Hedoesn't need to be livened up, but there's more allure in the phrasingthan he's given credit for. He's usually hijacked into 19th-centurystyle. But Zelmira was written in 1822. He went to Vienna and metBeethoven. These are fully classical works, in the sense that Beethovenis fully classical.'Norrington's journey into the past is far from finished. He visitsPrague in May to give the first historically aware performances ofSmetana's Ma Vlast. Given the chance, he would also take the LCP to theFestspielhaus at Bayreuth - 'the right orchestra in the right hall'. Hewants to play Tchaikovsky in St Petersburg, to do an 'Experience'weekend on Berg, and to conduct Lulu, Les Troyens and Meistersinger inthe opera house. He dreams of reviving the Early Opera Project, withwhich he toured Monteverdi's Orfeo in Italy in the 1980s. 'Historicalstaging is in the same state as early music was in 1960. The materialis all there. It just needs a mad entrepreneur with the right theatre.'Norrington admits that much of what he does is guess-work: it is ahazard of the road he has chosen to take. He may go wildly wrong attimes - that is the result of his risk-taking - but none of hisperformances has ever been dull or routine. Long may it stay that way.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996ARTS & LEISURE:TELEVISIONLocal heroes (7.30pm BBC2) is a little hymn to English eccentricity,both in style and content.

This is the motivation behind Battersea Arts Centre'sambitious current programme 'Telling Tales'. Alongside new Christianfables and fresh glosses on the European tales of the Brothers Grimm,it is refreshing to experience the contrasting oral tradition ofPersia: Alf Laylah Wa Laylah - Arabian Nights: The Tales ofSheherazade.The excitement starts when you enter the modest studio to find itre-formed. We sit cross-legged in-the-round, raised above the courtyardarcade beneath, peering into a shimmering arena which transforms fromking's bedroom to bustling bazaar, the banks of the Nile and the plainsbetween Cairo and Basra in the tiniest flicker of our mind's eye. 'Thishot land called Egypt' is conjured from nothing more than a fistful ofsand draining through a woman's fingers. Michael Gordon's direction andLiz Cooke's design create a compelling environment for their dedicatedcompany of ten focused performers. 'Listen,' they command: 'Listen.'It is the whim of King Shahrayar to execute his virgin brides afteronly one night, as a means of purging his kingdom of unfaithful Woman.He scapegoats them because of his own self-loathing: he murdered hisfirst queen in a fit of ill-founded jealousy. A strong-willed princess,the Sheherazade, is determined to end this needless sacrifice, andvolunteers to be his bride, but only after she has told her sister abedtime story - beautifully in Arabic - which intrigues the King. Soshe tells him more.The stories selected by the company are not of the Boys Own 'Ali Babaand the Forty Thieves' variety, but all craftily develop theproto-feminist theme. Each tale has jealous husbands wrongfullymurdering their wives for imagined infidelity, or women enduring sexand childbirth, and even broach pre-ordained marriage. Thisinterpretation of the exotic Arabic world of the Middle Ages as oneriddled with miscarriages of natural justice against women, pursues aclear agenda, but not one which is worn on the sumptuous sleeves of thewomen. The stories are elliptical, graceful and enchanting.There are stories within stories, tales chasing their own tales, richlyinterwoven like a magic carpet. The 75 minutes of storytelling does notonly reinvigorate a moribund king, but revivifies the wider audience.Suitable for older children, it could run for 1001 nights.Simon ReadeAt the BAC, London until January 7 (0171-223 2223).Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:AN ABSENCE OF INFLATION: THE FEELGOOD FACTOR IS SET TO REMAIN ELUSIVEIN 1996, SAY MARTIN WEALE AND GARRY YOUNG   By MARTIN WEALEBy most measures, 1995 was a good year for the UK economy. Inflationremained subdued, output grew by more than 2.5 per cent, unemploymentdeclined by more than 200,000 and government borrowing fell, albeit byless than was expected at the beginning of the year. In addition, MrKenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was able to take a penny off the basicrate of income tax and cut interest rates by a quarter of 1 percentagepoint.This very favourable mix of growth and inflation is rare by Britishhistorical standards and, while we think it likely to continue, thereare risks that the economy will not be as successful in 1996.The most striking aspect of the present economic situation is thevirtual absence of domestically generated inflation at a time ofrelatively fast growth and falling unemployment. This is partly areflection of the extent of disinflationary pressure in the UK labourmarket. Since the peak in unemployment in 1993, wage increases haveshown no sign of picking up and real wages have scarcely grown. Thismeans that the benefits of increased productivity have beenappropriated into profit margins. These have risen substantially:profits as a proportion of gross domestic product - at 36 per cent in1994 - are higher than in the early 1970s.One important question in present circumstances is whether thesurprising lack of growth in wage rates is evidence - as claimed by theTreasury - that the sustainable rate of unemployment has fallen. In the1980s and early 1990s it seemed that this figure was about 8 per centof the labour force. Certainly, when the unemployment rate fell to 5.5per cent by 1990, there was a sharp acceleration in inflation which wasonly squeezed out by the rise in unemployment during the lastrecession.Assuming productivity growth of 2 per cent a year, the rate of increasein wages could probably rise from its existing level of 3.25 per centto 4.5 per cent per annum and still be consistent with annual inflationof 2.5 per cent and very high profit margins. This suggests thatunemployment at 8 per cent is still above its sustainable rate.It would be premature, however, to assume from this that thesustainable rate of unemployment has indeed fallen. Unit labour costspicked up noticeably in 1995 and in manufacturing were growing inOctober at an annual rate of 4 per cent. This probably reflects thestagnation of productivity associated with the slowdown in output. Butit may be an early indication that unemployment is reaching itssustainable level.If the sustainable unemployment rate has fallen, it will be possiblefor output to grow for some time to come at more than its underlyingtrend rate without generating inflationary pressure. This does notguarantee that the chancellor's inflation target of 2.5 per cent by theend of the present parliament will be met - the weakness of domesticprices has been offset by increases in import prices arising fromsterling's depreciation of close to 7 per cent through 1995.We expect the underlying inflation rate by the end of 1996 to beslightly over 3 per cent. A better way of putting this is to say thatwe think there is only a 40 per cent chance of meeting the inflationtarget. There is also a risk that inflation will be substantiallyhigher if faster growth in import prices feeds through to domesticprices.This assessment depends on the outlook for demand, which appears tohave stalled in the second half of 1995, leading to fears that theoverall rate of growth in 1996 will be considerably slower. This timelast year the National Institute forecast growth of 2.7 per cent for1995, and this is likely to be very close to the eventual out-turn. For1996, we are predicting growth of 2.4 per cent, much lower than theTreasury's forecast of 3 per cent.Our forecast assumes that continued weakness in domestic demand will beoffset by higher export demand, helped by the fall in sterling in 1995.Individual monthly figures are erratic, but it was gratifying to seehigher exports in November as an early indication of this trend.We do not expect much of a feelgood factor to develop in 1996. This ispartly due to the very slow growth in wages.There is at present much discussion about whether the economy will belifted by a surge in consumer spending, with the suggestion thatspending is depressed by consumer gloom inspired by fears aboutemployment prospects. But the truth is that consumers are behavingperfectly normally. It looks as though they will have saved about 9 percent of their income in 1995 and we are expecting a similar figure for1996. This is lower than in any year since 1971, except during the boomperiod of 1986 to 1990 - and we doubt consumers are ready for a bingelike that of the late 1980s.In spite of the pause in growth, we expect a continuing fall inclaimant unemployment to about 1.9m, or just under 7 per cent of thelabour force. This is partly due to changes in the administration ofbenefits. While we expect some acceleration in wage growth, this willbe consistent with a downwards drift in the inflation rate as the rateof increase in import prices subsides. Profit margins will stop rising,but there will be no great pressure on them.The main risk of this forecast is that demand will be weaker thanexpected as a consequence of companies adjusting to an unintendedbuild-up of stocks, tight fiscal policy and possible weakness in demandfor British exports. In this event, inflationary pressure should weakenfurther and we would expect to see cuts in interest rates to maintainthe economy's momentum as the next general election approaches.In the longer term, we expect these favourable trends to continue. Theimproved picture in the labour market will be backed up by slightlyfaster productivity growth as the economy starts to benefit from therecent expansion of higher education and, we hope, the more stablemacroeconomic environment established since sterling left the Europeanexchange rate mechanism. We can see the growth rate accelerating to 2.8per cent and unemployment falling to 1.2m. This would not exactly be aneconomic miracle, but it would at least make a pleasant change from theyears of stop-go.Martin Weale is director of the National Institute of Economic andSocial Research, a UK research institute, and a member of theTreasury's panel of independent economic forecasters.

ROACHThe financial markets always want more of a good thing. And that seemsto be the case in looking to 1996. It is fashionable to worry that theUS economy is soft and getting softer, and that inflation is headingdramatically lower. In such an environment, the Federal Reserve isexpected to reduce short-term interest rates aggressively. Moreover,with the budget deal of a lifetime finally thought to be at hand, mostforecasters expect a dramatic further rally in the bond market.Needless to say, such a scenario hardly poses a threat to the gloriousbull market of 1995.Our prognosis for the US economy in 1996 is at odds with many of thesepresumptions. I expect neither a boom nor a bust. Real gross domesticproduct is likely to expand in a 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent range -essentially in line with what I believe to be the US economy'sunderlying long-term growth potential. The case for upside growthsurprises is relatively straightforward. It is based on solid supportfrom three important macroeconomic forces: real income generation (atpresent running above trend at 3.7 per cent); interest rates (which arenear historic lows); and the currency (which is vastly undervalued).In such a constructive environment, I expect the US economy to showsurprisingly broad-based gains in 1996. With mortgage interest ratesdown about 200 basis points over the past year, the turnround in theresidential construction sector should continue well into the new year.And there should be no let-up in US business's record-setting boom incapital spending.This is a structural phenomenon - triggered mainly by spectacularproductivity breakthroughs - that should continue to be surprisinglyimmune to the whims of the business cycle.Upside surprises in the export sector can also be expected, reflectingthe combined effects of a supercompetitive US economy and more diversetrade flows. The strong impetus for export growth in 1995 - with unitvolume growth accelerating from 4.8 per cent in the first quarter to10.6 per cent in the third - stands in sharp contrast to widespreadfears that there will be an export collapse in a sluggish globaleconomy.The good news is that the US is less dependent on its traditionaltrading partners: sales to Europe and Japan have fallen to 34 per centof overall US exports, down sharply from 42 per cent at the end of1990.Finally, reports of the demise of the American consumer are vastlyexaggerated. With consumption well supported by income generation, I donot share the widespread conviction that households are being draggeddown by excess debts. The ratio of annual debt servicing expenses toincome stands at present at 16.8 per cent, well below the highs hit inthe latter half of the 1980s. While I do not expect a consumer buyingbinge, the forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in real consumption through1996 is sufficient to account for over 1.5 percentage points of realGDP growth.The inflation prognosis is particularly intriguing. While I continue tobelieve the cost-efficient, productivity-led US recovery remainsintact, I am now of the view that the inflation rate is slowly movingup from its cyclical lows. The consumer price index rose 2.9 per centin 1995, up 0.3 percentage points from the low of 1994, and a littlemore acceleration in 1996 is expected, to an annual rate of 3.2 percent.I do not share the view that price stability is now at hand. The bulkof the disinflation of the 1990s has been a by-product of anextraordinary compression of labour costs. With productivity andcorporate profitability surging, with the unemployment rate at 5.6 percent, and with real compensation virtually stagnant for over a decade,I do not accept the notion that a submissive workforce has no choicebut to capitulate further on wages.In spite of the supposed threat of the dollar-a-day Chinese worker,this strain of productivity enhancement has now gone far enough. Thedays of asking the labour force to keep sacrificing for the noble causeof disinflation appear to be largely over. The risk of a backlash fromworkers is a growing concern - one that might have an important impacton the sociology, politics and economics of the US for years to come.As for the Fed, it is hard to accept the widespread conviction than anaggressive monetary easing is now at hand.Given the outlook for the economy and inflation, the urgency for afurther dramatic easing just is not there. Granted, the central bankmay offer a token easing in the aftermath of a budget accord. But ifmarket expectations of sharply lower short-term interest rates wererealised, the Fed would have to throw its traditional caution to thewind. If it takes its commitment to price stability seriously, and Ibelieve it does, it is difficult to imagine the Fed turning away fromthe restrictive policy bias that worked so well in the 1980s.The budget is obviously the wild card. The problem is that it is stillbusiness as usual in Washington. The best we are likely to see is aplan based on back-loaded spending cuts, front-loaded tax cuts,immunity for social security and dubious economic assumptions (forexample, that the perfect path of trend growth, low inflation anddeclining interest rates continues forever). I have come to thereluctant conclusion that the same creative mathematicians who gave usGramm-Rudman I and II and the great budget accord of 1990 are hard atwork today. Credible deficit reduction remains a dream, not acertainty.Adding it all up, it is hard to be thrilled about US Treasury bonds.Everything good is just about priced into the market. On the chancethat a budget deal is struck - even if it is a classic smoke-and-mirrors compromise - a final bull run to bond yields of 5 1/2 per centis possible.But as reality sinks in, and the economy and inflation fail to conformto market hopes, I continue to believe that the next big move in bondsis back towards an equilibrium level of 7 per cent. I expect such acorrection to take place by mid-year, at the latest.The author is chief economist and director of global economic analysisat Morgan StanleyBack to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:WAYS TO VIEW SUPPORT FOR STEELMAKING PLANTFrom Mr George Becker.Sir, In the US we have been reading with interest the reports thatBritish Steel is seeking to close an Irish steel plant on account ofsubsidies that the Irish government is to provide.In the US British Steel is seeking one of the biggest subsidies fromthe taxpayer ever recorded in order to operate a steel plant inAlabama, which British Steel is proposing to build in partnership withan American and a Japanese company.Support worth Dollars 250m is being sought from - and granted by - thestate legislature of Alabama in order to persuade British Steel and itstwo partners to open the steel plant in the state. If built, the plantwill directly threaten the jobs of at least 3,500 steelworkers in otherparts of the country.Without entering into the merits of the Irish steel plant's case, wefind it puzzling that British Steel is so hostile to subsidies inEurope and so ravenous for them in the US.Transatlantic trade and co-operation can not be built on this kind oftilted playing field.George Becker, international president, United Steelworkers of America,Five Gateway Centre, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, USBack to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:CANADIAN PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE TRAPPER'S SNAREFrom Ms Carla Bennett.Sir, Thank you for Bernard Simon's comprehensive article ('Hunting fora kinder kill', December 13).

It has exploitedthem, their culture and their way of life. Native people do notprocess, sell or store furs but are at the bottom of the fur industrychain.Because of the sympathy people feel towards the plight of the Canadiannative people, the Canadian government and the fur industry arepromoting the myth that trapping is culturally and economically centralto the native people.Fewer than 50 per cent of native homes are fully serviced with sewerageand water, native infant mortality is 60 per cent higher than theaverage among other Canadians, and 70 per cent of natives have not hada high school education.Fur trapping has not and will not relieve these problems.

Democracies have been votedout, and there is no evidence that the increasing gap between rich andpoor will not weaken many democracies.It is curious that Protestant societies were the first to nourishdemocratic institutions, and that no non-Protestant society hassustained democracy for longer than 70 years. There is nothingautomatic about progress, and nothing inexorable about the direction inwhich history will go: that will depend on the choices each of usmakes.Philippa Rann, Advance: Management Training, 58 Ridgway Road, Farnham,Surrey GU9 8NSBack to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:WHEN POLITICS REPLACES POLICYBritain's general election campaign is under way in earnest. Thedefection from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats of Miss EmmaNicholson could not have been a more potent reminder of the fragilityof Mr John Major's government. The prime minister's parliamentarymajority is now down, in effect, to three. Further deaths or defectionscould soon eliminate it entirely.Mr Major appears determined to defer the election until the lastpossible date in the spring of 1997, relying if necessary on thesupport of the Ulster Unionists to sustain him in any vote ofconfidence. Privately, opposition leaders admit that he may wellsucceed in that objective. But, amid rumours of further defections,ministers equally are obliged to acknowledge they can no longer becertain of the parliamentary arithmetic. An autumn election is now areal possibility if not yet a probability.The prime minister would be wise to pay close attention to the messageof Miss Nicholson's defection. Since his leadership victory lastsummer, Mr Major has been too anxious to appease his opponents byspeaking the language of the Eurosceptic right of the Tory party.Whatever her personal motives for joining Mr Paddy Ashdown's LiberalDemocrats, Miss Nicholson's charge that the government has beendeserting the political centre ground finds a dangerous echo amongvoters.Rhetoric calculated to appeal to the more hardline Conservativeactivists will not recover for Mr Major the support of the lesscommitted voters who will decide the outcome of the election. Mr Blairhas learned one of the golden rules of British politics - elections arenot won from the extremes of left or right but from the centre.Gruelling businessEither way, the looming campaign promises to be a gruelling andunedifying business. Politics, it seems, leaves little room these daysfor policy. The normal business of government has been suspended. MrMajor's legislative programme is designed above all to minimisecontroversy within his own party and to highlight areas of differencewith Labour. Mr Tony Blair meanwhile concentrates on inflictingtactical defeats on the government at Westminster. Those expectingLabour to unfold a detailed blueprint for government are likely to bedisappointed.As they make their promises and level their charges in the scramble forvotes, however, Messrs Major, Blair and Ashdown should pause for amoment to reflect on a more worrying feature of British political life.Politicians of all parties have rarely been held in lower publicesteem. They have themselves, mostly, to blame.Wider developmentsIt is true that wider developments have contributed to a generalweakening of faith in the ability of politicians to 'solve' nationalproblems. Global markets have delineated more clearly the limits ofeconomic independence. The necessary sharing of sovereignty in Europehas robbed Westminster of other pretensions. But to acknowledge suchtrends is not to exonerate the politicians.The important gap is not that between the limits imposed by the harshrealities of modern life and the unreasonable demands of the voters.The real disillusion stems from the gulf between promises andperformance. If politicians more readily acknowledged the constraints,the voters would be more willing to adjust their expectations. Instead,the parties wittingly exaggerate their power, promising easy solutionsto complex problems.To take the most obvious example: the central debate about the rightlevels of public spending and taxation is conducted with shamelessmendacity. One side promises painless tax cuts, the other perfectpublic services. The reality is that modest rates of economic growthwill allow neither for the constant ratcheting down of income tax ratespromised by Mr Major nor the cost-free and comprehensive welfare statepledged by Mr Blair.It is perhaps too much to expect the politicians to mend their ways soclose to an election. But this erosion of trust and confidence inparliament is inimical to good government and dangerously corrosive ofdemocracy. Ultimately, the politicians as well as the voters will bethe losers.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:ITALY AND THE EU PRESIDENCYFor the fourth time in a row, the six months' presidency of theEuropean Union has fallen to a member state whose government isseverely distracted by domestic difficulties. It seems to be becoming abad habit. First there was Germany, with a general election inmid-presidency back in 1994. Then there was France, with presidentialelections last May. The Spanish government in the past six monthsmanaged to postpone its demise in order to complete its EUchairmanship, in spite of losing its parliamentary majority.Now Italy is supposed to take the chair, not even sure if it has agovernment. Mr Lamberto Dini offered his resignation on Saturday aftercompleting his limited mandate. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro wantshim to stay on, but he is leaving it to the fractious Italianparliament to decide. It hardly makes for firm leadership and a clearagenda for Europe.Those four Euro-enthusiastic governments were supposed to co-ordinatetheir plans for the two-year period. They intended to lay thegroundwork for a clear-sighted and coherent inter-governmentalconference this year, which would mark another important step towardsthe goal of European political union. Instead, the EU is stumblingtowards that target in a familiar state of muddle.Spanish achievementsAdmittedly, Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain achieved rathermore in the past six months than one might have expected from itspolitical weakness at home. It completed preparations for the IGC,albeit with more modest ambitions than committed integrationists wouldlike. It persuaded the other 14 member states to agree a blueprint forthe launch of the single currency in 1999. It finalised a programme toreinforce the fragile relationship between the EU and US. And itorganised an impressive gathering of Mediterranean states to cementbetter co-operation between Europe, the middle east and north Africa.Not bad for a lame-duck administration.The challenge for Mr Dini, or any other head of an Italian government,is to keep that good work going. At least he does not appearover-ambitious. Italy has not tabled any heavy agenda of nationalpriorities, as other member states are sometimes tempted to do. Asuccessful launch to the IGC at the end of March is one priority;agreement on a reconstruction plan for Bosnia is another. The formershould be a formality, but the latter could be a very difficultnegotiation: the European Union must be generous if it wants the peaceinitiative in Bosnia to succeed, but every member state faces toughdomestic budget constraints, limiting the room for manoeuvre.Difficult issuesThere are always other difficult issues on the EU agenda which requireclear leadership from the presidency. In the next six months thoseinclude the plans to liberalise the EU energy market; reform of theTacis aid programme for countries of the former Soviet Union; andreform of the EU wine market. There is also strong German pressure foragreement on a stabilisation package to regulate the behaviour ofmember states after creation of economic and monetary union. These areall issues on which Italy has clear national interests, and on which aweak government in Rome may find it difficult to compromise, let alonenegotiate a deal.A strong Italian government is out of the question for the foreseeablefuture. At this moment, early elections would not solve the problem:under the present electoral laws, they are unlikely to produce a resultmuch different from the present stalemate. President Scalfaro is rightto urge the main political factions to stop bickering and agree on aprogramme of essential constitutional reforms. That could be enacted bya broad-based cross-party coalition, as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, theformer prime minister, appears to favour - though this seems somewhatunrealistic.Alternatively, Mr Dini could be asked to serve on for another sixmonths, dedicated to the EU presidency and to securing theconstitutional reforms. That would be an acceptable compromise, in theinterests of Italy and Europe.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:EUROPE UNLOCKED FOR DEALERS: ON THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING UNDER NEWRULES BREAKING DOWN EU BORDERS, JOHN GAPPER AND RICHARD LAPPER ASSESSWHO THE WINNERS AND LOSERS WILL BEThis morning NatWest Securities will commence trading on the SwedishStock Exchange from its offices in the City of London. For the firsttime, the stockbroking arm of the British bank will buy and sell sharesin Swedish companies without having to do so through local brokers. 'Wecan sit in London with a screen on our desks, and trade as if we werein Stockholm,' says Mr Scott Dobbie, chairman of NatWest Securities.The ability to trade securities across borders in this way is a productof the European Union's Investment Services Directive (ISD), whichtakes effect today. The directive aims to give Europe's thousands ofbroking firms a 'passport' to trade anywhere in the Union, and isaccompanied by the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) which imposes freshcapital requirements.Progress in implementing the two directives is likely to be slow - byDecember 31, only seven of the 15 EU states had passed the necessarylegislation. But whatever the delays, the changes are happening fasterthan previous efforts to harmonise banking supervision. 'It is far morecomplex, and it is having to be accomplished in a much shorter time,'says Ms Jane Welch, head of legal advice at the UK Securities andInvestments Board.And the impact on Europe's stock exchanges and derivatives markets willbe far-reaching. The directives are likely to favour larger investmentbanks and stock exchanges, at the expense of smaller firms andexchanges.There are two key measures in the Investment Services Directive. Thefirst is that firms will be able to operate in any EU member state,provided they are regulated in one of them. When operating outsidetheir home countries, they will be subject to rules on the conduct ofbusiness devised by the local regulators for all banks and brokers.For the larger banks already operating in more than one EU country, the'passport' rule will reduce costs and ease the regulatory burden.However, the directive is unlikely to make a significant difference totheir operations. Although there have been instances of member statesimposing strict requirements on foreign banks, most of them have beenable to operate where they want. 'We have never felt constrained aboutcrossing national borders,' says Mr Wilco Jiskoot, senior executivevice-president for merchant banking at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank.But for smaller firms operating in countries with no regulation forsecurities traders, the directive will mean being regulated for thefirst time - together with the accompanying costs, even if they areoperating purely in their domestic markets. They are also likely tolose the share of commission and fees they make in carrying out localbusiness for large investment banks. From today smaller brokers willhave to find a substitute for such earnings if they are to survive.The second key measure of the directive is to allow stock exchanges andfutures and options markets to trade throughout the EU. With increasingvolumes of equity dealing, derivatives business and bond markettransactions carried out electronically, this should in effect allowbrokers to conduct business from offices located anywhere in Europe.The effect will be to increase competition between Europe's 32securities exchanges and 24 derivatives markets. Already, for example,the Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and derivativesmarkets, plans to extend its electronic network to several othercountries. Early this year it is opening an access point in London,which will reduce the telecommunications costs for London-basedDeutsche Bo rse members to transact their business directly withFrankfurt.It is widely expected that many smaller exchanges could fold as thesepressures intensify. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, chairman of the Matif, theParis-based futures market, expects a wave of restructuring with somederivatives markets disappearing, either through merger or takeover.'It will mean some substantial modification in the landscape of futuresand options exchanges in Europe,' he says.Matif is planning to launch an ambitious joint electronic network withthe Deutsche Borse and two other French exchanges later this year whichwould allow traders to deal in French and German equities over the samescreens. It would also cover a range of futures and options products.'With the prospect of a single currency it all amounts to a new bigbang in Europe as far as the markets are concerned,' says Mr Pfauwadel.One target for European exchanges such as Paris and Frankfurt is likelyto be the London Stock Exchange's Seaq-I electronic bulletin board,which marketmakers use to advertise large blocks of European shares forpurchase and sale. Already, European bourses which have invested alarge amount on modernising their trading and settlement systems havewon back dealing business in local equities from Seaq-I.But many market participants argue that large exchanges - particularlyLondon - are likely to gain rather than lose from the directive.NatWest's strategy of trading increasingly on local exchanges ratherthan on Seaq-I does not lessen its commitment to its main base inLondon. Remote trading on overseas exchanges could help London's roleas the physical location from which traders operate by electronicmeans.Mr Giles Vardey, director of markets development at the London StockExchange, argues that remote trading is now 'commercially inevitable'.Mr Vardey accepts that competition from large exchanges will intensify,but says smaller exchanges could suffer. 'Trading power is likely tobecome concentrated in London, and the directive will hasten thisprocess,' he says.The most immediate effects of Capital Adequacy Directive are likely tobe felt by the investment banks. They will be required for the firsttime to allocate capital to cover risks of losses through adversemovements in the markets for shares, bonds or currencies. At themoment, banks have to allocate capital only to cover lending risksunder the 1988 Basle accord of international supervisors.The new rules also demand that banks and securities firms monitor theirrisks at all times keeping a permanent watch on large exposures. Forexample, trading exposures to a single customer will have to be limitedin most cases to less than 25 per cent of capital base - and can onlybe exceeded with the national regulator's permission. The larger banksare best placed to comply with such demands, having invested hugeamounts over the past few years in systems to allow them to monitortheir exposure.Smaller banks are less prepared. 'Developing the ability to spot largeexposures across the business is a significant headache for manyplayers,' says Mr Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and capitalmarkets at Price Waterhouse, the accountants. 'It imposes a level ofintegration that only the top few players have.'In theory, the Capital Adequacy Directive could lead to some bankshaving to set aside significantly more capital. But most banks believethat the directive's impact will be minimal. Mr Ian Linnell, bankinganalyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, says for mostthe impact has been 'neutral to marginal', and believes that some bankswill be able to operate with less capital than before.However, there could be extra burdens for those banks which are heavilyinvolved in equities trading, for which Capital Adequacy Directiverules are stiffer in some cases. For example, BZW, the investmentbanking arm of Barclays, will have to put aside a little more capital,according to Mr David Band, chief executive.But the biggest impact so far has arisen from the need to invest inupgrading technology to comply with the directive's requirements tomonitor group operations globally. Some of the bigger banks have spentup to Pounds 5m on systems and software, and even the smaller firmsface minimum costs of Pounds 50,000 to pay for software. Mr Band saysthere has been a shortage of technicians in London able to work on banksystems. 'That has been a big problem for the market,' he says.As the directives come into action this morning, the immediatebeneficiaries look to be the large investors who increasingly tradeacross European borders and are likely to see a reduction in charges.In the longer term, the winners will be the large investment banks,many of which are now based in London. The losers will be the smaller,less efficient brokers and the smaller exchanges that cannot find arole as the EU's stock and derivatives markets become increasinglyintegrated.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:NATWEST SEEKS TOP GUN* What will the NatWest Group do with Dollars 3.6bn that it is raisingfrom the sale of its US retail banking business to Fleet Financial? Notso long ago NatWest was the biggest of the Big Four UK banks. Now it isthe smallest. So the money should come in handy helping fulfil itsambition to transform NatWest Markets into one of the top 10 globalinvestment banks.Although NatWest appears to have ruled out bidding for a a well-knownWall Street name, like Lehman Brothers, it will have to buy something,or someone, if it wants to be a serious player in the big league. InOctober it paid a hefty Dollars 135m for Eric Gleacher's five-year-oldUS mergers and acquisition boutique. Gleacher, 55, made his namerunning Morgan Stanley's M&A department during some of the biggesthostile takeover battles in the 1980s. Now he has made his fortune byselling out to NatWest.As long as Gleacher hangs around, NatWest Markets has a chance of beingtaken seriously in the domestic US investment banking market. However,Gleacher is not an international player and NatWest Markets desperatelyneeds to beef up its global investment banking team if it wants tocompete with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley etc.Hence the owners of some European corporate finance boutiques must behoping that NatWest will be as generous to them as it was to Gleacher.After all, when Morgan Grenfell was looking for a new chief executivein 1987, it had to pay Pounds 15m for John Craven's Phoenix Securitiesto secure Craven's services.The obvious UK candidate is Hambro Magan's George Magan who worked forMorgan Grenfell before starting his own boutique in 1988. He is a goodfive years younger than Gleacher and has an equally impressive recordin the UK M&A market. But would Magan join NatWest Markets for lessthan Gleacher?Surely not. Once again NatWest may have to make do with second best.Car maintenance* What do you call a Trabant on top of a mountain pass? A miracle. Andwhat do you call a Yugo which looks like a submarine? A work of art.Motorists stuck with unloved and unwanted Yugos, products of of the nowdefunct Yugoslavian motor industry, can take heart. Kevin O'Callaghan,a lecturer at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, has bought 39abandoned Yugos for his art class. After six weeks tinkering they go ondisplay at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show.The only thing that the exhibits have in common is that they can nolonger be driven. Apart from a submarine, the students have turned thecars into such items as a giant telephone complete with push-buttonnumbers and handset; an accordion; a confessional - complete withcrosses; a grand piano which actually plays, and even a portable loo.Collect call* Who says Serbia's president is above the law? The home phone ofSlobodan Milosevic was disconnected last month because the bill wentunpaid while he was in Dayton negotiating a peace settlement for formerYugoslavia.However, justice was done in the end. According to Nasa Borba, a localnewspaper, the telephone company employee was fined 10 per cent of hermonthly wage, because she had failed to notice that the phone was on a'protected list' registered in the name of the ruling Socialist party.Honour guard* Another New Year's honour's list has come and gone and dear oldAndrew Buxton, Barclays' chairman, has still not picked up hisknighthood.There are lots of other good guys, such as the chief executives ofShell and SmithKline Beecham, who have not got their Ks. But Buxton isdifferent. He is a chairman of one of the top dozen companies in the UKand all his fellow chairman have titles. What has he done wrong?Whether Buxton deserves a knighthood after 33 years with Barclays isneither here nor there. But the latest honours list just goes to showhow little progress has been made in tidying up the present system ofhonours for business folk.Peter Wood, who created Direct Line, gets a CBE, whereas GrahamKirkham, a fellow entrepreneur, gets a knighthood. Alan Jackson, thedeparting chief executive of BTR, gets nothing. But Malcolm McIntosh, afellow Australian, gets his K for keeping down the cost of the Ministryof Defence's weapons bill.One can only hope that the leaders of big business who have not gottitles turned them down. But one suspects not.Car wars* South Africa has a problem. With one serious crime committed every 17seconds it is getting a reputation as the most dangerous country in theworld which is not at war. However, it is also starting to make a namefor itself as a testbed for new measures to combat crime.A group of insurance brokers has come up with a novel tip for motoristswhen attacked by armed hijackers at a traffic intersection. Ram the carin front. The hope is that the fuss will scare off the hijackers.Great idea. The snag is that South Africa's hijackers already use thesame tactic to tempt drivers out of their vehicles.

Othergovernments have expressed concern about accepting the 'passport'.Market officials say the seven which have to all intents and purposesmet the requirements of the directive on time are the UK, the Republicof Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.In some of these, however, the legislation itself still needs to bepassed. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and France are expected tointroduce the legislation by the middle of this year. Germany, Greeceand Spain will not be prepared for full implementation until 1997.Some countries such as France and Italy have used the enablinglegislation for the directive to push through broader financialregulatory reforms, which has held up progress.There are already strong links between the Frankfurt and Parisderivatives markets which are expected to deepen in the coming months,but the directive should extend links throughout Europe.In Germany, this will create considerable new work for the FederalSupervisory office for Securities Trading (BAWe), which was set up onlya year ago to root out insider traders and enforce compliance withstricter disclosure requirements. Analysts believe the main effect ofthe directive may be less to encourage financial institutions to openoffices in other countries than to change the location of wheretransactions are carried out - reinforcing the position of thosemarkets which already have the greatest liquidity for any particularsecurity.Mr Giuseppe Zadra, director general of the Italian banking association,said he feared the focus of trading in Italian instruments could shiftto other markets if his country's institutions did not invest andmodernise. 'National markets don't have a future, and that's why theywill have to be changed and compete on a European scale,' he said.The new rules have also raised fears there will be new risks forinvestors because institutions receiving their passport in the countrywith the weakest regulatory requirements will be able to obtainrecognition elsewhere.'I have already heard anecdotally that some dubious firms from outsideEurope are looking for the best place to get initial authorisation,'said one stock market official. 'The strength of the whole will rely onthe standards imposed by the least experienced regulator.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996UK NEWS:CHANGES SOUGHT IN TERRORISM INSURANCE FOR CITY   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance CorrespondentReform of the government-backed terrorist insurance scheme, which wasintroduced after the 1992 IRA attack on the City, is being urged amidfears that some companies may be inadequately covered.The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers is worried thatbusinesses are having to pay excessively high premium rates, which areforcing them to make a difficult choice between buying cover or riskhaving to bear the cost of a terrorist incident.Insurance industry estimates suggest that less than half of thosebusinesses which buy commercial property insurance purchase fullterrorism cover, although many have their own 'captive' insurancecompanies providing dedicated insurance cover. Others could cover thecost of an incident from other resources.However, Ms Ina Barker, executive director of the association, said:'The danger is that a lot of big businesses do not have enoughterrorism cover and are therefore putting business at risk.' Such fearscould intensify if the IRA ceasefire broke down.Airmic hopes to hold talks with the Department of Trade and Industryabout possible reform to Pool Re, the state-backed mutual reinsurancecompany. This was set up in 1993 to ensure that conventional insurancecompanies could provide terrorism cover to commercial clients.Pool Re members - which include most of the main UK-based commercialinsurance providers - have to provide terrorism insurance on fixedterms and rates. Premiums collected by insurers are pooled and used topay any claims. If Pool Re runs out of money, the government would makeup the shortfall.Since the IRA ceasefire was announced last year, premium rates havefallen. But buyers and brokers say the system remains inflexible andexpensive.Airmic is proposing a scheme in which all commercial property policieswould include a flat contribution towards the costs of Pool Re,allowing a return to the automatic provision of cover against terroristattack.

Only 4.3 per cent of the Pounds 380bnof funds measured by WM was invested in US equities.'Everybody thought the US was overpriced at the end of 1994 but itreally took off,' said Mr Peter Warrington, a director of WM, whichspecialises in performance measurement.He added that the longer-term performance of UK pension fundsdemonstrated consistently impressive results. Whether measured overfive years or 20 years, they showed the same average annual return of15.3 per cent, nearly twice the rate of inflation.'In the mid-1980s, people were saying that equities couldn't go onproducing these high returns. We had disappointing years in 1990 and1994, but over five years there is still a positive return of 16.7 percent on equities,' Mr Warrington said.Property has proved a more disappointing investment for pension funds.Although it was the best-performing sector in 1994, in 1995 propertyproduced a return of only 5.3 per cent, compared with a return for allother sectors of 20.1 per cent. Over five years, property returns haveaveraged 6.0 per cent, and property sank to 5.1 per cent of totalpension fund assets at the end of the year.WM's survey, which covers about 80 per cent of UK pension funds,reveals little change in the mix of assets held by managers, despitewidespread discussion of a tendency to 'rebalance' portfolios with morefixed-income investments and less equity.Some actuaries and investment managers have argued that pension fundsare maturing, with fewer members now actively contributing and morereceiving benefits. That should mean funds will increase bond holdingsto provide a more guaranteed stream of income.But the funds measured by WM held 77.5 per cent of their portfolios inequities last year compared to 76.6 per cent at the end of 1994.Holdings of UK and overseas bonds, other than index-linked, alsoincreased, but only to 9.9 per cent.'All the talk we have heard about funds maturing and moving into bondshasn't materialised,' said Mr Warrington.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:GOING FOR GROWTH: THE LEX COLUMNIt is perfectly reasonable to feel sanguine about the prospects for theworld's main financial markets in 1996, but it is difficult to getexcited. Inflation is low and apparently under control; growth may haveslowed, but most economies will still expand this year; and the USeconomy's soft landing looks convincing enough.But after last year's bull run, there is much less to go for. In 1995,inflation fears proved overdone, allowing interest rates to be cut. Theresulting bond market rally, coupled with bid activity, fuelledadvances in stock prices.Even though there are more interest rate cuts to come, the pace isslowing and much of the benefit is already priced into both bonds andstocks. Furthermore, the US market, which led the way last year, looksrather overvalued. The stock market, having risen more than 30 per centlast year, faces a proliferation of earnings downgrades. Since earningsare not likely to fall off a cliff, a slowdown in economic growth doesnot necessarily mean stock prices will stall. But the market looksexpensive relative to trend earnings and bond yields. Dividend yieldsare low, even when share buy-back programmes are taken into account.The benign economic environment probably rules out a 1987- style crash,but a correction is not only likely, it would probably be beneficial.And there are several potential triggers: the US budget agreement, forexample, has still to be thrashed out.EuropeA correction in the US would hit the UK hardest, since it has benefitedmost from the bull run. Although strong earnings growth is likely tocontinue into 1997, the UK has other problems, including the growingpossibility of an early election, as the Conservative party's majoritydwindles. In fact, Prime Minister John Major is likely to hold on topower until 1997 even without a majority, but any weakening of hiscontrol over the election's timing will be viewed as a negative by thestock market.The UK also has more to fear from inflation than most other markets,given its relatively rapid economic growth and an expected rise inconsumer spending. This will benefit some sectors, such ashousebuilding and retailing, but the danger is that any further ratecuts in the first half of the year will have to be reversed in thesecond - or worse that the government may try to ignore overheating ofthe economy, since raising rates in the run-up to the election wouldhardly be politically expedient. With gilts currently yielding twice asmuch as equities, the balance looks about right. But inflation jitterscould cap gilt prices, halting further equity advances.Further bid activity, as in the US, will help underpin stock marketprices, but estimates that the FT-SE 100 index, whatever early gains itmakes, will end the year around 3,750, less than 100 points above itscurrent level, are probably sensible.In continental Europe, the problem is too little growth. This bodeswell for bonds. Even without further short-term rate cuts in Germany,there is room for bond yields to fall. More generally, any signs thatthe structural problems of high social spending and unwieldy budgetdeficits are being addressed should encourage investors. Bunds andother European bond markets may well outperform the US market in 1996 -the problem is the strongest outperformance is often on the way down,so it may be safer to bet on yield differentials than on absolute pricemovements.JapanTokyo's Nikkei-225 has ended the year roughly where it started, justbelow 20,000, inviting the question of whether US and European fundmanagers are right to increase their weighting in Japan. Few marketshave performed as well over the past six months. The index has gained37 per cent since its July low, though the yen's decline over thatperiod has eroded more than half that gain when measured in dollars.Currency risk will continue to bedevil foreign investors as economicrecovery sucks in more imports, further driving down the trade surplus.But the attraction of Japan in 1996 is that it is the only leadingmarket set to benefit both from the early stage of an economic revivaland a pick-up in corporate earnings. A rise in sales should kick in, ontop of the margin improvements achieved over the past year.On the surface, much of this recovery has already been discounted, withthe index standing at around 83 times prospective earnings - high evenby Japan's historical standards. However, a more useful guide to theNikkei's value is the ratio between equity and bond yields. Currently,Japanese government bonds yield 1.5 times as much as equities, wellbelow the long-term average. As a result, Japanese institutions, heavynet sellers of equities last year, may well favour equities over bondsin 1996. The top Japanese life insurers and brokers have shed recentpessimism and forecast a 1996 high for the Nikkei in the mid-20,000s.They may be right.Emerging marketsEmerging markets look cheap. On most valuation measures, a rebound isalready overdue. Last year's lacklustre performance partly reflects thecrisis of confidence following the collapse of the Mexican market atthe start of the year. In fact, international investors had littlereason to take the higher risks associated with emerging markets. USfund managers in particular were able to make impressive returns intheir own domestic market.But there are signs that US money is starting to move offshore again.As fund managers are forced to look for growth outside the domesticmarket, emerging markets are bound to get at least some of that money.Typically, US managers have looked south of the border. But there arestill good reasons for avoiding Latin America, not only because of thedire economic problems which continue to afflict some countries. Themain bond market is the dollar-denominated Brady bond market, whichwould suffer from a US market correction. Slow growth, particularly byemerging markets standards, makes stock markets relativelyunattractive, given the associated currency risk.Asian stock markets look a better bet. Not only does Asia enjoy strongeconomic growth and a cash surplus; the markets are likely to benefitfrom funds from Japan, as well as the US and UK.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:CHRISTMAS BRINGS CHEER TO TRADING STATEMENTS: UK RETAILERS   By NEIL BUCKLEYExpect to hear news of another strong Christmas as large retailers maketheir January trading statements, writes Neil Buckley. Christmasaccounts for a large part of many retailers' annual profits. Reports ofa buoyant December and good start to the post-Christmas sales havebreathed life back into a sector depressed by gloomy results in theautumn.Three retailers thought to have had the liveliest festive seasons -Argos, Dixons and Next - report next week. Argos should unveil a totalsales increase in double digits for the third Christmas running, whileNext is expected to have at least maintained the 10 per cent increasereported in September. Dixons is forecast to report a 10 per centincrease in like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, overChristmas.Also reporting the same week are Boots and Sears. In the former, strongperformances from Boots the Chemists and Halfords will be tarnishedslightly by sales declines in Do It All, and the Fads/Homestyle homedecorating business. For Sears, total sales are expected to be slightlyup, but like-for-like sales down.The following week, Body Shop, Storehouse and Marks and Spencer areforecast to report sales increases of at least 5 per cent. At House ofFraser a like-for-like increase of perhaps 3 per cent is expected.One year after the poor trading statement that sparked the departure offour directors, Kingfisher is expected to reveal recoveries inWoolworths and Comet, but falling sales in Darty, the French electricalchain.WH Smith is forecast to report a Christmas sales increase of up to 7per cent in its interim results on January 24, while Burton, at itsannual meeting the following day, is expected to announce a continuingimprovement in sales and gross margins.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:GREENBURY GUIDELINES WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST: OTHER COMPANIES   By WILLIAM LEWISThe Greenbury committee's report on executive pay will move into thespotlight in January and February, with the publication of aconsultation document and several companies' annual meetings held underGreenbury rules for the first time, writes William Lewis.Next Monday, a consultation document on possible methods for disclosingthe true value of directors' pensions will be launched. The Faculty ofActuaries and the Institute of Actuaries, together with the StockExchange and the Department of Trade and Industry, are to send thepaper to public companies and are seeking their views by February 9.The Greenbury committee's report, published in July, recommended thatpension costs be disclosed to shareholders to reflect the value to theindividual as well as the true cost to the company.The Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries put forward apreferred method but there were calls for wider consultation.Many companies feared that directors' remuneration could appear toincrease by startling amounts under the new code. The consultationdocument will include a number of options - including allowing for the'smoothing' out of the effects of Greenbury.Other Greenbury recommendations have already been put in place by somecompanies and are due to be tested at annual meetings in the next fewweeks.Bass and Burton, in their annual reports sent to shareholders lastmonth, were the first companies to give a separate remunerationcommittee report on executive pay. Both companies' remunerationcommittee chairmen will be answering shareholder questions on pay atthe meetings on February 8 and January 25 respectively.Greenbury also recommended that companies seek shareholder approval fornew long-term incentive schemes.

Last week, the group agreed to sell its Little Chef and HappyEater roadside restaurants, Welcome Break motorway service areas andTravelodge budget hotels to the UK brewing and leisure group. The dealis conditional on the failure of Granada's bid.The document is expected to include a promise to increase annualdividends, which were cut from 9.91p to 7.5p for the year to January 311993 and were last raised five years ago.The document will show that Christie & Co, the property surveyor, hasrevalued the hotels upwards by Pounds 355m to Pounds 3.35bn, just over10 per cent above the last estimate in January 1994 and representingnet asset value per share of 325p. This excludes the stake in the SavoyGroup, which Forte plans to sell.The revaluation was dismissed by Granada, which said if the increasehad been added to assets on July 31 last year, the return on assetswould have fallen from 7.4 to 6.5 per cent. 'Frankly, this looks like abit of an own goal by Forte,' said Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chiefexecutive.Forte paid Pounds 280m to acquire the Meridien chain of 58 hotels fromAir France just over a year ago in order to give it a biggerinternational presence. Of the 26 new projects under consideration, oneis in Manchester and all the others abroad, including Beirut andBangkok.Most will be management contracts, although equity stakes have not beenruled out. Expansion in the US remains a priority.Sir Rocco Forte, chairman, said the main thrust for Meridien would beoverseas. The first year had been spent in integrating the business,and Pounds 14m had been taken from head office costs.'We have only just started,' he said. 'Now we will be much morepro-active.'Today's document will concentrate almost entirely on the hotels, givingdetails of performance. Meridien is expected to have contributed 20 percent to group operating profits.Operating profits from Forte's Exclusive hotels - including the GeorgesV in Paris and the Grosvenor House in London - are expected to accountfor 10 per cent of hotel profits, with other London hotels accountingfor 25 per cent. The Posthouse (including Crest) and Heritagetraditional hotels are likely to show contributions of 25 per cent and20 per cent respectively.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:NEW LOOK RETAILER SOLD TO INSTITUTIONS FOR POUNDS 170M   By TIM BURTNew Look, the privately-owned fashion retailer founded by entrepreneurMr Tom Singh was yesterday sold to a venture capital buy-out group forabout Pounds 170m.Mr Singh, who started the company in 1969 with a Pounds 5,000 loan, hasagreed to sell the 323-store chain to institutional purchasers led byBZW Private Equity and jointly underwritten by Prudential VentureManagers.The sale follows New Look's abortive attempt to come to the market inOctober 1994, which it abandoned the day before its scheduled flotationamid fears it would not raise the estimated Pounds 150m it was seeking.Under the terms of yesterday's deal, New Look's shareholders -dominated by Mr Singh and his family trusts - will initially receiveabout Pounds 105m in cash and shares worth about Pounds 50m in Vallsar,an investment vehicle set up for the transaction.That will leave the Singhs with 25 per cent of Vallsar, which is to berenamed New Look. BZW Private Equity has also offered a further Pounds15m payment contingent on New Look's performance in the three years toMarch 1998.Mr Gavin Aldred, New Look's director in charge of corporate strategy,said proceeds from the disposal would fund expansion: 'In the 12 monthsto March this year, we will have opened 76 stores in the UK and 10 inFrance, and we aim to continue growing at about 50 outlets a year.' Heclaimed New Look - advised by J. Henry Schroder - was Britain's mostprofitable specialist women's wear retailer.

The other party 'lends' the money and 'borrows' the bond,in much the same way as a pawnbroker would take temporary possession ofvaluables in return for a personal loan. But although the repo lookslike a loan, in reality it encompasses a disposal and a subsequentacquisition, reducing credit risk in the event of default by eitherparty.And in the international bond markets, repos play a more complexeconomic function. Dealers frequently borrow money through repos tofund the purchases of the same bonds, which are then committed ascollateral. Securities firms usually rely on this means to financetheir operations as they do not have access to the interbank marketswhere banks lend to each other.At the same time, dealers 'lend' money through repo agreements, in asimilar way to how they might place money on deposit with a bank,although in this case they have the additional security of holding abond as collateral. At the same time, the 'borrowed' bonds can be usedto meet short-term trading needs. In the bond markets, dealersfrequently take short positions (sell bonds they do not own), when theyfeel prices are likely to fall.In the UK, the ability to carry out repos or to borrow or lendgovernment stock through stock lending agreements has been restrictedby law to stock exchange money brokers - effectively middlemen. Inaddition, only gilt-edged market-makers, a group of more than 20securities firms licensed by the Bank of England, have been allowed to'short' the market.The new, more liberal rules will make it possible for a much widerrange of traders and investors to operate in the UK gilts market. 'Thefact that it is now seen as a clear and open market will make itattractive. It will encourage people into the marketplace. They nolonger see it as an esoteric market with rules of its own,' says MrDavid Brayshaw, managing director LM Money Brokers.Ms van Dorssen at NatWest Markets says that with a deep and liquidunderlying market and a robust futures market in place, repo'sdevelopment will increase the range of strategies open to traders.The impact of repo on the UK's money markets should also besignificant. 'It will be beneficial for the money market and shouldhelp to restore liquidity,' says Mr Brayshaw. 'There has been a lack ofshort-dated government paper that can be traded. Also, the overnightmarket, which determines funding costs, has come to be dominated by asmall group of players.'Ms Van Dorssen says cash managers will be able to place larger amountsof money on 'a repo line' than on an 'unsecured deposit line'.And in the short-term, at least until liquidity in the market picks up,dealers expect repo rates to be close to the London interbank rates,offering investors the double advantage of security and extra yield.Nevertheless, traditional market participants may take time to adapt tothe new environment.Some UK institutions, which currently earn a fee by lending stock ontheir books to money brokers, may have to modify their systems andlearn new skills. Specialists in managing medium and long-terminvestments, they may be less prepared for the demands of short-termmoney market management necessary in the repo market. And dealers mayprefer to obtain finance through existing relationships with moneybrokers.In the long-term, however, dealing directly with other dealers andinvestors through repos should become cheaper and more attractive. MrSimon Briscoe, chief UK economist at Nikko Europe, says money marketoperators will respond to repo similarly to way in which Britishmotorists responded to the opening of the motorways in the early 1960s.'It wasn't an immediate transition. Even though motorways allowed formore traffic and bigger lorries people still use the A roads.'

Mr Michael Eisner, group chairman, wanted to sign her inthe hope that a high-profile star would raise Disney's stature in themusic market and attract other acts.Under the terms of Disney's agreement with PolyGram, Ms Jackson wouldhave split her recording contract between the two groups. She wouldhave signed to Disney in North America and to A&M, the PolyGramsubsidiary which was her original record label, for the rest of theworld.It now looks as though Janet Jackson will sign a new contract withVirgin Music, the record label to which she has been contracted since1991 when her A&M deal ended. Virgin, owned by Thorn EMI, the UKleisure group, is thought to have out-bid Disney and PolyGram justbefore Christmas, although it has not yet signed a contract with MsJackson.Mr Eisner is still keen for Disney to expand in the music market, whichis one of the fastest growing and most profitable areas of theentertainment industry. Until now the focus of the group's musicinterests has been its Hollywood Records subsidiary founded six yearsago.Hollywood's performance has been erratic. It has released a number ofhighly successful soundtrack albums under the Walt Disney record label.The Lion King, the soundtrack to the 1994 animated hit, has sold morethan 9m copies in the US. But it has failed to become a force in themarketplace.One option for Disney would be to continue to try to attracthigh-profile stars. This could be slow and expensive as there is fiercecompetition among rival labels for best-selling acts. An alternativewould be to bid for EMI Music, the Thorn EMI division that owns Virgin,which is expected to be demerged from the rest of the Thorn EMI groupnext autumn. But Disney could face fierce competition from other NorthAmerican companies.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:DANA PETROLEUM PLANS LISTING AND SEEKS POUNDS 16MDana Petroleum, the independent oil production company, plans to seek aLondon listing and raise approximately Pounds 16m from a placing, openoffer and intermediaries offer.

The completionof the offer will mean Mediobanca will hold 15.26 per cent of Ferfin,with an estimated disbursement of L582bn (Dollars 367m).Mediobanca finally accepted the ruling of Consob, the stock exchangewatch dog, late last Friday. It had initially lodged an appeal with theregional administrative court of Lazio, and when that failed with thehigher court of the state council.Pricing of the offer presents several problems. Principal among thesehas been the L953bn Ferfin rights issue in mid-December. This came wellafter Consob's first ruling that Mediobanca must make a public offer.Before the rights issue, analysts suggested L1,580 per sharerepresented the average price paid by Mediobanca in its October raid onFerfin.But just before the rights issue they were suspended at L1,056; andConsob announced only shareholders on the register before the issuecould be the subject of Mediobanca's public buy offer. This point isapparently being questioned by Mediobanca's lawyers.Analysts also pointed out that by being obliged to acquire 15 per centof Ferfin, the outlay represented over 10 per cent of Mediobanca'sassets, a large exposure.Robert Graham in RomeHealth groups abandon mergerAfter a busy year of consolidation, the US healthcare industry ended1995 on a sour note with the formal dissolution of a Dollars 1.6bnmerger that would have created the country's largest managed careorganisation.WellPoint and Health Systems International, two Californian healthcaregroups, abandoned a merger agreement reached last April.

The twohad listed the ability to grow beyond their Californian base as a keyreason for the combination.Under the terms of the all-stock deal, shareholders in Health Systemswould have received 45 per cent of the shares in the combined group.However, the two sides are believed to have been unable to agree onwhat role the smaller company's managers should play after a merger.The deal would have provided the springboard for a far more widely-heldpublic company than either is at present.Richard Waters in New YorkMaculan, the troubled Austrian construction group, said creditor bankshad agreed an extensive financing package to salvage the company in itsentirety.The financing measures include cash-credit lines worth Sch910m (Dollars90m) which will be divided between the group's Austrian and Germancreditor banks according to the previous volume of credit granted.

The unittrust operation will sell two unit trusts - a UK growth fund and abalanced fund which includes an element of overseas exposure.Apart from the policies it designs itself, Nationwide Life will alsosell a permanent health insurance policy bought in from PPP, thehealthcare company.This is a smaller and simpler range than the Guardian policies whichNationwide has been offering, but Mr Boardman said the straightforwardnature of the products should help to keep costs down. He believed therange was still broad enough to meet most customers' needs.For Nationwide, as for other mortgage lenders which have set up theirown financial services businesses, a key element will be to marketthese products to the entire customer base - savers as well asborrowers.Initially, Nationwide's salaried financial services sales force will bemade up of about 340 agents and will grow to 380 by the end ofFebruary. Just over half of these will be branch-based, with theremainder available to visit customers.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:FRENCH BANK SEEKS SHORT-TERM FINANCE   By ANDREW JACK in Paris   PARISCredit Foncier de France, the specialist French property bank, isconsidering obtaining a substantial short-term bridging loan while itundertakes a wide-ranging restructuring plan.Bank executives are believed to be discussing the idea of seeking aloan from a commercial bank, secured on its assets, which would lastabout three years.Separately, they are holding talks with the government about short-termways to stave off the growing financial crisis triggered by thewithdrawal of its monopoly rights over certain state-backed housingloan schemes.The idea is to provide the bank with time to introduce a restructuringprogramme which could reduce costs by 30 to 40 per cent in as little asthe next two years, including job cuts and the possible sale of some ofits central Paris offices.However, executives want to reduce staffing without any redundancies sothey are likely to extend the length of their programme to at leastthree years.They are also discussing refocusing the bank, possibly by withdrawingfrom activities such as loans to property developers and localauthorities, and concentrating on core activities of loans to low andmiddle-income housing projects.Credit Foncier's ability to raise funds on the capital markets has beentightly restricted recently because its share price has dropped sharplyand its credit rating has fallen.It was dealt a severe blow during December when the French stock marketregulators recommended against it proceeding with a proposed mergerwith its 55 per cent-owned subsidiary, Societe des Immeubles de France.The deal would have provided a much-needed FFr1bn (Dollars 204m) boostto its balance sheet. It is now looking at other ways of achieving arecapitalisation.The bank is also likely to discuss with the French government, in themedium-term, a change to its legal statutes to make it more like itsprivate sector competitors.Although it is a quoted company without any state shareholding, thegovernment appoints its chairman or 'governor'.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:HYUNDAI TO ACCELERATE DECENTRALISATION: SOUTH KOREA'S BIGGESTFAMILY-RUN 'CHAEBOL' IS MOVING WITH THE TIMES, SAYS JOHN BURTONMr Chung Mong-koo, Hyundai's new chairman, is likely to preside overthe gradual break-up of the giant family-owned South Korean industrialgroup his father established in 1947.That, however, is the way Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, wantsit. In an attempt to avoid a family fight over the Hyundai empire afterhis death, Mr Chung decided several years ago to divide it amongseveral of his sons and nephews by transferring his stock in most ofHyundai's 45 companies to them.The result has been the creation of smaller and decentralised groupswithin Hyundai that amount to a confederation of allied companies.The process is expected to accelerate with the recent formal transferof management control from the elder Mr Chung and his brother ChungSe-yung, who succeeded him as chairman in 1987, to their sons.Hyundai's restructuring, which is expected to benefit the group, couldserve as an example to Korea's other conglomerates, or chaebol. Thechaebol have been widely criticised for being too big and inefficientwhile fierce competition, for example, has led to duplication ofactivity.Government officials have long urged them to abandon many of theirmarginal businesses and concentrate on a few specialised industrialsectors to improve their global competitiveness.Splitting Hyundai into smaller groups is expected to help achieve thesegoals. Each mini-Hyundai group focuses on only a few industries, andthese units are less able to support unprofitable activities than theywere within the old monolithic structure.Under a reorganisation plan announced a year ago, Hyundai was dividedinto six main groups, with almost all now controlled by one of MrChung's sons and nephews.The most ambitious of the new sub-groups is the one controlled by MrChung Mong-koo, the new Hyundai chairman and eldest surviving son ofthe Hyundai founder.In 1977, he established Hyundai Precision & Industry as a cargocontainer company, which became the world's largest. Hyundai Precisionnow produces railway engines and carriages, sports and utilityvehicles, and military equipment. It also plans to enter the aerospacesector, assembling aircraft and satellites.Mong-koo also controls Hyundai's small steel operations, which he wantsto expand by building a large mill that would supply steel to Hyundai'scar and shipbuilding operations.Mr Chung Mong-hun, his brother and the new Hyundai vice-chairman, hasdeveloped Hyundai Electronics into one of the world's biggest producersof computer memory chips in less than a decade. Another brother, MrChung Mong-jun, controls Hyundai's shipbuilding operations, the biggestin Korea.Hyundai Motors, Korea's largest car company and considered the group'scrown jewel, is being taken over by the family of Mr Chung Se-yung, thebrother of the Hyundai founder. His only son, Mong-kyu, has beenappointed as the car company's new chairman at the age of 33.Mr Chung Mong-hyuk, another nephew of the Hyundai founder, has beennamed new president of Hyundai's petrochemical and oil refiningcompanies, another growth area.Other main Hyundai companies, including its trading house andconstruction company, remain under the control of the group founder.A formal break-up of Hyundai is likely to take some time since thegroup is held together by a complex web of cross-holdings. These ties,however, should weaken as the government imposes limits oncross-holding arrangements in attempt to reduce the economic dominanceof the chaebol.Family solidarity is also expected to prevent an early break-up ofHyundai. The Hyundai companies are likely to operate on the same basisthat Mr Chung Ju-yung has established with several of his brothers, whohave created their own small industrial groups that partly depend onHyundai for business.Hyundai Motors, for example, is the biggest customer for the motorvehicle parts company of the Halla group, founded by Mr Chung In-yung.Nonetheless, internal conflict may also increase as rivalry growsbetween the Hyundai companies. Hyundai Precision, for example, ischallenging Hyundai Motors by producing four-wheel drive vehicles andmini-vans.A looser organisational structure may also make it more difficult topush through large projects that were once easily tackled under theautocratic management style of the Hyundai founder.Analysts will also be watching closely to see whether the new Hyundaichairman can gain group support for his projected Dollars 10bn steelmill, which has been criticised by some Hyundai subsidiaries asunnecessary.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:NETSCAPE LEADS THE FASHION FOR US NEW ISSUES: FT WRITERS LOOK AT THEBEST PERFORMING SHARES AROUND THE WORLD IN 1995New issues - if you could lay your hands on them - were the hottestperforming stocks in the US last year, with Netscape Communications,the Internet company, racing to the fore, writes our New York staff.The market for initial public offerings was more active than it hadever been, but the few sceptics that remained claimed this was a sureindication the US market was way out in front of most traditionalvaluations measures.Netscape, which produces a browser for the Internet, was floated inAugust at Dollars 28 a share, and by year-end it was trading at Dollars139, having reached a peak in early December of Dollars 174.Other strongly performing new issues included Pixar, which handled theanimation for Disney's latest hit film Toy Story. It floated at Dollars22 just after the film's opening at Thanksgiving, and quickly reached ahigh of Dollars 49 1/2, although by year-end it had fallen back toaround Dollars 28 7/8.Many of the new issues were in the technology sector, which had led themarket higher for much of the year, although towards the end of theyear many of these stocks faltered as growth in semiconductor salesslowed.The technology sector's performance should not obscure notable gains inother sectors. Lower interest rates and hopes for productivity gainsmade bank and insurance company shares among the best performers.Banks, deep into a round of mergers, recorded gains of more than 50 percent.Steel companies, most of which crawled back into profit only in 1994,managed the dubious distinction of forming the worst-performing stockmarket sector.Another poor performer was the retail sector, which ended anotherdifficult year with a disappointing Christmas.Construction fallsBuilding sites abound in German cities and cranes cover the Frankfurtskyline, but construction shares headed remorselessly downwards in1995, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. The sector's share performanceslumped by 33 per cent and 1996 is not expected to show much, if any,improvement.By contrast, the electrical and electronics sector had a strong year,adding 34 per cent. Apart from Siemens, reaping the benefits of itsaggressively profit-oriented restructuring, the sector contains SAP,the fast-growing producer of business software. SAP's share performancehas been meteoric in the past two years, though it has slowed recently.Commerzbank, whose own new headquarters is taking shape in Frankfurt,estimates that profits of quoted construction companies will rise amere 2 per cent in 1996 after 6 per cent in 1995. The German commercialand homes building boom is now over, with public sector constructionalso held back by budget constraints.Mr Ingo Mainert, a Commerzbank analyst, says stocks likely to performin line with or better than the overall market this year includemotors, steel, electricals and electronics, and insurance.The bank foresees the DAX index rising to 2,500 or even 2,600 pointsafter it closed on Friday at 2,254, a rise of 7 per cent on the year. Ayear ago, the bank had hoped for 2,400 but the weak dollar and higherthan expected pay rises threw out its calculations.For electrical and electronics companies, Commerzbank expects anoverall profits rise of 21 per cent this year after 22 per cent in1995. Earnings in the steel, engineering, motor and metal industriesshould show steeper rises, it says. Further markets will be coveredover the following days.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:THOMAS LOCKER'S BID FOR PENTRE ATTACKED   By TIM BURTThe largest shareholder in Thomas Locker yesterday claimed theengineering group was seeking a reverse takeover with its proposedPounds 7.5m bid for Pentre, the industrial drums manufacturer.Mr John Carr, who holds 22.6 per cent of Thomas Locker's ordinaryshares, said the purchase price overvalued Pentre: 'The shareholders ofThomas Locker not only get no premium for the very significant valueinherent in the company they own, they are being asked to approve ascheme that will lose them control.'Mr Carr, who acquired his stake in the company last May, urgedshareholders to reject the acquisition, which is being funded by theissue of 8.62m new and 25.9m A ordinary shares.

As the stockshave risen these premiums - known as 'backwardations' - have narrowed.'If stocks keep rising, and we do expect they will, then the spreadsshould come in even more,' Adam Rowley of Macquarie Equities toldReuters.'At some stage in the first quarter of 1996 we are looking for quite asharp fall in copper prices,' he added.'With February/March at Dollars 80 to Dollars 90 backwardation it looksas if this period will stay tight,' said Wolfgang Becker of IceniCommodities Brokerage.

It revives anissue which some might have thought buried: the power of themultinationals. It is also a useful reminder that the triumph of freetrade - an idea implicit in most investment strategies today - cannotbe taken for granted.The opening salvo came in a review by the political theorist Mr FrancisFukuyama of a book called Opposing The System. The book, by a veteranleftist Mr Charles Reich, reportedly argues that the current socialmalaise - poverty, unemployment and so forth - has been engineered bylarge corporations for their own benefit. Therefore, it says, thepowers of government should be increased to control them.Mr Fukuyama regarded this as 1960s claptrap. The remedies proposed byMr Reich, he argued, had got us into this mess in the first place.Poverty and crime were caused not by big companies, but by biggovernment.Enter stage left another 1960s veteran, the consumers' champion MrRalph Nader. Big corporations, he wrote in reply, erode democracy,export jobs, and weaken the legal safeguards for workers, consumers andthe environment. 'Until Mr Fukuyama understands that a society rotsfrom the head down and that corporate power needs analysis, he willnever understand Mr Reich's thesis,' he concluded.So far, so familiar. But the role of the multinationals is becomingpart of a wider issue: that of free trade. If you believe that freetrade is destroying jobs and damaging society, you are bound to blamethe multinationals as its agents.As another book recently put it, global free trade 'will impoverish anddestabilise the industrialised world, while at the same time cruellyravaging the third world.' The author is no 1960s leftist, but theerstwhile corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith.As a blend of right-wing populist and born-again environmentalist, SirJames forms an unlikely bridge between the two wings of protectionism.On the right, he is joined by the US presidential candidate Mr PatBuchanan and by the fellow-billionaire Mr Ross Perot.On the left, he links with those who argue that free trade enables badenvironmental practice to drive out good: that through the agency -again - of the multinationals, production will gravitate to countriesfree from costly environmental controls.Those who feel paranoid about the unholy alliance of free-tradegovernments and big business can point to one central fact. As thechart reminds us, world trade has indeed been growing rapidly inrelation to the world economy since the late 1980s, having previouslygrown in line.But are corporations growing in proportion? The evidence is mixed. Lastyear, the three biggest US companies by revenues, as listed by Fortunemagazine, were General Motors, Ford and Exxon. Their combined sales ofDollars 384bn (Pounds 249.3bn) were equal to 5.7 per cent of US GDP.The figure for the same trio 20 years before was 6.7 per cent.But if US multinationals are not bigger, they may still be morepowerful. Arguably, modern communications and the lowering of tradebarriers give them much more opportunity to arbitrage labour andcapital around the world. Hence the solution of such as Mr Buchanan:put the barriers up again.It might be thought that the impulse to free trade is politicallyunstoppable: and indeed, that in the coming world of the Internet thegenie cannot be put back in the bottle anyway.Not everyone in the investment community agrees. The highly successfulinvestor Mr George Soros, for instance, argues that electronic trade isnot intrinsically different from the old kind, just faster. It would beperfectly feasible to re-impose exchange controls, he says. Singlecountries could not do it, but groups of countries could.Mr Soros is gloomily convinced that the present world order, which heregards as a golden age of capitalism, will ultimately break down. Thelast comparable period, he says, was the end of the 19th century. Inthose days, 'the British Empire was at the heart of the system, and hadan interest in maintaining security. When there was trouble, it sent agunboat. Now there is no chief beneficiary (from stability): certainlynot the US.'Should the average investor worry about all this? Not for the timebeing, perhaps. Both of the likely protagonists in next year's USpresidential elections, Mr Clinton and Mr Robert Dole, are professedfree traders: although both will bear watching for signs of concessionsto their respective outer wings.The point is rather that the case for a prolonged global bull marketcontains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, we are told thatmultinational corporations are enjoying a one-off shift to greaterproductivity and cheaper labour, based largely on the globalisation ofmarkets. On the other, we are told the globalising process does notentail empoverishing one set of workers to the benefit of another. Freetrade means faster growth, so the pie gets bigger.This worked very well for small countries like Taiwan and Korea, whichwere able to develop and open up at their own pace. It is anothermatter, to paraphrase Sir James Goldsmith, when political upheaval,modern communications and the liberalisation of capital movements hurl4bn workers into the world economy in the space of a few years.Hence the internal contradiction. Proponents of the bull market arguethat the shift in power between capital and labour is profound enoughto last for a generation. The question is what that generation willmake of it. If it feels disposed to rebel, global free trade could bethe first casualty.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FEATURES & OPTIONS:TIME TO REWRITE INFLATION TARGET: ECONOMICS NOTEBOOK / ROBERT CHOTEOver the last five years many countries have adopted formal targets forinflation as the centrepiece of their economic policies. But turning avaguely expressed enthusiasm for low inflation into a precise numericalobjective is not as straightforward as it sounds.For one thing, policymakers face a trade-off between the need toestablish credibility and to demonstrate humility. Any target has to bedemanding enough to persuade people that the authorities are seriousabout achieving low inflation; but it cannot be too demanding becausecredibility will then be lost again when the target proves impossibleto hit.In 1992 Britain adopted a formal inflation target comprising threeobjectives: underlying inflation between 1 and 4 per cent until spring1997; between 1 and 2.5 per cent in spring 1997; and below 2 per centin the long term. The most demanding element soon slipped from publicconsciousness, but the first two stayed in place. By last summer,however, the remaining target had to be updated. Interest rate changestake about two years to affect prices, so it was becoming too late todo much about inflation within the target period.Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced therefore in his MansionHouse speech that he would aim for underlying inflation of 2.5 per centor less beyond spring 1997. He predicted this would keep inflationbetween 1 and 4 per cent most of the time, recognising that unexpectedevents might push inflation higher when it was too late forpolicymakers to react.This formulation has caused confusion ever since and influential voiceshave argued that it needs rewriting again. Sir Terry Burns, thepermanent secretary to the Treasury, said shortly before Christmas thatthe government should move away from targeting a range for inflation,concentrating instead on a single figure. Some senior officials at theBank of England agree.The Mansion House speech left many questions unanswered in the minds ofCity and academic economists. Was the new target looser or tighter thanits predecessor? Was the inflation objective 1 to 2.5 per cent, 1 to 4per cent or 2.5 per cent and below?The conduct of interest rate policy in subsequent months only deepenedthe mystery. Mr Eddie George had told the chancellor in May thatinflation was set to exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time and that heshould therefore raise rates. The chancellor refused because he thoughtinflation would be lower. Economists were unnerved by the disagreement,but at least both sides appeared to agree on the definition of thetarget - 2.5 per cent or below.But in September the Bank muddied the waters. It continued to predictthat inflation would exceed 2.5 per cent in two years' time, butdropped its demand for a rate rise. Shortly afterwards, Mr Mervyn King,its chief economist, argued that the target would be satisfied ifinflation averaged 2.5 per cent or less over a long period. Toobservers who had thought the authorities were supposed to be erring onthe side of caution - keeping inflation below 2.5 per cent except inunavoidable circumstances - this looked like a loosening of policy.But in a sense it was simply a recognition of the inevitablelimitations of inflation targeting. These limitations were demonstratedby Andrew Haldane and Christopher Salmon, from the Bank, in a studypublished last month*. They constructed a model of British inflationsince 1960 and reran history as though the authorities had pursued a2.5 per cent inflation target by setting interest rates on the basis ofa forward-looking forecast.The study suggested inflation would have been lower and less variablehad the authorities followed this policy, as the graphic illustrates.But Haldane and Salmon also used the model to assess the possibleoutcomes for inflation had the economy been buffeted by the whole rangeof unforecastable outside disturbances which was typical of the period.They concluded that even if monetary policy had always been welldirected, the authorities would have had only a one-in-four chance ofhitting a 1 to 4 per cent inflation target: 'Other things equal, theseresults would argue for an inflation target band width at least as wideas that operating in the UK - and possibly much wider.'This study provides further evidence that it may be counter-productiveto express the inflation target as a range at all - be it 1 to 4 percent or 2.5 per cent and below. If the range were wide enough for evena well-intentioned policymaker to be confident of hitting the target,it would have to be so wide as to provide little gain in credibility.Finland has recognised this problem and aims simply for inflation of 2per cent. The Bank of Finland concedes that it would be impossible tohit the target precisely in any given month, except by chance. But itargues nonetheless that a single figure provides a better anchor forprivate-sector expectations than a target range.Mr King's comments and the Bank of England's advice this autumn suggestthat the authorities in the UK may be behaving as though they have apoint target for inflation slightly below 2.5 per cent - even thoughthat is not what the formal statement of the target says. If so, thechancellor would do well to rewrite his target again so that itreflects reality in a rather clearer way. *Targeting Inflation, Bank ofEngland, 1995Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MARKETS:ZAMBIA'S STOCK MARKET* ZambiaZambia's stock market will struggle to trade for the foreseeable futuredue to a growing crisis in the banking sector, analysts have said,Reuter reports from Lusaka.Several large institutions have been unable to participate in the stockexchange because their money has been tied up in four collapsedfinancial institutions.Four banks collapsed between May and November, leaving 16 in thecountry.A Rothmans of Pall Mall Zambia public offer, which closed on December7, for example, was grossly under subscribed because the pensionschemes and other institutions expected to have participated had theirmoney tied up.* ThailandThe average daily turnover on the Bangkok stock exchange in 1995 fellby 27.5 per cent from Bt8.6bn to Bt6.25bbn.Foreign trading on the SET over that period was Bt804.36bn, accountingfor 26.35 per cent of total trade.Foreign buying was worth Bt425.3bn in the period, while sellingaccounted for Bt379.03bn.* Hong KongThe Hong Kong stock exchange will review regulations on options tradingin the first quarter of 1996 and does not expect to launch new optionsduring the review period.The review would cover the proposal that market makers should be exemptfrom stamp duty when they conducted arbitrage with the spot market tospread risks.The exchange will also study changes to rules governing opening bidsand how to increase the number of market participants, including marketmakersThe exchange began listing individual stock options in September andcurrently trades options on nine stocks.* IndonesiaFurther state asset sales, an updated legal framework and automationcould mean a bright start to the year for the Jakarta stock exchange,brokers and analysts believe.The exchange switched to a fully automated trading system from manualoperations in May, after long delays.

Last year was much better than the dismalspectacle of 1994, but the last few months were characterised by the USdollar trading in a very narrow range.There is a fair amount of bullishness among currency forecasters aboutthe outlook for the dollar, though in recent years it has managed toconfound the best intended explanations for why it should rally.Analysts at Lehman Brothers think that the dollar stands to benefit inthe coming months from: perceptions that inflation has becomestructurally lower, a modest improvement in the current account deficitas a proportion of GDP, and resolution of the budget negotiations.They caution, though, that any rally could run into the buffers in thesecond half of the year, which may be dominated by a turn-round inGerman interest rate expectations.Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the dollar,forecasting levels of DM1.55 and Y112 in the next six months. Againstthe yen, their thinking is based upon trends in the trade and currentaccount data of both the US and Japan, which suggest that the bigbilateral balances between the countries are turning in the dollar'sfavour.Against the D-Mark, their thinking departs from the premise that theGerman economy is suffering from the mis-alignment of the D-Mark inEurope, and this will require the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy inorder to curb D-Mark strength.Politics will be a key variable. US presidential elections will affectthe dollar, while the progress towards monetary union in Europe willalso be an important determinant of D-Mark and Swiss franc performance.The proximity of elections in the UK, and a possible Labour government,could make life difficult for sterling.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MARKETS:LOOKING AHEAD TO BRIGHTER PROSPECTS: THE EMERGING INVESTOR / JOHN PITTThe year just ended has not been one that investors in the world'semerging equity markets will care to remember. Far better to look aheadto the brighter prospects that many strategists believe beckon in 1996.But there were some winners during 1995 - a year in which what havebecome known as the 'pre-emerging' markets came into their own.Take Jordan, for example, capitalised at less than Dollars 5bn (comparethis with Mexico's market capitalisation of about Dollars 90bn), and anannual turnover estimated at less than Dollars 1bn. (Mexico has anaverage daily turnover of at least Dollars 100m.)A far sighted investor who took a position in the country's fledglingstock market at the start of last year would have seendollar-denominated assets appreciate by 23 per cent. Compare this witha loss of 35 per cent in both India and Hungary, or 40 per cent in SriLanka.Certainly one of the prominent themes of 1995 has been the growinginterest in these pre-emerging markets: countries which are justbeginning to organise their financial structures, but are endeavouringto do so as quickly as possible.As the main emerging markets of Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey,for example, retreated in the face of a flow of funds back into thedeveloped world, so interest turned to lesser known regions. Inparticular, a race began among a number of US and European investmentbanks and brokerages to establish contacts and trading positions inAfrica. It became clear that in this 'new scramble for Africa' returnson investments could, in many cases, far exceed those in the moremature markets. But the risk would also be much greater.This did not deter the launch of a number of African funds during 1995,although most were naturally skewed towards the largest market on thecontinent - South Africa. With an estimated market capitalisation ofDollars 274bn Johannesburg is the world's seventh largest stockexchange.Russia was another growth area and some commentators believe that 1996will see this market come of age, especially after the presidentialelection is out of the way. ING Barings global strategy unit led byMichael Howell, for instance, believes that both eastern Europe andRussia show attractive valuation levels, and thinks fund managers areready to significantly increase their exposure.'Of the Dollars 50bn expected to flow towards emerging equity marketsin 1996, I expect some Dollars 5bn to head towards eastern Europe andRussia,' says Mr Howell. 'This is equivalent to more than 10 per centof existing market capitalisation, and, perhaps, as much as 25 per centof the existing free-float.'Other factors likely to lift investor sentiment in Russia include animprovement in custodial operations, with expectations that anindependent central depository will finally be created.Mr Mark Mobius, president of the Dollars 7bn Templeton Emerging MarketsFund, is another enthusiast for Russia, although he is aware that thecountry's turbulent political climate is likely to get worse before itgets any better.Nevertheless, he is confident that potential for investment is bright,given that the country has embarked on what he calls a 'revolutionary'approach to financial market reforms.But what of the core emerging markets?Mr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign & ColonialEmerging Markets based in London, believes that in spite of adisappointing return on investments in 1995 the outlook remainspositive. He picks South Korea, India, Brazil and Taiwan, among others,as having strong prospects.India, for example, continues to have good compound earnings growth, hesays.He is also among a number of strategists who favour Brazil among LatinAmerican markets.Garantia, a leading Brazilian investment bank, warns that slowereconomic growth during the first half of the year will put a brake onthe stock market's momentum; while for the year as a whole it will bevery much a matter of selecting specific sectors. Garantia favours thefood, beverage, packaging and retail sectors, on the basis that therecent decline in inflation means that many people now have adisposable income for the first time in years.At UBS the emerging markets team is keen on Chile, South Korea andTurkey, all for different reasons. Chile will continue to see animprovement in the economic picture and political problems are forecastto dissipate; South Korea is expected to benefit from an easing inmonetary policy; and Turkey should be able to move forward once againnow that the parliamentary elections are out of the way.Chile will also benefit from the increased weighting - from 1.9 percent to 7.3 per cent - which the equity market will attract in theIFC's investable index which starts this month. Mr Nigel Rendell atJames Capel, who classifies Chile as 'an Asian tiger living in LatinAmerica', forecasts that despite the recent rise in interest rates,corporate earnings will rise by 25 per cent in nominal terms, valuingthe market on a prospective p/e of 16 times.Whether or not this year will see a pick-up in activity among theworld's emerging markets depends on a host of factors, not least themovement in US interest rates. Further easing in US monetary policy,many analysts believe, could trigger a fresh wave of institutionalmoney out of the US and Europe, and into Latin America and the FarEast.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MARKETS:INVESTORS FACE A DEARTH OF ECONOMIC DATAThanks to the latest Federal government shutdown, US stock marketinvestors start the new year facing a dearth of official economic dataagainst which to judge the economy's performance.The only significant new information this week will be the NationalAssociation of Purchasing Management report for December, due today.The headline NAPM index for the month is expected by most economists tobe around 47.5 - higher than November's 46.5 but still below the50-mark which would point to expectations of manufacturing growth. Thatwould provide a firm backdrop for the bond market, whose recent gainshave underpinned share prices.While keeping one eye on bonds, the stock market will begin to fix itsattention on the corporate earnings season starting later this month.Three months ago, a generally strong set of quarterly results helpedset the stage for the stock market's fourth-quarter rise. This timearound, the figures will be pored over for signs of how the US'seconomic slowdown is affecting earnings growth.Most market followers expect earnings growth to taper off during 1996.But corporate cost-cutting and share repurchases have left plenty ofroom for earnings to come in ahead of expectations. And with USinvestors still buying mutual funds, there seems to be plenty of casharound to chase share prices higher.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MARKETS:STRATEGY   By MICHAEL MORGANThe start of the new year has brought the usual crop of recommendationsfrom brokers. Spain and Sweden feature among the lists as potentiallygood performers in 1996 while the time may now be ripe to take profitson Switzerland after its strong run last year.Views on Italy are divided, with some analysts thinking the time isright to give the market another chance but others finding thepolitical outlook still unappealing.JP Morgan expects equity markets to remain volatile, with positiveresponses to interest rate cuts probably offset in part by continuingbad news on earnings.Morgan reiterates its underweighting of Paris, saying France isexpected to experience one of the slowest growth rates in Europe nextyear. It is taking profits on a previous upgrade of the Swiss marketand switching the money into Italy, which it believes is discountingthe bad news and could react positively to a relaxation of monetarypolicy.Morgan says the low valuation on its forecasts and scope for interestrate cuts makes the Swedish market look attractive after its recentunderperformance.Lehman Brothers still recommends being overweight in the Spanish,French, Swedish and Dutch markets. It says the first two are cheap,relative to debt, while slower French growth has been more thandiscounted by the market.Sweden looks attractive on a prospective dividend basis, while theDutch market is the cheapest among the core European economies.The UK, Swiss and Italian markets remained relatively expensive.Liquidity flows had helped the first two, but value would come through.In spite of its underperformance, Lehman saw little value in Italy.ABN-Amro Hoare Govett, meanwhile, continues to prefer Germany and theNetherlands in core Europe while Spain is its peripheral market ofchoice.

A base rate cut in December, accompanied by reductions inEuropean and US interest rates, creates a positive background forequities.With most observers expecting base rates to fall further in the earlymonths of 1996, shares could yet set some more all-time highs. Whilethe FT-SE 100 index did well in 1995, it still lagged well behind WallStreet's phenomenal performance.The first test of the year will be the spring results season, not somuch for the figures themselves, but for chairmen's statements abouttrading conditions in early 1996. The market shrugged off some profitswarnings in late 1995, mainly on the hope that UK economic growth waspausing for breath, rather than grinding to a halt.As the year moves on, thoughts will inevitably turn to the date of anelection, and the chances of a Labour government.Concern will probably focus, not on macro-economic policies, but onmicro-economic matters such as the minimum wage or dividend taxation.If Labour maintains its strong lead in the opinion polls, shares maystart to come under pressure.Much went right for the UK stock market in 1995 - takeover activity, astrong Wall Street, falling bond yields and worldwide interest rates.It will be a surprise if all those factors are still as positive in1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FINANCE:CVRD MANDATE SUGGESTS END OF THE GOLDEN 3% FEE: INTERNATIONAL OFFERINGSThe debate about fees which investment banks charge for arranginginternational equity offerings is set to be a lively one in 1996,judging from the aggressive bids which emerged in the recentcompetition to win Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) mandate.Shortly before Christmas, the Brazilian government said it had chosen aconsortium including Merrill Lynch, NM Rothschild, KPMG and fourBrazilian partners to handle the sale of its 51 per cent stake in CVRD,one of the world's largest exporters of iron ore.The winning consortium is charging a fee of 1.9 per cent to arrangewhat is expected to be one of the most significant international equityofferings of 1996. According to market valuations, the government'sstake is worth about Dollars 5bn but the sale is likely to be spreadover at least two offerings.If the winners' fee looked low, it was by no means the lowest. Bankersinvolved in the bidding said a consortium led by Lehman Brothers hadoffered to do the business for a fee of 1.75 per cent and anotherincluding CS First Boston for 1.9 per cent.It is also believed the fee bid by the consortium including MorganStanley and SBC Warburg (disqualified because the first part of its feeestimate was too far below the average) was in this region.By contrast, Goldman Sachs, which had come top in the technical part ofthe bidding contest, had bid a fee of 3.125 per cent, bankers said.Bankers involved in the consortium which won the CVRD mandate say thelevel of the fee was justified because the sale will be a secondaryoffering and not an initial public offering, which usually commands ahigher fee.Half of the CVRD stock is already traded, making CVRD the mostwidely-held stock after Telebras and Petrobras. As a result, it alreadyhas a wide following among foreign analysts and investors.They also point out that there is a history of low fees in Brazil,where past international equity offerings have been done for fees ofjust over 2 per cent. But the two most important reasons bankers giveto justify the fee are: first, the size of the offering; and second,the importance of being involved in the first of many privatisations inBrazil.Although bankers do not expect the government to sell its CVRD holdingin one go, the arranging banks stand to earn close to Dollars 100m fromthe whole process.On the second point, the bidding highlighted the willingness amonginternational banks to drop their fees in order to be at the forefrontof Brazil's privatisation programme.The government wants CVRD to pave the way for further sell-offs in thecountry's electricity and telecommunications sectors over the next fewyears.The fact that three leading investment banks were willing to arrangethe CVRD sale for a fee of less than 2 per cent, despite the risksassociated with an emerging market such as Brazil, is also a reflectionof the increasingly intense competition in the international equitymarket.Once one of the most lucrative sectors of investment banking, fees forarranging deals, particularly privatisations, have been erodingsteadily over the past two years.This has come about as governments seek to maximise the proceeds ofselling off state assets and new players try to break into the market.The downward pressure on fees has been mainly on privatisations, wherethere is likely to be follow-on business for the banks, and less so oncorporate IPOs or secondary offerings. However, there are signs thatcorporate fees are also coming under pressure.In view of the ever-greater number of privatisations in Europe andelsewhere in the world and the growing number of investment bankswanting a slice of the action, it is inevitable that fee levels havebecome one of the main bargaining tools.With competition set to stiffen further, many bankers now believe thegolden 3 per cent level, once the norm for European privatisations, hasgone for good.Antonia SharpeGoldman Sachs maintained its position as the leading globalco-ordinator of international equity issues in 1995, according to datafrom Euromoney Bondware, Antonia Sharpe writes. Goldman's involvementin Germany's privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, scheduled for November,should ensure it retains the top slot in 1996. However, winning theCVRD mandate in Brazil, which is also set to emerge in the second halfof the year, has increased Merrill Lynch's chances of taking the lead.Although Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, SBC Warburg, CS First Boston,Dresdner Bank-Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Brothers remain among the top10 global co-ordinators for 1995, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Paribas andBNP have been displaced by UBS, ABN-Amro and BZW.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MARKETS:WHILE THE COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONSWhile the country's financial institutions' woes are likely to promptthe Bank of Japan to maintain an accommodating stance in its moneymarket operations, it is expected to push up interest rates on the longend.Banks are expected to step up their profit-taking on bonds and stocksahead of the March book-closing in order to cover losses stemming fromthe write-offs of bad loans.Many of the leading banks have pledged to clear their balance sheets ofbad loans related to jusen, or housing loan companies, and some haveannounced that they may fall into the red for this business year toMarch.Life insurance companies may also want to take profits on their bondholdings due to the decline in insurance premiums. While the leadinginsurers posted healthy rises in their recurring profits for the firsthalf to September, this was largely due profit-taking on theirinvestments.The seasonal repatriation of funds from the US ahead of the Marchbook-closing may briefly put upward pressure on the yen on the foreignexchanges, but this is unlikely to have a lasting impact on bondprices.Lehman Brothers in Tokyo estimates yields on the 10-year governmentbond, which closed the last year at 2.9 per cent, to end at 3.4 percent at the end of the first quarter of this year.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MARKETS:A STEP AWAY FROM CITY TRADITION: OPEN GILT REPO TRADING   By PHILIP GAWITH and RICHARD LAPPERThe launch today of the open gilt repo market may be something lessthan a 'second Big Bang', but it does represent a further step awayfrom a City where custom and tradition have played an important role,towards one governed by the more homogenised standards of a globalfinancial services industry.The privileges and arcane idiosyncracies associated with such core Cityinstitutions as gilt edge market makers (GEMMs) and stock exchangemoney brokers (SEMBs) are ebbing away.Already there is evidence of some of the more marginal GEMMs throwingin the towel, while SEMBs will have to cope with the fact that an openrepo market comes in tandem with an open stock-lending market.Ironically, the advent of the gilt repo market is beingenthusiastically welcomed by that other supposed City anachronism - thediscount house. These institutions have, for as long as anyone canremember, served as the intermediaries through which the Bank ofEngland channels liquidity to the commercial banks.Often the butt of ridicule for their quaint practice of havingemployees don top hats every morning in order to do the rounds of theCity's main banks, they have also become increasingly marginalised inrecent years as the clearing banks have gained ascendancy in the moneymarkets.More than 80 per cent of the eligible bills - those which the Bank isprepared to discount in its daily money market operations - are held bythe clearers.As a result, the role of discount houses over the past 10 years hasbeen little more than to serve as brokers on behalf of the clearingbanks.There is a widespread belief, however, that the Bank of England willstart to use the repo as its daily medium of intervention in the moneymarkets (at the moment it conducts repo operations every two weeks, butthe bulk of its daily operations are done through the bill market).This will not be immediate - the Bank will first want to see a depth ofliquidity in the repo market, both in terms of the number ofcounterparties, and the volume going through - but is believed to beinevitable.For its part, the Bank is playing a very straight bat. It said thisweek that 'it did not have plans to change the form of its money marketoperations', but that the development of gilt repo trading 'could makeit sensible to contemplate change later'.The Bank has to tread very carefully, because, in the words of oneobserver, 'any change is a sea change'.A hint that the Bank plans to start using repo alongside eligible billsin its daily operations is sure to be taken as a signal that a move tosole reliance on repo is likely.Some observers believe the Bank will try to run repo and billoperations in tandem.There are two main reasons why such a move is considered likely. First,there is widespread belief that intervening via the repo will be a moreeffective method of managing short-dated interest rates than thecurrent practice of intervening, often three times a day, via the billmarket.Second, it seems most likely to be the modus operandi of a futuresingle European central bank and the UK is unlikely to want to doanything which is at odds with what it might have to do in Europe, ifit participates in monetary union.A study last year by Mr Norbert Schnadt for the London Business Schoolfound that the money market operations of the Banque de France,Bundesbank and Federal Reserve differed from those of the Bank ofEngland in that they were conducted less frequently, utilised onlyrepurchase transactions, and were spread over a very wide range offinancial institutions.It also found that even though the Bank intervened more frequently inthe money markets than the other central banks, sterling rates weremuch more volatile than elsewhere.Recently, however, UK overnight rates have been steadier. Interventionvia repo is also unlikely, in itself, to be sufficient to makeovernight rates more stable.Any shift towards daily use of repo will be welcomed by the discounthouses, because by so doing the Bank will increase the number of activeparticipants in the money markets, diminishing the dominant role of theclearers.The introduction of an open repo market also creates a new tradinginstrument which puts more emphasis on the idea of secured money - ahigh priority in the aftermath of the Barings episode.At the moment, most secured lending and borrowing is done either to thediscount market, or via SEMBs, and through them to GEMMs.Discount houses see an opportunity in this because of their expertisein secured lending.Mr George Blunden, chief executive of Union plc, says: 'Discount houseshave a head start because our job has been secured money markets sincethe beginning of time.' As much as 95 per cent of the discount marketis secured.Mr Ross Jones, chief executive at Gerrard and National plc, adds: 'Thisis the biggest opportunity we have had for years. We see it as apotential new lease of life for the secured sterling money market.'A group like Gerrards has the added advantage of having a SEMB withinthe group, which will be merged with the discount house operations.While the pivotal role of SEMBs will be diminished, stock borrowing andlending will continue, alongside repo, so the relationships they havewill still count.A number of the largest holders of gilts - pension funds andinstitutions - have dealt exclusively with SEMBs, and early indicationsare that they will be happy to continue doing business this way.As new entrants garner market share, institutions will have to widentheir counterparties beyond the small set of SEMBs they havetraditionally dealt with, but loyalty to old relationships looks likelyto be the watchword initially.Discount houses are also confident that if the Bank of England startsto use the repo as an intervention mechanism, it will want a manageableset of counterparties, dedicated to making markets in all conditions.They believe that their chances of playing this role are good.Another development which will encourage the development of the repomarket is the introduction of the European-wide Capital AdequacyDirective, which also takes effect today. CAD encourages a securedmoney market, because the capital requirements for repos are much lowerthan for unsecured ones.Philip Gawith and Richard LapperBack to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MARKETS:THE GERMAN BOND MARKETThe German bond market market ended the year quietly but positively,with bund futures generally expected to remain firm.Inflation, now below 2 per cent, is clearly under control and economicgrowth is modest at best. Thus the Bundesbank can sit tight after itspre-Christmas interest rate cuts.With the discount rate now down to 3 per cent, the chances of a furtherreduction are rated as no more than slight by most economists.It has only once fallen below 3 per cent in the last three decades -just after the 1987 stock market crash, when it stayed at 2.5 per centfor six months.Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Union Bank of Switzerland, saidthe discount rate was not likely to fall so low in this cycle.'However,' he added, 'this does not mean that monetary easing is over.'The securities repurchase (repo) rate should fall below the current3.75 per cent. Also, the 5 per cent Lombard rate could also be lowered,since the bottom of previous cycles has seen it at 4 or 4.5 per cent.If the money supply remains weak, the Bundesbank could cut interestrates further, said Mr Bill Smyth of BHF Trust. But the 1987 discountcut to 2.5 per cent did not produce a powerful bond rally, he noted.Back to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MARKETS:ALL EYES IN THE UK GOVERNMENTAll eyes in the UK government bond market this week will be on giltsale and repurchase agreements, or repos, which starts today.'A whole new world of leverage trades, reverse repos, term stock loans,buy/sells, matched books and, hopefully, very little mayhem willtransform the gilt market,' say analysts at HSBC Greenwell.'We are entering a new evolutionary phase in the market. Repos willimpact on pricing, liquidity management, swaps, curve plays andultimately, we suspect, on official intervention in the money market.'But in the near term, trading is unlikely to be heavily affected byrepos and after trading in a narrow range last week, gilts will have tolook elsewhere for life to be breathed back into the market.The data front offers slim pickings, with M0 figures and the purchasingmanagers' report for December scheduled as the only releases this week.'M0 will be viewed with interest for what it reveals about consumerdemand in December - a month which accounts for over one-quarter oftotal annual retail sales,' notes Mr Nigel Richardson of YamaichiInternational.

Theseare developments bond investors will be pleased to see,' says Mr CraigShute, bond analyst at Bear Stearns International in London.Similar 'bond-positive' forces are visible in the US, where Treasuriesprovided investors with total returns of more than 17 per cent in 1995.And the current market rally has very different characteristics to thatof 1993, which gave way to a sell-off early in 1994.During 1993, the markets were expecting further monetary tightening -now by contrast, further cuts in interest rates are expected. Theinflation rate is falling - it was rising in 1993 - and some analystsargue that investors have yet to fully adjust their expectations to theextent of the downward trend in inflation.Mr Nigel Richardson, international bond strategist at YamaichiInternational, says US inflation - as measured by the consumer priceindex - has not been as low as its current level of 2.6 per cent since1972. The present situation 'holds out the possibility that there maybe a permanent return to 1960s-style price increases,' suggests MrRichardson.Yet according to the a survey of economic forecasts by ConsensusEconomics Inc, investors expect US inflation to rise to 3.1 per cent inthe longer term.'They are responding fully to the current inflation background on thegrounds that they appear to doubt it will be maintained. In essence,therefore, the bond market has 1980s style yields against a backgroundof 1960s style inflation,' says Mr Richardson.However, there are also good reasons to be cautious. For a start, thescale of the surge in bond prices in 1995 means much of the good newsis already reflected in valuations.Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell by nearly two percentage pointsin 1995, touching 6 per cent by the year end, while in Germany yieldson 10-year bonds had dropped to 6.07 per cent by December 27, a fall ofmore than 1.5 per cent.'With the US and European central banks virtually moving as one to cutinterest rates before year-end, most of the good news for the bondmarkets has been delivered,' says Mr Graham McDevitt, internationalbond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.Mr McDevitt predicts an increase in volatility, arguing that there is ahigh risk of a correction in the first quarter with bond yields risingby 25 to 50 basis points. Economic slowdown could also createdifficulties by undermining fiscal deficit and debt reduction schemes,in turn putting at risk the achievement of Maastricht criteria formonetary union in some countries.The impact of the slowdown will be most clearly apparent in France,where a fall in tax revenues could impair the government's efforts toreduce its fiscal deficit from the current level of more than 5 percent.The industrial action by French railway workers last month is expectedto have reduced growth in the final quarter of 1995 to 0.1 per cent.Finally, while leverage has been an element of the current bull market,it is not thought to represent as serious a threat to the markets'stability as in 1994, when highly geared trades built up in 1993 weresuddenly unwound, aggravating the extent of the sell-off.A popular geared play last year, according to analysts at BZWSecurities, was to finance purchases of US assets with yen borrowingson the grounds that the 'perceived potential for currency loss is smallrelative to the yield pick-up.'BZW says the leveraging has been concentrated on US more than Europeanbond markets and may well be limited to the short end of the Treasurycurve, though 'the impact will still have percolated along the curve.'Richard LapperBack to Headline List CopyrightTODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES (LONDON EDITION) via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996MARKETS:US TREASURIES PASSED A MILESTONEUS Treasuries passed a milestone last week. On Wednesday, the yield onthe benchmark 30-year long bond ended the day below the psychologicallysignificant 6 per cent level for the first time in two years. OnThursday and Friday, it edged down further still, closing the week -and the year - at 5.94 per cent, in marked contrast to the 7.92 percent at which it started the year.The question now is whether yields will fall further still, and WallStreet analysts believe they will. Most indicators point to a weakeningof economic growth in the coming year, further diminishing inflationarypressures.With recession an increasing possibility, analysts confidently expectthe Federal Reserve to continue to reduce the Fed funds rate, with thenext downward movement pencilled in for the Federal Open MarketCommittee meeting of January 30-31.This week, however, could be a quiet one in the bond market, for anyagreement between the president and Congress over a balanced budgetwill almost certainly come too late to allow the flow of governmentdata to resume before the weekend.Most attention is likely to focus on today's publication of theNational Association of Purchasing Managers index for December.
