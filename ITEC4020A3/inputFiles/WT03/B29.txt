The Gas Research Institute has been calling for such a groupsince its President Stephen Ban made a pitch this spring. At thetime, he hinted that the group could follow the structure of the U.S.Council for Automotive Research, an  organization formed by the BigThree automakers to perform generic, pre-market research ontechnological problems in the automotive industry.     Ban suggested that not only should the major automakers beinvolved, but also the gas industry, government agencies andequipment suppliers. Traditional defense contractors have alreadybeen making strides in developing lightweight, composite CNGcylinders, and Ban said that without such a consortium, "natural gasuse in vehicles can't fulfill its tremendous potential."     A spokesperson for the USCAR said although there's been somediscussion, the group likely would not be made part of USCAR.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Information wanted     If you know of a recent or upcoming conversion, station opening,have a new product to sell, are offering a unique service ortechnology, or are putting out a bid for NGV equipment, we want tohear from you.

As reported, GM decided to buy back or replace with a newgasoline-powered version its 1992-93 Sierra pickups that wereupfitted with a natural gas fuel system by PAS Inc., after twoincidents of fuel cylinder ruptures on those trucks earlier thisyear.      The automaker also put on hold its current program to providedual-fuel NGVs with conversion company Impco Technologies.     The automaker said in early June that of about 2,500 of the1992-93 pickups eligible for the buyback, 2,100 owners had decided onthe refund option while 400 had decided on the replacement with thegasoline version.     The largest single owner of the trucks, the General ServicesAdministration, appears to be opting for the buyback option, GM said.     GM will soon release validation specs for compressed natural gasfuel cylinders and will ask manufacturers to prove they can meetthose new specifications, said Gery Jankovits, with Chevrolet'sCommercial/Specialty group, last month at an Atlanta clean vehicleconference. Once GM is able to acquire fuel cylinders that meet thenew guidelines, they will once again offer NGVs under the Impcoprogram.     The program will start out with offerings of the Caprice,Corsica and C2500 pickups, and will expand to other models as fuelcylinders become available, Jankovits added. GM has said it hopes tobegin taking orders for NGVs by the end of the year.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Chicago joins Clean Cities ranks     Chicago became the ninth member of the Energy Dept.'s CleanCities program in May.     The program targets the replacement of one-third of existinggovernment and private fleet vehicles with alternative fuel vehicles(AFVs) by 1998.     Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, Mayor Richard Daley andexecutives from 50 transportation and energy companies in asix-county region signed the partnership agreement. The city hasannounced it is fuel-neutral, and has tested natural gas,electricity, ethanol and soy-diesel as vehicle fuels.     The group has targeted 1,000 vehicle conversions per year, andconstruction of 80 refueling stations.     The overall goal of the Clean Cities program is to have 250,000AFVs on the road and 1,000 stations installed in 50 cities across thenation by 1996.     Other member cities include Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Denver, LasVegas, Philadelphia, Washington and Wilmington, Del.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994GRI suggests steps to prevent NGV tank failures     The Gas Research Institute (GRI) has proposed a three-partapproach to preventing the kind of natural gas vehicle (NGV) fueltank ruptures that were seen earlier this year on GMC Sierra pickups.     As reported, fuel cylinders on two Sierras owned by utilitiesruptured during or just after the refueling process early this year.The culprit was later found to be acids that had corroded the fiberoverwrap on the cylinders, causing the overwrap to crack.     As a result of investigations by the Southwest ResearchInstitute and GRI's own program, GRI is recommending the following:     * Modification of the shield that protected the cylinder fromstones and other road debris. The stone shield on the Sierra's actedas a "bathtub" according to some sources, trapping liquids andkeeping them against the cylinder.     * Using cylinder coatings that have proved to be acid-resistant.     * A program for NGV operators that increases awareness of theeffects of acid on uncoated, composite-wound cylinders and encouragesimproved maintenance and safer handling of cylinders.     In both instances, it was found that acid had leaked from thetruck beds through bolt holes drilled into the beds to hold the fuelcylinders underneath the truck. At Pacific Gas & Electric, the acidleaked from used batteries carried in the truck bed. At Minnegasco,the source of the acid was undetermined, although it was speculatedto have been cleaning solutions or fertilizer carried in the bed.     Contrary to initial rumors, GRI said that neither road salt norwater were a factor in the failures.     GRI recommended the following for current NGV users:     * Immediately inspect cylinders for stress corrosion cracking.     * Periodically inspect cylinders using manufacturer guidelineson visual inspections of cylinders.     * Ensure that installations avoid acidic-fluid contact withcylinders and that users are aware of the impact of acids oncylinders.     * For operators who add cylinders, ensure that cylinders aremounted so that any continuous immersion in fluids is minimized.     GRI is distributing the guidelines to its member companies, toparticipants in a recent GRI-sponsored NGV workshop and through theNatural Gas Vehicle Coalition.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Kit makers work to meet CARB durability tests     The standoff between the conversion industry and Californiaregulators over how to meet aftermarket kit durability regulationshas ended with at least three major natural gas conversion companiesplanning to meet the requirements, industry sources tell NGV News.     Under the rule, which went into effect Jan. 1, conversioncompanies that wish to remain CARB-certified by the California AirResources Board (CARB) must have 15% of their engine family kits meeta 100,000 mile durability test by the end of the year. In 1995, thepercentage increases to 55% and by 1996, all aftermarket conversionsmust meet the standard.     The regulation affects the entire aftermarket conversionindustry because companies that do not sell equipment in Californiaoften market products to other states and the federal government,which require CARB certification as a condition of the contract.     But as recently as last October, conversion companies said theycouldn't provide any emissions data until CARB clarified what kind ofdurability tests would qualify (NGVN 10/93). Meanwhile, CARBregulators blamed program delays on manufacturers waiting to seewhich engine families would be sought by fleet customers.     Since then, the board and several conversion companies haveworked out a system that both parties agree on. Natural gas interestsattribute part of this new spirit of cooperation to the presence thisterm of four new board members and a new chairperson who have madethe staff more supportive of industry efforts.     According to Greg Vlasek of the California Natural Gas VehicleCoalition, Impco, GFI Control Systems and Mogas all intend to meetthe durability standard by submitting data generated from100,000-mile road tests designed to simulate deterioration. In March,CARB gave Impco and GFI the green light to perform the tests;meanwhile, the board is negotiating with Mogas on a procedure.     Impco says 38 engine family kits will be approved in '94,including some for liquefied propane as well as CNG, companyofficials say. In addition, the company will certify up to fourengine families as an OEM in 1995, says Impco Director of EngineeringSyed Hussain.     Other conversion kit companies such as GFI plan to sell 11 CNGconversion kits with CARB approval. Mogas wants to sell six enginefamily kits for propane users only. To be certified, conversioncompanies must present their data to CARB by October. Certificationshould occur two months later, a CARB official told NGV News.     The track tests, which cost $150,000 per vehicle to perform, arean expensive way to meet CARB's requests but are the only practicalmethod now available to the industry, says Vlasek. The only otheroption is to submit benchmark test protocols like the Big Three dofor OEM conversions. While ideally this would cost less money pervehicle, the expense of testing dozens of vehicles is still toogreat, and similar data held by automakers is proprietary, Vlaseksaid.     "Certification has proved to be much more costly than anyoneanticipated," he said. "It's a tremendous burden on the industry. Wejust want the same level playing field that the OEMs have right now."     As one of the largest aftermarket conversion companies, Impco isshouldering a lot of that cost, but company officials say it'snecessary for market credibility.     "CARB is doing the right thing. Emission standards need to bestrict for everyone for the industry to be credible," says Impco'sHussain, who predicts that in five years aftermarket conversiondemand will still be strong, "but a lot of those fly by-nighters willhave left."     And even natural gas supporters admit that from CARB's point ofview, the stringent certification process for aftermarket kits makessense: if something goes wrong with a retrofit system, many companiescould not afford a major recall like the Big Three can. Instead, theywould go bankrupt before being able to fix a defect, and motoristswould have little recourse.     "By ensuring product safety and emissions controls up front, itwill save time and money down the road," notes Vlasek.     Looking to the future, natural gas interests in California hopein 1995 to work with local gas utilities to come up with a benchmarktest in order to avoid the more laborious route of testing vehicleson a track for durability. The coalition is hoping that CARB willallow emissions data from one vehicle to be carried over to othervehicles that share similar engines and emission controls. OEMs arealready allowed to go this route, but natural gas interests are stillwaiting for an OK from the board.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Seattle LNG buses axed; support vehicles eyed     Seattle politicos have put the kibosh on the city's ambitiousprogram to convert its transit buses to run on liquefied natural gas(LNG), but the local government is studying other vehicles forpossible conversion to natural gas.     On May 9, the Metropolitan King County Council passed, on an 8-2 vote, an ordinance that would cancel contracts the local transitagency had with Bus Industries of America and Liquid Carbonic, forconstruction of an LNG plant and 810 buses by 2000 (NGVN 5/94, 4/94).     After conducting a two-year study of alternative fuels, SeattleMetro last July recommended LNG for its buses. But since thatdecision, the city and county governments in Seattle agreed to merge,Seattle Metro lost its status as an independent agency and moreconservative officials took the reins of the local government. Thosenew officials thought the cost of the LNG program too high, and optedinstead to spend money expanding routes and adding more conventionalbuses.     One Seattle Metro official said what killed the program was"happy talk ... That's what killed the bus program ... we got lots ofhappy talk from legislators, the bus builders, the gas industry ...but when it came time to sign the check, all the happy talk wasgone."     It's now up to the lawyers to decide what costs have beenincurred so far and how Liquid Carbonic and Bus Industries will becompensated. A Liquid Carbonic official said just after the decisionhe had not been officially notified of the cancellation and couldn'tcomment.     Seattle Metro will continue observing technological and economicdevelopments in the industry and will likely take another look atalternative fuels in two years, said Jim Boone, Metro's maintenancesupervisor. Boone had said earlier they might try to use some of thefederal funding they received for the LNG buses to keep BusIndustries on as the builder of the new diesel buses.     The alternative fuels cost issue also could stymie efforts bythe county government and Seattle Metro to convert more supportvehicles to natural gas and propane, Boone said.     The county government has identified about 1,800 supportvehicles, light-duty vehicles up to one ton, which could be convertedto alternative fuels, specifically natural gas. They're puttingtogether a feasibility study on such issues as conversion costs andrefueling station needs, and expect to release the results soon.     King County already has 175 vehicles operating on CNG, 75 ofthose police cruisers, and has built two refueling stations. A thirdstation, a joint venture of the city and county governments, is underconstruction, noted Windell Mitchell, a fleet official with KingCounty.     One of the things stopping additional station construction isthe consolidation of local government. Sites that would be ideal forthe county to build a station on are targeted for annexation by thecity in the next two years, Mitchell noted.     County officials also recently met with representatives from 14public and private fleet operators in the area, including Microsoftand Boeing. They've all expressed at least some interest in NGVs, andBP Oil has indicated it would be interested in building some stationsif the market is right, Mitchell said.     Mitchell pointed out one disappointment they've had recentlyafter the General Services Administration decided that the AFV fleetvehicles it would place in the area will be fueled by methanol.Mitchell said the decision seemed "strange" since there's noinfrastructure for methanol in the area and other fleet operatorsseem more interested in NGVs.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994NGV producers form association     A group of natural gas vehicle (NGV) producers have formed a newassociation to share information and costs involved in bringing NGVsto market.     The NGV Producers Association's first contract involves sharingthe cost of engineering and test services to qualify under Ford'sQualified Vehicle Modifier (QVM) program.     Under the QVM program, Ford hopes to qualify companies toperform upfits on new vehicles to run on natural gas and sell themthrough Ford dealerships. The conversion companies must meet certainrequirements and guidelines to join, and pay their own expenses,including testing.     The first model the association is developing under the QVMprogram is the Ford F-series pickup.     The association is based in Washington, D.C., with Wayne Smithserving as managing director. Board members include John Bacon,president of TDM World Conversions Ltd., Steven Laden, vice presidentof Southern Union Gas, and Howard Phelan, chairman of NGV Systems.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Canada extends incentive program     Canada's Natural Resources Minister Anne McLellan has announcedthe country is restarting an incentive program for NGVs to help boostthe natural gas industry and help the environment.     The Market Development Incentive Payment Fund provides C$1000toward the purchase of a new NGV or the cost of conversion. Forrefueling stations, even those designated for home use, C$500 isavailable. And up to 25% of the capital cost, or up to $50,000, isavailable to distributors who install public or private refuelingstations.     The program is funded by a fee from Alberta gas producers andeach provincial government. About C$15 million is left over from theoriginal C$160 million collected for the program in the 1980s.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Logo clouds relations between cab company, D.C. agency     Disagreement over a logo is fouling relations between theDistrict of Columbia's Taxicab Commission and a company that operatesa fleet of vehicles powered by natural gas.     Some 10 months after Clean Air Cab began operations amidenthusiastic expressions of support from the Clinton administrationand Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, the atmosphere in the nation's capitalhas become decidedly less cordial for the company (NGVN 7/93, 3/93,2/93).     The commission has issued an order demanding that Clean Air Cabeither change its logo or shut down, according to the company's vicepresident, Dave Moederndorfer.     At issue is whether Clean Air Cab will abandon its trademarksymbols of a white, fluffy cloud and the perennial little blue flame.The commission has ordered it to do so, calling the logo misleading,but the company has refused.     Commission Chair Karen Jones Herbert also has accused thecompany of false advertising, according to Moederndorfer, because itscabs bear the assertion that they are powered by natural gas eventhough they are dual-fuel, or capable of running on either naturalgas or gasoline.     Neither Herbert nor other members of the commission responded totelephone calls from NGV News seeking comment on the agency's stancein the controversy.     Clean Air Cab could have its five-car fleet booted or towed andbe fined $500 per day if it refuses to repaint or reconfigure thecabs, according to the order, which was issued in late May.     "We feel that [the order is] impeding free enterprise and freespeech," Moederndorfer said. "We don't know of anybody that haspatented a white cloud as a statement in general, and the blue flameis an international symbol for natural gas."     He also dismissed the commission's assertion that the wording onthe cabs is misleading. "How can we mislead and confuse when we dorun on natural gas?" he asked, adding that the company receives freegas from Washington Gas Light as part of the deal that led the ownersto create the company.     Moederndorfer added that Clean Air Cab had received aninterest-free technology loan from Consolidated Natural Gas inPittsburgh and price concessions for vehicles from Ford and GeneralMotors, which want to showcase their products with cleaner fuels.     In addition, Clean Air Cab passed "very rigorous testing" by theenvironmental group Green Seals, which found that the cabs run onnatural gas 96% of the time, he said. The other 4% represents drivingthe cars to Martinsburg, W.Va., for repairs when a problem occurswith the natural gas system, he added.     The company is far from cowed by the commission's actions,however.     "We have sent a letter of appeal to the commission, to which Ihave not heard any response," Moederndorfer said recently.     In addition to continuing operating the cars it has on the road,Clean Air Cab intends to go forward with plans to add 10 moredual-fuel vehicles to its fleet soon, he said.     But the heady days when the company's cabs glided down thedistrict's streets as part of President Clinton's inaugural paradeand Kelly presented it with its first license plate are gone.     Today, it's more like a war of attrition with a commission thatMoederndorfer thinks may be motivated as much by a fear ofcompetition for traditionally fueled cabs from cleaner fuels as byconcern for consumers.     "We are promoting the use of natural gas," he said. "I thinkthey see us as a competitive threat."Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Fleets disappointed with alternative fuel progress     ATLANTA -- Fleet owners still have many concerns about switchingtheir vehicles to alternative fuels, and that could spell a longerwait for those companies hoping to cash in on the natural gas vehicle(NGV) market.      Patsy Brownson, president of the National Assn. of FleetAdministrators (NAFA), told the Clean Air Vehicle conference lastmonth that these problems need to be addressed to encourage thewidespread use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs).     "Fleets hold a key to the successful change to cleanervehicles," Brownson said. Fleets are the ones targeted by federal andstate mandates to use alternative fuels. Brownson speaks for 2,300fleet managers who are members of NAFA, representing about 3 millionvehicles in the United States and Canada.     Those wanting to sell alternative fuels should remember that themajority of fleet operators don't have mechanics or garages oron-site refueling, Brownson noted. The reason they have fleets at allis to provide more efficient  transportation for their company'sbusiness at a lower cost.     She outlined six areas of concern:     * Aftermarket conversions. Many fleets have tried conversionsand run into operational trouble, Brownson said. NAFA is hoping thatthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will require morereliability and durability from converted vehicles in its final ruleon aftermarket conversions, expected to be issued soon. "Until theseconversions become more reliable... fleets will be reluctant to usethem," and will continue to overwhelmingly prefer original equipmentvehicles, she said.     * Utility. Fleets can't afford to lose trunk space or operatevehicles that only get an 85-mile range, she said. And fleet managersneed more choices of models too -- not just the pickups, vans andlarge sedans typically available now.     * Convenience and efficiency. More refueling time is usuallyneeded with AFVs, and since refueling stations are still scarce,there's also productive work time lost locating those stations, sheexplained.     * Reliability. A business can't use vehicle problems as anexcuse for missing appointments or deadlines.     * High cost. "A good fleet manager struggles to shave a fewhundred dollars from the purchase or lease price of a vehicle. So canyou imagine the response from top management when someone says thenew vehicles will cost $2,500 more? Or even $1,000 more?" she asked.     * Need for more real-world data. Fleets are hungry for more dataon the daily use of AFVs, and NAFA is encouraging its own members, aswell as the EPA and Energy Dept. to compile lots more case studies onhow these vehicles perform in sales, service and delivery fleets,Brownson said.     There are and will be AFV fleet success stories, Brownson added.But most of those successes happen at larger companies with in-housemechanics, engineers, on-site or numerous off-site refueling stationsand forward- thinking management.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994King County forges ahead with NGV conversions     Despite some setbacks mainly caused by political forces in thearea, Seattle's King County has established natural gas as itsalternative fuel of choice and is working to expand its NGV fleet.     Last year, King County's Vehicle Service Manager WindellMitchell was seeking out other fleets, particularly police fleets,that were operating NGVs. Today, with 175 NGVs in King County'sfleet, other managers are seeking out Mitchell.     About 75 of those NGVs are police cruisers, and the rest are ahodgepodge of service vehicles like vans, pickups and sedans. Theyall retain the capability to use gasoline and most were convertedusing Technocarb kits. Those kits have cost about $4,000 each withfuel tanks, and another $400 each for the newer version withelectronics, Mitchell said. The vehicles are getting about 115 milesper fill- up on average, he added.     The county has two fast-fill refueling stations, each costingabout $325,000 and capable of handling 300 vehicle. A third station,in a joint venture with the city of Seattle, is planned that willhandle 750 vehicles. King County is getting its gas for about 52cents/equivalent gallon at the sites now.     One factor hindering plans for expansion of the fleet has been adecision to merge the county and city governments in Seattle, whichwill be a phased-in process.     For instance, the county wanted to convert the police cruisersat a certain precinct on the county's edge, but decided not to sincethat precinct will be one of the first annexed by the city in 1996.     King County is conducting a study of how it could proceed withmore NGV conversions. It has identified 1,807 vehicles, alllight-duty, up to one ton, that are likely candidates for conversion,out of a total fleet of about 3,200 vehicles.     The big concern is the county's budget. As Ellen Bevington,supervisor of capital program management for the county, explained,it will be difficult to plan for more conversions in the countybudget over the next two years. With city annexations andincorporation, the county will be losing more of its tax base.     Another recent decision that doesn't bode well for more light-duty conversions is a vote by the newly elected, more conservativecounty council to cancel Seattle Metro's conversion from diesel toLNG buses. The council called the project too expensive, and decidedto spend money on adding more diesel buses and expanding Metro'sroutes. The similarities between the Metro project and the light-dutyvehicle project are "eerie," Bevington added.     The study on that light-duty vehicle projected is beingfinalized now and will be forwarded to the county executive soon.     *Amoco Oil and Washington Gas have opened their refuelingstation in the nation's capitol to the public. Previously, onlyfleets involved in demonstration projects with the utility had usedthe station, which is located at 9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,S.E. CNG is selling at the station for 84.9  cents/equivalent gallon.     * Amoco Oil also opened two more public stations in the Atlantaarea last month, bringing the Amoco station count in that city toseven. The new stations are on Franklin Road near Dobbins Air ForceBase in Marietta and on Old Dixie Highway, near I-285 in Forest Park.     * The Georgia Building Authority has opened Georgia's largestNGV refueling station in Atlanta to serve the state motor pool. Morethan 140 state vehicles have already been converted to natural gasand will be refueled at the station.     * Atlanta Gas Light is supplying natural gas and equipment tothe station under its promotional V-52 rate. The state will begetting gas for about 50 cents/equivalent gallon.     * Montana-Dakota Utilities has opened a second public station inBismarck, N.D. The facility is at a Sinclair gasoline station ownedby D&J Enterprises, on the city's north side near a majorintersection with I-94.     Montana-Dakota itself has converted 250 vehicles, or more thanhalf its fleet, to run on natural gas. About 250 other vehicles havebeen converted in the utility's service area and are using itsnetwork of 13 NGV stations.     * Birmingham. Ala., got its first NGV station last month as partof a joint venture between Alagasco and Sonat Ventures. The stationis at 200 West Oxmoor Road and is designed to handle 150 vehicles perday.     * East Ohio Gas is planning a three-year, $2.5 million upgradeof its 12 NGV stations in northeast Ohio. The company plans toinstall new dryers, meters, card readers and dispensers, as well asreplacing DOT dispensers with ASME vessels at each fast-fill stationand improving compressor output for a faster fill. As part of theprogram, East Ohio also will upgrade its vehicles, replacing 2400 psicylinders with 3600 psi tanks.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994L.A. Airport commits to LNG; SoCal to build station     The Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) will be the site forCalifornia's first liquefied natural gas (LNG) refueling station asthe airport embarks on a plan to convert all of its fleet to naturalgas.     Southern California Gas won a one-year contract to build atemporary station and provide LNG, which will initially be shipped infrom Wyoming, said Lloyd Klefstad, chief of construction andmaintenance for the airport. The station will consist of two tanks,with a total 10,500 gallon capacity, mounted on two skids with a pumpin between and a completion date of June.     The station will be a temporary one until a larger, permanentfacility is built to handle the growing fleet. The airport will pay$8,000/month for the SoCal station, with Klefstad estimating fuelcosts at 67 cents/gallon.     LAX has ordered 14 LNG buses from Gillig Bus Co. and plans tobuy eight more in the next fiscal year. The Gillig buses should bedelivered beginning in June. Funding for the first 14 buses, at$255,000 each, is coming out of the airport's budget. The South CoastAir Quality Management District is providing a grant to cover thedifference between the conventional and LNG bus cost for the nexteight buses, Klefstad said.     LAX opted for LNG for its buses, due to range and weightconcerns with compressed natural gas (CNG). The Gillig buses willcarry a single LNG tank, and have a range of about 300 miles.     The airport is considering several options for the permanent LNGstation, and has been talking to the local Metropolitan TransitAuthority (MTA) and other local bus fleets about making the permanentstation public. MTA is already planning to buy 75 LNG buses for itsown fleet.     SoCal said its interest in helping build a permanent stationand/or an LNG plant for the area depends on the success of thetemporary station and the success of LNG in general in capturing areafleets.     The permanent station also may serve as an LNG-to-CNG refuelingstation. LAX is considering converting its light-duty vehicles toCNG. United Airlines already has some vehicles running on CNG at theairport, and is making its refueling station available to airportauthority vehicles.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Industry addresses NGV problems at workshop     Innovators unveiled strategies to overcome natural gas vehicles'(NGV) most formidable obstacles at the first-ever advanced componentsworkshop for NGVs.     The conference was hosted by the Defense Dept.'s AdvancedResearch Project Agency to provide insight on technological advancesfor NGVs. The Commerce Business Daily is expected to publish a broadagency announcement sometime this month requesting proposals forproject funding, which will be open to the industry.     "We're finally getting NGV people to talk to each other," saidSteve Scharf of System Planning Corp., a support contractor for ARPA.Another participant said the industry will now have the opportunityto network and link new components yielding a vehicle "that is twiceas good."     Participants presented hi-tech proposals to increase on-boardstorage, improve fuel sensor and control systems, facilitate naturalgas compression and home refueling and enhance vehicle performance,range and safety.     Stephen Takagishi, Gas Research Institute executive technologymanager for NGVs, said it is critical for the future of natural gasvehicles that the industry cut in half the cost of fueling stationsand storage cylinders and find ways to increase safety through fuelconsistency sensor systems.     A Los Angeles-based firm, NGV/USA, told participants it hassolved the range problem by designing the first vehicle specificallyincorporating natural gas cylinders into the frame. The result is achassis platform that can travel 800 to 1,000 miles between fueling.     Although there is nothing technologically unique about theplatform, designer Nick Pugh said, the secret is in the design, whichwas built from the ground up with NGVs in mind. He described thetwo-piece "sandwich" platform as a "tight, well-designed egg crate"that houses four tanks and holds about 35 gallons equivalent ofgasoline.     "Other natural gas vehicle manufacturers are solving the rangeproblem on a component-by-component basis and that's great. But ouridea is to create a vehicle layout which utilizes all these specificcomponents, particularly the cylinders."     The versatile chassis platform may house a mini-van, pickuptruck, full-size van or a box van. Energy-absorbing end caps and sideimpact rails surrounding the cylinders provide safety mechanisms.     The program will cost $1 million, and it will take about 12-18months to complete the prototype. NGV/USA, a member of CALSTART, saidit believes it will be able to raise matching funds for half theprogram cost.     Anti-ballistic missile technology spawned during the Reagan StarWars era is serving a liquefication apparatus that will convertmethane at a fraction of the startup cost of a big plant, said DavidBruderly of Bruderly Associates, which is developing the product withCryenco Sciences.     The TADOPTR (thermo acoustic driver orifice pulse tuberefrigeration) uses acoustic energy rather than the industrial-sizedcompressors, bearings and seals used in large conversion plants. Theresulting apparatus will need less maintenance because it has noworking parts or seals. It may be built for less than $1 million, andwill produce about 10,000 gallons a day.     "To make LNG at a big plant you have to invest $40 million,"Bruderly said. "It has not been cost-effective to make smallquantities of LNG using existing technology." But the TADOPTR makesit possible by producing LNG for 40 cents a day, he added.     Bruderly is working also with Hydrogen Consulting to formulate a"high-test" CNG fuel which reduces overall vehicle emissions. Byadding 15% hydrogen to the fuel volume, they have created "hythane"at only a slightly higher cost than plain natural gas.     "The EPA has performed tests and documents that hythane is 25%cleaner than straight natural gas," especially during accelerationtests that simulate passing and cold starts, Bruderly said.     San Diego-based BKM Inc. said it has solved the problem of fuelinconsistencies by designing a gas quality sensor which uses soundmeasurements to control engine functions. Software in the system willmake adjustments to instantly compensate for variations in fuelcomposition and quality.     "What's unique is not necessarily measuring the speed of sound,"said BKM President Bill Johnson, "but what we do with the sensoryoutput, to use it to control engine functions."     An NGV fuel sensor system developed by Aerojet utilizes the sametechnology that was used in the space shuttle to monitor exhaust anddetect leaks. Aerojet's sensor uses microelectronics to predeterminethe hydrocarbon, or energy content, of the fuel prior to combustion.     The sensor works in tandem with data fusion technology, so thatthe fuel mix may be appropriately adjusted, reducing emissions. Othersensors which are commonly calometric are 20% to 40% less accurateand not as fast as the microeletric sensor, said Marvin Young,Aerojet director of technology.     Kennedy Space Center is designing an energy-independentcompressed natural gas (CNG) fueling center to eventually service itsfleet of 1,200 tour buses, light duty and heavy equipment vehicles.However, mechanical engineer Bobbie Surmans said the solar-poweredstructure has been "expensive and difficult to design," and she hasnot yet determined whether the project will be economically viable.     Other technology presented at the workshop included:     * A compact driveway appliance that can refuel an NGV in eighthours designed for home and non-combat military vehicles, designed byWestern Research and General Pneumatics.     * An energy-independent natural gas compressor, which producesCNG or LNG faster and more inexpensively than other compressors whilealso being 80% smaller, presented by Marius Paul of Engine Corp. ofAmerica.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Power plant emissions fuel AFV debate     Two recent studies have come up with conflicting views about theemissions benefits of different alternative fuel vehicles.     As reported last month, Energy International performed a studyfor the Gas Research Institute (GRI) that found NGVs run neck andneck with electric vehicles (EVs) in measuring air quality benefits,once you take into account the emissions from power plants thatproduce electricity for EVs (NGVN 5/94).     But a recent World Resources Institute (WRI) study found thatcarbon-based fueled vehicles don't do enough to curb tailpipepollutants. WRI is a research group that backs renewable energy.     The WRI report stated that substituting methanol or ethanol forgasoline could actually result in higher levels of ozone, and wouldnot reduce production of greenhouse gases believed to cause globalwarming.     Compressed natural gas vehicles didn't fare much better, saidWRI report author James MacKenzie. The group found that while NGVsreduce both carbon monoxide and smog levels when compared totraditional vehicles, the methane they emit is also a greenhouse gas.     The reports were released at a critical point in the CaliforniaAir Resources Board's (CARB) review of its low-emission vehiclestandards. It adds weight to California's new air quality requirementthat 2% of vehicles sold in the state beginning in 1998 must bezero-emission -- a standard that only EVs are capable of meeting atthis time.     The Energy International study found that Chrysler's 1994dedicated CNG vans, minivans and wagons are not only environmentallycomparable to electric vehicles but can even outperform them onnitrogen oxide, sulfuric oxides and particulate matter emissions.     The study found that NGVs may even be superior to electric inthe Northeast, where utility companies burn greater concentrations ofcoal, said Ken Darrow, Energy International chief analyst.      However, MacKenzie contends that power companies will notcontribute more sulfur emissions while generating electricity to fuelelectric vehicles because "total sulfur-dioxide emissions are cappedby the 1990 Clean Air Act." MacKenzie adds that power companies willuse more scrubbers or lower sulfur coal to generate the electricityused to fuel EVs.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Equipment Update     * The California Energy Commission (CEC) has awarded $300,000 infunding under its Transportation Energy Technologies AdvancementProgram to CALSTART for development of three hybrid electric/naturalgas buses.     CALSTART has garnered $830,830 in matching funds for theproject. The bus will use a rapid opportunity charger with anauxiliary natural gas- powered unit to provide more energy forclimbing hills or pulling onto freeways.     * The CEC also awarded $607,569 in funding to Dyna-Cam AeroEngine Corp. for conversion of the company's lightweight Dyna-Camaviation engine to run on natural gas. The company will provide $1.4million in matching funds for the project. The Dyna-Cam engine isonly 20% of the weight and 25-33% of the volume of a conventionaldiesel engine. Once running on natural gas, the engine is expected tomeet ultra-low emission levels and will be designed for transitapplications.     * Energy Kinetics of Naperville, Ill., has announced that itsnew Model EK- 110-1-V pressure sensor is now available to OEMmanufacturers for use in upgrading previously installed CNG ordual-fuel monitoring and control systems.

The Ohio Energy Strategy Task Force consists of officials from18 state agencies. In developing the energy plan, they made severalsuggestions for encouraging AFVs in Ohio:     * AFV equipment makers should be encouraged to move into thestate.     * Ohio Dept. of Transportation should expand the activities ofthe state Alternative Fuels Advisory Council.     * Ohio Commerce Dept. should review safety standards for AFVs;and     * The governor's office should monitor the number of AFVs in thestate fleet.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994DOE opens coffers for clean fuel programs     The Dept. of Energy (DOE) is releasing some funds foralternative fuel vehicles (AFV) conversions to state and localgovernment fleets.     One program involves the release of $924,000 in funding for thepurchase of heavy-duty AFVs by state and municipal agencies. CleanCities participants are being given an edge in qualifying, sincebeing a member automatically gives those cities 40 of the 100selection criteria points.     The grants are to be awarded by state agencies and will coverthe incremental cost of buying up to four vehicles powered by naturalgas, methanol, ethanol, propane or bio-diesel. Awards will be made bySept. 30. For more information, contact your state energy office.

Va. assembly considers NGV bills     The West Virginia legislature is considering two newlyintroduced bills designed to advance alternative fuel vehicle use inthe state.     Senate Bill 401 would exempt alternative motor vehicle fuelsfrom the state's gasoline and special fuel excise tax. State, county,municipal or agency fleets would be 100% exempt indefinitely. Butother AFV owners would only be exempt for 10 years. After that, theexemption would be phased out over three years.     The other legislation, House Bill 4599, would increase theschool aid formula for funding the operation of alternative fuelbuses to 100%. Currently, schools in West Virginia can get fundingfor 80% of the fuel and operating costs for all buses, includingconventional gasoline or diesel-powered versions.     But HB 4599 reasons that since natural gas and some otheralternative fuel buses are cheaper to operate, the state can cover100% of their fuel and other operating costs without actually payingout more money to the schools.     The West Virginia NGV Coalition has been aggressively supportingthe bills, asking members to participate in the hearings and domailings to their senators and delegates.     Both of the bills were still in committee in early March, withonly about 10 days left in the legislative session.

"The board basically didn't respond to it," said Jerry Martin, aCARB spokesperson.     Southern California Gas Co. offered testimony before the boarddetailing how natural gas-powered vehicles are the practicalequivalent to electric vehicles when power plant emissions areconsidered. This was based on the GRI- sponsored study by EnergyInternational, Inc. focusing on "full fuel cycle emissions"associated with natural gas vehicles and electric vehicles inSouthern California (NGVN 5/94).     Yet, when the issue was raised, Martin said, staffers told theboard that a primary concern with any internal combustion engine isits tendency to pollute more with aging and thus lose its"equivalence" to electric vehicles. Electric vehicle "emissions" donot deteriorate over time.     Martin also said that when citing these "full cycle" studies,representatives often fail to consider emissions generated from"getting the dinosaurs out of the ground."     But the board does recognize the improvement of NGVs over othercombustion engines, he said, they simply did not act on the proposalto group them as "equivalents" to electric vehicles.     * NGVs aren't the only ones. Ford Motor has been investigatingsome mysterious battery fires in two electric-powered Ecostarvehicles, according to United Press International.     The first fire occurred on May 2 as the battery in an Ecostarleased by the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif.,burst into flames. The second fire happened in El Monte, Calif.,where an Ecostar at the California Air Resources Board caught on firewhile being recharged.     Ford has parked all 34 Ecostars until it has completed aninvestigation being conducted with battery supplier ABB ofMississauga, Ontario. The investigation is focusing on the cells ofthe sodium-sulfur battery.     * The Dept. of Transportation (DOT) is soliciting comments on aproposal to alter the Congestion Mitigation and Air QualityImprovement Program (CMAQ) so that funding would be available forprivate projects. About $6 billion in funds is available from 1992-97for alternative fuel and other  transportation projects under CMAQ.Written comments are due to June 20 under the Federal HighwayAdministration/Federal Transit Administration Docket No. 94-11.     * The American Petroleum Institute (API) has filed a complaintwith the Federal Trade Commission, charging that some recent adsbeing placed by agricultural interests are deceptive and misleading.     The complaint centers on ads placed in major nationalpublications by a group called "Agriculture for Clean Air" and theIllinois Farmers Union, which cautions the public against usinggasoline additives that contain MTBE. API is especially miffed at howthe ads seem to imply that methanol, which is highly toxic, is thesame as MTBE.     "The ad fails to mention that vehicles using ethanol or ETBEemit more air toxics than those using MTBE when blended to anequivalent oxygen content in the fuel," API said. "In addition,emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, the precursors ofsmog, are higher from vehicles using ethanol blends," API's complaintsaid.     * EDO Corp. said its Canadian subsidiary EDO Canada has receiveda C$2.1 million order from Ontario Bus Industries (OBI)/BusIndustries of America for EDO's LiteRider all-composite NGV fuelcylinders. They will be roof-mounted on OBI's new Orion VI low-floorbuses. The seven-cylinder configuration should add less than 1,200lbs. of weight to the vehicle. Comparable steel cylinders would haveadded more than 3,500 lbs. and overwrapped aluminum cylinders wouldhave added more than 3,000 lbs. compared to the LiteRider, EDO said.     * The West Virginia Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition said it haswon the U.S. Dept. of Energy's 1994 National Awards Program forEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy for its efforts in opening anetwork of 12 NGV stations in the state. Seven more stations arescheduled to open before the end of the year.     * The American Public Transit Association reports that about8.2% of 52,000 U.S. buses counted in a recent survey are powered byalternative fuels, up from 5.9% last year.     Of the 4,285 buses reported as using alternate power, almosthalf use clean diesel with particulate traps, 22% are electric andthe majority of the rest runs on CNG, methanol and fuel combinations.At least 1,300 more clean fuel buses are expected to be in service inthe next two years.     * The Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlookfor 1994 forecasts a drop in gasoline consumption as a result ofincreased alternative fuel use. The decrease is expected to be 6%from 1990 to 2010, according to EIA.     The agency forecasts that AFVs will compose 2.3% of light-dutyvehicle sales in 1995; 10.6% in 2005 and 11.4% in 2010.     In 2010, sales are predicted to be 26.4% CNG; 19.4% LPG; 12.2%electric; 17.8% electric hybrid; 13% methanol and gasoline; and 8.6%methanol and gasoline.Back to Headline List CopyrightNGV NEWS via NewsNetJUNE 1994Utilities need to support NGV market, official says     CNG appears to be the leading choice for a low-cost, low-emission alternative fuel, but utilities need to take advantage ofwhat natural gas has to offer, said John Stark, director of fleetservices for Brooklyn Union Gas.     Speaking at the American Gas Assn. operations conference in SanFrancisco last month, Stark said many utility employees have stock intheir companies and want to see them grow, but utilities keep buyinggasoline for their fleets rather than natural gas.     "No utility that I know of sells gasoline," he said. Utilitiesspend thousands of dollars to advertise on the advantages of naturalgas, pointing out in the ads that it is low-priced, morecleaner-burning than oil and domestically produced, Stark said.However, when it comes to fleets, utilities use fuel which isimported, high- priced, volatile and emits toxic pollutants, headded.     Stark acknowledges that some fleet managers were waiting for OEMvehicles before getting involved in NGVs. "Wait no longer, they arehere," he said.     Ford, Chrysler and General Motors are currently manufacturingdedicated NGVs as part of their overall alternative fuels program.The big three still maintain they are fuel neutral, as they aretesting a number of alternative fuels, Stark said. "But natural gasis rapidly becoming the fuel of choice."     Stark said Chrysler sees itself as the leader in OEM NGVs ratherthan conversion vehicles. Its natural gas vehicle sales nearlytripled this year compared to previous model years, from 445 formodel year 1993 to 1,106 for the early part of 1994. "This 150%increase motivated Chrysler to greatly expand its product line," hesaid.     Chrysler has focused its efforts on the Ram series full-sizevans and passenger- equivalent wagons, also called the B-series CNGvans and wagons. The B-series vans carry up to 14.4 equivalentgallons of CNG and get up to 216 miles between fill- ups. Stark saidthey were introduced in 1992 and have been continued into 1994.     The Dodge Caravan and Voyager, passenger and cargo CNG minivanswere introduced in 1994. Stark said Chrysler claims its vans use whatis an exclusive natural gas sequential multiport fuel injectionsystem. The CNG vans carry an equivalent of 8.2 gallons of CNG andcan get up to 123 miles between fill-ups. The California AirResources Board certified the CNG minivans as ultra low emissionvehicles, he added.     For model year 1995, a CNG Ram pickup and a CNG Dakota pickupwill be launched sometime in September or October. Chrysler offersfleet purchase incentives of up to $2,000 per vehicle and specialsmall commercial buyer incentives totaling $1,500 per vehicle, hesaid. In addition, the federal government offers a federal income taxdeduction of $2,000 and several utilities, such as Brooklyn Union,offer purchase incentives of up to $1,000 per vehicle, Stark said.     Stark said Ford's NGV program has been in full swing since 1984with its NGV Ranger pickup truck. The company is working on itsEconoline medium- and heavy- duty trucks so they can run on naturalgas. Federal Express has taken some NGV Econoline vans and some P600and F700 medium duty NGV trucks will be going to various fleetsaround the country, Stark said.     Ford's product development program could lead to the first U.S.production of dedicated natural gas passenger sedans, the CNG-poweredCrown Victoria in 1996. For a three-year evaluation period, 50prototypes have been placed in 23 utility fleets.     The Crown Vic has a port-fuel injected 4.6-liter, V-8 engine,and holds an equivalent of 10 gallons of CNG. Stark said Ford plansto use a derivative of the Crown Vic CNG engine in future CNGV-8-powered, F-series pickup and Econoline vans.     The F-series pickup, which will be offered as early as this fallin California, will be a bi-fuel CNG vehicle and hold up to threecylinders, giving it a driving range of 150 miles, he said.      Stark said GM has been striving to be the leader in the NGVsegment. The company has produced more than 2,600 dedicated NGVpickups since 1992, and its 1994 production was to include bi-fuelfull-size pickups, Caprice Classics and Corsica sedans. However,production has been halted for the rest of 1994 due to incidents offuel cylinder ruptures on the earlier pickups. Stark said GM says ithas shown its commitment to be a leader in the alternative fuelvehicle (AFV) market and will be a leader in the AFV and NGV markets.     GM has partnered with Ecotrans, a joint venture between a majorutility and an NGV system manufacturer/vendor. They have teamed up toconvert selected full- size pickups and trucks to dedicated NGVs.This program has been put on hold temporarily.     Japanese car manufacturers, Honda and Mazda, are also developingdedicated NGVs. These prototypes are being tested in Japan, Starksaid.     Construction equipment is also entering the natural gas market.John Deere has developed a prototype CNG-powered backhoe/loader whichincludes 10.3 equivalent gallons of CNG and can operate about fivecontinuous hours between fill-ups. Stark said the prototype may notbe available for two years.     Natural gas is being used in compressors, forklifts, powerengines and other construction equipment, Stark said. Manufacturerssuch as Tecogen, Hercules and Cummins Engine plan to build dedicatedOEM natural gas engines for transportation use. Ingersoll-Rand andGrimmer Schmidt offer CNG compressors, and Clark and Yale offerCNG-powered forklifts, he said.Back to Headline List WT03-B29-2IA059-000320-B038-149http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/bt03.html 205.156.212.5 19970114203433 text/html 83664HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:32:11 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:45:42 GMTContent-length: 83477Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/bt03.html Sample Issue Copyright APPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNet JANUARY 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES BIOPROCESS TECHNOLOGY Antibody Engineering Becomes a Service (179 words) Bayer Looks Into Biocatalytic Synthesis (340 words) Affinity Makes Safer Factor VIII (325 words) Method Purifies Crude Proteins (150 words) GENOMICS Incyte Adds J&J Subscription Database (313 words) INFECTIOUS DISEASE Suppressor Proteins Arrest AIDS Virus (341 words) Vaccine for Peptic Ulcer Is on the Way (250 words) Anti-Staph Antibody Production Expanded (304 words) GENE THERAPY Shering Plough Acquires Canji (132 words) Isis Throws Out Antisense Molecule (156 words) Stem-Cell Therapy Shows Promise (145 words) CANCER Progenics Licenses Melanoma Vaccine (211 words) Alpha Interferon Ok'd for Melanoma (181 words) Urogenital Factor Inhibits Prostate Cancer (203 words) Angiogenesis Blockers Arrest Metastasis (118 words) Researchers Harness Hematopoietic Stem Cells (663 words) Another Gene Defect in Breast Cancer (255 words) CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE Centacor's Results Spell Good News (248 words) GROWTH FACTORS Yet Another Interleukin (166 words) DIAGNOSTICS BioWhittaker Sells Off Diagnostics to Wampole (127 words) Chemtrak Regains Home Cholesterol Test (120 words) Abbott Licenses Thrombosis Test (178 words) Imaging Antibodies Make Progress (669 words) New Outlet for Tumor Marker Test (243 words) NovaDx to Market Arthritis Blood Test (154 words) AGRICULTURE/FOOD Cultor Buys Pfizer's Food Science Group (181 words) More Intense Attack on Fat (610 words) INDUSTRY NEWS Year that Was: The1995 Results (190 words) What's Ahead for 1996?

Other aspects of the engineeringservice will entail improvements of antibody affinity andspecificity for binding to unique antigens often found on thesurface of cells.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Bayer Looks IntoBiocatalytic SynthesisEnzymes are known for their ability to selectively catalyzereactions in both aqueous and non-aqueous media. There is a growinginterest in the biocatalytic synthesis of specialty polymers sincesuch an approach can generate additional properties such aschirality and biodegradability.  Biologically synthesized polymershave been applied as absorbents, biodegradable materials, chiraladsorbents, liquid crystals, and perm-selective membranes.Bayer Corp. (1 Mellon Bank Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15258; Tel:412/394-5500, Fax: 412/394-5534) has discovered a process for theproduction of polyesters reacting a diol with an acid or acid esterin the presence of a solid enzymes and supercritical fluids (U.S.Patent 5,478,910).Low molecular weight linear aliphatic oligoesters that are hydroxyterminated have commercial significance for use in the manufactureof polyurethane resins. The current commercial process is based onacid/base catalyzed condensation polymerization between adiacid/diester and a diol. The use of traditional catalysts islimited because such catalysts tend to have an undesirable effecton the subsequent polyurethane synthesis.Supercritical fluids have been described as extraction solvents,have been used in various industrial extraction processes, and havebeen suggested as being useful for a variety of enzyme catalyzedreactions. With supercritical fluids as the reaction medium, enzymeenantioselectivity can be manipulated by the pressure of thesystem.In both enzymatic and non-enzyme catalyzed synthesis of oligoestersand polyesters, it is difficult to control product molecular weightin a predictable manner. All techniques described to date dependupon changing the reaction time in order to manipulate molecularweight. In the case of non-enzyme catalyzed oligo- and polyesters,the final product typically contains cyclic ester by-products andsmall amounts of residual catalyst, both of which can adverselyaffect properties of products produced from those oligo- andpolyesters.The Bayer innovation overcomes most of the above difficulties andallows for the production of a wide variety of polyesters, where itis relatively simple to produce a material of a desired molecularweight by merely varying the pressure under which thepolyesterification or polytransesterification reaction isconducted.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Affinity MakesSafer Factor VIIIHemophiliacs depend on the clotting substance Factor VIII, but thepossibility of AIDS contaminating the blood supply adds to theirburden. Screening blood donors helps. So does testing for AIDSantibodies, although such tests miss latent virus. Regular FactorVIII is an extract derived from pooled blood. Making sure that theblood used is free of the AIDS virus is of concern to allresponsible manufacturers.Baxter International (Deerfield, Illinois 60015; Tel: 708/948-2000,Fax: 708/948-2887), one of the leading producers of Factor VIIIworldwide, has developed a process for purifying Factor VIII:C byemployment of a multiple immunoaffinity method.  First, FactorVIII:C is pulled out of solution with an immobilized antibody thatspecifically binds this clotting protein through hydrophobicattraction. Next, the protein is eluted from the affinity matrixwith a desorbing, nonpolar solvent.Then, the Factor VIII:C is passed through an affinity region, whichis an ion-exchange region capable of binding the protein whileallowing contaminants to pass through. Finally, the purified factoris eluted from the affinity material and recovered.  The process isdescribed in U.S. Patent 5,470,954.Other approaches to making Factor VIII safer, taken by othersuppliers, include the use of heat or solvent-detergents toinactivate the virus.  The arrival of recombinant Factor VIII,which is produced by cell culture rather than by extraction fromblood, circumvents the whole problem of AIDS contaminationaltogether. The recombinant protein is more expensive than theregular product, however, and some medical insurance companies havebalked at the higher cost.While the cost of treating AIDS would be even greater, shouldpatients come down with this disease, the risk of contracting AIDSfrom regular Factor VIII is very low, the insurers say. The extra-purified, extracted material now becoming available improves thesituation even further and makes it competitive, in terms ofsafety, with the recombinant version. Currently, recombinantproducts have about a 20% share of the total Factor VIII market.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Method PurifiesCrude ProteinsDavid Naveh and John C.

(VanHouten, Industriepark 1, NL-1381 MZ Weesp, The Netherlands; Tel:0031-2940-62424, Fax: 0031-2940-18336) have invented anion-exchange chromatography technique that purifies proteins.  Thecrude protein mixture contains one or more undesirable proteins ofunknown isoelectric points.  Naveh and Tang use either computersimulation or isoelectric focusing gels to determine theisoelectric points of proteins in the crude protein mixture.The pH for the ion-exchange chromatography is adjusted to a pointbetween the ranges of isoelectric points of the protein fractionsto be separated.  Separation occurs when contact is made betweenthe ion-exchange resin and the crude protein mixture.  Since theproteins in the first and second fractions are oppositely charged,only one of the fractions binds to the ion-exchange resin.

Although financial terms were not disclosed, thearrangment provides for payment of yearly subscription fees and on-site access fees.The addition of J&J brings to Incyte a minimum of $100 million fromall of the subscribers so far, which also include Abbott, Hoechst,Novo Nordisk Pfizer, and Pharmacia & Upjohn. Notes Roy Whitfield,president and CEO of Incyte, "The recent increase in the number ofLifeseq subscribers is indicative of the growing realization thatthe use of genomic sequence and expression information representsan essential tool in pharmaceutical and new diagnostic productdevelopment."Incyte's database contains a wealth of genomic sequence and tissue-specific expression information, encompassing 800,000 cDNA clonesto date.  The genetic data are obtained from over 800 tissuesamples in its in-house bank, a figure which is expanding. Incytebelieves it has the largest sequencing and bioinformatics operationin the world, with an ability to screen as many as 4,000 partialgenes each day.Subscribers to the  database use the genetic information toidentify new therapeutic targets for drug development, identifyhuman analogs of promising animal molecules, learn more aboutparticular disease processes, and understand the pharmacologicaland toxicological impact of a new drug on human tissues.Diagnostic applications are other uses of the genetic information.Tissue-specific cDNA refers to the genes actually turned on, andturned on uniquely, in the various bodily tissues.  While everyhuman cell possess the full set of genes (now thought to numberaround 70,000), the process of differentiation during embryodevelopment results in the turning on and turning off of particulargenes in a way that gives each tissue its special characteristics.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Suppressor ProteinsArrest AIDS VirusResearchers at the University of Maryland have identified a newfamily of proteins that may slow the progression of AIDS in peoplewho have been infected with the virus for a period of time but whohave not become sick.At the University of Maryland, where Robert Gallo led the researcheffort, scientists identified three closely related suppressorproteins and isolated them from human immune cells.  When mixed ina test tube with the AIDS virus, the three proteins worked inconcert to stop the virus from multiplying.  The proteins have thenames rantes, mip1-alpha, and mip1-beta.At another research institute, Germany's Paul Ehrlich Institute(Langen, Germany), scientists discovered a fourth suppressorprotein. It appears to be unrelated to the other three.  Thisprotein is equated with a previously known substance, interleukin-16.In test tubes, the proteins prevent the AIDS virus fromreproducing.  Scientists say they believe that patients with slowlyprogressing AIDS may have higher levels of these HIV suppressors intheir bloodstreams than patients who get sick relatively quickly.The discoveries are likely to increase research competition for newtreatments that can be based on these suppressor proteins.  AnthonyFauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDiseases, believes that the discoveries open new avenues of drugresearch. But the research teams themselves say they do not yetknow how the suppressor proteins work, nor have they been able toprove that the proteins delay the onset of full-blown AIDS in somepatients.These recent discoveries come from nearly 10 years of research inwhich scientists have noticed that human immune system cells,called CD-8+,  apparently elaborate proteins that seem to stop theAIDS virus from replicating.  At the earlier time, they were notable to identify the molecular structure of the proteins.The Gallo team at Maryland has been making progress towardunderstanding how the suppressor proteins might work and expects tobegin animal tests that can determine whether therapies based onthe newly discovered suppressor proteins are possible.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Vaccine for PepticUlcer Is on the WayThe joint venture between OraVax (Cambridge, MA; Tel: 617/494-1339)and Pasteur-Merieux-Connaught announced the successful completionof a Phase I clinical trial with their UreAB vaccine antigenagainst Helicobacter pylori, the causative bacterial infectionunderlying most cases of peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis.In the U.S. alone, this infection affects 20% of the populationbetween ages 20 and 30 and more than 50% of the population belowage 60.  The infection causes the large fraction of the more than5 million cases of peptic ulcers seen each year in the U.S. InJapan, where the problem is even worse, the infection rate exceeds80%.Peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis currently are treated by twoprincipal classes of drugs that prevent gastric acid secretion, H2receptor blockers and ATPase/proton pump inhibitors. H2 receptorblockers include SmithKline Beecham's cimetidine (Tagamet), Merck'sfamotidine (Pepcid), Lilly's nizatidine (Axid), and Glaxo'sranitidine (Zantac) and have combined worldwide annual salestotaling about $6 billion.ATPase/proton pump inhibitors include the omeprazole sold by Merck(Prilosec), Astra (Losec), and Takeda's lansoprazole (Takepron) andhave combined worldwide annual sales of about $1.5 billion.  Havingsubstantially  fewer sales are prostaglandin mimics, such asSearle's Cytotec. The market additionally includes such OTCproducts as Tums and Maalox.If peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis can be prevented with avaccine, doing so will probably cut deeply into the sales of allthese different products -- good for the national healthcare billbut bad for the suppliers of treatment drugs.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Anti-Staph AntibodyProduction ExpandedNorth American Biologicals Inc.

In the United States,approximately 3 million people run the risk of developing Staphinfections in hospitals.The data gathered in this study will be used to assist NABI inproducing clinical trial quantities of StaphGAM, which is expectedto begin human Phase I trials in late 1996.The company has presented preclinical data that indicated thatStaphGAM reduced the occurrence in animal models of S. aureusendocarditis, an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, byup to 80%. According to company officials, in several animalchallenge models StaphGAM also significantly reduced the number ofStaph bacteria surviving in the blood, livers, and kidneys afterexperimental infection.The donor stimulation program currently under way is intended tomaximize antibody production in donors by evaluating the impact ofdifferent dosing regimes and differing antibody collectionschedules. Once NABI has determined that StaphGAM is stimulatingthe optimum levels of Staph-fighting antibodies in donors, thecompany plans to expand the number of donors being immunized andbegin producing trial quantities of StaphGAM in mid-1996.NABI's donor stimulation program for StaphGAM, which was initiatedin September 1995, comprises 70 healthy adults who are vaccinatedwith StaphVAX, the staph vaccine that NABI has licensed from theNational Institutes of Health (NIH), to stimulate the production ofhigh levels of antibodies against staph in plasma donors.These antibodies are then purified and formulated into a specificpolyclonal antibody product, called StaphGAM.  StaphGAM may provideimmediate protection to patients who are at risk of contractinghospital-related staph infections.

Called GMK, the vaccine consists of a gangliosideconjugate, one of a new class being developed by the company.Gangliosides are complexes of carbohydrates and lipids found on thesurface of cells.  In particular, GM2 ganglioside is present inapproximately 95% of melanoma cells.  The company has conjugatedthis ganglioside to the hemocyanin of the keyhole limpet, whichserves as a protein carrier of the substance.In clinical trials, patients vaccinated with this conjugate, calledGMK, developed anti-GM2 antibodies that were capable ofspecifically killing melanoma cells. Melanoma is the most deadlytype of skin cancer and is growing at the fastest rate of anycancer in the industrialized world.  In the U.S. alone, about37,000 new melanoma cases were reported in 1994, and by 2000 it isestimated that 1 in 90 Americans will develop this disease.Two large Phase III clinical trials of Progenics' GMK vaccine areto start in early 1996 and will involve high-risk patients in theU.S. and Europe.

The drug is intended to curbrelapses of the cancer.A recent clinical study showed that the alpha-interferon increasedthe median overall survival of patients by more than 12 months andthe median relapse-free survival by nine months. The five-yearsurvival rate was improved by 24%, and the five-year relapse-freerate by 42%.

The research on ps20 isbeing done by David Rowley, in the Department of Cell Biology, whohas now produced a recombinant version.Rowley previously isolated UGIF from cells of the rat fetalurogenital sinus organ. This substance was shown to inhibit DNAsynthesis and cell proliferation of human prostatic carcinomacells.  The researchers speculate that a reduction in UGIF leads topoorly differentiated cells associated with the progression ofprostatic carcinomas, while an adequate presence of UGIF promotesdifferentiation and thereby inhibits growth. If UGIF activity canbe enhanced (for example, through the action of ps20), then thetypical progression of cancer cells may be inhibited. A U.S. patenthas been issued on the use of UGIF for the treatment of prostatecancer.Sheffield Medical Technologies (1111 Bagby, Houston, TX 77002; Tel:713/739-8221, Fax: 713/739-1131) holds an option to exclusivelylicense both the ps20 and the UGIF technology.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Angiogenesis BlockersArrest MetastasisBristol-Myers Squibb (Princeton, NJ 08543-4000; Tel: 609/252-4000,Fax: 609/252-3885) thinks EntreMed (Rockville, MD; Tel. 301/217-9858) is on to something, and is exclusively licensing thecompany's antiangiogenesis compounds that, in preclinical studies,prevent the abnormal formation of blood vessels and thereby blockthe growth of primary and metastatic cancers.

Physicians want touse high-dose chemical or radiation treatment, but the untowardside effect is a destruction of bone-marrow cells and consequentlya severe depletion in the number of infection-fighting white bloodcells and clot-promoting platelets. To find any use of the bettercancer-fighting effect of high-dose treatment, this problem has tobe surmounted.Cell Genesys (344 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, CA 94404; Tel:415/358-9600, Fax: 415/358-0803) seeks to use stem cells for cancergene therapy. Cell Genesis genetically engineered the stem cells sothat they recognize a specific protein on the surface of tumorcells, then transplanted them into mice.  Over 80% of the micereceiving a lethal injection of malignant tumor cells survived atleast 17 weeks and showed no evidence of residual tumor when testedby a highly sensitive PCR assay for tumor-specific DNA.Increasing the number of stem cells as an adjunct to high-dosecancer treatment helps patients resist the sometimes fatalinfections that may develop as a serious side effect.  The stemcells can be increased either in the body or outside it.Aastrom Biosciences (24 Frank Wright Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48106;Tel: 313/930-5555), a collaborator of RPR Gencell, takes theapproach of increasing stem cells outside the body.  In a clinicaltrial at the University of Texas's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, thefeasibility and safety of an ex vivo method of stem-cell productionwas demonstrated as an adjunct to autologous bone-marrowtransplantation, itself given as an adjunct to cancer therapy.Stem cells from 10 breast-cancer patients were collected,individually cultivated in the company's automated cell-productionsystem, then returned to the patients.Taking a similar approach is Systemix (3155 Porter Drive, PaloAlto, CA 94304; Tel: 415/856-4901).  The difference is that thecompany isolates a specific variant of stem cells, theCD34+Thy+Lin- type. A Phase I/II clinical test with multiplemyeloma patients showed that the infusion of these cells appearedto help the patients.Stem cells, and their progeny, can also be mobilized within thebody.  That's the way Immunex (51 University St., Seattle,Washington 98101; Tel: 206/587-0430, Fax: 206/587-0606) sees it.The company has just obtained FDA approval to use its Leukine brandof GM-CSF (generically called sargramostim) as a growth factor tostimulate peripheral blood progenitor cells and for use aftertransplantation of such cells. The drug is administered to patientsbefore collecting peripheral blood and isolating the progenitorcells by apheresis.  The procedure cuts down the number ofapheresis runs that must be carried out.  Peripheral progenitorcells are reinfused into patients after their high-dose cancertherapy.Rivals to Immunex and competing against each another, Amgen (1840DeHavilland Drive, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320-1789; Tel: 805/447-1000)and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (500 Arcola Road, Collegeville, PA 19426;Tel: 610/454-8000, Fax: 610/454-3813) use a different growthfactor, G-CSF, on peripheral blood cells. Amgen's product, Neupogen(generically known as filgrastim) has obtained approval for thisapplication, the fourth indication of the drug. RPR, still inclinical trials, says its version of G-CSF, generically calledlenograstim, may be more potent than Amgen's product.Amgen points out that in the U.S. alone, about 17,000 celltransplants were performed in 1994, of which 9,000 were peripheralblood progenitor-cell transplants, representing a 30%-35% increasein the number of such procedures over the previous year.  Thisincrease results from both an increase in the number of patientseligible for treatment and a 50% conversion from bone-marrowtransplants.The latter are not only more invasive and therefore more risky thanperipheral blood transplants, but also more costly in dollar terms.The main cost advantage with peripheral blood-transplantationmethods is that patients can recover outside the hospital after theblood cells have been collected.  Also, hospital stays after thetransplantation are shorter, which saves money as well.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Another Gene Defectin Breast CancerAn international team of scientists, which includes a researchgroup at Duke Medical Center (Durham, NC) led by P. Andrew Futrealand the Institute of Cancer Research (Surrey, U.K.) led by Dr.Michael Stratton, has identified a second major breast-cancer genethat makes some women highly likely to get the disease.  Thirty-eight others from six countries were involved in the researcheffort.The gene is called BRCA2, and it follows the identification ofBRCA1 last year.  Together, the genes account for about 90% ofbreast cancers from inherited susceptibility, with BRCA2responsible for about 40%. It has earlier been announced thatscientists had narrowed the search for BRCA2 to a small area ofchromosome 13.In a related development, scientists at Myriad Genetics Inc. (SaltLake City, UT) announced that they had recovered the entire BRCA2gene.  The company says it plans to use it in combination withBRCA1 to develop a test for predisposition to hereditary breastcancer.Only about 5-10% of breast cancer cases are now thought to comefrom inheriting a faulty gene.  The cause of the vast majority ofcases of breast cancer is not known, although scientists areinvestigating possible hormonal and other triggers.Like BRCA1, the new-found gene seems to suppress cancer when it isworking normally.  But when BRCA2 is defective, this brake is lost.In the short term, location of the second gene should lead to moretests to help families with high rates of breast cancer  learnwhich members are affected.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Centacor's ResultsSpell Good NewsCentocor (200 Great Valley Pkwy., Malvern, PA 19355-1307; Tel:610/651-6000) called an early halt of its clinical study of ReoProbecause the drug has proven so effective in treating patients withunstable angina. The study was scheduled to run until late 1996 orearly 1997, but early results showed that patients who were givenReoPro intravenously had a nearly 70% reduction in deaths.Angina is a disorder in which narrowing of arteries diminishesblood supply to the heart. The clinical trial that was haltedinvolved patients who were given coronary angioplasty to open theclot-clogged arteries. ReoPro prevents platelet cells in the bloodfrom sticking together and initiating clot formation in arteries,which in this instance helps prevent the artery from re-closing dueto a new formation of blood clots.ReoPro costs $1,350 per treatment, but Centocor's earlier studiesfound that it saves $3,000 per patient in overall medical carecosts by preventing complications.  Patients receive one course oftreatment per angioplasty.In 1995, ReoPro produced revenues of about $22 million (the productis licensed to Eli Lilly, who pays Centocor a percentage in royaltyincome)  This year it is estimated that the revenues should jump to$100 million, and by the year 2000, it is estimated that  revenuescould be $782 million.

Thecytokine stimulates the growth of CD4+ T cells, the very onesinfected by HIV/AIDS. Besides binding to the CD4 receptor andstimulating T-cell growth, IL-16 also stimulates the migration oflymphocytes, eosinophils, and monocytes.  Expression of IL-16 isthought to be an early response to histamine, a messenger hormoneof the immune system.The scientists have characterized the gene that codes for IL-16 andhave produced a recombinant product in both prokaryotic andeukaryotic expression systems. Not only might IL-16 itself havepotential use as an AIDS-fighting material; antagonists to IL-16could also relieve the bronchial constriction characteristic ofasthma or could treat T-cell lymphoma by blocking IL-16's bindingto the CD4 receptor.

The test is to serve as an early warning of impending heartattack and other cardiovascular disorders.According to the president of American Biogenetic Sciences, "TheTpP test holds the potential of fundamentally changing themanagement of patients entering emergency rooms with chest pains orother possible heart attack symptoms." Studies indicate the thetest can provide an early detection of artery-clogging blood clots,while current tests rely on the detection of proteins released fromalready-dying heart muscle.The American Heart Association reports that nearly 59 millionpersons in the U.S. have some form of cardiovascular disease. Justin the past year, $137.7 billion has been spent on treating acuteand chronic cardiovascular problems. Due to the rising number ofolder people expected in the future as the "baby boomers"  age, thecosts are projected to double in the next eight years.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Imaging AntibodiesMake ProgressOn Oct. 17, 1995, an FDA advisory-panel meeting deferred a decisionregarding the approval of CEA-Scan, from Immunomedics Inc. (300American Road, Morris Plains, NJ 07950; Tel: 201/605-8200, Fax:201/605-8282), to another FDA panel comprised of specialists indiagnostic imaging and oncology. Immunomedics now responds byfinalizing its presentation to this new panel.  It believes it hasmade progress toward agreements on all issues raised by the FDA.CEA-Scan is in the final stages of regulatory review in the U.S.and Europe.  The company is also planning to commence clinicaltrials and to seek regulatory approval of this product in Japan. Incontrast to other countries, Japan requires that the pivotalclinical trials be conducted in Japan.  Therefore, the companycannot submit its final clinical data from U.S. studies.CEA-Scan should be able to image cancers other than colorectal,such as esophagal, medullary thyroid, breast, lung, stomach, bileduct, pancreatic, ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancers. Togetherthese comprise more than 600,000 new cancer cases in the U.S. on anannual basis.  The two most prevalent are lung and breast cancers,and it is for that reason that Immunomedics is pursuing additionaluses of CEA-Scan by undertaking pivotal trials in these cancertypes. The lung-cancer pivotal trial is going on, and the protocolfor the breast-cancer trial is being designed for submission to theFDA.Since there are other new methods being developed to better assessthe malignancy or spread of a tumor found on mammography, thecompany has taken more time than originally planned to study thepotential of CEA-Scan in this disease. The company already knowsfrom its Phase II clinical results that CEA-Scan can becomplimentary to mammography for diagnosing a breast tumor.Further, it can reveal involvement of the axilla, which isprognostically important when doing a presurgical evaluation.A single injection of CEA-Scan can also reveal spread of cancer toother parts of the body, which otherwise requires a battery ofimaging tests, such as CAT scans, bone scans, and the like.The company believes there are opportunities for the use of CEA-Scan in breast cancer, which affects approximately one in ninewomen in the U.S. with an annual mortality of about 46,000.  PhaseIII trials must be performed before Immunomedics can be sure of theefficacy of CEA-Scan for breast-cancer detection.Other Immunomedics products are progressing well in regulatoryreviews around the world.  LeukoScan, for imaging and diagnosingsites of infection and inflammation, is progressing well inregulatory review in Europe, where it was filed in August 1995 forthe detection of sites of infection in the extremities,particularly osteomyelitis. The company anticipates an inspectionof its manufacturing facilities by the European regulatoryrepresentatives during January of this year. Because of all of thisregulatory activity for CEA-Scan in the U.S. and Europe, and forLeukoScan in Europe, the company has delayed the filing ofLeukoScan in the U.S.The pivotal trial for the appendicitis indication for LeukoScan hasbeen progressing well, and the company is already halfway throughthe planned patient accrual.  Patient enrollment for the prostheticjoint infection or inflammation protocol has been much slower thanoriginally projected.Other uses of LeukoScan are being considered for additional trials.Therefore, at least one other application for this product willbegin clinical studies during 1996.Other Immunomedics imaging products, LymphoScan and AFP-Scan, areprogressing well in clinical trials.  As Orphan Drug products,these have a more limited clinical application and have thereforebeen moving slower through clinical trials.With substantial input from the FDA and the oncological community,a Phase III pivotal trial protocol for LymphoScan, as an imagingagent for staging non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, is still being designedby the company.Because of the rarity of the diseases in the U.S. for which thecompany's AFP-Scan is designed -- for diagnosing cancers of thetestes, ovary, and liver -- it has been necessary for the companyto seek clinical testing sites abroad.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996New Outlet forTumor Marker TestAMDL Inc.

"If it tastes good, it must befattening" seems to be the common plaint. Without self-control andmaking changes in food choices, individuals may turn to diet aids,such as amphetamine-based appetite suppressants.   Researchers arenow taking a new approach, based on a growing understanding of howthe body regulates fat storage and the sensation of satiety -- thefeeling that you've eaten enough. The research offers new targetsfor drug development in this field.The finding by Jeffrey Friedman, Rockefeller University, of an OB("obesity) gene, its licensing to Amgen (1840 De Havilland Drive,Thousand Oaks, CA 91320; Tel: 805/447-2303), and its recombinantexpression by scientists at Hoffmann-La Roche (340 Kingsland St.,Nutley, NJ 07110-1199; Tel: 201/562-2232) were reported in AGN(August).The protein specified by the OB gene is called leptin, a peptidehormone that, when injected into a mouse brain, results in reducedfood intake and a reduction in body weight among specially made,obese mice. Leptin (fron the Greek, meaning "thin") appears to acton neural pathways that control eating, energy metabolism, and bodyweight. As fat builds up, fat cells release leptin to curb theappetite and make the body use up excess fat.The news continues with two further developments. MilleniumPharmaceuticals (640 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA 02139-4815; Tel:617/374-9480) has identified, cloned, and isolated the brain'sreceptor for leptin, called OB-R. This gene in mice sits on a partof chromosome 4 known to contain the so-called "db" gene, whichalso plays a role in obesity, although it is not yet firmly proventhat  the OB-R gene and the db gene are one and the same.The finding of the leptin receptor is significant. Although leptinmay have a future as a weight-controlling drug (and Amgen certainlythinks so),  initial human studies last year have shown that mostobese persons are not deficient in leptin but, in fact, haveelevated levels of this fat-suppressive hormone. The fault may lieinstead with a receptor unresponsive to leptin. This seems to bethe case in db-obese mice.Besides the OB-R leptin receptor, Millenium is on the trail ofothers leads relating to the genetic basis for obesity.  Last year,its scientists found another obesity-connected gene in mice, calledthe "tub" gene. The company's research on obesity (and on diabetes)is being financially supported by Hoffmann-La Roche.Even more recently, Stephen Bloom at the Royal Postgraduate MedicalSchool of Hammersmith Hospital (London, U.K.) reports newinformation about an intestinal protein called glucogen-likepeptide-1 (GLP-1).  After a meal, the intestines secrete GLP-1,which then signals the pancreas to start producing insulin.Insulin is the hormone that prompts body cells to take in dietaryglucose from the bloodstream and start using it. Bloom now findsthat GLP-1 also tells the brain that enough food has been consumed,in other words, gives the sensation of satiety.   Thus, the GLP-1is a natural appetite suppressant.It now seems clear that the biological regulation of appetite, bodymass, and metabolism is complex and interrelated.  Undoubtedly,more targets for potential therapeutic intervention will berevealed in the future.  What, for instance, comprises the body'sthreshhold for sensing "excessive" fat?  What drives theindividual, mechanistically and biochemically, to seek out food?Why (and how) do certain foods appeal and others do not?  Can thebody's channeling of metabolism toward muscle or fat distributionbe influenced? Until more answers come in and the new drugs arrive,it looks like we'll just have to continue our efforts to resistthat second helping.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Year that Was:The1995 ResultsCompanies are reporting their 1995 financial results, and so far,the performances don't look great.

We're reminded of theConey Island fortune teller who predicted we'd soon take a journeyover water.  The next day it rained and in the course of ourperigrinations we stepped over a puddle, fulfilling the prophecy.Predicting this year's unfolding of biotechnology events issomething like that Coney Island experience: If they're generalenough, predictions surely will come to pass, like saying somebiotechnology companies in 1996 will probably succeed while otherswill probably have to pack it in. Some products in clinical trialswill pass, while others will fail.Ah, but which ones?  If that could be known ahead of time, onecould make a fortune.  Some people, of course, believe that test-tube experiments and preclinical studies with animal models canforetell the future -- how the candidate drugs will behave inhumans. And a lot of bets are placed on such forecasts.  One of thebig events of the year just past is the recognition that somebiotechnology efforts may fail, just as surely as some willsucceed. We may not know precisely which category any particularventure may fall into, but just the mere recognition that failuremay occur represents a far cry from biotechnology's earlier, headydays of overconfidence. Building in plans for the unexpected"impossibilities" provides companies with mechanisms in place tolet them cope with uncertainty and survive.Forecasting is not all speculation, of course, although it can bewishful thinking.  If a product passes its trials, and if  itreceives regulatory approval, and if  it captures an assumedpercentage share of its available market, then a reasonableforecast of its possible sales can be made and the manufacturingcapacity to fulfill that demand can be rationally planned.  The"trick" lies in being as objective (at least with oneself) inmaking business forecasts as in designing laboratory experiments.Some forecasting is done by extrapolating from the past andpresent, in light of unfolding forces for change. On this basis,predicting biotechnology events in 1996 is made a little easier byconsidering several discernible trends.Virtualization of the pharmaceutical industry will accelerate.  Bigpharma surrounds itself with drug-discovery firms to fulfill itsresearch needs, while biotechnology companies surround themselveswith contract manufacturers. It's cheaper and less committal thanhiring in these functions. Marketing may become the next functionto be outsourced.Differentation of the biotechnology industry will become moretransparent. Companies divide into those seeking to commercializebiomolecules and those seeking to commercialize chemical moleculesacting on biological targets. They also divide into discoverers ofcandidate targets for therapeutic intervention and developers ofactual drug candidates.The struggle to survive will become more intense. It getting harderto raise money to sustain research in view of coming cuts in thefederal budget. Biotechnology companies will increasingly be judgedon their ability to actually deliver products for sale.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996M&A Picks Upin Health CareAccording to investment firm Hambrechst & Quist (1 Bush St., SanFrancisco, CA 94104; tel. 415/576-3300), merger and acquisitionactivity in health care services will continue to accelerate in1996, particularly among home care, physician practice managementand HMOs. "Health care reform has driven the health servicesindustry toward consolidation," James Streator, managing directorof Hambrecht & Quist's health services group, observes. "Many ofthe markets targeted by service companies are either fragmented orundergoing significant consolidation."In 1995, 82 mergers and acquisitions took place among health careservices companies, representin galmost $14 billion in transactionvalue.  These figures compare with 69 such deals worth $20.7billion in 1994 and 61 deals valued at $16.5 billion in 1993.Streator adds that "Continued focus on cost containment and qualitystandards will characterize health care services in 1996."Financing activity is also anticipated to increase in 1996,particularly in information services and physician management. In1995, 41 equity offerings were made in the health services sector,both initial and follow-on, raising a total of $3.5 billion. Thiscompares with 39 offerings in 1994 for $1.8 billion and 33offerings in 1993 for $1.4 billion.AGN notes that consolidation in the health services sectortranslates into fewer but more powerful customers for products thatthe biotechnology industry, pharmaceutical industry and medicaldevice industry have for sale.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Biogen's b-IFNCloser to MarketBiogen Inc. (14 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142; Tel:617/679-2000, Fax: 617/679-2617) announced that a Central NervousSystem Advisory Committee convened by the FDA has recommended thatthe FDA approve Biogen's Avonex interferon-beta-la, for treatmentof relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).Biogen officials believe Avonex represents a major improvement inthe treatment of MS because it is the first and only drug to show,in a blinded clinical trial, that it slows the progression ofdisability and reduces the frequency of exacerbations. The FDAAdvisory Committee recommendation was based on data from a PhaseIII clinical trial, in which 40% fewer patients on Avonexprogressed one or more units on the Expanded Disability StatusScale (EDSS) than patents on placebo. The EDSS is the standardmeasure of disease progression in MS.In addition, patients receiving Avonex in the trial experienced 32%fewer exacerbations of the disease than patients on placebo.Further studies, using gadolium-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI), showed a statistically significant reduction in the numberand volume of active lesions in treated patients compared toplacebo patients.Side effects seen in the trial were modest and largely involvedflu-like symptoms characteristic of all interferon drugs.  Therewere minimal injection-site reactions.Biogen, based on the findings of the Advisory Committee, isoptimistic that it will be proceeding to commercialization soonafter the final inspection of its manufacturing facilities by theFDA.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Perkin-Elmer FormsHuman Genome CRADAPerkin-Elmer's (761 Main Ave., Norwalk, CT  06859;  Tel: 203/762-1000,  Fax: 203/762-6000) Applied Biosystems Division todayannounced the formation of a Cooperative Research And DevelopmentAgreement (CRADA) with the National Center for Human GenomeResearch (NCHGR) to  increase the speed of large-scale genotypingto identify complex  human genetic diseases.Under the terms of the CRADA, Perkin-Elmer will supply the NCHGRwith Applied Biosystems Genetic Analysis Systems to enhance NCHGR'scurrent gene-discovery effort aimed at finding the geneticcomponent  of late-onset diabetes and prostate cancer.

Repligen hopes the rPF-4ultimately will serve as an alternative to protamine, whichcurrently has use for reversing heparin's effects.  Protamine nowis used to neutralize heparin after all 500,000 open heartsurgeries done annually in the U.S. and in a portion of the U.S.'s900,000 diagnostic cardiac catheterizations.Heparin itself is an inhibitor of the clot-promoting enzyme,thrombin.  While it is needed to keep blood flowing duringcardiosurgical procedures, the problem with heparin is that it maycause capillary bleeding after close-up if it remains active.

The new company will also market and receive royaltiesfrom sales of Seragen products in Canada for the applicationsSeragen has retained under its prior agreements with Eli Lilly,Seragen's partner for the development of fusion toxins havingcancer applications.The Canadian affiliate will bear a portion of the costs ofSeragen's clinical trials for HIV and psoriasis, thereby relievingSeragen of up to C$5.3 million of costs, which Seragen wouldotherwise have incurred. Seragen Biopharmaceuticals could alsoreceive significant tax rebates on qualifying R&D -- on the orderof $2 million to $3 million over the next several years.Initial plans call for expanding to several Canadian sites thePhase III clinical trials regarding an application to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The IND application was recently approved byCanada's Health Protection Branch, and one Canadian site in Torontohas already been initiated.The company also plans to conduct a Phase II trial involving an HIVapplication  and possibly part of a Phase III trial in a psoriasisapplication.Seragen's fusion toxins link the diphtheria toxin to a hormone orgrowth factor that targets  a specific receptor on the surface ofdisease-causing cells.  The diphtheria toxin is one of the mostpotent poisons in nature, possessing cytotoxic activity thatenables it to destroy targeted cells by shutting down proteinbiosynthesis, in this case being harnessing to destroy diseasedcells. In its natural state, the diphtheria toxin rides along on a"universal" targeting material, but in Seragen's products the toxinis made to selectively destroy only the specifically targetedcells.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Synapic IPO FundsReceptor SearchSynaptic Pharmaceutical Corp.

(777 Old Saw Mill River Road, Tarrytown,NY 10591-64705; Tel: 914/345-3344, Fax: 914/345-3565) formed in1992 to discover drugs for inflammation and immunologicaldisorders, but its collaborations with other companies extends itsreach into other therapeutic areas, including cardiovasculardisease, CNS disorders, endocrine and metabolic diseases, andcancer.The company's president and CEO is Dr. Jeremy Levin, who is both aPh.D. and an M.D.  Levin previously was vice president of corporatedevelopment at Integrated Genetics (now part of Genzyme) and beforethat, was the founder of Odyssey Biomedical.The technological focus of Cadus lies in signal-transductionpathways and their use as screening tools for the discovery ofcompounds that may serve as drugs. A signal-transduction pathwayis the mechanism by which cells respond to messenger chemicals fromthe "outside world." Messenger chemicals such as hormones andgrowth factors impinge on the outer surface of cells, landing onreceptor substances that accomodate the size, shape, and chemicalbinding ability of the messengers.This binding of messenger chemical to cell receptor ultimatelytriggers an action by the cell, perhaps to commence multiplying,perhaps to commence secreting a substance.  The mechanism by whichthe initial messenger-receptor interaction is transmitted asinformation to the innards of the cell is what is meant by thesignal-transduction pathway.  It is a relay system, in whichpeptides at the inner surface may join up to form larger, andbiologically active proteins; in which phosphorylating enzymesbecome activated and commence to phosphorylate and thereby activatethe next enzyme in the series; and in which other subtle molecularand biochemical events proceed.One of the most common types of signal-transduction pathways is theG-protein coupled type; more than 1,000 such receptors having beenidentified to date. G-protein receptors, for instance, underlie theactions of such hormones as adrenaline, angiotensin, glucagon,luteinizing hormone, and vasopressin, and such neurotransmitters asacetylcholine, enkephalin, and endorphin.Such receptors also mediate odorants in the neuroepithelial cellsof the nose and light striking  the rod and cone cells comprisingthe retina of the eye. They apparently play a role in Alzheimer'sdisease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, atherosclerosis, andsome cancers.Binding of the initial messenger to the receptor causes a change inthe structure of the G protein, which in turn has the effect ofactivating an associated enzyme, such as adenylyl cyclase, cyclicguanosine monophosphate cyclase orphospholipase C.  The action ofthe enzyme generates a second messenger substance, this timeoperating inside the cell, that through one or more steps resultsin the cell's ultimate behavior.Cadus's key accomplishment is the construction of intact human G-protein signal transduction material in yeast through geneticengineering. These yeast constructs are usable as screening toolsto identify compounds that affect the biological activity of aspecific target within the signaling pathway. Another of the firm'splatform technologies looks at compounds interacting with othersignal transduction targets, such as tyrosine/MAP/MEK kinases,multisubunit immune recognition receptors and G-protein coupledreceptors.An offshoot that Cadus has developed is yeast-screening technologycapable of identifying functional ligands for orphan receptors.  Sofar, only about 10% of the human receptors have known functions.The other 90% are orphans -- nobody knowns what they do. Cadus hasconstructed genetically engineered yeast cells expressing orphanreceptors, which and can be used as screening tools.Among many challenge peptides inserted into the yeast, binding ofthe right one to the orphan receptor will allow the yeast  cell togrow.  This agonistic peptide can then be recovered and identifiedfor further studies. One critical look is to see what effect thispeptide has on human cells, and thereby to ascertain whether theassociated orphan receptor merits attention for drug-developmentefforts.Bristol-Myers Squibb endorses Cadus's work through its continuingfinancial support.  BMS provided its initial support in July 1994and added an additional $5 million equity investment in November1995.  Ultimately, Cadus could receive more than $45 million fromBMS under all the terms of the agreement. Solvay Duphar (Brussels,Belgium) is another supporter, one that in November 1995 gave Cadus$10 million in a deal ultimately worth perhaps up to $50 million.The latest news is that Cadus has obtained a patent (U.S. No.5,482,835) protecting its yeast-based, human signal-transductionscreening technology for drug discovery.Apparently, people are beginning to realize that the Human GenomeProject tells only part of the story.  Within the next five to 10years, all the human genes will have been identified and sequenced.But so what? It will still be necessary to identify the rolesplayed by the genes and to ascertain all the interplays among thegenes' proteins. That is what Cadus claims to have a jump on.Back to Headline List CopyrightAPPLIED GENETICS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CALENDARFebruary 8-9, 1996, Southeast Technology Transfer Conference,Orlando, FL.

ARDS is a condition that affects nearly 350,000Americans and is responsible for 170,000 deaths each year.The scientists also presented data showing they were able topredict patients at risk for the illness and that thepredictive value correlated with its severity.ARDS is untreatable and represents the largest cause ofmorbidity and mortality in patients with multiple traumaticinjuries. The condition is a form of lung damage often foundin patients whose lungs are injured by the systemicinflammatory response following traumatic injury, severe bloodinfections such as sepsis, or other systemic illness. Anothersubset of patients at extreme risk for ARDS includes cancerpatients receiving high-dose radiation therapy orchemotherapy."Based on the results of our pilot studies and the breadth ofour pre-clinical data, lisofylline may increase the efficacyand reduce the cost of trauma care by significantly shorteningthe length of hospital stay and recuperation time," saidJames A. Bianco, M.D., president and chief executive officerof Cell Therapeutics, Inc.The company's researchers have previously reported a linkbetween the production of phosphatidic acid (PA) and theoxidative damage to lung and other organs seen in ARDS. PA isa fat-like chemical messenger generated by the cell membranein response to cell injury caused by a form of highly reactiveoxygen. They hypothesized that since lisofylline inhibits PAformation, the small-molecule drug would decrease cellsusceptibility to oxidative damage and reduce the lung leakobserved in ARDS patients.In a pilot study, Stuart L. Bursten, M.D., Ph.D., principalscientist at Cell Therapeutics, Inc., and co-workers measuredthe ratio of certain free fatty acids (FFA) - chemicalby-products of PA metabolism - found in the blood. They foundthat the increase in the ratio of the fatty acids predictedwhich patients would develop the syndrome and that thepredictive value correlated with the severity of the illness.FFA levels in serum of 39 healthy control subjects weremeasured and retrospectively compared to the FFA serum levelsin 30 patients who had developed sepsis, trauma or ARDS within24 hours of serum sampling. Of these 30 patients, 13 were atrisk for ARDS but did not develop the syndrome, seven patientsat risk for ARDS did develop the condition, and 10 patientshad ARDS on admission to the study.The serum samples from all 30 ARDS patients had significantlyelevated ratios of specific serum FFA (i.e., oleate pluslineolate : palmitate) compared to healthy control subjects(p < 0.01).The researchers then conducted a 13-patient, randomizedplacebo-controlled pilot study of lisofylline in patients withlife-threatening infections and multiple organ failure whowere at risk for ARDS. None of the six patients who receivedlisofylline died, while three out of seven patients inthe non-treatment group did. In addition, the FFA (acyl chain)ratio for the lisofylline-treated patients was significantlylower than the placebo control group (1.21 and 1.46respectively, p = 0.02)."We found that the calculated ratios of serum free-fattyacids increased and predicted the development of ARDS in theseat-risk patients," said Dr. Bursten. "The data points to theacyl chain ratio as being of clinical utility in predictingARDS and may be a valuable tool in monitoring treatment."Lisofylline is in final stages of Phase II clinical testingof its ability to accelerate blood-cell recovery followingoxidative stress and the cell-membrane damage that occurs fromradiation therapy and chemotherapy. Clinical results haveshown that chemotherapy-treated patients undergoing bone-marrow transplantation and treated with lisofylline experiencea rapid recovery of white blood cells, red blood cells andplatelets.The novel therapeutic also has been shown to protect othertissues and major organs from the otherwise toxic effects of anumber of anticancer agents, including interleukin-2 (IL-2).Cell Therapeutics is in discussions with several potentialcorporate partners to conduct Phase Ill clinical trials oflisofylline for ARDS following multiple trauma.Cell Therapeutics; Inc., is a privately held, Seattle-basedpharmaceutical company developing a new class of drugs thatselectively regulate the metabolism of phosphatidic acid, anabnormal intracellular pathway expressed in cancer, immunediseases and other life-threatening conditions.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECH BUSINESS via NewsNetJanuary 1996MICROCIDE AND DAIICHI FORM PARTNERSHIPTO SOLVE PROBLEM IN ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCEMicrocide Pharmaceuticals, Inc., of Mountain View, CA, andDaiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.  have signed a joint researchagreement to discover and develop drugs that will overcome theefflux pump (drug export) mechanism of resistance used byPseudomonas and other bacteria to thwart the effectiveness ofcurrent antibiotic therapies.Under the three-year agreement, Daiichi will receiveworldwide rights to products emerging from the researcheffort. Initial products of the partnership are expected to beantibiotic-potentiating agents, which would be used togetherwith existing antibiotics. The potentiating agents wouldinterfere with the bacterial drug export system, therebyincreasing drug concentrations within the bacterium to levelssufficient to kill otherwise-resistant organisms. Thecollaboration may also produce agents which are themselvesantibiotics, acting directly to kill bacteria throughinhibition of the efflux mechanism.Microcide will receive research funding of $10 million over 3years and multiple milestone payments for products developedunder the agreement. Microcide will also receive royalties onworldwide sales and has retained co-promotion rights in NorthAmerica for products developed by the partners.Jim Rurka, president and chief executive officer ofMicrocide, said, "Daiichi has a formidable research,development and commercialization track record in theinfectious disease sector, especially with regard to leadingquinolone agents. They are the ideal partner for thisMicrocide technology, because they have acquired unparalleledexpertise on the antibiotic side of the bacterial effluxresistance equation."The companies will each contribute research personnel andcomplementary technologies to the discovery and developmentprogram, with work-plan activities being conducted in bothMountain View and Tokyo. A joint research committee willmanage the collaboration.The efflux pump mechanism has been identified as an importantfactor in the growing problem of bacterial drug resistance.Described as energy-driven and membrane- associated, it worksby pumping antibiotics, including quinolones, out of abacterial cell, reducing the concentration of drug at thetarget site of action. Quinolones are anti-infective compoundsthat inhibit the activity of DNA gyrase, an enzyme necessaryfor bacterial growth. Most fluoroquinolones are readilyabsorbed, making them effective treatments for systemicinfections. The worldwide market for quinolones totalsapproximately $2.5 billion.This collaboration marks the second significant transactionconcluded between Microcide and a major pharmaceutical companyin the past month. On October 25, Microcide announced itsfirst corporate partnership in the form of a multi-yearcollaborative agreement with Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals, adivision of Johnson & Johnson, to develop therapeuticcompounds for Grain-positive bacterial infections.Microcide's corporate strategy calls for similar arrangementsin the future in order to accelerate development of its novelantibiotic discoveries, and to provide a strong financialsupport base for the company.Microcide Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a privately heldbiopharmaceutical company founded to address the emergingmarket by increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance,growth of at-risk populations and decreased research effortsin this arena. The company is focusing on the host-pathogenrelationship and has taken a genetic approach in itstechnology designed to generate novel product leads. Itsinitial chemistry driven efforts are aimed at discovery anddevelopment of new antibiotics for institutionally-acquiredbacterial infections or infections where currently availabletreatments are ineffective or inadequate.Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. is a major Japanese ethicaldrugs maker. The company markets drugs to all bacterialinfections, hepatitis, cancer, thrombosis,hypercholesterolemia and ulcers, and contrast medium.Development efforts center around quinolones, anti-clottingagents, cardiovascular drugs and imaging contrast agents. Thecompany's sales for fiscal 1994 exceeded $2 billion.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECH BUSINESS via NewsNetJanuary 1996CORTECS REPORTS POSITIVE PRELIMINARY RESULTSFOR "PSEUDOSAT" ORAL VACCINE AGAINST PSEUDOMONASCortecs International (NASDAQ:DLVRY/ LSE:COR.UASX:CRI), ofLondon, England, has announced the preliminary results of itsPhase I/II study in bronchiectasis of Pseudostate, its oralvaccine against pseudomonas infection of the lung, which thecompany commenced in March 1995. Analysis of the total resultsis continuing and there should be more to report early in1996.The preliminary analysis shows that, after oral vaccination,these patents exhibited a specific immune response through atype of white blood cell called "T" cells, which enables thesecells to seek out and destroy the invading bacteria.Also in this study, there was observed a several-foldreduction in white cell content of the sputum (white cells insputum reflect the severity of infection, "pus" in sputumpredominantly consists of dead white cells).  Oral Pseudostatwas given at intervals during 56 days and a progressiveimprovement in responses was observed. Within 28 days ofdiscontinuing treatment the white cells in sputum were risingagain.This open phase I/II study was carried out in Newcastle, NSW,Australia at Cortecs' Australian Institute for MucosalImmunology, (AIMI) in 10 patients with bronchiectasis (adisease of the lungs in which the structure of the bronchi,the tubes lining the lungs, is distorted so that bronchialsecretions cannot easily be expelled and then become infectedand very difficult to treat.Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the organism responsible for 90% ofthe deaths in cystic fibrosis patients who usually becomecolonized in early childhood. Antibiotics become lesseffective as lung damage progresses and there are currently novaccines available. These results indicate the viability of anoral vaccine for the prevention of respiratory infection withpseudomonas in patients with serious respiratory diseasessuch as cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis andbronchiectasis.This oral vaccine is being developed for the management ofthese diseases and Phase 11 trials in both cystic fibrosis andchronic bronchitis are scheduled to begin in 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECH BUSINESS via NewsNetJanuary 1996BIOTECHNOLOGY PARTNERS WITH HMO'S TO BOOST BOTTOM LINEBiotechnology companies are increasingly teaming up withmanaged care organizations to help them finance growth,leverage technology, and market products, according to a KPMGPeat Marwick industry guide book, "Blueprint for Growth:Building the Biotechnology Business."Industry restructuring, including new alliances betweenbiotech and managed care companies, is a key finding in the83-page KPMG industry guide book, which creates a profile of acomplex industry in the process of self renewal. Based onsurvey data collected from 374 biotech executives, the guidebook provides a prescription for industry growth. For copiesof the KPMG report, contact Anna Le Goff, KPMG national lifesciences at (800)330-KPMG or via FAX at (609)896-2968.According to the guide book, managed care providers willaccount for 90 percent of the prescription drug customers inthe United States by the turn of the century. Although thislinkage between biotech companies and managed careorganizations has yet to be fully embraced by the industry,some progressive biotechs have joined forces with HMO's.Collaborations make sense for both parties, according toRobert S. Esposito, national director of biotechnology andlife sciences for KPMG Peat Marwick's Health Care & LifeSciences Practice. Biotechnology companies are affected bythe health care environment emphasis on providing care moreefficiently and more cost-effectively; an emphasis that iseven morepronouncedinthemanagedcarearea.Biotechnology companies can fulfill that joint requirement bydeveloping a product that can, for example, eliminate acostly procedure or reduce a hospital stay due to itsefficacy. The challenge is for those companies to buildefficiencies into their product development process that willhelp reduce the burden of their R&D costs on the bottom line.HMO's and other health care payers have access to billions ofinvestment dollars; biotech companies need partners to funddrug development programs. "HMO's combined have in excess $35billion in reserves available for investment," Esposito says,"which is more money in the aggregate than the majorpharmaceutical companies," he points out. Pharmaceuticalcompanies have historically provided biotech inns with animportant source of equity and revenue streams. Some 61percent of the biotech companies responding to a KPMG surveyhave licensed technology to drug companies in exchange forcash and a future royalty stream.This year marked a significant turnaround in the biotechindustry, according to Esposito. "It is the first time thatrevenue units (premiums) are not going to increase fasterthan the rate of inflation. Clearly, biotechnology productshave to be incrementally efficacious; but they're also goingto have to be cheaper," said Esposito.Pharmacoeconomic studies, conducted as early in thedevelopment process as possible, will become more important inbringing drugs to market, Esposito predicts. "If they don'tconduct these studies," Esposito cautions, "companies run therisk of losing out to the competition on what may have been abreakthrough therapy." Esposito adds, "Pharmaceuticals aregoing to be used increasingly in a very different way. Key tothat is pharmacoeconomics. These studies will be critical forHMO's for the next five years or so."Pharmacoeconomic studies are developed with one overridingobjective: cost effectiveness. "Biotech companies have to maketheir drugs compelling and to be ahead of the competition inorder to make a solid pharmacoeconomic argument; not just abetter drug or that it has a higher cure rate. Instead, thecompany must be able to support its product by stating it willsave the system money versus some alternative drugs or no-drugtherapies."Those companies that incorporate pharmacoeconomic studies inpreclinical trials will be positioned substantially better tomeet changing market trends, including increasing competition."Plus," said Esposito, "HMO's will list those drugs on theirformularies. That's a marketing reality."The KPMG survey data report that about 64 percent ofcompanies in clinical trials made an effort to conductpharmacoeconomic studies before they launched their product.The use of such studies is on the rise. The number ofpharmacoeconomic studies per company rose from 1.7 in 1988to 23.7 in 1994, according to the guide book.The publication's other findings describe an industry intransition. They include the following:* The emergence of a new industry structure based on customerfocus in product development. Although nearly 9 in I *executives (89 percent) report that they are focused oncreating breakthrough therapies, a traditional businessstrategy, companies realize that mastering the clinicalapproval process is key to future development.* Steady industry growth, despite recent downsizing. Between1990 and 1993, the average number of employees at a companyrose from 62 to 99. The average amount of space occupied rosefrom 30,150 square feet to 56,661 square feet.* Recruitment and competitive compensation are the two mostchallenging human resource issues. Companies are out-sourcingfunctions such as money management, regulatory affairs, legalcounsel, and facility compliance to remain as lean aspossible.* The year 1994, while one of the dimmest years for equityfinancing, also saw companies focused on raising capital. Some70 percent of survey respondents report that senior managementand business development teams are actively marketing theirtechnologies to investors.

(NASDAQ-IFSC), of New Brunswick,NJ, has announced preliminary results from two phase 2clinical trials utilizing the Company's injectable, natural-source, multispecies alpha interferon ("Natural AlphaInterferon") in patients chronically infected with hepatitisC virus. These results were presented by Dr. D. M. Simon ofAlbert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, andDr. S. C. Gordon of William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak,Michigan, at the annual meeting of the American Associationfor the Study of Liver Diseases. In the first of these multi-centered, randomized, open-label dose-ranging trials, 66patients previously untreated were studied.  The second trialstudied 63 patients who had previously been treatedunsuccessfully with recombinant alpha interferon.The preliminary results of these phase 2 studies areencouraging and clearly justify additional studies to furtherexplore and define the potential use of Natural AlphaInterferon in treating patients with hepatitis C.Chronic viral hepatitis is a liver infection caused byvarious hepatitis viruses.

In the future, genetically engineeredproducts are expected to comprise a much larger proportion ofsales in the Agricultural Group. Although this group accountedfor only 27 percent of the company's total sales in 1994, itcontributed the largest share of operating income and isMonsanto's fastest-growing group. The company expects theAgricultural Group's sales to increase 20 percent annuallyfor the foreseeable future. These, and strategic developmentsin all of Monsanto's other product groups, are analyzed fullyin the new corporate intelligence report C68, MONSANTOCOMPANY.Monsanto, which is the fourth-largest chemical firm in theUS, manufactures agricultural chemicals, geneticallyengineered plants, fibers, plastics, performance chemicals,pharmaceuticals, artificial sweeteners and food additives.

Vinit Saxena, Sepragen president and chairman, saidthe new resin overcomes clogging and other problemsexperienced with traditional separations media which needs tobe pretreated to remove debris and aggregates."Sepragen's new media solves this problem and allowsextremely rapid purification of dirty protein solutions at afraction of the cost of traditional methods," Saxena said."Most media are beads, which are packed into a column and canclog easily. Our material is made out of a special foam-likematerial which has large channels that allow particles to gothrough and small pores for sites for the molecules that needto be bound. No beaded media have this kind of unique porestructure.""This new media fits perfectly into our strategy to developand market complete systems for large-scale purification andprocessing."Sepragen acquired this technology in 1994 through an assetpurchase of BPS Separations in the United Kingdom. The companyspent the last year in additional development of the product,and is currently field testing the resin media. The companywas granted the European patent (#0530258) on Sept. 22, 1995.A United States patent is pending.Saxena said the application possibilities for this resin arenumerous. In the biotechnology area this chromatography mediaenables purification of biological drugs from "whole cellbroth," thereby eliminating several pre- treatment stepsresulting in higher yields, faster processing and lowermanufacturing costs. In the food and environmental areas,where the streams are generally "dirty", this media willenable new chromatographic separations to be performedeconomically for the first time.Sepragen has been involved in the chromatography field sinceits inception in 1985, and introduced its patented Radial FlowChromatography (RFC) columns in 1987. These columns improve ontraditional axial flow columns, a technology some 40 yearsold.Saxena said that adding this resin to its product line movesSepragen closer towards its long range goal of being theleading provider of complete solutions for large-scalechromatographic separations.Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the development oflarge-scale chromatography products and technology for thebiopharmaceutical industry. Sepragen markets its patented RFCcolumns, computer-controlled workstations and processtechnology to the biotechnology, food and environmentalindustries.The company's products are being used by leading biotechcompanies as well as by food companies to produce newvalue-added products and processes.

RCT exclusively licensedthe reagents to Molecular Probes, Inc. in Engene, Oregon in1991 on behalf of Indiana University and the inventors. Dr.Milos Novotny and associates.Molecular Probes incorporated the technology in its ATTO-TAGreagent kits for amine detection, including amino groups inpeptides and glycoproteins. Although nonfluorescentthemselves, they induce fluorescence in amine reactionproducts at wavelengths beyond those of background substances.These characteristics allow ALLO-TAG reagents to minimizebackground interference and greatly increase sensitivity inamine analyses compared to conventional reagents such as o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) and fluorescamine.The reagents enable ultrasensitive fluorescence techniques tobe applied to a wide range of important compounds such aspeptides, amino acids and even carbohydrates. While ATTO-TAGreagents can be used with absorption detection methods, theirsuperior fluorescence properties permit unparalleledsensitivity and detection limits in liquid chromatography andcapillary electrophoresis.Highly sensitive determinations of amino acids and peptidesare among the most important analyses required in research,diagnostic and forensic applications for biochemistry,agrochemistry and pharmaceuticals.In addition to the fluorogenic reagent, ATTO-TAG kits includesamples of potassium cyanide and a protocol for aminemodification. Each kit can derivatize 100-200 samples,depending on amine concentration and sample volume. Kits arepriced at $98 or $78.40 per kit in quantities of five. TheATTO-TAG reagent is also available separately at S110 for 10mg.To place an order, contact Molecular Probes at (503)465-8300,fax (800)438-0228.For further information, call the Technical AssistanceDepartment at (503) 465-8353.

Based onsurvey data collected from 374 biotech executives, the guidebook provides a prescription for industry growth. For copiesof the KPMG report, contact Anna Le Goff, KPMG national lifesciences at (800)330-KPMG or via FAX at (609)896-2968.According to the guide book, managed care providers willaccount for 90 percent of the prescription drug customers inthe United States by the turn of the century. Although thislinkage between biotech companies and managed careorganizations has yet to be fully embraced by the industry,some progressive biotechs have joined forces with HMO's.Collaborations make sense for both parties, according toRobert S. Esposito, national director of biotechnology andlife sciences for KPMG Peat Marwick's Health Care & LifeSciences Practice. Biotechnology companies are affected bythe health care environment emphasis on providing care moreefficiently and more cost-effectively; an emphasis that iseven morepronouncedinthemanagedcarearea.Biotechnology companies can fulfill that joint requirement bydeveloping a product that can, for example, eliminate acostly procedure or reduce a hospital stay due to itsefficacy. The challenge is for those companies to buildefficiencies into their product development process that willhelp reduce the burden of their R&D costs on the bottom line.HMO's and other health care payers have access to billions ofinvestment dollars; biotech companies need partners to funddrug development programs. "HMO's combined have in excess $35billion in reserves available for investment," Esposito says,"which is more money in the aggregate than the majorpharmaceutical companies," he points out. Pharmaceuticalcompanies have historically provided biotech inns with animportant source of equity and revenue streams. Some 61percent of the biotech companies responding to a KPMG surveyhave licensed technology to drug companies in exchange forcash and a future royalty stream.This year marked a significant turnaround in the biotechindustry, according to Esposito. "It is the first time thatrevenue units (premiums) are not going to increase fasterthan the rate of inflation. Clearly, biotechnology productshave to be incrementally efficacious; but they're also goingto have to be cheaper," said Esposito.Pharmacoeconomic studies, conducted as early in thedevelopment process as possible, will become more important inbringing drugs to market, Esposito predicts. "If they don'tconduct these studies," Esposito cautions, "companies run therisk of losing out to the competition on what may have been abreakthrough therapy." Esposito adds, "Pharmaceuticals aregoing to be used increasingly in a very different way. Key tothat is pharmacoeconomics. These studies will be critical forHMO's for the next five years or so."Pharmacoeconomic studies are developed with one overridingobjective: cost effectiveness. "Biotech companies have to maketheir drugs compelling and to be ahead of the competition inorder to make a solid pharmacoeconomic argument; not just abetter drug or that it has a higher cure rate. Instead, thecompany must be able to support its product by stating it willsave the system money versus some alternative drugs or no-drugtherapies."Those companies that incorporate pharmacoeconomic studies inpreclinical trials will be positioned substantially better tomeet changing market trends, including increasing competition."Plus," said Esposito, "HMO's will list those drugs on theirformularies. That's a marketing reality."The KPMG survey data report that about 64 percent ofcompanies in clinical trials made an effort to conductpharmacoeconomic studies before they launched their product.The use of such studies is on the rise. The number ofpharmacoeconomic studies per company rose from 1.7 in 1988to 23.7 in 1994, according to the guide book.The publication's other findings describe an industry intransition. They include the following:* The emergence of a new industry structure based on customerfocus in product development. Although nearly 9 in I *executives (89 percent) report that they are focused oncreating breakthrough therapies, a traditional businessstrategy, companies realize that mastering the clinicalapproval process is key to future development.* Steady industry growth, despite recent downsizing. Between1990 and 1993, the average number of employees at a companyrose from 62 to 99. The average amount of space occupied rosefrom 30,150 square feet to 56,661 square feet.* Recruitment and competitive compensation are the two mostchallenging human resource issues. Companies are out-sourcingfunctions such as money management, regulatory affairs, legalcounsel, and facility compliance to remain as lean aspossible.* The year 1994, while one of the dimmest years for equityfinancing, also saw companies focused on raising capital. Some70 percent of survey respondents report that senior managementand business development teams are actively marketing theirtechnologies to investors.

In theprevious 10 years, however, more than 100 orphan drugs had beenlaunched on the US market and almost all orphan drugs availableworldwide have originated in the US.In Japan, similar legislation has been in effect since 1993 with 29drugs granted protected orphan drug status to date. Of these, five havebeen genetically engineered.A Task Force on Vaccines and Viral Diseases was launched last year byEuropean Commissioners for research and for industry, Edith Cresson andMartin Bangemann (BBN No 113, 1 November 1995, page 7). The Task Forcehas consulted with around 80 potential industrial partners, largeindustrial organisations and the scientific community, identifying theneed for new vaccines for diseases such as Aids, hepatitis,tuberculosis and malaria. Clearly such products should fall within thescope of the proposed Orphan Drug Directive.Little encouragement to dateUp to the present, there has been little in European legislation toencourage the development of orphan drugs. Vaccine companies likePasteur-Merieux, SmithKline Beecham and Evans Medical will rightlyinvest in developments with the best profit outlook.Certainly there are existing Directives 75/318 and 91/507 which makepossible market authorisations under special circumstances for drugswhere full research information is not yet available, where there maybe ethical problems or because of the rarity of the disease. Inaddition, Directive 93/41, which relates to high-technology drugs, hassimilar limitations and provides a 10-year period of exclusivity evenin the absence of patent coverage.None of these, however, provide any financial incentive to encouragepharmaceutical companies to allocate research and development funds torelatively small market sectors.European pharmaceutical organisations are in favour of the idea oflegislation similar to the US Orphan Drug Act providing that itgenuinely provides the necessary stimulus. In the US, the absence ofcompetition for orphan drugs and the lack of established officialprices have encouraged companies such as Amgen (erythropoietin),Genentech and Lilly (growth hormone) and the then Wellcome (AZT), toenter profitably into this restricted sector.Existing European Union legislation through Directives 75/318, 91/507and 93/41, lays down the groundwork; European pharmaceutical companiesare now looking to a European Orphan Drug Law to provide the necessaryfillip.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996GERMANY LOBBIES EU ON NOVEL FOODFRANKFURT - The German consumer watchdog Verbraucherzentrale Hessen(VZH) and the Hesse ministry of social security have initiated a jointcampaign urging changes to the European Union's Novel Food Directive.The campaign is aimed at members of the European Parliament who arerequested to support the labelling of all genetically engineeredfoodstuffs in the forthcoming consultations on the Directive.The campaign organisers plan to distribute 30,000 postcards whichcitizens will be asked to sign and forward to members of the EuropeanParliament. In cooperation with the ministry, the consumer organisationhas also targeted 300 MEPs who had "demonstrated inconsistent behaviourin previous votes on genetic engineering", said Hartmut Koenig of theVZH.The Novel Food Directive, which was approved by the EU Council ofMinisters in October 1995, was inadequate, added Mr Koenig, because itdid not take into account consumer demands for a high level of safetyand transparency for genetically engineered food.Through the campaign, the ministry and the consumer watchdog want tolobby for the "necessary corrections to be made by the EuropeanParliament". They demand a broader scope of application of thedeclaration which would include all foodstuffs produced using geneticengineering and also additives and auxiliary substances such asenzymes."The most serious disregard of consumers' interests has taken place onthe issue of novel food labelling", Mr Koenig said. The position of theCouncil of Ministers was too vague as it only demanded the declarationof food which differs significantly from the conventional product. Thisterm was not being defined precisely enough, he argued.Barbara Stolterfoht, the Hesse Minister of Social Security, criticisedthe German Health Minister, Horst Seehofer: "Unfortunately MinisterSeehofer could not even push through the comprehensive labelling ofnovel food within the Council of Ministers. Consumers therefore need tolobby the members of the European Parliament directly."The European Parliament is expected to reach a decision on the NovelFood Directive in March.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996HAMBURG SETS UP GENETIC TESTING LABHAMBURG - Hamburg in Germany has established a municipal laboratory forthe supervision of genetic engineering experiments.Following the lead taken by Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and Berlin,Hamburg becomes the fourth state to open a laboratory of this kind. Itis the first, however, which is suitable to supervise experiments up tothe second highest security level (S3), according to the Hamburgauthorities."The new laboratory allows us to check whether researchers are actuallyworking with the genetically altered organisms they were givenpermission for", said Fritz Vahrenholt, Hamburg's senator for theenvironment.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996BIOTECH PATENTING IN THE  DEVELOPING WORLDMUNICH - The property rights to biotechnology discoveries made bypharmaceutical multinationals in developing countries need to beestablished and improved.Pharmaceutical companies which develop new plant and animal varieties,drugs or chemicals based on genetic resources should share theirprofits with the owners of the resources on a mutually agreed basis,according to Professor Joseph Straus of the Max-Planck-Institute forinternational patent, proprietary and competition law in Munich.To illustrate the argument, Prof Straus points to the first publicagreement between a developing country and a pharmaceuticals company.It was concluded in 1991 between Merck and the Costa Rican biodiversityresearch organisation, INBio. The arrangement involves the cataloguingof plants and animals in Costa Rica, carried out by INBio, and Merck'sright to screen this inventory for marketable products. The companymade a downpayment of $1 million for this right and will pay furtherroyalties if it discovers a product.The international commitment to take part in such agreements isincreasing, Mr Straus believes, following the setting up in 1993 of theUS International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (ICBG) to promote moresuch partnerships.He outlines this view in an article entitled "Biotechnology andIntellectual Property", published in Legal, Economic and SocialDimensions of Modern Biotechnology, a new volume in a comprehensiveseries on the subject which has now been completely revised. Itaddresses readers working in industry, at universities or publicinstitutions.Apart from the aspects of patent rights, this latest volume looks atproduct development and legal requirements, biotech in a developingworld and public attitudes and political responses towards biotech.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996ISRAEL BACKS SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATIONJERUSALEM - Scientific collaboration in the Middle East is beingactively pursued as the political climate thaws.At the end of 1995, UNESCO, together with the Hebrew University,inaugurated a joint international school for molecular andmicrobiology.Based at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the purpose of the schoolis to further cooperation between scientists and universities in theMiddle East, develop programmes for the training of lecturers andresearchers, and establish links between scientists working inmolecular biology, medicine, biotechnology and microbiology worldwide.In the long run, it is hoped that the school will help to enhance thestate of health of mankind, the provision of food for both humans andanimals, and protect the environment.At the opening seminar, the lecturers discussed different biotechactivities, joint projects already ongoing between Israel andPalestine, and the concept of science crossing national borders.Over the course of three days, the school held sessions given byinternational scientists. This was followed by a two-day workshop,sponsored by UNESCO and Silicon Graphics Biomedical, which includedlectures, demonstrations and hands-on tutorials about computationalanalysis."The programme is targeted mostly at doctoral students right now",according to Yechiel Becker, chairman of the Institute of Microbiologyat the Hebrew University, and the founder and director of theinternational school. "We plan to offer theoretical and experimentalworkshops, teach new techniques and foster good relationships betweenresearchers. Sharing knowledge and advancements in science will promotepeace by enhancing the understanding and cooperation between peoples inthe Middle East and other parts of the world."The agreement to create the international school was originally signedin April 1995. Its theme is "Science for Peace" and it will involvemore than 20 Israeli and Palestinian researchers. Cooperation betweenEgypt and Jordan is also expected in the future.The school will join the UNESCO Global Network for Molecular and CellBiology. Funding is primarily from UNESCO, with the Hebrew Universitysupplying the infrastructure. Other interested agencies and foundationsare welcome to pledge their support.The curriculum for each 10-day session will focus on a major subjectsuch as biotech approaches to microbial agents, molecular biologicalaspects of parasitic micro-organisms, and molecular immunology ofmicrobial infections in man and animal. In addition to lectures andworkshops, students will be able to join one of the research teams atthe Institute of Microbiology for the duration of the session. Atpresent, the budget allows for one or two sessions a year.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996ISRAEL AND KOREA SIGN MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDINGJERUSALEM - A memorandum of understanding for scientific andtechnological cooperation between the Hebrew University of Jerusalemand the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology(KRIBB) has been signed by representatives of the two institutions.The signing took place in Jerusalem attended by Ilan Chet, HebrewUniversity vice-president for research and development, and Kwang-HoPyun, president of the KRIBB.Also present was Hun-Pyo Ha, head of international cooperation andpublic relations for KRIBB, Shabtay Dover, director of the HebrewUniversity's Authority for Research and Development, andrepresentatives of the Israel Ministry of Science and the Arts.The agreement provides for the exchange of faculty members and post-doctoral students, short-term projects for technical training, jointstudy and research activities, and the exchange of scientific andtechnical information, such as books, reports and reference materials.Both sides expressed the hope that a second Israel-Korea biotechconference would take place in Israel this year.

In the mid-1980s, Thailand exported around $70 millionworth of paw-paws, now, however, it cannot supply the domestic market.There is virtually no naturally occurring resistance to papaya ringspotvirus in Thai paw-paw varieties, leaving genetic engineering as themost practical solution, according to Professor James Dale of theCentre for Molecular Biotechnology of the Queensland University ofTechnology.Professor Dale and his team are collaboratingwith the Thai Department of Agriculture and the Malaysian AgricultureResearch and Development Institute.They have successfully developed a method of making Australian paw-pawsdisease resistant by inserting papaya ringspot virus genes into theplants. "So what we have to do is work with Thai scientists to developa similar process specific to Thai cultivars", commented Prof Dale.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996BIOTECH TARGETS ALGAE POLLUTIONADELAIDE - Toxic blue-green algae pollution in Australia is an annualproblem for the country's water control authorities. To address this,the Sydney Water Board is backing  research at the Flinders Universityof South Australia to develop a fluorescent marker that binds tocertain gene sequences of the blue-green algae, enabling their presenceto be quickly detected in water supplies.The project also seeks to inhibit toxin production by blue-green algae.Research leader Amanda Goodman commented: "If we can clone genesinvolved in the toxin production pathway and from that get a handle onhow they are regulated, maybe there is something we can do at theenvironmental level to make sure that even though the bacteria arethere, those particular genes are not expressed."Rather than trying to poison the bacteria, the researchers are lookingat manipulating the environment so that it is not worth it for theorganism to switch on its toxin genes.In other research, funded by the US Office of Naval Research, theFlinders University team is working to combat bacteria fouling onbattleship hulls.Bacteria thrive on immersed surfaces, creating what is known asmicrobial biofilm. On the ship's hull, biofilm forms the basis of afood chain which leads to encrustation, causing serious drag problemsfor the vessel.Previously the remedy was to coat hulls with toxic paints, but theseare now banned because of poisonous leaks. The researchers areoptimistic that their studies into the gene regulation of bacteriawhich adhere to metal surfaces will lead to the design of non-toxiccoatings that will either repel bacteria or cause the biofilm to shedregularly.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996US BIOTECH ESTABLISHES UNRIVALLED POSITIONCAMBRIDGE, MA - In 1995, the US biotechnology industry establisheditself as the unrivalled supplier of new products and technology to thepharmaceutical industry. This leadership position encouraged theinvestment community to add $3.48 billion to biotech cash reserves.During the year, biotech companies formed more than 170 alliances withpharmaceutical partners, with a total declared value exceeding $4.7billion. Among these agreements were a number of strategic acquisitionswhich covered late-stage products as well as enabling technologies suchas genomics and combinatorial chemistry, according to a 1995 review byFeinstein Partners.The average deal in 1995 was $28 million, 35 of which were valued atmore than $50 million. This contrasts with 66 agreements worth a totalof $3.2 billion in 1994. If, however, the 1994 transaction betweenChiron and Ciba-Geigy is excluded, the average deal size for the yearwas only $17 million, with just nine alliances exceeding the $50million mark.$3.5 billion in public offeringsThe significant flow of corporate agreements and headline-makingproduct successes attracted renewed financial interest in biotech.Investors channelled nearly $3.5 billion into biotech public offeringsover the year, compared with $1.8 billion in 1994."The number and size of the alliances underscore the degree to whichthe established pharmaceutical industry is looking towardscollaborations with biotech companies to fill their product pipeline",said Feinstein Partners president Peter Feinstein. "The fact thatlarge, international pharmaceutical companies are both eager to paypremiums for scientific discoveries and are willing to assume approvaland marketing risks gives comfort to the investment community. Theevents of 1995 made it clear that biotech companies can createtremendous shareholder value without necessarily bringing products tomarket themselves."The pattern of large agreements between the pharmaceutical and biotechsectors is forecast to continue as a result of the downsizing of thepharmaceutical industry which has created an increased demand forproduct ideas from entrepreneurial ventures.Notable dealsRecent transactions reflect the importance the mainstreampharmaceutical industry assigns to the emerging technology and productsfrom the biotech pipeline. The Feinstein review highlights inparticular Hoechst Marion Roussel's agreements with ProScript, AriadPharmaceuticals, Cell Genesys and Lynx Therapeutics, and Pfizer'sPfizergen initiative which entailed deals in 1995 with MycoPharmaceuticals, Immusol, AEA Technology and Oxford Asymmetry. It alsonotes several acquisitions, such as the Glaxo Wellcome/Affymax deal,Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's acquisition of the outstanding interest inApplied Immune Sciences, and Sandoz, which strengthened its genetherapy commitment with the purchase of Genetic Therapy.The genomics companies - Myriad Genetics, Genome Therapeutics, SequanaTherapeutics and Millenium Pharmaceuticals - concluded two majoragreements each during 1995, nearly all of which had reported values ofat least $50 million. Both Myriad and Sequana followed the transactionswith successful initial public offerings. A privately heldcombinatorial chemistry company, ArQule, entered into three significantalliances, a $30 million agreement with Pharmacia Biotech, a $50million agreement with Solvay Duphar and a $35 million agreement withAbbott.Second-half pick-upThe bulk of the financial community investment in biotech was carriedout in the second half of 1995, on the back of favourable corporatealliances and product progress. Key mid-year announcements includedCephalon's successful Phase III clinical trial of Myotrophin inamyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, andAutoImmune's Phase II study of Colloral in rheumatoid arthritis.Publicly traded biotech companies raised around $555 million in thefirst six months of 1995 and $2.58 billion in the second half.The pace of IPOs increased in the latter six months of last year. Therewere a total of 29 IPOs by biotech companies in 1995, 15 of which tookplace between October and December."Although the financial community's level of support for biotechapproached the peak year of 1991, investor interest reflected theexperience of prior years", said Mr Feinstein. "Unlike 1991, many ofthe investments were in companies with products in clinical researchand with backing from corporate partners. Companies at earlierdevelopment stages that went public in 1995 tended to have broadenabling technologies and endorsements from multiple corporatepartners", he concluded.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 19961995 - A YEAR TO REMEMBERWASHINGTON, DC - Most US citizens will remember 1995 as the year thepresident and the Congress could not agree on how to balance the budgetresulting in the longest federal government shutdown in the country'shistory.However, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) will remember1995 as "one of the best for raising money, improving stock prices andforging productive partnerships between biotech and big pharmaceuticalcompanies", according to Carl Feldbaum, president of BIO.The biotech industry raised $3.6 billion as of 30 November 1995,compared to $2.2 billion in 1994, the best year on record, according toMr Feldbaum. This does not include milestone payments made in 1995through big pharmaceutical-biotech research and developmentcollaborations, which would add more than $90 million to the total. Andstock prices more than doubled over 1994 closing prices.Partnerships, collaborations and other deals between biotech and bigpharmaceutical companies are "way up", says BIO. In the first threequarters of 1995, some 52 new deals were made, compared with 45 mergersand acquisitions in 1994, totalling $3 billion. M&As between thebiotech companies are also on the rise. In just the first threequarters of 1995, there were 36 M&As between biotech companies,compared with 41 deals for the whole of 1994.1995 also saw some major advances for drugs and agricultural productsin the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA approved four biotechdrugs: Genotropin, Pharmacia; Bio-Tropin, Biotechnology General Corp;Norditropin, Novo Nordisk; and WinRho, Univax Biologics - three humangrowth hormones and a treatment for thrombocytopenic purpura.Two biotech-based drug delivery systems were also approved (twoliposome products), and four drugs already on the market receivedapprovals for additional indications (Intron A, Neupogen, Leukine andRoferon-A).The nine new biotech agricultural products approved in 1995 includedtwo corn plants, a potato plant and a cotton plant with natural pestresistance, herbicide tolerant soybeans, three delayed ripeningtomatoes and high-laurate rapeseed, or canola oil for manufacturing.The advances for the industry in 1995 did not stop at the companylevel. Major efforts to loosen up regulatory restrictions on theindustry were realised this past year.The highlight of the year came in December when Senator NancyKassenbaum, chairperson of the Labour and Human Resources Committee,introduced the first comprehensive bill from congressional leadershipon FDA reform, which includes several provisions endorsed by BIO (BBNNo 114, 22 November 1995, page 1)."Our board's two-tiered strategy of developing an agenda of near-termimprovements in the existing system before promoting longer-termfundamental changes has proven to be the right approach", explained MrFeldbaum. "It made BIO the `voice of reason' in a complex debate andgave us high credibility and a high profile", he added.The US Patent and Trademark Office removed utility guidelines that hadbeen interpreted as requiring human clinical trial data for granting ofa patent on a biotech invention. This was signed into law by PresidentClinton in November.The National Institutes of Health eliminated the "reasonable price"clause from Co-operative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs)that govern technology transfer.On 9 November, Vice-President Al Gore and Donna Shalala, Health andHuman Services Secretary, and FDA commissioner David Kessler announcedthe elimination of establishment licenses and lot release requirementsfor biotech products.BIO also instituted some major changes in 1995, including the electionof a new chairman, Henri Termeer, chairman and chief executive officerof Genzyme, and a new vice-chairman for health, Gordon Binder, chairmanand CEO of Amgen.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996GENE THERAPY - EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIAL BUT OVERSOLDBETHESDA, MD - Scientists, researchers and the news media werechastised for overselling and blowing out of proportion the presentstate of gene transfer therapy in an advisory panel report to HaroldVarmus, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).The report, published at the end of last year, was prepared by anexpert panel of scientists and academics, appointed to assess the NIHinvestment in gene therapy research. Although the panel members wereunanimous in recognising that there is extraordinary potential in thelong term for gene therapy to manage and correct human disease, theywere concerned that: "Expectations of current gene therapy have beenoversold."Mistaken perceptionsFollowing three meetings which included federal and industry scientistsand researchers, and after reviewing major research projects, the panelwrote: "Over zealous representation of clinical gene therapy hasobscured the exploratory nature of the initial studies, coloured themanner in which findings are portrayed to the scientific press andpublic, and led to the widely held, but mistaken, perception thatclinical gene therapy is already highly successful." The report notesthat the current reality is that gene therapy has yet to yieldsignificant therapeutic benefits.Panel members believed that it will require time to develop the scienceof the field and convert advances to clinical practice. Whileexpectations show promise, clinical efficacy has not been definitivelyshown at this time in any gene therapy protocol. The major obstacle tosuccessful gene therapy, the panel asserts, is to find the appropriatevector to transfer the appropriate gene to the appropriate cell and tomaintain its transfer.The first gene therapy occurred at the NIH five years ago, drawing theattention of the scientific and medical communities, media and laycircles. As of June 1995, there had been 106 clinical protocolsinvolving gene transfers on 597 subjects. Presently, the NIH spends$200 million of its $11 million budget on gene therapy. It is estimatedthat private industry's spending on gene therapy research exceeds thatspent by the NIH and underwrites the major proportion of approvedclinical protocols.Panel recommendationsBased on their findings, the panel makes the following recommendations:* Greater focus is required on the basic aspects of gene transfer andgene expression within the context of gene transfer approaches.* Increased emphasis is needed on research dealing with the mechanismsof disease pathogenesis.* Investigators must strictly adhere to high standards in clinicalprotocols.* Broad interdisciplinary training of MD and PhD investigators at theinterface of clinical and basic science should be supported.* Investigators in the field and their supporters need to be morerestrained in their public discussions of findings, publications andgene therapy prospects.* The NIH funding of gene therapy is currently adequate. Future generesearch should compete with other forms of biomedical research understringent peer review. The panel specifically did not recommend specialgene therapy or expansion of the recently funded core vector productionprogramme.* The NIH should encourage collaborative arrangements between academicinstitutions and industry that complement the NIH supported research.* The NIH's intramural research programme needs better coordination ofits scientific review of gene research being undertaken throughout theNIH's intramural research programme to avoid duplication of effort andimprove gene research.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996US FDA YEAR-END APPROVALSWASHINGTON, DC - The US Food and Drug Administration was busy before itstarted celebrating the Christmas and New Year season. It was a goodthing too, because between the 8 and 15 January the agency hibernatedfrom the two feet snow storm and the Martin Luther King federalholiday.Three biotechnology products were approved before the tremendous slowdown:* Amplified Mycobacterium TB Direct Test made by Gen-Probe was approvedon the 18 December, as a fast, new laboratory test to help detect thebacterium that causes tuberculosis. The test was approved for use onlyon specimens of sputum that an acid fast stain has already shown arelikely to be positive for TB bacteria. Expedited review was undertakenby the agency because of its importance to the public health in thecontrol of tuberculosis.The FDA notes that not all patients with TB have the bacteria in theirsputum. For those who do, however, the new test provides reliable,specific results in four to five hours compared with the conventionalculture methods which require one to eight weeks for reliable results.By obtaining results more quickly, the new test will enable doctors tobegin antibiotic treatment earlier. The clinical studies on the safetyand efficacy of the test submitted by the manufacturer was reviewed bythe Microbiology Devices Panel of the FDA's Medical Devices AdvisoryCommittee in May 1995. The studies showed that the new test was 95.5per cent sensitive to detect the TB bacteria that had been identifiedby the acid fast stain and followed up with a culture. Because ofconcern over false negative results, the FDA is requiring that the testbe used along with conventional acid fast stain, then followed up witha culture to confirm the presence of TB.* Anagen of the UK received FDA clearance on the 20 December for itsnew assay to measure testosterone. The developer of automatedimmunoassay systems announced that this marks a range of 16 assayscleared by the FDA for sale on its AuraFlex automated immunoassaysystem. Two more assays have completed development with two more closeto completion. Regulatory submissions for these assays will be madethrough new marketing partners when arrangements have been made.Anagen suffered a major setback when Organon Technik unexpectedlypulled out as a worldwide distributor for the company's lead product,AuraFlex, the automated in vitro immunodiagnostic testing machine,designed by Anagen and built by contractors. Confident of securing amarketing deal soon, the company expects sales to flow within the firsthalf of 1996.* Leukine (sargramostim) was approved on the 22 December, for patientsundergoing certain types of blood-cell transplants. The drug, developedby Immunex, had won approval earlier in the year for treatment ofpatients undergoing bone marrow transplants from matched donors and forpatients with a form of leukaemia. The procedure for blood-celltransplants includes harvesting of blood from patients beforechemotherapy, isolating progenitor cells and then reintroducing themafter chemotherapy to aid recovery. Clinical studies have shown thatLeukine helped increase the number of progenitor cells collected andaided in white blood-cell recovery after transplant.Immunex claims that Leukine is the first growth factor indicated foruse in gathering peripheral blood progenitor cells after transplant.The FDA has declined approval to market the drug in the generalchemotherapy market.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996FDA ADDRESSES INFO DISSEMINATIONWASHINGTON, DC - The US Food and Drug Administration has posted noticeson Advertising and Promotion; Draft Guidances.The two draft guidance documents are entitled: Guidance to Industry onDissemination of Reprints of Certain Published, Original Data andGuidance for Industry Funded Dissemination of Reference Texts. They aredirected to the sponsors of human and animal drugs, medical devices andbiological products to inform them as to what published material ispermitted to be disseminated when discussing FDA approved products.The FDA has taken the position that sponsors may not disseminateinformation inconsistent with the FDA-approved labelling or cleareduse(s). Inconsistent information may be in conflict with the FederalFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Permittinginconsistent information to be distributed by sponsors would encouragethem not to carry out the clinical studies to verify the product issafe and effective for its unproved use. Also information put out by abiased source has the potential to mislead healthcare professionals.At present the FDA has proposed to modified two of its policies whichwould allow sponsors to distribute information under certaincircumstances. In the case of distribution of reprints of published,original data, sponsors may disseminate information and data that theagency relied on for its approval or clearance, even though these maycontain information different from the approved labelling. This canonly be done, however, if the article published the original efficacytrials in accordance with the regular peer-review procedure of thejournal.The reprint must be from a bona fide peer-reviewed journal that usesexperts in the field to review articles. If the information isdifferent from the approved labelling, the reprint must prominentlystate the differences on a sticker attach to the reprint.The second modification proposed concerned industry-fundeddissemination of reference texts. The FDA will permit distribution ofsound, authoritative materials that are not false or misleading andwere written and published independently of the commercial interest ofthe sponsor.The reference text must not be written, edited, excerpted, or publishedspecifically for the sponsor. The text should not be reviewed, editedor influenced by the sponsor or its agent. The sponsor is not to be thesole distributor of the text; rather there should be other distributionchannels where similar books are normally available.Furthermore, the text should not focus on any specific drug(s),device(s), or biologic(s) of the disseminating sponsor. Specificproduct information should not be physically appended to the referencetext.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996FDA ANNOUNCEMENTS AND MEETINGS20 December: Ortho Diagnostic Systems has filed an applicationrequesting approval for the export of the human biological productSelectogen 0.8 per cent, Reagent Red Blood Cells to Australia, Austria,Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland,Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.

Amgenwill also purchase one million shares of NPS common stock for $7.5million, at the market price of the company's shares in November whennegotiations began. NPS expects to have around $25 million in cashafter closing the agreement with Amgen.Amgen will receive exclusive worldwide rights, excluding Japan, China,Korea and Taiwan, to develop and sell Norcalcin, which is currently inPhase I/II clinical trials, and certain other compounds for thetreatment of HPT.

Amgen is also granting back toSugen exclusive worldwide rights to 22 proprietary signal transductiontargets discovered in the course of the collaboration, subject toroyalty payments back to Amgen with respect to potential future productsales.In addition, Sugen is buying back from Amgen 235,000 shares of Sugencommon stock at $11.48 per share, thereby reducing Amgen's currentSugen shareholding to 153,000. At the same time, Amgen will purchasefrom Sugen for $200,000 a seven-year warrant to buy 200,000 shares ofcommon stock at an exercise price of $15.50 per share.Sugen does not expect the terms of the wind-up to have a materialeffect on its 1995 and 1996 profit and loss statements.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996EU DEBATE ON BIOTECH: STILL CIRCULAR, BUT A WIDER CIRCLEBRUSSELS - There was more than a slight sense of deje vu to the high-profile European Union Biotechnology Conference held in Brussels on the11 January.The agenda was familiar - research and public perception, theregulatory framework, and competitiveness. So too were many of thearguments - ranging from the most bullish predictions of biotech'spotential for creating jobs, wealth and well-being, through to direwarnings of the risks it presents to health, ethics and theenvironment. Even many of the speakers were veterans of this long-running EU debate, which has, over recent years, seemed increasinglycircular.The real novelty of this meeting was the fact that it brought togethera wider range of participants - and particularly all three of the keyEU institutions: the Parliament, which had provided much of the impetusbehind the meeting, and was represented by some 30 members, includingfour chairmen of relevant committees; the Commission, which formallyorganised it and fielded an unprecedented high-level turnout, includingfive commissioners and the secretary general; and the Council ofMinisters, with representatives of all the Member States, in many casesat the level of senior national officials, and in some cases atministerial level.European Commission President Jacques Santer had given his fullblessing to the meeting (he was prevented from attending in person onlyby the funeral of the former French president Francois Mitterand), andsent a message stressing that information, transparency and dialogueare the appropriate responses to criticisms, doubts and fears thatbiotech has generated. The Commission acknowledges that publicauthorities will also have to address the issue of "technologyaversion" that biotech has raised.European Parliament Vice-President Nicole Fontaine welcomed theopportunity for the "trialogue" (in the jargon of Brussels) to addressbiotech - one of the "great themes of today" - in a broad context.Current or recent EP debates touching on specific aspects of biotech -on patents, employment opportunities, regulation, research and ethics -had demonstrated how much biotech raised "the most fundamentalquestions touching human beings and their dignity", she said.Professor Giovanni Zanetti, Italian Under Secretary of State forIndustry, as the representative of the EU Presidency, expressedoptimism at the conclusion of the meeting that the exchanges had helpedbuild a sounder base for moving the discussion forward towardsconsensus.But even if the debate is now wider, there were no more conclusionsfrom this conference on EU biotech policy than there have been from themany earlier meetings on the subject in Brussels and Strasbourg. Itcertainly offered an opportunity for everyone involved to get to knowthe points of view of the EU institutions and Member States, as NicoleFontaine observed - which meant that the voices of the biotech backersand its opponents were louder than ever. It is less certain that thetrialogue thus launched will lead to the hoped for "consensus on thedistinct concrete issues", she commented.The European Commission stressed its now well-established view thatbiotech is "one of the most promising and crucial technologies for thenext century", suggesting that European biotech generates turnover ofEcu450 billion a year and in the sectors where it has a direct impact,it accounts for 9 per cent of EU gross value added and more than 8 percent of its employment - more than nine million jobs inbiopharmaceuticals, agriculture and food processing (notably crops andmicro-organisms), and biofuels, bioremediation, and chemicals.But it recognises that the challenge for the EU is now to ensure thatoutput, employment and investment takes place in the EU, rather thanthe EU becoming just a market - it must decide now whether to be aproducer, or merely a consumer, as Commission Vice-President MartinBangemann expressed it. "The world moves on, even if we do not", hewarned in sombre mood.His views were vehemently supported by the UK Under Secretary of Statefor Science and Technology, Ian Taylor, who described the evidence ofEurope's competitive disadvantage as "alarming". In his view, the riskwas that the gap would widen unless EU attitudes to biotech changed anda more encouraging environment was created, with faster and moreflexible decision-making, strong patents, and an open single market."We should not exaggerate the risks by inventing mythical problems", heasserted, "what on earth are we doing trying to invent problems", heasked.In the Commission's analysis, the EU's global position in biotech isnot what it should be. Although it has major core companies and anexcellent research and development base, there are only some 485biotech companies in the EU (a declining number), compared with 1,300in the US. The EU trails the US on biotech patents: between 1978 andJune 1994, EU-based firms filed fewer patents at the European PatentOffice than their US counterparts, and in the pharmaceutical sector, 65per cent of the biotech patents worldwide are US, against 15 per centEuropean. EU investment and research spending is relatively low:between 1986 and the end of 1994, EU-based firms invested more thanEcu2.8 billion in the US and Ecu600 million in Japan; and EU R&Dinvestment in biotech, both from public and private sources, is onlyEcu2.2 billion a year, compared with more than Ecu7 billion in the USand Ecu 2.4 billion in Japan. Heinrich Kolb, Secretary of State in theGerman Ministry of Economic Affairs, confirmed that Germany was alsosuffering from an outward shift in biotech investment.The Commission also admits that the EU regulatory framework has notproved to be so favourable for innovation and technology diffusion:there are no uniform patent rules;  current regulatory oversight ofbiotech at the R&D stage is "not well-adapted", since it makes nodistinction between high-risk and low-risk areas, despite the fact thatmuch of the research in biopharmaceuticals and agriculture consists ofoperations with low or negligible risk; and for important areas such asnovel foods, product legislation is still pending. Even PresidentSanter's message to the meeting recognised explicitly that in thebiotech sector "more and more often European firms prefer to investelsewhere than in Europe".The Commission defends its own record on behalf of the sector, pointingout that it has been active in promoting new legislation and seeking tobring older legislation up to date. It proposed amendments at the endof 1995 to Directive 90/219 on the contained use of geneticallymodified micro-organisms, aimed at a more risk-based regulation. Italso approved a new proposal for a Directive on the legal protection ofbiotech inventions. It is at present carrying out a review of Directive90/220 on controlled release, and a report is expected shortlyidentifying the weaknesses of the current rules and the scope foreliminating or reducing regulatory redundancies without jeopardisingsafety.In addition, the new novel foods regulation, already in theconsultation process (currently at second reading before theParliament), aims, says the Commission, at ensuring safety, consumerprotection and information, while permitting smooth operation of theinternal market, without placing unjustified burden on users andwithout stigmatising the use of modern biotech.President Santer added that in this context the Commission aimed toreview some agriculture rules during 1996 and to see what could be doneto stimulate further innovation among smaller biotech firms.The Commission also offered encouragement to Member States in theirefforts to create a favourable investment climate (especially throughthe development of science parks to stimulate biotech diffusion amongsmall and medium-sized companies). But it is up to the firms themselvesto develop modern biotech-based activities to a critical size, says theCommission. The public authorities' role is to create appropriateframework conditions that ensure product approval according to criteriaof efficacy, safety and performance, and regulatory oversight based onsound scientific principles.Commissioner Mario Monti, the sponsor of the new proposal theCommission launched in December 1995 to provide legal protection forbiotech inventions (BBN No 116, 19 December 1995, page 1), said themotivation behind the new draft was the same as that behind theproposal that was thrown out by the EP early in 1995 after seven yearsof discussion: to bring EU patent laws up to date, and to remove the"unacceptable" uncertainty that continues to reign on patent rights onbiotech.To overcome the reticences over the failed proposal, the new draft aimsto meet the "complementary" demands of all sides: the clear line the EPcalled for between what may be patented, and what may not be; and theCouncil's demand for a text that provided a clear framework and a levelof protection sufficient to promote R&D, said Commissioner Monti.European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler noted biotech'spotential "to introduce improvements in crops and animals which willhave direct and beneficial effects on food quality and the non-fooduses of crops". But at the same time, he warned that this will occuronly if "consumers of agricultural products can be persuaded thatbiotech is being used in a responsible and ethical way". Just because atechnique can be used does not mean that it ought to be used, he said,suggesting that consumers "will judge each case on its merits". Sounless biotech and its benefits are explained to the population in acomprehensive way, advances will continue to be jeopardised by lack ofknowledge and "we may lose the benefits which biotech has to offer".For crops, the Agriculture Commissioner listed scrupulously theadvantages of biotech techniques that are creating disease and pestresistance, diagnostic agents, mechanisms to insert desired productionand quality characteristics, and the introduction of resistance toundesirable environmental factors, as well as improvements tohardwoods, cotton and other fibre crops, such as flax, and cropsengineered to provide wood, starch, oils, fats, and polysaccharides, orto produce energy.He was equally exhaustive in his listing of advances in livestockfarming, for animal nutrition, and in the control of human and animaldiseases.Commissioner Fischler was notably reserved on the genetic modificationof farm animals. While techniques to produce pharmaceutical products(such as sheep able to produce human blood-clotting factors in theirmilk) were relatively uncontroversial, "attempts to produce so-calledsuper animals have not been successful and, indeed, may in the longterm be fruitless", he said.While it is possible to insert genetic material coding for extra growthhormone production into the fertilised eggs of farm animals, "it hasnot yet proved possible to control the expression of these genes in thewhole animal", he insisted, noting that "the uncontrolled expression ofgrowth hormones results in gross and unacceptable deformity andsuffering", and questioning "whether it is economically or ethicallydesirable", even if the process can be fully controlled.Commissioner Fischler's ambivalence was mirrored in the remarks of MEPssuch as Karl von Wogau, chairman of the EP's Committee on EconomicAffairs and Industrial Policy, who endorsed the call for progress, butinsisted on the need to respect ethics and public opinion. Other MEPs,notably Green champion Hiltrud Breyer, were more uncompromising,insisting that the EU's current legislation is better for the biotechindustry than the US system, offering more stability. It would beunhelpful for industry to start modifying that framework again, so soonafter creating it, she argued; the only area she wanted to see changedwas tighter controls to prevent "poor-quality investments" such as, sheinstanced, in the development of recombinant BST.The Senior Advisory Group on Biotechnology said in advance of themeeting that it wants: action on a coherent overall policy promotingEuropean biotech; steady macro-economic policies to attract investment;regulatory simplification; consistent Single Market rule for novelfoods and patents; better links between innovative research andfunding; encouragement for capital investment in biotech start-ups;more efforts to inform the public; employment-friendly conditions;improved education and training; and promotion of the use of biotech tomanage the sustainable use of natural resources.After the meeting, the SAGB's new Director General, Andrew Dickson,told Biotechnology Business News that he felt the meeting had made auseful contribution to "genuine dialogue", and that he perceived agrowing trend of support for industry views.The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations saidit hoped the meeting would help underline the importance of biotech forthe future development of the EU. It wants to see "a policy frameworkto enhance competitiveness and create favourable conditions forindustrial activities related to biotech".It remains to be seen how far the widening of the EU circular debatewill deliver any results that satisfy the "progressives" seekingcompetitiveness without alienating the "conservatives" whose prioritiesare more the ethical, social and environmental considerations,producing nothing more than a new series of stalemates on creatingbetter conditions for biotech in Europe.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996PROGENICS LICENSES MELANOMA VACCINETARRYTOWN, NY - Progenics has licensed a melanoma vaccine from theMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.The vaccine, known as GMK, is one of the most clinically advancedcancer vaccines and is the first of a new class of gangliosideconjugate vaccines being developed by Progenics for cancer therapy.Under the licensing agreement, Progenics receives a worldwide exclusivelicence to the ganglioside conjugate vaccine platform technology forcancer treatment.Two Phase III clinical trials, designed to meet US and worldwideapproval requirements, are expected to begin early this year.

The award was to helpsupport its programme to develop genetically engineered pig organs fortransplantation into patients without clinical rejection.Alexion's genetically altered pig organs express an inhibitor of humancomplement inflammatory proteins to thwart organ rejection. The companyexpects to develop a colony of transgenically engineered pigs and toimplant their organs into primates within 15 to 20 months, followed byhuman implantation.Developing genetically altered pigs for human implantation has becomeextremely competitive as companies strive to be major players in whatis seen as a $1 million annual market. Pigs have been selected becausetheir organs are similar in size to humans and they can be raised, freeof disease, in large numbers. Human DNA is injected into fertilised pigeggs in the effort to have the pigs produce proteins that act tosuppress the organ rejection response.Three other companies are also actively and competitively engaged inthis market - Immutran in Cambridge, UK, has been working to transplantpig hearts into baboons. BioTransplant (Cambridge, Massachusetts), incollaboration with researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, isdeveloping immunosuppressive drugs to ensure tolerance to cross-speciesimplantation. They have also used primates to accept donor organs fromgenetically in-bred pigs. The Swiss company, Sandoz, is helping to fundboth these efforts and expects to spend about $1 billion on this workduring the next couple of years.In July, New Jersey-based Nextran and Duke University Medical Centerobtained clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration to providegenetically modified pig livers as temporary organ support to patientswith end-stage liver disease. It is believed that the livers, placedoutside the body and lasting one day (then replaced by a new pigliver), will provide patient support until a donor becomes available orthe patient's own liver regenerates.The United Network for Organ Sharing claims that there are 18,000heart, kidney and liver transplants performed in the US each year.There are, however, 40,000 qualified patients waiting for usableorgans. Additionally, there are over 100,000 patients, who areclassified as unqualified because of age or disease progression, whodie annually for lack of suitable organs. The US spends $6 billionannually to provide dialysis for 150,000 renal patients; a significantproportion of which could be saved were kidney organs fortransplantation available.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996PEPTOR COMPLETES SECOND FINANCINGNess Ziona - Peptor, an Israeli start-up company developing peptidedrugs, has raised $9 million in a private placement to US institutionalinvestors. The company was valued at $23 million before the offering.Although the company is only three years old, this is its secondprivate placement. Two years ago, it raised $10 million from Israeliand US investors.Peptor hopes to use this latest round of investment to take its twomajor products - an analogue of somatostatin for the treatment ofgastrointestinal disease, and a library of peptides for an antifungalpeptide developed by Xoma - to US Food and Drug Administration approvedclinical trials by 1997.Yoram Karmon, chief executive officer of Peptor, says that there hasbeen pressure on the company to go public. He prefers, however, to waituntil the end of 1996 when Peptor will have achieved more milestonesand will thus have a greater value.Peptor is currently negotiating a possible joint venture with the UScompany, Neoprobe, and with a European multinational. Both of thesepotential collaborations cover the development of peptides to treatcancer.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996SECOND BREAST CANCER GENE ISOLATEDLONDON & SALT LAKE CITY, UT - The second breast cancer gene, known asBRCA2, has been isolated.The UK charity, the Cancer Research Campaign (CRC), announced on the 20December last year that a consortium led by a CRC-funded researcher,had isolated the gene and a patent application had been filed.On the same day as the CRC announcement, Myriad Genetics of the US saidit had filed a US patent application on the full sequence of a "strongcandidate for BRCA2 + [which] covers all diagnostic and therapeuticuses of this newly discovered gene."BRCA2 is thought to be a critical factor for more than one-third ofthose families worldwide with a history of breast cancer in many femalerelatives. It also plays a key role in the development of breast cancerin men in these families.In 1994, CRC researchers reported that BRCA1, the only gene at thattime known to be involved in hereditary breast cancer, was notresponsible for the disease in families which include male breastcancer sufferers. They therefore concluded that another gene must be atfault in these families and located BRCA2 six months later onchromosome 13.Mutations in BRCA2 are believed to be the cause of about 2 per cent ofall breast cancer cases, including a currently unquantifiableproportion of the rare, but often fatal, form of the disease whichclaims the lives of around 100 UK men every year.More genes to be discovered?Recent research suggests that BRCA1 accounts for almost half of the1,000 plus known breast cancer families in the UK, while BRCA2 isprobably responsible for a third. This supports the theory that one ormore family breast cancer genes may remain to be discovered. Scientistsalso believe that BRCA1 and BRCA2 are connected to an increasedincidence of some other cancers, such as prostate and eye cancer.However, the lifetime risks of developing these cancers are much lowerthan for breast cancer.In isolating BRCA2, the CRC researchers at the Institute of CancerResearch worked as part of an international collaboration involvingWellcome Trust-funded scientists at the UK's Sanger Centre and ImperialCancer Research Fund, as well as with Duke University Medical Center inNorth Carolina, US. Additional help came from groups in Iceland, theNetherlands, France and Canada, and the breast cancer charity,Breakthrough.The next stage of research will examine both the function of BRCA2 andthe consequences of gene damage, and the role of the gene in non-familybreast cancers.The CRC's technology transfer arm, CRC Technology, filed a preliminaryUK patent application on the research findings in November. The claimsof the application have not yet been defined but are expected to coverthe gene sequence and its use for new approaches to the prevention,diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.MyriadMyriad said that its scientists had cloned and obtained the completesequence of the gene and had confirmed through familial analysis ofbreast cancer cases that mutations in it predispose certain women toearly onset of the disease.Myriad comments that it expects to launch a test in the second half of1996 for mutations in BRCA1, which was isolated by the company andcollaborators in 1994, and intends to develop a test that incorporatesBRCA2.A spokesperson for CRC Technology told Biotechnology Business News thatit was unclear at present whether both patent applications covered thesame gene, but expected the position to be clarified in the nearfuture. They added that the CRC believes that it was the first toisolate the gene.Each year in the UK, more than 31,000 women have breast cancer newlydiagnosed and 14,500 die of the disease.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996AGOURON TO STUDY NEW ANTICANCERSSAN FRANCISCO, CA - Agouron Pharmaceuticals plans to initiate work ontwo new anticancer drugs this year, according to company president andchief executive officer, Peter Johnson.Speaking at the Hambrecht & Quist 14th Annual Life Science Conference,Mr Johnson told delegates that preclinical toxicology has begun for thefirst product candidate, AG2034, an inhibitor of an enzyme required forthe synthesis of purine nucleotides essential for sustainedproliferation of cancer cells. AG2034 has shown potent antitumouractivity in preclinical animal models of cancer.The second compound, AG3340, has been selected for development as ananticancer from Agouron's programme to discover selective inhibitors ofmatrix metalloprotease enzymes involved in cancer and arthritis. AG3340has demonstrated significant antimetastatic and antitumour activity inanimal models, as well as oral bioavailability and a favourablepharmacokinetic profile.R&D updateOther research and development progress to date includes the completionof a clinical programme of four-week pilot Phase II studies of severaldifferent dose regimens of Agouron's anti-HIV product, Viracept(nelfinavir mesylate, formerly known as AG1343). The studiesdemonstrated that Viracept has potent acute activity against HIV.The anticancer, Thymitaq (AG337), is being evaluated in six separatePhase II clinical trials against solid tumours associated with lung,colon, liver, pancreatic, prostate and head/neck cancers. The trialshave enrolled a total of 120 patients.Mr Johnson noted that Agouron is in a "strong financial position" tocarry out its R&D programmes. In the current fiscal year to 30 June1996, the company expects to report around $40 million in R&D-relatedrevenues from corporate partners and is positioned to fund the balanceof its near-term operating expenses from cash and short-terminvestments currently in excess of $100 million.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996SEQUANA LINKS GENE TO MELANOMASAN DIEGO, CA - Scientists at California-based Sequana Therapeuticshave identified a second gene responsible for malignant melanoma, adeadly form of skin cancer related to over-exposure to the sun.Around 33,000 people in the US a year are diagnosed with melanomaresulting in about 7,000 deaths. However, most cases can be cured ifcaught in the early stages.Using DNA samples from the National Cancer Institute, NicholasDracopoli and colleagues at Sequana examined DNA from members offamilies with hereditary melanoma. After excluding families withdefects in a known cancer gene, the researchers found that two of theaffected families had a mutated form of the CDK4 gene.The scientists identified a germline mutation (which means it can bepassed from parent to child) in the CDK4 gene and were able to screenpatients who inherited the defective form of CDK4 and advise those whowere most susceptible to developing the condition to get regulartesting to find the melanoma at an early stage.Although it is unlikely that mutations in CDK4 will account for all ofthe remaining cases of familial melanoma, this mutation suggests thatother genes in this pathway may be excellent candidates, note thescientists in the January issue of Nature Genetics.Sequana said it plans to seek patent protection for its discovery andwould continue to study what role the CDK4 gene plays in other forms ofcancer.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996PERSONALITY GENE DISCOVEREDWASHINGTON, DC - Two groups of scientists working in differentcountries have found a link between a gene that affects brain chemistryand a normal aspect of personality, reported Nature Genetics.Researchers from Herzog Memorial Hospital in Jerusalem led by RichardEbstei, and the Laboratory of Clinical Science at the NationalInstitute of Mental Health, led by Jonathan Benjamin, independentlytested a hypothesis advanced by Robert Cloninger and colleagues at theWashington University School of Medicine: that novelty seekingbehaviour is affected by the way brain cells process dopamine, a neuralmessenger chemical.Both groups detected a correlation between different D4 dopaminereceptor genes (D4DR) and variation in a human personality trait. D4DRcomes in various alternative forms, some in a long series of sequencesand some in short. Those individuals with the long sequence score highin the novelty seeking personality trait, making them "moreexploratory, thrill-seeking and excitable", write the researchers.Those who have the shorter sequence score lower in the novelty seekingbehaviour, "more deliberate, rigid and orderly.""This work provides the first replicated association between a specificgenetic locus involved in neurotransmission and a normal personalitytrait. Given the significant hereditary nature of many human behavioursand the rapid progress of the human genome project, it is likely thatadditional genes that influence normal and abnormal psychologicalcharacteristics will be found in the future," noted the Israeliresearchers.All subjects in the two studies differed in age, sex and ethnicbackground. In fact, the scientists also found that the relationshipbetween the long sequence and novelty seeking did not vary with age,sex or ethnic background.The US researchers noted that although the findings in the two studieswere remarkably similar, they do not feel that "novelty seeking iscompletely mediated by genes and that D4DR accounts for some but notall genetic defects."Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996LQT SYNDROME GENE FOUNDSALT LAKE CITY, UT - Researchers from the University of Utah (UT) haveidentified a gene which has been linked to a rare inherited heartailment known as long-QT (LQT) syndrome which can cause sudden death inotherwise healthy people.Reported in the January issue of Nature Genetics, Mark Keating and UTcolleagues found the third gene, KVLTI, linked to the most common formof LQT, afflicting some 50 to 60 per cent of all cases."KVLTI turns out to be a potassium channel that is also most likelyinvolved in cardiac repolarisation", noted the scientists. Six monthspreviously, the UT researchers had identified a pair of genesresponsible for two other forms of LQT. These were also ion channels,another potassium channel and a sodium channel. The researchers expectthat this more common form of LQT should be able to respond to drugsthat open potassium channels.Rapid progress anticipated"With the majority of LQT cases now at least partially understood atthe molecular level, there should be rapid progress in finding out howto treat these disorders", the researchers noted.LQT syndrome, although rare, is well-known because it often results insudden death. LQT can be worsened by the use of some drugs,particularly those used treat cardiac arrhythmias. The danger of theuse of such drugs and the deadly nature of the disorder makes earlydetection vital. Dr Keating said the discovery of the third gene willhelp in the early diagnosis of LQT.LQT syndrome affects some 20,000 people in the US and is believed tocause up to 20 deaths a year.Back to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY BUSINESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996SMITHKLINE EXTENDS SUPPORT TO DEVELOP VACCINE FOR HEPATITIS ESMITHKLINE BEECHAM has extended its financial and technical support toa US-based programme to develop a vaccine for hepatitis E.

Thecompany's lead product is the immunotherapeutic, SRL 172, a newtuberculosis treatment currently in Phase III trials in South Africaand Phase II trials in the UK. Development programmes include work onthe application of SRL 172 as a treatment for cancer and HIV. Shares inStanford Rock have soared since the start of the year, up from 265p atthe 1995 year end to 375p on the 16 January, valuing the company at #66million.David Kennard, managing director and ex-Glaxo Wellcome, said: "The leadindication of our lead product is TB and associated HIV-relatedinfection. We are well into Phase III studies - a 400-patient placebocontrolled study. We hope to launch the product in 1998. Being anorphan drug status product, we hope to get a favourable review uponsubmission.""They have got some serious credibility behind them", observed ananalyst. "The rumour is that they have got some licensing deal comingout with a major pharmaceutical firm in the near future, and that theyare now making noises that their immune stimulant is effective infighting Aids".Chiroscience gained 9p at 323p on the 16 January on news that it hasgained regulatory approval for Phase II clinical studies of its singleisomer treatment, D3967, for hormonally sensitive breast cancers. Thisis the company's third single isomer drug to go into the clinic. "Theapproval to start the trials is goods news in that the company can stepforward, but it does not mean that they have a result that shows itworks yet", explained an analyst. Chiroscience is nonetheless seen asone of the strongest stocks in the UK biotech sector.Also tipped as undervalued are Cortecs and Scotia. The latter hassuffered over the past few months on reluctance among some investors toaccept the company's science. The shares however gained 20p to 583p onthe 16 January. "Many see the company more as a nutritional OTCbusiness rather than a biopharmaceutical company. The management ofScotia have got more science credibility than many of the rest in thesector", noted one analyst.Cortecs has the potential to be one of the sector's best performingstocks in 1996. It is riding high on the prospects for three majortrends in the pharmaceutical industry - the increasing resistance ofbacteria to antibiotics, osteoporosis and diabetes management. "Cortecshas a lot to go for in those three years. If it gets its oralcalcitonin drug licensed out, and launches its diagnostics on to themarket, I can see the share price more than doubling", opined one Cityfollower.Recently floated issues appear to be performing well. PeptideTherapeutics, at around 220p, is holding steady at a 10 per centpremium over its flotation price. KS Biomedix is trading up 15 per centon its recent placing, price while PolyMasc Pharmaceuticals is upalmost a third on its initial placing in December.US analysts expect the recent pick-up in the biotech sector to continuethroughout 1996. Stocks are expected to appreciate on an anticipatedflow of positive product development news, with US Food and DrugAdministration approvals expected to sustain the sector's positiveinvestment climate.Somatogen, up $1-7/8 at $20-5/8 in early January, is seen as one of themost promising US biotech firms. Late Phase II clinical trials on itsblood substitute product have shown positive results. If successful,the product has a $1 billion-plus market potential. One analyst set a12-month price target of $50 on the stock.Liposome shares fell $1-1/8 to $20-7/8 on the 12 January on news thatone analyst forecast a 12-month price target of $7.Salomon Brothers rates Amgen one of the year's star stock picks,arguing that with an estimated average annual earnings growth rate ofmore than 20 per cent between 1996 and 1998, the shares aresignificantly undervalued. Trading at $55-1/8 last week, Salomon hasset a one-year price target of $65. Both old and new products are saidto be selling well. On the development front, clinical trials areexpected to start this year on Leptin, Amgen's anti-obesity drug andGDNF, for Parkinson's disease.

Currently, more than one woman in three over the age of 50 suffersosteoporotic fractures caused by weakened bone. That percentage works outto an estimated 25 million people in the U.S. As the Baby Boom aged, theraw numbers had been expected to soar even if the percentage stayedunchanged but now there's new hope for treatment. Men also suffer fromosteoporosis, but in fewer numbers and with a later onset.   The body remodels bone continually, tearing it down and rebuilding, muchas the skin is continually made and sloughed off. Like the skin, bone growsthinner with age as the rebuilding process loses ground. Key players in thecycle are bone-destroying cells, called osteoclasts, and bone-buildingcells, or osteoblasts.   ``If you reform less bone than is being broken down,'' Hodsman says,``you ultimately end up with less bone.'' There are two main approaches toavoid bone loss -- prevent the bone breakdown or stimulate new growth.``You either work on expenses or you work on income,'' Hodsman says.   The main approach has been to tackle ``expenses'' -- preventing boneresorption, or breakdown.   Estrogen and estrogen-like molecules are perhaps prototypical. In theabsence of estrogen -- after menopause, for example -- bone resorptiongains the upper hand. The obvious solution is to replace the missinghormone.   And indeed millions of women across North America and Europe beginhormone replacement therapy shortly after their menopause, with apparentsuccess in retaining healthy bone. The problem is that estrogen replacementhas side-effects that make it very unpopular with women -- headaches,bloating, breast engorgement and, of course, the continuation or resumptionof the menstrual cycle. Estrogen has also been linked to some forms ofbreast cancer.   ``It's not very customer-friendly,'' Hodsman says. Less than 10 per centof women take estrogen for any length of time, leading him to say thetherapy is essentially a failure, even though it does preventosteoporosis.   Until a few years ago, hormone replacement was almost the only treatmentoption available to physicians. (The hormone calcitonin is approved forosteoporosis and does increase bone mass, but it must be given byinjection, which is unpopular, and its effectiveness appears to diminishover time.)   But a range of new drugs -- the aminobisphosphonates or justbisphosphonates -- is now reaching the market and their promise isexciting.   ``The advantage of the bisphosphonates is that they're entirely specificto bone, while other drugs act on every tissue,'' says Marc Grynpas, abiophysicist at the University of Toronto who's studying the long-termeffects of the drugs on bone strength and on body chemistry.   On the other hand, Grynpas says, a drawback of bisphosphonates is thatthey're not particularly well-absorbed by the body. The skeleton getsperhaps 40 to 50 per cent of injected bisphosphonates and only about half aper cent of oral formulations.   The earliest of the bisphosphonates was etidronate, made and marketed byProcter and Gamble under the name Didrocal. Although etidronate is approvedin many countries as a treatment for osteoporosis, it has never been giventhe nod in the United States, largely because the clinical trials did notattempt to show a reduction in fractures.   But studies at the University of Western Ontario and elsewhere in theearly '80s clearly showed, Hodsman says, that etidronate increases bonemass in osteoporotic patients and that was enough to prompt otherpharmaceutical companies to try their own hands at findingbisphosphonates.   The first into the market with FDA approval is Merck & Co., with abisphosphonate called alendronate and trade-named Fosamax. The companysubmitted its NDA March 31 last year and got approval a mere six monthslater on Sept. 29.   Robert Lindsay, who's president of the National Osteoporosis Foundationand director of the metabolic bone disease unit at St. Luke's RooseveltHospital in New York, called alendronate ``pretty exciting. It gives us afurther option for women who cannot or won't take estrogen.''   Alendronate is perhaps 1,000 times more potent than etidronate, Hodsmansays, which makes it easier for clinicians to use. A drawback withetidronate was what Grynpas called its `'narrow therapeutic window'' -- toolittle did nothing, too much actually damaged bone. Finding the small gapbetween too little and too much was tricky.   ``Because alendronate is a lot more potent,'' Hodsman says, it overcomesthat problem. ``You can afford to give it every day; it does the same jobas etidronate'' only more quickly and more efficiently.''   It may even be appropriate to use alendronate and other third-generationbisphosphonates as a preventive measure, he says.   A Merck spokesman wouldn't comment on how well sales are going since theSept. 29 approval, but said the drug was available in pharmacies veryquickly afterward. The company says a month's supply should cost about $55;the wholesale price per 10-milligram tablet is $1.39.   Merck's data, from trials involving nearly 1,000 women, show meanincreases of up to 10 per cent on bone density in the lumbar spine. Thealendronate reduced the fracture rate by 48 per cent compared with theplacebo group.   Side effects, Merck says, are mild -- abdominal and musculoskeletalpain, as well as some digestive disturbance -- and generally don't causepatients to stop taking the drug. In fact, more patients in the placebogroup than the drug group dropped out because of adverse reactions.   Although Merck temporarily has the field to itself, a wave ofthird-generation bisphosphonates is coming down the pipe and they're all,Hodsman says, ``serious contenders.''   -- Sanofi Winthrop Inc. has tiludronate in Phase III trials. A spokesmansaid a New Drug Application for Paget's disease -- a rare bone degenerativeillness -- will be made soon but couldn't say when the NDA for osteoporosiswould be filed.   -- Boehringer Mannheim Corp. is in Phase II/Phase III trials withibandronate. A spokesman wouldn't speculate on when the trials willconclude. Interestingly, the company has equipped a Bluebird motor homewith bone-scanning equipment and is using it to conduct the Phase III partof the trial in rural Montana.   -- Procter and Gamble Corp. is in Phase III trials with risedronate. Aspokesman wouldn't say when an NDA filing is expected.   -- Ciba-Geigy Inc. has stopped work on one bisphosphonate and is in whata spokesman called ``early development'' with another. Ciba is no longerstudying pamidronate for osteoporosis, although it is approved for someother kinds of bone deficiencies, and is doing preliminary work onzoledronate.   The bisphosphonates aren't the only anti-resorptive approach. Eli LillyCo., of Indianapolis, is in Phase III trials on raloxifene, which is,Hodsman says, ``a very interesting drug.''   Raloxifene, initially developed as an anti-cancer agent, is one of agroup of compounds known as selected estrogen receptor modulators -- theytarget different receptors differently.   Raloxifene appears to block only gender-specific estrogen receptors --those found in the uterus and breast -- while actually boostingnon-specific receptors. The result appears to be an estrogen-likeinhibition of bone resorption, without the side-effects of estrogenitself.   ``It seems fairly close to a magic bullet,'' Hodsman says. ``It mightactually reduce breast cancer risk while doing what you'd like an estrogento do -- slow bone resorption'' and thus prevent osteoporosis.   Kelly Sego, a spokesman for Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, said raloxifeneisn't the only arrow in the company's quiver, although it's the mostadvanced. ``We're also looking at any number of derivatives ofraloxifene,'' she said.   The company's ``best case'' date for an NDA filing would be sometime in1997, Sego said. Eli Lilly started Phase III trials in January, 1994, andplans to look at interim data in mid-'96, she said. ``If those data showwhat we think they'll show,'' she said, ``then we'll start working on anNDA.''   An attack on the other half of Hodsman's equation -- ``income'' orbuilding bone -- is also imminent. Mission Pharmacal of San Antonio, Texas,is on the verge of getting the go-ahead to market a slow-releaseformulation of sodium fluoride.   The FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committeerecommended approval for the drug Nov. 17, but a company spokesman didn'tknow when the final marketing approval would come through.   Sodium fluoride, in conjunction with calcium citrate supplements, haslong been known to increase bone mass, but it also causes severegastrointestinal distress, including gastric ulcers.   The slow-release formulation -- a honeycomb wax tablet that allows themineral to bypass the stomach and dissolve slowly in the intestines --appears to avoid the harmful side-effects.   The trials showed a 70 per cent decline in the spinal fracture rateamong treated patients and increases in bone mass in the spine of up to 6per cent a year.   There had been fears that bone growth stimulated by sodium fluoridewould be histologically abnormal but Charles Y.C. Pak of the University ofTexas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who conducted the trials,said, ``We not only found more bone in the patients we studied, but whatappears to be stronger bone.''   The treatment regime -- 25 milligrams twice a day, combined with 400milligrams of calcium citrate -- will cost less than $1 a day, a companyspokesman said, making it cheaper than alendronate. However, thetherapeutic window for sodium fluoride is regarded as narrow.   Meanwhile, Toronto's Allelix Biopharmaceuticals is in the last stages ofa year-long search for an industrial partner for Phase III trials of itsrecombinant parathyroid hormone (rPTH). A spokesman said a deal is likelyto be announced in the first two week of 1996.   The drug -- Allelix calls it ALX1-11 -- has been in Phase II trials at18 centers across Canada and the U.S. and so far data show it can add``significant amounts of new bone in osteoporotic patients,'' accord toJohn Dietrich, the company's vice-president of research and clinicaldevelopment.   Hodsman said the bone-building effect of PTH has been known since the'70s, but before Allelix learned how to produce a recombinant form it wastoo scarce to be of any use. `'You had to do large studies,'' Hodsman said-- something that was impossible without large supplies of the hormone.   He said studies using the hormone -- both recombinant and natural --have ``consistently shown that bone mass is increased at least as fast as(sodium) fluoride and fluoride is double the speed of anything else.''   But the advantage of PTH, he said, is that there's no toxicity and thebone it builds in patients is probably normal. In animals, bone built byAllelix's rPTH has been shown to be histologically normal.   PTH is a major regulator of the speed of bone remodelling, Hodsman says,but the mechanism isn't completely clear. ``We don't fully understand whyPTH works as well as it does,'' he said.   For instance, he said, it has been shown that osteoclasts(bone-resorbing cells) are much less vigorous when they are exposed tobisphosphonates. ``With PTH, we don't even know as much as that,'' he said.``It could be it makes osteoblasts more vigorous or it could be that itrecruits osteoblasts'' by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more ofthem.   With all those drugs in the pipeline, people at risk from osteoporosishave a bright future, Hodsman says: ``We're on the cusp of revolutionizingthe management of osteoporosis.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY NEWSWATCH via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   HEREDITY PLAYS ROLE IN OSTEOPOROSIS, BUT GENETIC LINK PROVES ELUSIVEBy:MS   Heredity clearly plays a role in the likelihood of developingosteoporosis, but researchers are not entirely sure if there is a directgenetic key to the disease, according to Laurence Rubin, who studies thecondition at Women's College Hospital in Toronto.   In 1994, a team of Australian researchers reported that the gene thatcodes for the Vitamin D receptor is linked to the speed at which peoplelose bone mass as they grow older.   The Australians, led by John Eisman of the Garvan Institute of MedicalResearch in Sydney, say they can predict the approximate age of onset ofosteoporosis depending on which alleles of the Vitamin D receptor gene arefound.   But other researchers aren't convinced: the September issue of theJournal of Bone Mineralogy Research devotes space for three articles andtwo editorials on the question without, Rubin says, coming to aconclusion.   ``The answer is not in yet,'' he said.   Even without the Vitamin D hypothesis, Rubin says, there's evidence fromtwin studies and other population studies that osteoporosis has ahereditary component.   But it could simply be that closely-related people tend to have similarskeletons, according to Anthony Hodsman, a clinician and osteoporosisresearcher at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont.   On that hypothesis, he said, women with small, fragile bones would tendto develop osteoporosis more than others and so would their closerelatives. But there would not be a single gene or complex of genes thatcaused the condition.   Rubin said the Vitamin D link may turn out to predict accumulation ofbone mass and density during the early years of a person's life. He isstarting a long-term study of 700 young women at Women's College Hospitalto determine, among other things, their Vitamin D receptor status.   But predicting bone mass may be of limited use: ``Women even at the samelevel of bone density fracture at different rates,'' Rubin said. ``Theissue is the quality of the bone.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY NEWSWATCH via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   AFTER THOUSAND-YEAR SLEEP, LOTUS SPROUTS CHEMISTRY OF LONGEVITY THEORIESBy:MB   Ancient lotus seeds, recovered and germinated after lying dormant forcenturies in a dried-out lake bed in China, are giving scientists newinsights into the biochemistry of longevity.   ``We're interested in what new things the lotus can teach us aboutaging,'' not just in plants but in humans as well, said Steven Clarke, aUniversity of California at Los Angeles biochemist. Clarke analyzed thechemical make-up of two of seven ancient seeds given to UCLA scientists bythe Beijing Institute of Botany in the early 1980s. These seeds indicatethat, if everything goes right, the potential for cellular life ``isprobably much longer than we thought,'' Clarke said.   Jane Shen-Miller, a UCLA plant physiologist coaxed a shoot from a lotusseed estimated to be 1,288 years old. It had been recovered from Pulantien,China, which had been a lake where lotus plants were cultivated up to about1484, when, geological records show, an earthquake drained it.   This seed may be the oldest ``demonstrably viable and directly datedseed ever reported, the preserved relic of one of the early crops of lotuscultivated by Buddhists,'' who hold the lotus as sacred, said Shen-Miller.Other claims of viable seeds found in the relics of antiquity, includingsome from King Tut's tomb, could not be confirmed or were hoaxes.   ``This sleeping beauty, which was already there when Marco Polo came toChina in the 13th century, must have a powerful genetic system to delay itsaging,'' said Shen-Miller, who published a paper describing the germinationof the seeds in the American Journal of Botany last November. Anotherlotus plant was grown from a seed 322 years old.   Clarke said that he was given two of these seeds -- a 95-year-old onethat was able to germinate and a 416 year-old one that was not. When hebroke through the thick skins, he was amazed by ``how healthy the embryoslooked.'' Clarke and a post-doc then ground up the embryos and assayed themfor repair proteins.   Upon examining the lotus embryos, Clarke found levels of L-isoaspartylmethyltransferase (MT), a protein repair enzyme, that were equal to thosefound in fresh seeds. This enzyme, found in all tissues and especially inseeds, plays a role in limiting the accumulation of damaged proteins instorage and may help plants adapt to environmental stresses, such asdrought.   His lab was the first to identify MT as an enzyme involved in proteinrepair. It fixes proteins by straightening out the ``kink in thepolypeptide chain'' that occurs during a cell damaging chemical processknown as isomerization.   Clarke is currently conducting experiments in various models, and has sofar knocked out the MT gene in bacteria and worms. He found that theMT-deficient organisms do not last as long as those with an intact gene.His lab is moving on to mouse experiments.   In other research, Clarke is gathering blood and cheek cell samples fromhealthy people over age 85. He is looking at the levels and quality ofrepair MT in these people, using PCR to find variants in the MT gene, whichis located on chromosome 6.   ``Do they make it because they have a super efficient variant of thisenzyme?'' he said.   On the flip side, studies of fibroblasts from victims of progeria, adisease of abnormally rapid aging, have shown no difference in MT levels.   Although MT appears to be an important contributor to longevity, Clarkepoints out that the enzyme is most likely just one of many of the lotusseeds' life-preservers.   ``These seeds survived because everything went right,'' said Clarke.   The tough outer skin that provides an air- and water-tight chamber forthe embryos was one important element in their survival, wrote Shen-Miller.The scientists also found high levels of ascorbic acid and glutathione, twoagents that are effective in maintaining functioning proteins.   Clarke anticipates that scientists are going to identify many morerepair enzymes.   ``What we may find is that our repair kits are a lot more effective thanwe thought,'' said Clarke, whose lab is looking at protective strategies inseveral different kinds of plants. Clarke hopes that further study of thelotus, which has been used for thousands of years in Chinese pharmacopoeia,may reveal other secrets of its longevity, including some of the otherenzymes that repair damaged proteins.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY NEWSWATCH via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   RESEARCHERS FIND GROWTH HORMONE A DRY HOLE IN SEARCH FOR FOUNTAIN OF YOUTHBy:By Mike Pezzella   A decade ago genetic engineering made human growth hormone available inlarge quantities and opened a floodgate of claims that the Fountain ofYouth was about to flow into the world.   While recombinant human growth hormone, rhGH, has helped some childrenwith growth problems -- at a price of $10,000 to $30,000 a year -- ithasn't banished wrinkles or the decrease in muscle protein mass, strengthand bone mineral density that shows up in the decades after 60.   ``If you take growth hormone, maybe it makes you look younger, butyou're gaining fluid. You're filling in the wrinkles, you fill them up withfluid,'' said Dr. Kevin E. Yarasheski, of the Metabolism Division andSection of Applied Physiology at Washington University School of Medicine,St. Louis, Mo.   Yarasheski and his colleagues at Washington, Jeffrey J. Zachwieja, JillA. Campbell and Dennis M. Bier, studied the effect of growth hormone inolder men.   The 23 men ranging in age from 64 to 75 followed a 16-week program ofresistance exercise that went from moderate to high intensity incombination with administration of growth hormone or a placebo. The purposewas to see if growth hormone (GH) treatment would result in a greaterincrease in muscle strength, whole body and skeletal muscle proteinsynthesis rate, or a greater reduction in fat mass and myofibrilar proteinbreakdown rate in older men than an identical training program without GH.   Instead of the fountain of youth, Yarasheski and his team found a poolof fluid. During the study GH treatment was cut off to several of theparticipants who developed symptoms of carpal tunnel compression and fluidretention in hands and feet. Eight of the 13 GH recipients were able tocomplete the 16-week course of the study.   ``We found that GH produces no gain in strength or muscle mass withoutexercise,'' said Yarasheski.   The result in the study of older men duplicated results Yarasheski gotin a similar 1992 study of young men. Then, Yarasheski monitored 18 menranging in age from 21 to 34. They were followed on a 12-week course ofheavy resistance exercise training using Nautilus equipment.   ``No one has ever measured fluid retention in past studies that showweight or mass gain in growth hormone use. People might link greater bodymass and lack of wrinkles with youth. So when they retain fluid and put onextra weight they associate that with the feeling of well-being they hadwhen they were younger,'' said Yarasheski.   ``What they are doing probably is filling in the wrinkles with fluid,they are not getting rid of the effects of aging,'' said Yarasheski.   He did admit that the ``filling in'' of wrinkles can produce at least ashort-term change in appearance that might make someone sensitive to agingfeel better. But when it came to discussing muscle building, Yarasheski wasdefinite: ``Lean tissue? No, it is fluid retention.''   ``We used the Genentech hormone, it's just about the same as the Lillyhormone,'' said Yarasheski.   Yarasheski is currently completing a third growth hormone studyinvolving women as well as men. This time the subjects are not being madeto exercise because the researcher said he is beginning to think that GH``doesn't add anything'' to the subjects.   ``Exercise is so powerful, that it creates an effect that eitherovershadows the effect of growth hormone or it creates the entirebeneficial effect itself,'' said Yarasheski.   The current study involves more than 30 individuals including eight ornine women. He said the Washington University team has found that womenrespond to growth hormone ``pretty much the same as men,'' in previousstudies.   There has been no gain in strength or muscle mass without exercise.   Yarasheski said that he is puzzled by why growth hormone treatment doesnot produce a marked effect.   He said that it may be that scientists have not yet learned how to setthe proper dosage for the hormone. He also speculated that exercise mayproduce such a powerful effect on the body that it cancels out everythingelse when it is in use. He also said that scientists have theorized thatas yet unknown individual characteristics may decide who will respond tothe hormone or that the hormone is a short-term drug against which the bodydevelops an immunity. That would explain why young subjects respond to GHtherapy and why adults and older people apparently do not.   Yarasheski is currently writing the paper on his latest GH study andexpects to have the results about the use of the drug on women and men whodid not exercise ready to publish by the end of 1996.   In the meantime the hormone treatment is being marketed by mail-orderfrom the Bahamas via slick magazine ads from Palm Springs as a way toextend life, increase bone and lean muscle mass and improve cardiacfunction.   If nothing else, Yarasheski said, the fluid retention can make peoplefeel better about themselves because they may look more like they did whenthey were young. What the scientist called a kind of mirror therapy.   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Genentech, maker of the hormone used byYarasheski, said the company was doing no work on use of their product inthe aging.   ``We work very closely with Genentech, but we are not giving them theanswers they want,'' said Yarasheski. ``But those are the answers we aregetting.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY NEWSWATCH via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH TO TAKE NEW DIRECTION IN '96By:RR   Last year, two clinical trials of biotech drugs to prevent age-relatedmacular degeneration ended with negative results. But others may beginwith different drugs within the next 18 months, according to the studychairman of an international macular degeneration study group.   Age-related macular degeneration, which progressively leads toblindness, affects approximately 600,000 Americans each year. Thecondition is characterized by a loss of sight due to functionaldegeneration of light-sensitive, retinal nerve cells at the back of the eyethat distinguish fine detail at the center of a person's field of vision. The less common ``wet'' type of the disease, involving abnormalblood-vessel growth, quickly leads to blindness, compared to the morecommon ``dry'' form, which has a much slower onset but sometimes convertsto the ``wet'' disease.   In April, Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., announcedthe cancellation of its macular degeneration program when interim data froma Phase II trial found no significant effect from its transforming growthfactor (TGF) beta-2 product, BetaKine (see BTNW, May 17, '93, p. 10). Infact, the pullout resulted in a subsequent restructuring of the company --and the departure of Celtrix's original President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer (CEO), Dale Stringfellow, who now works at Berlex Laboratories onunrelated projects.   Celtrix's new President/CEO, Andreas Sommer, said work with BetaKinewill probably continue on a substantially different ophthalmologic disease:macular holes.   ``There is a fairly good rationale'' for using the tissue-repaircapability of the drug there, Sommer said. ``It appears that TGF-beta hassome repair activity on this hole. In macular degeneration there is nosuch thing.'' He said macular degeneration is a ``very complex processthat is unrelated to tissue repair.''   In November, the Pharmacological Therapy for Macular Degeneration StudyGroup (PTMDSG), comprising 53 centers worldwide, ended a placebo-controlledtrial, involving 53 centers worldwide, of Hoffmann-La Roche's interferonalpha-2a (Roferon-A) in 500 elderly patients with the ``wet'' form ofmacular degeneration.   PTMDSG study chairman David Guyer, who runs the retinal program at theManhattan Eye, Nose and Throat Hospital in New York City and is a clinicalassociate professor at Cornell, said ``it's going to be a negative study''when the results are put together and reported in the literature.   Interferon was ``shown in the test tube to stop abnormal blood vesselsfrom growing,'' he said, ``and it works for vascular tumors in humans tocause regression of blood vessels, so there was strong, scientificrationale'' for the trial. However, he said, ``it may have just been thatnot enough drug penetrated'' the retina to make a significant difference. ``It's very hard to know why it didn't work.''   However, Guyer said, ``there are future studies with other companiesthat haven't been announced.'' Within the next 18 months, he said, ``I'dexpect one and maybe two major studies on synthetic drugs, potentially, tobe started. We should know in the next two months or so if they will befunded or not.''   Guyer said ``there are two good candidates,'' and perhaps ``three orfour others, depending on further testing,'' to go into new clinical trialsfor age-related macular degeneration. One -- a new biotech drug that hewould not name -- is an ``extremely good candidate,'' he said. But thecompany that developed and owns it must first ``agree on an expensiveprogram to go forth on it,'' he said. The company must ``first agree thatthey're going to increase production, do all the safety studies, etc., etc.So it's a huge cost to them. My feeling is, I think they're going to gowith this one.''   ``We should hopefully know within the next four to eight weeks'' whetheror not it will proceed, Guyer said.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY NEWSWATCH via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   ON THE TRAIL OF APO E GENE IN THE BRAIN, LOOKING FOR ALZHEIMER ORIGINSBy:By Marjorie Shaffer   Like detectives gathering evidence at the scene of a crime, researchersare tracking the footprints of the polymorphic apo E gene in the brain,hoping to find the mechanisms that lead to the destruction of neurons, thetangles and the plaques peppering the brains of Alzheimer's patients.   The search is yielding tantalizing clues to the origins of the mostcommon cause of dementia in the elderly, and may one day provide a way toactually prevent or slow a disease that is said to be the fourth-leadingcause of death in the United States. Some four million Americans haveAlzheimer's, and the disease kills 100,000 people annually. It typicallystrikes after the age of 65.   The research is also providing a possible window into other kinds ofdementia associated with AIDS and the loss of memory associated withaging. Although much of this research is still in its infancy, the effortsbeing made to understand Alzheimer's will undoubtedly help unlock themysteries of other diseases that tear the tissues of reality and memory.   And, perhaps most importantly, the research reveals that Alzheimer's andother neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging, are not caused byone factor like a bacteria or a virus, but are a result of multiple factorsthat produce multiple forms of a syndrome.   ``Aging isn't the explanation for the loss of memory. Instead, memoryloss is a biological mechanism, perhaps a disease process, that we need tounderstand,'' said Zaven Khachaturian, the longtime director of Alzheimer'sdisease research at the National Institute on Aging, who is now anindependent consultant in Bethesda, Md.   ``We don't know of a way to prevent any of the dementias and I don'tfind it useful to categorize the dementias into different forms,'' saidKhachaturian. ``It is a generic problem that in all cases involves a lossof neurons in a particular part of the brain. The solution is to find a wayto slow down the process in Alzheimer's, and once we find that we couldapply it to other diseases. We need to attack the fundamental process toinsure that neurons remain functioning for a lifetime,'' he said.   In healthy individuals, overall, there are some changes that occur whenthe brain ages, although the evidence is still murky, according to BarryGordon, director of the department of cognitive neurology at Johns HopkinsUniversity School of Medicine. The hippocampus, for example, an importantarea linked to learning and memory, may become less effective, and theremay be a loss of neurons in the cortex, said Gordon.   ``But this is a very controversial topic. The old saw about losing10,000 brain cells a day in the cortex is simply wrong. It is very tough tocount brain regions, and we don't lose nearly as many neurons in the cortexas people once thought.   ``The most universal phenomenon of age is slowing,'' said Gordon. ``Whenwe age we don't necessarily lose our memory, we slow down, our thoughtprocesses take longer.''   In contrast, the dementia associated with Alzheimer's is far moreprofound. It affects not just memory, but language, concentration and manyother aspects of ``cognition.''   Researchers are taking a variety of approaches to attacking theAlzheimer's disease process, but most are in some way linked to the apo Epolymorphism. In one of the latest research advances, a team led by JudesPoirier at McGill University found that Alzheimer's patients who didn'tcarry the apo E4 allele, the so-called ``bad'' form of the protein,responded dramatically to Cognex, a medication that increases the amount ofthe nerve messenger acetylcholine in the brain. Neurons producing thebrain chemical degenerate in Alzheimer's patients and the chemical iscrucial to learning and memory.   Another retrospective study by Martin Farlow at the University ofIndiana found the same correlation between the apo E genotype and theresponse to Cognex.   ``Dr. Poirier's observation is exciting but extremely preliminary,''said Norman Relkin, director of the memory disorders program at CornellUniversity Medical Center. ``It needs to be replicated by other groups andhas to be tested in a prospective fashion,'' he said.   The exact role of apo E itself is still not understood, but the proteinis made mainly in the liver and it shuttles cholesterol among the body'scells. It is also produced in the brain, and there it has been linked toregeneration and repair of neurons, among other possible roles. Recently,for example, Allen Roses' group at Duke University found the protein in thepost-mortem brain tissues of normal, non-demented individuals as well as inthe tissues of Alzheimer's patients. Apo E has also been found in theamyloid plaques of the disease, and the protein has been implicated in theformation of tangles in the brain that are composed of a mutated form of acommon protein called tau.   Two years ago the Duke University group reported a link between apo Eand Alzheimer's disease and since then many studies have verified theoriginal finding. The three forms of apo E, 2, 3, and 4, are now linked todifferent probabilities of getting the disease: in the worst case two dosesof apo E4 are associated with the highest risk. Yet the picture iscomplicated. Because there are three alleles of the same gene, there aresix possible combinations of apo E, and form number 2 may even protectagainst the disease. Furthermore, some 10% of individuals with two doses ofapo E4 will not get the disease.   Some experts estimate that roughly 40% to 60% of Alzheimer's diseasepatients are apo E4 carriers; and about 80% of the general population maycarry at least one dose of E3. But tests for apo E are only recommendedas an additional piece of information for individuals who are alreadyexperiencing symptoms of Alzheimer's, according to Neil Buckholtz, actingassociate director for neuroscience and neuropsychology at the NationalInstitute of Aging. ``This whole issue of apo E isn't clear yet at all,''said Buckholtz. ``Large-scale epidemiologic studies need to be done, andtesting isn't recommended for people who don't have symptoms,'' he said.``Apo E4 interacts with tau protein and AB protein in plaques and atremendous amount of research is now being done to either block apo E4 ormimic apo E2.''   Other groups are devising ways to prevent the deposition of the smallprotein called AB peptide that is the main component of the amyloid plaquesof Alzheimer's. And still other groups are testing new compounds thatincrease the production of acetylcholine or corticotropin releasing factorin the brain, or regulate calcium in neurons.   Possibly a definitive treatment for Alzheimer's may require severalapproaches, mirroring the disease itself, according to Gordon of JohnsHopkins. ``It is likely that what we call aging is a whole series ofproblems. If you own a car, as it ages a lot of things go wrong,'' hesaid.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY NEWSWATCH via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   REACHING 100: IS IT TORTOISE MEAT, MARTINIS OR GENES?By:By Mara Bovsun   What's the secret of long life?   Ask any centenarian and you'll hear a lot about sturdy ancestors,healthy habits and an upbeat attitude. One 114-year-old African womanreportedly attributes her age to a diet of pumpkin seeds, locusts andtortoise meat. Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, the world's oldest human beingat over 120, advises people to ``Always keep your smile.'' Broadway legendGeorge Abbott who died last year at 107, said his secret was: ``Have fun,and go home when you're tired.''   Then there's 99-year-old comic George Burns whose longevity prescriptionincludes 10 to 20 cigars and three to four martinis a day, along with apassion for his work.   ``And I don't eat spinach,'' he told Larry King in an interview lastJuly.   While gerontologists try to find some pattern in the daily habits of theoldest old -- people who were born in the last century -- biochemists armedwith the new tools of molecular biology are looking for chemical andgenetic bases of long, long lives.   What they've found so far appears to be the molecular equivalent oftortoise meat and martinis.   ``What we don't know is really overwhelming,'' said molecular biologistDavid B. Finkelstein, director of the pathobiology program at the NationalInstitute on Aging (NIA), which devotes roughly $450 million annually tothe study of growing old, from neurological degeneration to genetics. Ofthat total, up to $60 million goes to the program on the biology of aging,focusing on the cellular and genetic mechanisms that lead to signs ofphysical old age -- compromised immune systems, wrinkles, blindness, muscleloss, bone thinning and dementia.   Although modern theories of aging go back at least 30 years, whenLeonard Hayflick posed his idea that the lives of cells are measured by amolecular clock, Finkelstein said there's a need for much more research --and new researchers -- before any of the current concepts can be proven.   ``At this point we know, the one thing we know for sure, no doubt, is ifyou calorically restrict an animal, it will live longer and be healthier,''said Finkelstein. In flies and rodents, cutting food intake by 30 percentextended life. Studies in primates are just getting underway, led byresearchers at the University of Wisconsin and at the Gerontology ResearchCenter in Baltimore. Finkelstein said that the hope of researchers is tofind out what kinds of physical reactions are triggered by caloricrestriction, so that scientists might be able to replicate them.   The goal of these scientific inquiries, say scientists, is not simply toextend life span, but to delay for as long as possible the onset of diseaseand disability. In 1992, diseases afflicting Americans over the age 65accounted for nearly 38 percent of the national health care bill of $800billion, according to a report by the American Federation for AgingResearch (AFAR) and the Alliance for Aging Research.   ``If the option is to have everyone live to 120, and the last ten yearsof their life to be in a wheelchair, with Alzheimer's and immobilized, whowants it?'' said Dr. Finkelstein.   In this century, improved nutrition, sanitation and medical care raisedthe average life expectancy from 49 years to 76 years. By the year 2,000,that life expectancy will be about 85 years and more and more people seemto be hitting the century mark. In 1970, the U.S. census counted only about3,300 people who had made it to 100. By 1990, there were more than 35,000centenarians   But there is a vast difference in their health and how they live. Someare so vital that they continue to work and even participate in sports,such as one 100-year-old swimmer who competes in the backstroke in theSenior Olympics. Others are simply holding on to life, confined towheelchairs and nursing homes.   One important question that must be answered is ``what is normal agingand what is pathological?'' said Finkelstein. Studies -- such as theBaltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) at the Gerontology ResearchCenter in Baltimore -- are trying to establish benchmarks for what can beconsidered normal in healthy old people. BLSA has about 1,100 activeparticipants, said Finkelstein, who come in every year or two for a batteryof tests.   The NIA is planning to start a study of the ``oldest of the old,''establishing a cell bank of those unusual people who reach 100. Finkelstein said that it will most likely get started in the next fewyears, after the agency has determined how to handle the ethical issuesinvolved with collecting samples and obtaining informed consent. In France,scientists at the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine have establisheda cell bank of their oldest citizens and are already looking for genes thatare common to them.   Finkelstein said that the NIA is funding several lines of research inthe genetics of aging. A lot of backing is going into investigations intogenes that produce super oxide dismutase (SOD), a mechanism that protectscells against oxidative damage.   Another hot area is advanced glycosylation, a process of bindingproteins and glucose molecules, he said. ``This has been a very eclecticarea until people discovered receptors that can identify these advancedglycosylation products,'' said Finkelstein. Glycosylation may be related toheart disease, and researchers have compounds to reverse this process inclinical trials. Other NIA-funded research has found several genesconnected with longevity in C. elegans, a microscopic worm, and yeast.   The theory of the telomere clock has aroused considerable excitement inrecent years, both for its relationship to aging and its impact on cancer.Telomeres are DNA repeats -- TTAGGG -- at the tail end of chromosomes. Eachtime cells divide, the strands become shorter, until the cells reach astage when they enter senescence and are no longer dividing. Researchindicates that such cells accumulate, producing substances that result inthe breakdown of healthy tissues.   Geron Corp., a biotechnology company in Menlo Park, Calif., has beenconducting research for several years into the role of telomeres in agingas well as the role of an enzyme, called telomerase, in the process ofimmortalizing cells, which turns them cancerous.   In a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences, Geron researchers reported that telomere length can be used as amarker for human vascular aging, implying that the accumulation ofsenescent endothelial cells may contribute to clogging of the arteries andblood clotting.   According to Geron's Calvin B. Harley, the research is the ``firstevidence utilizing the techniques of telomere biology to suggest that theaging of vascular cells contributes to atherosclerosis and possibly othercardiovascular diseases.'' Measuring telomere length might be a usefulmethod of predicting the onset of atherosclerosis.   The impact of these senescent cells on the body is key area ofinvestigation, said Finkelstein.   ``We know cells become senescent in vitro. We only have recent evidencethat they become senescent in vivo as well.''   Rather than simply lying dormant, these non-replicating cells exudesubstances that damage surrounding cells and cause age-related problems.   Judith Campisi, a senior scientist at Berkeley National Laboratory, isone member of a scientific team that developed a simple, rapid test forsenescent cells, and the accumulation of these cells, in living organisms.The assay measures levels of the enzyme beta-galactosidase (BG), which isproduced by senescent cells. Until now, the only way to study cellsenescence was to culture cells until they stopped replicating.   This fast, inexpensive assay allows researchers to find senescent cells by determining whether the enzymatic marker is present.   Specific cell types have their own markers indicating senescence, saidCampisi. In skin cells, for example, an enzymatic marker is theover-production of collagenase, an enzyme that breaks down collagen,causing the skin to collapse. Wrinkled skin is one result of thismechanism, she said.   Scientists are exploring strategies to reverse the properties ofsenescent cells responsible for age-related destruction, without ignitingthe cell's replicative powers. If that were to happen, the result could beuncontrolled cell growth -- cancer.   ``The idea of balance has to be taken quite seriously,'' she said.   Geron is working in this area, and has licensed the BG test for use inits program to find drugs to modulate the phenotype of senescent cells.   Premature aging conditions -- such as progeria -- are also offering aglimpse into the biology of longevity. These rare syndromes may be causedby a defect in a single gene, making them easier to study than normalaging, which is most likely controlled by a complex of genes.   Genetics of aging expert George M. Martin has established a registry ofpeople suffering from Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease thatcauses 20-year-olds to develop age-related ailments such as prematurebalding, osteoporosis, heart disease and diabetes. The gene for thissyndrome has been tracked to chromosome 8, and scientists believe they areclosing in on it. Martin, professor of pathology, adjunct professor ofgenetics and director, Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University ofWashington, Seattle, is also investigating the genetic basis forsusceptibility and resistance to Alzheimer-type dementia as well as lookingat the somatic mutations that break down cells.   Overall, researchers in aging seem to be traveling down two paths --those exploring aging as an accumulation of cellular insults -- such asoxidative damage -- and those seeking inborn mechanisms that pre-setcellular life-span, said T. Franklin Williams, scientific director of AFAR,which has devoted about $13 million over the past 14 years to scientists inthe field and has earmarked another $20 million to support scientists overthe next five years.   Most likely, he said, a person's life span will be determined by acombination of genetic programming and cell damage.   ``We all have a mix of factors that will eventually do us in,'' saidWilliams. ``It is a very individual matter as to what the ultimate lifespan will be.''   For now the outer limit for the life of one human being appears to bearound 110, with few, like Jeanne Calment, stretching it, to thebewilderment of scientists, for up to a decade more.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY NEWSWATCH via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   ARTHRITIS RESEARCH: DRUG COMPANIES FOCUS MOSTLY ON RHEUMATOIDBy:By Reginald Rhein   The two major forms of arthritis -- rheumatoid and osteoarthritis --both are inflammatory diseases of the joints. But they are very differentdiseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, can strike atany age; it most commonly affects the joints of the hand, wrist, elbows andshoulders. Osteoarthritis (OA), considered a disease of aging, attacksonly the cartilage, and most often causes disability in the knees, hips,and spine.   Many companies are trying to develop drugs against RA, but only a feware specifically tackling OA, even though the potential market is more thansix times as large (16 million Americans have OA vs. 2.5 million with RA). Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have beenthe first line of therapy for both conditions since the beginning of thecentury, and most clinical trials still involve NSAIDs. The PharmaceuticalResearch and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) lists 20 companies with drugsin clinical trials against RA and seven for OA, with five of the drugs intrials for OA also in RA trials.   Part of the lack of interest by biotechnology companies in OA was that,until very recently, OA was considered the result of ``wear and tear'' ofaging joints, while RA -- caused by the body's immune system attacking thesynovium, or joint lining -- was considered potentially more amenable tointervention with biotech drugs. Thus, clinical trials with monoclonalantibodies or other drugs have attempted to block RA's autoimmune cascade,which starts with the release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by macrophages, andcontinues when the IL-1 and other stimulatory factors ``dock'' to thereceptor molecules on other immune cells -- or on cartilage or bone cells-- and trigger the release of enzymes that ultimately destroy the synoviummembrane. No similar therapeutic targets were thought to exist for OA.   ``Osteoarthritis is a problem of articular cartilage, which is thegliding surface of the joint,'' said Steven Trippel, professor oforthopedic surgery at Harvard University and Massachusetts GeneralHospital. ``The difficulty of that disease -- at least viewed from oneperspective -- is that the homeostasis, which is the balance betweendegradation and repair, is lost.   ``In normal tissue, in almost every tissue in the body, there is someturnover of the tissue occurring,'' Trippel said. ``That's true inarticular cartilage as well. And the matrix, the material that is therubbery, very slippery gliding surface that allows the joint to functionproperly in a normal joint, is slowly turning over. That means that youcould view osteoarthritis as the failure of the balance between repair anddegradation of this matrix.''   Trippel suggested that biotechnology could be used to inhibit the lossof the matrix. ``One way of doing that would be to use gene therapy,'' hesaid. ``Another way would be to use medication or already-fabricated geneproduct that could be put into the joint or delivered to the body in someother way. But the principle would still be the same; that is, to try toinhibit the loss of matrix which characterizes the disease.''   The second approach, Trippel said, is to ``increase the repair side ofthe homeostasis equation.'' For this, growth factors could be sought thatact on articular cartilage to enhance repair -- and perhaps slow down oreven reverse the process of osteoarthritis. ``That would be reallyexciting,'' he said.   ``There is work going on in this area, trying to understand the effectof growth factors on articular cartilage,'' Trippel said. ``But to myknowledge there is no good experiment out there that shows, definitely inan animal model, for example, that if you give a single growth factor thatyou can correct the disease.''   Several OA studies in animals are currently underway, however, includinga gene-transfer study in rabbits, which is being undertaken by ChristopherEvans, associate professor of orthopedic surgery and molecular genetics andbiochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.   ``The OA work is part of a larger program where we're trying to use genetransfer techniques to address a number of joint diseases, including bothrheumatoid and osteoarthritis, as well as to enhance the repair of jointsfollowing injury,'' Evans said. His group has focused on the synoviumarticular cartilage, meniscus and ligaments, he said. ``In the context ofOA, I guess, the key one is the articular cartilage,'' Evans said. ``We'rein the process of transferring various genes, both marker genes andpotentially helpful genes, into the articular cartilage of rabbits.''   Evans said he has ``toyed with the idea'' of transferringmetalloprotease inhibitors to rabbit joints, since metalloprotease isspecifically associated with OA, but ``we've not given that a priority.'' Most of the group's early work was in RA, where anti-inflammatory geneswere put into synovium. ``Just in the past couple of years we've expandedinto OA,'' he said.   For Trippel, the ``best'' and ``most encouraging'' animal study he hasseen is one by Richard Rogachefsky and his colleagues at the University ofMiami School of Medicine and the University of Texas Health Science Centerat San Antonio. ``That group showed that if you gave a particular growthfactor called insulin-like growth factor 1, IGF-1, with an additionalmolecule that influences the effect of IGF-1, you could actually helpprevent osteoarthritis in a canine model,'' said Trippel. The study,published in the Journal of the Osteoarthritis Research Society --Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (Vol. 1, 105-114, 1993) -- found ``in a modelof mild OA, therapeutic intervention with IGF-1 and PPS [sodium pentosanpolysulfate] appeared to successfully maintain cartilage structure andbiochemistry.''   For Brian Butcher, group vice president for research at the ArthritisFoundation in Atlanta, Ga., ``probably the most exciting thing that'shappened in the past few years'' in OA has been the discovery by DarwinProckop, who directs the Jefferson Institute of Molecular Medicine at theJefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, of a gene associated withosteoarthritis. About three years ago, Prockop isolated a point mutationin a type II collagen gene in members of a family prone to developingearly-onset OA. All those with the disease had the mutant gene, while allthose without the gene did not have OA. Prockop said he has now scannedabout 40 other families and found the gene in about 3 percent of OApatients. He estimated that about 10 genes are involved in making theproteins responsible for strong cartilage.   Prockop said he is currently participating in a gene therapy trial of arelated disease, osteogenic imperfecta (OI), at St. Jude's Hospital forChildren in Memphis. He wants to successfully complete this trial beforeattempting to correct the genetic defect in OA patients, since OI is a farmore serious affliction than OA. In the OI trial, bone-marrow cells will beremoved from the patients, normal genes will be inserted ex vivo, and thecells will be replaced in the patients' cartilage, Prockop said.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightBIOTECHNOLOGY NEWSWATCH via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996   TOWA, CORTECS IN OSTEOPOROSIS PACTTowa Pharmaceutical, a major manufacturer of generic drugs, has signed anagreement with Cortecs International to co-develop an oral preparation ofsalmon calcitonin (an osteoporosis remedy) currently under development bythe British company.

He stressed the necessity of treatment aimed at eradication ofhepatocellular carcinoma from the hepatitis treatment stage. Omata saidthat at present hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 83% of patients withhepatitis C and 11% of those with hepatitis B.   Based on comparative data between patients with hepatitis treated or nottreated with IFN, hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in 2,200 patients per100,000 of the population in the untreated group. But in the treated group,this figure is reduced to 600 patients. This indicates that IFN treatmentof hepatitis inhibits the onset of the cancer.

Having a good productpipeline towards the year 2000, we can continue to launch novelproducts one after another from this year (1996).  Therefore, wehope we can raise our market share in Japan around the year2000," said Mr. Robert Rubens, president of Zeneca Yakuhin in arecent interview with PHARMA JAPAN.   Zeneca Yakuhin reached sales of 62.5 billion yen on an NHIprice basis for the financial year ending December 1994, with amarket share of approximately 1%.  The company ranked 31st amongall pharmaceutical manufacturers in Japan and 9th among foreign-affiliated firms in 1994.   As of the end of the third quarter of 1995, Zeneca Yakuhinattained sales of 47 billion yen on the NHI price basis.   Terminating a sales consignment agreement with SumitomoPharmaceuticals, Zeneca Yakuhin started an independentdistribution system after the completion of an distributioncenter in Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture in January 1995.   "Thanks to a lot of help from Sumitomo and appropriatepreparations for the self-distribution made with Sumitomo,transferring to the independent distribution system went well,"said Mr. Rubens.   He went on to say, "We get a high estimation from medicalinstitutions through our wholesalers because we can have directcontact with wholesalers.  The experience we have accumulated incollaboration with Sumitomo is very helpful in building up thegood relationships between us and our wholesalers, and betweenmedical facilities and us."   Currently Zeneca has approximately 60 pharmaceuticalwholesalers as distributors for Zeneca products.   The Ministry of Health and Welfare and the pharmaceuticalindustry are now deliberating an MR qualification (orcertification) system.  It is said that the MR qualificationsystem will be introduced next year.   Mr. Rubens told that Zeneca has already established anintensive special training system to improve individual MRs'knowledge about Zeneca, its products, and the medical andpharmaceutical sciences, in addition to an ordinary MR trainingprogram.  He added, "Since such training for products areconducted by therapeutic category such as oncology,cardiovasculars and anesthesiology, the responses from medicalinstitutions to our MRs are very good."   Mr. Rubens added, "We've already prepared for implementationof the forthcoming MR qualification system."   He stressed that the role of MRs will be of increasingimportance under the current circumstances where more attentionis paid to the proper use of drugs, patient information ondrugs, and safety information.   Looking at the recent regulatory activities, we can see thatthe Ministry of Health and Welfare established three studycommittees on measures to ensure drug safety and on the measuresto promote appropriate use of drugs and on reviewing packageinserts, and another study committee has already released thefindings of a study on informed consent.   As he mentioned earlier, he is confident that Zeneca's marketshare will expand more than expected around the year 2000because it has a promising pipeline as mentioned below.   NDAs have already been filed for Zoladex (goserelin acetate),an LHRH analogue for gynecological disorders such asendometriosis and myoma of the uterus, and Casodex, an oralanti-androgen for prostate cancer, in addition to the launch inearly December 1995 of Diprivan (propofol), an IV anesthetic forinduction and maintenance of anesthesia.   Seroquel, a dopamine and serotonin antagonist forschizophrenia, Accolate, an oral leukotriene antagonist forasthma, and Arimidex, an aromatase inhibitor for breast cancer,are in Phase II.   Tomudex, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor for colo-rectalcancer is in Phase I.   Mr. Rubens expects that these products will be mainstays ofthe company in the near future because the oncological,anesthetic, and asthmatic fields are growing therapeutic ones.   Touching on the NHI price recalculation and generic listingproblems on which Chuikyo (the Central Social Insurance MedicalCouncil) made a recommendation on November 22, 1995, heregretted that the Chuikyo discussions centered not on the realvalue of drugs but on the cost of drugs, and thatrepresentatives from the pharmaceutical industry were notallowed to participate in the discussions as regular partners.   He emphasized that the disadvantages brought about by the newrepricing rule for already-listed drugs based on therecommendation may impair the research and development ofinnovative drugs in the future.  In addition, they may deprivepatients of their benefits despite the fact that a decision wasrecently made on increasing premiums for innovative new drugs.   "However," Mr. Rubens said, "we wish to continue to carry outour mission to produce valuable drugs and supply patients withthem."   From November 30 through December 1, ICH-3 was held inYokohama, where progress was made in international harmonizationof regulatory requirements.   Mr. Rubens said that ICH-3 has apparently born fruit and thatwill be especially favorable to multinational pharmaceuticalmanufacturers in reducing the duplication of dossiers for NDAsand eliminating a waste of time and cost.  "The success of ICH-3will enable us to easier develop innovative new drugs in threeregions -- Europe, the US, and Japan -- simultaneously," hesaid.   "Therefore, I hope the 'global dossiers' will become areality in the future," he added.   Zeneca Yakuhin, a Japanese subsidiary of Zeneca Group plc, isin charge of distribution and sales promotion for Zeneca'sdrugs.   Zeneca Group, which are currently comprised of threedivisions -- pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialties --was demerged by ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) in the UK in1993.   Tenormin and Inderal have been well known as the world's twomost widely prescribed beta blockers since the former pharmadivision of the ICI launched these products.  Furthermore,Zeneca has drugs for breast cancer, prostate cancer andantiseptics.   Zeneca group spent 83 billion yen in R&D expenditure on salesof 717 billion yen.  It has 7,000 researchers among 30,000employees worldwide.   In addition to Zeneca Yakuhin -- 60% and 40% of whose stocksare owned by Zeneca Ltd and Sumitomo Chemicals, respectively, --Zeneca has another subsidiary named, Zeneca KK which isresponsible for developing and manufacturing products in Japan.Des: ZHB00/ZNJ50/ZNJ60Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Looking Forward to Working Together   -- Carl F. Taeusch, Japan Representative, PharmaceuticalResearch and Manufacturers of America   As we look ahead to the year of the Rat, one wonders whetherit could possibly be as eventful as the year of the Boar.  ForPhRMA in Japan this past year meant a changing of the guard --from Bryan Wright, who retired to the countryside of Englandafter a long and distinguished career in the pharmaceuticalbusiness, including the last two years as Japan Representativefor PhRMA, to Carl Taeusch, who left Merck & Co of New Jersey,USA to take on this new assignment from July 1.   This is my second term of extended residency in Japan inconjunction with the pharmaceutical business.  My earlierexperience started in March of 1984, when I came as a lawyer forMSD Japan just after Merck's acquisition of a controllinginterest in Banyu Pharmaceutical.  The problems we faced as anindustry (in contrast to the problems of individual companies)then were not that different from the problems facing us now --in brief, cost containment -- but there is more of a sense ofcrisis now as the government struggles with an ever risinghealthcare bill caught between the weakened economy and thespecter of a growing elderly population with greater demands onthe system.   During the 1980s, while pharmaceutical prices in mostcountries normally rose reflecting inflation, in Japan theindustry had to deal with price cuts, irregularly at first, butsoon to become a biennial ritual.  By 1991, the anxietypreceding the rituals became somewhat more predictable with theintroduction of the R-zone.   During 1995, the whole litany of horrors has been laid beforeus.  Repricing has taken on a variety of meanings: in additionto the biennial price "revisions," we are told that prices willbe cut if sales exceed official forecasts, or there are changesin the conditions of the original price listing, or if newindications are added after listing.  Older products werethreatened with even sharper cuts, to bring their prices more inline with their generic competitions.  There was talk torethinking the entire pricing system, including elimination ofthe R-zone.  More recently, the Ministry of Health and Welfarehas suggested that pharmaceutical companies should bear allpatient treatment costs which coincide with a clinical trialsponsored by a company, including costs related to a preexistingcondition and not to the trial itself.   All these were raised in 1995; some have been decided uponfor implementation in April, 1996; other decisions have beenpostponed for further consideration.  As my colleagues Bob Flussand Hiro Shigeta have pointed out separately, these issues havebrought the Japanese, American, and European Associationstogether with a common goal to clarify our positions withChuikyo (the Central Social Insurance Medical Council) and theMinistry of Health and Welfare and to try to deflect thoseproposals which make the least sense.  There has been remarkableunity.  For me personally, it has been a unique opportunity toget to know my colleagues in the three associations, as well asthe players at the Ministry and on the Chuikyo more quickly thanmight otherwise have been possible.  In the coming year as theissues become more focused, we will continue to work together,not only to seek the most cost effective solutions, but also toreach out to patients to see that their interests are notforgotten as the reforms take hold.   From PhRMA to all, a happy and successful 1996!Des: ZHB00/ZNJ50/XAN00Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Monitoring Implementation of Kengisho Rules   Hiroaki Shigeta, Chairman of Pharmaceuticals Committee,European Business Community   I would like to wish PHARMA JAPAN and all its readers a veryhappy and prosperous new year.   In my last year's message, I spoke highly of the creation ofIhoshin (Council on Medical Insurance) and expressed my hopethat through this committee the pharmaceutical industry wouldactively participate in important policy debates on health careissues.  As it turned out, while Ihoshin was slow getting itselfstarted, Chuikyo's (the Central Social Insurance MedicalCouncil) subcommittee took on the initiative and came up withthe now famous Ronten memo (Chuikyo Memorandum).  Althoughhealth care issues were, and are, wide-ranging, the subcommitteefocused solely on issues surrounding drug remuneration.Chuikyo's intent to make debates more transparent and to involvethe pharmaceutical industry in discussions by organizing twohearings was well appreciated.  Nonetheless, the end results asexpressed in Kengisho (Chuikyo Recommendation) finalized onNovember 22 of last year contain measures potentiallydevastating to the industry.   While new product pricing procedures offer incentives forR&D-based companies to further strive for breakthrough andinnovative drugs, repricing rules would dampen and underminecompanies' efforts to bring to the market and actively engage ininformation activity on innovative products.  Although decisionson repricing of products listed in the NHI for a long time hasbeen postponed for 1997, we should continue to oppose uniformpricing of branded and generic products.  In this respect, Ijoin my colleagues from PhRMA, PMS, and JPMA in insisting thatthe industry must be represented in future discussions ofChuikyo on this last issue.  It is also a good place toemphasize once more that we, the industry, should be invited asrepresentatives in future health care debates by Chuikyo.   For 1996, EBC-PC would continue to work closely with JPMA,PhRMA, and PMS to monitor the implementation of Kengisho rulesparticularly as they pertain to new product pricing.  We wouldlike to be a partner in the discussion of the long-term listingissue with the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Chuikyo.  Wewould like to look closely at the impact of other measures suchas expansions of lump-sum payment.   Starting in 1996, EBC-PC would like to take concrete steps tofurther strengthen our ties with EFPIA and Interpharma.Although we have been working closely together on selectiveissues, the relationship should be even closer and moreprofessional as European health care issues are becoming morerelevant to us here in Japan.   Once again, a Happy 1996.Des: ZHB10/ZNJ50/ZNJ66/XAN00Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 19961996 Will Be a Year of Implementation   R. D. Fluss, Chairman, Pharmaceutical ManufacturersSubcommittee of the Trade Expansion Committee, The AmericanChamber of Commerce in Japan   Looking back, 1995 was a very significant year in manyrespects.  More proposed changes and new policies in thehealthcare system were discussed and debated than in any otherrecent time.  The focus of the proposals was cost containment --more narrowly, pharmaceutical cost containment -- but theeffects may be broader.  One of our concerns was that thebroader issues were not well defined or discussed in spite ofour efforts to bring them into the debate.  Issues such asquality of care, maintaining appropriate incentives to fundinnovative research, measures which appear to save costs in theshort term but may only shift costs to other parts of thehealthcare system were not thoroughly discussed or analyzed.But they were raised and we in the industry are hopeful thatfurther input and discussion will result in rational, effectivenew policies which will achieve the desired objectives.   The past year had several positive, unanticipated benefits.Nothing promotes cooperation like a common concern.  As the newpolicies and rules evolved, the European, Japanese, and Americanpharmaceutical associations came together, worked harder andmore cooperatively than at any other time during my experiencein Japan.  When the three Ronten memos (Chuikyo Memorandum) weremade public and we realized the number and scope of theproposals being discussed in the Chuikyo (the Central SocialInsurance Medical Council) Subcommittee, we immediatelyredoubled our efforts to work together in a constructive,positive way.  Additionally, our input and interaction withChuikyo and the Ministry of Health and Welfare took on a newintensity.  Long arguing for a "seat at the table" to discusshealthcare issues with Chuikyo, we nevertheless still came upshort of full membership and participation in the process.  Butwe were invited in to give our views.  Better to be in thehearing room than out in the hallway, but still not as good asbeing on the committee.  As for our relationship with and accessto the Ministry of Health and Welfare officials, it has been andremains very satisfactory.   Looking ahead, 1996 will be a year of implementation.  Wewill see how the new policies and rules will be applied and worktheir way through the system.  We will watch closely to see ifthe intended results are occurring.  And we will continue toargue that the solution to rising healthcare costs is not soeasy or simplistic as merely holding down or decreasing the costof just one component of a complex and interrelated system.Controlling costs while maintaining a high quality, full-accesshealthcare system, with a robust, innovative pharmaceuticalindustry, and economically sound hospitals, physicians,pharmacists, and other healthcare providers may appear to bedifficult to accomplish.  But that is, or should be, the goal.My colleagues and I in the pharmaceutical industry are committedto continue to work together and with the Ministry of Health andWelfare and f to achieve it.   I wish you all a successful and happy new year.Des: ZHB00/ZNJ50/XAN00Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996It's Tough to Be Optimistic   --P. Reed Maurer, President, Nippon Pharma Promotion KK   Chicken Little attracted a large following because of a fourword statement he told everyone he met on the road to see theking.  "The sky is falling," he said repeatedly.  Others joinedin the chorus without looking up to confirm if Chicken Littlewas right or wrong.   The pharmaceutical industry enters 1996 with a fear the skyis falling.  The Chuikyo (the Central Social Insurance MedicalCouncil) deliberations do not make sense, even to those patientsouls who honestly try to understand.  Progress towardtransparency is set back by those who prefer cutting deals in aprivate room.  Rational pricing is threatened by arbitrarydecisions to balance the demands of the Ministry of Finance andthe Japan Medical Association.   The Ministry of Health and Welfare once led the developedworld's regulatory agencies in terms of review time.  While ittook the FDA 32 months to approve an NDA, the Ministry of Healthand Welfare did the job in 18 months.  Then came sorivudine andHIV contaminated blood.  Now the Ministry of Health and Welfarespends its time forcing companies to hold press conferences toannounce product recalls.  NDA approval times are gettinglonger, more silly questions are asked, while officials professtheir commitment to innovation.   Good men with vision inside companies at all levels arefrustrated and stalemated by those who are comfortable with whatworked yesterday.  They believe cutting expenses is a creativestrategy.   Generics, that is, old technology gets good press and theenergy of more people than research leads with the promise tocure a disease rather than treat its symptoms.   The JMA concocts dubious economic arguments to prove theydeserve more money while the entire country is deflating.  Likemodern Robin Hoods they would take from the rich, undeservingdrug companies to give to the poor, suffering doctors.   Pharmacists want to be respected, but run for regulated coverwhen efficient chain store operators encroach on theirterritory.  Resale price maintenance and pharmacists more adeptat selling tissue paper than drugs are to be protected at allcosts.   It's tough to be optimistic when there are so many prophetsof doom telling us the sky is falling.  The pharmaceuticalindustry will be dealt a knockout blow by Chuikyo.  The Ministryof Health and Welfare will bend everyone to their will and runthe show in an arbitrary, nontransparent manner; men of visionwill be suppressed or sent home; generics will take over theworld; and doctors will give their BMW's better care than theirpatients.   Chicken Little's merry band of pessimists were eaten by anoptimistic fox who understood the reality of the situation.1996 will be a good year to understand the difference betweenwhat is talked about and what is actually done.   Best wishes for a healthy, optimistic New Year.Des: ZHB00/ZNJ50/XAN00/XAL00Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 19961995: A Year of Negative Progress in Europe? - PART I   --Donald Macarthur, Pharmaceutical Writer & Consultant   Last year will be remembered in Europe as the year of themega-mergers among pharmaceutical companies and particularly forthe fear these evoked among thousands of ordinary employees.Boots, Glaxo, Pharmacia, Marion Merrell Dow, Fisons, BASF,Wellcome, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Upjohn, or Hoechst.  It didn'tmatter if you worked for the acquirer or the acquired, or forone of the rumored targets, unless you were a shareholder, muchof 1995 was an uncomfortable time.   In the past two years alone there have been around $70billion worth of mergers and acquisitions in an industry with ayearly turnover of just $200 billion.  Many of the earlier dealshave hitherto impacted the American market, where new healthcaremanagement systems and more demanding payers have obliged theindustry to restructure.  By comparison, the environment inEurope has probably eased if anything after the cost containmentcrises of 1992, but this did not deter the deal makers.  As anarticle in Time Magazine aptly put it: "Pharmaceuticalmanufacturers regularly caution their customers about mixingmedicines, but when it comes to combining with each other, theyappear to have thrown caution to the wind".   The rationale for the consolidation we have seen trips easilyoff the financial advisor's tongue: "more market power...widergeographical spread...higher global ranking...an opportunity toimprove margins...to spread the cost and risk of R&D...torationalize capital investment...achieve synergies...poolresources," and so on.  All this is true, of course, but thereare downsides.  For a start, there is no evidence with theindustry's core activity -- its only justification for existence   innovative new product research, that bigger equates withbetter.  Just the opposite.  Adding layers of complexity andbureaucracy, and having a less interactive atmosphere may act asa disincentive to creative individuals.  Even companies from thesame county often have totally different ways of doing thingsand it can take decades to re-establish a single new companyculture.  There is also a tremendous human cost because nosavings can be achieved without making some good peopleredundant.   It is well known that concerns over the human facet of M&Arather than its financial consequences have kept Japanese firmsmere bit players in this particular game, both at home andoverseas.  They believe a company, with its tightly knit culturecarefully nurtured by management, is an extended family to whicheach member should make a life-long commitment.  Consequently,the idea of buying and selling what is in effect people, andtrying to blend two unique corporate cultures together isdistasteful.  In particular, they recognize that patents andtrade marks are not the industry's most valuable forms ofintellectual property, rather it is their employees, andespecially in their scientists that the future lies.   Last year I read in a contributed article to PHARMA JAPAN ofthe lament of an imaginary Dr. Suzuki.  He had run a 15-man R&Dproject team in the Japanese subsidiary of a European companyfor six years when head office abruptly decided to terminate hisproject.  Suzuki may be a pseudonym used to protect his identityor pure fiction, I have no way of knowing, but the story lineturned into reality for me soon afterwards.   A leading multinational announced that one of its discoveryresearch centers near my home was to close.  Though small, thiscenter had discovered a number of important new drugs includingone which is still among the global top-10 by sales.  Even moreremarkably, it could even lay claim, if not as the actualbirthplace of antibiotics, then as the place where they spenttheir formative years, for it was here that the structure of the6-APA nucleus was elucidated.  Its microbiologists and chemistswere not content to dwell on past glories.  A number ofpromising leads in new areas were under investigation, but post-merger rationalization was demanded and so it had to go.  Sixtyof the 140 staff were offered an alternative US posting, but atleast three -- with 42 years' loyal service between them --declined to go.  I know this because each applied for a part-time editorial position in my new publishing company.   Readers will feel, and rightly so, that this scenario couldnot happen in Japan.  However, it serves to illustrate theinternational dimension to pharmaceutical research today, inwhich Japanese companies are increasingly participating.  Atripolor structure -- based on the US, Europe, and Japan -- isnow the norm for all the major players, regardless of where theyoriginate.  To my mind, a short article, also from PHARMA JAPANand coincidentally just a month prior to the Suzuki story, showsthat mistreatment of research personnel is no respecter ofnationality.  A Japanese company, the report said, was going toput in place "a flexible employment policy" for R&D overseas,including the use of annual contracts, rather than the moresecure conditions enjoyed by equivalent staff at home.  It willbe interesting to see over time how productive this overseasresearch center will be.   Management of non-Japanese has always been Japaneseindustry's Achilles heel.  One of the reasons that there has notbeen an overseas acquisition or joint venture of note since 1992is the problem seen from the Japanese side of bringing outsidersin, and coping with their very different ways of working, needs,and aspirations.  Though painfully slow, the issue may becircumnavigated, or at least postponed, by putting ex-patriatestaff in place instead.  Once a decision to globalize researchis made, however, this option is not available; otherwise thewhole point of doing R&D overseas and tapping into the localresearch culture is lost.  To make matters worse, the brightestand most original researchers are also very likely to be thepeople most difficult to man-manage.  Dropping this "us" and"them" attitude would be a start.   After all, if nothing else, the mergers are creating one ofthe most international of all industries, where the term"foreign" has no place.  The big players are not only becomingbigger, they are becoming stateless too.  Jan Leschly, CEO ofSmithKline Beecham, personifies the trend.  He grew up and waseducated in Denmark, has spent most of his career with companiesin the US, and now heads a British-registered one.  SB, likeseveral other leading European-origin companies, already earnthe majority of their profits in the US, and a few -- such asBoehringer Ingelheim, Pharmacia, and Novo Nordisk -- boast Japanas their number-one single market for sales.   Even before Upjohn, Pharmacia had experienced an unbelievable13 mergers over a few short years.  When the latest tie-up isfinalized, the US-Swedish-Italian company will have itscorporate base in London, with the CEO an American and thechairman a Swede.  Ivax of the US and Norway's Nycomed have alsochosen London to plan the globalization of their combinedgenerics businesses, already large through previousinternational M&As, but now the undisputed leader in the world.Even wholesalers are following the trend.  Germany's Gehefollowed its earlier buy-out of France's OCP with theacquisition of AAH from the United Kingdom last year.Headquarters of the wholesaling division -- larger in turnoverthan any in the US and with activities in nine west and eastEuropean countries -- is in Paris, not Gehe's Stuttgart base.   Apart from the mergers, the big issue in 1995 in Europe wasactually a series of non-events.  Attempts across a number ofcountries to introduce US-style managed care initiatives --PBMs, mail order, and disease management -- all ran intodifficulties.  In short, the natives were not sufficientlyimpressed by what they heard from across the Atlantic tointroduce privatized concepts into long-established socialsolidarity systems which, although creaking somewhat, stillfunction reasonably well.  Europe is not too proud toexperiment, though, and pilot managed care schemes will appearsoon, though these may not look much like the US model.   Managed care and mergers may have been over-hyped byconsultancies and brokers with vested interests, but radicalmeasures are needed at a time of tremendous change, it isargued.  I believe "change" is a very overused word.  Theindustry is certainly changing but the environment in which itworks, in Europe anyway, is moving at a far slower rate.  Italymay have experienced 30 different decrees modifying the patientco-payment rate over the same time period Japan has merely beendiscussing the possibility of change, but this is normal in acountry which has had 54 prime ministers in 50 years.Politicians in Germany may argue endlessly and in the fullpublic gaze about healthcare reform, but this style and thehabit of frequent recourse to the courts is how the Germansystem has always worked.Des: ZHB00/ZNJ50Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 19961995: A Year of Negative Progress in Europe? - PART II   Meanwhile, most Japanese companies -- the very descriptiononly serves to emphasize their lack of overseas market presence   continue with their long-established policy of "wait andsee."  Western boldness, Japanese caution.  Who is right?  Onlytime will tell.  Mergers and vertical integration into diseasemanagement are the current fashions, but these may not last.While the pain is clear to see, the benefits for the businesshave yet to be realized.  They may never be and the craze in thenext decade could be for de-mergers and a refocus on R&D.Wouldn't Japanese companies, whether by design or default, thenhave a head's start?

The agreement gives Kissei exclusive rights todevelop and market the angina pectoris drug in the Asian regionincluding Japan.

This new joint venture,to be called Fisher Scientific Japan, will be headed by TakaakiMatsutani, vice-president of Toho.  An authorized capital of 40million yen will be earmarked for the establishment of the newcompany (paid-in capital: 10 million yen).  The share capitalinvestment ratio will be 1:1.  The new company will undertakethe marketing of Fisher's physico-chemical products, notablysolvents, reagents, and glass products, through Toho'snationwide sales and distribution network.  Toho welcomes thejoint venture as "another milestone in the 47-year-old company'sdevelopment as a total health care enterprise."   Fisher Scientific Worldwide is a subsidiary of FisherScientific International Inc (manufacturer and marketer ofgeneral scientific and experimental products).  It wasestablished in 1992 as an export-based sales company.  It hadsales of 153 billion yen in 1995 and expects sales for 1996 toreach 240 billion yen.Des: ZHB00/ZHC00/ZNJ53/ZRA00Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Lump-sum Bulk-buying Blocks Growth of Generics, Says Mr.Matsutani   In an interview with PHARMA JAPAN on December 15, TakaakiMatsutani, vice-president of Toho Pharmaceutical, a leading drugwholesaler in Japan, stated that his company may take a positivestance toward dealing with generics in the future, saying:"Since wholesalers cannot obtain profit in the hospital marketat present, they may consider marketing generics to successfullycarry out price negotiations."  At present, wholesalers promotegenerics almost entirely to GPs, and hospitals which haveintroduced the flat-sum reimbursement system.  Mr. Matsutanihopes that wholesalers can obtain profit by presenting prices ofindividual products, including generics, on the hospital market,where wholesalers obtain no profit from branded products due tolump-sum bulk-buying.  "For this purpose, however, it isnecessary for generic manufacturers to establish closerelationships with major hospitals and persuade hospital doctorsand managers that their products are reliable," he said.   Mr. Matsutani was rather pessimistic about the growth ofgenerics in the short-run, saying: "Sales of generics wereexpected to increase in hospitals which introduced the flat-sumreimbursement system, but these hospitals continue to use brand-name products, although their consumption has decreased.  Inaddition, generics are switched to brand-name products bypharmacies when hospitals which use generics introduce thebungyo system.  I believe that sales of generics will increaseonly if patients' out-of-pocket payment for healthcare costs isincreased and the use of generics directly profits patients.  Idon't believe that the market for generics will significantlyincrease under the current healthcare system in Japan.  In thelonger run, however, generics from reliable research-orientedcompanies and companies with worldwide marketing networks, whichcan assume great responsibilities and deal with the ProductLiability Law, may achieve rapid growth."  In Mr. Matsutani'sopinion, lump-sum bulk-buying is a major stumbling block to thegrowth of generics.  "When major drug distribution systemreforms were carried out in 1992, I hoped that it would enablewholesalers to present prices of both brand-name products andgenerics to hospitals.  Four years after that reform, however, Irealize that nothing has changed," he said.Des: ZHZ20/ZHB00/ZNJ81Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996RPR Gencell Plans Gene Therapy Trials in Japan   At a press interview in Tokyo on December 12, ThierrySoursac, general manager of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) Gencell,said that his company's R&D efforts are focused on (1)development of drugs for gene therapy (in-vivo therapy) and (2)cell treatment in cell processing centers (extracorporealtherapy).  The company plans to start the gene therapy businesson a commercial basis in 1999, and hopes to reach the break-evenpoint by the year 2005.  He said that the company is beingefficiently operated with 60% of R&D investment going towardmalignant tumors and 20% for vascular restenosis andarteriosclerosis.  Clinical studies have already begun in theUnited States on 10 products related to gene therapy includingthe P53 retrovirus, and five cell therapy-related productsincluding CD5/8.   Kensuke Tomita, the general manager of RPR Gencell for theAsia-Pacific region, said in the same interview that multipleclinical studies in the gene therapy field will also be startedin Japan.  Although he did not name the research institutions orcompanies which will participate in these studies, he said thatthis is being worked out at present so that the first projectcan begin as soon as possible.  Mr. Soursac has surveyed theJapanese market and he feels that only a few researchinstitutions can participate in such projects at present, butopportunities for research in this field are increasing with thestart of collaborative studies on gene therapy in theindustrial, governmental, and academic sectors by the Ministryof Health and Welfare and the Ministry of International Tradeand Industry (MITI), and he expects that this business willexpand in the future with the cooperation of Japanese partners.Des: ZHB00/ZNJ58/ZNJ51/ZIA10Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Eli Lilly Japan, Chugai to Co-market and Develop Raloxifene   Bryce D. Carmine, president of Eli Lilly Japan KK, and OsamuNagayama, president of Chugai Pharmaceutical, announced at ajoint press conference on December 13 that they have enteredinto a collaborative agreement to co-develop and co-marketraloxifene, new osteoporosis treatment Lilly is developing, inJapan.  Raloxifene is a new class of drug called selectiveestrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  In describing the agreementMr. Carmine said, "Lilly's experience in developing raloxifenein the United States and Europe combined with Chugai's extensivedevelopment and marketing expertise in osteoporosis in Japanwill allow raloxifene to be developed more quickly andextensively, thereby bringing improved health benefits toJapanese patients at an earlier date."  For Chugai's part Mr.Nagayama said the agreement "is congruent with our strategies,"adding that having an integrated team from the two firms willadvance R&D more quickly.  In Japan the drug is currently inPhase II.   Eli Lilly developed raloxifene in the US and the drug hasstarted clinical trials in Europe.  The drug selectively bindsto estrogen receptors exhibiting estrogen-like effects in boneand lipid metabolism while blocking the effects of estrogen onthe uterus and breast.  Thus the drug overcomes the undesirablehemorrhaging side effects of current estrogen drugs.  Inaddition, with regard to the risk of developing uterine orbreast cancer, Mr. Carmine said that clinical trials in the USand Europe have confirmed its safety.   For the Japanese clinical trials, the two companies under theterms of the agreement will share R&D costs equally and for thetime being Eli Lilly Japan and Chugai will jointly carry outlate Phase II trials.  The effort also involves cooperation withthe Eli Lilly development team of the US and the companiesexpect to apply for approval to manufacture the drug in Japanwithin three or four years.Des: ZHB10/ZHB20/ZNJ54/YCA04Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Drug Wholesalers' Sales/Gross Profit Ratio Hits 11% for FirstTime   The Federation of Japan Pharmaceutical Wholesalers'Associations announced on December 7 its summary of businessconditions in the drug wholesale industry for 1995.  Takentogether with the industry's performance in 1994, sales on aweighted-average basis recorded a year-on-year rise of 4.89%,while the sales/gross profits ratio dropped 0.72 percentagepoints, to 11.44%, reflecting the trend towards decliningprofitability among wholesalers in the aftermath of the secondround of reforms in drug distribution.  The Business ManagementCommittee surveyed FJPWA members as of May 18 this year, on the77 firms that closed the books on March 31, 1995 out of the 122firms responding.  On a sales weighted basis, it covered 90% ofthe market.  On the same day, the federation announced that forthe half-year results at 41 leading wholesalers with a financialyear ending March 31, 1996, operating profits declined 7.6% with2.1% lower net profits on an overall 4% increase in sales.   Ken Suzuki, chairman of the committee (and managing directorof Nichiei), expressed concern that the sales/gross profitsratio had fallen to the 11% level for the first time since thesurveys started.  As one of the causes of the performance hecited manufacturers invoice prices.  In the previous round ofNHI drug price revision, the drug price was down 7% whilewholesalers' actual sales prices declined 5%, reducing the drugprice discrepancy to 2%.  However, because the invoice price wasnot discounted by 4%, a 1% gap surfaced leading to theconclusion that this caused the sales/gross profits ratio todrop.  In addition to this, he explained that even thoughwholesalers were able to shrink the ratio of expenses to cash onhand by 0.25 points, they were still pursued by decliningprofits.  The results of the survey showed that although firmsmade efforts to boost efficiency by raising productivity ofmarketing specialists and reducing products carried, as well asshrinking the number of months of trade receivables, thesemeasures were insufficient to cover the rapid decline inprofitability.  With regard to future conditions, Mr. Suzukisaid that from the tendencies up to now, it is apparent that thesales/gross profits ratio will decline even further.  Thus thequestion is to what extent expenses can be lowered.  He stressedthe importance of cutting expenses further.Des: ZHB10/ZNJ81/ZNJ10/ZRA00Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Nippon Kayaku: 1995 Forecast Revised Upwards   Nippon Kayaku on December 8 announced an upward revision toits projections for the 1995 business year ending on May 31,1996.  The initial forecast called for lower profits on slightlyhigher sales for the semiannual and the annual settlement terms.However, for the half-year term the company achieved ordinaryprofits of 3,500 million yen and net profits of 1,400 millionyen on sales of 53,000 million yen, all improvements over theinitial projections.  While sales for the year are expected tobe the same as the original forecast, ordinary profits look setto reach 7,800 million yen with net profits of 3,400 millionyen, both upward revisions.  According to Nippon Kayaku, thefirm attributes the improved performance to better than expectedgrowth of new products as the sales ratio of the domesticpharmaceutical division was relatively high, cost ratiosimproved due to the high yen, and sales and administrative costswere reduced.  As a result of these factors, the company saw itsprofits rise.  With the higher interim profits, the results forthe year seem assured.Des: ZHB10/ZNJ10Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Issues in Focus (31)   Blood Coagulation Factor Products and HIV Infection   Although litigation over HIV infections from unheated bloodcoagulation factor products is moving toward a settlement on theadvice of the courts, the affected patients are not satisfiedwithout an apology from the government.  In addition, new casesnot limited to the known cases of hemophiliac patients areappearing which is leading to growing confusion.   In the Diet, especially in the Committee on Health andWelfare, there are discussions almost daily on the HIV infectionincident.  One of the focal points of the issue is the approvalof heat-treated products in 1985 and why it was not possible toapprove the products earlier.  Approval of heat-treated productscame a year and a half after approval in the US and in themeantime Japan continued to import and use products that werenot treated with heat, which spread the infection.   The Ministry of Health and Welfare's response, even at thattime, was not as slow to react to such cases as the mediaclaimed, having gained experience with the thalidomide andchinoform incidents.  Thus in the Diet discussions, the Ministryof Health and Welfare insisted that it has always respondedswiftly.   At the time the infections occurred, there was nothingunusual in the two-year plus period normally required for drugsto go through the approval process.  The length of reviews inJapan was a source of trade friction with the US, so in 1987,the Ministry of Health and Welfare proposed new standard reviewperiods (a year and a half for new drugs) for approval.  In theministry's view it responded quickly, although this didn't washwith the public and it came in for criticism for its tardyresponse.   Apart from time lags of approval, the cause of the tragedymay be identified in "perception gaps" between the Ministry ofHealth and Welfare and healthcare providers.   First of all, at least as early as 1985, most people believedthat AIDS was an infectious disease limited to a certain high-risk group and through the experience with the Japanese bloodcollection system, Japanese experts did not feel that bloodsupplies from the US were extensively infected with the HIVvirus.  Furthermore, it was widely know that the HIV virus isonly weakly contagious.  Thus members of the CPAC (CentralPharmaceutical Affairs Council) were not very concerned.   One newspaper pointed out that the Japanese government shouldhave ordered importers of unheated blood coagulation factorproducts to recall their products immediately after the approvalof heated products.  However, neither did the US governmentorder producers of unheated products to recall them at the earlystages of the tragedy and the US ordered the recall at almostthe same time as Japan did.  In this sense, the US awareness ofthe risk may be similar to that of Japan.   In the second place, pharmacologists feared that heatingfresh blood products might cause the components to becomedenatured and could result in side-effect cases.  Thus theydecided to conduct a careful review of heated versions of thebiological products, which have always received careful scrutinyof quality specifications and for toxicity because of the natureof the product.   There is no effective drug for hemophiliacs other than bloodcoagulation factor.  At the time the Ministry of Health andWelfare was more concerned about the safety of the heatedproduct than the risk of AIDS.  This reaction was quite naturalin view of the government's stance toward drug approval, but itwas precisely because the review was conducted so carefully thatthe tragedy developed.   The case of heated versions of blood coagulation factor showsthat in a drug that involves high public risk, the decisionmakers should make a quick and sometimes risky decision, as awoman reviewer in the FDA did to minimize the impact of thethalidomide incident.Des: ZHB00/ZHZ30/XAN00/ZRG50/XEA09/YCA04Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996JPA Calls for New Pharmacist Working Efficiencies   The Japan Pharmaceutical Association's 28th Congress ofPharmaceutical Sciences convened for two days on December 9 and10 in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture.   Commenting on the current situation surrounding pharmacists,Tasuku Yoshiya, president of the JPA expressed his feeling thatthe industry has come to a point where all the unsolved issuessince the pharmacist system was established a century ago areemerging.  He said: "The proposals for reforming pharmacologyeducation are bogged down in the Ministry of Education, Culture,and Science.  As for the progress in bungyo (separation ofprescribing and dispensing functions), a higher priority hasbeen given to eliminating inappropriate forms of bungyo.  Thereis also a possibility that the government can deregulate thetypes of operations that can sell drugs.  All these factorswould require pharmacists with even wider and deeper knowledgewith heavier responsibilities.  Our association would like toexplore and establish new functions for pharmacists that canfill the requirements of the coming century."   Reorganize Dispensing Fee Structures for Complete Bungyo   Speaking before the Japan Pharmaceutical Association'ssubcommittee on social insurance, JPA Executive Director YasujiAkiba expressed his view that the next revision of dispensingfees would primarily involve changing the fee structure amongdifferent types of pharmacies and allocating lower fees forsecnd pharmacies (monzen yakkyoku).  He said "Issues includingmedical treatment and separation of prescribing and dispensingfunctions are not easily understood by the general public.  Thisis especially true when these issues are combined with thefinancial system.  In order to attain self-evident fairness,second pharmacies should at least be given lower dispensing feesthan other types of outside pharmacies.  This means that inorder to attain complete bungyo, the structure of dispensingfees among different types of pharmacies should be reorganized,or else the bungyo project will fail.  After the next revisionof dispensing fees, some pharmacies would gain morereimbursement points while some other such as the monzenyakkyoku would be given fewer points."   Progress in Medical Team Cooperation   Speaking in a symposium titled "Stepping Up to PharmaceuticalCare -- Cooperating with the Medical Team" in the subcommitteeon drugs for women, Fumikazu Takeda, president of the SaitamaCancer Center, stressed the effectiveness of pain control,especially in the use of morphine, in view of world trends forimproving cancer patients' quality of life.  He cautioned thatthese drugs should be carefully used, taking into considerationsuch factors as types and characteristics of pain, dosages,time, and preventing side effects.  He foresees a greater rolefor pharmacists in providing pain control care.  He alsoexpressed his view that when pain control care is fullyimplemented there will be no need for euthanasia legislation.   Interim Report on Pharmacy Grand Design   The Japan Pharmaceutical Association on December 9 submittedan interim report entitled "Pharmacy Grand Design," whichdescribes the policy of the organization now being developed, toa joint subcommittee surveying pharmacies and the economies ofthe pharmaceutical industry.  The policy describes what rolespharmacies should play in the year 2005.  The Grand Designdescribes 16 policies to reach the objective, including thefollowing nine: (1) rationalization of the scale anddistribution of pharmacies; (2) 24-hour pharmacy operation andstand-by system; (3) rationalization of the supply system; (4)public service security; (5) improving the quality ofpharmacists; (6) implementation of pharmaceutical care; (7)constructing a drug information support system; (8) drug useevaluation; and (9) a pharmaceutical quality assurance system.   According to the report, the number of pharmacies that willbe needed by 2005 is 20,000 with some 70,000 pharmacists.  Thenumber of legal prescriptions issued is expected to total 700million, with the ratio of patients who actually receiveprescriptions to be filled by outside pharmacies estimated to be48%.  This means that one pharmacist would fill around 10,000prescriptions a year.  By 2005, the number of drug storepharmacists would need to increase by 3,000 every year.  Basedon this projection, the number of pharmacies required to fillprescriptions by the time bungyo is fully established would be24,000, with 96,000 pharmacists filling one billionprescriptions.  Seen in this perspective, 24,000 is equivalentto the current number of elementary schools or post offices inJapan.   For specific economic indicators, the report cites annualsales of 160 million yen per pharmacy in 2005 which breaks downto 125 million yen, or 78%, for filling prescriptions and 35million yen, or 22%, for OTC drug sales.  A pharmacy would fill35,000 prescriptions per year, or 120 a day, on average witheach prescription worth about 3,600 yen.  The minimum staffrequired by a pharmacy would be three full-time pharmacists, onepart-time pharmacist, and two other store employees.  Atpresent, 60% of JPA members only have one pharmacist.  It isunlikely that Japanese pharmacies will meet the objective ofattaining this number unless they take drastic measures over thenext ten years.Des: ZHB10/ZHB30/ZNJ61/ZHC00/XAM00Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Domestic Drug Production Up 1.0%, Imports Down 2.3%   The Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau released statistical dataon November 30 on trends in pharmaceutical industry productionfor fiscal 1994.

This request includes calls for a change from the currentfive component classification to a three componentclassification: substances used exclusively as drugs, substancesused as food, and substances used as both food and drugs.  Sincethere are forms such as powders and granules used for both foodsand drugs, and it is difficult to differentiate between foodsand drugs by form, the request calls for optional use with nodifferentiation from drugs.  Concerning the labeling of foodeffects, the request states that in recent years in both Japanand the other industrialized countries, food has been eaten withconsideration given to prevention and improvements of diseases,as well as improvements in the structure and functions of thebody, and it is not appropriate to consider such matters as therole of drugs alone.  In the near future, the law should berevised to permit the labeling of food effects such as labelingwith an emphasis on health.Des: ZHB60/ZHH40/XAN00/ZHZ40Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Infectious Disease Reports Say Influenza Subsiding   The Statistics and Information Department of the Minister'sSecretariat recently released the 1994 statistics on infectiousdiseases.  According to the statistics, cases of infectiousdiseases are generally declining.  While influenza, measles,whooping cough and other infectious diseases still run theircourses, the number of reported cases continues to decline.   Physicians who diagnose an infectious disease are obliged toreport it to a health center in their jurisdiction.  Thedepartment's survey was compiled based on such reports.  In 1994the number of influenza outbreaks reported was 2,404, a drasticreduction compared to the 16,555 reported in 1993.  By contrast,the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Infectious Disease ControlDivision reports that there were 108,564 influenza-type cases.The department's survey was calculated on the basis of thenumber of cases reported to health centers on a fixed number ofhospitals in their jurisdiction.  When looking at the number ofcases for the same sort of reports over the past three years,the statistics for infectious diseases were 5,868 cases in 1991;6,053 in 1992; and 16,655 in 1993, while the Infectious DiseaseControl Division's survey reported 258,172; 336,316; and 636,534for the same years, indicating a huge gap.  This is attributedto advances in medical technology that have made it easier totreat influenza and a decline in the feeling of obligation toreport on the part of doctors.   In addition, the number of cases of infectious diseases,which had exceeded 10,000 during the first half of 1995,steadily declined, stopping with a total of 145 and 1,766reported cases for whooping cough and measles, respectively.For the population under 15 years of age the morbidity ratio byage was highest for whooping cough between infancy and 2 yearsand for measles at one year of age.Des: ZHB00/ZHZ00/XAN00/ZRA00Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Most of 5,448 Quake Fatalities Sudden Deaths   The Statistics and Information Department of the Minister'sSecretariat of the Ministry of Health and Welfare recentlyreleased vital statistics on fatalities from the Great HanshinEarthquake.  According to a survey of vital statistics therewere 5,448 fatalities, with one and a half times as many deathsamong women as of men and twice as many deaths among those over65 compared to deaths among men.  More than 80% of the deathsoccurred on the morning the earthquake struck on January 17;over 70% died from asphyxiation or from being crushed.  Aspreviously indicated, most of the deaths were instantaneous.   The survey compiled the figures from obituary notices anddeath certificates issued between January and June this year bymunicipalities.  By sex, the number of deaths stood at 2,211males (40.3% of the total) and 3,277 women (59.7%).  The highestnumber of deaths occurred in the male 60- to 64-year old agegroup, with 223 deaths.  Among the elderly, most of the 370deaths occurred among women between the ages of 70 and 74.Among the younger generations there were 297 fatalities in the20-24 age group, most of whom are presumed to have beenresidential students.  The top cause of death was asphyxiationand crushing, accounting for 4,224 (77.0%) of the fatalities,followed by 504 deaths from fire or from burn injuries (9.2%).Asphyxiation and crushing accounted for the overwhelming share,although fatalities among those over 65 bore the largest shareof any age group of deaths by burning or from burn injuries.There were also 15 fatalities due to crush syndrome, of whom 12died more than three days after the quake.

"Weexpect annual sales of 60-80 billion yen worldwide for each ofthese products.  Coupled with sales of our existing in-housedrugs, Leuplin (leuprolide) and Takepron (lansoprazole),overseas sales of our in-house products will account for morethan 50% of their total sales by the year 2000," he said.  Healso expressed great hope for overseas sales of Avan(idebenone), a cerebral metabolism improver, mentioning that itmay be introduced into other countries, although he did notindicate when an NDA would be filed.  Avan is currently Takeda'sbest-selling product.  "A phase III trial has been completed inEurope.  I am confident that we will be able to achieve goodsales when it is launched, because it was found to besignificantly more effective than a placebo in patients withAlzheimer's type dementia in our phase III trial," he said.   "TCV-116 is expected to be the second angiotensin II receptorantagonist, following Merck's losartan, but I believe we will bein a fairly advantageous position in terms of price due to thelower dosage of our compound.  We may be able to launch AD-4833in different countries earlier than we expected," Mr. Fujinosaid, showing great hopes for these products on the worldmarket.  New compounds to follow them include an eosinophilinfiltration inhibitor which is expected to be effective forasthma, and AK-603, an anti-RA drug.  The former is expected toenter phase I next year, while preparations for a phase II studyare underway for the latter.  "Sales of Avan in Japan aredeclining, but I am optimistic they will hit bottom at about 25billion yen, and it will remain one of our leading products.  Inorder to deal with its re-evaluation, we are conducting aplacebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial," he said.Des: ZHB00/ZNJ00/ZNJ51Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996Fractures as Endpoint for Osteoporosis Need Further Debate   At a seminar held by the Japan Osteoporosis Foundation onDecember 11, Hajime Orimo, director of the Tokyo Hospital of theMinistry of Finance, discussed the establishment of fracturefrequency as an endpoint in the draft guidelines on clinicaltrials of drugs to treat osteoporosis.  He noted that large-scale double-blind clinical studies are difficult to conductover long periods, and provisional approval should be givenusing bone mass as an endpoint.  He also called on the Ministryof Health and Welfare to reconsider endpoints.  Dr. Orimo saidthat the incorporation of fracture studies in the protocol forpost-marketing Phase IV studies is now under investigation, andcoordination of the approval and post-marketing stages isimportant.  He indicated that further discussions are requiredon fracture studies, and they should not be introduced inclinical evaluation guidelines at present.  In his lecture atthe seminar, Dr. Orimo estimated that prevention of fractures byhormone replenishment therapy (HRT) should reduce treatmentcosts of fractures by 31.7 billion yen annually.  He stressedthe economic effects of the prophylactic use of HRT and proposedthat HRT agents be approved as prophylactic drugs.   Dr. Orimo based his estimate of a 31.7 billion yen reductionon (1) halving of the fracture incidence by HRT according toforeign data, (2) annual treatment costs for femoral headfractures (treatment costs of about 2 million yen per case,including hospitalized cases, multiplied by the number ofpatients) of 115.8 billion yen, and (3) annual HRT costs of 26.2billion yen (about 450,000 yen a year times the number ofpatients).

Based on his experience at his hospital, hestressed that pharmacoepidemiology can play a very importantrole in collecting information necessary to properly evaluatethe efficacy and safety of drugs.  "Databases obtained bypharmacoepidemiology make it easier to test various hypothesesand to efficiently answer questions," he said.   Pointing out that data obtained from applications forreimbursement, collected for a different purpose, cannot be useto obtain information necessary for pharmacoepidemiology, hestressed the need to establish in-house databases to whichdoctors and pharmacists can have easy access any time they needinformation.  "The use of standard codes, outcome assessment,data security, and protection of patients' privacy are some ofthe factors that need to be taken into consideration whenestablishing such databases," he added.   "At Kanto Teishin Hospital, a four-year plan to establish ourown database has entered its second year.  We want to establisha fully computerized information system through the cooperationof all medical professionals at our hospital.  They are makingconcerted efforts, collecting information related to drugs'safety and efficacy, following up on patients, and conductingquestionnaire surveys on them.  In the future, we plan toconnect the pharmacoepidemiology database to the host computerused to operate our in-house ordering system in order toconstruct a total system that is more convenient for users," Mr.Oyake said.   Other lectures delivered during the seminar included one onthe basic idea and knowledge of pharmacoepidemiology byToshiharu Fujita, chief of the Environmental EpidemiologySection of the Institute of Public Health, and one on the roleof pharmacoepidemiology in the development of drugs and post-marketing surveillance by Yasuo Ohashi, professor ofEpidemiology and Biostatistics at the School of Health Sciencesand Nursing of the University of Tokyo.Des: ZHB10/ZHB20/ZHF00/ZHG00Ref: Pharma Japan, 01/01/96Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMLINE JAPAN DAILY: BIOTECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 08, 1996First JFMDTC Clinical Trial Coordinators Certified   The Japanese Foundation for Multi-Disciplinary Treatment ofCancer held the First Meeting for the Pres.entation of ClinicalTrial Facility Coordinator's Certificates, the 16th Meeting forthe Pres.entation of JFMDTC General Research Grants, and the15th Meeting for the Pres.entation of Studies Conducted UsingJFMDTC General Research Grants.

The metal ions would first bechelated, then extracted from the samples and carried through asuitable restrictor to a gas-chromatograph/mass-spectrometer (GC-MS) by using a suitable supercritical fluid.When fully developed, the method might be implemented in a field-portable apparatus for the detection and quantification of metalsin various matrices without a need for elaborate preparation ofsamples.  The apparatus could be used, for example, to analyze soilsamples for toxic metals.A GC-MS apparatus could be used to analyze samples of soil fororganic materials, but not for metals. Traditionally there was noway to extract the metals form soil samples and present the metalsto the mass spectrometer in the required gaseous form.  It would bequite cost effective if both metals and organic compounds could beanalyzed by the same technique of mass spectrometry.The key step in the proposed technique would be the chelation,which would convert the metal from an ionic form that isessentially insoluble in a typical supercritical fluid to achelated form that is soluble in a supercritical fluid.  Becausemetal chelates extracted via a supercritical fluid are effectivelyin the gaseous state, they can be introduced directly into a massspectrometer for analysis.On the basis of their demonstrated ability to form metal chelates,8-hydroxy-quinoline, acetyl acetone, dialkyldithio-carbamates, andethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) have been selected forinvestigation of their suitability as chelating agents in theproposed technique.  The investigation will also address the use oftetralkyl ammonium ions to increase the solubilities of metalcomplexes.The work was done by Mahadeva P.

There is a growinginterest in the biocatalytic synthesis of specialty polymers sincesuch an approach can generate additional properties such aschirality and biodegradability.  Biologically synthesized polymershave been applied as absorbents, biodegradable materials, chiraladsorbents, liquid crystals, and perm-selective membranes.Bayer Corp. (1 Mellon Bank Ctr., Pittsburgh, PA 15258; Tel:412/394-5500, Fax: 412/394-5534) has discovered a process for theproduction of polyesters reacting a diol with an acid or acid esterin the presence of a solid enzymes and supercritical fluids (USPatent 5,478,910).Low molecular weight linear aliphatic oligoesters that are hydroxyterminated have commercial significance for use in the manufactureof polyurethane resins. The current commercial process is based onacid/base catalyzed condensation polymerization between adiacid/diester and a diol. The use of traditional catalysts islimited because such catalysts tend to have an undesirable effecton the subsequent polyurethane synthesis.Supercritical fluids have been described as extraction solvents,have been used in various industrial extraction processes, and havebeen suggested as being useful for a variety of enzyme catalyzedreactions. With supercritical fluids as the reaction medium, enzymeenantioselectivity can be manipulated by the pressure of thesystem.In both enzymatic and non-enzyme catalyzed synthesis of oligoestersand polyesters, it is difficult to control product molecular weightin a predictable manner. All techniques described to date dependupon changing the reaction time in order to manipulate molecularweight. In the case of non-enzyme catalyzed oligo- and polyesters,the final product typically contains cyclic ester by-products andsmall amounts of residual catalyst, both of which can adverselyaffect properties of products produced from those oligo- andpolyesters.The Bayer innovation overcomes most of the above difficulties andallows for the production of a wide variety of polyesters where itis relatively simple to produce a material of a desired molecularweight by merely varying the pressure under which thepolyesterification or polytransesterification reaction isconducted.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Pesticides Removedfrom Fruits, VeggiesTwo recent publications describe the removal of pesticides fromvegetables and fruits using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).Both studies found SFE an acceptable method for the removal ofpesticides from produce for analysis.Steven J. Lehotay and Konstantin I. Eller of the BeltsvilleAgricultural Research Center of the U.S. Department of Agriculture(Environmental Chemistry Laboratory, Bldg. 7, Rm. 224, Beltsville,MD 20705-2351; Tel: 301/504-6078) developed a method for analyzingthe levels of 46 pesticides in grapes, carrots, potatoes, andbrocolli.  The multiresidue method used SFE in conjunction with gaschromatography/ion-trap mass spectrometry in order to extract andanalyze residues.The SFE was performed at 320 atm and 60oC, and the extracts weretrapped on solid-phase media.  Silica gel bound to octadecylsilanewas found suitable for this purpose.  The trap was then eluted withacetonitrile.  Next, the chromatographic analysis was performed.Greater than 80% recoveries were achieved for 39 of the 46pesticides.  The recoveries of the other pesticides, with theexception of methamidophos and omethoate, were more than 50%.Both incurred and fortified samples were used in a subsequentanalysis to evaluate the method.  The blind experiment showed thatthis method resulted in recoveries similar to results from sevenlaboratories using solvent-based extractions with traditional gas-chromatograph detectors.Lehotay tells HTSN that the focus of his work is pesticide analysisof agricultural commodities, and SFE is one of the primary methodsof extraction being developed by the laboratory.  The study waspublished as "Development of a Method of Analysis for 46 Pesticidesin Fruits and Vegetables by Supercritical Fluid Extraction and GasChromatography/Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry" in the Journal of theAssociation of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3), 821-830,1995].In a similar study, scientists in Spain used a simple SFE method toremove pesticide residues from fresh pepper, cucumber, and tomatosamples.  Under moderate conditions, commercial SFE equipmentextracted methamidophos at a level greater than 70%, as well aschlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and procymidone.The fresh samples were mixed with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.Methanol was used as a modifier for the carbon dioxide fluid.Extraction conditions were a pressure of 300 atm and a temperatureof 50C.  The authors recommend further development of this methodfor the extraction of multiple residues.A. Garcia-Valverde, A.R. Fernandez-Alba, A. Aguera, and M.Contreras of the Pesticide Residue Research Group of theUniversidad de Almeria (Facultad de Ciencias Experimentales, Spain)published "Extraction of Methamidophos Residues from Vegetableswith Supercritical Fluid Carbon Dioxide" in the Journal of theAssociation of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3), 867-873,1995].Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Synthetic ProteinsBehave Like BABSCreative BioMolecules Inc. (35 South St., Hopkinton, MA; Tel:508/435-9001) has been issued a patent for the development of afamily of synthetic proteins that have affinity for a preselectedantigen (U.S. No. 5,476,786). The Creative BioMolecules proteinsare characterized by one or more sequences of amino acidsconstituting a region that behaves as a biosynthetic antibodybinding site (BABS). The sites comprise:     non-covalently associated or disulfide bonded synthetic VH andVL dimers,     VH-VL or VL-VH single chains wherein the VH and VL areattached by a polypeptide linker, or     Individual VH or VL domains.Antibodies are proteins belonging to a group of immunoglobulinselicited by the immune system in response to a specific antigen orsubstance that the body deems foreign. Antibodies can bothrecognize and bind that antigen and are involved in a number ofeffector reactions such as complement fixation and allergicresponses.There are five classes of human antibodies that have the ability toselectively recognize and preferentially bind a specific antigen.Each antibody class has the same basic structure, or multiplesthereof, consisting of two identical polypeptides called heavy orH chains (molecular weight in IgG approximately 50,000 d each) andtwo identical polypeptides called light or L chains (molecularweight approximately 25,000 d each).Each of the five antibody classes has a similar set of light chainsand a distinct set of heavy chains. A light chain is composed ofone variable and one constant domain, while a heavy chain iscomposed of one variable and three or more constant domains. Thevariable domains determine the specificity of the immunoglobulin,and the constant regions have other functions.Amino acid sequence data indicate that each variable domaincomprises three hypervariable regions flanked by four relativelyconserved framework regions. The hypervariable regions have beenassumed to be responsible for the binding specificity of individualantibodies and to account for the diversity of binding ofantibodies as a protein class.Monoclonal antibodies, or homogeneous antibodies of identicalgenetic parentage and binding specificity, have been useful both asdiagnostic and therapeutic agents. They are routinely producedaccording to established procedures by hybridomas generated byfusion of mouse lymphoid cells with an appropriate mouse myelomacell line.Human monoclonal antibodies are difficult to produce by cell-fusiontechniques since, among other problems, human hybridomas arenotably unstable, and removal of immunized spleen cells from humansis not feasible as it is for rodents. Monoclonals, which havespecificities of significant therapeutic value, are generally ofmurine or rat origin, and are therefore immunogenic to the humanimmune system.The binding domains comprise linked CDR and FR regions, which maybe derived from separate immunoglobulins. The proteins may alsoinclude other polypeptide sequences that function as an enzyme,toxin, binding site, or site of attachment to an immobilizationmedia or radioactive atom. Methods are disclosed for producing theproteins, for designing BABS having any specificity that can beelicited by in vivo generation of antibody, and for producinganalogs thereof.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SELEX MethodPrepares LigandsLarry Gold and Diane Tasset of Nextstar Pharmaceuticals Inc.(Boulder, CO) have determined methods to identify nucleic acidligand solutions to thrombin (US Patent 5,476,766).  The inventionutilizes the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands for EXponentialenrichment) method for identifying and preparing RNA ligands tothrombin.  Included are modified nucleotide sequences based on thesequences of the RNA ligands identified. The modified RNA ligandsto thrombin exhibit increased in vivo stability.Most proteins or small molecules are not known to specifically bindto nucleic acids. The known protein exceptions are those regulatoryproteins such as repressors, polymerases, activators, and the likethat function in a living cell to bring about the transfer ofgenetic information encoded in the nucleic acids into cellularstructures and the replication of the genetic material. Smallmolecules such as GTP bind to some intron RNAs.The individual components of proteins, the 20 natural amino acids,possess sufficient chemical differences and activities to providean enormous breadth of activities for both binding and catalysis.Nucleic acids, however, are thought to have narrower chemicalpossibilities than proteins, but to have an informational role thatallows genetic information to be passed from virus to virus, cellto cell, and organism to organism. In this context nucleic acidcomponents, the nucleotides, possess only pairs of surfaces thatallow informational redundancy within a Watson-Crick base pair.Nucleic acid components need not possess chemical differences andactivities sufficient for either a wide range of binding orcatalysis.Some nucleic acids found in nature do participate in binding tocertain target molecules and even a few instances of catalysis havebeen reported. The range of activities of this kind is narrowcompared to proteins and more specifically antibodies.  Double-stranded DNA has a well-known capacity to bind within the nooks andcrannies of target proteins whose functions are directed to DNAbinding. Single-stranded DNA can also bind to some proteins withhigh affinity and specificity, although the number of examples issmaller.While not bound by a theory of preparation, systematic evolution ofligands for exponential enrichment (SELEX) is based on theinventors' insight that within a nucleic acid mixture containing alarge number of possible sequences and structures, there is a rangeof binding affinities for a given target. A nucleic acid mixturecomprising, for example, a 20 nucleotide randomized segment canhave 420 candidate possibilities. Those that have the higheraffinity constants for the target are most likely to bind.After partitioning, dissociation, and amplification, a secondnucleic acid mixture is generated, enriched for the higher bindingaffinity candidates. Additional rounds of selection progressivelyfavor the best ligands until the resulting nucleic acid mixture ispredominantly composed of only one or a few sequences. These can becloned, sequenced, and individually tested for binding affinity aspure ligands.In many cases, it is not necessarily desirable to perform theiterative steps of SELEX until a single nucleic acid ligand isidentified. The target-specific nucleic acid ligand solution mayinclude a family of nucleic acid structures or motifs that have anumber of conserved sequences and a number of sequences that can besubstituted or added without significantly effecting the affinityof the nucleic acid ligands to the target. By terminating the SELEXprocess prior to completion, it is possible to determine thesequence of a number of members of the nucleic acid ligand solutionfamily.Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease that has importantprocoagulant and anticoagulant activities. As a procoagulantenzyme, thrombin clots fibrinogen, activates clotting factors V,VIII, and XIII, and activates platelets. The specific cleavage offibrinogen by thrombin initiates the polymerization of fibrinmonomers, a primary event in blood clot formation. The centralevent in the formation of platelet thrombi is the activation ofplatelets from the "pnonbinding"n to the "sbinding"d mode, andthrombin is the most potent physiologic activator of plateletaggregation.As a procoagulant, thrombin plays a key role in the arrest ofbleeding (physiologic hemostasis) and formation of vasoocclusivethrombi (pathologic thrombosis).  The formation of the thrombin-TMcomplex converts thrombin from a procoagulant to an anticoagulantenzyme, and the normal balance between these opposing activities iscritical to the regulation of hemostasis.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Chemical SensorDetects ReactionsFisons plc (Ipswich, UK) and GEC Marfoni Ltd. (Ipswich, UK)  havedeveloped chemical sensors for detecting antibody-antigen bindingreactions (US Patent 5,478,756). The sensor is characterized inthat the surface of the piezoelectric support, including the regionbearing the electrode, is covered by a layer of dielectric materialof thickness 0.5 to 20 microns. The piezoelectric support ispreferably a single crystal. The dielectric layer may be of silicondioxide or a suitable polymer and preferably has a thickness ofbetween 0.5 and 5 microns.Antibodies are molecules that protect an organism from diseaseand/or infection. When an organism is exposed to an antigen, theorganism creates antibodies that provide binding sites to which theantigen may be bound and immobilized.Many known antibodies exist and can be used to detect specificantigens. Detection of such antigens is effected by providing theappropriate antibody and determining whether binding takes place.For example, an antibody may be provided on a surface of a support,the support may be immersed in a liquid thought to contain anantigen, and a physical characteristic of the surface and/or thesupport is monitored to determine if binding (indicative of thepresence of the antigen) has taken place.One form of support that has been used is a piezo-electric crystalin which surface acoustic waves (SAW) are generated. Binding ofantigen to antibody on the surface of the support is detected as adecrease in wave velocity.A problem that occurs with known SAW sensors is that considerablepenetration occurs if the acoustic wave into the environment is tobe sensed. If the environment is gaseous, this problem is notunduly onerous. However, if (as is usually the case for analysis ofbiologically originating samples) the environment is liquid, thenthe penetration of the wave into the environment causesconsiderable damping. This in turn reduces the sensitivity of thedevice.Devices have also been described that utilize shear horizontalwaves. These offer a number of advantages over SAW devices: 1) bulkwaves suffer lower propagation losses than SAW (under liquids); 2)bulk waves have higher velocities and can therefore be used athigher frequencies than SAW; and 3) bulk waves have superiortemperature coefficients to SAW in both quartz and LiTaO3. Thesebulk wave devices suffer from the disadvantage of a limited masssensitivity due to poor surface energy confinement.The new invention is an improved form of chemical sensor ofparticular utility in the detection and/or determination of ananalyte species in a sample that is liquid, as is generally thecase for samples of biological origin, and that overcomes orsubstantially mitigates the disadvantages associated with known SAWand bulk wave devices.  The sensor is advantageous in that thelayer of dielectric material increases the coupling coefficient andreduces the insertion loss of the wave. Also, and very importantly,the device may be totally immersed in a liquid with littleattenuation occurring in the intensity of the guided surface wave.Other advantages of the sensor according to the invention includeits relatively simple construction and the fact that the wholesurface of the device may be used for sensing, which increases thesensitivity. The dielectric layer may also reduce the temperaturecoefficient of delay. Further, by appropriate choice of dielectricmaterial, e.g. derivatized silica, the need for an adhesion layerfor the immobilization of reagents on the surface can beeliminated.The device, according to the invention, is conveniently a two-portwaveguide sensor having spaced-apart input and output electrodes.Alternatively, the device may be a one-port resonator having asingle electrode with a reflective metallic grating on either side.The gratings reflect the acoustic waves, a resonant cavity beingformed between the gratings. Also, the gratings affect mass loadingof the surface. For this latter purpose, a grating may be includedin the two-port device, between the input and output electrodes.In use, the device is immersed in a liquid to be tested, or a dropof liquid is applied to the surface of the layer of silicondioxide. If the liquid contains the species that binds with thereagent immobilized on the surface of the layer, a change in massoccurs at that surface. This slows the acoustic wave and alters thephase of the output signal. The change in phase provides aquantitative indication of the presence of the analyte in thesample.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996New Modified LaserFluorometric DetectorIn recent years, there has been an explosive growth in capillaryelectrophoresis (CE) for separations of a wide variety ofcompounds.  The high efficiencies that can be obtained for mostseparations are very beneficial and can alleviate some difficultiesassociated with the separation of complex samples. Brian Clark andMichael Sepaniak of the University of Tennessee (Dept. ofChemistry, Knoxville, TN 37996-1600) published information on thedevelopment and evaluation of modified capillary electrophoresisinstrumentation with laser fluorometric detection. This allows forthe convenient and precise translation of the detection zone alongthe length of the separation column, according to the Journal ofMicrocolumn Separations  [7(6), 593-601, 1995].There are several anomalies that can limit efficiency and, hence,resolution in CE.  Among these are anomalous effects associatedwith electroosmotic flow, sample injection, temperature gradients,and non-uniform field phenomena.  Investigations of theaforementioned anomalies are difficult because detection iscommonly performed at a single detection point.  Many events thatcan have a profound impact on the separation process and occurprior to detection cannot be accurately studied.There have been several attempts to develop instrumentation capableof multi-point interrogation of separation systems.  Most involvea high level of instrumental complexity and high cost due to theuse of several detectors in series. The development of a cost-effective, experimentally simple device could benefit manyfundamental studies in CE, as well as address certain practicalproblems associated with optimizing the signal/noise ratio andminimizing separation time.The newly developed instrumentation is used for fundamental studiesof band dispersion, analyte mobility alterations, sample stacking,and the determination of diffusion coefficients.  The feasibilityof using this instrumentation to improve the signal/noise ratio anddecrease analysis time is presented.  DNA restriction digestseparations employing soluble polymer buffer systems with on-columnfluorescent labeling was used to illustrate the unique advantagesof this experimental design.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Continuous Separationof Solids, LiquidsFor the continuous separation of liquids and solids, TEMA has aunique centrifuge called the Conturbex.

The greatestportion of the liquid phase in the initial reaction mixture forzeolites X and Y is involved in the gel phase, and the separableamount of the liquid phase is significantly smaller than that fromthe well-crystallized one.Akira Yoshida of the Kyushu National Industrial Research Institute(Inorganic Materials Dept., Shuku-machi, Tosu-shi, Saga-ken 841Japan) has undertaken an analysis of the liquid phase during thecourse of crystallization of zeolite Y using an isothermalcentrifugal separation technique.  Results of the study have beenpublished in Zeolites [15, 739-744, 1995].Yoshida examined the concentrations of components in the liquidphase during the course of crystallization using a centrifugalreaction tube with an intermediate filter plate.  Using theseconcentration data and the amount of dissoluble species from thesolid portion by washing, the component concentrations in thenearest liquid layer to the surface of the solid portion wereestimated, and the amount of Na+ ions at the dangling bonds ofsilicate structure were evaluated.The first filtrate, which must have similar componentconcentrations in the liquid phase obtained by the usualfiltration, has lower concentrations of silica and Na+ ions, andconsequently, a lower specific gravity than those in the otherfiltrates.  The weight ratios of silica and sodium ions and theNa/Si molar ratios in the second, third, and fourth filtrates werenearly the same.The Na/Si molar ratios in the nearest liquid layer wasconspicuously higher than those in the filtrates because of thedissolution of Na+ ions from dangling bonds of the aluminosilicateframework.

Snyder reportsthat an ion-exchange resin serves as the stationary phase, anaqueous solution of ions based on a mixture of Er isotopes is thefeed phase, and an aqueous acid eluant solution is the mobilephase.  The process involves the mobile-phase eluting or desorbingthe Er isotope solute adsorbed on the stationary phase underconditions such that each of the naturally occurring isotopes of Eris eluted in a distinct volume.Er is used in nuclear fuel assembly designs as burnable poison witha high neutron capture cross section.  Its overall characteristicsare comparable to those of boron.  Er's chemical properties aresimilar to those of gadolinium (Gd) except that Er(III) is aslightly more acidic ion than Gd(III) in solution.  As a result,its separation chemistry should be more powerful than that of Gd insimilar eluents.The key issue in the design of a system for Er isotopic enrichmentchemistry is that the important fractions of the high cross sectionisotopes are embedded in undesirable isotopes.  This requiresmultiple extraction trains when using separations technologies suchas solvent extraction or fixed-bed ion-exchange columns, whichproduce "heads" and "tails" fractions but nothing in the "middle."As a result, multiple trains are required to dissect the fractionsuntil the desired head or tail emerges from the column as the soleconstituent of the product fraction.  This enrichment problem,coupled with the requirement for complex chemistry and hardware toseparate Er from ores, leads to several issues that must beaddressed by a process technology capable of recovering Er from rawore and refining it to an isotopically pure product for use innuclear fuel assembly design.The separation of Er from other rare earth elements and impuritiesin the ore leachate requires a large number of multistageextraction circuits because of the relatively low specificity ofthe distribution coefficients for most extraction solvents.  Alarge number of large, awkward, and expensive stages per extractionunit are required, and hazardous mixed wastes are generated as aresult of the organic solvents.  Peripheral purification operationsare also required to refine the Er and prepare it for isotopicenrichment.The new Westinghouse process uses a continuous annularchromatograph.  Erbium oxide dissolved in an aqueous mineral acidis fed to the chromatograph.  The stationary phase is a cation-exchange resin, and the mobile phase is normally aqueoushydrochloric acid.  Chelants, complexants or ligands may be addedto enhance the separation.  U.S. Patent 5,437,795 covers theWestinghouse invention.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996New ProcessPurifies FDPAnion-exchange chromatography can be used to purify fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), according to researchers at Unitika Ltd. (4-1-3Kyutaro-Machi, Chuo-Ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6-281-5712, Fax: 6-281-5563).  After desalting, the resultant FDP is used inpharmaceuticals, reports Tatsuo Katayama.Several processes exist for the production of FDP.  One involvesits synthesis from glucose and phosphoric acid through thefermentation of yeast cells.  Another technique uses glucose in thepresence of acetate kinase-containing cells or extracts, and acetylphosphate.  Additional purification is required to produce aproduct of pharmaceutical-grade quality.Although cation-exchange chromatography may be used, such a processmakes the FDP solution acidic.  Proteinous materials contained asimpurities in the solution are denatured and precipitated, and theprecipitate obstructs the passage of the FDP through the cation-exchange column.  One alternative is to remove the proteinousimpurities from the FDP solution prior to the cation-exchangetreatment using heat or a hydrochloric acid-based technique.  Theproblem with this approach is that during this pretreatment stepsome of the FDP is also denatured and lost, reducing the final FDPyield.The Unitika scientists improved FDP yields by using anion-exchangechromatography and a subsequent desalting separation such aselectrodialysis (ED) or reverse osmosis (RO). Suitable ED membranesare manufactured from hydrocarbon-based, fluorine-containing  highpolymer materials.  Polyamides are normally used for the ROmembranes.  U.S. Patent 5,434,255 further details the Unitika work.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Large-Scale MethodPurifies ProteinsAdvantages of immobilized metal affinity chromatography or IMACinclude the optimal control of ligand density.  Binding sites areenergetically homogeneous with respect to each adsorbing species,and selectivity is high, producing 3000-fold purification in asingle step.  The separation of proteins can be achieved withminimum denaturation, it is relatively easy to maintain sterileconditions during operation, and solvents are cheap andenvironmentally friendly.Large-scale immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)techniques intended for the purification of proteins and peptideswere devised by scientists at Purdue University (School of ChemicalEngineering, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1283; Tel: 317/494-4050).Kamran Khan, Zidu Ma, Segal Patel, and N. H. Linda Wang report thatthe research team determined the adsorption isotherms of imidazole,His-Ala dipeptide, chicken egg-white lysozyme, and horse heartmyoglobin using single- and multiple-step frontal chromatography.Protein adsorption in IMAC is a complicated process involving aseries of steric, chemical, kinetic, and thermodynamic variables.It can be further complicated by multi-site binding andheterogeneity in binding.  One of the more important quantitiesneeded for competition studies and understanding of the dynamicadsorption behavior is the equilibrium adsorption isotherm.Breakthrough curves under column overload conditions in high-performance liquid chromatography can be used to obtain theisotherm information.  Although direct measurement of thecompetition between adsorbed molecules is complicated in IMACsystems, studies on the maximum capacity of a protein in thepresence of imidazole at a constant concentration can provideinformation on the competition as well as simplify data analysis.In the Purdue research, the capacity for copper, or Cu(II), ionswas quantified.  Imadazole isotherm measurements were determinedfor metal-charged and metal-free columns, and dipeptide isothermswere measured.

Electrophoresis, horizontal and vertical electroblottingand/or electroelution, vacuum blotting, capillary blotting,ultraviolet (UV) observation of ethidium bromide labeled specimens,UV photography, and UV crosslinking may all be performed.  Featuresof the apparatus include buffer circulation, light opaqueenclosure, DNA band compaction, and DNA elution without cutting theDNA band.Gel electrophoresis remains a key analytical tool in molecularbiology and clinical sciences.  The electrophoresis of DNA andother organic molecules under the influence of an electric fieldinvolves the casting of a semisolid gel of agarose orpolyacrylamide in a mold to produce a thin, rectangular slab.Wells, or depressions, are formed in the upper surface of the slabalong a line at one end.  The gel slab is placed in chamber withelectrodes at each end, and the chamber is filled with a buffersolution to a level higher than the gel.  Some wells are filledwith a solution containing the sample, and a high-gradient electricfield is applied to the gel through the buffer solution.  Themolecules in the sample separate into bands by migrating throughthe gel slab toward the oppositely charged electrodes at differentrates depending on their mobility, a function of molecular chargedensity and size.Gels are fragile.  Manipulation can rip or distort them, resultingin unreliable test results.  The usefulness of electrophoresisdepends on producing thin, well-defined molecular sample bands.Such definition depends partially on the manner in which themolecular sample migrates from the sample well along the gel.The sample well, the distribution of the sample in the well, andthe electric field influence band definition.  A sample oncedeposited in a well migrates horizontally through the gel as avertically oriented rectangle.  The sides of the sample rectangletend to migrate slower than the central portion, resulting in a U-shaped dispersed band.  A macromolecular sample deposited in thefront corner of the well migrates horizontally as a compact linethrough a comparatively small volume of gel, resulting in narrow,straight, well-defined bands.  An operator must exercise extremecare in loading the sample to obtain a well-defined band.  Theproblem is that, despite such care, electrophoretic results areoften diminished by the presence of U-shaped, dispersed,macromolecular sample bands.The new device, fully described in U.S. Patent 5,449,446, is asingle, integrated apparatus capable of the execution of molecularseparation in a gel, subsequent molecular transfer to a membrane,and photography of the results.  The unit includes a power source,an electrophoresis-electroblot-transilluminator, a viewing hood, acamera hood, and UV-radiation sources for sample detection andcrosslinking.The unit can horizontally separate sample molecules within a geland the subsequent vertical or horizontal transfer of the moleculesto an adjacent membrane by electroblotting, capillary-blotting, orvacuum-blotting techniques.  The UV-radiation source irradiates thegel to cause fluorescence of the sample.  The UV-radiation sourcecrosslinks the separated sample to the membrane.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Assay Offers InVitro EvaluationThe gel mobility shift assay is a useful tool for rapid andeconomical evaluation of chemicals in vitro for DNA-damaging orpromoter effects.  The Molecular Toxicology Group at the Oak RidgeNational Laboratory has investigated the risks of human exposure toradiation and chemicals using the newest molecular biology-basedprocedures.  The group identifies new biomarkers, designs andevaluates new in vitro assays.Advances in the molecular biology of cancer are providing a uniqueopportunity to design more reliable assays to evaluate human healthrisks.  These assays can provide rapid, economical, and reliableevaluation of the potential carcinogenicity of genotoxic and non-genotoxic chemicals.DNA-damaging and cancer chemotherapeutic agents increase p53-DNAsite-specific finding in treated cells.  The Oak Ridge scientistsconducted p53-gel mobility shift assays on NOVEX (11040 RoselleSt., San Diego, CA 92121-1222; Tel: 800/456-6839 or 619/452-6634,Fax: 619/452-6635) 6% DNA Retardation Gels to identify chemicalsthat damage DNA or affect enzymes that modify DNA.  Cells aretreated with a suspected DNA-damaging agent for a short time (twoto four hours).  The cells are lysed and extracts containing p53are incubated with the [32P]-end labeled p53 consensus bindingsequence.  Gel mobility shift assays are performed on NOVEX 6% DNAretardation gels with 1/2x TBE as the running buffer.Chemicals that mimic estrogen's growth-stimulating activities havebeen called environmental estrogens or xenoestrogens.  Estrogen-like promoters can be identified using gel-mobility shift assays.For example, pesticides, dyes, and pollutants increase binding ofthe estrogen receptor (ER) to the estrogen response element (ERE).The ER-ERE complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a NOVEX6% DNA retardation gel.  Human breast cells treated with estrogenor DDT show increased amounts of ER complexed to the ERE;therefore, gel-mobility shift assays performed on NOVEX pre-castgels can rapidly identify potential environmental estrogens.The use of NOVEX pre-cast gels for these procedures simplifies theassay, makes them more user friendly, and decreases the timerequired to perform them.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Pall ChangesIV ConceptA new concept in intravenous (IV) fluid filtration has beendeveloped by Pall Biomedical Products Co.

When the Pall IV filter is used, the interval forroutine IV set change can be extended up to 96 hours, resulting ina reduction in set use and costs.  Nursing time associated withintravenous administration (set changes, restarts, and problemresolution) is also reduced.The DUO96 filter contains a Posidyne 0.2 micron Nylon 66 membrane,a hydrophilic filter medium that is easily wetted and easilyprimed.

This is because increased DHCresults in more economical filtration.  However, it is difficult toachieve higher DHC without compromising the efficiency of thefilter.Most filter manufacturers have devised increasing DHC by improvingthe filter media.  The amount any filter medium can hold isdirectly proportional to the void volume or open area in the media.Over the years, millions of dollars have been spent on developingmedia that will hold more contaminant.  It is a difficult taskbecause in any given medium, if you increase the void volume, youdecrease contaminant-removal efficiency.To increase DNC without compromising removal efficiency,manufacturers have altered the structure of the media.  Despiteusing finer fibers, greater loft, more entanglement, and multiplelayers, or by forming asymmetric pores and creating greater poredensity, filter media manufacturers have been able to achieve onlymodest increases in DNC.Spiraltek rolled-cartridge filters from Osmonics (5951 ClearwaterDrive, Minnetonka, MN  55343;  Tel: 612/933-2277,  Fax: 612/933-0141) represent a new concept in filtration.  The filter wasdeveloped using a knowledge of crossflow technology.  In crossflowfiltration, the media is continuously cleaned by the process fluidthat flows across the media surface.  The fluid flow ismechanically restricted downstream, such that a portion of the flowpasses through the media, while the remainder passes beyond therestriction. The portion that did not go through the media containsa concentrated level of contaminant.Spiraltek filters employ the basics of crossflow filtration, butthe downstream restriction is entirely closed.  The result is afluid flow that continuously cleans the media surface without asecondary stream containing concentrated contaminant.  Ascontaminant is pushed towards the sealed end of the filter, thecontaminant packs against itself in a non-porous section of thefilter.  Restriction to flow increases very slowly and the filteroperates steadily for a longer period of time.  The end result isless dependence on the void volume of the media for increased DNCand a quantum increase in DNC based on the filter construction.The new filters have been successfully applied in the field andsubjected to unbiased, head-to-head comparison testing.  Testresults show that Spiraltek filters hold three to six times morecontaminant per square foot of filter media when compared to otherpleated filters.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Perkin-Elmer FormsHuman Genome CRADAPerkin-Elmer's (761 Main Ave., Norwalk, CT  06859;  Tel: 203/762-1000,  Fax: 203/762-6000) Applied Biosystems Division todayannounced the formation of a Cooperative Research And DevelopmentAgreement (CRADA) with the National Center for Human GenomeResearch (NCHGR) to  increase the speed of large-scale genotypingto identify complex  human genetic diseases.Under the terms of the CRADA, Perkin-Elmer will supply the NCHGRwith Applied Biosystems Genetic Analysis Systems to enhance NCHGR'scurrent gene-discovery effort aimed at finding the geneticcomponent  of late-onset diabetes and prostate cancer.

This molasses has a high sugar content and is treatedto extract the sugars.Such conventional treatment involves subjecting the molasses to anion-exclusion chromatography process using a fixed support of astrong sodium (Na) or potassium (K) cation resin.  The problem isthat magnesium (Mg) and/or calcium (Ca) salts dissolved in themolasses and, as charged Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions, replace the Na+ andK+ ions during the chromatography operation, reducing theseparating power of the technique.  As a result, the chromatographyoperation is interrupted periodically to regenerate the cationresin.Regeneration reagent is consumed, and productivity is reduced.  Oneapproach to overcome the problem involves the elimination of theCa2+ and/or Mg2+ ions prior to the chromatography step.  Such atechnique also requires the use of a regeneration reagent and hasthe additional disadvantage of producing wastewater-containingsugar, reducing the yield from the overall process.In the new process, the sugar juice is softened by bringing it intocontact with Na+ and/or K+ cation-exchange resins in a conventionalmanner.  The key to the new technique is the regeneration part ofthe process, which makes clever use of one of the liquid effluentsin a sugar factory.  The raffinate generated during thechromatographic separation and charged with Na+ and/or K+ ions isnormally discarded.  The researchers concentrated the raffinate andused it to regenerate the resin used in the primary separation.U.S. Patent 5,443,650 covers the new technique.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Japanese Team TurnsAttention to LithiumResearchers at the Shikoku National Industrial Research Institute(2217-14 Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu 761-03, Japan) and SophiaUniversity (7-1 Kioicho, Chiyodaku, Tokyo 102, Japan) have studiedlithium isotope fractionation properties on five kinds of inorganicion exchangers with different ion-sieve properties.Because of its low nuclear cross section for thermal neutrons, 7Liis useful for the control of corrosion and the pH of coolant watersin nuclear reactors.  Lithium isotope fractionation by two-phasechemical exchange has been extensively studied in systems with alithium amalgam, lithium metal, an ion-exchange resin, and amacrocyclic polyether.  However, there have been only a smallnumber of studies on lithium isotope fractionation with inorganicion exchangers since the first pioneer work by Tayler and Urey withaluminosilicate.Inorganic ion exchangers have attracted attention owning to theirremarkably high selectivity for certain metal ions or groups ofions.  The specific characteristics of inorganic ion exchangersarise partly from their rigid structure, which undergoes littleswelling or shrinking in the aqueous phase.  This brings about astrong steric effect or an ion-sieve effect for various ions,depending on the hydrated or dehydrated size of the adsorbing ions.In the Shikoku/Sophia study, published in Separation Science andTechnology [30(20), 3761-3770, 1995], the lithium isotopeseparation factors were determined batchwise in a LiOH or (LiCl +LiOH) solution at 25C or 20C, respectively.  The separationfactor increased in the order birnessite-type manganese oxide Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Characterization ofSPLITT's PersonalitySPLITT fractionation (SF) is a relatively new family of separationtechniques primarily, but not exclusively, applicable tomacromolecules and particles.  The efficacy of SF requires anabsence of hydrodynamic mixing between laminae constituting thethin liquid film streaming through a SPLITT cell, and it requiresstructural elements capable of splitting the film evenly alongstreamplanes.  These requirements were examined, bothexperimentally and by numerical analysis of flow properties nearthe inlet splitter, by a team including C. Bor Fuh, Edward M.Trujillo, and J. Calvin Giddings of the University of Utah (SaltLake City, UT 84112).As reported in Separation Science and Technology [30(20), 3861-3876, 1995], the SF techniques utilize a thin ribbon-shaped flowcell and achieve fractionation by differential transport across thethin (transverse) axis of the cell.  Since the cell is only a fewhundred microns thick, the separation path (which cannot exceed butmay be less than the channel thickness) is extremely short andseparative transport is correspondingly rapid.  Separation istypically accomplished in only a few minutes.  This is aparticularly valuable feature for fragile biological species thatmust be fractionated rapidly to avoid degradation.SF is capable of continuous operation and is thus useful as apreparative technique for processing gram, kilogram, or largerquantities of materials.  The separation is rigorously controlledby adjusting the two inlet flow rates and the two outlet flow ratesand, in some cases, by altering the strength of the field orgradient driving the separative transport.  The simplicity of theSPLITT cell leads to rather rigorous theoretical guidelines on theconditions necessary to achieve a given level of separation.The principal transverse driving forces used in SPLITT cellsinclude gravity, centrifugation, diffusion, and electricalpotential gradients.  However, except for moderate curvature in thecentrifugal SPLITT cell, the geometry of the different cells issimilar.Among the various topics explored by the University of Utah team,the one of greatest practical interest is the partial delineationof a range of flow conditions in which SPLITT fractionation can becarried out without concern for hydrodynamic disturbances.  Theability to achieve effective fractionation under these conditionsis supported by experimental results showing that SPLITT cellperformance is in reasonable agreement with theory.This work also begins to answer the question of how far flowconditions can be pushed before fractionation is degraded byhydrodynamic disturbances.  A tentative boundary has been found forboth squared-off splitter edges and tapered edges such thatperformance at higher Reynolds numbers and flow asymmetries issuspect.  Performance beyond these boundaries has not beensignificantly tested.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH TECH SEPARATIONS NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Technetium fromAlkaline SolutionsTechnetium (Tc) can be extracted from alkaline solutions of nuclearwaste using a new process formulated by scientists at theDepartment of Energy (DOE).  The technique involves contacting thesolution with a solvent containing a crown ether in a diluent.  Thetechnetium-containing solvent is separated from the solution, andthe Tc is then stripped from the solvent, reports Bruce A. Moyer.Fission products resulting from the irradiation of nuclear reactorfuels require long-term storage in an insoluble form.  About 1.8metric tons of technetium is contained in 60 million gallons ofhigh-level radioactive wastes stored at Hanford, WA.  These wastesare highly alkaline, with a pH of at least 13, and are concentratedin alkali metal nitrates, such as sodium nitrate.  Removal of Tcfrom such wastes is a good idea because of safety considerationsand the environmental problems associated with its long-termstorage. These wastes provide a resource from which Tc can berecovered for experimental uses.Although crown ethers have previously been considered for theextraction of technetium under alkali conditions, the impact ofhigh concentrations of alkali metal nitrates on the distributioncoefficient of technetium has not been addressed.  The DOEresearchers found that the concentration of sodium nitrate in thewaste solution plays a key role in determining the efficiency ofextraction and stripping.  Suitable diluents for use in the DOEprocess include aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon, ketone,pyridine, ether, nitrile, phosphoryl, or alcohol solvents that arewater immiscible and inert.

An important aspect is thepreparation of strong and tough amorphous materialsable to degrade in the human body by hydrolysis, toyield harmless compounds.  The materials are primarilydesigned for use as bone plates and screws inmaxillofacial surgery, but many other uses in medicineand other fields are conceivable.  Materials based onL-lactide are prepared by copolymerization with severalother cyclic esters, by blending amorphouspoly(lactide) polymers with degradable rubbers, and bysynthesizing block copolymers containing poly(lactide)sequences.

ShoibalBanerjee reports that the membrane attains greater mechanicalstrength than conventional materials used for such applicationswithout sacrificing other required qualities.  The DuPont membrane,which includes a fluorinated ion exchange polymer film bonded to aporous hydrocarbon substrate, is nonporous to the bulk flow offluids but permits ions, especially cations, to move across itsstructure.In electrochemical cells, such as electrolytic cells or fuel cells,it is important to provide a separator between the anode andcathode compartments.  Chemically stable ion exchange membranesmade from perfluorosulfonic acid polymers are used, particularlyfor the electrolysis of brine. DuPont's trademarked Nafion membraneis a well recognized membrane of this type.Quality, safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness considerationsspecify that fuel cell separators should be tear, abrasion,puncture, and scratch resistant.  On the other hand, they shouldnot be so thick and/or reinforced that they are resistant to ionicconduction or power requirements are excessively high.Membrane resistance can be reduced by decreasing the membranethickness and increasing its water content.  The problem is thatalong with a reduction in electrical resistance, this brings abouta big reduction in membrane strength.  Mechanical strength inelectrochemical cells is important.Many fuel cells operate at high differential pressures, whichincrease the likelihood of damage to the membranes.  Fuel cellsused in motor vehicles are subject to multiple shutdown and startupprocedures, and this cycling leads to membrane dehydration andrehydration.  The resultant stress further increases the likelihoodof damage to the membrane.Reinforced ion exchange membranes are also used to separatemixtures of fluids with different permeation rates.  Such membranesare often wound with macroporous meshes which permit the free flowof fluids to and from the membrane surfaces.  Thin perfluoroionomerfilms have high permeability to water and other polar molecules,but effective permeation separation modules cannot be manufacturedfrom these thin, fragile materials.Facilitated transport is a related separation technique in which acontinuous membrane is plasticized or swollen with a liquid.  Thedissolved liquid complexes with one of the fluids to be separatedand selectively facilitates its transport across the membrane.Although perfluoroionomer offer advantages in some of theseapplications, e.g., the separation of amino acids in aqueous media,they do not have enough strength to undergo module construction orto withstand operating pressure differentials.The porous substrate of the DuPont membrane is made from a linearhigh density polyethylene (LHDPE) polyolefin hydrocarbon woven ornonwoven fabric with a melting point below 220(C.  The bond betweenthe substrate and the fluorinated polymer is formed by applying asolvent to the surface of the substrate and then adding thesubstrate.  The ion exchange polymer, a perfluorosulfonate orperfluorocarboxylate, is solubilized by the solvent and flows intoand adheres to the pores of the substrate.  Suitable solventsinclude aliphatic alcohols, perfluorinated aromatic compounds, andperfluorotrialkylamines.The DuPont composite membrane could be used as a reinforced thinselective barrier in chemical separations, providing mechanicalstrength without sacrificing low resistance to the selectivetransport characteristics inherent in a thin perfluoro ion exchangemembrane.  The membrane may be used as an electrolytic separatorbetween anode and cathode compartments in a fuel cell.  It may alsobe used as a thin, continuous barrier in permeation separations andin facilitated transport operations.  The fabric providesmechanical support and the spaces between the fibers provideavenues for fluids to pass to and from the surface of the membranewithout sacrificing the high permeation rates to water and otherhydrophilic materials.

(Doswell Combined CycleFacility, Rte. 4, P.O. Box 1643, Ashland, VA 23005), ResourcesConservation Co. (3006 Northup Way, Bellevue, WA 98004; Tel:206/828-2400) and Ionics Inc. (5455 Garden Grove Blvd., No. 321,Westminster, CA 92683) have been working on the integration ofmembrane processes with evaporation to achieve economical zeroliquid discharge at the Doswell Combined Cycle Facility.  Theresults of this study were published in Desalination (102, 81-86,1995).New restrictive permitting, operating and environmentalrequirements placed on independent power producers, utility powerplants, chemical processing plants, refineries and other industrialinstallations are mandating zero liquid discharge of wastewater tosewers, rivers, deep wells and the like.  Economic reclamation andreuse of wastewater is becoming essential.Since the mid-70s, vapor compression evaporation has been apreferred means to achieve zero liquid discharge.  Evaporationrecovers about 95% of a wastewater as distillate for reuse.  Wastebrine can be reduced to solids in a crystallizer/dewatering device.However, evaporation alone can be an expensive option when flowrates are large or when wastewater is not extremely high in totaldissolved solids (TDS).  As a result, grassroots power plants andother industrial facilities often find it difficult to economicallyjustify a zero liquid discharge system.One way to solve this problem is to integrate membrane processeswith evaporation.  By combining membrane processes such aselectrodialysis reversal (EDR) and/or reverse osmosis (RO) withevaporation, the synergism makes zero liquid discharge an easiergoal to achieve.An example of this hybrid approach for economical zero liquiddischarge is the installation of EDR plus RO along with evaporationand crystallization at the Doswell combined Cycle Power Plant inHanover County, VA.  Use of membrane processes to preconcentrateand reclaim plant wastewaters has significantly reduced theevaporator feed volume, resulting in a 62% downsizing of theevaporator system.Without the EDR and RO system, the evaporator/crystallizer systemwould have treated 250 gallons per minute of wastewater at a totaldissolved solids concentration of 2900 parts per million.  Usingthe combined EDR and RO systems to pretreat wastewater helpedreduce the evaporator feed volume to about 90 gpm with a higher TDSconcentration of 9700 ppm.  Compared to straightevaporation/crystallization, the hybrid approach reduced overallcapital costs by $900,000 and saves energy and operating costs by$680 per operating day.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Lea Ronal's NewH3PO2 Acid MethodLea Ronal Inc. (272 Buffalo Ave., Freeport, NY 11520; Tel: 516/868-8800, Fax: 516/868-8774) has been issued a patent for electrolyticproduction of phosphinic (hypophosphorous) acid (U.S. 5,480,517).Hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2) or phosphinic acid, is a staple acidof commerce and is sold for uses such as the manufacture ofhypophosphite salts, as well as to prevent the discoloration ofphosphate esters, in esterification catalysts, and for themanufacture of cooling water treatment chemicals. H3PO2 finds usein metal finishing procedures, as a reducing agent for electrolessplating, and as a sealer for phosphated steel.The manufacture of hypophosphorous acid has generally been carriedout by somewhat complex and expensive methods utilizing ionexchange procedures. In these procedures the sodium ion of sodiumhypophosphite is exchanged for a hydrogen ion using an ion exchangeresin therefor. These procedures result in hypophosphorous acidbeing a rather expensive commodity, generally at over $7.00 perpound.Electrodialysis is also a known process which has been utilized forvarious purposes. Alkali salt-containing aqueous solutions withsalts and complexes of metal anions and cations can be fed to thecatholyte, and the metal cations are removed as insolublehydroxides by controlling the pH therein. In this process, theanions are transported across an anion permeable membrane into theanolyte, where they are converted to acids or halogens.It is of interest to develop a novel and more economical method forproducing hypophosphorous acid. Lea Ronal's method for preparinghypophosphorous acid comprises electrodialysis using anionic andcationic exchange membranes to convert hypophosphite salts, such asalkali metal hypophosphite salts, into hypophosphorous acid andalkali hydroxide. These results are achieved by conductingelectrodialysis through an insoluble anode and an anolytecomprising hypophosphite ions and a cathode and a catholytecomprising alkali (sodium) ions. Electrolysis of the water supplieshydrogen ions to the anolyte and hydroxyl ions to the catholyte.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Palladium CompositeRemoves HydrogenA hydrogen selective palladium-ceramic composite membrane designedby researchers at Oregon State University (OSU, Corvallis, OR97331; Tel: 541/737-0123) is one more attempt to overcome theproblems associated with conventional membranes intended for theseparation of hydrogen from gas mixtures at high temperatures andpressures.  John P. Collins and J. Douglas Way formed the newmembrane described in U.S. Patent 5,451,386, from a porous,tubular, asymmetric ceramic support with pore sizes in excess of 10nanometers (nm).  The scientists deposited a layer of palladium 10-20 microns thick on the inside surface of the ceramic support.Numerous industrial processes require the selective removal ofhydrogen from a reaction media, e.g., the production of hydrogen bydecomposing ammonia and recovering hydrogen from the resultantmixture.  Key factors in this process are the temperature andpressure of the reaction mixture.  It can be difficult to separatea gas from a mixture at high temperatures and pressures usingconventional packed bed reactors because high concentrations ofhydrogen and nitrogen favor the formation of ammonia.The three materials commonly used in membranes to remove hydrogenare polymers; metals or metal alloys, e.g., palladium or palladiumalloys; and ceramics.  Each has problems that restricteffectiveness in separating the hydrogen.  Polymers have lowthermal and mechanical strength.  Metal and metal alloy membranesare impractical for use on a commercial scale because of high cost,low hydrogen flux, and a tendency to deform at high temperatures.Ceramics can resist high temperatures and pressures, but they allowmixtures of ammonia, hydrogen, and nitrogen to filter through themembrane showing low selectivity.The OSU composite membrane can selectively remove hydrogen from gasmixtures at pressures in the 500(C range and transmembranepressures of about 1,500 kPa.  The hydrogen-to-nitrogen selectivityis about 600.The membranes are produced in a four-step process that includes theuse of sensitizing, activating, and plating solutions;pretreatment; activation; and plating.  First, the ceramic tubesare placed in a sensitizing bath which deposits a layer ofcolloidal tin ions on their inside surfaces.  Solutions of tin (IV)chloride pentahydrate and tin (II) chloride dihydrate are used tomake the sensitizing bath.  Second, the activating bath, a solutionof palladium chloride, deposits a uniform layer of finely dispersedpalladium crystals on the ceramic membrane surfaces.  The thirdbath, which involves a tetramine palladium chloride complex, is thesource of the activated palladium metal applied to the structure.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Air Products Offersa Radiation CureJohn Kaiser and Diwakar Garg of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.(7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA 18195; Tel: 610/481-4911) havediscovered a method of producing a low-cost, nitrogen-based inertatmosphere suitable for radiation curing of resins, coatings, etc.(U.S. Patent 5,480,682).  Residual oxygen present in non-cryogenically generated nitrogen is converted to either moisture ora mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide by reaction with areducing gas in a catalytic reactor prior to using the nitrogen-based atmosphere for radiation curing of moisture insensitivematerials such as resins and coatings.Radiation curing is a chemical manufacturing process which utilizeselectromagnetic radiation energy to change the chemical andphysical nature of organic chemical materials by cross-linking,polymerizing, drying, solidifying or degrading polymer network.Radiation curing processes are commercially applied today foradhesives, abrasives, release coatings, metal coatings, overprintcoatings, flooring, wood finishing, food and perfume packaging,printing, photopolymer plates, electronics, dental and medicalapplications, magnetic media, fiber optics, lithography, etc.The primary sources of radiation for radiation curing includeelectron beam (e-beam), infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), and laser.It is generally known that a part of radiation energy used forcuring resins and coatings is converted to heat during curing,causing an increase in the atmosphere temperature. It is known thatan increase in the atmosphere temperature will raise thetemperature of the coating being cured, which can damage thecoating or result in cured coating with some undesirableproperties. It is, therefore, desirable to carefully control thetemperature of both the atmosphere and the coating being cured toobtain optimum material properties.Overheating of the atmosphere and the coating being cured can becontrolled by using a high speed at which the curing coatingtraverses under the radiation source. Additionally, a water-cooleddrum positioned directly under the radiation source can also beused to help in removing heat from the radiation chamber and thesubstrate being cured. However, black bodies, soft substrates, andtemperature sensitive substrates still require proper care and anexternal source for removing heat from the radiation chamber.To properly control the temperature in the radiation chamber andproduce cured coatings with desirable properties, these materialsare generally processed in the presence of high flow rates of anambient temperature and high purity (containing 99.999% by volumeinert gas) inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon or helium. The highflow rate of high purity inert gas helps in removing heat andpreventing buildup of heat in the radiation chamber.Besides controlling the temperature of the coating, high purityinert gas prevents buildup of oxygen in the radiation curingchamber, which is known to abstract hydrogen from the coatingmaterial and inhibit the curing process, as well as form ozone gas.The use of high purity nitrogen gas for inerting radiation curingchambers and purging oxygen barriers has been known for years. Thenitrogen gas used in radiation curing is generally supplied byvaporizing more expensive cryogenically produced high purity liquidnitrogen.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Ceramic CompositeSeparates OxygenThe Gas Research Institute (3424 S. State St., Chicago, IL  60616)has developed composite ceramic ion and electronic conductionmaterials with high ambipolar activity which can be fabricated intothin membranes for high efficiency oxygen separation from air atintermediate temperatures (U.S. Patent 5,478,444).The mixed conducting materials have composite non-homogeneousmicrostructures of a separate predominantly oxygen ion conductivephase and a predominantly electronic conductive phase.Predominantly oxygen ion conducting phases include bismuth, ceriumand thorium oxide based materials and predominantly electronicconducting phases include at least one metal, metal oxide of atleast one metal, and at least one perovskite-type electronicconductor material.Prior materials used in oxygen separation have been electrolytematerials, such as yttrium stabilized zirconia or ceria with CaF2fluorite structure, which are predominantly oxygen ion conductors.In electrolytes of such predominantly ionic conducting materials,oxygen transport takes place on the ionic conducting electrolytewhile electrons move through an external electron circuit tomaintain electrical neutrality.In addition to electrolyte materials such a prior device requiredtwo electrodes as well as an external connection between theelectrodes, for example, porous platinum electrode layers andplatinum wire leads, both operating at high temperatures. An oxygensemipermeation separation device according to the present inventionbased on a mixed ionic-electronic conduction composite electrolytemembrane eliminates the two porous electrodes and external electroncircuit.Solid oxygen ion conducting electrolytes based on zirconium oxideor cerium oxide have been used, but require relatively highoperating temperatures of about 1,000C since oxygen ionicconductivity of these materials becomes significant only at hightemperatures, such as about 0.1 S/cm total electrical conductivityat 1,000C for yttria stabilized zirconia.Bismuth oxide has an electrical conductivity of higher than 0.33S/cm at 750C which is much higher than zirconium oxide or ceriumoxide at that temperature. Use of ionic-electronic mixed conductingmaterials based on bismuth oxide as an electrolyte, according tothis invention, permits the operating temperature of an oxygenseparation device to be at markedly lower temperatures than priorzirconium oxide or cerium oxide based materials.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MontmorilloniteShows PromiseIt has been known for a long time that a membrane made of a pureclay rejects ionic solutes.  The application of such a membrane inseparation technology, however, has never been attempted.Researchers from The National Research Institute of AgriculturalEngineering (2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305 Japan), and theUniversity of Ottawa (Industrial Membrane Research Institute, Dept.of Chemical Engineering, and Dept. of Chemistry, Ottawa K1N 6N5)explored that possibility by investigating the solute separationcharacteristics of a montmorillonite membrane.  Their findings havebeen published in Journal of Membrane Science [107, 87-92, 1995].As membrane separation technology broadens its scope, resistanceagainst heat, chemicals and corrosion becomes an increasinglydesired feature of the membrane material.  Unfortunately, polymericmaterials form which most commercial membranes are produced do notnecessarily meet these requirements.  For this reason, many studieshave been conducted on the development of inorganic membranes.Various methods have been applied to prepare membranes frominorganic material.  Alumina membranes were prepared by the sol-gelmethod for ultrafiltration and microfiltration, zeolite membraneswere prepared for the separation of gas and vapor mixtures, andzeolite particles were incorporated into silicone rubber to form acomposite membrane for pervaporation.A montmorillonite membrane with a thickness of 0.5 mm was preparedby sandwiching purified clay paste between two millipore filtersand reverse osmosis experiments were conducted for variousinorganic and organic solutes under an operating pressure of 3 MPa.The membrane exhibited characteristics typical for a chargedmembrane by rejecting sodium chloride solute less effectively withincreasing solute concentration.  The rejection of small organicsolutes was very low.  It was also found that the separation ofamino acids greatly depends on the net charge carried by the aminoacid molecule.  This membrane, it was found, opens up a route tothe effective fractionation of electrolyte/non-electrolyte mixturesand amino acid mixtures.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Depositing Mol Sieveson Macroporous SupportEduard Geus and a team of Technische Universiteit Delft(Julianalaan 134, 2628 BL Delft, The Netherlands; Tel: 15/789111,Fax: 15/786522) researchers have made what they believe is abreakthrough in creating a membrane that has the advantages ofmolecular sieves membranes without the disadvantages.  Theirtechnology applies molecular sieve crystals, in a monolayer, on amacroporous support.  The crystals have been oriented to asubstantial extent, such that the pores of the sieve crystals forma significant included angle with the support surface.  Themembrane forms a gastight matrix between the crystals.Geus et al write, in U.S. Patent 5,429,743, that their goal is tomanufacture a membrane with the highest possible degree of coverageof molecular sieve crystals on the support.  In this way,researchers realize the maximum membrane surface.  They emphasizethe importance of the form of the crystals and the uniformity ofthe particle size.  The use of crystalline microporous materials,such as the molecular sieve crystals, makes it possible to adjustthe pore size distribution on a molecular level.The scientists describe the best configuration for a molecularsieve membrane as occurring when the crystals are the onlyseparation between two fluids.  Then molecules can pass directlyfrom the first (or retentate) phase to the second (or permeate)phase only through the micropores of the molecular sieve crystals.One method involves the scattering of molecular sieve crystals onthe support.  Low frequency vibrations are used to form a crystalmonolayer that achieves about 80% coverage.  Even higher coveragecan be realized by using a liquid flow over a porous substrate withthe same liquid. This action pushes up the molecular sieve crystalsup to form an almost continuous layer on the support.In another process, molecular sieve crystals are treated with asurfactant, facilitating the formation of a hydrophobic surface bythe crystals.  These molecular sieves float on water.  Amacroporous support can be formed underneath the monolayer ofmolecular sieve crystals.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Add Two More toU.S. Filter RosterA U.S. Filter Corp.

Their findings are reported inJournal of Membrane Science [108, 121-128, 1995).Crossflow operation is being used more and more to achieveefficient performance of membrane separations.  The most seriousoperational constraint in industrial use is the flux decline causedby membrane fouling.  Over the last decade, much research has beencarried out to investigate the microfiltration (MF) mechanismsunderlying the crossflow membrane modules.Several models which evaluate the transient and steady-state fluxduring crossflow MF have been studied based on the assumption ofthe incompressibility of the fouling layer and the rigidity ofsuspensoids.  Also, for fully understanding the effects of processparameters on the flux decline, an experimental study of membranefouling and permeate flux has been presented recently.The characteristics of dynamic MF with a rotating cylinder or disk-shaped medium has been examined for remarkably reducing membranefouling suing low compressibility suspended solids as experimentalmaterials.  In areas such as biotechnology, food engineering, andsewage treatment, however, it is known that the hydraulicresistance of the fouling layer to permeation shows a heavydependence on the operating pressure, and the compressibility ofthe deposits become an important factor for evaluating the fluxdecline during crossflow operation.The Nagoya research found that even when the ceramic membrane usedhas a much smaller pore size than the particle size of thesuspended solids, the crossflow MF process of dilute suspensiongenerally consists of two stages--media filtration at an earlierstage and thin-cake filtration at a later stage.  With the PMMAmaterial having an average particle size of 7.0 micron, the mediumfiltration period expands with decreasing solids concentration.When the filtration variables, such as the solids concentration andthe filtration pressure, pass a critical level the mediumfiltration period ceases, and thin-cake filtration covers the wholeprocess after the operation starts.  Its equilibrium flux can berelated to a number of operating variables in terms of a fewparameters including both the shear stress acting on the cakesurface and the Ruth's filtration coefficient.  Referring to thisempirical correlation, it becomes evident that, due to the effectsof the crossflow stream on the internal structure of fouling-layer,the high cake-compressibility yields a remarkable decrease in thesteady flux.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Treatment SoftensRegulatory BurdenIncreasingly, nanofiltration is being used to soften water inFlorida, particularly for applications where the feed water hashigh color and dissolved organics (which are precursors toregulated disinfectant byproducts).  Robert Bergman of CH2M Hill(7201 N.W. 11th Pl., Gainesville, FL 32605; Tel: 904/331-2442, Fax:904/331-5320) has undertaken a cost comparison study betweenmembrane and lime softening, and the results reported inDesalination [102, 1995, 11-24, 1995].In Florida, about 87% of public water supplies are derived fromgroundwater.  Commonly, these water supplies are classified asbeing "hard," that is, having relatively high concentrations ofcalcium.  Many of these supplies also have substantial dissolvedorganic color, hydrogen sulfide, and iron.Until about 10 years ago, essentially all municipal groundwatertreatment plants in Florida practicing softening used the limeprocess and, in many cases, relatively high dosages of chlorine fordisinfection and "bleaching-out color."  With the onset of morestringent drinking water standards, particularly for disinfectantsand disinfectant byproducts, and the development andcommercialization of nanofiltration membranes, new softening plantsin the state have favored membrane softening over lime in treatingcolored groundwater.In fact, Florida water utilities are the world leaders innanofiltration application in terms of installed capacity.Nanofiltration is a physical barrier treatment process thatseparates harness ions, dissolved organics, and total dissolvedsolids from water.Bergman's inquiry showed that lime softening plant costs were lowerthan membrane softening throughout the entire range, but therelative difference in costs decreased with larger facilities.  For15 mgd plants, the lower range of the membrane softening plantcosts is only about 10% greater than for lime softening plantcosts.  For any specific application, both softening technologiesshould be considered, at least for initial feasibility analysis.Furthermore, if additional treatment processes (such as ozone) areadded to lime softening to produce water quality comparable tomembrane softening permeate (with lower color and THMFP), membranesoftening can have lower construction costs than lime softening.Lime softening (alone) is generally less expensive than membranesoftening, assuming no bypass/blending and a 100% plant operatingfactor.  As plant capacities increase, the relative costs betweenthe two processes decrease.  Generally, membrane softening O&Mcosts are about 15% greater than lime softening O&M costs.Again, if additional treatment processes are added to limesoftening to match the better membrane softening permeate waterquality, or if some water can be bypassed around the membranes andblended to produce the finished water (thus taking advantage of thesuperior water quality from the membrane process), membranesoftening can be less expensive than lime softening.Bergman found that the slightly higher costs for membrane softeningover lime softening are more than justified for many utilities thatdesire the superior product water quality.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Osmonics RemovesHazardous RadiationThe use of nanofiltration has solved a nuclear wastewater disposalproblem for a hazardous waste remediation company.  The company wascontracted to process nearly 400,000 gal. of water contaminatedwith radioactive material.  The liquid waste containedapproximately 10% dissolved salts and other chemicals in additionto the radioactive contaminants.Traditional ion exchange and adsorption techniques had not beeneffective at removing the radioactive material and reverse osmosismembrane processing was not a viable option due to the excessiveosmotic pressure caused by the high salt concentration.Osmonics (5951 Clearwater Dr., Minnetonka, MN 55343; Tel: 612/933-2277, Fax: 612/933-0141) manufactured a crossflow membrane systemwith nanofiltration membrane elements which passed a highpercentage of the salts while retaining most of the radioactivematerial.  By passing a majority of the salts, the osmotic pressureeffect was negated, allowing  a successful application.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Modular Nozzlefor Hollow FibersBrown University Research Foundation (Providence, RI ) scientistsFrank Gentile, Michael Lysaght, and Nicholas Warner have inventeda new piece of apparatus for making hollow fibers (U.S. Patent5,480,598).No matter what the particular application of the hollow fibervehicles, the morphology and thickness of the fiber membrane mustbe controlled to obtain the desired mechanical and transportproperties suitable for the particular application.  Theconventional synthetic-fiber spinning methods that can be used toproduce hollow-fiber membranes: 1) melt spinning; 2) dry spinning;3) wet spinning; and 4) a combination of dry and wet spinning.  Ineach of these methods, a tubular cross-section of the hollow fiberis formed by delivering a spinning material such as a polymer,copolymer, cellulosic material, or the like, through a spinneretnozzle while simultaneously delivering a material to be housed inthe core of the fiber.Some of the problems associated with these prior art nozzleassemblies and hollow fiber forming techniques include an inabilityto form fibers from highly viscous thermoplastic polymers due tonozzle clogging, an inability to adjust the nozzle assembly toproduce varying membrane thicknesses and morphologies, an inabilityto change nozzle types or nozzle caps in the assembly so as toallow for the production of different types and shapes of hollowfibers, and an inability to produce Z-fibers having trabeculaeoriented substantially longitudinally within the fiber wall andsubstantially interconnected with one another within the fiberwall.The Brown University invention describes a nozzle assembly forforming hollow fibers, particularly a "Z-fiber" with longitudinallyoriented trabeculae with the fiber wall. The nozzle assemblycontains a replaceable nozzle cap, a replaceable seal-guide, and aretractable central bore used to supply core material for thehollow fibers. The Z-fibers are particularly useful in enablingcells, solutes, or the like, to enter the fiber wall and movelongitudinally into the center of the fiber wall.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Blotting StainIs ReversibleA new reversible protein blotting stain from Sigma Chemical Co.(P.O. Box 14508, St. Louis, MO 63178; Tel: 800/325-3010) providessensitivity and low background for blotting nylon, nitrocellulose,and PVDF membranes as well as PAGE gels. Blotting is a useful toolfor quickly screening complex mixtures of proteins and peptides.The probes for detecting the molecule of interest are labeled;ether radiolabeled, biotinylated, or enzyme-linked.Western blotting involves transferring proteins onto asemipermeable membrane, either directly from solution or afterelectrophoresis on polyacrylamide.  The membrane is probed with aprotein-specific primary antibody, then an enzyme-conjugatedsecondary antibody.  A chromogenic substrate for the conjugatedenzyme develops color only where the specific protein is found onthe membrane.In order to determine protein purity, a second visualizationmethod-a general protein stain-is needed, and that requiresduplicate gels.  However, correlation of bands on duplicate gels isoften difficult.  It would be useful to be able to stain theoverall protein pattern and then immunostain the same blot.  Forsuch an application, the general protein stain must be sensitiveand reversible and have low background binding to many membranetypes.If the immunostain recognizes only the native protein, the generalstain should leave the protein undernatured.  It is best that thestain not contain highly toxic components, so handling and disposalwould be simpler and safer.Sigma's new protein stain, a metal chelate called RPRO-B, meetsthese criteria.  This stain is suitable for nitrocellulose, nylon,and PVDF membranes as well as PAGE gels.  Destaining is a mildprocedure requiring only an EDTA solution, and the sensitivity andspecificity of immunostaining afterward are usually unaffected.Membranes are stained with the Sigma product by soaking at roomtemperature for about 3 minutes.  Polyacrylamide gels should befixed first, stained with RPRO-B for 40 minutes, then destained inthe fixing solution.  Brilliant Blue R remains the stain of choicefor permanent staining of proteins on PVDF membranes andpolyacrylamide gels.  But for reversible staining, and for stainingall common membrane types as well as PAGE gels, Sigma's RPRO-Bdeserves a closer look.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Whither SeawaterDesalination?Great things have been predicted for seawater desalination in theU.S., but have more or less failed to materialize.  Gordon Leitnerof Leitner and Associates, Inc. (815 Shadow Lawn Dr., Elm Grove, WI53122; Tel: 414/782-5236) has explored the question of whatactually happened to this technology in Desalination [102, 199-207,1995].Installed seawater desalting capacity in the 50 states of the U.S.is currently 13 mgd.  Only 3 mgd is produced on a regular basis,with the rest of the installed capacity on standby.  This is aminuscule percentage of ambitious projections that were made 25years ago.  It is also well below the projections being made just3 years ago.The 1992 IDA Worldwide Desalting Plants inventory lists eightseawater desalting plants proposed projects within the continentallimits of the U.S. with a total capacity of 67 mgd.  Not one ofthese proposed plants is currently under active consideration as ofthis writing.  Another plant not included on the list was underactive consideration until early 1994, after which the project wasshelved.To begin with, Leitner says that the forecasts of 30 years ago, aswell as more recent forecasts, have been fraught with outsideinfluences that had a dynamic effect on the market place.  Whilethe changes in this small industry covered a longer span than thegrowth of the computer, they confirm a common truism-even thewisest sage could not have predicted the changes that haveoccurred.Water conservation and reuse were not given much consideration 35years ago.  The mindset of the U.S. in the 1960s was not thinkingof conservation.  The mindset changed.  During the most recent 5-year California drought, conservation and water management effortsare credited with reducing water delivery by 15% or more.  Thetreatment and recycling of municipal wastewater has increasedsignificantly over the past decade in California and in somecoastal states and will continue to do so.  There are more than 200reclamation facilities in California alone, treating over 400,000acre feet of municipal wastewater a year-about 5% of urbandeliveries.Leitner believes the U.S. will have municipal seawater desalinationplants only when the need is accurately demonstrated.  When thisoccurs, there is substantial evidence that an 80-100 mgd seawaterRO plant can be build in the U.S., and when operated in conjunctionwith a combined cycle electric power plant, will deliver water atthe plant site at a cost in the range of $2.00 per 1000 gallons(1994 dollars).In the author's opinion, there is less evidence that the largevertical tube multi-effect distillation plant being studied by theMetropolitan Water District of Southern California can do the same,but the work carried out to date suggests the efforts be continued.Leitner suggests that the industry needs to be alert toopportunities, in particular when privatization might lead the wayto lower costs.  In addition, industry must continue to search forinnovative ways to lower costs, including the effect of blendingwith other sources.  Municipalities interested in seawaterdesalination should be guided to an awareness that a watertransport pipeline is always too large when first installed andmost always too small in later years.With modular seawater desalination units, added construction can becarefully tuned to demand increases.  Industry needs to emphasizethat rates for conventional supplies will double this decade.Seawater desalination costs should hold steady with improvedtechnology.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Performance Isin the DesignAccording to Weir Westgarth, a leader in desalination technology,speaking at the IDA World Congress on desalination and waterservices in Abu Dhabi in November, RO seawater desalination plantscan perform successfully and reliably if designed conservativelyand operated properly.RO plants have been criticized for not meeting some customers'expectations, particularly in the Persian Gulf region.  RO has beenpromoted as having a lower capital cost than an equivalent capacitythermal plant.  Westgarth, presenting a paper co-authored by AlanLinstrum, Peter Nicoll, George Mulholland, and Tom Leith, said thatwhile first cost is important, other considerations have to betaken into account when assessing through life cost-particularlyreliability, design, operating costs, and the experience of theconsultant and desalination contractor.Environmental conditions are seldom considered in the case of RO,and this was cited as probably the most important aspect ofselection.  Ideally, small prototype pilot units should be built onall sites intended for large RO installations at least 1.5 yearsbefore the full size plant design is required.  This would be usedto test and optimize conventional pretreatment options to handlethe large swings in water quality that can occur in shallow, warmcoastal sea water. The performance of different membrane typesunder varying environmental conditions should be studied.A comparison carried out of MSF and RO technology concluded thatfor large multi-million gallon installations in the Gulf, thermalplants provide the best technology for combined power and waterschemes.  While RO has the lowest capital and operating costs,these types of plants in the Gulf are subject to some of the mostarduous feedwater conditions in the world-the MSF process is not sosusceptible to these conditions.More realistic replacement rates of membranes, based on actualoperational experience, should be considered when evaluatingproduct water costs at the early stages of the project. Realreplacement rates are a major factor influencing life costassessment.Westgarth concluded that both MSF and RO have a role to play inmeeting the future needs of customers for desalinated water.Looking at the pros and cons of both systems, the authors foundthat RO has a shorter construction period, initially lower capitalcosts, and more flexible operation.  MSF water was of a higherquality, was unaffected by suspended or biological matter, and thesystem became more efficient and productive in colder wintermonths.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Materials InfluenceAdsorptive FoulingThe hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of membrane materials havean important influence on the membrane flux reduction when treatingsolutions containing hydrophobic solutes.  Different methods ofmeasuring the hydrophobic properties of membranes have beenevaluated, with measurement of the contact angle being the mostcommonly used method.Journal of Membrane Science [108, 79-87,1995] reports on a study inwhich the flux reduction of eight membranes of approximately thesame cut-off, but of different materials, was determined andrelated to the contact angle by Catharine Jnsson and Ann-SofiJnsson of Lund University (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, P.O. Box124, S-221 00 Lund, Sweden).Low-molecular weight hydrophobic solutes, such as fatty acids,alcohols and alkanes, are found in many natural solutions treatedby ultrafiltration (UF).  Although the concentrations of thesesubstances are usually low, they can reduce the membrane fluxseverely. The flux of polysulfone membranes with a nominalmolecular weight cut-off more than 100 times greater than themolecular weight of the solute was significantly reduced whentreating an octanoic acid solution, and surfactants, many timessmaller than the membrane pores, were found to reduce the flux ofmicrofiltration membranes.The Jnssons found that the flux of the hydrophilic membrane wasonly marginally reduced, whereas the flux reduction of hydrophobicmembranes was significant.  Membranes of polyvinylidene fluoridehad the lowest flux reduction of the hydrophobic membranes.Differences between membranes of the same material(polyethersulfone), but from different manufacturers, wereobserved.  No relation was found between the flux reduction and thecontact angle of the membrane, the initial pure water flux or theretention of a hydrophilic macromolecule (PEG20).The pure water flux of two of the hydrophobic membranes increasedsignificantly during the experiments, whereas the pure water fluxof the other hydrophobic membranes decreased.  A membrane ofpolyaramide, with a contact angle of the same order of magnitude asthe other hydrophobic membranes, behaved as a hydrophilic membrane,with no influence on the flux at concentrations below thesolubility limit of the hydrophobic solute, but experienced themost severe flux decline of all the membranes included in theinvestigation at the solubility limit.Two modified membranes were included in the investigation.  Theflux reduction of the these membranes was not significantly lowerthan for the corresponding unmodified membranes of the samematerials.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Pall Researches theWet-Dry ReversiblePall Corp. (2200 Northern Blvd., East Hills, NY 11548; Tel:516/484-5400, Fax: 516/484-5228) has developed integrity-testable,wet-dry-reversible ultrafiltration membranes.  For the first time,ultrafiltration/diafiltration membranes are capable of excluding0.02 micron diameter, monodisperse, latex particles.  The membranescan be dried without loss of ultrafiltration properties. A rapid,reliable method for integrity testing membranes also has beendeveloped. The test has particular applicability to ultrafiltrationmembranes, although it may also be used for testing microfiltrationmembranes (U.S. Patent 5,480,554).Two general structural varieties of asymmetric, integrally-skinned,phase inversion UF membranes are known. The original and still mostcommonly encountered variety of UF membrane consists essentially ofa bilayer having a thin skin exhibiting what has been termed slit-like fissures or cracks, and a thick substructure containing a highconcentration of finger-like intrusions or macrovoids. Themacrovoids often extend from one surface to the other although theyare sometimes buried more deeply within the matrix. Ideally, anintegral skin covers the macrovoids, but in practice, some of theskin above the macrovoids may be cracked. Cracks break theintegrity of the skin and enable the passage of large particles.These membranes are supplied wetted with a pore supporting fluidsince they cannot tolerate full dryness without severe loss offiltration performance.Bacteriostats, which must be washed out of the membrane beforeusage, are often present in membranes that are supplied wet. Somemanufacturers indicate in their catalogs that a membrane is beingsupplied "dry," however, these membranes may contain humectantssuch as glycerol as a pore supporting fluid. As with bacteriostats,humectants must be removed from the membrane by soaking, flushingor by some other method that never permits the membrane to becomefully dried.The second general type of UF membrane purportedly producesintegrally-skinned membranes with macrovoid-free matrices byincreasing the viscosity of the casting solution through theaddition of water soluble viscosity enhancing polymeric additivessuch as PVP or PEG. These membranes exhibit a skin with a pore sizedistribution which is too broad to be integrity-tested because ofthe leaching of the polymeric additives during precipitation andwashing steps.These membranes can be supplied "dry" (i.e., no free liquidpresent), but contain high concentrations of residual PVP or PEG.Humectants such as glycerol, PVP, PEG and/or water and otherwetting fluids may act as plasticizers to diminish friability.These materials may also act as pore supporting fluids which ifremoved lead to cracks and other defects in the membrane skin.Because of the wide and large number of applications forultrafiltration membranes, considerable effort has been spent toimprove the effectiveness of such membranes, but to date, withlimited success. Many patents and articles have been publishedregarding the manufacture of ultrafiltration membranes, someclaiming them to be "defect-free," and some claiming them to bedryable, but the fact remains that no ultrafiltration membrane hasheretofore been produced that is both dryable and which is free ofdefects.In  the Pall testing method, referred to as the KUF method, thetest membrane is thoroughly wetted with a wetting liquid. Adisplacing liquid is placed in contact with one side of the wettedmembrane and increasing pressure is applied to the displacingliquid. The flow rate through the membrane is measured as afunction of the applied pressure.The displacing liquid is substantially insoluble in the wettingliquid and the interfacial tension between the two liquids is about10.0 dynes/cm or less. A plot of the flow rate of liquid, per unitarea of the membrane, through the membrane as a function of appliedpressure can be made and a straight line may be drawn through thesteep part of the resulting curve, using regression analysis, whichwill intersect the horizontal axis at a given pressure value, whichis then the KUF value.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Irradiation FormsBetter BioreactorScientists at NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX77058; Tel: 713/483-3809, Fax: 713/244-8452) have built an improvedbioreactor for growing mammalian cell cultures.  Such bioreactorscan be used to support the growth of dense volumes of mammaliancells by providing ample, well distributed flows of nutrientsolution with minimal turbulence.  Such gentle nonturbulent flowenvironments in the growth media are necessary because mammaliancells are relatively delicate and cannot withstand the shear forcespresent in turbulent flows.The new bioreactor, reports Glenn F. Spaulding, may be made frompolymers such as polystyrene or polypropylene by inexpensiveinjection molding or vacuum forming techniques.  Conventional unitsare machined and assembled using more expensive materials such aszirconium, stainless steel, acetal, and polycarbonate.  Thecylinder walls in the new bioreactor are typically one millimeter(mm) thick.  The pores are formed by rotating the vessel about itscylindrical axis by exposing it to a beam of neutrons, protons,electrons, or other particles.  The impinging particles drillstraight holes through both the inner and outer cylinder walls,forming pores with diameters of 5-20 microns located about 50microns apart.In a typical growth procedure, mammalian cells and beads, whichserve as a substrate on which the cells grow, are placed in thevessel.  Fresh culture medium is also injected and air bubbles areremoved to eliminate head space in the vessel.  The vessel is thenrotated until the beads and cells are uniformly distributed.Periodically during the growth process, half the medium is removedand replaced, and the proportion of glucose in the fresh solutionis gradually increased to meet the demands of the growing culture.The culture is removed when the cellular aggregates have grownlarge enough to be useful for research--usually 100-1,000 microns.Like other bioreactors developed for this purpose, the NASA productis cylindrical.  In operation, it is rotated slowly about itscylindrical axis in a horizontal position.  The new bioreactordiffers from its predecessors in the manner in which it suppliesoxygen to and removes waste gases from the cells and nutrientmedium.  In older units, this job is accomplished with the help ofpumps and the ancillary plumbing and rotating couplings, whichsupply pressurized air to cylindrical core perfusion membranes.The new bioreactor functions without any connected plumbing and canbe rotated on any standard laboratory bottle roller.The NASA bioreactor consists of integrally molded concentriccylinders with a connecting wall at one end and a tightly fittingcap at the other.  Syringe ports in the cap are used to introducenutrient medium and cells into the vessel and to remove excess airbubbles and spent medium.  Small pores are in the inner and outercylinder walls and form membranes which permit oxygen to diffuseinto the vessel and waste gases to diffuse out.  The pores aresmall enough, though, to prevent the nutrient medium and cells fromleaking out.  The effective surface area of the membranes in thenew units is 2-10 times as large as in the older units.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Toray CreatesAntithromboticResearchers at Toray Industries (2-1, Nihonbashi-Muromachi 2-chome,Chuo-ku, Tokyo 130 Japan) have synthesized a hydrophilic materialand a formed a semipermeable membrane from that material (U.S.Patent 5,480,953).When membranes are used for medical care and brought into contactwith blood or body fluid, their components such as platelets,leucocytes, erythrocytes and fibroblasts inevitably adhere, andthere are fears that these adhered components generate a thrombuson a surface of a membrane coming into contact with blood and thatthe components affect a complement. As a result, formation of athrombus or reduction of an immunity function is presumed to becaused.Various attempts to solve these difficulties have been made. Insynthesizing a hydrophilic copolymer containing a polyalkyleneoxide chain, copolymerized with an acrylic or methacrylic ester,the content of polyalkylene oxide in the copolymer can be too high,and there is a problem that the synthesized copolymer becomes a gelin spite of the kind of the acrylic or methacrylic ester used. Thegel can hardly be dissolved in a solvent. In such a case, it cannotbe used as a coating material and cannot be formed as a fiber or amembrane.Even if the content of polyalkylene oxide is low, a satisfactoryanti-fouling property and antithrombotic property have not beendemonstrated. Research to improve the gel structure, a polymer,which can be easily dissolved in a solvent, which has a high watercontent and which has a high affinity with acrylic ester ormethacrylic ester, was synthesized by copolymerizing an acrylicester or methacrylic ester, polyalkylene oxide and anothercopolymerizable component.The material developed is characterized as a copolymer composed ofa monomer with a polyalkylene oxide unit and a polymerizablecarbon-carbon double bond in its molecule, a methacrylic estermonomer or an acrylic ester monomer and a monomer with apolymerizable carbon-carbon double bond other than the first twomonomers, and the content of the monomer is not less than 5% byweight and not more than 90% by weight.The hydrophilic material can be dissolved in a solvent and hasexcellent antithrombotic and anti-fouling properties, and providesan antithrombotic semipermeable membrane. These materials can beappropriately used in the medical field and as water-absorbent andanti-fouling materials.Back to Headline List CopyrightMEMBRANE & SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996BOOKSPrinciples andApplicationsThe field of membrane separation technology is in a state of rapidgrowth and innovation.

Now, with the help of Toronto-based planner Ken Greenberg, thecity is implementing many of the Institute's plans. ``Every city needs asense of a whole, how things connect to create a community,'' says MayorKen Coleman, ``and Catherine and Bill have provided that.''Morrish and Brown start their investigations with the land itself.Specifically, the focus on watersheds, not only because they believedevelopment patterns follow the rivers, knotting together around crossings,portages, or ports, but also because the flow of water maps aspects of thegeography that otherwise might not be noticed. In the Minne-apolis-St. Paul area, the city established itself at the last navigablepoint of the Mississippi. Neighborhoods developed first on bluffs, and thenby tracing the alluvial fans of creeks draining into the river. The floodplains were taken over by industry, and cuts in the bluffs became corridorsfor trains and, later, cars and trucks.The first task of any urban design, Brown and Morrish point out, is torediscover and re-use these patterns on an urban scale. Thus as the``industrial glacier'' that traced the flood plains created by the realglaciers recedes, they want to turn the resulting flat plains intocombinations of ``clean'' industrial parks and green zones, allowing thenatural hydrology of the area to shape the development. The natural routesalong the bluffs, which birds trace in their flight pattern overhead, werealready converted into a system of parkways according to a 1917 plan byWilliam Bennett, and Brown and Morrish want to finish its missing links.The problem for downtown St. Paul is its immediate relation to the river.As in many other cities, highway development in the 1960s cut off the cityfrom its shore. Thus, cars replaced boats along the river corridor, andtiered parking garages badly mimicked the bluffs. To Greenberg, thissituation becomes an excuse for an ``urban terrace'' such as the ones inQuebec City or Brooklyn Heights. In the future, landscaped stairs andescalators will connect a series of new cultural institutions, such as aScience Museum currently under construction, to a river front where a$500-million flood-control project has created new walkways and park areas.He then envisions retractable canopies over these public spaces to replacethe ubiquitous and isolating skywalk system. A renovation of WabashaAvenue, currently underway, will link the State Capitol through downtown toa thriving Hispanic community on the opposite bank of the river. ``What wedo is to connect buildings. Instead of the cult of the isolated project, welink neighborhoods,'' Greenberg explains.Though some of these projects resemble traditional urban-planningsolutions, Brown and Morrish point out that they are part of a largerreading of the region. They think it is not just a question of revitalizingdowntown or creating parks, but of figuring out what to do with the ``mushycontext'' of the concentric rings of suburbs the city is producing out inthe prairie. In the Institute's newsletter and the group's consulting work,they have proposed ways that all of these communities could be linked bothto one another and to the natural terrain to foster a sense of reality.``The first thing you need,'' says Morrish, ``is a common language. It'snot as much about land use as it is about reading the land.'' By focusingon ``topography, not typology,'' they hope to ``inflect social andgeographic systems to make them work better together.''In St. Paul, this means creating maps of the city that have made it legibleto the various neighborhoods and pressure groups that shape the politicallandscape. ``The main thing they have achieved,'' says Patrick Seeb,executive director of the non-profit St. Paul Riverfront Corporation, ``isto let people see the vitality of St. Paul. Their maps act as catalyststhat bring people `around the table' who weren't there.'' The result is aplan of connections rather than isolated development schemes.``They lay out the environment,'' says Mayor Coleman, ``and then we canmarket that.'' St. Paul, he hopes, will emerge out of Minneapolis' shadowto become a ``big small town'' embedded in a network of small townsconnected by the river and its watershed. Out of that fertile plain willcome rational development and a better place to live. As the Mayor puts it:``Cities are places people have in common.''Illustration(s):Illustration: One Photograph and One Map: St. Paul's central MississippiRiver valley (top) and proposed land uses (below).

KlimentOne of the more bizarre dramas to hit the political scene in years isplaying itself out at this writing in Washington, D.C. Chairman Bill Archerof the House Ways and Means Committee, miffed at a proposal by Democrats inthe last Congress to give permanent status to the Low Income Housing TaxCredit (LIHTC) program--it's a part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act--but to denyit to a parallel R&D program, persuaded both the House and a jointSenate-House conference committee to sunset the program after 1997.Sunsetting is a term that has emerged in recent years to ensure thatprograms no longer deemed viable are ended. Currently the LIHTC program issubject to year-to-year funding, an inefficient process that defieslong-term planning.In this case, there's a tragedy in the making. LIHTC is the only existinghousing support program to have made a dent in the dire shortage of housingfor low-income families. Producing over 100,000 units a year, it is thelargest driver of new and renovated low- and moderate-income housing in thenation, pouring some $320 million a year into state-administered programs.It provides 20 per cent of all multi-family housing, revitalizescommunities by involving them in the planning process, createsopportunities for architects, provides construction jobs, and generates newbusinesses in the community. And it's virtually the only game in town. (Seethis month's Building Types Study on affordable housing, beginning on page86).It works like this. To build housing at below-market cost, developers needto borrow capital at an affordable rate. Investors provide the capital,receive tax credits under the program for 10 years on any profits theymake, and write-offs for passive real estate losses for another five,promising them a tidy return over the 15 years, after which they can sellthe housing. The reduced costs are passed on to the tenant families in theform of lower rents.The idea of a housing safety net provided by government has gone though arange of scenarios since it was launched in the 1930s, tacking past thetricky political shoals pitting social sensitivity against ruggedself-reliance, homeownership against rent support, project-based supportagainst tenant-based support. The scenario for the 1990s is the tax-creditthat motivates investors to help provide housing at affordable rents.Architects have both a business interest and a social interest inpreserving the pro-gram. Without getting into the recondite byways offederal legislation, the bottom line is that the program, to receive funds,needs to get into an approved ``reconciliation bill,'' an instrument thatmatches expenditures and tax provisions against budgets. That's thechallenge now on the table. Both political parties by and large agree thatit's the most efficient, productive program at work. Everyone gains--thecommunity, the family, the investor, and the construction industry.As AIA's director of federal legislative affairs, Al Eisenberg, toldRECORD, ``There's no reason for this program to be in jeopardy.'' Let'skeep it alive.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. THE MARKET'S BUYING GREENEnvironmental Home Programs showcasing energy-efficiency andecological-design strategies are sprouting all over the country.Their success certifies green design's market appeal.By:By Elena Marcheso MorenoBuilding green is becoming big business, particularly for the housingindustry where individual homeowners have the opportunity to make choices.Given the vast size of the residential-building market, the potential isstaggering. In one year the energy demands of a single home release tons ofCO2 into the atmosphere, according to Elena Cotton Westbrook, anenvironmental consultant in Garland, Tex. ``When you consider the capitalresources, transportation, delivery, and related systems required toproduce this much energy, you can see that reducing home-energy needs willcreate significant environmental benefits across the spectrum,'' saysWestbrook, who, along with her mechanical-engineer husband, Paul Westbrook,is building an eco-house.Energy is just one element of ecologically sensitive design, but buildersand architects across the nation are jumping onto the bandwagon. For themost part, these houses offer real improvement over conventionally designedand built houses. Besides using less energy, they incorporate recycled orre-used materials, and if not bow, at least nod to the native landscape.It's important that significant segments of the housing industry arepromoting the premise that a sustainable society is not only possible, butnecessary. And most Americans are willing to wear the green hat of anenvironmentalist if they feel they can afford it.But it's not all about making the earth a better place. Theindoor-air-quality problems of existing construction practice are alsodriving the eco-home movement. As synthetic furnishings, fabrics,chemicals, finishes, and materials have become more prevalent, toxicoutgassing of common building materials has taken on a higher profile,exacerbated by energy-conserving tight construction when provision of freshair isn't handled properly.Models of sustainabilitySponsored by the government agencies, local non-profit groups,manufacturers, and utilities, a number of sustainable-housing demonstrationprojects are appearing around the country.Every Canadian province has participated in the Advanced House programbeing conducted in Canada by CANMET, the research and development arm ofEnergy, Mines and Resources Canada. With 10 houses built to suit variousclimates, the program has been recognized for its use of recycled products,energy efficiency, and appeal to the mass suburban market. One house isnoteworthy for its treatment of construction site waste. EnermodalEngineering Ltd., Ontario, incorporated such shop-made components as precutroof trusses, floor joists, and I-joists for wall studs into the house itdesigned and built. Many waste products--particularly plastic--were sold toa recycler. Steve Carpenter of Enermodal says construction generated only atrash can full of debris.The Center for Resourceful Building Technology (CRBT) in Missoula, Mont.,has completed its second eco-house, a tiny (965-sq-ft) urban-infillproject. This Timber Tech project was designed to be replicated. ``We choseresource-efficient and recycled materials that are currently available toshow builders and homeowners that they can improve the resource efficiencyof their construction right now,'' says Tracy Mumma, CRBT ResearchDirector. Inspired by an earlier CRBT project, architect Kate S. Warner hascompleted ``a traditional New England house'' in Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,using alternate materials and energy-efficient construction (below).The house is not a solar collector   What does it mean to build a green house? First and foremost it meansproviding more energy-efficiency. How much more depends on the builder andthe client.Nearly all architects and builders legitimately involved in the eco-housemovement create energy-conserving homes. It is no longer difficult orrisky. People want homes that use less energy and cost less to operate.Builders have the technology readily available--technology that has beenaround since the 1970s and 1980s when passive solar was aggressivelypromoted, only to be pushed aside by the public for its unconventional andoften unappealing designs.But passive-solar strategies and their attendant energy-conservationmeasures are in fact major components of any house that purports to beenvironmentally sensitive. Careful attention to building orientation,direct heat gain, daylighting, shading, and well-insulated construction allcontribute to low energy consumption. The difference now is that mostdesigners create houses that look like houses, not like the result of anaerospace experiment gone wrong.The problems that plagued early passive-solar homes--lack of fresh air andoutgassing of materials--are being conquered in today's green buildingsthrough the use of forced fresh-air ventilation (with heat exchangers,where warranted) and other measures that precondition outside air.The house of green components   While low energy use is a critical factor, it alone does not make ahouse green. Products and materials that create less environmental impactare also called for. Everything from the use of site-lumber scrap toshredded-plastic Coke bottles are appearing in the eco-house.Not all products are equally green. ``The way we look at it, everyenvironmental product and every eco-house advertised is a different shadeof green,'' says architect Greg Franta, of ENSAR Group, Boulder, Colo. Along-time researcher into energy conservation and environmental issuesrelated to buildings, Franta regularly designs green buildings. Even withhis expertise, it isn't always easy to decide if one product is better thananother. Franta, like many environmental advocates, advises a ``cradle tocradle'' analysis of products that considers the acquisition of the rawmaterials; the processing and manufacturing process; the packaging anddistribution impacts; the installation, use and maintenance issues; and thepotential for disposal, reuse, or recycling.Unfortunately, this is still not an easy task. Though numerous voluntaryand local certification programs exist, there is yet no widely acceptedcertification system, database, or standard for what makes products green[RECORD, October 1991, pages 36-39], though the Home Energy Rating SystemsCouncil is working on voluntary efficiency guidelines (202/638-3700). LikeFranta, Mike Nicklas of Innovative Design, Raleigh, N.C., is an architectwho has devoted his practice to designing energy-conserving buildings. Hehired an engineer to spend two years in his office researching variousbuilding products and materials and rate them in terms of their effect onthe environment.``The problem with our list is that it tends to be subjective,'' Nicklassays. ``We try to get a good picture of the total embodied energy in a newor recycled green product. We weigh the cost compared to other options.But, ultimately, the decision to use a product or not rests with theclient.'' While the price of a few green products is actually lower thanconventional ones, others demand a premium, and others become moreaffordable as the demand for them increases, explains Nicklas. In designinga demonstration house for Ari-zona Public Utilities, Jones Studios weighed``the quality of support by the company--the product most likely to bereadily available in the future and have strong backing from a stablecompany.''Widely used green productsFraming: Eco-houses are moving the home-building industry quickly away fromconventional timber (much of it from endangered old-growth forests) to avariety of framing and panel products that use more abundant wood speciesand incorporate material that was once scrap. Some designers are choosinglight-gauge steel framing, which can incorporate considerable recycledcontent. Both have their pluses and minuses [RECORD, September 1995, pages36-41].Insulation: One of the most successful products is 100-percentrecycled-newspaper cellulose insulation. Ground into a paste-like pulp, thecellulose is blown into walls and ceiling spaces. Its manufacture isrelatively benign. Indeed, even the ink gets recycled, points outenvironmental and construction technology consultant David Johnston ofWhat's Working, Boulder, Colo.Expanded-polystyrene rigid-foam insulation gets high marks from greenbuilders and designers because it doesn't involve ozone-depleting CFCs oreven the far superior but still ozone-depleting HCFC blowing agent. [Formore on insulation, see RECORD, April 1994, pages 34-35].Finishes: Recycled plastic bags and hardwood fibers collected fromfurniture waste and chopped-up building pallets are combined in anenvironmentally friendly decking material, says Johnston. In addition tobeing resource efficient, it can be softened and reformed. It will outlastlumber used in the same application by a few decades. Carpeting made fromrecycled PET plastic--the type used for water, soda, and ketchupbottles--has also met with industry-wide approval. More than 100-millionyards have been laid in buildings to date, says Johnston. ``It is morestain-resistant than nylon and wears better.''Perhaps the most readily embraced green building product in housing hasbeen low-VOC paints. When first introduced, low-VOC paints cost upwards of$30 per gallon. But once competition entered the market, prices were drivendown. It is selling in some states for about $17 per gal. to the trade. Newno-VOC paints are just entering the market.Alternative products are being investigated or developed by manufacturersof almost every type of building material and finish. One of the mostencouraging aspects of the push toward greener buildings is that a num-berof architects are experimenting with materials development. David Hertz ofSyndesis, Santa Monica, Calif., developed Syndecrete, a cement-basedcompound that uses recycled materials as its primary ingredients(opposite).Despite the availability of increasingly reliable green products, Johnstonsays that there's too much broad-brushed, marketing-driven green-washing bytoo many in the homebuilding industry. ``A lot of builders will put up ahouse with only one-half air change per hour, bad or non-existent energyconservation, and materials that outgas toxins, yet incorporate low-VOCpaint and feel justified in calling it environmentally responsive or green.The problem for the whole industry is that home buyers often don't knowwhat it is they don't know.''In response, Johnston worked with the Colorado Home Builders Associationto establish the ``Green Builders Certification'' program--one of a numberof local certification programs that have recently developed.IAQ vs energy efficiency   If we learned nothing else from earlier waves of environmental andenergy-conserving design, it's that an approach that simply layers greenconcepts or energy conservation onto conventional techniques can haveunintended consequences. The tightness of construction brought on by 70'senergy conservation is in part blamed for the indoor-air quality problemsof the 80's. Turning from wood studs to metal, warns Jim White of theCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Ottawa, can cause mold growth, forexample. Writing in Environmental Building News, he claims the thermalbridge created by a steel stud not fully enclosed by insulation can createcold spots where high humidity from kitchens or bathrooms can condense,encouraging mold growth within just a few months. In hot and humid regions,mold grows within improperly designed walls when air-conditioned rooms drawin outside air and airborne moisture condenses within the wall.With most Americans spending up to 90 percent of their day inside theirhomes or work places, a focus of eco-home design has become the conditionof the indoor environment. Rick Carter, of LBH Engineers and Architects,Minneapolis, designed an eco-house for a client with multiple chemicalsensitivities. Although it had to be tailored to the specific clients'sensitivities (page 014a), many of the strategies are finding their wayinto the broader market.Carter also designed the Minneapolis American Lung Association's HealthHouse, which is concerned with the increasing prevalence of asthma, whichit links to indoor-air quality. To eliminate pollutants, LBH minimizedmaterials that offgas toxics, including paint and carpet. It isolatespollution sources by, for example, separating the garage from the house andwrapping medium-density fiberboard in cabinets with plastic laminate. Thehouse is mechanically ventilated using 100-percent outside air (heatexchangers capture heat and cooling from waste air). Still, it suffers fromits location amidst a suburban development. Original landscape plans calledfor native plantings, but lost out to the developer's standard sod andimported trees.Looking at the bigger picture   The limitations that Carter's site imposed are typical of the problemsmany programs suffer--the inability to look at issues at a scale largerthan a single house. Yet a more holistic strategy, taking on site andcommunity-planning issues, is key to environmental sustainability.One project that takes a broader view is the Arizona Public Service CompanyEnvironmental Showcase Home in Phoenix, which was co-sponsored by EPA,Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, and the Home BuildersAssociation of Central Arizona. Designed by Phoenix architect Jones Studio,the project uses eco components like engineered wood and metal studs (oninterior walls). But it also uses shading and orientation, daylighting andlandscape concepts (previous pages).From site planning to town planning   Some communities are giving environmental mitigation high priority,attempting to counteract the effects of suburban life built around the useof the automobile. ``Pedestrian pocket'' and other traditional-developmentstrategies that emphasize transit use are already well known. Florida nowencourages compact development to reduce impacts on the state's endangeredEverglades. Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann architects, Washington D.C., havegone so far as to banish the auto in the master plan the firm developed forDeWees Island, S.C., a private, oceanfront retreat dedicated toenvironmental preservation (below and opposite).Many Americans seek a rural lifestyle, but the typical large-lot zoning inresort and exurban areas encourages polluting car trips and fragments thenatural landscape. Environmental advocates say such broken-up natural areasare less ecologically viable and more vulnerable to pests.Loudon County, Va., decided to follow the advice of architect and plannerRichard Calderon, Leesburg, Va., to help preserve the rural quality of itscommunity. As an alternative to its three-acre lot zoning, the county hasapproved a plan that allows hamlet developments. Houses in these hamletscan be closely clustered on less than 20 percent of the site, leaving therest of the land in its natural state. They also encourage a moreneighborly form of country living. So encouraging is Loudon County'senvironmental policy, that several developers are constructingeco-villages. Franta of ENSAR is designing one hamlet of environmentallyoriented houses; Bethesda, Md.-based Hillier Reed and Neal Payton,Washington, D.C., are doing another (below) that includesnarrower-than-standard streets to slow traffic.Defining and assessing the environmental considerations that make a housegreen remain complex. The key, say Alex Wilson and Nadav Malin, editors ofEnvironmental Building News, is to set priorities (RR1, Box 161,Brattleboro, VT 05301, 802/257-7300). Their October 1995 issue offers achecklist far less formidable for the smaller firm than the bible ofsustainability, AIA's Environmental Resource Guide (now published andupdated by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 800/225-5945). See ManufacturersResources in this issue for additional information about the projectsmentioned in this story.Illustration(s):Illustration: Two Photographs, One Illustration and One Plan: Affordableregional style   Dallas builder Barbara Harwood of BBH Enterprises markets ``affordable''eco homes. Esperanza del Sol (bottom) comprises two rows of six 1,270-sq-fthouses clustered around a shared green space. Each three-bedroom, two-bathhouse is insulated (with cellulose) far in excess of Dallas' standardpractice. Lumber use was minimized by framing 24-in. o.c. with 2 by 6studs. Natural ventilation, roof overhangs, and daylighting all contributeto Harwood's confidence that her $79,000 homes won't cost more than $300 ayear to heat and cool. She even offers to guarantee it. Architect KateWarner's educational efforts around ReCraft East (right) focus on thenumerous alternative products this traditional-looking house contains--fromfly ash in the concrete to salvaged-wood flooring, and beer-barrel stavecabinets.Illustration: One Photograph and One Plan: Form follows fresh air   David Hertz, of Syndesis, Santa Monica, Calif., not only developedSyndecrete (a cement-based compound that uses recycled materials as itsprimary ingredients), he'll use it for various surfaces at the Lehrer house(right). The house also incorporates numerous other environmentallypreferable alternative products--from recycled rigid-board insulation tonails with recycled content. Since carpet is avoided, an efficientradiant-heating system is installed in the floors. Low-flow andwater-conserving plumbing fixtures are specified.He uses architectural form to focus prevailing breezes. A tower-likeelement draws hot air up, exhausting it in the summer and recycling it(through a heat-recovery unit) in the winter. The hvac has an advancedcontrol system that allows more effective zoning of heating and coolingthroughout the house.Illustration: One Photograph and One Plan: An environmental island   Charged with minimizing environmental impact at DeWees Island, S.C.,Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann limited development to 150 homes (right) andbanished petroleum-fueled cars in favor of electric golf carts (no golfcourse is allowed, though). Sand paths replace roads.All house designs must be approved by an architectural review board, whichencourages regional architectural devices such as wide overhangs andwrap-around porches. Structures are mounted on pilings, reducing impact onflora and fauna, and permitting hurricane-driven storm surges to passharmlessly underneath. Only five percent of the island can be built upon,and housing must be clustered in the maritime forest on the southwestcorner of the island (lower left in plan).Conservation of water is encouraged, fertilizers discouraged, and use ofrecycled building products required. The Reeves residence, a house thatmeets all of these criteria, was recently completed by North Carolinaarchitect Design Harmony (opposite left).Illustration: Two Photographs and One Plan: An environmental hamlet   Sunnyslope, in Loudon County, Va., is a ``hamlet'' plan posed as analternative to the kind of large-lot development that encourages trafficproblems in rural and exurban areas. Bill Reed of Hillier Reed, Bethesda,Md., and Neal Payton, Washington, D.C., have clustered 30 homes (whichfollow their own environmental guidelines), leaving much of the site's 150acres unencumbered. Following traditional neighborhood developmentprecedents, the hamlet's streets are designed more like country lanes. Acommunity building and a town green offer a civic focus.Photograph(s):Photograph: Four Photographs: It looks like home   The Tamarack Point subdivision, near Colorado Springs, is similar tomany green building programs in that it incorporates many alternativeproducts (engineered wood, recycled-plastic carpet) while sticking close towhat competitors offer in terms of design and price (1, 2 right). Themodels are built by Habitat Design and Construction.Indoor-air-quality issues merited special attention in a Minnesota housefor a client with chemical sensitivities, designed by LBH Engineers andArchitects (3, 4). After the firm researched products, ``the clientactually took materials to the doctor and tested each one,'' says RickCarter of LBH. ``Sometimes we had to construct a sample because itcontained a composite material, or something had to be painted andtested.''Tile was used instead of carpet; the detached garage minimizes infiltrationof carbon-monoxide; slab-on-grade construction avoided mold-growth from abasement. The architects even provided doors with large glass areas becausethe client is sensitive to softwoods.Photograph: Three Photographs: Considering climate and landscape   The showcase house Jones Studio designed for Arizona Public Service (anelectrical utility) goes well beyond those eco-homes that merely substituteproducts within a conventional envelope. It's oriented so that thickmasonry walls will absorb Phoenix's fierce direct thermal gain. (They areinsulated with polyurethane foamed without CFCs.) Expressive overhangscatch breezes and shade the interior from direct sun, while permittinguseful daylight (kitchen and ``great'' room with den beyond--2).Through such techniques, reliance on energy from fossil fuels is reducedfar beyond the norm. The building envelope saves 30 percent of the energyused in a typical new energy-efficient house, and is insulated far inexcess of standard practice. The number of windows on east-west exposureswas minimized to enhance energy efficiency; north- and south-facing windowsare grouped to provide plenty of daylight and views. Ecological strategiesextend to the outside. Natural desert plants were used to reduce landscapewater needs, and subsurface irrigation reduces loss of water byevaporation. Rainwater combined with household gray water is collected forall landscape watering.About the Author(s):Elena Marcheso Moreno, based in McLean, Va., writes on architecture andarchitectural technology.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. INTRODUCTIONBy:Karen D. SteinTrying, as correspondent Beth Dunlop reports, to turn ``fiction intofact,'' the Walt Disney Company has embarked on an ambitious program toinvent a town that resembles one of its own moving-picture fantasies ofAmerican small-town life--Norman Rockwell writ large. Located near Orlando,Florida, and that ultimate destination spot, Walt Disney World, thefeel-good-named town of Celebration is literally on the rise, with a masterplan by Robert A.M. Stern Architects and Cooper Robertson & Partners andmajor downtown buildings by an all star-cast of architects: a Whitman'sSampler of design (pages 64-69). The first completed project in Celebrationis an office complex by Aldo Rossi of Italy, his first building in the U.S.(pages 56-63).While the impressive array of planners and architects has tackled issues ofmodest-price housing in Celebration, this month's Building Types Study(Number 733) on affordable housing presents an even tougher reality, whereamenity, cost-efficiency, and design sensitivity are in a constantthree-way tug-of-war (pages 86-95).Sensitivity to an existing and beloved historical context--one that, asAaron Betsky writes, is ``an inspired merger of monastery and MissionStyle''--is a recurring theme on the growing campus of Stanford Universityand one that San Francisco firm Tanner Leddy Maytum Stacy managed toaddress while producing a truly Modern addition to the school's engineeringdepartment (pages 70-75), also paving the way for Norman Foster'scompetition win of a medical building last month. The evolution of adifferent kind of campus has been the long-time preoccupation of Frencharchitect Paul Andreu, who for 30 years has helped guide the developmentand expansion of the Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris (pages 76-85).His goal has been to avoid what he calls ``the tendency in Modernarchitecture for a building to have just one unifying concept.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. THE CROSSROADS OF FRANCEThe Exchange Module is the heart of one of the most sophisticatedtransportation hubs in the world.By:Claire DowneyThe intersection of a high-speed rail line, airport, and urban transitsystem occurs at the new Exchange Module at France's Charles de GaulleAirport. Opened in 1994, the module serves the recently built perimeter TGV(trains grande vitesse) line skirting eastern Paris. Built to circumventlengthy connections from one inner-city station to another, the new line,and its airport link, renew Paris's competitive edge as an internationaltransportation center.The exchange module is really two projects in one--a train station, plusthe multi-level pedestrianway--and is the latest but certainly not the lastelement in French architect Paul Andreu's collaboration with the Aeroportsde Paris. Andreu has designed the entire Charles de Gaulle Airport, and hisnew project creates a point of relief in its masterplan. The module usesdramatic structural design to create unencumbered circulation and, althoughmonumental, there is a quality of light and weightlessness about it thatcontrasts with the density of its concrete neighbors.For this latest project, Andreu renewed his collaboration with the engineerPeter Rice (who died in 1992), and Rice's Paris office, RFR. Through shareddiscussions, Andreu and Rice conceived of a space that would stay away``from the simplistic idea,'' or as Andreu explains, ``the tendency inmodern architecture for a building to have just one unifying concept.''Instead, the elliptical 260-room hotel extends the existing poured-concretearchitectural language of Terminal 2--the transparency of the hotel'satrium becomes a skylight for the exchange terminal--and is an elegantcounterpoint for the transparency of the train station. The linkage wassimplified by the design of the air terminal itself. In plan, Terminal 2resembles an elongated figure-eight. In choosing the narrow juncturebetween existing segments and the future loop of Terminal 3, Andreuunderlaid the perpendicular axis of the 1,600-foot-long train station.The winged glass roofs of the train platforms are, from every angle, thefocus of the project. Andreu wanted the roof to appear to float, and hewanted users to be able to see out and be bathed in light. RFR developed acantilevered tubular-support structure, which is quite dense. The visualcomplexity is diminished by the design of distinct, readable layers. ``Itwas part of Rice's concept,'' explains RFR project director Hugh Dutton,``to establish a hierarchy, with each element having its own identity.''The sweep of the roof unifies the complex human movements within.Passengers transfer from commuter-rail lines to plane, plane to train, oreven Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. Each transport system occupies its ownlevel, and the openness of the scheme gives passengers a clear idea ofwhere they are and where they need to go. Its architecture, punctuated byescalators, seating, and banks of monitors, is almost a blank slate. Theeye is not drawn to the open interior space, but outward, either to theanimated roof of the train station, or the airplanes on the tarmac. Thefact that the glass train-station roofs slope up toward the hotel aboveallows a protected inside-outside view. Daylight enters from the north andsouth and, and at night, light levels are kept below the glare threshold sooften exceeded in transportation centers.The openness of the project helps alleviate stress by constantlyre-orienting passengers as they move through the Module. Andreu is againstall that clutters transportation spaces: advertising, piped-in music;anything that can be referred to as animation. Fortunately, he has includeda cafe and newspaper stand along with the train ticketing counter on Level2, since the TGV passes infrequently. In terms of train traffic, thesuburban train into Paris, whose four lines parallel the TGV, is moreimportant. Still, Andreu has preserved a sense of calm that almost allowsthis 216,000-square-foot building to seem intimate.CreditsExchange ModuleCharles de Gaulle AirportRoissy-en-FranceOwner: Aeroports de Paris; SNCFArchitect: Paul Andreu; Jean-Marie DuthilleulArchitecture and Construction Management: Dimitri Georgandelis, projectmanager; Michel Vermeulen, deputy project manager; Anne Brison, architect(Aeroports de Paris); Daniel Claris, project manager; Jol Nissou, SylvieGuillaume, Jean-Louis Salama, architects; Jacques Courvoisier, projectmanager (SNCF)Engineers: RFR--Peter Rice, partner-in-charge; Hugh Dutton, architect,project manager; Claire Mazelet, Henry Bardsley, Kate Purver, Guy Deshayes,engineers; Alexander Autin, David Holford, architectsIllustration(s):Illustration: Plan: A changing master plan   Charged with the master planning of the entire airport, as well as thearchitecture of its main buildings, Andreu was able to introduce anarchitecture for the train station that counterpoints the existing parts ofTerminal 2 and Terminal 3 (currently under construction).

For French architect Paul Andreu, the evolutionof Charles de Gaulle airport has been a 30-year preoccupation. As a youngengineering graduate still working on his architecture degree in the 1960s,Andreau took a job with the Aeroports de Paris (ADP) working on themasterplan of the new airport. By the time he was 29 and an architect, hewas designing the airport's first terminal. It was a chance he got throughluck, long hours and, he admits, by being a little competitive. The design,a segmented circle where passengers move through suspended transport tubes,became a symbol of late-Modern architecture. Coming from nowhere at a timewhen few French architects were interested in airport design, Andreu foundhimself in the spotlight, but also on the defensive: reviewers at the timewere unsure whether this was architecture or engineering. Isolated by thedebate, Andreau opted to stay on with ADP. Now that airport commissions areprized by the world's top architects, Andreu's positions with ADP isenviable. His career in transportation design has not only developedinternationally, but with the completion of the Grande Arche at La Defense(after the death of Johann Otto van Spreckelsen), one of Paris's grandsprojets, and his museum in Osaka, Japan, Andreu is finding a new audiencefor his architecture.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. DESIGNS ON THE FUTURE``The combination of celebrated architects with the less well-known (andthe corresponding combination of instant landmarks with modest vernacularbuildings) makes [Disney's new] town kind of a Columbus, Indiana, meetsColumbus, Georgia,'' writes Beth Dunlop.By:Beth DunlopOne sunny Saturday last November, a crowd gathered under a vast tent for anafternoon's entertainment. It wasn't a circus or a concert, but a lotterydrawing to determine who would be eligible to buy into the Walt DisneyCompany's new town, Celebration. Among the hopefuls, interestingly enough,were several top officials of the Disney Development Corporation (DDC).They had to take their chances just like everyone else; more than 3,500potential home-buyers were vying for one of Celebration's first 300 housesor apartments.Neo-traditional towns have been an important area of design and inquiryamong architects for the last decade. The first of these--notably, Seaside,Florida; Kentlands, Maryland; and Laguna West, California--have garneredtheir share of critical and popular admiration. Now Disney is building oneof its own. Despite its somewhat frivolous-sounding name, Celebration is aserious effort to grapple with ideas about the nature and future ofneighborhood, community, and town planning; and it is also an effort toshow that new development can be accountable to environmental andecological concerns. It is to be, in the words of DDC vice president forcommunity development, Don Killoren, ``sustainable and holistic.''Celebration reflects its creators aspirations. Disney CEO Michael Eisnerhopes that it will provide a ``prototype for the millennium'' by offeringquality of life and intellectual content in addition to practicalconveniences. Eisner pins great hopes on the school--a public experimentalkindergarten through twelfth-grade institution that incorporates ateacher-training academy--as a way to set the town apart. For his part, DDCpresident Peter Rummell wants Celebration to change the perception of thecompany as a pure entertainment conglomerate: ``It's going to be a placethat deals with real-world issues and real-world problems, but deals withthem in a relevant way.''A place called Celebration   Celebration sits just outside of the sprawling acreage known as WaltDisney World, near Orlando, Florida. Before embarking on this project, DDCgot the site formally removed from the Reedy Creek Improvement District(which provides everything ranging from electric power to police protectionto the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, MGM Studios, the water attractions, theoffices, the shopping complexes, and the hotels). Celebration isn't part ofthat Disney domain; instead, it is in Osceola County, which will providepublic services from sewers to schools. To build the town, Disney receivedthe most comprehensive development permit the state of Florida had everissued, says Tom Lewis, DDC's vice president for development.Eventually, the town will have 8,000 houses compactly arranged around a``downtown'' and more expected Florida-style amenities, such as a golfcourse and tennis courts; Disney is spending approximately $100 million oninfrastructure and development. Celebration encompasses just about 10,000acres, but of that only half is buildable. The rest is protected wetlands,and home to numerous protected animal and plant species. The town will haveeight miles of trails for hiking or biking, a model school with the latestin educational equipment, and a ``health campus'' that is both fitnesscenter and hospital. It already has its own zip code, Celebration, Florida,34747.In the role of master-planners Celebration's chief architects are RobertA.M. Stern and Jaquelin Robertson, who not only created the town plan, butare also carefully nurturing it into being. The plan itself is derived froma number of small-town sources, but it is also adapted to its boggytropical terrain. It springs, too, from a number of philosophical andpragmatic ideas about American town planning, from the sequence of spacesto the role of the backyard. Stern, who, not incidentally, is also a memberof the company's board of directors, and Robertson are shepherding thistown into being with such thoroughness that they have even had a hand inthe design of the light fixtures and street signs to be sure they ``sayCelebration,'' at least symbolically.Their design for Celebration is not, its authors say, ``ideological,'' butrather based on the idea that the best American towns are also, inRobertson's words, ``places people love to go to.'' Of course, Walt DisneyWorld is the most-visited place in the known universe, so Celebration has ahead start. To begin with, 27,000 visitors stopped in at the cleverlydesigned information center (by the graphics and design firm, Pentagram)within the first three months it was open.Crossbreeding, Celebration-style   The town will have compact neighborhoods and house designs drawn from ahost of recast historicist Southern regional styles. Robertson terms this``the crossbreeding of architecture styles in America.'' Modernism isnoticeably absent; Stern and Robertson believe that American small townslost their vitality after World War II. Maintains Robertson: ``Celebrationis really a kind of a testimony to that crossbreeding and our kind ofediting and selection of those town settings that we thought were mostsuccessful and most emblematic.''Celebration also boasts an exclusive, marquee-level cast of architects. Theplan from Stern and Robertson had early contributions by Duany andPlater-Zyberk Architects, and Gwathmey Siegel and Associates. The town hallwas designed by Philip Johnson. Next door will be a post office by MichaelGraves. Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown are designing the bank; CesarPelli & Associates, the cinema, and Graham Gund, a hotel. William Rawn hasdesigned Celebration's model school. The late Charles Moore designed thetown's ``preview center,'' and it is to be built posthumously. Robertson'sfirm, Cooper Robertson & Partners, is designing the town's golf clubhouse.Celebration's only completed structures--an office complex to house DDC,among other tenants--were designed by Aldo Rossi [see previous article].Adjacent to the Rossi complex will be the health campus, which Stern isdesigning. Stern and Robertson have each developed a number of other townbuildings, but the houses themselves will be done by many regionalarchitects, among them Derrick Smith and Lidia Abella of Miami; McCall andTurner of Moultrie, Ga.; John Robbins of Oxford, Miss.; Al Jones of BatonRouge; Historic Concepts, Inc. of Peachtree City, Ga.; and UDA ofPittsburgh. The combination of celebrated architects with the lesswell-known (and the corresponding combination of instant landmarks withmodest vernacular buildings) makes the town itself kind of a Columbus,Indiana, meets Columbus, Georgia.Celebration celebrates what its architects know best   From the beginning, Stern and Robertson were mindful of the admonitionthat architects, like writers, are at their best when their work is basedon what they know. Both Stern and Robertson, as New Yorkers, also haveweekend homes in the Long Island beach town of Easthampton, a place thatthey both admire greatly. ``Easthampton seemed to Robert and me to havealmost all of the touchstones of early American urbanism in its earliestphases and yet every practical issue was addressed in the plan,'' saidRobertson, convenience of observation notwithstanding.Disney's in-house architects, as well as Ray Gindroz from UDA and Stern andRobertson, in fact did visit numerous early American towns, many of them inthe South, as part of the extensive research done for Celebration over thepast decade. One young DDC employee--armed with a recent master's inarchitecture and a camera--was sent off to photograph every appealingbuilding or public space he could find in historic towns in the Southeast.Still, unlike early American town builders, Disney had a host of regulatoryissues as well as environmental and ecological considerations to grapplewith, from the preservation of wetlands that are home to such threatened orendangered species as the American bald eagle and the Florida gophertortoise to the saving of what Stern termed the ``significant trees'' onthe site. The saved trees gave the plan additional shape. In one spot,houses circle a cluster of trees left in place as a natural landmark. Eachof Celebration's neighborhoods, in fact, revolves around what Stern terms a``significant public space.''Charming and car-friendly   Some of those public spaces--in the downtown, for example--are fullyhospitable to cars. Unlike many quaint 19th-century towns with narrow,cobbled roads, Celebration's streets are engineered to accommodateautomobiles. Its neighborhoods are precisely arranged to offer walkingdistances (between homes and shops, homes and school), a recognition of alate 20th-century suburban culture in which people drive to the health clubto walk on a treadmill or take the elevator up to climb on the stairmaster. ``While we're all interested in traditional towns,'' says Stern,``this is a representation of that search to recapture the traditionaltown. We are all very mindful that this is being built at the end of the20th century, so the town is traditional in spirit but modern in terms ofwhat we know about how people live.''Thus, though outwardly Celebration will rely on a host of architectural andsymbolic gestures to the past, signs of being high-tech, in fact, abound.Each of its eventual 8,000 houses will be linked to the outside world (townhall, hospital, school) by an advanced fiber-optic system. The school (runjointly by Osceola County and Stetson University) is to get an infusion ofthe latest equipment and technology from Disney.The plan places special emphasis on returning streets and sidewalks to thepublic realm. The main street, called Water Street (Osceola County alreadyhad a ``Main Street'' and Celebration couldn't reuse the name), isconceived as a broad, tree-lined boulevard, ``the town stroll.'' Theperipheral road, called Golfpark Drive, has houses only on one side as inEasthampton, and the golf course is entirely visible from the road--makingit public green space, at least visually. Special attention was paid to thedesign of the 15-foot-wide sidewalks, which Stern calls ``the principlecomponent of the public realm.'' Stern and Robertson were adamant about theinclusion of alleys for a host of architectural and sociological reasons.Robertson likes to think of many of the town's elements--the golf coursewith no houses fronting on it or the alleys--as ``radical old notions'' oftown planning.The downtown is conceived as an old-fashioned town center, with acombination of commercial, office, and residential space. The town hall,post office, bank, and preview center are all intended as civic standouts,buildings that will be recognized by and, it is hoped, for theirarchitecture. Stern and Robertson are providing the fabric around thelandmarks: they essentially divvied up the rest of the downtown buildingshalf-and-half, and they are cloaked in the hybrid American style thatconjures up lots of non-specific memories. ``We predicated our design onthe notion that American towns had a life before the 1940s, basically, upuntil World War II, so the buildings take their inspiration up to the1940s,'' says Stern.Designing by the book   The architects and builders of Celebration's houses must work within theguidelines of a hefty and handsome ``pattern book,'' based on similar bookspublished in the early part of this century. Pittsburgh architect RayGindroz, of the firm Urban Design Associates, is its author. It delineatesthe basic elements of ``the Celebration house''--front facade, back yard,side wings, porches--and outlines the six architectural styles and possibleconfigurations allowed in the town's first phase. The styles are defined asClassical, Victorian, Colonial Revival, Coastal, Mediterranean, and French.The pattern book is a kit of parts in a way, with numerous potentialcombinations of roof profiles, finish materials, windows, and ornament.``Instead of telling people what they shouldn't do, we are telling peoplewhat they can do,'' said Gindroz.Some buyers at Celebration may bring in his their own architects, whileothers will choose from those offered by the developers. Everybody, though,must respect such rules as the height of the cornice line (``absolutelycritical in creating the quality of the public space,'' claims Gindroz) andthe placement of fences and hedges along the street. Although, Celebrationis a town in name, it will not immediately be self-governed (Disney willown most of the public space and all of the commercial buildings); thus,strict controls can be kept over paint colors, renovations, and even theplacement of screened porches and pool enclosures.A highway runs through it   Its site has a certain high visibility. It is just off Highway 192, thesoutherly approach to Walt Disney World and a road lined with everyimaginable (and some likely beyond easy imagining) fast-food restaurant,motel chain, souvenir shop, themed shopping center, and familyentertainment offering. Stern calls it ``the sleaze road of all times.''Rossi's rather sophisticated office complex sits along Highway 192, as willStern's hospital. After DDC had designated this off-site site forCelebration, the Florida Department of Transportation decided it needed torun a connector road through it, which will separate the town from theoffice complex and hospital. The addition of this road makes Celebration atonce more accessible to the outside world and less so, in that it will bedifficult to go on foot to and from the adjacent health facilities andoffice buildings. The new road is, at best, a mixed blessing and one thatgives Celebration a full-fledged late 20th-century pedigree, the new townby the expressway.Model town or company town?   And unlike many new housing developments, Celebration is not a gatedcommunity, nor is it oppressively expensive. ``Our emphasis,'' saysKilloren, ``is on diversity. We don't have distinctions between the havesand have-nots here.'' Indeed, at Celebration, the top-end lots (called``estate'' lots) are a stone's throw from the townhouses, which will sellfor prices ranging upwards of $120,000, and rental apartments downtown.Still, a criticism leveled by some is that even at that lowest price range,Celebration-living is out of reach for many of Disney's low-end employees.``It is not a cure-all,'' says Eisner. ``It's a way of trying to make atown.''Disney, for its part, is adamant about not letting this be a company town.The philosophical emphasis on diversity means more than just economic orethnic diversity, which is why employees had to take their chances in thelottery just like everybody else (a father of three, DDC's Killoren, forexample, drew number 97 in the estate lots lottery; another top DDCexecutive wanted a cottage lot and most likely won't get it on the firstround).The future resembles the past   All of Disney's theme-park environments--from the various ``lands'' andrides to the hotels--are somehow idealized. When Walt Disney designed thefirst Main Street for Disneyland in 1955, he said he was basing it on hishometown of Marcelline, Missouri, but Disney was idealizing theturn-of-the-century American small town main street, turning fact intofiction. A decade later, in the mid-1960s when Walt Disney was buying upCentral Florida swampland for his second theme park venture, his interestshad jumped from past to future. His goal was a futuristic model communityhe called EPCOT (originally, EPCOT was an acronym for ExperimentalPrototype Community of Tomorrow). Thus, while others were drawing up MainStreet and Cinderella's castle, he was thinking bigger thoughts aboutfinding a solution to urban chaos. He envisioned EPCOT sitting under abubble of glass, with high-speed monorails zipping residents of thishigh-tech town from home to work and back again--a sleek and hermetic worldof the future. Disney's idea died with him in 1966.But now we know the future is, at least partly, in the past and it's to befound at Celebration, not at EPCOT. Says Stern: ``Ironically, it is MainStreet [in the Magic Kingdom] that was the actual genius of Americanurbanism recaptured.'' Now Main Street, Disney-style, moves into themainstream in Celebration where, perhaps, the process will be reversed, andthe fiction and fantasy of small-town life will be turned back into fact.Illustration(s):Illustration: One Photograph and One Plan: A recent aerial photograph(above) shows downtown Celebration under construction.

Celebration, however, includes protected wetlands, whichwill give the town a permanent greenbelt (see master plan top).

Roughly half of its 10,000 acres is protected wetlands, whichcreates a greenbelt and allows for uninterrupted vistas through the trees.The plan focuses on a new lake, part of a system of canals and waterwaysthat provides for storm-water runoff and gives the town a visual focalpoint. The town center nests along the lakefront, and the residentialneighborhoods fan out from there. In Celebration's first phase ofconstruction, everyone will be within walking distance of the shops andrestaurants.A strongly hierarchical road system gives further definition: broadboulevards; narrower, winding roads; straight streets; back alleys;pedestrian walkways; and bicycle paths. At the periphery is Golfpark Drive,with houses on one side and rolling greens on the other--a device bothesthetic and democratic in intent. Leaving the golf course accessible givesCelebration a strongly defined open space so everyone--not just aprivileged few who can afford adjacent houses--gets the view. Another boldgesture in the plan is the broad boulevard that cuts a swath throughCelebration and is intended as the town's promenade. It is Water Street, areference to the stream that will run through its median strip.(Celebration had to take street names that were not already in use inOsceola County, which was no small task in the generally cutesy world thatis Orlando and its vicinity. Most were already in use, leaving the ratherold-fashioned Sycamore, Honeysuckle, Elderberry, and Mulberry.)Each residential neighborhood focuses on a special spatial feature: acircle, a square, a protected strand of trees, or the waterway. Thesefeatures, in turn, give shape and character to their neighborhoods and, saythe architects, definition and subtlety to the plan.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. DOWNTOWN CELEBRATIONBy:Beth DunlopDowntown Celebration is intended as a place to live, work, shop, eat, andplay. It is also conceived as an ode to late 20th-century architecture: itsprimary buildings have been designed by architects who achieved fame in the1970s and 80's. It includes a town hall by Philip Johnson, a post office byMichael Graves, a bank by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, a cinemaby Cesar Pelli, and a ``preview center'' by the late Charles Moore. Most ofthe other downtown buildings are by the firms of Celebration's chiefplanners Robert A.M. Stern and Jaquelin Robertson. An inn, not in the firstphase, is by Graham Gund.The all-star lineup was the brainchild of Disney's chief architect WingChao. He told Disney CEO Michael Eisner and DDC president Peter Rummellthat since the town would be in the spotlight ``we needed an all-star teamfor our first line-up, if you'll forgive the football analogy.'' Eisnersays he ``loved the idea of having us challenged by others on the outsideand being pushed to excellence''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODSBy:Beth DunlopCelebration's residential structures are governed by a hefty, 74-page,portfolio-size ``pattern book,'' based on similar guidelines publishedearly in the century. The book is largely the work of Ray Gindroz of thePittsburgh firm, Urban Design Associates, in association with DisneyDevelopment Corporation, Robert A.M. Stern Architects, and Cooper Robertson& Partners.The pattern book is not simply a blueprint. It sets forth thephilosophical, historical, and architectural premises that inspiredCelebration and establishes some basic principles and definitions to guideall development.A number of elements of the town are strictly controlled, among them thebuilding massing, the placement of side wings and porches, the height ofthe cornice line. The urbanism of Celebration depends on the relationshipof house and yard (bounded by a fence or hedge) to the sidewalk. Thepattern book prescribes this relationship to create a clear distinctionbetween the private, domestic realm of the house and the public realm ofstreets, sidewalks, and squares.Celebration will have six accepted building styles--Classical, Victorian,Colonial Revival, Coastal (a melding of French Colonial and ``low country''architectural traditions), Mediterranean, and French. The styles are drawnfrom Southern domestic and vernacular architecture, and are the result ofstudying such towns as Charleston, Beaufort, and Mount Pleasant, S.C. Earlybuyers seemed to favor the Coastal house, with its wraparound porches, andthe somewhat grander Classical models.Celebration's houses will not necessarily be true styles, letter- perfectin their authenticity. Rather, they will be composites of those typicallyfound in small-town neighborhoods that have evolved over the years, thoughthe pattern book carefully lays out mandatory ``key elements'' andappropriate detailing for each style. Within this are endless combinationsof windows and doors, porches, and loggias.To add to the mix, there are four basic sizes of Celebration lots:``estate'' (though presiding over lots typically 90 by 130 feet and not, asthe name suggests, vast rolling acreage), ``village'' (to accommodate aregular house), ``cottage'' (for a slightly smaller ``empty nest'' or``starter'' house) and ``townhouse.''The pattern book also spells out acceptable materials, which intentionallydiffer somewhat among the styles to provide texture to each neighborhood.There is also a palette of approved Celebration paint colors and a guide topreferred plants and trees. All of this is aimed at achieving the trickybalance of making Celebration seem at once coherent and diverse, as if thetown simply grew all on its own.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. PLACE MAKINGAldo Rossi gives monumental presence to Disney's development company,creator of the new Florida town of CelebrationBy:Karen D. SteinCentral Florida's flat sawgrass-rimmed landscape in no way suggests theItalian town of Pisa, except to the mind of Aldo Rossi, whose leap ofimagination has linked them in spirit, giving this instant town an instantlandmark. The plan of Rossi's office complex, the first project to be builtin the Walt Disney Company-sponsored new town of Celebration, was inspiredby Pisa's main square, the Piazza dei Miracoli or ``square of miracles,'' agreen lawn punctuated by a sculptural mix of buildings. Rossi says thereference makes a connection between his project and ``a sense of theinfinite within history and nature.'' While only the first phase of Rossi'sscheme is now complete--two contiguous buildings and a garden pavilion thattemporarily occupies the site of a proposed third office block--alreadythere's a there in a place that Rossi's American partner Morris Adjmi aptlycalls ``the middleof nowhere.''Rossi, author of the famed The Architecture of the City, has succeeded ininjecting an urbane presence into the sprawl of highways and strip-shoppingmalls that surround Celebration, a satellite of Orlando and that ultimatedestination, Walt Disney World. While Rossi's reputation as an ivory-toweracademic might seem at odds with profit- driven Disney, his architectureproves that theorist and practitioner can co-exist. Rossi's simple butpowerful forms are an artful combination of lucid and familiar shapes, areeasy to build, and, given the correct choice of materials, inexpensive.(Rossi's popularity among practitioners and students of architecture inthis country would suggest that his first project in the United Stateswould be an academic institution. The economy said otherwise: Rossi's 1986design of the School of Architecture at the University of Miami remainsunbuilt for lack of funding.)For many architects who seek to work at a scale equal to their ambitiousvision, Disney, with its deep pockets and the rare inclination to invest inarchitecture, has become an accepted, if not coveted client. Nonetheless,Rossi's first collaboration with the company, a competition entry for thefirst phase of the Euro Disney amusement park and resort in 1988, did notyield built results. Rossi's interest in American vernacular styles seemedto dovetail nicely with the company's man-date for themed entertainment.During design development of the Hotel New Orleans, however, Rossi balkedat a process that ranked the architect somewhere amidst consultants andefficiency experts. The parting was amicable. Three years later, an officebuilding, with its more obvious program requirements and straightforwardfloorplates, reunited client and architect in their traditional roles.Though Rossi was unaware of the specific plans for Celebration as hisproject began [see the article that follows for an overview ofCelebration], his complex, located just south of a highway, has proved tobe an effective billboard of sorts for the town that is sprouting up justbeyond the confines of his 30-acre site. The two buildings, with theirgiant-scale column grids and hefty cornice lines, convey a seriousness ofpurpose ideally suited to a $2.5-billion development that Disney hopes willserve as a model for future new towns. The buildings are also an apt symbolfor a principal tenant, the Disney Development Company, which, led by itspresident Peter Rummell and chief architect Wing Chao, has investedmillions on famous and not-so-famous architects and continues to commissionprojects at a prodigious rate, banking on architecture as a sellableattraction. For Rossi the commission has a more poetic connotation: ``I'vecome to understand the vastness of America.''CreditsCelebration PlaceCelebration, FloridaOwner: Disney Development CompanyArchitect: Aldo Rossi/Studio di Architettura--Aldo Rossi, Morris Adjmi,partners-in-charge; Wesley Wolfe, Erin Shilliday, project architects; DavidKang, Jan Greben, Joshua Davis, project teamAssociate Architect/Interior Designer: Smallwood, Reynolds, Stewart,Stewart & Associates--Michael Benning, principal-in-charge; WilliamShulman, Gerald Richrath, project architects; Wendy Mansfield, projectmanager/interiors; Jack Pruitt project designer/interiorsEngineers: Walter P.

SteinPlanning for the future. Aldo Rossi's masterplan for the Celebration Placeoffice complex (drawing below) calls for replacing the demountable gardenpavilion or ``folly'' (at left in photo opposite bottom) with a bar-likebuilding that completes the U-shaped ring of the first phase. Eventually,two structures will be added across the street--a total of five buildingson a grassy plain criss-crossed by pedestrian walkways and surrounded byparking lots. Rossi and the New York City outpost of his Milan-based Studiodi Architettura studied several planning and massing scenarios, including ascheme to locate the office blocks atop a shared parking base, an approachthat would have enhanced the monumentality of the complex.While Rossi favored the plinth in other projects he was developing at thetime--the Hotel Il Palazzo in Fukuoka, Japan [RECORD, May 1990, pages70-78], and the still unbuilt School of Architecture at the University ofMiami--the cost of subterranean construction was out of line with themodest Disney budget. (The two completed buildings came in at $65 persquare foot for the shells and lobbies. Associate architect Smallwood,Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart & Associates did the interiors.) Other proposalsdiscarded after closer scrutiny, reports Rossi's partner Morris Adjmi,include adding a road on axis into the courtyard. ``Too rigid,'' saysAdjmi.Illustration(s):Illustration: Plan: Aldo Rossi's masterplan for the Celebration Placeoffice complexPhotograph(s):Photograph: The demountable garden pavilion or ``folly''Photograph: The Celebration Place office complexCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. STANFORD'S NEW STYLECharles B. Thornton Center for Engineering ManagementStanford University Palo Alto, CaliforniaTanner Leddy Maytum Stacy, ArchitectsBy:Aaron BetskyStucco walls and red-tile roofs, arches and colonnades, courtyards filledwith live oak trees: that's the idiom of Stanford University. Ever since itwas founded by Leland Stanford in 1885, and laid out by Frederick LawOlmsted with buildings by Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge in an inspired mergerof monastery and Mission style, architects have been trying to figure outhow to adapt the imagery of one of the country's most prestigious academicinstitutions to changing uses, technologies, and perceptions. Now a newslate of buildings is modernizing the vocabulary with some unexpectedmaterials. Under the direction of Campus Architect David Neuman, whopreviously turned the University of California at Irvine into anarchitectural showpiece, Stanford has hired the likes of Robert A.M. Stern,Antoine Predock, Ricardo Legoretta, and Henry Cobb of Pei, Cobb, Freed &Partners to expand its architectural vision. The harbinger of this wave isa simple shed designed by Bill Leddy of the San Francisco firm, TannerLeddy Maytum Stacy.The Charles B. Thornton Center for Engineering Management is a12,000-square-foot addition to the 1977 Frederick Emmons Termon EngineeringBuilding. Designed by Harry Weese, this much beloved (by its inhabitants)essay in ``engineers' esthetic'' itself tried to update the vocabulary ofthe campus with clearly expressed concrete trays framing a skin thatappears to be almost wholly made up of wood shutters. To fit into thecampus, Weese sunk the large building two floors into the ground, creatinga light well of the garden in the rear. Leddy's challenge was to add roomfor Stanford's innovative design program, which is a joint venture betweenthe art, engineering, and business schools.The site defined the building. ``We soon realized that it was more aboutthe space between the two buildings than about the envelope,'' recallsLeddy. This fit Neuman's philosophy, since he believes that the landscapeis almost as important as the buildings themselves. ``It's what our alumniremember, it's what sets the character of the campus.'' Leddy placed thebuilding--two state-of-the-art ``case study'' classrooms outfitted ``almostlike broadcast studios'' and two loft-like design studios--in a rectangularvolume packed between an access road to the west and a grove of oak treesto the east. To the south, the Thornton Center presents a simple, lowfacade, ``setting the stage for the development of the campus across thestreet,'' as Neuman puts it. The building rises up on the north side bothto catch light for the studios and to answer the scale of the TermanBuilding. Working with landscape architect Peter Walker, Leddy thenreconfigured the sunken courtyard into an open, sloping outdoor room.The Thornton Center's main feature is its central gateway. This is anupdated version of the rhythm of great arches that march through thecampus, and that had already found a more rectilinear expression in theTerman Building. The portal is not just an expressive framing device: byusing it for external circulation, Leddy avoided the need for interiorcorridors. The steel trusses that frame the stairs provide lateral seismicbracing. ``This is what I think of as the strength of Tanner Leddy MaytumStacy's work,'' says Neuman. ``They give you an artistic expression ofstructural elements that allow for a simplicity of use, and that makes thebuilding easy to understand at every level.'' Carried out in an ``updatedversion of the Stanford vocabulary,'' as he puts it, the Thornton Center isa steel, stucco, concrete, and copper emblem of the architectural craft,and a clear representation of the reality of site, function, and theaspirations of the client.CreditsCharles B.

The Thornton Center is essentially a rectangular boxwhose interior spaces are defined by a row of steel trusses. The shape ofthese members creates a sloped roof that echoes the Stanford vocabulary,and is a form also typically used in industrial buildings to createdaylight monitors. Here the second-floor classrooms are opened up to thenorth light. Lateral seismic bracing is provided at the slightly off-centercenter portal, in the form of a Pratt truss. The end facades are frankexpressions of this structural and functional arrangement. The onlyadditions involve the site. These include screen walls, the portico--whosepoured-in-place columns echo the Terman Building--and the slightlywhimsical extension of the stair landing into a ``Pope's balcony.''Illustration(s):Illustration: The Thornton Center is essentially a rectangular box whoseinterior spaces are defined by a row of steel trussesCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. COMPLIANT SIGNAGEMade of zinc- or magnesium-based metals for interior applications, newSignEtch plaques can convey wayfinding directions in tactile and Braillelettering with good depth and definition.

Both plastic andnatural-wood products can offer excellent appearance and long-termperformance if properly selected and installed.According to the Vinyl Siding Institute, a division of the Society of thePlastics Industry, vinyl is now the most popular siding choice forresidential exteriors, including multifamily projects and condominiums. By1993, PVC had 44 percent of this market, compared to 39 percent for wood,14 percent for masonry, and 3 percent for ``other.'' Today's plastic withUV inhibitors represents more sophisticated chemistry than earlierpretty-much-just-white siding. Achieving UV stabilization has expanded thepalette to include deep tones and authentic historic colors; elements suchas door lintels and dentil moldings enable the designer to create adetailed facade using vinyl accessories.Correct installation is key   Rigid PVC siding must conform to the dimensional and othercharacteristics required by ASTM 3679; color change over the life of thesiding should be within this standard's color-hold guidelines.The main concern of a vinyl-siding installation should be to fasten thepanels as described in Rigid Vinyl Siding--Application Instructions: nailsmust be spaced correctly and centered in the slots; nailheads must notembed and restrict the thermal movement of the panel, anticipated to beabout 1/4-in. over a 12-ft length. Siding must be able to expand andcontract or it will buckle. Siding distortion from improper nailing is themost common complaint brought to the Institute, says Rich Gottwald,technical director.Over and above the dimensional and color-retention standards compelled byASTM D-3679, there is a wide number of surface grain pattern and glossoptions, panel profiles, and coordinating accessories for the architect tochoose from. We show five new product lines here.Half-round shingles   A new pattern in this maker's Cedar Impressions line, half-roundshingles are made in molds cast directly from hand-cut cedar pieces.

And itsphysical characteristics permit a range of versatile architecturalapplications not possible with other materials. For example, architect PaulGrant was able to apply bevel-edge cedar siding to garage doors, to tiethem into the house itself (top, right).To make sure that cedar achieves its full potential, an industry group(whose members are the major sources of red-cedar lumber in the U.S. andCanada) has published new guidelines for architects, trying to take some ofthe mystery out of using cedar as an exterior siding and to reflect currentthinking on appropriate wood grades, attachment methods, and finishingoptions (bottom, right).Specification. It's important to be able to evaluate different cedarsidings accurately, to select the most appropriate and economical grade forthe esthetic desired: will the siding have a clear, natural finish,weathering over time? Will it be painted or stained? The Association'sSpecification Guide includes good color photos that provide a realisticlook at the different grades of cedar and demonstrate their relativedifferences. Tables for each siding type--bevel, patterned tongue andgroove and lap siding, and vertically oriented board-and-batten--list theinfor-mation needed to insure that the wood specified matches the intendedend use. Criteria:-- Pattern. For example, plain bevel, rabbeted bevel, or wavy edge bevel.-- Nominal size. Thickness and Width.-- Quantities. Coverage tables translate different exposures into a surfacemeasure for calculating linear feet needed.-- Grade. For bevel siding, these would include Clear Vertical-GrainHeartwood, A Clear, Rustic, B Clear, Select Knotty, and Quality Knotty.-- Grading agency paragraph. The appropriate rule to reference eachsiding.-- Surface to be exposed. Designation of either smooth face or sawn shouldanticipate the finish to be applied: paint on smooth, clear or opaque stainon rough-sawn surfaces.-- Moisture content. Kiln-dried or green.Installation. The two most-common mistakes in putting up siding are notnailing to a suffi-cient base--fasteners must penetrate into a solid-woodstud--and using the wrong nail. Choose hot-dipped galvanized, aluminum, orstainless-steel nails only; stainless-steel is the best choice, especiallyif the siding is to be finished with transparent or semi-transparent stain.Make sure that the nail length accounts for sheathing thickness.Finishing. The Association strongly recom-mends back priming all siding,and feels that the performance and appearance expectations architects haveof cedar are better met with a coating appropriate to the look desired,whe-ther paint, semi- or opaque stain, or a clear or weathering finish.604/684-0266.

Jane LehmanMoney matters, it goes without saying. But the notable lack of it withinthe affordable housing realm drives nearly every step of the designprocess. For architects working on affordable housing projects, thechallenge, in a nutshell, is: How do you create tight but livable spacesfor little money on problem-laden sites for diverse groups of residents?The answer: Carefully, sensitively, and with respect for the particularneeds of the people who will be living there.The faithfulness of the architectural profession to these principles fallsto either extreme, says Bill Witte, a partner with The Related Companies ofCalifornia, an Irvine-based development company that specializes inlow-income housing. Much of the public housing built in America during thepost-war era failed to provide safe, attractive, or appropriately scaledplaces to live. While design was hardly the only cause of these problems,the architects involved in these projects and the profession as a wholeearned a reputation for being removed from the concerns of the people theywere designing for.Today, more architects recognize the need to listen to clients and endusers. ``Cost-efficiency is very important, particularly when there arelimits on rent,'' says Witte in explaining a key issue for theorganizations that build affordable housing. ``But so is sensitivity to theneeds of the people who will live there,'' he adds. ``Do architects get it?Some do, some don't.''Tax-credit tangle   Clients ready to start affordable projects often fight long and hard forfunds with which to proceed. Some patch together state and local funds, butmost rely on the federal low-income housing tax credit. With the demise ofthe federally funded low-income housing production programs some 15 yearsago, tax-credit financing (begun in 1986) is about the only thing that hassustained this market. The National Association of Home Builders estimatesthat in recent years the credit has enabled the annual construction of30,000 to 80,000 new low-income rental units and the rehabilitation ofabout 60,000 existing affordable apartments (graph below shows newconstruction using the credit).The program works this way: Each state, based on a per capita formula, getsa piece of an approximately $2.2-billion annual pie. Apartment developerssubmit proposals, including pre-schematics and site pro-formas, in aneffort to win a credit allocation from a state housing finance agency.Apartment rents must be affordable to households earning no more than 60percent of the area's median income. In this case, affordable means afamily spends no more than a third of its household budget to cover therent. In the Los Angeles area, that translates to around $6,000 to $9,000 ayear for shelter, reports Witte, whose company has 10 tax-credit projectsunderway in California.Developers who succeed in procuring credits from the state then sell them,often in conjunction with a syndicator, to investors who pay a lump sum forthe credits. The credits are used by investors for dollar-for-dollarwrite-offs against tax liabilities. With the investors' cash as an equitystake, developers do not need to borrow as much money to finance theprojects, thereby lowering the rents they need to charge.Credits' fate is in doubt--again   Although the system is working well, there is a fly in the ointment. Theprogram's permanent status is in doubt--again. Two years ago,Congress--then controlled by the Democrats--voted to end the uncertaintyassociated with year-by-year renewal of the credit by embedding itpermanently in the tax code. This fall, the Republican-led Congress agreedto revoke the tax credit's permanent status as of December 31, 1997. Ifthat happens, the program's supporters say, the tax credit will not farewell at a time when federal spending is shrinking. ``Sunsetting the taxcredit is tantamount to killing it,'' states John McEvoy, executivedirector of the National Council of State Housing Agencies. The program'sbest hope is a Presidential veto with instructions to Congress to returnwith a new budget reconciliation bill that, among other things, preservesthe credit's permanent status, explains Andre Shashaty, the publisher of aSan Francisco-based magazine devoted to affordable housing finance. That,he says, would insulate it from the knock-down, drag-out federal budgetfights expected in the coming years.In terms of design, taking a one-size-fits-all approach to affordablehousing is destined to fail, given the diversity of the intended occupants.Residents may be single mothers, two parents with lots of kids,inter-generational households, senior citizens, the disabled, or newimmigrants. This may mean including in the program special supportfeatures, such as open space, playgrounds, athletic fields, child-careoperations, job-training facilities, stores, or social-services offices. Orit may mean recognizing that the needs of any one group may be foreign tothe architect's own experience, says Michael Pyatok, head of Oakland-basedPyatok Associates, which designs about 400 units of low-income housing ayear on the West Coast.Involving users in the design process   ``With over 20 applicants for every affordable apartment, architects candesign just about anything and because the rent is cheap and the buildingis new, it will be rented,'' states Pyatok. ``Consequently, architects havefelt free to design for their peers and their ideology, but invariably wehave torn those things down.'' Pyatok addresses the problem by including inthe design process the neighborhood from which the tenants are likely tocome. Recently, the architects met every two weeks with community membersliving near the site proposed for a project in San Jose. At the sessions,five groups of 10 Latinos worked with modeling kits to explore apartmentand site possibilities. After showing seven historical design directions,as well as their contemporary interpretations, Pyatok was surprised whenall of the groups, working independently, not only settled on the samecategory but picked the same two images out of the four offered. Thewinner? ``They loved the vibrancy of the Crafts style.''A different tack was taken by Solomon Architecture & Urban Design inshaping the Vest Pocket Community in Fairfax, California, a project with 19units of rental housing shared by roommates and designed to look likesingle-family houses. The non-profit developer, Innovative Housing of SanRafael, matches up roommates, deliberately bringing together the disabled,seniors, and single mothers. Besides the usual challenges of affordablehousing design, privacy was an especially important issue here becausenon-related people would be living together, says architect DanielSolomon.By definition, low-income housing is smaller and denser than market-ratedevelopments. The trick is to accomplish the economic trade-offs whileavoiding the ``danger of making these places unworkable,'' explains AviFriedman, director of the Affordable Housing Program at the school ofarchitecture at McGill University in Montreal. The program doesn't justexamine issues of affordable housing, it actually develops new prototypesas well. The 14-foot-wide and 36-foot-deep GrowHomes it pioneered cost$60,000.Part of the secret to designing affordable housing is creating efficientfloor plans. ``I have just gotten good at putting units together so thereis no wasted space,'' says Solomon. Other critical ingredients are goodaccess to daylight and views, says Joan Goody of Goody Clancy & Associatesin Boston, a 50-person firm that has designed such award-winning housingprojects as the 1988 Tent City and Langham Court [RECORD, July 1992, pages92-97]. Goody is adept at carving four bedrooms out of the same spacedevoted to two in market-rate projects.Nonetheless, architects should no more skimp on design details of housingfor poor people than they should when designing for more affluent people.``Affordable housing does not cost any less to build,'' asserts Goody,``and it is a myth to think that it can.'' Many of Goody's projects,including Langham Court, mix low-, moderate-, and upper-income residentstogether without making quality distinctions among the units. ``It is notnormal for people to live segregated by income.'' A well-built project thatfits into its surrounding neighborhood can help counter the knee-jerkresponse by many groups to resist the placement of affordable housing intheir communities. Such a project ``becomes a billboard for the nextproject you may want to do,'' says Pyatok. ``It dispels doubts that othercommunities might have.''Responding to site and context   Low-income housing suffers from a poor reputation generally, drivenlargely by deeply flawed site designs from the past, which set the stagefor crime and vandalism, says Solomon. The wholesale leveling of existingneighborhoods in the 1950s and 1960s in the name of urban renewal``destroyed the town fabric and stigmatized the poor,'' says Solomon.Lost in the razing, explains Pyatok, was the old urban morphology of theAmerican town that included rowhouses with front porches and backyards, thecelebration of corner homes, the street grid, residential alleys,courtyards, and storefronts. Bringing that all back, he says, will let``people get to know each other again.''Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: Tax Credit Starts   The federal low-income housing tax credit has played an important rolein financing affordable housing over the last decade (chart right).

PearsonLocated on the former site of Sears Roebuck & Co.'s world headquarters inwest Chicago, Homan Square is an ambitious development that aims to revivea decaying neighborhood. Until the early 1970s when Sears moved to itsworld's-tallest tower in downtown Chicago, the 55-acre site was the heartof its global operations and included a 4-million-sq-ft warehouse, officebuildings, and giant parking lots. Sears' move downtown, combined withracial unrest in 1968, triggered a downward spiral of decay anddisinvestment that left the North Lawndale area an urban basket case. NowHoman Square is reversing that trend, bringing new subsidized andmarket-rate housing, and some commercial development, back to theneighborhood. A joint-venture of Sears and The Shaw Company, a respectedlocal developer, Homan Square will eventually encompass 600 new units ofrental and for-sale housing, as well as the redevelopment of existingoffice space for private businesses and the possible conversion of a 1905brick tower into a community center. Thanks to Sears' donation of the landand its $13,000 subsidy for each for-sale unit in the first two phases, theproject is providing housing for low-income families. Additional subsidiesof $20,000 per unit from the city's New Homes for Chicago program andhousing tax credits are keeping most of the units here within the reach offamilies earning less than 80 percent of the local median income. Asmasterplanned by Nagle Hartray Danker Kagan McKay Architect/Planners, HomanSquare is a series of mixed-income blocks that fit into the city's existingstreet grid while varying enough from the usual formula to establish itsown identity. ``The idea was to develop a site plan that would work withthe scale of the existing neighborhood, while creating defensible openspaces in each block,'' says partner-in-charge Dirk Danker. Instead oflining up all the housing along the street, as is typical in Chicago, thearchitects carved out small green spaces at the four corners and two largeropen spaces in the middle of each block. To make sure these open spaces aresafe places for residents, the masterplan organizes housing units so theyface the outdoor spaces. By lining the open areas with front doors, theplan makes sure the residents take possession of the communal spaces.Although most homes are serviced from the back by alleys, the amount ofspace devoted to these internal roads is kept to a minimum and backyardsare fenced off so that each family controls this space. Homan Squareincludes three types of housing--detached single-family homes, townhouses,and apartments--and each block includes all three. By integrating all threein each block, the developers made sure there would be a mix of incomegroups and family types in each phase of the project. ``We wanted to mix itup as much as possible,'' says Danker. Three-story apartment buildings withsix units each anchor the four corners of the block, while 24 single-familyhomes wrap around the two lawns in the middle of the block. In between arefour rows of townhouses, five units to a row. The result is 68 units to theblock. The three-bedroom single-family houses range in size from 1,590 to1,670 square feet and in price from $92,000 to $97,000. In the project'sfirst phase (one block), which was completed and fully occupied in thesecond half of 1995, rents ranged from $385 a month for 850-sq-ftapartments to $490 for 1,160-sq-ft townhouses. Some of the units havehalf-sunken basements and all are simple wood-frame structures with woodtrusses and clad with brick at the base and stucco and EIFS above. By usingmasonry only at the base, stacking plumbing, and using efficient floorplans that almost eliminate corridors, the architects were able to keepconstruction costs down to about $70 a square foot. Corner windows and openliving spaces make these units feel larger than they are. A second block isunder construction and will be ready this spring. Phase 2 is already soldout. A third phase with 16 market-rate homes is being designed by SchroederMurchie Laya Associates. ``Our hope is to establish a neighborhood that'sgood, a place where people want to live,'' says design principal JamesNagle. The plan seems to be working. In fact, the project is encouragingresidents of adjacent blocks to upgrade their homes.CreditsHoman SquareChicagoOwner: The Shaw CompanyArchitect: Nagle Hartray Danker Kagan McKay Architects/Planners--James L.Nagle, design principal; Dirk W.

Because the program calledfor buildings with 44 efficiency apartments, four married-couplesapartments, and such ``enriched'' services as counseling,medication-management, and shared dining, Kirschenfeld argued it would bedifficult to fit all that into an existing building shell. With each240-sq-ft apartment having its own full bathroom and kitchenette, theplumbing requirements alone would have made converting an old structure anightmare, says the architect. Flexibility was also a priority, since thebuildings would house special populations ranging from the mentally ill todrug abusers. Three years later, the state agency was eliminated by a newRepublican governor, but a prototype SRO, designed by Kirschenfeld's firmArchi-trope and run by a non-profit organization called Services for theUnderserviced, opened in Brooklyn. The five-story, 24,200-sq-ft buildingwas finished on time for $2.83 million ($117 a square foot). Using a simplebearing-block-and-concrete-plank structure and an efficient double-loadedcorridor plan for the apartment floors, the architect was able to lavishattention on a few important features--such as a finely detailed brickfacade with 8-inch reveals around all openings. The result is a buildingthat projects a sense of depth and solidity. Inside, the first floor isdevoted to public spaces that benefit greatly from 11-foot ceilings, woodwainscoting, and furniture designed by the architect. By providing anattractive lounge and dining room overlooking a rear yard, the buildingencourages residents to practice their social skills, while allowing themto retreat to their own rooms. In the apartments, 8-foot-6-inch ceilingsgive some lift to the small units.CreditsClient: N.Y.S.

In fact, according to RodneyFriedman, the partner-in-charge of design, the eight apartment buildingshere are better built and have better finishes than most market-rateprojects. How is this possible? By eliminating a private developer'soverhead and profit margin, by getting the city of San Jose to supply someof the up-front equity to reduce the construction mortgage, and by usinglow-income housing tax credits, First San Jose Housing was able to applymore money to the buildings themselves. ``It was great working with FirstSan Jose,'' says Friedman. ``Their only goal was to build the best project,not to make money.'' Designed to create a sense of community, the projectincludes a 3,000-square-foot clubhouse with swimming pool, a playground fortots, and communal green areas. In addition, some of the apartmentbuildings have front stoops for socializing and all look onto a centralallee landscaped with palm trees. All of the residential buildings arefour-story wood-frame structures. Five are built on concrete slabs, whilethree are built over a single level of half-sunken parking. Occupying a7.7-acre site in a suburban part of a redevelopment district, the projectincludes 246 apartments: 12 one-bedroom units of 600 square feet, 150two-bedroom units of about 850 square feet, and 84 three-bedroom unitsranging from 1,104 to 1,400 square feet. In addition to the communaloutdoor areas, the project provides a private outdoor space for everyapartment--either a patio or a terrace. Top-floor apartments haveextra-height living rooms, some with 14-foot ceilings. To break down thescale of each building and give it the look of a series of smaller attachedstructures, the architects used a variety of exterior materials (horizontalwood siding, cedar shingles, painted wood railings) and colors.Architect: Fisher-Friedman Associates--Rodney F.

LewisLast July, on a hot, humid day in Washington, D.C., the Korean War VeteransMemorial was dedicated. Over six years had elapsed since the spring 1989national design competition was won by a team of architects and landscapearchitects based at Pennsylvania State University.That team proposed building a metaphoric landscape of expansive triangularplazas, groves of plane trees with canopies pruned into distorted shapes,and a flag. Perhaps most important to the memorial imagery of this stronglygeometrical landscape, occupying the southwest corner of the Mall oppositethe Vietnam Veterans Memorial, would be a column of 38 American soldiersfrozen in a moment of convergence on their single destination, the flag. Itwas a memorial design intended to be at once representational and symbolic,a commentary on both the costly horror of war and the honor of combatantswho, when called, serve their nation dutifully and unselfishly to wagewar.After receiving their prize money, the winning designers--Burns Lucas, Len,Lucas, Pennypacker Oberholtzer (referred to as BL3PO, then BL3 whenPennypacker Oberholtzer dropped out)--were paired up as ``designconsultants'' with Cooper-Lecky Architects, the Washington firm designatedas architect-of-record. Cooper-Lecky, having worked previously with MayaLin in executing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, had the technical expertiseand procedural experience needed to carry out the project.But conflicts soon arose between the two design groups as substantialchanges were suggested by the Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board,numerous federal agencies with jurisdiction over the site, andCooper-Lecky. The changes sought to reduce the size and cost of thememorial, simplify its overall composition, and improve circulation aroundand through it. BL3 resisted many of the proposed modifications, claimingthat the integrity of their original design was being violated, that theirconcept was being unreasonably compromised and watered down. Further, theyfelt themselves being increasingly excluded from the design process.The impasse led to BL3's complete withdrawal and subsequently to litigationin federal court, which proved ultimately unsuccessful since the terms ofthe competition guaranteed neither the faithful implementation of thewinning design nor the winners' participation in the post-competitiondesign process. Having become the sole architect, Cooper-Lecky then spentthree years working through multiple design variations. After many meetingsand trips back to the drawing board, they finally obtained approval of whathas now been built and dedicated.Remnants of the competition-winning design can be found in the finalensemble created by Cooper-Lecky, sculptor Frank C. Gaylord II, andmuralist Louis Nelson: the soldiers, reduced in number from 38 to 19, arestill marching toward a common objective, the flag; the ``field ofservice'' occupied by the soldiers is triangular, reminiscent of thecompetition-winning scheme's geometry; a grove of trees--lindens, not planetrees--is an integral part of the ensemble, although its formal dispositionis different. Not derived from the competition-winning design is a164-foot-long wall of polished black granite--can anyone doubt its sourceof inspiration?--etched with the faces of support troops and terminating inan elevated circular pool at the eastern vertex of the triangular field.Metal soldiers in a Platonic landscape   As shaped by Cooper-Lecky, the premiated design evolved into a memorialsmaller in size and more accessible to visitors both physically andsymbolically. Like the original BL3 design, the immaculately detailedmemorial's most arresting architectural quality results from compositionaltension: the larger-than-life, gun-metal-gray soldiers in motion, moldedsoftly and imprecisely of stainless steel, looking anxious, weary,determined; and a highly abstracted, almost Platonic landscape crafted ofhard-edged, machined slabs of granite--long rectangular wall, linearplinths, a circular pool, furrows in the triangular field defined byparallel strips of polished stone separating rows of juniper.The Korean War Veterans Memorial has been enthusiastically welcomed andgenerally praised by the public, both for its design and its craftsmanship.But this writer cannot look at it without thinking that something wentawry, that both the design process and final product were flawed.Cleansing a project's design history   As I walked around the memorial, its debt to its precursor wasunmistakable. I kept recalling the BL3 scheme, as if I were looking not atan original work of design, but rather at a radically remodeled version ofa work by someone else, a work beaten into acceptable shape by itsarchitect and by the several official bodies with absolute dominion overthis landscape--the Korean War Memorial Advisory Board, the American BattleMonuments Commission, the National Capital Memorial Commission, theNational Park Service, and the Commission of Fine Arts.And how thoroughly the memorial's design history had been cleansed, therebeing little official mention of the design competition, the conceptualstarting point for the design, and little credit given to BL3 for itscontribution of the germinal ideas.Few who see the memorial will care that its creation was plagued by yearsof controversy and compromise. Visitors will like its relatively smallscale and its unambiguous figurative and representational messages. Theywill not pose questions: Why so many soldiers? (Nineteen is half of 38, adubiously meaningful reference to the parallel dividing North and SouthKorea.) Why the number of disparate elements? Why the wall lamely echoingthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial? Why, next to the flag toward which thesoldiers are struggling, a round pool into which the end of the etched wallplunges? Why isn't the flag plaza less encumbered, surrounded instead byopen space no less capable of evoking contemplation than a pool of water?To put the Korean War Veterans Memorial in perspective, let's consider thepainful evolution of another project--the FDR Memorial. Four decades afterCongress set up the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission,construction finally began in 1994 in West Potomac Park, near the TidalBasin.A detailed chronology of this design saga requires several pages, buthighlights include: a 1960 design competition won by Pedersen & Tilney;years of design revisions with several cycles of approval and rejectionbetween 1961 and 1965; selection of Marcel Breuer to develop a new design,accepted by the FDR Memorial Commission but rejected in 1967 by theCommission of Fine Arts; dormancy during the Vietnam War; selection in 1974of landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to design the memorial as part of a27-acre park, with the design--including sculptures--developed and approvedbetween 1975 and 1978; design modified to significantly reduce costs,approved in 1979; in 1981, resolutions introduced in Congress authorizingconstruction of the memorial; further design by Halprin to obtain detailedcost estimates in 1984, after which the project again lay dormant until1988, when Rep. Claude Pepper, the new Memorial Commission chairman,reactivated the project; still more design changes approved in 1990; atlast, a 1991 groundbreaking ceremony, followed by a $10-million capitalcampaign to augment the $42 million in funds provided by Congress, withconstruction finally starting in 1994.A monument to overdesign   The ultimate FDR Memorial irony is that Roosevelt himself asked that nosuch memorial be built, a reflection of his discomfort with idolization andhis concerns that grandiose memorials can exaggerate, obscure, oroversimplify history. Unfortunately, his wishes were ignored, and hisreasoning may be vindicated. The FDR Memorial, costing over $50 million, isa monument to overdesign, a landscape predicated on the notion that biggermust be better.The memorial expropriates far too much public land--nearly eight acres ofWest Potomac Park. Entailing an 800-ft-long procession through four outdoorgarden rooms, it is replete with landscaping and meandering rectilinearwalls, numerous water features, sculptures by a half dozen artists, andextensive narrative inscriptions and quotations. It's not that a gardencouldn't be an appropriate memorial, nor that pieces of Halprin's designaren't attractive. But the size of this sprawling, historically didacticensemble is excessive, notwithstanding the significance of FDR's presidencyencompassing the Depression and World War II.Commemorating this president and those dozen years could be accomplishedmore forcefully and succinctly, in keeping with FDR's wishes, were thememorial's physical form and energy more concentrated in the Malllandscape.Further, looking into the future with a perspective that spans centuriesinstead of decades of history, and considering the finiteness of the Mall,it seems questionable to dedicate so much of that precious landscape to oneindividual and only 12 years of 20th-century history. How and where will wecommemorate the important individuals and events of the 21st, 24th, or 30thcentury?More memorials are already in the pipeline, among them the Women inMilitary Service to America Memorial, for which ground has been broken, anAir Force memorial, a World War II memorial, and a memorial to Dr. MartinLuther King, Jr. Countless others have been proposed, abandoned, or builtelsewhere. Can anyone doubt that countless more will be proposed in thefuture?Bureaucracy and democracy in action   Why has creating a memorial in Washington become so arduous andcontentious? And how can designers preserve the integrity of their originaldesigns, given so complex a process?Building memorials in Washington is, in fact, symptomatic of what happenstoday in state, county, and municipal jurisdictions throughout the UnitedStates. As architects know all too well, constructing anything in thepublic domain, be it a memorial or a library or a bus depot, involves more``cooks in the kitchen'' than ever before--more governmental and citizenreview agencies, more public hearings, more permits, and more contradictoryopinions about design. Consequently, the implementation process has becomemore time-consuming, more expensive, and more likely to yield unfortunatedesign compromises. This is bureaucracy and democracy in action, the resultof a process involving a diverse citizenry armed with diverse points ofview. How much easier was the architect's monument-building task inprevious centuries when only a single patron had to be courted andsatisfied.Further worsening matters, political correctness can enter the designprocess, often conflicting directly with esthetic aspirations. Memorialcommissioners and other review officials are especially sensitive aboutmemorial constituents--such as veterans and their families--and how thepublic in general might interpret a memorial's design.Both explicit and implicit symbolism in commemorative structures embue themwith great meaning. Yet since people readily ``deconstruct'' and findunintended symbolism in works of art, a design with potentiallycontroversial overtones inevitably is challenged. Maya Lin's VietnamVeterans Memorial--its black-granite walls descending below grade and, tosome, suggesting condemnation rather than commemoration--epitomizes astructure inviting negative interpretations. Amazingly, Lin's designchanged little from design-competition concept to realization--a tribute toher remarkable tenacity.Design competitions are a favorite and seemingly appropriate strategy fordesigning memorials, but they pose problems. Improperly managed, or withouta well-written program and insightful jury, they rarely succeed. And timingis always problematic. Memorial sponsors want a design concept early on tocatalyze fund raising. But because construction cannot begin without fundsand design approvals in place, years can elapse between the conclusion of adesign competition and the beginning of construction. As the FDR Memorialillustrates, much can happen during this interval to affect the design:costs rise, esthetic values shift, public perceptions change. A trendy,winning design may have a short shelf life. What was embraced one yearmight be rejected a few years later.Jockeying for position on the Mall   One final question is worth asking. Why has memorial fever seemed tointensify during the closing decades of the 20th century? [See RECORD,October 1995, page 9.] This is a question that clearly preoccupied membersof Congress in 1986 when they adopted stricter memorial building criteria.There seems to be rising group consciousness among Americans about theirgroup's special history, their unique experiences and struggles both in warand peace. Moreover, the number of distinct ``groups'' lobbying formemorial sites is likewise rising. Perhaps it's the approach of a newmillenium. Yet this is not really a new phenomenon--memorial buildingfrenzies have followed all major wars, going back to the AmericanRevolution.America's capital with its extraordinary public landscape will always bethe preferred setting for national memorials. But because the Mall islimited in size and, in its present form, less than 100 years old, one canvisualize it becoming cluttered with memorials during the next century.What then would remain for the centuries to follow?Americans must identify and embrace sites in other locales forcommemorative structures. Otherwise, an excess of memorials built on oraround the Mall will detract from and devalue those that are most sacred,the few that truly deserve to occupy the pantheon.Illustration(s):Illustration: Map: Memorials on the Mall, Washington, D.C.Photograph(s):Photograph: Two Photographs: The Korean War Veterans MemorialPhotograph: Four Photographs: The competition-winning design for the KoreanWar Veterans Memorial by BL3 (1), the Women in Military Service for AmericaMemorial by Weiss/Manfredi (2) and Lawrence Halprin's FDR Memorial (3, 4).About the Author(s):Roger K.

RossAs we've been saying for some time, the full promise of computers inarchitectural practice can only be fulfilled if a wide range ofmanufacturer and price information is computerized in a standard format.Once that happens, data can be more easily exchanged among various sectorsof the construction industry.The two biggest questions about that computerization--who will handle thejob of computerization, and how will it be standardized--were answered inpart over the past two months.Autodesk, the people who bring you Auto-CAD, have been near the center ofall of developing the standards. With the help of several major informationproviders--including the Sweet's Group at the McGraw-HillCompanies--Autodesk will be publishing a ``Design and ConstructionLibrary'' of ``intelligent'' digital data.Sweet's has been putting vendor material on CD-ROM for some time. In fact,it announced a service to prepare such material for vendors this past June.Autodesk's Data Publishing group started its Mechanical Library last March.That effort was, in many ways, the first example of intelligent digitalcontent for design professionals.But the architectural world poses far more problems than mechanicalengineering--more products by smaller vendors, combined in more ways andunder more varied conditions. Thus, Autodesk is cooperating with a range ofdata publishers that have construction-industry experience.Sweet's is producing a CD-ROM series for Autodesk's Data Publishing Groupthat will contain data on building products and equipment, inpre-formatted, dimensioned CAD files. Sweet's research shows that about athird of all drafting time is spent re-drawing building components andproducts that have already been selected and specified.Sweet's has long required that manufacturers put their materials into astandard print format for inclusion in its catalogs. But doing the same forcomputer formats requires even more cooperation from vendors. The vendorscertainly can distribute independently of Sweet's, and many do. But if theydon't comply with the Sweet's standards for their details, they may be shutout of many designers' decisions.R.S. Means, a subsidiary of Southam Construction Information Network, willproduce CD-ROMs that link to AutoCAD, providing what could become thestandard way to link objects (doors, windows, wall materials, and so forth)in a drawing with cost data. Again, the potential for increased accuracyand decreased time spent is high. James D'Arezzo, vice president ofAutodesk's Data Management Group, estimates, ``AEC professionals spend asmuch as 25 percent of each day documenting design decisions and changeorders.'' Being able to update costs--if not all costs--instantaneously aschanges are contemplated modifies the way design professionals approach thewhole process.Another Southam affiliate, MSA (Manufacturers' Survey Associates, Inc.) isalso joining up to produce hvac, plumbing, and electrical-design data forCD-ROM. So is a more traditional publisher, John Wiley & Sons.Thus, makers of building products and traditional data publishers, ratherthan software companies, will put all of this in computer form. But thetraditional publishers and the product vendors must cooperate with softwarecompanies. Otherwise, everything won't work together.But will it all work together anyway? And what information should sellersof building products include in their computer files? That has also beenanswered, in large part by the industry push to standardize computer``objects.''The Industry Alliance for Interoperability is trying to standardize whatinformation, exactly, a standard object will contain at a minimum--theso-called ``industry foundation classes'' for such objects as doors andwindows. Such information could include materials, colors, weight, and fireratings as well as dimensions [RECORD, August 1995, pages 32-34].Autodesk's largest competitor, MicroStation's Bentley, joined the alliancelast October. IAI was originally championed by Autodesk, but is now anindependent organization.With Bentley joining the alliance, it will ultimately mean that ``objects''could work with both major families of CAD software--AutoCAD andMicroStation. We say ``could'' because many vendors of add-on software haveyet to sign on. Many have, and Bentley's action, along with various datapublishers' willingness to bring product manufacturers along, shouldaccelerate the trend. It should also bring many other CAD vendors into thefold.All this won't happen overnight, of course. In fact, release of the firstbatch of ``foundation classes'' was supposed to take place last fall. It isimminent as we go to press. And, although publishers' automated``intelligent'' catalogs are released this year, it will be some timebefore they will be fully compliant with object classes (there won't evenbe standards for many products this year) and before CAD software willfully interact with the objects.But the road ahead now looks rather clear--and wide.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightARCHITECTURAL RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 184, No. CHEAP TOOLSHere are three graphics packages that won't break the bank, but may makeyour office more efficient--and your life easier as well.Visio Technical 4.0Vendor: Visio Corporation, 520 Pike St., Suite 1800, Seattle, WA 98101,206/521-4500, fax 206/521-4501, CompuServe GO VISIO, Microsoft NetworkVisio Forum, http://www.visio.com.Equipment required: Computer capable of running Windows 3.1, Windows NT3.51 or higher, or Windows 95. Full installation takes 30 MB of diskspace.Cost:$249 (street price closer to $150).Imagine ``drawing'' by dragging pre-defined shapes onto the page andconnecting them. That's what Visio is all about. When it first appeared in1992, Visio was aimed more at simple but annoying jobs such as drawingorganization charts. With Technical Version 4.0, it becomes a full-featuredtool, particularly useful for facilities management, landscaping, HVAC, andother tasks that require repetitive drafting work.Each shape (Visio 4.0 comes with about 2,000 of them) has data behindit--data that governs its behavior. You can create an unlimited number ofnew shapes as well, either from scratch, by modifying old shapes, or byimporting drawings or symbols into Visio. AutoCAD symbol libraries canbecome libraries of Visio shapes.The data is in what Visio calls a Shape Sheet--there's one for each shape.It can contain formulas to govern the behavior of shapes as you scale them.Thus, you can set up a desk to stretch without getting wider, or a table toget larger without enlarging the associated chairs.As you might expect, there's full import and export of AutoCAD DXF and DWG(binary) files, as well as IGES and Illustrator. There's import ofCorelDraw, Micrografx DRW, and many standard formats such as TIF and PCX.But Visio throws in some tricks as well. You can, for instance, assign thesame object to more than one layer in Visio. You can also use a Visiodrawing on top of an AutoCAD drawing--for redlining or perhaps to addfurniture to an office plan.By the way, Visio used to call itself Shapeware--same company, new name.Manuals: On-line for using Visio itself. Printed 420-page manual fordeveloping your own solutions--by creating new shapes and so forth.Ease of use: Trivial to draw with; creating something as sophisticated as afacilities--management layout requires lots of work. Wide choice ofinterfaces--you can make it look like Microsoft Office, NovellPerfectOffice, or Lotus SmartSuite.Error-trapping: Excellent.XCAD 3.0Vendor: Xitron Software Corporation, 1500 Chiquita Center, 250 East FifthSt., Cincinnati, OH 45202. 513/762-7638, fax 513/662-3440, 800/817-8172.Equipment required: Computer capable of running Windows NT or Windows3.1/3.11. A fully tested 32-bit Windows 95 version should be available bythe time this review appears. Pentium processor strongly recommended.Price:$495; street price about $420.Looking for an easy-to-use 3D CAD program with good AutoCAD compatibility?XCAD may be for you. Its major weakness as a 3D sketch tool is that itlacks boolean capability--you can't use one shape to add to or hollow outanother. There's no binary (DWG) import or export in the version wereviewed, but DWG, DXG, and IGES exchange is in the 32-bit version. Many ofour users found it a delight to draw with anyway, on fast computers.You get continuous shading with multiple light sources (LightWorks wasadded this fall), up to eight viewports (windows) on screen at once, and acommand emulator that makes it similar to AutoCAD, MicroStation, or GenericCADD.XCAD is also being marketed as the drawing engine in others' specializeddisk packages. It supports referenced drawings and has goodsurface-modeling tools (most of the NURBS set). There's a macro-languageand a development kit available that can be used to add functionality toXCAD.Manuals: Separate paperbacks for getting started, tutorial, and a detaileduser guide/command reference.Ease of use: Excellent 3D interface; slow on an older non-Pentium machine.Error-trapping: Unlimited undo function. You can password-protect a drawingon top of any network administrative scheme; if you lose the password,there's no ''back door'' to get back your work.Planix 3D Exterior Designer 1.0Equipment required: Any computer that can run any version of Windows 3.1 orhigher. Must have separate math coprocessor if CPU is 386 or 486SX. Displaycapable of at least 256 colors strongly recommended.Vendor: Softdesk Retail Products, 10725 Ambassador Drive, Kansas City, MO64153.Price: Street price roughly $50.Here's a great (and cheap) tool for ``brick and stick'' designers to layout a home, landscape it, and play around with its exterior finish.Actually, it's meant for amateurs--non-architects--but you don't have totell anyone.The interface is ingenious. For instance, you lay out your building in planby adjusting an existing footprint (there are many to choose from) bypulling on its ``handles.'' Each story, and the roof, can have a differentfootprint to allow overhangs and setbacks.As you work on each item--plan, elevation, landscaping, roof--placing trimand windows or doors and so forth, Planix automatically groups things intolayers for you. The package comes with plenty of symbols--trees andwindows, for instance--and allows you to create or add more. When you wantto visualize the results, click on ``render'' to get an image.The underlying software engine is Drafix, one of the first and bestWindows-based CAD packages. (Softdesk's retail division was Foresight,Drafix's developer.) But you can't directly save into an AutoCAD- orMicroStation-compatible file format. Files can be saved as bitmaps, or forPlanix Home 3D (it does the interiors). That's the only real drawback.Manuals: Straightforward 55-page reference and tutorial.Ease of use: Trivial. Fun. You won't break the training budget on thisone.Error-trapping: You can place the wrong thing in the wrong place, butfixing it is a snap. You can also place a misleading filename extension ona filename.Illustration(s):Illustration: Two Screens: Visio Technical 4.0: Note the kidney-shapedswimming pool and the underlying ``shapesheet.'' Changing the sheet changesthe image and vice-versa. On-line help is context-sensitive and wellwritten. You can vary the placement of the windows on the screen as well.The icons in this case are in the same style as Microsoft Office.Illustration: Screen: XCAD 3.0: There's a full range of 3D as well as 2Ddrawing, dimensioning, and shading tools.

RussellIt's an election year. While these four words rightly evoke groans fromthose not addicted to the endless campaigning and information-freediscourse endemic to political life today, there's no better time toconsider the role architects can, do, and should play in the politicalprocess. Further, this political season begins just one year after a cadreof candidates was chosen in states and Congress pledged to move politicalpower to the states.Most of the attention-getting debate this year has been at the nationallevel, as the budget, regulations, and such massive programs as Medicareand welfare have come under intense scrutiny. And the big Capitol Hillbattles have pushed aside for now issues that most affect building design(tort reform, qualifications-based selection). Bricks-and-mortar buildingprograms have been substantially cut, however [RECORD, November 1995, page33]. Even if, as many in the new Congress advocate, programs are eliminatedand others largely shift to states, government still significantlydetermines the circumstances under which buildings are designed and built.Can design professionals better use the political process to realize theirgoals? Perhaps more fundamentally, is the shift from national to local andthe move to greater privatization good for architects?``Architects' interests don't really fall along party lines,'' observesNancy Somerville, vice president, state and local government affairs at theAIA. ``What does follow party lines is the anti-regulatory environment andthe pro-business environment. These agendas mean there's a greaterlikelihood of tort reform but, on the other hand, a resistance to uniformbuilding codes and more efforts to consolidate or defund agencies likestate licensing boards.'' Although much of the political drama is inWashington, D.C., ``Most legislation where rubber hits the road in terms ofarchitects' income,'' Somerville says, ``takes place at the state level.''What government is doing to design   Somerville and Daniel Gross, AIA program director, state and localgovernment affairs, outline these key challenges:Procurement: As many as 14 states will face challenges toqualifications-based consultant selection criteria. Also, although AIApolicy accepts design/build for appropriate projects, AIA is challengingdesign/build procurement when it is cost-driven, not qualifications-driven,and when a high level of uncompensated work is required for selection. Somestates, ``unhappy with the level of litigation on projects,'' but also``not managing the process well,'' says Somerville, see alternate-deliverymethods as a panacea.Professional licensing: The deregulatory mood, says Somerville, has spurreda ``large-scale attack on the regulation of professions.'' She says criticsclaim ``that most state licensing exists for protection of the regulatedand not the good of society.'' Though she feels that architects will haveto fight battles on this front (10 states face ``sunset'' of licensing lawsin 1996), she doesn't see the licensing of architects as threatened.Indeed, 12 states may add a licensing category--through certification ortitle laws for interior designers.The definition of architectural practice (where, typically, engineers seekauthority to design a wider range of building types) and the overlap ofengineering with architecture ``top the list of licensing-law concerns'' inthe states, says Somerville [RECORD, July 1995, page 27].Liability and tort reform: Professionals are seeking ``certificate ofmerit'' legislation in many states, which would require early independentexamination of whether suits against architects (among others) have merit.Some states have exposed architects and engineers to liability forthird-party suits. This permits injured workers--prevented from suingcontractors by workers' compensation statutes--to seek recompense from thedesign team. Other states have relieved architects from such liability.Tort reforms sought by A/Es include caps on punitive damages and onjoint-and-several liability. The latter can make the ``deep pockets''architect (or the firm's insurer) liable for damages far in excess ofproven culpability.Selling architecture on Capitol Hill   In Washington, the budget-cutting vogue brings bad news for architects,especially for firms that have been doing big GSA courthouse andoffice-building projects. It's not only GSA budgets that have been cut,though. Assisted-housing programs at HUD, embassies, R&D (which supportsmuch campus research-lab construction), transit and passenger rail, andVeterans Administration hospitals have all been slashed. Of thosecategories where spending is rising, only slightly higher funds forairports and dollars for military-housing improvements are likely todirectly benefit architects.Should architects storm Congress' ramparts? It's not AIA's style. ``We playwith the deck we're dealt,'' says Al Eisenberg, director, federallegislative affairs at AIA. Don't mount a monumental (and probably losing)battle to restore cuts in building programs, he says. ``Congress believesthat the tax code is the way to get things done rather than categoricgrants or block grants. If the arena to play in is the tax code, we'll playin that arena.'' Thus AIA is vigorously defending the Low Income HousingTax Credit and tax credits for historic preservation (both of which willlikely remain intact), and promoting the Commercial Revitalization Tax Acttargeted at distressed urban areas and supporting a tax credit for thosewho restore historic homes (both an uphill fight).Clout through community design   Architects have influence in Congress, claims Eisenberg, because theyhelp to make ``livable communities.'' That architects are able tofacilitate public participation as well as build projects that tangiblybenefit towns and cities is crucial, because ``all kinds of legislationflows to communities.'' He cites, for example, ``the transportationenhancements'' set-aside from the surface transportation program--part ofwhat is popularly known as ISTEA [RECORD, June 1994, pages 86-89].The community-oriented focus is also seen as critical by Harvey Gantt, ofGantt Huberman architects in Charlotte, N.C. Gantt, perhaps America's mostprominent architect-politician says architects have much to offer,especially locally: ``Architects have an ability to visualize; they canunderstand the physical impact of social decisions. When I served on thecity council and as mayor of Charlotte, I thought I could visualize impactof a highway more readily than a colleague who is a sales person or alawyer.'' (Gantt has also served as Charlotte's mayor pro-tem.)That architects can create a new vision for communities is also key to whatEisenberg says are the excellent prospects for one little-publicizedlegislative initiative. The work of architects, planners, engineers, andlandscape architects in Hurricane Andrew, in Florida; the giant 1993 floodsin the Midwest; and the recent earthquakes and wildfires in California hasconvinced many in Congress that disaster-mitigation planning is critical inavoiding gigantic losses [RECORD, June 1994, pages 38-41]. In return foroffering government backing to a federally chartered private insurancecorporation, at-risk states will have to make comprehensivedisaster-mitigation plans and put in place new or upgraded zoning andcodes. Both the planning process and the construction upgrading involvedshould generate substantial work for architects. That the bill has 220House co-sponsors is important, says Eisenberg, because ``this is aCongress that is not about telling states what to do.''Architect as local peace-maker   Many architects see expanded opportunities if the shift to localgovernment and privatization continues. They agree with proponents of smallgovernment that the lower taxes permitted by less government translate intomore money deployed more efficiently by the private sector. Indeed, therehas been a long-term shift of U.S. architects' clients from government(still the dominant patron in much of Europe) to the private sector.Removing federal-government regulatory burdens may not change the life ofthe average architect much, though. Architects frequently complain that thethicket of local regulations, design-review, and community-review boardsthrough which even private-sector projects must pass too often sapsinnovation--let alone excellence. Clients also often see such activities asincidental and expensive barriers to the main event--designing buildings.Dealing with community needs shouldn't be incidental, argues Dana Cuff,associate professor at UCLA's Department of Architecture and Planning.She's made a study of what she calls ``contentious development,'' andobserves that inevitably ``architecture ends up in the political realm,when you talk about how architecture adds up to a city.'' Many architectscan bring highly developed design, graphics, and communication skills tobear in community planning and design--skills developers, planners, andreal-estate professionals often lack.Cuff looked at Riverside South, a gigantic urban development in New YorkCity first proposed by developer Donald Trump as Television City--a seriesof dizzyingly huge towers that attracted fierce community opposition.Architects, some of them working pro bono, collaborated with opponents,and, ultimately, Trump's team. The scheme approved was smaller, and vastlymore public-oriented. And Trump learned that a less adversarial approachcan work.``You can say New York is much better off in terms of quality of life forhaving had this be a 10-year, political, drawn-out process,'' observesCuff. ``No developer would ever do this if not pressured to.'' Whilejoining the opposition may not win plaudits from potential clients, Cufffeels architects' validity within the community is too often threatenedbecause ``people feel let down by architects and developers.'' She seesgreat opportunity for architects able to help owners steer projects throughdifficult community-review procedures (though getting paid for the effortinvolved remains a hurdle). She argues, ``Architects are the kind ofprofessionals that can work through--competently and with a vision--complexproblems that have both physical and political dimensions.''City builders vs privatized packagers   The tensions that arise from the level of community consultationrequired in many jurisdictions reflect themes in larger political debates.When advocates for small-government gained momentum in the 1980s, forexample, they claimed that too many architects clung to an outmodedbig-government role as community master builder imposing a personal-tasteagenda on the public. Then, as architects moved away from urban design andlow-income housing to lushly funded museum projects and glitzy edge-citymega-developments, community advocates said that the most prominentpractitioners had abdicated their professional authority, and deserved tobe considered mere packagers and stylists, pandering to the egos ofdevelopers and companies at the public's expense.This quandary for architects isn't going away; indeed, such arguments maybecome more polarized, and architects may find it more difficult to have abroad role in shaping communities while still realizing the needs andaspirations of those paying the bills. Consider two scenarios: ifgovernment is merely localized, rather than privatized on a large scale,architects can continue to help government agencies create genuinely publicplaces. But when government is privatized, then private entities, howeverpublic-spirited, become the clients, making the relationship between thearchitect and the public one more step removed. When an architect works fora developer hired to build public schools, for example, the developer setsthe priorities the architect must address rather than an agency or thecommunity. While a privatized entity can offer much more efficientmanagement and procurement, it may not feel charged to do what governmentmight do, such as look to locate a public facility in a neighborhood whereit can catalyze other development.Can architecture survive expediency?   It is also worth considering whether the extent to which government usesarchitecture reflects on the profession. In FDR's era, for example,architects were involved in work ranging from public hospitals to parkstructures to bridges--even the great Hoover Dam. Though public works fromthat era remain widely admired, today's no-frills approach has made themulti-lane freeway running in a trench of precast-concrete sound barriersthe primary experience of the public realm. One could argue that the sorrynature of much public work today reflects people's attitude towardgovernment, not architecture. But we shouldn't dismiss a more pessimisticconclusion--that people no longer see design as a means of representingtheir community's or their nation's aspirations. Do we need governmentarchitecture (which is supposed to represent us all) to help validate theprofession in the eyes of the public?Gantt, on the other hand, says the perception of public design ``goes upand down with the community. Architects should be focused on quality oflife,'' he continues. ``We can influence what we're surrounded by: how youreinforce neighborhoods, how you keep downtowns from being ghost townsafter dark.'' The more the public recognizes architects' positivecontribution to ``what it takes to produce that intangible--a city thatfeels good to people,'' he says, the more the community will ask architectsto do.Gantt urges architects to testify in front of planning committees, to beinvolved in charettes or with community groups. ``When I sat on majordecisions on how Charlotte's downtown was going to develop or majorinfrastructure developments, developers, bankers, and other people would bethere, but no architects were there talking about appropriateness.Architects are not even thought about in that light.'' In public debates,Gantt says, ``No one thinks twice about an up-and-coming lawyer appointedto some board. An architect is a rarity, though, and there's no reason forthat. It's great to be thought a nice guy who builds buildings, but inorder to get clout one has to get one's hands quote dirty in the arena ofpolitics.''The defensive nature of many of the battles architects fight--fee bidding;the clients, engineers, and builders that think architectural design is atbest an add-on--may be inevitable in an ever-more competitive age, or itmay be evidence of a continued devaluation in status. Certainly in today'spolitical environment, where first cost is the chief value, architecture istargeted. AIA's Eisenberg, like most architects, argues for the communityvalues that are represented through a selection process that focuses ondesign excellence and by construction that uses stone or wood rather thandrywall and carpet in an important public place like a courthouse. Inpandering to those who claim all government spending is waste, however,politicians regularly pick on the ``lavishness'' of materials that arecompletely justifiable in life-cycle or other terms. In such an atmosphere,only timid design makes it through.Eisenberg, for one, sees the ``devolution'' of national standards andprograms as ``a rush to the bottom,'' where local expediency precludessolutions to national problems. He sees it increasingly difficult ``to makepeople understand what architecture does.''Gantt says the purely cost-driven approach can be defused: ``I thinkarchitects in places of prominence can make some solid arguments about theappropriateness of architecture and its impact on our lives. And they canwin an argument on that level if costs and taxes are not the overridingconcern in the community.'' By being consistently involved in issues ofinterest to the community, architects ``will have an audience who willlisten,'' Gantt says, when they try to make a case for a genuinely civicarchitecture over a purely low-cost one. Gantt is making his own case byrunning for the U.S. Senate in 1996.Illustration(s):Illustration: Two Graphs: Selected Volume of Public Buildings/Percent ofPublic Building VolumeGovernment's changing priorities: Detention facilities--increasingly builtusing stock plans or design/build procurement that emphasizes delivery overdesign--may be this era's emblematic--and publicly invisible--buildingtype.

Now, delineators have gone digital: they render 3DCAD instead of illustrations; make animations instead of scale models.Very often, it is the client who wants the rendering rather than thearchitect. It is traditional for the client to pay for these as marketingtools--to get governmental approvals, pre-lease the building, impresspotential investors. Most imaging firms concentrate on high-qualityrenderings, since they have found these are the best way to get the designidea across to the client.While an animation is impressive, it tends to skip over details; plus, thecamera paths can be like a roller-coaster ride. Ayres Group, San Diego, afirm specializing in animations, finds itself increasingly sought after byinternational clients, according to Molly Scanlon, director, clientservices.In deciding whether to commission an animation, she says, ``youneed to define a purpose and an audience.'' One area Ayres and othersconcentrate on is presenting the impact of new development. Besidesdescribing the appearance of the design, computer images or animations canreadily show building heights and sight lines, view corridors, and otherdesigned responses to zoning and planning issues.Some firms specialize in producing multi-media presentations. They packagesound, text, and images on the computer with Microsoft PowerPoint orAstound presentation software. A speaker can show the images at meetingsusing a notebook computer and LCD display panel (which transforms thecomputer image into one that can be projected on a screen). Ayres Group'sScanlon says ``During construction, we'll run our animations as aninformation kiosk, instead of a `pardon our dust' sign, to explain tovisitors why they're being inconvenienced.'' Other firms offerproject-archiving services. They scan as-built paper drawings for storageon CD-ROM or tape (for easy retrieval or conversion to CAD files), and makea film or video record of built projects.Raw materials   Imaging services can start with hand-drawn sketches, design drawings,and CAD files--whether 2D or 3D. To make the drawing or rendering, theservice must make a 3D CAD drawing of your project. Obviously, the lesswork the service has to do, the less it costs, so it's to your benefit toprovide the project in electronic form. Among CAD files, the most commonformat is AutoCAD DWG or DXF. You deliver the files on 3 1/2-in. diskette,upload to a bulletin-board system, or e-mail the file directly through theInternet or through an on-line service like CompuServe.The right viewpoint   Once the 3D model is constructed, other 3D data might be added, such asdigital terrain modeling (DTM)--the computer term for the site profile. Youcan examine the model on-screen while an operator changes the angle,viewpoint, and distance until you agree on the desired point of view. Theservice will ask you for the colors and materials intended for the project.It typically has a large selection of already-digitized materials. Many areavailable commercially as ``clip-art libraries'' on CD-ROMs, such assurface textures for granite, marble, masonry, tile, and carpet.These items can be copied from the source and pasted into the rendering.Items such as trees, seating, trash containers, automobiles, and people,can also be added from standard clip-art libraries. If need be, a texturecan be created from scratch in three ways. Flat samples, such as tiles andwallpaper, are digitized using a high-resolution, full-color, flatbedscanner. For materials that can't be scanned, such as bricks, you canphotograph a sample, and use the Kodak PhotoCD process to create anelectronic image. As a last (labor-intensive) resort, the service cancreate a surface texture by using a computer ``paint'' program. Whetherscanned or photographed, the digital images become ``texture maps'' appliedto the surface areas of the 3D drawing.Since many digital-image firm principals are architects, they can producecredible surface colors and textures, even if the design is at an earlystage and materials selection isn't final. Being digital, it's easy tochange the color and texture at a later stage in the project. Foranimations, the client, architect, and imaging firm agree on the camerapath through the project.With the model's 3D viewpoints established, the file is exported to arendering program like Autodesk's 3D Studio. Here, the texture maps areapplied, the lighting parameters are defined, and the rendering takesplace. The time it takes to render depends on the quality of rendering, thecomplexity of the model, and the speed of the computer. An anti-aliasedPhong rendering (which includes textures, shadows, and lighting effects)may take a few minutes. A four- to five-minute animation can take more thantwo days to render on Ayres Group's 25 machines.After the imaging firm applies the texture maps, the client and architectare invited to approve the placement. It is at this point that you maydecide the colors or materials are not what was intended. Richard Buday, ofArchimage, Houston, tells the story of a designer client sitting in hisoffice with paint chips and swatches of vinyl and carpet. After theoperator rendered the image as directed, the designer exclaimed, ``No, no,the colors need to be darker here and lighter there.'' Working together,they changed the materials and re-rendered the scene until she was pleased.The designer returned to her office to find materials matching the screencolors.While one can see the scale and relative amount of colors and textures insuch a rendering, the subtleties of color in the real world are notaccurately interpreted by the computer screen. The color you perceive isaltered by many environmental factors--time of day, weather, reflectionsfrom moving objects, and the mix of light sources--that are hard tosimulate. Also, if the image is printed, the deviations from screen colorcan be dramatic, unless screen and printer are carefully calibrated. Theefforts in the field of CAD and illumination have resulted in renderingpackages now capable of shadows, reflections, and accurate rendering of theamount and color of light. Still, research has yet to give us tools topresent colors accurately on the screen and then output them identically onany color printer.The output   The output from the computer is generally a high-resolution, true color,Targa or TIFF file. The ``high resolution'' is on the order of 2,048 by1,526 pixels, which is four times the resolution of a typical computerscreen. ``True color'' means the monitor is set to show up to 16.7 millioncolors or 24-bit color depth. Such high resolution and color depth meansthat the size of files is very large, on the order of 74MB uncompressed.Compression techniques can reduce files to 4MB--still too large to fit on astandard diskette. For this reason, you'll need to deliver files on aBernoulli disk or other large-capacity medium.To get hard copy of the image, you normally work with yet another outsideagency. Reprographics firms can produce slides (using a digital filmrecorder), 8 1/2 by 11 prints (using a digital printer), and 24- by 36-in.posters (using a color inkjet plotter). Digital reprographics firms are socommon in all large cities that they often offer incentives for thefirst-time customer.Computer-imaging advantages   Imaging firms say a single computer rendering has no cost or timebenefit over a single illustration created by hand. It probably takes justas long and costs as much or more. The savings come when you makeadditional scenes from the same model or make changes. After creating one``database'' (the 3D CAD model), it's easy to create multiple views. Oncethe lighting is set and textures applied, it's also easy to generateadditional scenes from other viewpoints. For traditional hand-drawnrenderings, the illustrator starts from scratch for every view.What technology can't do   David Burch, of Jenkins & Associates, an architectural firm in Calgary,Alberta, points out an inconvenient aspect of computer imaging: the 3Dmodel must be complete. Otherwise surfaces don't meet and shadows fallincorrectly. In a hand drawing, you can always place a tree or other visualsubterfuge to obscure the not-yet-designed elements.The imaging firms consulted agreed that computers also cannot match thefeel and detail of a hand-made rendering. While it is easy for an artist topaint individual leaves on a tree, the memory needed for a computer to drawevery part of a tree is tremendous. The file size become unmanageable andrendering time excessive. Instead, the firms try to do 90 percent of thework in the 3D model. Then they soften the hard lines and slick surfacesusing touch-up applications like Adobe PhotoShop and Fractal Design Corp.'sFractal Design Painter.Burch warns that clients may see more in the hard lines and fully developedmodels than is actually there. They perceive an early study as a designcast in stone. Jenkins uses several techniques to make the computer imageseem more tentative: He adds a pastel wash to the background instead ofdropping in a photorealistic one; he makes the walls transparent so theclient can see into the building. And some programs permit the applicationof the electronic equivalent of ``brush strokes'' to make the computerimage look more like a watercolor. (Burch estimates 10 percent of his timeis spent in PhotoShop.)Similarly, computer animations, once the image sequence has been recorded,don't permit other viewpoints--at least until virtual reality becomespractical. Still, animation lets people see the project from a realisticviewpoint, rather than the helicopter viewpoint of physical models. You canchoose the way you view a physical model, but they're fragile and hard tomove around. For very large projects, such as the vast new cities beingbuilt in China and Thailand, animation becomes the only practical methodfor understanding the proposed site.Computer imaging's cutting edge   There's a consensus that virtual reality is still not worth pursuing atpresent. The head-mounted display, data glove, and body suit environment,while immersive, provide a rather crude image--even now, seven years afterwork began on the technology. Robert Jacobson, of Worldesign, Inc.,Seattle, builds virtual rooms by making spaces of projection screens thatallow you to be surrounded by a virtual scene. ``Ours is low resolution,but you move through at a natural pace. Others are high resolution, butslower,'' he says, adding that faster machines available as early as nextyear will make a significant difference. The University of New Lisbon, inPortugal, he says, is pioneering uses of 3D modeling for geographicalinformation systems (GIS), which could have broad application in design andplanning.Increasingly, you can choose the direction you'll move through a scene,like the popular computer game, Myst. Apple Computer's QuicktimeVR lets theviewer move 360 deg. around a single viewpoint (http://www.ap-ple.com).``We're moving into interactive, full-immersion spaces and full-motion,''says Lance Hammer, whose firm, Simulacra, West Hollywood, Calif., usespowerful Silicon Graphics Workstations to run high-end programs like AliasPower animator and Pixar Renderman (the product behind the film Toy Story).``Pure interactivity is coming very quickly.'' Hammer's firm, which beganusing computer visualization in architecture, moved away from buildings tomovies and advertising, but now finds itself returning to buildings--with atwist. A project for Dreamworks--still mostly under wraps--envisions a``real'' architectural threshold to a virtual, but architectural space.Hammer's firm is designing both.The purchase by Microsoft of the French workstation package Softimage, hesays, may soon bring extremely fast tools to desktop computers. SiliconGraphics competes, he says, ``by releasing something really incredibleevery year.''The Internet's World Wide Web is already being used as an advertisingmedium and an e-mail link. Publishers Depot at http://www.publishersdepot.com offers stock photos, maps, audio clips, video footage, fonts, andworks of art for browsing and purchase. Virtual-reality modeling language(VRML) offers even greater on-line potential. Using simple viewer software(usually offered free), you can move around a 3D object posted on the Web.Elements of the scene need not be located all on the same Internet site,which could mean that the model could be worked on and viewed by numerousparties working independently.Today, the Internet's bandwidth is too low for this kind of interactivity.(Though Caligari offers ``3D home worlds'' at http://www.caligari.com/.) Bythe end of the decade, such collaboration should be more mainstream. Oneambitious project is VirtualSOMA, an attempt to model part of downtown SanFrancisco south of Market Street using VRML at http://project9/soma.html.By using a VRML viewer, such as InterVista's WorldView, you walk throughand fly around the district.What should computer imaging cost?   No conventions appear to exist for pricing. A Canadian imaging firm drewup a proposed shopping mall in 3D CAD, then created a half-dozenhigh-resolution renderings for a total of CDN$8,000. A San Francisco firmcharges $85 per hour for 3D CAD modeling and rendering. Photo compositingis more complex than straight rendering: the computer model is pasted intoa photograph of the location. A recent project was priced at $3,800 for thefirst photo composition and $1,100 for each additional composed viewpoint.Ayres Group charges as little as $5,000 for a simple animation. Complexjobs run up to $100,000.But don't expect a happy ending to this story. The outsourcing of digitalarchitectural illustrations is not a booming business. Aside from AyresGroup, the firms surveyed were unanimous in stating that there isn't enoughbusiness in architecture to make computer imaging full-time work. Theprincipal of one firm told me, ``We are not actively marketing toarchitects, although we have done work for architects when they find us andwe are happy to do it.''To find the happy ending, these firms look elsewhere. Archimage markets toproducers, directors, and ad agencies. Simulacra did computer-generatedarchitectural backgrounds for Batman Forever (previous pages); the projectwas so demanding, the hardware required a movie-studio budget, and Aliashad to write custom software. Creative Communications takes theirexperience in architecture and applies it to visualizations fornon-architectural clients, such as government agencies and developers.Illustration(s):Illustration: Four Screens: Simulacra used film-effects tools invisualizations for the CineMania Theater (1, opposite and RECORD, August1994, pages 62-63) for architect Ellerbe Becket, and the City CenterConcert Hall in Kuala Lumpur (2) for Cesar Pelli and Associates. The firmhas gone Hollywood, adding its architectural expertise to Batman Forever(3). Jenkins Associates modeled a small spa (4). Some surfaces can be madetransparent so clients can see inside.Illustration: Two Screens: Using one computer model Jenkins Associates isable to produce numerous views of a new town plan, called Angus GlenVillage, slated for Markham, Ontario (5, 6). The different views allowpotential buyers to understand how the streets and public spaces create asense of place.Illustration: Screen: For Gensler and Associates' Los Angeles office, AyresGroup produced an animation of an expansion of San Diego's Lindbergh Field(7). The animation explains design concepts and provides a tour of theentire project. Scenes include meticulously detailed images such as the onebelow that feature complex lighting effects and the ability to see inside.About the Author(s):Ralph Grabowski heads XYZ Publishing, Ltd., which publishes the CAD++VRMLNewsletter and other publications.

Called N-12 hc, the pipe's ribbed walls feature a honeycombcross-section. This feature adds ring stiffness which serves both tomaintain the cross-sectional shape during installation and to support thesoil overburden.The pipe is manufactured in standard 20-ft lengths and 42 and 48-in.diameters. At just 26.5 lb per ft for the 42-in. size, compared to 680 lbper ft for a same-sized reinforced concrete pipe, handling and installationare relatively easy, the company says.  Pipe ends are fitted with a bell-and-spigot gasketed jointing. Joiningpipe sections involves applying some lubricant to the ends, then pushingthem together. Prior to installation, the company recommends mechanicalcompaction of the trench, which helps minimize pipe deflection.   HDPE pipe is virtually inert and can be used in aggressive environments,such as landfills and hazardous waste sites. Tight joints and long lengthsprovide less chance of contamination of the surrounding soils.   Because of the honeycomb design, the pipe can be made using much lessmaterial per ft than solid-wall style pipe. In addition, the manufacturingprocess that creates the pipe produces no waste products, the companysays.   James B. Goddard, ADS chief engineer, says it took seven years todevelop the pipe, which the industry practice division of the Ohio Societyof Professional Engineers gave its 1995 new product award. Testinstallation of ADS's 48-in-dia pipe was done by the Pennsylvania Dept. ofTransportation. It tested successfully to resist soil pressures equal to180 ft of fill.

Through the first 11months of the year, contract awards, excluding residential construction,were up 8%, according to the F.W. Dodge division of the McGraw-Hill Cos.Among the strongest annual gains were 24% for manufacturing, 14% forapartments, 49% for hotels and 10% for educational buildings. Overall,awards for nonresidential work were also up 8% over 1994's level. However,there are signs that some of this strength is starting to weaken. ``Duringthe fourth quarter of 1995, construction began downshifting from expansionto stability,'' says Robert A. Murray, vice president for economic affairsfor McGraw-Hill's Construction Information Group. ``The industry was ableto avoid declines primarily due to the resilient support of thenonresidential building market,'' he adds. Markets already showing weaknesscompared to 1994 include annual declines of 8% for sewerage, 3% forbridges, 23% for dams and reservoirs, 18% for warehouses and 27% forprisons.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,ARMY ENGINEERS BUILD BRIDGE IN BOSNIABattling winter weather and flooding, U.S. Army engineers successfullyconstructed a bridge across the Sava River in Bosnia.

But project engineerssay that regulators are forcing them to build costly improvements that mayultimately prove unnecessary.By:By Andrew G. Wright in MiamiUnder detailed and stringent state and federal mandates, Miami is spending$1.1 billion to rehabilitate the largest wastewater collection andtreatment system in the Southeast. The program, about one-third the waytoward a 2002 completion deadline, has more than doubled monthly water andsewer bills since 1988, with no expected end in sight.   To date, Miami has made all 194 milestones in the compliance orders, butofficials claim the decrees are arbitrary in places, putting constructionahead of planning and forcing costly improvements that may be ultimatelyunnecessary. The city wants the federal government to devise a sanitarysewer overflow policy that considers local conditions, particularly agroundwater table only 3 ft to 6 ft below the surface and average rainfallof 60 in. per year. Otherwise, they fear, the massive upgrade will stillnot bring the city's wastewater collection and treatment system into CleanWater Act compliance.   Wake-up call. The 400-sq-mile system comprises 2,400 miles of gravitysewers, 640 miles of force main, 874 pump stations and three treatmentplants that together process 320 million gal per day of wastewater onaverage. Peak flow tops 700 mgd. Thousands of sanitary sewer overflows,coupled with a series of pipe and pump station failures in the late 1980sand early 1990s, caught the attention of media, environmentalists andregulators.   After several well-publicized pipe failures flooded intersectionsdowntown and spilled raw sewage into the Miami River and other bodies ofwater, many began to question the integrity of a force main under BiscayneBay. The 72-in.-dia Cross Bay line is the primary conduit for wastewaterfrom the mainland to the 143-mgd Central District treatment plant onVirginia Key. It was built in the 1950s, when the city was desperatelytrying to keep pace with booming development.   In a 1993 agreement, the Florida Dept. of Environmental Protectionspecified replacement of the line with a 102-in.-dia alternative. The jobcame in a year early and well under its $72-million estimated cost (ENR9/12/94 p. 16).   But the regulators were just getting started. In July 1993, a secondpact with the state specified expansion of two treatment plants, odorcontrol improvements at the central facility, additional capacitythroughout the collection and transmission systems and expansion of adetailed infiltration and inflow program already under way.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also stepped in, filing afederal lawsuit that raised the same issues covered by the state'sregulators. The U.S. Dept. of Justice, representing EPA, refused toacknowledge the settlement agreements. Miami settled the suit by signingdetailed consent decrees, the first in August 1993, and the second inFebruary 1995. In addition to signing off on a program currently pegged at$1.1 billion, the city agreed to spend $5 million to build advancedwastewater treatment works and install reuse and low-flow toilets in publichousing. Finally, Miami paid $2 million to the U.S. Treasury, the largestpenalty ever collected under the Clean Water Act.   City officials acknowledge the repairs were overdue. But they alsomaintain the settlements with state and federal regulators duplicatepaperwork and put construction's cart before design's horse. A peak-flowstudy and system-wide sanitary sewer evaluation, both under way but not yetcomplete, would generate a more cost-effective upgrade plan by the end ofnext year, they say. The compliance documents are ``clearly a prematureenforcement of the Clean Water Act,'' says Anthony J. Clemente, director ofthe Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Dept.   ``We could spend 40% less to achieve the same goals,'' estimates LuisAguiar, the department's assistant director in charge of transmissionsystems. ``But with the agreements in place, we have no room tomaneuver.''   EPA's intervention after the state already initiated an aggressiveenforcement program in 1993 ``really was inappropriate,'' Clemente adds. Hesuspects the reason may be political, since Attorney General Janet Reno andEPA Administrator Carol Browner are both natives of South Florida. In anycase, the city says the requirements are overlapping and heavy-handed,mandating elimination of all sanitary sewer overflows, even though EPA hasyet to develop a national SSO policy. ``Will the regulatory agenciesrecognize that all SSOs cannot be eliminated?'' asks Clemente. He adds thatEPA's regional offices do not apply the same standards across the board toreleases of raw or untreated sewage from sanitary collection systems.   SSO SOS. EPA counters that it is drafting SSO enforcement actionguidelines, giving localities more say in developing management plans,says Michael B. Cook, the agency's director of the office of wastewatermanagement. ``We want to reduce monitoring and reporting requirements by25% within the next year,'' he told the Water Environment Federationconvention last October.   EPA is ``moving from a technology-based approach toscientific risk-basedanalysis on a cost-benefit basis,'' adds Tudor Davies, EPA's director ofthe office of science and technology. But he insists, ``I don't believethere are different quality criteria for water quality standards for wetweather.''   Despite EPA's promises of policy changes, the goal in Miami remains``zero overflows from the collection system,'' says Roy Herwig, anenforcement officer in the agency's Atlanta office. ``These overflows runthrough schoolyards and playgrounds. It's a public health issue.'' He addsthat fragile ecosystems in two national parks within Dade County, BiscayneBay and the Everglades, could be compromised by a large-scale failure ofthe county's wastewater treatment system.   Miami has put together ``a tremendous program,'' says Herwig, who addsthat it was long overdue. ``We felt the [operation and maintenance] budgethad been inadequate for years. It's like a car. If you never change theoil, you shouldn't complain about having to replace a shot engine.''   Clemente and engineers with Montgomery Watson, the Pasadena, Calif.,consultant leading program management for the department, say a consistentSSO policy, considering actual risks and local conditions, would be morecost-effective. ``You can engineer a brick to fly but it will be mightyexpensive,'' says Ron Ballard, MW program director.   Expense was also a concern with EPA, says Adam M. Kushner, the JusticeDept.'s chief attorney on the Miami case. The government filed suit toprotect public health, but also to secure its own investment. Miami hadused $300 million in federal funds to expand its system over the last 25years, he notes, but spent little to keep it in shape. ``We're working atthe confluence of two principal problems--unstemmed growth that limitedhydraulic capacity and a failure to invest in O&M,'' he says. ``Between1985 and 1994 we noted between 2,200 and 2,600 overflows system wide,according to the department's own records. If somebody in Miami eventhought about rain they had an overflow.''   Observers agree. ``There's no question that they were playingcatch-up,'' says Rick Arbour, president of Rick Arbour & Associates, Inc.,a Hopkins, Minn., consulting engineer that has advised EPA on Miami'sproblems.   Some of those problems date back to 1973, when the city established asingle metropolitan water and sewer agency that cobbled together a largesystem from 30 smaller ones. The clean water law provided federal funds soMiami and other cities could bring their systems into compliance.Regulators say officials found it politically expedient to take federalmoney for capital expansion, while keeping customer rates low, at theexpense of the existing pipe and pump stations.   ``Miami had one of the lowest sewer rates in the nation,'' says EPA'sHerwig. In 1988, the city billed $20.64 for average monthly levels of10,000 gal each of water and wastewater. By 1995, to fund the complianceorders, the levy had climbed to $44.22--comparable to rates in Dallas andOrlando, but well below rates in San Francisco, Boston and even communitiesin northern Florida.   Best practice? Underfunding maintenance led to massive infiltration andinflow in the deteriorating collection system. Compounding this were designmethods regarded as ``best practice'' 20 years ago, but since disproved,says Aguiar. Oversized force mains caused widespread cavitation and inseveral instances blew out manhole covers. Installing manual air releasevalves and using certain pipe materials encouraged corrosion instead ofinhibiting it, as intended, he adds.   In the late 1980s, the system started to break down frequently underpeak flow conditions. The city started an infiltration and inflowremediation program in 1991, following an agreement with the county.Extensive inspection of the system, mainly through smoke testing andtelevised line inspections, revealed the weak spots. ``We have the largestTV and grout fleet in the U.S.--16 trucks,'' boasts Aguiar.   An estimated 40% of the total flow to treatment plants during wetweather is tied to infiltration and inflow. Still, the condition ``is veryhard to quantify,'' says Aguiar. Some solutions, especially with inflow,are inexpensive and low-tech. Smoke bombs showed extensive inflow frommissing cleanout caps on private property. The owner is responsible, butthe process--notification and follow-up to secure replacement--costs $250per site, says Aguiar. It's cheaper and easier to supply crews with $3 capsand replace the caps themselves.   Plastic inserts that fit below manhole covers and seal the apertureduring storms are also inexpensive, at $7 or $8 each. Aguiar was firstskeptical these would work, ``but after putting a camera in a manholeduring a storm and watching water just pouring in, I decided to try them.''The city has installed 55,000 since 1991 and has reduced peak flows duringwet weather.   EPA wants 20% of the gravity system evaluated annually. Inspection crewsdoubled up on repair efforts, which cost 200 to 800 hours per worker inovertime last year, but ``kept us ahead of the curve,'' Aguiar says.   Fixing infiltration requires more expensive, longer-termprojects--replacing and repairing pipe. The department is encouraging afull range of techniques: grouting, sliplining, resin-impregnated linersand pipe-bursting. Still, says Aguiar, ``this country is way behind Europein trenchless technology. We're just picking up on techniques they've hadfor 30 or 40 years.''   Department crews handle trenching pipe of 20 in. diameter or less, andbid out the rest. Three projects totaling some $64 million are underconstruction. They involve 17 miles of force main and interconnections oflines ranging from 60 to 72 in. in diameter.   Infiltration and inflow work has cut peak flow to the treatment plantsby 40 mgd and eliminated proposed capacity upgrades for 90 pump stations,saving $10 million in construction, says Aguiar. But there is plenty ofpump station work in the program. Within the next three years, 358 stationsare scheduled for upgrading, along with construction of 60 miles of newforce main. Estimated cost is $195 million. All 874 pump stations will beequipped with remote monitoring equipment tied together in a SupervisoryControl and Data Acquisition system.   The consent decree establishes a design criterion for the pump stationsbased on a net average pump operating time for each station as 10 hours aday. ``EPA set forth the 10-hour criteria as a short-term fix,'' saysRosanne W. Cardoza, MW's deputy program manager. ``The peak-flow study willshow if 10 hours is correct, too much or too little.''   No time. Post, Buckley, Schuh & Jernigan Inc., Miami, is developing adigitized model of the collection and transmission system, due nextSeptember, and will deliver the peak flow management study a year later.``Houston had the advantage of a detailed water quality study that guidesthe design of their whole program,'' says William M. Brant, sewerdepartment deputy director. ``We weren't given time to do that.''   The study will extract data from the collection model to reach a singlegoal: ``to develop a capital improvement plan that will mitigatestorm-induced wastewater overflows in a feasible cost-effective manner,''says Marc P. Walch, a PBSJ engineer. The collection model will combine datafrom the pump stations and force mains to determine how much wastewater thesystem can store and transport. The peak flow study will factor in weatherimpacts. In a new twist, officials will use a so-called Virtual Rain Gauge.This computer link to weather data from satellite and ground stationreports can generate accurate storm event data every 15 minutes.   A geographic information system combines weather information andcollection system data to forecast wastewater flow through the system in a24-hour interval. As a design tool, it will yield data regardingtransmission capacity, pressure levels at connection points and possibleoverflow points within the gravity system, says Walch.   Miami's upgrade concentrates on the system's weakest link, thecollection system, but treatment plants will also be rehabbed. The40-year-old central district plant features two parallel process trainsthat dewater sludge before discharging treated wastewater 3 miles offshorethrough a 120-in-dia. outfall. An 80-mgd pure oxygen activated sludge trainwill remain on-line, but a 60-mgd high-rate activated sludge train withopen aeration tanks will be replaced by a second closed-tank pure oxygenunit for odor control. The other two plants are also slated for capacityexpansions.   Despite all the work, Miami's troubles with regulators may not be over.They are now scrutinizing injection wells at the south district plant thatare used for effluent reuse. The 1983-vintage plant, scheduled for upgradefrom 100 mgd to 112.5 mgd, injects treated effluent about 3,000 ft deepinto the Florida Aquifer's boulder zone. This lies several strata andhundreds of feet below the Biscayne Aquifer--source of Miami's drinkingwater. In 1994, a monitoring well in the Biscayne Aquifer detected ammonia,a possible indicator of treated effluent.   The department suspects a defective monitoring well. It was capped, buttraces of ammonia have been detected at other points. The department isnegotiating with regulators to develop a remediation program. ``The burdenof proof is on us to prove that we are not the source,'' says Brant.   The stakes are high, since the south district handles roughly one-thirdof the department's sewage. Any alternative to deep injection would be anexpensive proposition for a city already on the hook for one of the mostexpensive wastewater treatment capital programs in the U.S.Photograph(s):Photograph: Force main expansion mandate requires construction of 60 milesof new transmission lines.RICK POLEYPhotograph: High water table causes problems in Miami, especially afterheavy rain.RICK POLEYPhotograph: Small pipe installation is done by city crews.RICK POLEYPhotograph: Clemente says EPA pushed reforms already under way.MIAMI-DADE WATER SEWER DEPTPhotograph: Computer-operated system tells sewer line repair crews where togo and what to fix.RICK POLEYPhotograph: Brant fears aquifer contamination will trigger another decree.Photograph: Pipe repairs have added 40 mgd of capacity.RICK POLEYPhotograph: Pump station improvements involve 874 units scatteredthroughout a sprawling collection network.RICK POLEYPhotograph: Central district plant will replace activated sludge tanks withpure oxygen unit for odor control.RICK POLEYCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,CONSTRUCTION'S MAJOR EVENTS1996 -- The longest steel arch bridge  was built over the Niagara River. -- Work began on the Williamsburg bridge in New York City. -- The Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal was 77% complete. -- The 386-ft Park Row building in New York was tallest of all.1921 -- Tieton Dam, a record earthfill, was built with concrete core. -- Benjamin Franklin Bridge  in Philadelphia under way. -- First federal aid highway bill signed by President Harding. -- Work on Holland Tunnel  stalled by political dispute.1946 -- Shortages of materials hindered construction. -- The 417-ft-high John Hancock building began in Boston. -- A $448-million veterans hospital program was initiated. -- Record number of design, construction firms founded.1971 -- First precast concrete box girder bridges in U.S. begun. -- Construction wage increases run as high as 20%. -- Mobile, Ala., tunnel uses largest sunken tube units. -- Ontario bascule bridge destroys itself on opening day.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,RECESSION SLOWS CONSTRUCTIONThe year 1921 was not remarkable for construction. The recession of theprevious year continued. The value of construction in place for 1921 was $6billion, down 10% from 1920. In 1921, $1 was worth about $9 in 1996dollars. But in reaction, deflation occurred. The cost of materials, laborand borrowing dropped. By year's end, the boom of the Roaring Twentiesbegan and 1922 would show a 26% jump in volume.   For lack of private sector confidence in the economy, the bulk ofimportant construction work in 1921 was in public works, particularlytransportation. The number of trucks on the road, only 250,000 in 1916,rose to 1.3 million. Most  existing highways and roads had been built forhorse-drawn vehicles and the burgeoning truck traffic was tearing them up.   One of the highway triumphs was completion of a concrete highway betweenNew York and Atlantic City, N.J. In November, President Harding signed thefirst federal highway bill making $75 million available to the states.   Crossings. Bids were invited late in the year for foundations for asuspension bridge linking Philadelphia and Camden, N. J. Now known as theBenjamin Franklin Bridge, it was the first suspension design by RalphModjeski. Its 1,750-ft center span made it the longest suspension bridge inthe world.   Work began on the piers for the Belle Isle Bridge in Detroit, a2,193-ft-long reinforced concrete arch-type cantilever bridge. Constructionwas also in progress for a reinforced concrete arch bridge over theMississippi River at Minneapolis. It's 400-ft span would make it theworld's longest of its type. And at Fairmount, W. Va., a reinforcedconcrete arch bridge crossed the Monongahela River with three250-ft-spans.   Buildings. Because of the recession, few buildings of note were erectedin 1921. Perhaps the most impressive was the General Motors office buildingon East Grand Boulevard in Detroit. The steel-framed, 15-story buildingfilled an entire block and had 32 acres of floor space. The EquitableBuilding in New York had 40 acres of space.   In New York, at Broadway and Beaver St., the 30-story Standard OilBuilding was under way. At Broad and Wall streets, a 24-story addition tothe existing eight-story Stock Exchange was using the heaviest trusses andcolumns known so far in office building construction.   Today's growing use of steel-frame houses may have had its origins in atwo-story residence built in Canton, Ohio, with a steel frame.   Bores. The Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel, subsequently known as theHolland Tunnel, was the biggest project of the year, but mostly on paper.Disputes between the New York and the New Jersey tunnel commissions overthe location of a railroad siding at the New Jersey end of the tunnelstalled construction of the 8,500-ft tunnel for the entire year.   The Liberty Hills tunnels in Pittsburgh, with double two-lane bores thelargest highway tunnels in the country, were progressing through shale atthe rate of 250 ft per month each.   Dams. Tieton Dam, at 232 ft the record earthfill dam in the U. S., wasunder construction by the U.S. Reclamation Service on the Tieton River inWashington state as part of the Yakima project. Another distinctive featureof the dam was its reinforced concrete core wall. The concrete barrierextends from 100 ft below the river bed to the crest of the dam. It is 5 ftwide at the bottom, tapering to 1 ft at the crest. Today's Bureau ofReclamation engineers think the core was built of concrete for lack of clayin the area. The dam work also includes a 2,200-ft-long, 21-ft-diadiversion tunnel.   Wilson Dam, a concrete gravity dam with navigation locks andhydroelectric capacity, had been under sporadic construction on theTennessee River, near Florence, Ala., for three years. Congress decided toshut the job down. It would subsequently be completed and become part ofthe Tennessee Valley Authority operation.   The Miami Conservancy District's $30.8-million program to prevent moredisastrous floods along the Miami River in southern Ohio progressed. Two offive dry dams across tributaries of the Miami were completed.Photograph(s):Photograph: Tieton Dam, a record earthfill in Washington state, hadreinforced concrete core.Founded in 1921Design -- Epstein and Sons International Inc.,    Chicago -- Steinman Boynten Gronquist &    Birdsall, New York -- The Stubenrauch Assoc.

WilkinsonSevere inflation plagued the economy and the construction industry was thesource of much of it. Although dollar volume of construction was 7% overthe previous year, inflation caused physical volume to decline. Averagehourly earnings of construction workers rose 20% during the past two yearsand in 1970 increases of 15 to 20% were frequent.   Tubes rise. This was a busy year for tubular design of buildings, inwhich the perimeter columns of a high-rise form a theoretical hollow tubeto take the entire wind load. This year there were three extremely talltubular buildings under way in Chicago. The tallest of these and of theentire world was the 1,454-ft-high Sears Tower, a bundle of nine tubes. Theothers were the 1,136-ft Standard Oil Building (now the Amoco Building) andthe then world's tallest reinforced concrete building, the 847-ft WaterTower Plaza. The two World Trade Center towers in New York were alsodesigned as tubular. Ray M. Monti, construction manager on the World TradeCenter for the Port of New York Authority, was named Construction's Man ofthe Year.   Record spans. The precast concrete box girder bridge, long common inEurope, made its debut in North America. A 1,990-ft curved bridge of thistype was announced for Nova Scotia's Bear River. The Texas Highway Dept.would also use segmental construction for the main span and two side spansof a bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway near Corpus Christi.   A new method of designing steel highway bridges, load factor design,promised savings of 10 to 15% in steel.   In Germany, a box girder bridge on the Rhine River failed while underconstruction, killing 13 men. Cracks were also found in the stiffeners ofthe five-year-old steel box girder suspension bridge over the Severn Riverlinking England and Wales.   In downtown Rio de Janeiro, a 402-ft three-span concrete viaduct underconstruction collapsed, killing 24 persons.   The fastest lift bridge in North America, a double bascule over the LynnRiver in Port Dover, Ont., was supposed to open and close its leave within30 seconds to accommodate fishing boats. At the inaugural opening, anofficial hit the switch and the leaves shot up and kept on going until theyhad destroyed their hydraulic systems and their concrete foundations.   The largest sunken tube segments used so far in the U. S. were creatinga tunnel for Interstate 10 under the Mobile River at Mobile, Ala. In NewYork's East River, tunnelers were sinking four-barreled tubes to form acrossing for two subway and two railroad tracks.   A methane blast killed 16 men in the trouble-plagued San Fernando watertunnel, a 5.5-mile link in the Metropolitan Water District of SouthernCalifornia system. The first 17,000 ft went smoothly, but then minersencountered 1,400 gpm of water. An earthquake on Feb. 9 also offset theeast portal.   Clean rivers. The national interest in clean streams and the reluctanceof politicians to vote against pollution control measures produced $1.2billion worth of sewerage contracts in 1971 and a promise of $1.7 billionmore in 1972. An example of the potential was New York City's North RiverWater Pollution Control Plant, which was let for a bid of $228.9 million,the largest single nondefense contract in the Western Hemisphere.   In transportation, the Interstate Highway program passed thethree-quarter mark toward its goal of 43,500 miles.

Everyone wanted to build something. There was aconstruction backlog of $35 billion, with $1 being worth about 10  1996dollars. But there were hardly any materials or equipment with which tobuild. The federal government, which retained its wartime control ofmaterials and machinery, was intent on providing housing for returningveterans. Housing received the bulk of material.   Still, ENR reported construction contracts for $1,846 billion worth ofcommercial buildings. That was a jump of 377% over the previous year.   Excavation work began for the $15-million John Hancock Mutual LifeInsurance Co. building in Boston.   The Veterans Administration early in the year announced a $448-millionprogram to build 80 veterans hospitals in 39 states over the coming twoyears.   The U. S. emerged from World War II convinced that air transportationwould boom. In May, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 authorizedappropriation of $500 million in federal funds for airport construction.   Concrete box girder bridges were a novelty in 1946. One was built inTacoma, Wash. This was the first full year of work under the Federal-AidHighway Act of 1944.   A world record in hard-rock tunnel driving was claimed when threeeight-hour shifts of tunnelers drove 80 ft through hard granite on the BigThompson project in Colorado. Overall, there was a $1.3-billion backlog ofwater supply work, but little actual construction was expected until thenext year.   Los Angeles began construction of a 1-mile-long, 12-ft-dia outfall tubethat would carry the effluent from the Hyperion wastewater treatment plantto a distant point on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.   Construction also was in the early stages for Garrison Dam, on theMissouri River in northwest Nebraska.Photograph(s):Photograph: Veterans housing received most of the available postwarbuilding materials.FOUNDED IN 1946:DESIGN -- Alfred Benesch & Co., Chicago -- Ammann & Whitney, New York -- Architects Hawaii Ltd., Honolulu -- Baxter & Woodman Inc., Crystal Lake, Ill. -- Buchart-Horn Inc./BASCO Associates, York, Pa. -- CH2M Hill Cos.

The most impressive bridge under construction was the record-breakingsteel arch bridge over the Niagara gorge. Designed by Leffert LeffertsBuck, it boasted a span of 840 ft, making it the longest steel arch.Overall length for this railway and highway bridge was 1,268 ft. Itreplaced a Roebling suspension bridge built in 1868. The bridge wascompleted in 1897 and destroyed in 1938 when an ice jam sheared the arch atthe hinges.   Buck was also the designer of the Williamsburg Bridge over the EastRiver in New York City, which entered early construction this year. It wasthe first large suspension bridge with steel towers.   The longest reinforced concrete arch bridge in the country was beingbuilt over the Kansas River, at Topeka. It had five spans, the center span125 ft long and the spans on either side 110 ft long. It was built with asystem developed by Josef Melan in which girders curved to form the archeswere embedded in the concrete.   The Point Elice Bridge in Vancouver, B.C., a two-span Pratt trussstructure built in 1885 as a highway bridge, collapsed as an electricrailway car crossed. It was May 26, the Queen's birthday, and 55 holidaypassengers plunged to their death in the bay. A coroner's jury blamed thestreet railway company.   A forerunner of today's bridge decks was invented and patented by JohnO. Pew, of the Youngstown (Ohio) Iron & Steel Roofing Co. The Pew deck wasmade up of a series of galvanized and corrugated iron troughs that wereplaced on bridge beams and filled with concrete to a depth of 3 in. abovethe trough tops.   Big dig. The reversal of the Chicago River to protect the quality ofwater drawn from Lake Michigan was still the country's largest project, andexcavation work was 77% done. A total of 42 million cu yd of earth and rockwould have to be moved to complete the job. The end product, the 28-mileSanitary and Ship Canal, between Lake Michigan and Lockport, Ill., woulddivert the sewage-laden Chicago River from the lake to the Des Plaines,Illinois and Mississippi rivers.   The link between typhoid fever and polluted water was underlined by areport in Engineering News that the incidence of typhoid in large citieswas lowest in western Europe where water was filtered and highest wherewater was taken from the nearest body of water. Chicago ranked 60 on a listof 66.   New York was pulling ahead of Chicago as the builder of skyscrapers.Under construction in New York was the St. Paul Building, on Broadway belowCity Hall, its 25 stories rising to 313 ft. Nearby, the Park Row Buildingwould have 30 stories and a height of 386 ft, the highest building in thecity. At Broadway and Pine St. the Astor Building was planned for 21stories and a height of 300 ft.   Chicago this year pursued area instead of height and completed theChicago Coliseum, which had one of the largest single-span steel arch roofssince the buildings of the 1893 Columbian Exposition. The coliseum, 300x675ft in plan, had a capacity of 50,000 people, second only to St. Peter's inRome, at 54,000.   Subways. In Boston, the country's first subway system had been under waysince early 1895 and would be completed late in 1897. It was primarily acut-and-cover operation, made difficult by a contact stipulation thattwo-thirds of Tremont St. and all of the trolley tracks be available from 7a.m. to 7 p.m.   In New York, voters approved construction of a subway system in 1894. By1896, the system was well defined and in the hands of William BarclayParsons. Construction would not begin until 1900.   The Trans-Siberian Railroad, under construction since 1892, wasone-third completed. It would run 4,350 miles from Chelyabinsk, just eastof the Ural Mountains, to Vladivostok, on the Sea of Japan.   The finishing touches were applied to the Folsom-Sacramento ElectricPlant, a hydroelectric plant in central California that was the firstsystem to provide long-distance, high-voltage, three-phase transmission forsignificant municipal and industrial use. It supplied power to Sacramento,24 miles away. An important event for construction this year was theproduction of the first U.S.-made automobile, the Haynes-Duryea, by theDuryea Motor Wagon Co. of Springfield, Mass.Photograph(s):Photograph: Bridge over Niagara gorge, completed in 1896, was the world'slongest steel arch.Founded in 1896Construction -- The Lathrop Co.

Now, a computer method that linksoff-the-shelf CAD, animation and project-scheduling software is easing thepain, at least at San Mateo County General Hospital. The method allows theconstruction manager and hospital staff to ``see'' construction progress atvirtually any point in time during the schedule.   The costs avoided by correcting design errors exposed by the method morethan paid for its development costs. Still, most new clients won't go forit, says the construction manager.   Software development. Modeling a construction project with CAD provides``a clear way of communicating [it] to the general public,'' says GeorgeHurley, a project manager with Dillingham Construction Inc., Pleasanton,Calif. But the development costs for the software alone can be``incredible,'' says Pete Reck, an account manager with Jacobus Technology,Gaithersburg, Md., and former software developer with Bechtel Corp., alsoGaithersburg.   Trying a different approach, Dillingham contacted the Center forIntegrated Facility Engineering at Stanford University in California to seeif it could successfully tie together less-expensive off-the-shelfmodeling, scheduling and animation software. Using programs from Jacobus,San Rafael, Calif.-based Autodesk, and Primavera Systems, Salt Lake City,combined with hundred of hours of data entry, researchers created what onecalls ``4-D'' design--three dimensions plus time.   Data entry. ``Getting some architects to work in 3-D has been astruggle,'' says Hurley. To tackle the labor-intensive task of modeling the$100-million, 200,000-sq-ft replacement facility, Dillingham paid $30,000to fund the efforts of CIFE members Eric Collier, a student architect andMartin Fischer, a professor of civil engineering. The two invested 320person-hours converting 2-D architectural and structural images and datainto detailed 3-D models of the phase-one construction of the centralutility plant, plus another 880 hours modeling the shells of the otherbuildings involved in the project. The models, which included over 25,000objects, were linked to each day of the schedule. ``The costs compare tobuilding a 3-D [tabletop] model,'' says Fischer.''   Team members then created animated sequences of the detailed centralplant construction and of the overall six-year construction process. Forthis, they used a high-end Silicon Graphics Iris Indigo computerworkstation running Jacobus Construction Animation Toolkit and Walkthrusoftware programs. The output was fed to a videotape, then showed to thehospital staff for comment.   To tackle phase-two construction, Dillingham hired Frank Vaughn, a CADtechnician and designer, to detail a full food service area, including anew kitchen. Vaughn created the animation and walk-through using Autodesk3-D Studio software running on a slower Pentium-based computer.   Error checking. The modeling process uncovered conflicts between thearchitect's and structural engineer's drawings. One plan called for aretaining-wall to be 3 ft tall, while the other indicated 15 ft.Reconciling it before construction began led to savings that paid for theresearch, says Hurley.   ``A lot of design errors aren't getting caught up front,'' says Vaughnof traditional work methods. Even if only the 2-D drawings of thestructure, mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems were converted to3-D, ``hidden problems would be glaringly obvious,'' he adds.   Dillingham is currently using the modeling process on a wing of a120-bed, 71,000-sq-ft nursing facility in Martinas, Calif. Doing highlydetailed models of patient rooms has proved helpful, says Tom Trainor,Dillingham project manager. Equipment that the hospital may purchase, suchas specialized beds, is also modeled in 3-D CAD. The staff can see how itfits before it's bought, he adds.   Though the process has paid for itself and helped Dillingham land newbusiness, it is a big paradigm shift. To many potential customers, ``it's atough sell,'' says Trainor.Photograph(s):Photograph: Before: Modeling planned steelwork for San Mateo County healthcenter north addition took place in October 1993.Photograph: After: As shown here in August 1995, the same framework emergesexactly as planned, almost two years later.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,PENNSYLVANIAThe Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, Pittsburgh, has selected GannettFleming Inc., P.O.

The big change came Jan. 2 as the Environmental Protection Agencystarted sending out stop-work notices to most Superfund contractors.Carry-over trust fund money kept cleanups going through the first two weeksof the current shutdown. But those revenues ran out Jan. 2.   On that date, the agency furloughed 2,500 Superfund workers around thecountry, keeping a small crew of about 80 to manage about 60 EPA-led siteskept open because of a possible ``imminent threat'' to the public or theenvironment. ``We're getting enough funding to provide security to keep outtrespassers'' in the New York region's four Superfund sites where workcontinues, says an EPA spokesman.   Risk. Some Superfund cleanups led by a private companies, states or theCorps of Engineers also might continue, EPA officials say. But they ``mightbe proceeding at their own risk,'' because of the lack of EPA oversight,says John Frisco, deputy Superfund program director in New York.   Work was to cease at some 380 EPA-led remediation sites and 70 removallocations. Another 200 to 400 Superfund sites were in study, design, orother preliminary stages. ``It's a balancing act,'' says Frisco. ``We wantto make sure we don't shut down projects where there's environmental harmor where it will take forever to restart.''   EPA estimates that 10,000 contractor employees will be affected by theSuperfund shutdown. Those layoffs will have a ripple effect, says AmericanConsulting Engineers Council President Richard Weingardt. ``People willfeel the repercussions when their businesses suffer because engineers areforced to tighten their belts,'' he warns.   Camp Dresser & McKee Corp. Inc. received four stop-work notices lastweek, says Jonathan Curtis, president of CDM's federal cleanup unit. Hesays the shutdowns could also hurt local communities that have gainedeconomically from cleanup work.   At EPA, ``virtually all civil enforcement has stopped,'' says an agencyofficial, so no fines are being collected. ``Polluters are off the hook foran average daily total of $3 million.'' But criminal enforcement iscontinuing.   EPA also has halted writing regulations, including a proposal to reducecompanies' EPA-related regulatory paperwork by 25%. The agency hoped toissue that proposal by early January.   Still, it could have been worse. Key construction agencies such as theDept. of Transportation, General Services Administration, Bureau ofReclamation and Corps of Engineers were open. Granite Construction Co., abig Watsonville, Calif., heavy-highway contractor, has seen no impact ofthe shutdown, says spokesman Michael Lawson.   Neither has Perini Corp., Framingham, Mass., says Dick Rizzo, executivevice president for building construction. Payments have been made to Perinion several federal jobs, he says.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,CALIFORNIA SLASHES GOALSBy:David B. Rosenbaum and Tom Ichniowski   California continues to dare the federal government to stop the statefrom halving its goal for awarding transportation construction dollars tominority and women-owned business enterprises. The California Dept. ofTransportation has decided to reduce its combined MBE/WBE contracting goalto 10%, down from 20%, previously the nation's highest. Federal officialsprotested in October, and California replied in December. Now the stateawaits another federal response.   Caltrans' new goal took effect in October and matches the currentfederal minimum goal of 10%. But the message in the rollback is more potentthan the fact that the state still meets federal law. California is thecountry's most ethnically diverse and populous state. But Gov. Pete Wilson(R) has made himself the country's most visible opponent of affirmativeaction, and had made his opposition the centerpiece of his failedpresidential bid.   Federal officials remain hamstrung during a continuing legal review ofaffirmative action. ``I would say we're not happy,'' says an official atthe Federal Highway Administration. ``Legally, the Supreme Court put us ina very difficult position.''   Last June, the court's decision in Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pearedefined the legal basis for federal affirmative action programs. Thejustices ruled that those programs must now meet the same ``strictscrutiny'' test that state and local programs have had to pass since the1989 Croson decision.   Preferences curtailed. In an executive order last June, Wilson sharplycurtailed race and sex-based preferences not required by law (ENR 6/12 p.8). Wilson's order led to the dismantling of, among other things, thepublic-private Caltrans Business Council, established in 1991 to helpCaltrans implement its MBE/WBE programs. To comply, Caltrans set newaffirmative-action contracting goals that took effect in October but onlybegan receiving attention late last month. ``I think it's very unfortunatebut very consistent with Wilson's objective to eliminate affirmative-actionin the state,'' says Samuel Carradine, executive director of the NationalAssociation of Minority Contractors.   Last fiscal year, Caltrans awarded about 27% of its nearly $1 billion infederal-aid dollars to disadvantaged business enterprises, notes Jeffrey M.Reid, undersecretary of Caltrans' parent agency, the Business,Transportation and Housing Agency in Sacramento. But meeting those goalshas cost money, Reid adds. In fiscal 1994, Caltrans spent $1.8 million moreby not awarding 30 federal-aid construction contracts to low bidders.   Today, Wilson and Caltrans intend to expose DBEs to open competition. Ina letter to FHWA, Caltrans Director James W. van Loben Sels says that the``changes will require that DBEs compete more effectively based onprice.''   Still, Caltrans plans to leave in effect some local agreements, such asthat reached for the Cypress Viaduct replacement in Oakland, which has alarge minority population. The viaduct collapsed in the 1989 earthquake.Caltrans agreed to reroute the freeway replacement away from theresidential core of blighted West Oakland. The agency also agreed to award35% of the freeway replacement project's contract dollars to minority-ownedfirms and 20% to locally owned firms. Caltrans' Reid says the agency plansto honor all existing freeway agreements.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,WANTED: LANE CLOSURE PLANS   In an attempt to reduce lane closures on a major highway rehabilitationin Brooklyn, the New York State Dept. of Transportation is soliciting ideasfrom engineers and contractors. Faced with replacing 2 million sq ft ofdeck on a 4-mile-long viaduct, the agency is prepared to spend up to$250,000 for conceptual plans for ``alternative construction approaches,procedural recommendations or innovative contracting mechanisms.''   But first, interested companies must mail a one-page letter expressinginterest to reach NYSDOT in Albany no later than Jan. 30. The agency willwinnow responses and pay up to $50,000 to each of three to five firms orteams to present their plans.   ``It's an excellent idea. Engineers and contractors that have dealt withsimilar locations will be able to save the state money,'' says Jerry White,a vice president with NAB Construction Corp., New York City.   Bernard Haber, managing partner of Hardesty & Hanover, a New York Cityconsultant, says it will be important to reduce the length of time thatconstruction affects the community.   The Gowanus Expressway, Interstate 278, carries 175,000 vehicles daily,including 470 express buses during peak travel periods. The deterioratedsteel structure of the 1941 viaduct will be rehabilitated or replaced in aseries of projects expected to total $600 million, says an agencyspokesman, Eric Foster.   The state agency considered the current preliminary design to be thebest of the alternatives developed by NYSDOT and community and advocacygroups. It would rebuild interchanges to improve safety and construct a newdeck along with lighting and signs.   NYSDOT plans to start construction on the highway in 1999 and expects itto continue for six years. The agency expects to divide construction intofour prime contracts, says Foster.Photograph(s):Photograph: Gowanus Expressway viaduct to be repaired.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,DOT DISPENSES DOLLARS   States are getting $220.6 million in discretionary federaltransportation aid, but it's a far cry from the more than $1.3 billion theyrequested.   States sought $649.3 million for work on major bridges in fiscal 1996,but the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act capped thisyear's bridge allocation at $60.5 million and the Federal HighwayAdministration only doled out $57.8 million.   New York received the largest bridge share, $20 million. Half will gotowards a $100-million rehabilitation of a bridge over the Harlem River inNew York City. The city is expected to let that contract in March. Theother $10 million will help finance an $80-million replacement of anInterstate 287 bridge in Westchester County. That job is expected to be letin the fall, says a state Dept. of Transportation official.   Eighteen states sought $687.2 million for Interstate resurfacing,restoration, rehabilitation and reconstruction (4R) projects. But only sixwere winners, gaining a total of $66.1 million.   Oregon received the largest single award in any category: $25.8 millionin 4R aid to add lanes on I-5's Salem bypass and to upgrade the Hayesvilleinterchange. ISTEA mandates that U.S. DOT give preference for discretionaryaid to I-5 in Oregon and Washington.   FHWA also awarded $39.5 million for 31 public lands highway projects in27 states and the District of Columbia. Oregon again got the largest singleaward in that category: $6 million to build an interchange at Chenoweth onthe Columbia River Highway.

The estimated $86-million bridge over the Mississippi River at CapeGirardeau, Mo., will have H-shaped pylons cast in concrete for either deckdesign. Tops of the pylons will be 245 ft above the 86-ft-wide roadway.   HNTB also produced alternative designs in steel and concrete for 1,870ft of approaches on the Illinois side of the river. Bluffs on the Missouriside make an approach road unnecessary, says Maury Miller, HNTB's projectmanager.   Since the bridge spans between two states, the Illinois Dept. ofTransportation, along with FHWA, will review the designs says BillStroessner, a consultant design liaison engineer with the Missouri agency'sbridge division. Missouri has asked FHWA for a ``significant amount'' forthe bridge. The two states have not reached agreement on funding, butnormally they would share the balance after the federal contribution.   Miller says the firm performed dynamic analysis on the bridge todetermine the effect of an earthquake. The area is about 65 miles from theNew Madrid Fault, so HNTB designed for a quake of 8.0 on the Richterscale.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,JAIL TIME FOR STORE'S OWNER   A three-judge panel convicted 25 people Dec. 27 in connection with thecollapse of the Sampoong Department Store in Seoul, South Korea.

Praxair says it will sell CBI'sengineering and contracting subsidiary, Chicago Bridge & Iron Co.   No construction company has publicly revealed an interest in ChicagoBridge & Iron. One theory is that Praxair will wait until the unit'sbacklog builds up before getting serious about a deal. ``We're looking forthe best way to get the most value,'' says a Praxair spokeswoman.   Praxair made its original bid on Oct. 27, when CBI common stock(CBI-NYSE) was trading at an annual low of $19 per share. Last month,Praxair upped its offer for CBI's outstanding stock from $32 to $33 pershare. The increase apparently was enough to sway the CBI board, which hadrejected Praxair's previous offer in November and then tried in vain tosolicit other suitors. Reluctantly, the board voted Dec. 22 to accept thenew offer from Praxair.   Five senior CBI executives apparently will pocket more than $20 millionin the deal. According to filings with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the ``golden parachute'' severance payments include $9.6million for John E. Jones, CBI's chairman and chief executive officer, and$4.3 million for Lewis E. Akin, executive vice president in charge of thecontracting subsidiary.   The money is payable when Praxair formally takes control of CBI laterthis month. A spokesman for CBI could not be reached for comment on thepotential sale of the contracting unit or the size of the severancepayments payable to CBI executives.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,DOE MANAGEMENT SHUFFLE   In an action widely expected for months, the White House Dec. 27nominated Scientific Applications International Corp.'s Alvin Alm to takeover the Dept. of Energy's massive environmental cleanup program. Alm, adirector and senior vice president for SAIC's Environmental Business Area,will replace Thomas Grumbly as DOE assistant secretary for environmen-talmanagement. President Clinton Dec. 20 nominated Grumbly as DOE undersecretary, the agency's third most senior position.   Neither Grumbly nor Alm is expected to face difficulty in confirmationhearings before the Senate Energy Committee. Just how quickly thenominations will proceed is an open question. Over the past year, DOESecretary Hazel O'Leary has been heavily criticized on Capitol Hill onissues ranging widely from the administration's position on nuclearcivilian nuclear waste disposal to per-sonal spending on overseas travel.   Sen. Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who has often expressed displeasurewith O'Leary, has blocked Clinton's nominee for DOE assistant secretary forcongressional, intergovernmental and public affairs since late summer.   Prior to joining SAIC in 1989, Alm was the CEO of Alliance TechnologiesCorp. and served as the board chairman and CEO for Thermal Analytical Corp.From 1983 to 1985 he was the deputy administrator of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency.   In 1970, Alm was the first staff director of the Council onEnvironmental Quality and in 1973 became EPA's assistant administrator forplanning and management.   Alm's confirmation would clear the way for his second stint at DOE. In1977, he served as assistant secretary for policy and evaluation. Alm nowserves as cochairman of DOE's Environmental Management Advisory Board andis on the board of the Energy and Environmental Policy Institute.   Grumbly has headed DOE's environmental management program since 1993. Heleaves Alm a $6-billion-a-year program that continues to come underpressure from Congress and the administration to cut costs. Although theprogram largely escaped deep spending cuts proposed by the House last year,it is certain to come under still more scrutiny from congressional budgetcutters this year. Grumbly will retain primary oversight of DOE'senvironmental, waste management and nuclear material disposition issues.Photograph(s):Photograph: Alm returns to DOE after private sector tour.Copyright 1989 J.ARONOVSKYPhotograph: Grumbly will move up, but keep his hand in.ROBERT A.M CCOMASCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,TEXAS ENGINEERS WIN BANGKOK SEWER WORK   A group of Houston engineering firms and tunneling contractors is thefirst U.S. team to win a contract for a $2-billion sewerage expansionprogram in Bangkok, Thailand. The venture edged out ten teams ofinternational competitors to win as low bidder on the $192-million award todesign, build and operate two new wastewater treatment plants and acollection system.   The joint venture of Pate Engineers Inc. and Lockwood, Andrews & Newnamteamed with tunneling specialist BHR-Garver Inc. and ST EnvironmentalServices was awarded the four-year contract by the Bangkok MetropolitanAuthority. The group has a Thai contracting partner, Premier EnterprisePublic Co. Ltd. The contract is the third of eight that will eventually belet in the city's 12-year program to upgrade wastewater treatmentfacilities for its 12 million residents.   Other U.S. firms participated unsuccessfully. Brown & Root Inc.,Houston, teamed with Thailand's Sino-Thai Engineering & Construction CoLtd. CH2M Hill Cos., Denver, joined a team of Thai and Korean firms andFrance's Soletanche Enterprise. Earth Tech, Long Beach, Calif., bid with aThai construction partner as well. Waste Management International and theLondon-based unit of Rust International Inc., Birmingham, also competed.   ``This is a very important move for us,'' says Gerry Pate, PateEngineers president. ``We've been trying to go overseas for four or fiveyears now.'' He says Garver was already prequalified by the Thais, havingbeen on bidding teams for two previous contracts.   The treatment plants will have a total capacity of 220,000 cu m per day,with deep tunnel and open-cut sewer lines totaling 60,000 m and pipe sizesranging from 500 to 2,300 mm in dia, say team officials.

Occidental ChemicalCorp. agreed Dec. 20 to reimburse the government $129 million to covercleanup costs at the Love Canal Superfund site in Niagara Falls, N.Y. It isthe largest Superfund settlement to date.   Under a consent decree in U.S. district court in Buffalo, NiagaraFalls-based Occidental will repay $101 million to the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, which funded and directed cleanup of residentialproperties between 1978 and 1989. A leachate management system remains inoperation. Another $27 million will go to the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency, which handled emergency cleanup actions before the Superfund lawwas enacted in 1980. Occidental, which also agreed to pay $375,000 tofederal agencies for natural resource damages caused by dioxin release,``just did a turnaround,'' says an EPA source.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,PLAN WOULD REVIVE AREA AROUND WHITE HOUSE   Acomprehensive design process aims to turn the run-down area in front ofthe White House into America's ``town square,'' possibly includingeducational and commercial uses. But there is no firm plan or costestimate.   A 13-member panel, mostly architects, brainstormed in Washington, D.C.,for several days last month to develop ideas for the two blocks ofPennsylvania Ave. in front of the White House and the surroundingneighborhood. They considered more than 600 suggestions received from thepublic after the area was closed to vehicular traffic last May for securityreasons.   Although the group did not propose a specific plan, its report set forthnine guiding principles, including retaining Pennsylvania Ave. as aceremonial public way, expanding the site as a national park to encompasssome adjacent properties and enhancing the connection between the park andthe rest of the city.   The final plan could also serve as a much-needed shot in the arm to aslumbering downtown. An active town square could ``bring life todowntown,'' says architect M. David Lee, a principal with the firm of Stulland Lee, Boston, and a panel member.   The National Park Service, which assembled the study panel, will developalternatives to be unveiled in spring. The final plan is expected to bepresented next January.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,S.F. GIANTS SET TO TRY AGAIN   The San Francisco Giants have struck out many times trying to findsomewhere to play baseball other than in windswept, chilly 3Com Park(formerly Candlestick Park). The team is now seeking approval for a new$255-million plan unveiled Dec. 21. If the Giants succeed, the team willtry to become the first to build a privately financed major league ballparksince Dodger Stadium in 1962.   The Giants propose it for 13 acres on San Francisco Bay, close todowntown and public transportation, in one of the sunniest areas of thecity. Plans drawn up by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum's sports designers inKansas City, Mo., emulate HOK's designs for completed new urban ballparksin Denver, Cleveland and Baltimore. For the Giants, HOK's plans call foronly 42,000 seats, far fewer than the 70,207 in 3Com Park.   The Giants still need approval for an exemption to waterfront heightrestrictions. Opponents protest walling off the waterfront and encouragingmore traffic and parking in the area. The stadium plan ``has the basicproblem of violating the 40-ft-height limit on the waterfront,'' saysNorman Rolfe, a board member of San Francisco Tomorrow, an urban planninggroup. Still, San Francisco supervisors may put the matter on the March 26ballot.   Bay Area voters have snubbed the Giants' various ballpark proposalsbefore: four times since 1987. ``We have listened carefully to thesuggestions of San Francisco residents, and have developed an innovativeprivate financing plan which is truly responsive to their wishes,'' saysPeter A. Magowan, the Giants president and managing general partner, in aDec. 21 release. That plan counts in part on tax breaks and revenues from63 luxury suites and 5,200 club seats.   The National Football League's 49ers also wants to vacate 3Com Park. By1999, it will undergo an estimated $26-million upgrade, financed in part bythe Bay Area computer company whose name it currently bears.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,SOGGY SITE TESTS THE LIMITSBy:Paul Kemezis   Exposed slurry trench wall in powerhouse excavation is called thetallest of its type in the world.   Constructing a new powerhouse and channel in a narrow strip of landbetween an existing dam and an abandoned river course required two largeslurry trench walls. Workers then excavated between them. But installingthe walls was one of the largest jobs of its type anywhere.   The parallel structural slurry walls range from 50 to 130 ft deep. Theyare heavily reinforced and the largest panels are tied back with largetendons, says Jayant N. Sheth, senior structural engineer for theBenham-Holway Power Group, Tulsa, designer of the project. Geotechnicalinput is by the Denver office of Woodward-Clyde Consultants.   ``We believe it is the highest exposed concrete slurry wall ever builtin the world,'' says Kenneth D. Hansen, senior water resource engineer inEnglewood, Colo., for the Portland Cement Association. ``It shows how higha slurry wall can go if you use the right design.''When the Army Corps of Engineers built navigation and recreation Dam No. 2on the lower Arkansas River in the 1960s, it diverted the flow to a newchannel. So when the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp., Little Rock,decided to install a $192-million 108-Mw powerhouse at the dam near Nady,Ark., it had only the narrow strip of land to work with. The three-unit,low-head power station will be founded 100 ft below grade in a highlyplastic clay layer, Sheth says.   Designers first considered using roller-compacted concrete gravitysections for the walls, but decided slippage on the clay base would causetoo many problems. Instead, they specified a perimeter slurry trench cutoffwall to permit dewatering, with the thick structural slurry walls placedwithin it.   French contractor Soletanche Inc. used two machines with rotating cutterheads to dig down into the clay layer for the cutoff wall around the entiresite. It totals 584,000 sq ft of plasticized concrete, which reached acompressive strength of 200 psi in seven days. That work helped Soletancheformulate a mix for the main slurry trench walls, which had to achieve4,000-psi strength in 28 days.   The 258,000 sq ft of structural walls consist of 152 panels as thick as3 ft, says Sheth. More than half of them are T-shaped to provide betteranchorage in the soil. The larger panels will be structurally integratedwith the powerhouse side walls. They are connected by a cap beam and tiedto a deadman wall set back 113 ft using 132 tendon anchors with tensilestrengths ranging up to 1.8-million lb. Smaller panels are tied back by 302ground anchors with 600,000-lb tensile strength. They will be removed afterconstruction.   Hansen calls the safety features--dewatering to ease hydrostaticpressure and the complex anchoring system-- ``fairly daring.''Record rebar. Soletanche worked around the clock for four months to dig thetrenches. It had rebar cages assembled that weigh as much as 70 tons andare as long as 130 ft. Sheth calls that a record. A three-crane arraylowered them into the trenches. In total, 3,500 tons of rebar werefabricated and placed during a three-month period.   Slurry walls have been completed and excavation of 3 million cu yd ofsoil is under way. J.A. Jones Construction Co., Charlotte, N.C., will beginbuilding the powerhouse early this year. Once the new channel andgenerating station are in place, equalizing hydrostatic pressure, theperimeter cutoff wall will be removed.   The design also had to account for possible heaving and settling of theclay base layer in a range of 3 to 4 in. during excavation and powerhouseconstruction, says Sheth. The builders have installed a sophisticatedmonitoring system to track the impact of those movements on the walls.Photograph(s):Photograph: Rebar cages need three cranes to place them.Photograph: Exposed slurry trench wall in powerhouse excavation is calledthe tallest of its type in the world.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,ISOLATORS PASS TEST OF TIMEBy:David B. Rosenbaum   Ever since the 1985 completion of the nation's first base-isolatedbuilding, there have been lingering doubts about the long-term stability ofthe high-damping rubber used. Newly disclosed test results encourageconfidence in its performance. But questions remain about the ability ofisolators in general to hold up under near-field effects and so-calledseismic fling--the large displacement pulses in a major quake's initialseconds.   The first U.S. installation at the Foothill Communities Law and JusticeCenter in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., was the largest for its time. The170,000-sq-ft building owned by San Bernardino County has five storiessitting on 98 isolators; a 16-in. gap separates the below-grade first storyfrom the exterior retaining wall. That gap permits the isolators to shearhorizontally 16 in. Installed beneath columns, they have horizontal layersof steel and high-damping rubber, and are 30 in. in diameter and 18 in.tall.   Last August, workers jacked up the building for $20,000, removed twoisolators and temporarily replaced them with the original prototypestested in 1983 (ENR 9/11/95 p. 24). James M. Kelly, the structuralengineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley whosupervised the original prototype testing, oversaw the recent testing ofthe production isolators as well. ``There's always been a lot of questionsabout the mechanical characteristics of rubbers,'' he notes.   Testing of the two production isolators took place last fall at the sameplace where they were manufactured, a factory now run by Furon StructuralBearings in Athens, Texas. ``I tried to make everything exactly what it wasbefore,'' Kelly says. ``The tests demonstrated that the material haslong-term stability and doesn't change its mechanical characteristics overtime and doesn't change under load.'' Kenneth A. Taylor, San BernardinoCounty's project manager, says, ``That was something that had not reallybeen known up until this time.''   Still questionable. Base isolators have been installed under more than20 buildings in the U.S. and about 100 in Japan, as well as in Italy andNew Zealand. The cost premium--if any--depends on the comparisons; isolatedstructures generally cost more but perform better than conventionalconstruction. Compared to conventional construction, base isolationgenerally costs 3 to 6% more, Kelly figures, but ``turns out to becheaper'' for meeting equivalent performance standards.   But performance remains uncertain. The largest quake yet to affect abase-isolated structure--the relatively moderate 6.9 quake devastatingKobe, Japan, last year--struck about 15 miles from the closest isolatedbuilding.   San Bernardino County's justice center is designed for 0.7 g of groundacceleration, but has not experienced more than 0.3 g, points out Hodge C.Gaines, president of Taylor and Gaines, Pasadena.   It engineered the building before the 1991 introduction of provisionsfor isolation in the Uniform Building Code. Based on geotechnical studies,T&G designed isolators to shear a maximum of 16 in. for major quakes on theSan Andreas fault 131/2 miles away and the Sierra Madre fault zone lessthan 2 miles away.   It remains debatable whether that 16 in. suffices. One of the most vocalcritics of current base-isolation methods is John Hall, a civil engineeringprofessor at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. In itsEngineering & Science magazine last summer, he wrote, ``the near-sourcemotions being used in the design of base-isolated buildings could be toosmall, and the resulting buildings may not, in fact, be`earthquake-proof.'''Kelly intends to issue a paper in response soon. And early this year heintends to publish the results of his recent isolator tests.Photograph(s):Photograph: Base isolators removed from under building's columns 10 yearsafter installation are subjected to 16 in. of shear to test durability ofhigh-damping rubber.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,LIGHT TRAFFIC CHILLS DULLES DEBUTBy:By Tom IchniowskiWhen Transportation Secretary Federico Pea helped open the Dulles GreenwaySept. 29, he presented a horseshoe to the private road's chief executive,Michael R. Crane. Crane will need much good fortune, and a lot more riders,if his $330-million project is to succeed. The Greenway so far has drawn adisappointing average of 10,500 daily travelers, well short of the 34,000its owners projected by the end of the first year of the road's operation.   The project's slow start has already raised questions about the futureof private toll roads just as another opens to traffic. The $126-millionState Route 91, ten miles of toll lanes built into the middle of anexisting freeway in Orange County, Calif., opened Dec. 27. Officials therewill not disclose how many drivers are using the new lanes.   The Dulles Greenway's difficulties are being studied as examples ofmistakes to avoid, even by those who believe the Greenway will eventuallyreach its projected volume. In particular, toll road and transportationofficials believe the Greenway has been hindered by its lack of a marketingstudy, consumer-oriented advertising and peak and off-peak pricing.   Consumers. ``We have to understand these projects are a consumer productand we have to have research and marketing,'' says Adeel Lari, director ofMinnesota's Dept. of Transportation's Alternative Transportation Financingprogram. ``The lack of marketing may make it start slower.'' Crane says heis discussing volume discounts for local employers, peak and off-peakpricing, and strong marketing to draw more patrons.   The Greenway charges a flat $1.75 toll all day. State Route 91 inCalifornia uses peak pricing. The toll is as low as 25 cents in theoff-peak 7 p.m. to 4 a.m period and as high as $2.50 in the 5 a.m. to 9a.m. rush hour.   So far, traffic on the new lanes of State Route 91 is ``light,''according to a spokesman for Granite Construction Co., Watsonville, Calif.,a partner in the venture. The spokesman attributes the light traffic to theholidays.   Pricing is seen as a problem for the Dulles Greenway, where drivers haveresisted paying even though they get a brand-new traffic-free road. ``I dothink developers will have to be very sensitive to the price that travelersare willing to pay for convenience,'' says one federal transportationofficial.   ``I think everybody was expecting perhaps a faster buildup,'' saysMortimer L. Downey, deputy secretary of the U.S. Dept. of Transportation.Downey says the project's traffic will exceed ``their break-even point''after some time has passed and drivers test it out.   Crane concedes that the results have been disappointing. But he stillthinks he can hit the traffic target by next fall. The project's primarylenders ``were very supportive of the project and felt very stronglytraffic could achieve the end-year numbers.'' He says he doesn't foresee aforeclosure, but he won't rule out refinancing, either.   Crane's family owns 57% of the partnership that controls the toll road.It stands to gain or lose the most. Crane's mother, Magalen O. Bryant, andher family-owned investment company, Lochnau Ltd., gradually increased aninitial investment of $15 million to $68 million as the project teamstruggled to find lenders and other investors through 1993. The project'sinstitutional lenders are led by CIGNA Investments, Prudential and JohnHancock. The project's financing closed and construction began in September1993. At that time Crane said that he was looking to sell off a substantialportion of Lochnau's interest.   The 14-mile-long project extends an existing toll road and connectsWashington Dulles International Airport with Leesburg, Va. Existing roadsalready are congested. Traffic projections were prepared by VollmerAssociates, New York City-based engineering consultant. Company officialscould not be reached for comment on the toll road's slow start.   ``The traffic has been lower than anticipated, but [that's] not unusualfor a toll road startup,'' says Barbara Johnson, spokeswoman for Brown &Root, Houston, the prime contractor and 13% owner of the Greenway. ``We areseeing signs of slow improvement.'' After the Crane family's 57%,Autostrade SPA of Italy holds the biggest stake.   Brown & Root, the prime contractor, finished its portion of the work sixmonths early with no overruns, says Johnson. But the automatic vehicleidentification system is not yet in place. Crane expected the technology tobe ready by first quarter of this year, but now says he's not sure it willbe done by then. He cites ``problems with state procurement.''   Crane says he would invest in other toll roads and has formed a firm toadvise on other jobs. But he has learned lessons. ``I would never do it thesame way. I would never do it as a totally private toll road. I would do itas a public-private venture,'' with a state or Uncle Sam as partner orguarantor.Photograph(s):Photograph: Lonely toll plaza (above) shows why owners of the DullesGreenway in Virginia are disappointed while waiting for ridership to roundthe curve and exceed 10,500 a day.MARK REGAN FOR ENRCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,SEATTLE MULLS PRIVATIZATIONBy:By Stephen Daniels, with Debra K. RubinThe City of Seattle's planned construction of a 120-million-gal-per-daydrinking water filtration plant, the first phase of a $1.2-billion, 10-yearcapital improvement plan, is likely to be watched closely by other U.S.cities. The plant could become the largest design-build-operate drinkingwater facility on the American mainland.   Proposals are due this week for a consultant to help the city develop arequest for proposals for a DBO contractor for the Tolt Filtration Plant,to be located on the Tolt River's south fork. The river provides about 30%of drinking water for the central Puget Sound region. The plant, thelargest project undertaken to date by Seattle's Water Dept., would cost $93million to $103 million under a traditional design-build approach. The cityexpects to save between 10 and 15% of estimated construction costs usingDBO. A 20-year operating contract would cost an additional $60 million,says Michael Schaefer, the city's capital improvement program analyst.   Seattle is one of six major U.S. cities now using unfiltered rivers asprimary drinking water sources. It is turning to filtration to comply withmore stringent federal drinking water regulations. The proposed plant, andanother on the other major supply source--the Cedar River--also wouldimprove reliability of Seattle's drinking water system. Recent heavy rainscut off the Cedar River supply because of storm-caused sedimentation.   The project is already sparking interest among firms eager to pushprivatization in the U.S. ``There have been a lot of smaller projects, butnothing of this scale,'' says Jimmy W. Otta, vice president of CH2M HillCos., which has a joint contract with Montgomery Watson, Pasadena, Calif.,for the plant's predesign. ``A lot of people have been waiting for thiskind of project. There will be a lot of competition.''   In October, Puerto Rico awarded a $300-million DBO contract for a newfiltration plant and 50-mile pipeline to a consortium of the London-basedThames Water International, Dick Corp., Pittsburgh, and Malcolm PirnieInc., White Plains, N.Y. It is set to take effect by month's end, says aPirnie official.   While Seattle is ``still not absolutely committed to DBO,'' says onecontractor executive, the winner of the $800,000 RFP preparation contractwill assist municipal officials in comparing costs of privatized andtraditional approaches for the filtration plant. A DBO contract could beawarded in early 1997 with the facility targeted for completion by 2001.``The market is telling us it's ready,'' says Schaefer. ``It will bechallenging to see if this works within the U.S.''   Seattle hopes to create design and operating efficiencies by creatingconsortiums that will bring designers, builders and equipment manufacturerstogether early in the design process. ``We have been told by firmsinterested in bringing this model to the U.S. that this could well be thefirst of many such projects in the U.S. and that they may forego immediateprofits on this job in order to create a market niche,'' says Schaefer.   ``The interesting thing here is the operations component. There aren't alot of firms in the world with the capability to operate a plant likethis'' says Otta. ``We are seeing a lot of people who never talked to oneanother before forging partnerships and alliances.''Illustration(s):Illustration: Map: Tolt filtration plant could be a design-build-operatefacility to improve city's drinking water supply.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,BUDGET MESS STALLS OTHER BILLSBy:By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie WinstonSeveral major construction bills are on the slow track as Congress awaitsthe outcome of high-level budget negotiations.   As the 104th Congress moves into its second session this month, there isno progress on any legislation, says Dana Thompson, Sheet Metal and AirConditioning Contractors National Association director of politicalaffairs. ``Everything is sitting tight'' until the budget crisis isresolved, Thompson says.   The House has passed a rewrite of the Clean Water Act, including a newsystem for categorizing wetlands. Those wanting to dredge wetlands judgedmost valuable would have to avoid, minimize or mitigate damage. But theSenate had just begun hearings on its version as 1995 ended.   The picture was nearly reversed on the Safe Drinking Water Act. TheSenate cleared its reauthorization bill, with provision for a new staterevolving fund. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee leadersintroduced an SRF bill. But the House Commerce Committee, which has primejurisdiction over drinking water, did not produce a bill with regulatoryprovisions.   If the final budget reconciliation measure extends Superfund taxes, thatwould remove what steam is left in reauthorization proposals, at least fornow. The big sticking point with those proposals is the high cost ofeliminating pollution liability retroactively.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightENGINEERING NEWS-RECORD via NewsNetJanuary 1/8, 1996   Vol. 236,STATES SEEKING TRANSPORT BANKSBy:By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie WinstonThe Dept. of Transportation is seeking applicants for newly authorizedstate infrastructure banks.

Sant says the construction injury rate remainshigh. He argues it is important to move forward with a revised standard forscaffolding as well as a new permit-required confined space standard.   The BLS annual survey on Workplace Injuries and Illnesses, released lastmonth, reports there were 11.8 incidences of injury and illness for every100 full-time workers in construction.

The editors of ENR have chosen these 25 for newsmakingachievements covered in the magazine last year. All of those cited on thispage and the next will be honored at a Feb. 15 dinner at the Plaza Hotel inNew York City. One of them has already been chosen to receive the Award ofExcellence, ENR's top honor. That person will be the subject of a coverstory in the Feb. 19 issue.   Working in the nightmarish aftermath of April's terrorist bombing inOklahoma City, which killed 168 people, structural engineer David J.Hammond of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Jerry Ennis of OscarJ. Boldt Construction Co. led a heroic effort to stabilize the teeteringremains of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Their tirelesswork kept the remnants of the reinforced concrete office building, its gutsripped open and major sections dangling precariously, standing for morethan a month so that rescuers could search for survivors, and crime sceneinvestigators for clues.   As leader of a research team that perfected an extrusion process,Surendrah Shah, professor of civil engineering at Northwestern University,developed a low-cost manufacturing process for creating high-strength,bendable cement-composite building products. The process uses machinerythat can produce sheets, pipes, rods and structural shapes but costs 75%less than existing machines that can only make sheets.   Proving that an engineering firm with fewer than 30 people can push theenvelope, Myers Nelson Houghton Inc.'s David L. Houghton and his teamdevised a joint that resists the kind of cracking in steel moment-resistingframes (SMRFs) triggered by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Calling forside plates with fillet welds, the patented connection is the firstpost-quake SMRF joint to meet requirements of California's stringentoversight agency for hospital construction.   For an 18,000-sq-ft library with an exposed wooden truss system,architect Eliot W. Goldstein set a new standard for heavy timber structureas architecture. Facing skyrocketing lumber prices, he reworked the designto transform the two-dimensional frame into a more efficientthree-dimensional structure, akin to a timber space frame. In doing so,Goldstein sliced 35 tons of lumber from the $4-million building and addedmore visual interest. He also produced an instant landmark for New Jersey'sMontville Township.   Improving on a technique used mostly in Europe, Stephen Blaisdell ofCianbro Corp. and construction engineer Craig Finley of Finley McNaryEngineers Inc. suspended formwork on prestressed tendons to cast, withoutfalsework, arch ribs over the Presumpscot River in Maine. Cianbro was ableto cast the spandrel piers while constructing the arches. The method cutcost and schedule from critical in-river work.   Gamil Tadros, formerly with Stanley Technology Group, and GerardSauvageot of J. Muller International developed and refined precastcomponents weighing up to 54,000 tonnes for 44 gravity-base piers onCanada's Northumberland Strait Crossing. The piers minimize marine work onthe 12.9-kilometer bridge and enable the contractor to set long girders totight tolerances on elevations and alignment.   New York City engineer Shawn Disney developed an innovative plastic pierthat simultaneously solves two pressing environmentalproblems--deteriorating wharves and mounting garbage. The 410-ft-long pierhas piles, beams and decking made entirely of recycled plastic, which isimpervious to marine borers. Disney's solution offered a sound and durablealternative to wood and recycled the equivalent of 13 million milkcontainers.   L.T. Huynh of DORIS Development Canada Ltd. headed the team thatdesigned the first large concrete gravity-base offshore structure built inNorth America. The monumental base is surrounded by an innovative ice wallto protect the Hibernia oil production platform from North Atlanticicebergs. Robert Elliott, civil construction manager for NorwegianContractors Newfoundland Inc./Peter Kiewit Sons Co. Ltd., successfullyslipformed the complex shapes.   Steel erector Larry W. Davis, formerly of Canron Construction Corp.,ultimately proved correct an audacious strategy to construct a platform fora 12-story addition to New York Hospital spanning Manhattan's busy FDRDrive. Davis developed a scheme and a special rig to lift prefabricatedtruss platform sections weighing as much as 830 tons each from Hudson Riverbarges to the hemmed-in site. Platforms were placed with pinpoint accuracydespite rough waters and freezing temperatures.   Anthony Scardino, executive director of the Hackensack MeadowlandsDevelopment Commission, led development of a unique land use strategy forthe New Jersey Meadowlands to permit development in the neglected buteconomically strategic 32-sq-mile area without sacrificing fragilewetlands. The effort will spur new construction and create a $1-billion,developer-financed fund for pollution cleanup and marsh restoration in thislast large urban estuary. The plan also involves a unique collaboration ofnormally fractious environmental regulators.   Robert F. Oury, president of Rotec Industries, developed a system todeliver concrete directly from batchplants to monolith pours at Mexico'sHuites Dam. The material traveled as far as 400 meters in 90 seconds,saving money and allowing swift completion of the job.   John D. Clarkson, chief structural engineer with the Army Corps ofEngineers' Huntington, W. Va., district, revolutionized navigation lockdesign with a concept that, by halving costs on one project, will save $200million. The design places water intake culverts in the floor of a lockrather than in walls, vastly reducing the amount of structural concreterequired. It promises to become the new standard for locks.   Alcoa's $200-million cleanup of a plant site in Massena, N.Y., hasbecome a model for the private sector, thanks largely to Boyd Braniff, thefirm's environmental remediation manager. One of the largest private,single-company cleanup projects in the country, the effort covers 17separate waste sites, 37 acres of landfills and 110 acres of contaminatedlagoons. Braniff's approach to the project stresses innovative performanceincentives and unusually strong levels of communication among contractorsand regulators.   Armed with design strategies to fight fear and crime, Sarasota ChiefPlanner Sherry Plaster Carter teamed up with the police department toreclaim seedier sections of the Florida city from muggers, drug dealers andprostitutes. Her crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED)program, already a model for other cities, ensures that all Sarasotaprojects are planned with an emphasis on public safety through the builtenvironment, a powerful yet low-cost tool. In Carter's pilot CPTEDsector--the once-troubled North Tamiami Trail area--crime has dropped 29%since 1990 and investment is soaring.   Fluor-Daniel project director Ed Kirkley orchestrated a fast-trackdesign and construction effort that put a $200-million Georgia carpet plantinto operation 181 days after it was leveled by fire. Partnering andteambuilding helped slash a two-year rebuilding schedule.   Mercury Productions Inc.'s Jonathan Antevy and FMI Corp.'s Hoyt G.Lowder were the first to move practical construction applications onto theWorld Wide Web via their joint venture, the Global Construction Network.They developed software that enabled web sites, created for individualconstruction projects, to be used for partnering, real-time communication,information exchange, scheduling and cost control.   Chairman Frank T. MacInnis and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey M. Levyrescued JWP Inc. from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. They refocused the nation'slargest subcontractor, now known as EMCOR Group Inc., on its core businessof electrical and mechanical construction without jeopardizing ongoing workof construction subsidiaries.   Drawing on 40 years of experience in hydrology, Wisconsin engineer PaulJohnson designed an earthen dam and irrigation system for 4,000 citizens ofItbayat, an island in the Philippines. With no knowledge of hydraulicengineering, the people were dependent on one commercial crop, garlic,which no longer is profitable. Working with relief agencies, Johnson'sefforts, performed for free and on his own time, gave islanders a chance ateconomic self-sustainability through growing a wider variety of crops.   M.J. Nigel Priestley, a structural engineering professor at theUniversity of California at San Diego, successfully introduced to the U.S.a cost-saving method of seismic-resistant design calleddisplacement-ductility capacity analysis for reinforced concretestructures. Devised in New Zealand, it is used for designing structuralcomponents of elevated freeways. The method can shave up to 15% off thecost of new construction and more than 30% on retrofits. Unlike standardforce-based procedures, it permits determining whether bridge details infact furnish sufficient deformation capacity.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List WT03-B29-15IA059-000322-B045-227http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/cn01.html 205.156.212.5 19970114204820 text/html 61633HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:46:07 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:04 GMTContent-length: 61446Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/cn01.html Sample Issue Copyright CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE via NewsNet January 2, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEWS BRIEFS (1028 words) PREACH (from ST.

Recovered from his Christmas bout with the flu, the pope ledthe midday Angelus prayer Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 with visitors in St.Peter's Square, led an evening prayer service of thanksgiving ata Rome church New Year's Eve and celebrated Mass New Year's Day inSt. Peter's Basilica.   Christians celebrate the New Year still focused on the birthof Christ and the salvation he brings to all humanity, the popesaid during the Jan. 1 Mass.   Marking the feast of Mary, Mother of God, and World Peace Dayat the Mass, the pope said the fact that God became human meansthat human history has a divine order to it.   ``Peace,'' he said, is a ``fundamental sign of divinepresence.''   The pope said peace should be evident not only in individuallives; ``it must also radiate throughout the political order andin the life of communities and nations.''   The name Jesus, which means ``God saves,'' holds the promiseof salvation from every evil, ``particularly from hatred, war anddestruction,'' the pope said.   Pope John Paul chose as the theme of his 1996 World Peace Daymessage, ``Let us give children a future of peace.''   ``The children of the earth, at the end of this century, arethe seeds of the third millennium: For their tomorrow they ask forworks of peace and the inheritance of a united world marked bysolidarity,'' the pope said at the Angelus after Mass.   ``The little ones embody the hopes, expectations and potentialof the human community,'' he said. ``They are witnesses and mastersof hope, a sentiment they live with a joyful enthusiasm.''   ``Do not extinguish the hope in their hearts; do not suffocatetheir expectations of peace!'' Pope John Paul said.   ``It is truly important that we adults think of them and assurechildren of a peaceful future,'' he said. ``It is our task and ourresponsibility.''   Reciting the Angelus the day before, the feast of the HolyFamily, the pope said that a natural part of parenthood is workingto avoid all that is bad for one's family and to guarantee everypossible good for one's children.   But today's families, he said, which by their nature should becenters of life and love, often are exposed to ``painful threatsof every kind.''   Christian families are called to look to the Holy Family foranswers, he said. The relationship among Jesus, Mary and Josephwas one of ``authentic love and charity, creating not only aneloquent model for all families, but also offering a guarantee thata similar love can be realized in every nuclear family.''   Pope John Paul prayed that ``faith would grow in every houseand that in each home love, agreement, solidarity, mutual respectand openness to life would reign.''   The mayor of Rome and Italian political leaders joined the popeDec. 31 at Rome's St. Ignatius Church for an evening prayer serviceof thanksgiving for the past year.   The pope told the congregation that Italy, with a populationmore than 95 percent Catholic, needs renewed evangelization ``sothat the cultural and social currents running toward a radicalsecularization do not diminish the vigor of the faith held by themajority of the population.''   A state with clearly established laws, democracy and awell-ordered economy ``cannot prosper without reference to thatwhich is owed man because he is man, that is to principles of truthand objective moral criteria,'' the pope said.   Moral relativism is an ``insidious enemy'' of democracy, notits natural result, he said.   ``One must work with courage so that social structures arerespectful of those ethical values that express the full truthabout humanity,'' the pope said.ENDBack to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996TV REVIEWS CORRECTION   In TV REVIEWS of Dec. 29, 1995, correct the 32nd paragraphbeginning, The new year is ..., to read:   ...

Sick with an upset stomach and a light fever, the 75-year-oldpope canceled his participation at Christmas morning Mass in St.Peter's Basilica for the first time since his election in 1978.   When he tried to pronounce the traditional blessing and messagefor a worldwide TV audience later in the day, he was visibly shakenby an attack of nausea and had to walk away from his apartmentwindow. He reappeared 20 minutes later to explain briefly that eventhe pope gets sick.   Vatican officials said the pope was feeling much better thenext day, and by the end of the week he was walking in the centralItalian mountains. But once again papal health had become an issuein the world forum.   During Pope John Paul's 17-year pontificate, his medicaltravails have brought a new era of public disclosure at theVatican. From his assassination attempt in 1981 to hishospitalization for falls and intestinal surgery in the early '90s,the world has been able to follow his recoveries in daily medicalbulletins that have spared no details.   That's a revolutionary concept for the Vatican, which forcenturies considered papal health a state secret. Popes were alwaysin good health until the day they died; if they needed an operation-- like Pope Paul VI did for prostate problems -- they had itinside the Vatican.   But what if the pope's illness does not requirehospitalization? For the pope's flu, the press office statementswere reassuring but lacked the completeness of full medicalreports.   Off-the-record, more detailed explanations were offered for thepontiff's fever and nausea: He stayed up too late for midnight Massthe night before, he caught a chill after sweating in St. Peter'sBasilica under heavy vestments, he was feeling the cumulativeeffects of a very heavy schedule in 1995, or he caught a virusgoing around Italy.   Rome's Polish community was convinced it was something he ate,though no one seemed to want to pronounce the words ``foodpoisoning.''   Whatever the precise cause, the pope could not have chosen amore public place to feel sick, and the feedback was instant. Thepress was alarmed; the faithful were sympathetic.   He led the news around the world on Christmas, and the nextday's papers were full of dire headlines. Several quoted the popeas saying, ``I cannot go on,'' a bit more dramatic than what heactually said in Italian: ``Excuse me, I have to interrupt.''Frame-by-frame photos of the pope feeling progressively lousier athis apartment window were widely published.   Meanwhile, the Vatican switchboard was jammed with callerswondering about the state of the pontiff. But that was nothingcompared to the traffic at the Vatican's new Internet site.   Inaugurated Christmas day, the Internet ``home page'' welcomedonline visitors with illustrated texts of the papal Christmasmessage and greetings in more than 50 languages. It also offeredan e-mail box for messages, and several hundred people left them-- many giving advice to the ailing pope.   One U.S. girl named Sarah, for example, told him he should takeher father's remedy: Drink chicken broth and plenty of otherliquids. Get some rest and don't worry, she added. Others offeredprayers for the pope. The response delighted Vatican officials, whosaid they were copying many of the messages for the pope's perusal.   By Dec. 26, when the pope appeared for another blessing, thealarm about his health had largely subsided at the Vatican. He leftthe next day by helicopter for his summer villa outside Rome,looking a bit wan but obviously feeling better.   The global reaction, however, was still echoing. French BishopJacques Gaillot, a controversial figure who had met with the popea few days before to discuss his ambiguous role in the church, saidthat, in retrospect, he found the pontiff fatigued and lookingswollen in the face.   Others wondered whether he would be up to another year ofglobal traveling: He had scheduled trips to Latin America inFebruary, and later to France, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia.   As the questions lingered, the pope did not. According toVatican sources, he walked for three hours on central Italy'stallest mountain Dec. 29. Witnesses quoted by Italian newspaperssaid the papal entourage built a big fire and had grilled steaks,cooked peaches and Barbera wine.   Like all the pope's previous mountain excursions, this one wasconsidered ``private'' by the Vatican press office, which would notofficially confirm or deny the reports. But no one at the Vaticanwas unhappy to see headlines the next day about the ``mountainman'' pope back in form.ENDBack to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996BISHOPS-RETIRE (from WASHINGTON)TWELVE U.S. BISHOPS COULD RETIRE FOR AGE REASONS THIS YEARBy Jerry FilteauCatholic News Service   WASHINGTON (CNS) -- There are 12 currently active U.S. bishopswho could retire for reasons of age in 1996.   Six of them -- including two cardinals -- turned 75 last yearbut Pope John Paul II has not yet accepted their resignations.   Six other U.S. bishops will turn 75 within the next 12 months.   The most prominent of the U.S. prelates who had their 75thbirthday last year are Cardinals John J. O'Connor of New York andJames A. Hickey of Washington. The pope has asked both to stay onpast the usual retirement age.   Cardinal Hickey has been a priest since 1946, a bishop since1967, archbishop of Washington since 1980 and a cardinal since1988. He was born Oct. 11, 1920.   Cardinal O'Connor has been a priest since 1945, a bishop since1979, archbishop of New York since 1984 and a cardinal since 1985.He was born Jan. 15, 1920.   Two bishops who turned 75 last year are now the last remainingactive bishops in the United States to have participated as bishopsin the biggest church event of the 20th century, the Second VaticanCouncil, which was held in four sessions from 1962 to 1965.   They are:   -- Cuban-born Maronite Archbishop Francis M. Zayek of theDiocese of St. Maron in Brooklyn. A priest since 1946, he was madea bishop in charge of Maronites in Brazil in 1962. In 1966 hebecame the first exarch of U.S. Maronites, and when the exarchatewas made a diocese in 1971 he became its first bishop. In 1982 hewas given the personal title of archbishop. His 75th birthday wasOct. 18.   -- Auxiliary Bishop John J. Ward of Los Angeles, a priest since1946 and a bishop since 1963. He turned 75 Sept. 28.   Also 75 but still active at the start of the new year were:   -- Bishop Edward T. Hughes, a priest since 1947, a bishop since1976 and head of the Diocese of Metuchen, N.J., since 1986. Heturned 75 Nov. 13.   -- Bishop Michael F. McAuliffe, a priest since 1945 and bishopof Jefferson City, Mo., since 1969. He turned 75 Nov. 22.   The bishops who will celebrate their 75th birthday in 1996 are:   -- May 30: Bishop Norbert F. Gaughan, a priest since 1945,bishop since 1975 and bishop of Gary, Ind., since 1984. Partiallyincapacitated by a stroke in 1992, he has remained head of thediocese but Bishop Dale J. Melczek has assisted him as apostolicadministrator since 1992 and coadjutor since last October.   -- June 11: Bishop Leroy T. Matthiesen, a priest since 1946and bishop of Amarillo, Texas, since 1980. In December he hadsurgery to replace a heart valve.   -- July 17: Auxiliary Bishop John B. McDowell of Pittsburgh,a priest since 1945 and bishop since 1966.   -- Aug. 1: Auxiliary Bishop Benedict C. Franzetta ofYoungstown, Ohio, a priest since 1950 and bishop since 1980.   -- Aug. 14: Auxiliary Bishop James J.

Church law calls for bishops to submit their resignations tothe pope when they reach 75.   Pope Paul VI, who first established the retirement rules,generally accepted resignations promptly with the exception ofimportant bishops in troubled areas, such as under communist rulein Eastern Europe.   Pope John Paul has developed a more flexible approach. Hefrequently delays retirement if the bishop has an importantanniversary coming up soon, such as the 50th anniversary of hispriesthood or the 25th or 30th since he became a bishop.   Cardinals or archbishops who are particularly close to the popeor who head one of the more important archdioceses in a country mayhave their retirement delayed up to several years if they are ingood health.ENDBack to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996DALY-BRITISH (from ARMAGH, Northern Ireland)CARDINAL SAYS BRITISH INFLEXIBILITY IS MAIN OBSTACLE TO PEACEBy Catholic News Service   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland (CNS) -- Political inflexibility onthe part of Britain is the main obstacle to a lasting peace inNorthern Ireland, said Cardinal Cahal Daly of Armagh.   But the cardinal said he understood it was difficult forBritish Prime Minister John Major to exercise flexibility at thistime because of his thin majority in British Parliament.   However, it would be unfortunate if this problem led to thesuspicion that peace in Northern Ireland would be allowed to sufferbecause of British political problems, he added.   ``I do not believe that the prime minister would wish this tohappen,'' the cardinal said during a Jan. 1 Mass homily in Armagh'sSt. Patrick's Cathedral.   ``I am convinced of his personal commitment to establishingpeace in Northern Ireland,'' he said.   ``I do earnestly hope that, in cooperation with the Irishgovernment and with the agreement of the political parties inNorthern Ireland, he will succeed in bringing this about,'' hesaid.   The cardinal spoke at a time when Major's Conservative Partyhas a small majority in the House of Commons and its survival maydepend on support from the Northern Ireland Unionist Members ofParliament who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UnitedKingdom.   Another obstacle to developing a peace plan is controversy overthe surrender of arms by the Irish Republican Army as well asparamilitary groups favoring continued British rule.   The British government wants the IRA to decommission itsweapons before its political wing, Sinn Fein, can participate inpeace talks. The IRA said the turning in of arms should be part ofthe peace talks agenda and not a precondition for negotiations.   Cardinal Daly favored including Sinn Fein in peace talks as away to achieve disarmament.   He said that the principle of disarmament had to be acceptedby everyone and that the only realistic way to achieve this was forthe paramilitary organizations themselves to decide to disarm.   ``In turn, the only people whose influence could persuade themdo so are the political leaders who support their political aims,''he added.   ``It is abundantly clear that these political leaders willagree to do so only in the context of an overall politicalsettlement,'' he said.   ``It is therefore clearly necessary that there should bepolitical talks in which these political leaders take part. Ifthere are other realistic and practical ways of bringingdecommissioning about, I am not aware that anyone has yetidentified them,'' he said.ENDBack to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996ADVISORY-PHOTOS   Editors: Here are captions for photographs that were justposted on the CNS Bulletin Board System.

Not one of the Bard's more popular plays,``The Winter's Tale''is a strange tragic fantasy with a happy ending as the gods ofwhimsy intervene in the activities of mortals.   The story begins with the king of Sicilia banishing his infantdaughter because he mistakenly believes his queen to be unfaithful,whereupon the poor woman dies of grief.   His lost daughter is found and raised by shepherds who are asunaware of her royal origins as she herself is.   Some 16 years pass when, smitten with her beauty, the princeof Bohemia seeks to marry her despite his father, whose wrathcauses them to flee.   They wind up in Sicilia where the daughter is welcomed by hergrief-stricken father, all the principals are reconciled and theshepherds rewarded for their kindness, a truly feel-good ending.   As with the others in the series, the adaptation is by LeonGarfield, the animation is the work of Russian craftsmen and thevoices are supplied by British actors.   The half-hour format gives the gist of the action and theBritish delivery of the Elizabethan dialogue captures the spiritof the characters.   But it is the imaginative animation which makes these digestsworth seeing. Using stop-motion puppets and evocative art design,``The Winter's Tale'' establishes a fantasy world playfullydiverting in itself but entirely in keeping with Shakespeare'sintent.   This is what children will find most enjoyable, once past thedark, threatening beginning.   So too will adults, though it also serves as an introductionto one of Shakespeare's plays that most will never have anopportunity to read or see produced on the stage. (HH)           ``Pharaohs and Kings: A Biblical Quest,''                 Jan. 14, Learning Channel cable   Egyptologist David Rohl shows viewers where his archeologicalinvestigations of Old Testament history have led in ``Pharaohs andKings: A Biblical Quest,'' premiering Sunday, Jan. 14, 8-11 p.m.EST on cable's Learning Channel.   Traditional archeology has never found any concrete evidenceof Moses leading the Hebrew people from the land of Egypt. YetBritish archeologist Rohl claims to have found artifacts verifyingnot only Exodus but other events in biblical history.   His claims, however, are based on his controversial redatingof the accepted chronology of the pharaohs' dynasties because theydid not properly jibe with his reading of the archeologicalevidence.   In an effort to corroborate his revised chronology, Rohl triedto match his new dates with biblical events and found that he wasable to do so, at least to his satisfaction.   While the documentary shows Rohl's enthusiasm over hisdiscoveries, it also listens as his more sober peers discount themas interesting speculation but far from proven.   Viewers are not called upon to make any judgment about therelative merits of Rohl's revision of Egyptian chronology or thecontroversy they have sparked in relation to biblical archeology.   Whether Rohl is on the right track or not, the documentaryprovides an archeological tour of Egypt and the Holy Land in thecompany of a seasoned observer who brings the evidence of the pastto life.   Rohl's speculation about Egyptian clay tablets relating toKings Saul and David, the fall of Jericho and the Jerusalemresidence of Solomon's Egyptian queen are fascinating examples ofarcheological detective work.   Most spectacular is his conjecture that the Egyptian remainsof a massive statue whose face had been almost totally mutilatedis actually that of a monument to the patriarch Joseph who had ledthe Israelites to Egypt.   Though the evidence here seems pretty thin, it is in keepingwith one's expectations of Joseph's place in the Egypt of his day.   While Rohl's unorthodox interpretations of the ancient historyof the Near East may never gain acceptance from his peers, thisdocumentary about his work is a stimulating introduction to thechallenges and wonders of biblical archeology.

(CNS) -- A Colombian folk song, ``LosGuaduales,'' says: ``They cry, they cry because they also have asoul. I have seen them crying in the valleys when an afternoon windseparates them. I have also seen them happy when intertwined.''   The song speaks of the branches of a willowlike South Americanbamboo, but Father Sean Cunneen played it during his homily at thefuneral Mass Dec. 29 for Patricia Jimenez, 37, and her daughters,Erika and Vanesa, victims of the American Airlines plane crash Dec.20 near Cali, Colombia.   The mountainside crash took the lives of 160 of the 164 peopleaboard the Miami-to-Cali flight.   ``We're like the tree. We cry when we're separated,'' saidFather Cunneen, pastor of Blessed Sacrament Parish in Elizabeth,where the Jimenezes have been parishioners since they moved to NewJersey 15 years ago.   Patricia Jimenez's husband, Fernando, was supposed to have beenon the same plane with his wife and daughters, on their way tospend Christmas with relatives in Colombia, but he was delayed andhad planned to join them a few days later.   Instead he found himself surrounded by more than 700 fellowmourners at the funeral and burial of his wife and daughters.   For the family's sake, reporters were asked not to attend, butFather Cunneen later talked about it with The Catholic Advocate,Newark archdiocesan newspaper, and Catholic News Service.   He said Erika, 18, who was born in Cali, was a member of theElizabeth High School band.   Vanesa, 8, was born in Elizabeth. Father Cunneen said she wasin the middle of preparations to receive first Communion.   He said he had been deeply moved by ``Los Guaduales'' when hefirst heard the song during a several-week stay in Cali almost 20years ago.   He played a recording of it during his homily, he said, becauseit has a deeply Christian message. Like the tree's branches,``people are filled with sorrow when we must be apart but pleasedwhen we are together again,'' he said.   The words also remind us that we are happy when we are nearGod and remind us that a Christian death is the fulfillment of ourdestiny to be reunited with the Lord, he said.   ``We don't know why these things happen,'' he said of theairline crash. ``But we do know that God is with us.''   That is the message of the Christmas season, he added:``Emmanuel -- God is with us.''- - -   Contributing to this story was Jerry Filteau in Washington.ENDBack to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FILM RATINGS (from NEW YORK)By Catholic News Service   NEW YORK (CNS) -- Here is a list of recent films the U.S.Catholic Conference Office for Film and Broadcasting has rated onthe basis of moral suitability.

(CNS) -- Dolores DeBacker thinks both farmersand city dwellers should learn more about the issues affectingagriculture and how Catholic social teaching applies to them.   ``I'm not saying I'm going to change the world, but I hope tobring an awareness of food issues,'' said Mrs. DeBacker, who liveson an 800-acre farm just north of Jonesville in south-centralMichigan.   A member of St. Anthony of Padua Parish in the Diocese ofLansing, she is working with the Michigan Catholic Conference andrepresentatives from several Michigan dioceses to help build theCatholic rural life movement in the state.   Its goals include promoting an appreciation of farming as avocation and a sense of community among farmers, as well as greaterunderstanding of how national and state policies impact familyfarms, farm workers, and the cost and availability of food.   Mrs. DeBacker said there is cause for concern about a numberof trends affecting farmers, such as the dwindling number of familyfarms, the growth of corporate farming and increasing dominance oflarge ``agribusiness'' corporations, the disappearance of locallyowned and managed banks, and the sustainability of many modernfarming practices. All of these could not only mean tougher timesahead for small farmers, but also could adversely affect the foodavailable to consumers, she said.   Some of these factors stem largely from governmental policiesthat have favored large-scale corporate operators over familyfarmers. Others have more to do with lifestyle and buying habitsof both farmers and consumers that have wrought huge changes infood production and sales patterns over the past several decades,Mrs. DeBacker said.   Shifting government policies that have promoted larger-scaleand more intensive farming have left many farmers with huge debtsand raised the threshold of capital needed for a young farmer toget started, according to Mrs. DeBacker. ``Everything has gottenbigger and more impersonal, and there are fewer and fewer of usnow,'' she said.   The trend toward concentration has been especially marked whenit comes to the companies that purchase crops from farmers, shesaid. Whereas there used to be many markets for a farmer's produce,now there are five major grain dealers that operate worldwide, shesaid. ``These companies are controlling everything from the seedto what sits on the shelf.''   Farmers themselves need to have a greater appreciation of theirrole as stewards of the land, a sense of farming as a worthyvocation -- ``of creating something out of God's gifts'' -- and agreater understanding of the importance of a sense of community.``I think we need to lead a different lifestyle -- not just likethe Amish, but they are a witness,'' she said.   Consumers also need to gain a greater understanding of foodissues, and perhaps consider how they have played into the handsof large agribusiness conglomerates by their growing appetite forprocessed and prepared foods instead of cooking meals from scratch,Mrs. DeBacker said. ``People don't know how to cook, they don'tknow how to shop. These companies promote the idea that, if you buyall these things, your life is going to be easier, but it isn'teasier,'' she said.   Mrs. DeBacker added, however, that she understands that foodissues are pretty foreign to most city dwellers, because they oncewere for her, too.   Mrs. DeBacker and her husband, Frank, both grew up in Detroit.When they first decided to go into farming in 1962, they startedwith a 175-acre farm in Armada. They moved to their present farmin 1972, and eventually expanded it to 800 acres. They milk 180cows and grow corn and wheat.   Mrs. DeBacker said she is glad the Catholic Church is promotingthe Catholic rural life movement. ``I think it's the church's placeto call us to re-examine our lives,'' she said. ``I don't see howwe can just keep consuming, and not care about each other.''- - -   Editors: Anyone interested in being a part of the Catholicrural life movement in Michigan can contact Dolores DeBacker at(517) 849-9582.ENDBack to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996PIERONEK (from WARSAW, Poland)CHURCH OFFICIALS BOYCOTT POLISH PRESIDENT'S INAUGURATIONBy Jonathan LuxmooreCatholic News Service   WARSAW, Poland (CNS) -- A top official of the Polish bishops'conference cited legal and political considerations for thedecision by church leaders to boycott the inauguration of thecountry's new president, a former communist.   Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, conference secretary-general, said heand Polish primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp declined invitations tothe Dec. 23 ceremony for President Aleksander Kwasniewski becauseof:   -- A Supreme Court ruling that Kwasniewski had violatedcampaign laws.   -- Outgoing President Lech Walesa's decision to boycott theinaugural.   -- Allegations made by a Walesa supporter that Kwasniewski allyPremier Jozef Olesky had been a KGB agent.   ``The climate generated by the behavior of the president-elect,who did not react to the Supreme Court's statement that he hadviolated the law, as well as the demonstrative activity ofPresident Walesa, and the issues connected with premier Olesky -- these factors made us decide against attending the inauguration,''Bishop Pieronek said in a Dec. 28 interview with Catholic NewsService.   The inauguration was attended by leaders of minority churches,including the Orthodox Church, as well as by Vatican nuncioArchbishop Jozef Kowalczyk.   Pope John Paul II sent Kwasniewski best wishes for a ``fruitfulservice to the Polish nation's welfare.''   In a telegram to Walesa, the pope praised the Solidaritymovement that the ex-president had founded and said it hadestablished a ``Polish path'' that other nations had adopted in``peacefully rejecting the injustices of the Marxist system.''   Observers of the Polish political scene predicted a sharpdeterioration in church-state relations in the wake of a bitterelection campaign in which most church leaders publicly opposedKwasniewski.   In a pre-Christmas decision, Poland's Supreme Court ruled thatKwasniewski had given out false biographical information during thecampaign. But the court declined to order a new election.   ``The issue should be clarified very quickly, without any side-taking,'' Bishop Pieronek told KAI, Poland's Catholic InformationAgency.   He also blamed Polish democracy for allowing the formercommunists ``to grab part of the national property and become a newclass of capitalists, while at the same time permitting a partywith its origins in the Polish United Workers Party (the communistparty during Marxist rule) to legitimize itself in differentforms.''   In his inaugural address, Kwasniewski said he is ``counting ondialogue with opposition forces.''   He said that as a member of the Polish political left, hestands for ``justice, national liberties, and human rights.''   ``I am certain that the greatest contribution to agreementshould be made by the relationship of the state and its structureswith the churches, especially the Polish Roman Catholic Church,''he said.   He said consideration should be given to how church-staterelations should look in a ``modern democratic state of law.''   He said he would respect all church members who think in termsof the ``supreme interests of our common state.''   ``But I would also like there to be no doubts that nothing willbe achieved on the path of confrontation and heated emotions,''he said.   Several Polish newspapers noted that Kwasniewski, a self-declared agnostic, had omitted the traditional words ``So help meGod'' at the end of his presidential oath.   Among his first appointments, the new president named leadingsupporters Danuta Waniek and Marek Ungier, both longtimecommunists, to senior presidential staff posts.   In his traditional televised Christmas Eve broadcast, CardinalGlemp said he shares ``the doubts awakened in many hearts'' byrecent events, adding that ``political elements'' are causing fearand insecurity among Polish Catholics.   ``The policies of the church and of people of good will are tohelp each other, and not allow the evil which surrounds us todevelop,'' he said.   The formerly communist daily Trybuna said in a front-pagecommentary that ``the president and the church hierarchy can andshould act in an above-party manner, creating the space for talksbetween various circles, organizing meetings between those whostand far from each other, controlling political and socialemotions, and giving a good example of culture in public life.''ENDBack to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996INDONESIA-SOEKOTO (from JAKARTA, Indonesia)INDONESIAN ARCHBISHOP DIES OF SPINAL CANCERBy Catholic News Service   JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNS) -- Retired Archbishop Leo Soekoto ofJakarta died Dec. 30 of spinal cancer at St. Elizabeth CatholicHospital in Semarang. He was 75.   The body of the late archbishop, whose resignation as head ofJakarta Archdiocese took effect Nov. 10, was taken to Semarang'sOur Lady of the Holy Rosary Cathedral, where it remained forviewing Dec. 31.   Several government officials were among those who paid theirrespects, reported UCA News, an Asian church news agency based inThailand.   Thousands of Catholic mourners attended the Jesuit archbishop'sJan. 1 funeral Mass, at which Cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja ofSemarang presided.   Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Vatican pronuncio, was among the sevenbishops and 60 priests concelebrating the Mass.   In his homily, Cardinal Darmaatmadja said the IndonesianCatholic Church has lost a great leader and thinker who was ableto assess situations clearly.   The cardinal praised the late archbishop's determinedleadership, strong commitment to principles and courage to expressviews ``against the current.''   After the Mass, Archbishop Soekoto's coffin was taken toGirisonta, southwest of Semarang, to be buried at the Jesuitcemetery close to the tomb of his eldest brother, the late JesuitFather Antonius Soenarjo, a former superior of the Jesuit Indonesiaprovince.

Father Paul Mun Kyu-hyon, a representative of the Priests'Association for Justice and a priest of Yochon parish in ChonjuDiocese, was notified by the Chonbuk provincial prosecutor that hehad been indicted for the violation, UCA News, an Asian church newsagency based in Thailand, reported.   In 1989, Father Mun was sentenced to five years' imprisonmentafter he violated South Korea's National Security Law by travelingto Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, without official permission.   He was paroled Dec. 24, 1992, as a part of a Christmas amnesty.   According to the Chonbuk prosecutor, the Security Watch Lawobliged Father Mun to inform the head of the local police stationwhere he lived of his release within seven days of leaving prison.   Because Father Mun failed to meet that obligation, theprosecutor said, he was indicted.   Father Mun told UCA News Dec. 27 that he had intentionallyviolated the law.   ``I ignored summons letters of the police station 10 times,because (the Security Watch Law) is an evil law not worthobeying,'' he said.   Authorities must have hurried to indict him, he added,``because they did not even write the exact date of indictment.''   ``I will fight to abolish the law with any sacrifice. But (theauthorities) might feel constrained to punish me,'' Father Munsaid.Back to Headline List WT03-B29-16IA059-000322-B045-258http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/cn02.html 205.156.212.5 19970114204908 text/html 23995HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Tuesday, 14-Jan-97 20:47:07 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:46:05 GMTContent-length: 23808Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/cn02.html Sample Issue Copyright CATHOLIC TRENDS via NewsNet January 13, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES DEAR READER: The strength of small church communities "comes from a concerted (1240 words) Hunger, starvation, malnutrition: For Lent of 1996, Pope John Paul (344 words) TAKE NOTE "The territorial size of dioceses should be examined with a view (491 words) What has been learned "about the Bible and its truth" as a (314 words) NEWS NOTES Christian Arabs often are forgotten both by Muslims and Christians (103 words) Metropolitan Vladimir, who was one of two Russian Orthodox (47 words) About 150 people peacefully occupied San Salvador's cathedral Jan.

Whilethe statement focuses on small church communities among HispanicCatholics, much that it says should prove useful to other smallgroups too.   Titled "Communion and Mission: A Guide on Small ChurchCommunities for Bishops and Pastoral Agents," the statement'spublication was approved by the National Conference of CatholicBishops' Administrative Committee. One noteworthy feature of thestatement is a special section of questions to aid small groups ina process of self-evaluation.   Small church communities are not a new thing, the statementsays. They have existed for many years in the United States, "butin different forms and at times separated from the parishcommunity." This separation may have occurred "because there hasbeen little ecclesial information developed in the United Statesas to how to foster them, respond to their presence or work withthem in our parish communities." However, this situation appearsto be changing, the statement suggests.   What is significant about the small size of these communities,the statement says, is that it allows the "members to relate on apersonal level and help to develop interconnectedness andbelonging. The smallness of the group encourages concentration ofchurch life and mission, not separation from the larger churchcommunity."   The statement explains that small groups "are not simplyassociations for intimate self-disclosure and emotional support"of the members. Rather, it says, the groups "promote their members'growth through the experiences and processes in which they discoverand accept their God-given vocation."   The new statement "seeks to shed light on the potential thatsmall church communities can have in efforts to promote the newevangelization, particularly in meeting the challenge of makingevangelization new in its ardor, methodology and expression," itsays. In today's small church groups it can be seen that "a newecclesial reality is emerging ... through which we can see thecreative grace of God at work," the statement notes. It calls thesegroups "a source of great hope for the whole church."   For Hispanics, small church groups are a place in which"religious and cultural identity is affirmed," says the statement.Moreover, "the strong sense of family which Hispanics retain intheir daily living is strengthened" in these groups.   "When solidly rooted in Scripture, church tradition and Hispanicreligiosity, small church communities constitute a new moment inthe church's self-understanding, epitomizing the celebration andproclamation of the church," the statement comments. It says"Hispanics look to these communities for a credible experience ofevangelization, where the Gospel is preached and truly lived indaily life."   One apparent objective of the new statement is to link today'ssmall church communities with the larger church on the parish anddiocesan level, as well as to interrelate what is new about thesecommunities with church tradition. Here are four examples of thistheme's development in the statement:   1. "Small church communities fortify a centuries-old traditionof faith. Affirmed and strengthened in their identity as Catholics,Hispanics can better serve the larger community. Yet, while smallcommunities serve to preserve a vibrant faith, they are not simplywarehouses of religious and cultural traditions. They are truly theexpression of an emerging spirituality."   2. "The sharing of faith stories reinforces the experience thatChristian life is communitarian. Reading and meditating upon thesacred Scriptures in community helps us to understand the meaningof Scripture with the mind of the church, thus avoidingindividualistic and erroneous interpretations. This leads to arenewed link with the Christian tradition and a deeperunderstanding of the church as 'koinonia."'   3. "Small ecclesial communities can avoid the trap of beingself-serving through a grounding in their mission and throughinterconnection with other levels of church. The communitarianaspect strongly emphasizes this unity as an essential element ofbeing church. This unity forms a bridge with other communities,allowing the mission of God to flourish."   4. "Small church communities must not be seen in isolation. Theyare not another church, but part of the one church. Their majorcontribution is the new expression of Christian life. They offerthe church a new inner life. Small communities are not a newmovement in the church. Nor are they simply neighborhood subgroupsof the parish structure. They are the church itself. They are asmaller expression of the universal church. As such, the church isdeveloping new structures to allow this inner life to flourish. Ascommunities of faith and mission, they give witness to a renewalof the church's inner life."   The statement stresses the need for small church communities tobe in solidarity with the poor. "This helps the community endureand retain sight of its ultimate goal of communion and mission. Acommunity matures by being missionary; otherwise it becomesself-serving and self-destructive," it says.   The statement includes 75 questions for small church groups touse in their own self-evaluation. The questions relate to thegroups' composition, communitarian life, ecclesial role, liturgicallife, missionary thrust and ministerial role. For example it isasked: "How does the group help its members discover a commonpurpose in applying Gospel values to all aspects of theirlives? ... How is the small community linked with the parishcommunity? ... Does the community participate in the sacramentalpreparation of its members: baptism, first communion, marriage? ...How often does the community go on retreat?"   Among other self-evaluation questions, the statement asks: "Howdo members get to know the needs of the persons in the communityand in the larger parish community? ... How are the members helpedto articulate their personal faith journey and their call toparticipate in the mission of Christ to build the reign of God? ...How do the members help each other understand the group's role inthe mission of Christ? ...   "How is the Bible used in the group's gatherings? ... Giveexamples to show how the community is maturing as church.... Howdoes the community plan to give direction to its prophetic stanceas a countercultural community and servant to the reign of God? ...How are the members trained to be ministers and leaders? In thecommunity, in the parish, in the diocese? What type of training isbeing offered?"   The statement acknowledges that the growing number of smallchurch communities in parishes indicates that parishes "areproviding pastoral leadership and fostering credible structures."But the statement has a cautionary note for parishes that are notfostering small groups among Hispanics. It says:   "Other parishes could also benefit greatly from the presence ofsmall church communities. Without parish support and properleadership, small groups could arise but lose direction.Furthermore, fundamentalist groups could easily move in to fill avacuum." The statement says that "while many Latinos have not yetfound a home in our society, they have generally found one in thechurch, especially in small church communities....   "Many Hispanic Catholics are more comfortable with smallcommunities where people know one another and can interact withtheir priests and ministers on a personal level."

Nearly 800 million people in theworld "suffer from hunger and malnutrition," the pope says in his1996 Lenten message. He calls hunger "a great tragedy afflictinghumanity." Feeding those who are hungry requires sacrifices, thepope stresses. "Certainly it will involve changing our exaggeratedconsumerist behavior, combatting hedonism, resisting attitudes ofindifference and the tendency to disregard our personalresponsibilities." Thus, feeding the hungry calls "for a deep innerconversion." ...   ...Some people might object that "a grand and unachievableutopia" is demanded to meet the world's need for food, the popeobserves. But, he says, "the social teaching and activity of thechurch demonstrate the contrary: Where men and women turn to theGospel, this project of sharing and solidarity becomes a remarkablereality." The pope insists: "The earth has the resources necessaryto feed all humanity. We need to learn to use them intelligently,respecting the environment and the rhythms of nature, guaranteeingfairness and justice in business dealings and ensuring adistribution of wealth which takes into account the duty ofsolidarity." ...   ..."Patient and responsible training from childhood on" is whatleads to "authentic Christian solidarity," the Lenten messagestresses. That's how a sense of solidarity becomes "a fundamentalpersonal attitude which affects all our actions and areas ofresponsibility." What society needs, the pope says, is "a generalprocess of consciousness-raising, ... a process capable ofinvolving society as a whole." ...   ...Lent, the pope says, is "a journey of love which opens thehearts of believers to our brothers and sisters, and draws them toGod." He writes, "Each day we encounter people who are hungry,thirsty or sick, people who are outcasts or migrants." This "Lentwe are invited to pay greater heed to the suffering written ontheir faces."Back to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 13, 1996"The territorial size of dioceses should be examined with a view"The territorial size of dioceses should be examined with a viewto the creation of smaller dioceses so as to enhance the pastoraldimensions of ministry," said the participants in the Vatican'srecent international symposium for the 30th anniversary of VaticanCouncil II's Decree on the Life and Ministry of Priests. In aconcluding message to the world's priests, the participants thankedpriests for their "devotion, seen in the manifold works of each dayin which you are involved, and in your fatigue." It thanked priestsfor "the hours passed in the confessional, the time given tomeeting and listening to people, helping them to discover and liveout the plan of God in their lives." ...   ...At one point the symposium's concluding message said, "Wehave been aware ... of those priests who are alone, those testedby illness, the elderly; priests who are persecuted because ofChrist and his church, or victims of war and violence; priests whofor whatever reason live with whatever difficulty in their serviceof God and of the church." At another point the message expressed"a very special sentiment of affection and solidarity ... to allpriests who find themselves in difficult moments of loneliness, oftiredness and discouragement."   Not only should the churches "speak out honestly and bravelyagainst the root causes" of the forced displacement of the world's125 million refugees, they should also "develop the capacity torecognize, give early warning and take preventive action wheresituations are developing which may lead to" people's forceddisplacement, said the participants in a recent ecumenical meetingin Addis Ababa of the representatives of humanitarian agencies,sponsored by the Lutheran World Federation, the World Council ofChurches and the Catholic Church's relief agency, CaritasInternationalis. The meeting's focus was consistent with concernsexpressed in this area by the Vatican, which in 1992 issued a majordocument titled "Refugees: A Challenge of Solidarity," promotingunderstanding of how many refugees "are forcibly uprooted" fromtheir homes....   ..."People are increasingly uprooted because of gross violationsof human rights, destructive and unsustainable development,oppressive actions by governments and, above all, warfare," saidparticipants in the November 1995 Addis Ababa conference. Theysaid, "Churches must be analytical, self-critical and confident inexposing and seeking to correct such root causes of forcedmigration and displacement, and the sin and greed underlying thosecauses on local and global levels." ...   ...What actions are called for among the churches? The AddisAbaba meeting proposed that churches "promote educational,artistic, media and interactive communications programs" to help"church members and society at large to transcend barriers ofethnicity, race, nationality and religion, to value the dignity ofeach human being, to affirm the blessings of diversity and to bevigilant in overcoming the language and practices of hate."Intensified programs of "pastoral care and support for theuprooted" were encouraged, along with increased "ecumenical andinterreligious collaboration" in advocacy on behalf of refugees.Back to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 13, 1996What has been learned "about the Bible and its truth" as aWhat has been learned "about the Bible and its truth" as aresult of major archeological discoveries of the 20th century, inparticular the discovery of Ugaritic literature in 1929 and thediscovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947-56, was spelled out inthe recent speech Jesuit Father Joseph Fitzmyer gave at St.Patrick's College in Maynooth, Ireland. The professor emeritus ofbiblical studies at The Catholic University of America has been amember of the Pontifical Biblical Commission since 1984. "All thesenew discoveries in this century ... give us, first of all, a moreaccurate understanding of how the Bible came to be, telling usabout the historical context from which God's written word, as wehave it, actually emerged. Second, they enlighten us about themeaning of many texts that can feed our own spiritual and religiouslives," he said. For the more we learn about the Bible and thecontext from which it grew, the more we come into closer contactwith the roots of our religious tradition....   ..."Third," Father Fitzmyer said, "we learn that God's word didnot drop from heaven, in King James English to boot, but that ithas come to us from a venerable Jewish and Christian heritage,which we cannot ignore. That tradition puts restraints on how weinterpret God's written word." Fourth, he said, we learn "that theproper interpretation of the Bible can only be given when thetradition, which came into being from the Bible itself, is properlyrespected. We have learned how the ancient Qumran community hadsuch a Jewish tradition of its own, in the light of which itinterpreted God's word and produced its own parabiblicalliterature. From such a community we, as Christians, can learn thatwe too must interpret our Scriptures in the light of the traditionthat has grown out of such a Jewish-Christian heritage."Back to Headline List CopyrightCATHOLIC TRENDS via NewsNetJanuary 13, 1996Christian Arabs often are forgotten both by Muslims and ChristiansChristian Arabs often are forgotten both by Muslims and Christiansof the West.

James wrote that Mitterrand told Elie Wiesel,a philosopher and Jewish Holocaust survivor, that he had drawnapart from religion without denying God or forgetting the faith ofhis childhood. "I doubt.

The theme for the 1996 observanceis "Let Us Give Children a Future of Peace." In it the popediscusses numerous forms of violence against children. "Many of theworld's children are innocent victims of war. In recent yearsmillions of them have been wounded or killed: a veritableslaughter," the pope says. He notes that many children "are forcedto take an active part in" wars, which can compromise thesechildren's futures in unrelenting ways. Other forms of violenceagainst children also are discussed, including violence in the homeor the buying and selling of children for purposes of the drugtrade or prostitution. "If children are properly helped and loved,they themselves can become peacemakers," Pope John Paul says. "Itcan hardly be hoped that children will one day be able to build abetter world unless there is a specific commitment to theireducation for peace. Children need to 'learn peace': It is theirright and one which cannot be disregarded," he writes. The rolesof the family and of schools are discussed by the pope. "The familymust be for children the first school of peace," he says. Inschools, he adds, children need to learn the history of peace andnot simply the history of victory and defeat in war." The Vatican'sEnglish text of the message follows.   1. At the end of 1994, the International Year of the Family, Iwrote a letter to the children of the whole world asking them topray that humanity would increasingly become God's family, livingin harmony and peace. I have frequently expressed my heartfeltconcern for children who are victims of armed conflicts and otherkinds of violence, and I have not failed to call these serioussituations to the attention of world public opinion.   At the beginning of this new year, my thoughts turn once againto children and to their legitimate hope for love and peace. I feelbound to mention in a particular way children who are suffering andthose who often grow to adulthood without ever having experiencedpeace. Children's faces should always be happy and trusting, butat times they are full of sadness and fear: How much have thesechildren already seen and suffered in the course of their shortlives!   Let us give children a future of peace! This is the confidentappeal which I make to men and women of good will, and I inviteeveryone to help children to grow up in an environment of authenticpeace. This is their right, and it is our duty.Children Who Are Victims of War   2. I begin by thinking of the great crowds of children whom Ihave met during the years of my pontificate, especially during myapostolic visits to every continent: joyful children who are fullof happiness. My thoughts turn to them at the beginning of this newyear. It is my hope that all children of the world will be able tobegin 1996 in happiness and to enjoy a peaceful childhood with thehelp of responsible adults.   I pray that everywhere a harmonious relationship between adultsand children will promote a climate of peace and authenticwell-being. Sadly, many of the world's children are innocentvictims of war. In recent years millions of them have been woundedor killed: a veritable slaughter.   The special protection accorded to children by internationallaw(1) has been widely disregarded, and the dramatic increase ofregional and interethnic conflicts has made it difficult toimplement the protective measures called for by humanitarianregulations. Children have even become targets of snipers, theirschools deliberately destroyed and the hospitals where they arecared for bombed. In the face of such horrendous misdeeds, how canwe fail to speak out with one voice in condemnation? The deliberatekilling of a child is one of the most disturbing signs of thebreakdown of all respect for human life.(2)   In addition to the children who have been killed, my thoughtsalso turn to those who have been maimed during or after theseconflicts. I likewise think of young people who are systematicallyhunted down, raped or killed during so-called "ethnic cleansings."   3. Children are not only victims of the violence of wars; manyare forced to take an active part in them. In some countries of theworld it has come to the point where even very young boys and girlsare compelled to serve in the army of the warring parties. Enticedby the promise of food and schooling, they are confined to remotecamps where they suffer hunger and abuse and are encouraged to killeven people from their own villages. Often they are sent ahead toclear minefields. Clearly, the life of children has little valuefor those who use them in this way!   The future of young people who have taken up arms is oftencompromised. After years of military service, some are simplydischarged and sent home, where they often fail to fit intocivilian life. Others, ashamed of having survived when theircompanions have not, frequently end up as criminals or drugaddicts. Who knows what nightmares must continue to afflict them!Will their minds ever be free of the memories of violence anddeath?   The humanitarian and religious organizations which attempt torelieve these inhuman sufferings deserve heartfelt respect. Thanksare also owed to those generous individuals and families whowelcome orphans with love and do everything they can to heal theirtraumas and to help them to fit once more into the communities fromwhich they came.   4. The memory of the millions of children who have been killedand the sad faces of so many others who are suffering compel us totake every possible measure to safeguard or re-establish peace andto bring conflicts and wars to an end.   Before the Fourth World Conference on Women, which took placein Beijing last September, I asked Catholic charitable andeducational institutions to adopt a coordinated strategy whichgives priority to issues concerning girls and young women,especially those most in need.(3) Now I wish to renew that appealand to extend it in a special way to Catholic institutions andorganizations which deal with children. I ask them to help girlswho have suffered as a result of war and violence, to teach boysto acknowledge and respect the dignity of women, and to help allchildren to rediscover the tenderness of the love of God, who tookflesh, and who, by dying, left the world the gift of his peace (cf.Jn 14:27).   I will continue to point out that all, from the most prominentinternational organizations to local associations, from heads ofstate to ordinary citizens, in everyday actions and at the mostsignificant moments of life, are called upon to make a contributionto peace and to give no support to war.Children Who Are Victims ofVarious Forms of Violence   5. Millions of children suffer from other kinds of violencepresent both in poverty-stricken and in developed societies. Thesekinds of violence are often less obvious, but they are no lessterrible.   The International Summit for Social Development which took placethis year in Copenhagen stressed the connection between poverty andviolence,(4) and on that occasion states committed themselves toa greater battle against poverty through initiatives at thenational level, beginning in 1996.(5) Similar suggestions were madeby the earlier world conference of the United Nations on children,held in New York in 1990. Poverty is indeed the cause of inhumanliving and working conditions. In some countries children areforced to work at a tender age and are often badly treated, harshlypunished and paid absurdly low wages. Because they have no way ofasserting their rights, they are the easiest to blackmail andexploit.   In other circumstances children are bought and sold(6) so thatthey can be used for begging or, even worse, forced intoprostitution, as in the case of so-called "sex tourism." Thisutterly despicable trade degrades not only those who take part init but also those who in any way promote it. Some do not hesitateto enlist children in criminal activities, especially the sellingof narcotics, thus exposing them to the risk of personalinvolvement in drug use.   Many children end up with the street as their only home. Havingrun away, or having been abandoned by their families, or neverhaving known a family environment, these young people live by theirwits and in a state of total neglect, and they are considered bymany as refuse to be eliminated.   6. Sadly, violence toward children is found even in wealthy andaffluent families. Such cases are infrequent, but it is importantnot to overlook them. Sometimes children are taken advantage of andsuffer abuse within the home itself at the hands of people whomthey should be able to trust, to the detriment of theirdevelopment.   Many children are also compelled to endure the trauma caused byfighting between their parents or by the actual breakup of thefamily. Concern for the children's welfare does not preventsolutions which are often dictated by the selfishness and hypocrisyof adults. Behind an appearance of normality and peacefulness,masked even further by an abundance of material possessions,children are at times forced to grow up in dismal loneliness,without firm and loving guidance and a suitable moral formation.Left to themselves, such children usually find their main contactwith reality in television programs, which often present unreal andimmoral situations which they are still too young to assessproperly.   It is no wonder if this kind of widespread and perniciousviolence also has its effect on their young hearts, changing theirnatural enthusiasm into disillusionment or cynicism, and theirinstinctive goodness into indifference or selfishness. When youngpeople chase after false ideals, they can experience bitterness andhumiliation, hostility and hatred, absorbing the discontent andemptiness all around them. Everyone is well aware of how childhoodexperiences can have profound and sometimes irreparableconsequences on an individual's whole life.   It can hardly be hoped that children will one day be able tobuild a better world unless there is a specific commitment to theireducation for peace. Children need to "learn peace": It is theirright, and one which cannot be disregarded.Children and Hope for Peace   7. I have sought to emphasize strongly the often tragicconditions in which many children are living today. I consider thismy duty: They will be the adults of the third millennium. But Ihave no intention of yielding to pessimism or ignoring the signsof hope. How can I fail to mention, for example, the many familiesin every part of the world in which children grow up in anatmosphere of peace? And how can we not note the efforts being madeby so many individuals and organizations to enable children indifficulty to grow up in peace and happiness? Public and privateassociations, individual families and particular communities havetaken initiatives, the only purpose of which is to help childrenwho have suffered some traumatic event to return to a normal life.In particular, educational programs have been developed forencouraging children and young people to use fully their personaltalents in order to become true peacemakers.   There is also a growing awareness in the international communitywhich, in recent years, despite difficulties and hesitation, hasmade efforts to deal decisively and systematically with problemsconnected with childhood.   The results achieved thus far encourage us to continue thesepraiseworthy endeavors. If children are properly helped and loved,they themselves can become peacemakers, builders of a world offraternity and solidarity. With their enthusiasm and youthfulidealism, young people can become "witnesses" and "teachers" ofhope and peace to adults. Lest these possibilities be lost,children should be offered, in a way adapted to their individualneeds, every opportunity for a balanced personal growth.   A peaceful childhood will enable boys and girls to face thefuture with confidence. Let no one stifle their joyful enthusiasmand hope!Children in the School of Peace   8. Little children very soon learn about life. They watch andimitate the behavior of adults. They rapidly learn love and respectfor others, but they also quickly absorb the poison of violence andhatred. Family experiences strongly condition the attitudes whichchildren will assume as adults. Consequently, if the family is theplace where children first encounter the world, the family must befor children the first school of peace.   Parents have an extraordinary opportunity to help their sons anddaughters to become aware of this great treasure: the witness oftheir mutual love. It is by loving each other that they enable thechild, from the very first moment of its existence, to grow up inpeaceful surroundings, imbued with the positive values which makeup the family's true heritage: mutual respect and acceptance,listening, sharing, generosity, forgiveness. Thanks to the senseof working together which these values foster, they provide a trueeducation for peace and make the child, from its earliest years,an active builder of peace.   Children share with their parents and brothers and sisters theexperience of life and hope. They see how life's inevitable trialsare met with humility and courage, and they grow up in anatmosphere of esteem for others and respect for opinions differentfrom their own.   It is above all in the home that, before ever a word is spoken,children should experience God's love in the love which surroundsthem. In the family they learn that God wants peace and mutualunderstanding among all human beings, who are called to be onegreat family.   9. Besides the basic education provided by the family, childrenhave a right to a specific training for peace at school and inother educational settings. These institutions have a duty to leadchildren gradually to understand the nature and demands of peacewithin their world and culture. Children need to learn the historyof peace and not simply the history of victory and defeat in war.   Let us show them examples of peace and not just examples ofviolence! Fortunately, many positive examples of this can be foundin every culture and period of history. Suitable new educationalopportunities must be created, especially in those situations wherecultural and moral poverty has been most oppressive. Everythingpossible should be done to help children to become messengers ofpeace.   Children are not a burden on society; they are not a means ofprofit or people without rights. Children are precious members ofthe human family, for they embody its hopes, its expectations andits potential.Jesus, the Way of Peace   10. Peace is a gift of God; but men and women must first acceptthis gift in order to build a peaceful world. People can do thisonly if they have a childlike simplicity of heart. This is one ofthe most profound and paradoxical aspects of the Christian message:To become childlike is more than just a moral requirement, but adimension of the mystery of the incarnation itself.   The Son of God did not come in power and glory, as he will atthe end of the world, but as a child, needy and poor. Fully sharingour human condition in all things but sin (cf. Hb. 4:15), he alsotook on the frailty and hope for the future which are part of beinga child. After that decisive moment for the history of humanity,to despise childhood means to despise the one who showed thegreatness of his love by humbling himself and forsaking all gloryin order to redeem mankind.   Jesus identified with the little ones. When the apostles werearguing about who was the greatest, he "took a child and put himby his side, and said to them, 'Whoever receives this child in myname, receives me; and whoever receives me receives him who sentme"' (Lk. 9:47-48). The Lord also forcefully warned us againstgiving scandal to children: "Whoever causes one of these littleones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to havea great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in thedepth of the sea" (Mt. 18:6).   Jesus asked the disciples to become "children" again. When theytried to turn away the little ones who were pressing in upon himhe said indignantly: "Let the children come to me, do not hinderthem; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you,whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall notenter it" (Mk. 10:14-15). Jesus thus turned around our way ofthinking. Adults need to learn from children the ways of God:Seeing children's capacity for complete trust, adults can learn tocry out with true confidence, "Abba, Father!"   11. To become like a little child -- with complete trust in theFather and with the meekness taught by the Gospel -- is not onlyan ethical imperative; it is a reason for hope. Even where thedifficulties are so great as to lead to discouragement and thepower of evil so overwhelming as to dishearten, those who canrediscover the simplicity of a child can begin to hope anew. Thisis possible above all for those who know they can trust in a Godwho desires harmony among all people in the peaceful communion ofhis kingdom. It is also possible for those who, though not sharingthe gift of faith, believe in the values of forgiveness andsolidarity and see in them -- not without the hidden action of theSpirit -- the possibility of renewing the face of the earth.   It is therefore to men and women of good will that I addressthis confident appeal. Let us all unite to fight every kind ofviolence and to conquer war! Let us create the conditions whichwill ensure that children can receive as the legacy of ourgeneration a more united and fraternal world!   Let us give children a future of peace!

Also, in his message for the 1994 World Day of Peace (Origins,Vol. 23, pp. 481ff, in the edition dated Dec. 23, 1993), the popediscussed violence and the family. That year's World Day of Peacetheme was "The Family Creates the Peace of the Human Family." Hesaid:   "In order to count on a peaceful future, every child needs toexperience the warmth of caring and constant affection, notbetrayal and exploitation. And although the state can do much byproviding means and structures of support, the contribution of thefamily to ensuring that climate of security and trust cannot bereplaced, so important is it in helping young children to look tothe future with serenity and in preparing them to take aresponsible part in building a society of true progress when theygrow up. Children are the future already present among us; theyneed to experience what peace means so that they will be able tocreate a future of peace."   For a recent text in Origins that is of current interest, see"Walk in the Light," a statement on child sexual abuse, by the U.S.bishops' Committee on Women in Society and in the Church, and theirCommittee on Marriage and Family. It appeared in the current volumeof Origins, pp. 337ff (Nov. 2, 1995). "As a community of Christianswe have the means to shatter the walls of loneliness, shame andfear that isolate those who are sexually abused and those who havesurvived abuse. They need us, and we need to hear their stories ofpain, endurance and courage."   Gun violence against children was discussed in a text by theConnecticut Christian Conference that appeared in the currentvolume of Origins, pp. 17ff (May 25, 1995). The conference is anecumenical group whose members include the Roman CatholicArchdiocese of Hartford and the dioceses of Norwich and Bridgeport.   See also the text titled "Steps Toward Overcoming Violence," byCardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, in Origins, Vol. 24, pp. 793ff (May4, 1995). It focused on street violence against youths.   "The family is the key to the development of positive values,including peacemaking," the U.S. bishops said in their 1994pastoral message titled "Confronting a Culture of Violence: ACatholic Framework for Action" (Origins, Vol. 24, pp. 422ff, theedition dated Dec. 1, 1994).   It said also that "faith challenges each of us to examine howwe can contribute to an ethic which cherishes life, puts peoplebefore things, and values kindness and compassion over anger andvengeance."   "Being a Christian in this society demands that we fight keyelements of our culture of violence," Jesuit Father John Colemansaid in a speech that appeared in the current volume of Origins,pp. 180ff (Aug. 24, 1995). He said: "We harbor violence in ourhearts and perpetrate it in our deeds." Coleman urged people to"pay attention to the attraction and embodiment of violence in ourown speech and actions. Ultimately, nonviolence, as Dorothy Day orGandhi knew, implies a profound conversion of heart and an aversionto the roots of violence in culture, in individualism, racism,vigilantism. They also knew that nonviolence was possible only incommunity."   QUOTE FROM A PAST TEXT OF CURRENT INTEREST:   "Across the globe ... millions of children are dying -- fromstarvation, disease, poverty and military conflict. According toUNICEF, 40,000 children die every day from malnutrition and relateddiseases.   "Wars have killed nearly 2 million children in the last 15years; more than twice that number have been physically disabled;and it is not possible to even estimate the number who have beentraumatized as a result of these conflicts.   "Seven million children are growing up in refugee camps becauseof war and natural disasters; a slightly larger number have beenuprooted from their homes in their own countries....   "Approximately 80 million children work in often monotonous,repetitive and dangerous jobs; in some countries these exploitedchildren earn wages of five to seven cents an hour.   "Fifteen percent of the world's 2 billion children under 15years of age live under what UNICEF terms 'especially difficultcircumstances.' Millions, for example, live in the streets of theexploding Third World cities, resorting to theft, drug trafficking,prostitution and other desperate measures to survive....   "Sickness ravages poor families. Diseases long banished orgenerally unknown in the industrialized world -- measles, malaria,sleeping sickness -- kill hundreds of thousands annually. And nowwe see the worldwide consequences of AIDS, which will produce anestimated 10 million orphans in this decade in Africa alone."   (From "Putting Children and Families First: A Challenge for OurChurch, Nation and World," a November 1991 statement of the U.S.bishops; Origins, Vol. 21, quoted material on  p. 396 in theedition dated Nov. 28, 1991.)Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINS: CATHOLIC DOCUMENTARY SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996THOSE WITH MENTAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES,by Bishop John McCarthy   "Today I call your attention to the special needs of those whoare emotionally disturbed, mentally ill or developmentallydisabled," Bishop John McCarthy of Austin, Texas, said in a letterto the diocese issued at the start of Advent 1995. "Among ourpopulation there are more than 35 million people who suffer fromsome type of mental or emotional disability," he said. "One familyin four has been affected with this burden, and there is no parishin this diocese or anywhere else that does not have parishionerswho carry the burden of mental disabilities or emotional illness."But, McCarthy said, "many people with the problems that I amdiscussing either stay away or are kept away from parish activitiesbecause they know the meaning of rejection. Parishes and parishorganizations should go out of their way to identify these peopleand invite them into our spiritual home." The bishop urged parentsto talk to their children and among themselves "about the complexcauses of mental illness, emotional distress and retardation. Letour children know that within that person who seems different andwhom they might fear or shun there is an extraordinarily uniqueperson loved by God." McCarthy's text follows.   I send you greetings this day as each of our 125 parishes joinswith the rest of the Christian world in beginning the holy seasonof Advent, a period of preparation for the celebration of the birthof the Savior.   In deepening our awareness of God's love for us, we developwithin ourselves a capacity to love others to a greater extent. Itis the human love that responds to our awareness of divine lovethat brings joy and happiness into our lives. It is the lesseningor the absence of love that produces lives that are arid, selfishand unhappy.   Let us seriously consider during this holy season expanding ourhorizons where human love is concerned. Let us reach beyond a lovethat is limited to those closest to us. Let us envelope thosepersons who have a desperate need for love but who frequently donot find it, even among those of us who claim to be followers ofJesus of Nazareth.   Regretfully, our society seems to have an inordinate, perhapsimmature, attachment to youthfulness, beauty and health. These areexcellent qualities, but most of us lack one or the other.Ultimately, all of us will lose all three. The worth of every humanbeing is to be measured not by appearances or mental acumen, butrather by the fact that each of us is an extraordinarily uniquebeing created by God and redeemed by Jesus Christ. Each person isof infinite worth because each of us was created in the image ofGod, "a little less than the angels."   Today I call your attention to the special needs of those whoare emotionally disturbed, mentally ill or developmentallydisabled. Yes, these too are our brothers and sisters. They needunderstanding and love. We, as the followers of Jesus, should bethe first to offer those gifts to them.   While a large segment of our society may look with disdain andfear on persons who are different, the followers of Jesus shoulddo the opposite. Among our population there are more than 35million people who suffer from some type of mental or emotionaldisability. One family in four has been affected with this burden,and there is no parish in this diocese or anywhere else that doesnot have parishioners who carry the burden of mental disabilitiesor emotional illness. Needing understanding, support and love, theyall too frequently experience rejection, isolation and disdain.   While parents are giving thought to preparations for theirchildren's Christmas, let me earnestly suggest that you considergiving them the gifts of sensitivity and generosity. Talk to yourchildren and among yourselves about the complex causes of mentalillness, emotional distress and retardation. Let our children knowthat within that person who seems different and whom they mightfear or shun there is an extraordinarily unique person loved by Godfrom all eternity. While encased for the time being in a humanhabitat that does not function exactly the same way as the rest ofus, the sacredness of that individual is crying out to berecognized. Talk to your children about the importance of going outof their way to be kind to people that others might avoid.Encourage them to invite children who face these problems intotheir games and other activities. Parents who can do this will givetheir children a gift of far greater value than any tricycle,bicycle or other gift that won't last much longer than theChristmas tree. You will be giving them the gift of compassion.   Many people with the problems that I am discussing either stayaway or are kept away from parish activities because they know themeaning of rejection. Parishes and parish organizations should goout of their way to identify these people and invite them into ourspiritual home. One of the great messages of our Lord and SaviorJesus Christ is that he was so at home with those who are different-- the despised tax collector, the poor, the prostitute, the lameand the crippled and the emotionally disturbed. Can we truly claimto be his followers and not attempt to imitate him in this regard?   The holy season of Advent is dominated by the image of John theBaptist. You can say many things about the last of the OldTestament prophets but one thing is certain: He was different!Clothed with hides, living in the desert, dining on locusts,shouting at passersby to straighten out their lives -- I doubt thatJohn was frequently invited to whatever was the equivalent to theRotary Club in that day and time. Yet he was the one that waschosen by God to use to be the first bearer of the good news, todraw the attention of the world to Jesus of Nazareth. Arelatter-day John the Baptists still in our midst? Do we see them?vBack to Headline List CopyrightORIGINS: CATHOLIC DOCUMENTARY SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996*********ONFILE*********   The final report of a three-year archdiocesan planning projectin the Archdiocese of San Francisco was approved Dec. 15 byArchbishop John Quinn, with the concurrence of San Francisco's newcoadjutor, Archbishop William Levada. The plan calls for increasedlay leadership and responsibility, and already has led toestablishment of the School of Pastoral Leadership, which now has1,000 people enrolled. Other priorities in the final report callfor improved liturgies and homilies; strong support for vocationsto priesthood, diaconate and religious life; ongoing religiouseducation and formation for everyone, including stronger Catholicschools and religious education programs, and regular adulteducation; stronger advocacy and witness for the church's socialteachings by the archdiocese's people and institutions; andinvolvement of young adults and youth in service to others.   In terms of archdiocesan structures, the final planning reportincludes recommendations to form an archdiocesan board andarchdiocesan pastoral council to advise the archbishop; establishthe offices of vicar for parishes, vicar for clergy and consecratedlife, and vicar for ethnic and cultural ministries; elevate thearchdiocesan Catholic schools office to the vicar level;restructure communications under a new Office of Communications andPublic Affairs; establish the office of a director of humanresources.   Quinn began an archdiocese-wide consultation in early 1993 toprepare the local church for the next millennium. Among factorsbehind the planning was a new San Francisco ordinance requiringthat all public buildings built with unreinforced masonry --including a number of the city's older Catholic churches -- bereinforced to meet earthquake safety standards. Decisions madeearlier in the planning process called for the closing of somechurches but also for keeping several open that didn't meet the newbuilding standards. In August 1995 the archdiocese announced $6million in grants to help five parishes be retrofitted to meet theearthquake safety standards.   Quinn announced last summer that he planned to retire in thefirst part of 1996 and that he had a spring-term fellowship atOxford University in England and an appointment as centenniallecturer at Oxford's Campion Hall. He said one reason he asked fora coadjutor archbishop was to involve his successor in thearchdiocese's final planning stage.   Auxiliary Bishop John Dunne of Rockville Centre, N.Y., newchairman of the U.S. bishops' Committee on Women in Society and inthe Church, has named six bishops to serve on the committee. TheU.S. Catholic Conference announced that the committee also expectsto appoint women advisers after its first meeting, in March. Dunnewas elected head of the committee at the U.S. bishops' Novembermeeting in Washington. The new committee members are BishopsRichard Hanifen of Colorado Springs, Colo., Howard Hubbard ofAlbany, N.Y., and Joseph Gossman of Raleigh, N.C.; and AuxiliaryBishops Gabino Zavala of Los Angeles, George Murry of Chicago andWilliam Newman of Baltimore. Among future committee projects areongoing studies of feminism and the ways women may exerciseleadership in the church, along with the publication of Pope JohnPaul II's 1995 statements to and about women.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINS: CATHOLIC DOCUMENTARY SERVICE via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996*********DATEBOOK*********   Jan. 17-20: Southwest Liturgical Conference Annual Study Week.Theme: "What Is This Place?

asdicyclopentadiene, DCPD), piperylene (trans- and cis-1,3- pentadiene)and 2-methyl-butene-2 (2MB2).In 1994, combined consumption of these distillates was more than 1 Mtonnes, and this is expected to rise by an average 4.3%/y to more than1.5 M tonne/y by 2005.Isoprene rubber is the major end-use for isoprene, global demand forwhich was 566,000 tonnes in 1995.Styrene-isoprene block copolymers (SBCs) offer the greatest potentialincrease in demand for isoprene, and by 2005, this could reach 840,000tonne/y. 10% of isoprene demand is for production of butyl rubber andthis could increase if natural rubber becomes in short supply.In 1995, demand for DCPD totalled 271,000 tonne/y, of which 50% wasused for production of hydrocarbon resins. 19% was used for productionof unsaturated polyester resins, and 11% for ethylidene norborneneproduction.To 2005, demand for high-purity DCPD for production of cyclic olefincopolymers is expected to rise.If production of this and other new DCPD derivatives increases, globaldemand for DCPD could be more than 460,000 tonne/y by 2005.In 1995, piperylene consumption was 134,000 tonnes worldwide, with anincrease to 180,000 tonne/y forecast to 2005.For 2MB2, demand is forecast to rise from 34,000 tonne/y in 1995 to41,000 tonne/y in 2005.In 1995, the effective capacity for isoprene production worldwide was983,000 tonne/y, with that for DCPD at 322,000 tonne/y and forpiperylene at 147,000 tonne/y. 49% of the world production of isopreneis from the former Soviet Union.The major DCPD producers and consumers are Japan and the US.Pie charts

Focus on Biopesticides PLUS, Oct 1996, Pg. 1-2Following the discovery and marketing of the first microbialherbicides, Collego and Devine, in the USA in the early 1980s, therewas a massive upsurge of research in this area.By 1989 more than 100 fungal pathogens were being studied as potentialmicrobial herbicides for control of 69 weed species.Of these, 19 were considered to have good practical potential.However, those products on the market in the USA were withdrawn forcommercial reasons (though Devine is now available again) and thosethought to be close to market have disappeared.Many reasaons have been offered to explain the failure to translategood microbial herbicide potential identified in laboratory experimentsto practical success in the field.One possible reason for the failure to make biological weed controlagents work in the field is that virtually all the laboratory trialsuse some form of atomiser to apply suspensions of infective propagulesto the target weed.The spray is applied at an application volume of 1000-3000 l/ha.Field experiments apply at not more than 500-600 l/ha in a spraydroplet spectrum consisting of droplet sizes ranging from just a fewmicrons to more than 500 microns in diameter.Inevitably, there will be a reduction in the inoculum retained on thetarget and changes in its distribution.It is no surprise that field applications have been unreliable andcommercial development constrained.The answer is that research teams should include expertise informulation and spray applications as well as weed and pathogen biology.Copyright 1996

in research and development will total #174 M in 1996,representing 11% of turnover.AgrEvo's research and development budget is expected to increaserapidly because of investment in biotechnology.About 6% of research expenditure was destined for biotechnology beforethe company acquired the Dutch/Belgian biotechnology company, PlantGenetic Systems International.During 1996-2001 this investment is expected to increase to 25%.By 2005 AgrEvo expects that plant and biotechnology products andtechniques will generate additional sales in excess of DM 1 bn/y.Principal contributions to revenue will arise from sales of LibertyLink varieties of oilseed rape. maize, sugar beet, cotton, and soyabeans which are resistant to glufosinate-ammonium.Efficiency improving measures should reduce AgrEvo's costs by #130 Mbefore 1999.Since AgrEvo was established on 1 Jan 1994 its number of employees hasbeen reduced by about 1300, research and marketing operationscentralised, and the number of production

amarket of about 500,000 tonnes/y.How long this will take is not certain.The major advantage of TPEs is their recyclability, though theseparation of parts is still a major hurdle for many components.The European market for thermoplastic vulcanisates is currently20,000-24,000 tonnes/y, and this would be greatly increased if TPVswere used in automotive weatherstripping.Each vehicle has an average of 12kg of rubber weatherstripping, addingup to a market of over 150,000 tonnes/y in Europe and 441,000 tonnes/yworldwide.However, the switch away from EPDM would involve major machinery costsfor rubber processors.A second advantage of TPEs over EPDM is better tear resistance.EPDM seals are failing under warranty and causing problems for carmanufacturers.General Motors is reported to be replacing EPDM trim with alternativematerials within the next 5 years.Japanese car makers are pioneering the use of new materials.Foamed grades of TPEs will be very important.Copyright 1996 Royal

face a supply crisisfor processing chemicals in the next 2-3 years unless prices for thechemicals recover to reasonable levels.Prices are only 60-70% of the level of the late 1980s, and it isquestionable whether re-investment can be justified.Yet up to 200,000 tonnes of new capacity will be needed worldwidewithin the next 10 years, equivalent to one new plant each year.The total necessary investment is around $667 M.These figures are based on 3%/y demand growth and the need to phase outolder, uneconomic plants.If supplies become short, prices would fluctuate wildly, which would bebad for both suppliers and customers.Bayer says it is not prepared to shoulder supply responsibilitiesalone, although it is in the strongest position to weather the crisisbecause its rubber business is back-integrated into rubber chemicals.It is currently looking for rubber chemical production partners inIndia and China, and is prepared to spend over $200 M on theseprojects.Bayer says the pricing problem is not just about allowing newinvestment, but about producers staying in the industry at all.Copyright 1996 Royal Society of ChemistryBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL

German company which is lesscommitted to phasing out PVC.Although the company has recently launched a new range of PVC-freeflooring, factory managers admit that they have no concrete plans tophase out PVC.They are, instead, actively expanding their PVC products into SouthAfrica, eastern Europe and the Middle East, where PVC disposal methodsare lax.In Sweden, Tarkett sells 60% of all PVC floors.As the single largest user of PVC, it is also the biggest DEHPpolluter.It is estimated that there is a leaching of DEHP from PVC floors intothe environment of 30-60 tonne/y.DEHP has been identified as a hormone disruptor which can affect thehealth and development of infants at extremely low levels.In Aug 1996, a fire at the municipal dump in Ronneby, Sweden (where theTarkett plant is located) broke out when hot PVC waste was dumped fromthe plant.Greenpeace demanded dioxin tests and widespread publicity ensued.In addition to carrying out direct actions at the plant, Greenpeace hasalso filed a case against Tarkett for breaking the rule ofsubstitution.The suit is based on a Swedish law which states that anyone using ahazardous substance has to substitute this with a less hazardoussubstance if there is one on the market.Greenpeace is demanding a PVC phaseout plan from Tarkett and iscontacting outlets which sell Tarkett floorings asking them to sellalternative PVC flooring.Copyright 1996

ofhexamethylenetetramine (hexamine) because it was unprofitable.This resulted in lower domestic production.Increased domestic demand for hexamine in Taiwan and China has resultedin lower exports of the material to Japan.Thus supplies of hexamine in Japan have tightened.The primary application for hexamine is in phenol resins as a hardenerand in resins for shell moulding.The Japanese market is estimated at 12,000 tonne/y and is not expectedto grow.However, demand elsewhere in Asia is increasing in line with thegrowing production there of household electrical appliances andautomobiles.No capacity expansions are expected by the two remaining producers,Nippon Kasei Chemical Co and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, which are alsofinding production unprofitable.They both have capacities of around

1996Ref: The Independent, 5 Nov 1996, Pg. 19British Biotech's shares slumped 9% yesterday despite test resultswhich the company claimed provided further confirmation of theeffectiveness of its Marimastat anti-cancer treatment.The company, whose shares soared a year ago on hopes for Marimastat,said the phase two trials involving 381 cancer sufferers were the mostwide-ranging yet and gave further evidence of the drug's ability torestrain the disease across a wide range of cancers.But it was rewarded with a 21.5p slump in the share price to 207.5pyesterday.James Noble, finance director said: "It is rather odd that the shareshave gone down, because these are by far the most important results wehave reported as a company."He ascribed the reaction to the fact that data was "just very, verycomplicated".Many analysts, however, downplayed the significance of the results,which for the first time included information on trials with patientswith gastric and colorectal cancers.One analyst said: "Our broad thinking is that the information dosen'treally add substantially to what we already know."Questions remained about the dosage regime and the side-effects of thedrug, which causes pains in the arm and shoulder when used over aprolonged period.The data was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncologymeeting in Vienna, which brings together cancer specialists from allaround Europe.British Biotech said the tests confirmed earlier results that showedhigher dosage rates of 10mg, 25mg and 50mg twice a day were moreeffective than lower ones.The group claimed that the outcomes confirmed there was a connectionbetween a reduction in antigens, used as a marker to monitor theprogression of cancer, and a reduction in the disease."It is absolutely proved that we can reduce the antigens in a group of381 patients and where we reduce the antigens people live longer," MrNoble said, "We obviously think it is the drug's effect, but we can'tprove it as yet."The results in 14 patients suffering from gastric cancers showed halfappearing to respond or showing no further progression of the disease.Despite microscopic evidence that Marimastat was coating tumours in afibre, as predicted, analysts said the sample size was too small to besignificant.Other studies in colorectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancers had shownsimilar results, Mr Noble said.Phase three trials under way on Marimastat remains the key to thedrug's final approval and launch onto the market, which is unlikelybefore 1999 or 2000, analysts say.A treatment for pancreatic cancer is likely to be first to market, butexternal sales forecasts vary widely from $100 M in the first year to$1 bn.Later this month, the group will give phase three test data for itsLexipaphant treatment.(Full

Lords threw out an appeal by Biogen attempting to overturnan earlier ruling by the Court of Appeal that Medeva's drug, Hepagene,did not infringe its patent over a similar treatment.Alexandra Hockenhull, a Medeva spokeswoman, said: "The outcome sends avery strong signal.We had felt extremely confident all along.We had a decisive victory in the appeal court and now, with anotherdecisive victory in the House of Lords, we feel even more confident.The group still faces a separate patent infringement action overHepagene filed in 1993 by Pasteur-Merieux, a French drugs group.However, it had not proceeded "expeditiously" with the claim, she said,and a trial date had not yet been requested or set.The drug, which is still under development, was acquired for a littleover $3 M by Medeva in 1992 from a group of Swiss and German scientistsknown as Epitec.Biogen, whose own Hepatitis B vaccine is licensed to SmithKline Beechamand Merck, won an initial action against Medeva in the High Court in1993.But the House of Lords ruled yesterday that Biogen's patent was invalidin the UK.Medeva said it hoped to announce the results of phase three trials ofHepagene as a vaccine in Jan 1997, with phase 2 proof of principaltests on its effectiveness as a treatment due by the end of the year.Estimates suggest that around 30 M people in the world carrying theHepatitis B virus are highly infectious.Biogen's chief executive, Jim Vincent, said: "Although we expect tocontinue receiving our UK royalties of less than a million dollarsannually based on the surviving Hepatitis B patent, we

TRI (ToxicsRelease Inventory) legislation.MA passed its Toxics Use Reduction Act in 1989 requiring companies overa certain size to halve toxic wastes over 10 years, prepare a materialsbalance audit and present a flow diagram showing the fate of theirtoxic materials.A report needs to be filed every other year.The companies are given technical assistance to comply through thegoverning

an opportunity toenter the market for generic bulk clavulanic acid.The production of potassium clavulanate is a natural extension of thecompany's core activities.It is produced by large-scale fermentation.Clavulanic acid is at present marketed by SmithKline Beecham who holdpatents on it, and recently a few generic suppliers have also enteredthe market.Several patents have expired or will soon.In the very near future, patents related to the therapeutic use ofclavulanic acid in combination with beta-lactams like amoxicillin willbe expiring as well, or have already expired.In Jul 1996 the European Patent Office granted a patent on a process topurify clavulanic acid.The development of additional cost-effective processes is in the phaseof completion and patent applications will be submitted soon.The European Pharmacopoeia Commission has granted a Certificate ofSuitability (CoS) for potassium clavulanate produced in theNetherlands.It will soon be followed by a CoS for the

Some linkages have been between twoenvironmental service firms. Others, such as Fluor's merger withGroundwater Technology, allied an environmental remediation specialist with$178 million in 1995 revenues, with an expert in engineering andconstruction whose revenues last year topped $8.5 billion. Dow Radian(Austin, Tex.), Dow's merger with Radian, similarly, combined two companieswith different areas of expertise. The company expects some $400 millionin bookings this year.   Other acquisitions and mergers colored the U.S environmental servicesmarket last year. OHM Inc. (Findley, Ohio), for example, expanded itshazardous-waste remediation business by acquiring the hazwaste and radwastedivisions of Rust International, a subsidiary of WMX Technologies (OakBrook, Ill.). As part of the deal, WMX will own part of OHM.In addition:-- Geraghty & Miller (Plainview, N.Y.) bought Piedmont Olsen Hensley, aGreenville, S.C., E&C firm.-- Earth Tech (Long Beach, Calif.) bought Barett Consulting Group (MenloPark, Calif.), a water and infrastructure firm.-- Roy F. Weston (West Chester, Pa.) formed a partnership with The EiconGroup, a bioremediation firm in New Haven, Conn.-- Tetra Tech, Inc. (Pasadena, Calif.) bought PRC Environmental Management(Alexandria, Va.).-- Allwaste (Houston) bought Ecova Corp.'s In-Plant Service business.-- Thermo Remediation Inc. (Waltham, Mass.) plans to buy RemediationTechnologies, Inc. (Concord, Mass.) for $33.3 million. Thermo ProcessSystems bought Lancaster Laboratories (Lancaster, Pa.) for about $25million. rEven though their revenues set records last year, environmental equipmentand services companies know that the days of double digit U.S. marketgrowth are over. For one thing, their business has matured, and, as CPIplants better control and reduce their emissions, there is a less urgentneed for their products.   In addition, customers' demands are becoming more sophisticated. Instead of asking for simple environmental project management, downsizedgovernment agencies and companies now want a full array of consultingresources to help them stay competitive. ``Our clients want help managingthe whole problem, not just effluents at the end of the pipe,'' says EllenLeinfuss, vice-president for marketing for Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.(Branchburg, N.J.), which is moving into an integrated environmental andresource-management position.    In response, more companies in the environmental sector are linking upwith each other, or with engineering and construction firms, to meetchanging needs in a future that still looks unclear (Box, p. 39). The trendto ``one stop'' consulting is evidenced by last quarter's merger betweenRadian Corp. (Austin, Tex.) and Dow Chemical Co. (Midland, Mich.),combining process design and remediation knowhow. Similarly, last month'smerger between Fluor Daniel, Inc. (Irvine, Calif.) and GroundwaterTechnology, Inc. (GTI; Norwood, Mass.) united engineering and constructionwith remediation expertise. As Walter Barber, president of the newcompany, Fluor Daniel/GTI, explains, the merger came mainly in response tothe changing needs of the U.S. Dept. of Defense (Washington, D.C.), a majorforce in the soil remediation market. ``They want to deal with engineeringcompanies much larger than most environmental firms.''Market growth slowsNo doubt, slowing market growth is also helping to shape environmentalequipment and service companies' strategies. As more of their businesssegments top out, conditions will soon become cutthroat if the currenttrends continue. Take the flat, but sizeable, $9-billion market for soiland groundwater remediation. If demand dips to $8 billion, says Barber,``We'll see a real identification of winners and losers.''   Clearly, U.S. demand for environmental products and services sector hasbeen increasing, but, since 1993, its growth has been slowing, and it hasbeen shrinking as a percentage of capital spending. In its 1995 membersurvey, the U.S. Chemical Manufacturers Assn. (CMA; Washington, D.C.) foundthat, while overall capital spending increased by 25% between 1993 and1996, spending on the environment dropped from 16.8% of all capitalspending in 1993 to 13.3% last year. In 1996, members expect it to drop to10% of spending.   Some analysts see the U.S. environmental market doing only about onepercentage point better than the overall economy. Between 1993 and 1998,growth should stand at 3.9%/yr, with overall revenues moving from $133.5 to$162.1 billion (Table, p. 39), according to Environmental BusinessInternational (EBI; San Diego, Calif.).   One standout among types of pollution spending has been air pollutioncontrol, although EBI notes that growth has been slowing and revenuesdeclining since 1993. Last year, the analysts say, the market totalled $12billion, as opposed to $13.5 billion for water pollution control equipmentand chemicals. Between 1993 and 1994, demand grew by 1.7%, and it shouldcontinue at 2% until 1998.   In the air-pollution-control equipment segment, volatile organiccompound (VOC) recovery systems, particularly regenerative thermaloxidizers, have been a stellar product, according to Bob McIlvaine,president of The McIlvaine Co. (Northbrook, Ill.). Demand for the units,which burn flammable VOCs, sometimes with the use of supplemental naturalgas, has gone from $8 million to over $350 million.Exports: uncharted territoryAn unexplored market for many U.S. companies is exports, according to EBI. ``The very size of the U.S. market has bred complacency and anunwillingness to expand beyond U.S. borders,'' notes EBI president, GrantFerrier. In addition, management of water, sewage, and other municipalworks has not been privatized in the U.S. Other factors, he says, are lackof sufficient market intelligence and government support, although thepicture is starting to change (p. 46).   A closer look at the numbers shows that hazardous waste management andwaste management equipment will shrink during the five-year period. Thestand-out growth prospect is ``process and prevention technology,''expected to leap by 15% -- but from $800 million, the smallest base of anyof the categories analyzed.   Combined, resource recovery -- primarily municipal waste incineration --and environmental energy sources, including biomass and other alternativeenergy sources, will grow from just over $17 billion to $23 billion in1998. While this growth is respectable, it wasn't so long ago thatforecasts called for municipal waste incineration to reach the $100-billionmark by the year 2000.   Meanwhile, the hazardous waste disposal sector is bearing the brunt ofpollution prevention efforts, with disposed volumes having declined now forseveral years. ``There are fewer regulatory drivers to waste disposal thatfueled the industry growth in the 1980s, and the tremendous emphasis onwaste reduction has impacted our landfill and incineration facilities,''says Kevin Igli, vice president for environmental management at ChemicalWaste Management, a subisidiary of WMX Technologies, Inc. (Oak Brook,Ill.).   But, reflecting the current trend, CWM, too, is getting into the wastereduction business, he says. ``Previously, we simply picked up the waste atthe plant gate; now, we're going into the plant to help companies developwaste- reduction schemes.''   Igli also sees a potentially dramatic change looming in proposed rulesfrom EPA concerning waste definitions and delisting. A new Hazardous WasteIdentification Rule (HWIR) has been issued that combines risk analysis withchemical analysis of waste streams, along with a strategy for treatment.``Waste generators will be in a position of trying to decide whether theywant to handle qualified materials as industrial, rather than hazardous,waste streams, and deciding what level of treatment they want.''   If more wastes get delisted, and sent to regular landfills rather thansecured hazwaste fills, the business could take another hit. But the samecompanies might be expanding their waste-treatment operations, or theiranalytical and consulting work.Regulatory uncertainty's a factorLooming in the background is the antiregulatory climate in Washington thathas been intensifying since Republicans gained control of Congress in late1994. While there shouldn't be a dramatic drop in environmental spending,and most observers say companies will still have to meet existing ortougher standards, Congress has been sending clear signals that it wantsregulators off industry's back, and chemical manufacturing companies aren'tcomplaining. ``Our members continue to find that you get back only about 10cents on the dollar invested in environmental activity,'' notes Alan Lenz,chief economist for the U.S. Chemical Manufacturing Assn. (CMA; Washington,D.C.). And this, he says, takes into account lower disposal costs,recovered byproducts and other benefits.   Instead of celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary, the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, Washington, D.C.) spent a good partof last year worrying about its survival. Only a veto by PresidentClinton in December saved its enforcement budget from a 21% funding cutthat, according to assistant EPA administrator Fred Hanson, would have leftit ``unable to ensure continued protection of the environment.''   At a time when Clean Air Act amendments call for hiring new enforcementpersonnel, EPA has had to cut staff. ``We have to do more with less, butthe solution is to work smarter [and not simply cut funding],'' Hanson toldCE at a press conference at the Environmental Champions awards (CE,November, p. 54) presentation in New York last month.   Overshadowing Congressional debate has been some nasty confrontationover the budget, and the drive for a balanced budget by 2002. One way thatRepublican legislators have made their views known is by sponsoring riderson budget bills or other unrelated legislation. So far, they have proposedsuch measures as stopping EPA review of Army Corps of Engineers' wetlandspermitting, preventing expansion of the Toxics Release Inventory, anddelaying application of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT)air-emission standards for petroleum refiners. These and other riderscontinuously appeared during the summer and fall despite a House vote toomit riders from agency appropriations. However, this year, MACT standardsare expected to be issued for air emissions from refineries.   Another potential blow to environmental enforcement was the passage lastyear of the Unfunded Mandates bill. By blocking enforcement programs whosefunding has not already been assured by individual state budgets, the billcould have a significant impact on a number of environmental regulations.Legislation in limboAt the same time, key pieces of legislation remain suspended in Congress,and it is still too soon to tell whether Superfund, the Safe Drinking WaterAct, the Clean Water Act, or Regulatory Reform will pass next year. TheClean Water Act (CWA) reauthorization bill (H.R. 961) passed the House lastspring, but is hung up in the Senate as debate continues over non-pointpollution sources, and whether the agricultural sector should be included.Eventually, CWA could become primarily an enforcement program.   For Superfund, the big sticking point is retroactive liability, whilethe Safe Drinking Water Act, once bolstered by bipartisan support, has alsorun into objections. A Senate reauthorization bill has been called ``onelarge, unfunded mandate'' by critics, who expect it to double or triple thecosts of water systems nationally. Although the bill has been passed bythe House, it remains stalled in the Senate.   The Takings Bill, which would have the government pay landowners whoseproperty is devalued because of regulations, was approved by the House andhas passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Endangered Species Actreauthorization, which would cut protective regulation, has been passed bythe House, but has not yet been acted upon by the Senate.   Industry representatives and conservative policymakers who supportRepublican-sponsored environmental regulatory reform say that their goalsare to rationalize environmental policies in an age of limited publicresources. ``We seek to streamline the process, to make it less oppressiveand wasteful,'' says Charles DiBona, president of the American PetroleumInstitute (Washington, D.C.), in a speech at the association's annualmeeting last November.   Clinton Administration officials use similar reformatory terms indescribing their goals, but draw a line at EPA funding. ``Congressionalproposals to slash EPA budgets are absolutely unacceptable,'' says ElaineKamarck, senior policy advisor to Vice President Al Gore. The key toeffective policy, she adds, is making enforcement more selective byidentifying problem generators, and emphasizing compliance, rather than``ticket-writing.''   Many in the environmental business are calling for more-rationalenvironmental planning, grounded in economic reality. ``There [are morethan enough] laws on the books for protecting the environment,'' says FluorDaniel/GTI's president Barber. ``Over the next five years, we should shiftaway from regulatory, and toward economic, drivers.''   The current regulatory climate could help foster useful activities, hesays. Among examples he cites are recovering value by reclaimingchemicals, either from waste streams or as part of pollution-preventionprograms, using remediated sites, or ``brownfields'' for industrialpurposes, rather than restoring them to pristine conditions, and reducingliability for insurance purposes.   Environmentalists, meanwhile, are gravely concerned about the falloutfrom the Republican agenda. ``[Reform is] a blatant repeal of environmentalprotections that would provide many opportunities for legal challenges, andwould tie regulations up in bureaucratic red tape,'' says John Kostayack,an attorney with the National Wildlife Federation (Washington, D.C.).Consensus on risk assessment?One area where some consensus is shaping up is in risk assessment andmanagement. EPA itself has several programs in the works to allow forgreater use of risk assessment in making priority choices in pollutioncontrol, and in evaluating hazards.   A risk assessment provision that would call for detailed risk versusbenefit analysis before any environmental regulation is issued, passed theHouse last February as part of a regulatory reform bill (H.R. 1022). TheSenate version (S.343) has since been bottled up in committee.Nevertheless, the House bill offers a sound scientific way to calculatepotential risk from chemicals, says Dr. George Gray, deputy director of theHarvard University School of Public Health's Center for Risk Analysis(Cambridge, Mass.). ``We need to get away from a single number [forcalculating risk] and consider the range of potential effects.'' EPA'sreliance on worst-case scenarios and linear dose-responses tars manychemicals with the same brush, he says, and does nothing to allay publicfears about risk.   Of course, it remains to be seen whether risk assessment and other keyelements of Republican reform actually wind up changing any environmentalregulations. U.S. environmental firms are not waiting to find out, though,as they prepare to face a very different business in the future.

Sound futuristic? It'salready happening, as more chemical engineers tap into molecular modelingand combinatorial chemistry techniques (Box, p. 33) to speed up productdesign and to avoid the costly trial and error of physical tests.   Molecular modeling was once the exclusive domain of chemists, who applythe concept on the microscopic, structural level. Now, chemical engineersare modeling on the macroscopic level, examining chemical groups ratherthan elements, explains Rafiqul Ghani, head of the University of Denmark's(Lyngby) Computer Aided Molecular Design program. The results are alreadyshowing up in better products, environmentally benign processes, andimproved equipment, at a fraction of the typical product development cost.   This new market, in turn, is driving the development of moreuser-friendly modeling packages, incorporating expert systems and extensivedatabases. It has also played some part in the merger between Californiabased Biosym Technologies and Molecular Simulations, Inc. (MSI; Medford,Mass.) last August. The new company, Biosym/MSI, Inc. (San Diego), isstrengthening its push outside the pharmaceutical market into new materialsdevelopment.   Reverse engineering or ``retrosynthesis'' (CE, July, 1995, p. 33) is thebasis of molecular modeling, which starts with the concept for a newproduct, then works backward to develop a way to make it.``Computationally, this becomes very intensive,'' says Jeremy Winter,manager of Courtaulds plc's (Coventry, U.K.) theory and modeling group,which is applying the concept to design polymers for synthetic fibers.   For complex molecules, which can require gigabytes of data storagespace, supercomputers are still needed, but they're no longer aprerequisite for modeling. New packages running on workstations and evenPCs are taking modeling far beyond the laboratory.   Illustrating the trend are two PC-based packages that will be introducedcommercially this month: Cranium (diagram, p. 31), which features abuilt-in database and expert system to calculate physical properties, isoffered by Molecular Knowledge Systems (MKS; Nashua, N.H.), whileBatchDesign-Kit, a proces synthesis program for pharmaceuticals andspecialty chemicals, is offered by Gensym Corp. (Cambridge, Mass). Builtonto Gensym's G2 expert system, it allows users to optimize theenvironmental performance of their processes as they do simulations anddevelop flow and recipe sheets.Environmental modelingSuch products are sure of a market, as more companies in the chemicalprocess industries (CPI) turn to molecular modeling to cut developmentcosts and time. Environmental pressures have driven many of their projects.DuPont Co. (Wilmington, Del.), for example, used software from Gaussian,Inc. (Pittsburgh, Pa.) and other programs to come up with routes tochlorofluorocarbon (CFC) substitutes.   Far from research oddities, the results include such molecules asHFC-134a, which is now in commercial production at several plants. Modelinga typical set of thermodynamic calculations took under a week and costunder $5,000, less than one tenth the cost of physical experiments, saysDavid Dixon, former research leader in computational chemistry at DuPont. He is now associate director for theory, modeling and simulation atBattelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (Richland, Wash.), whichis modeling cleanup methods for mixed wastes containing radioactive andchlorinated organic compounds.   Others have used modelling to design the right catalyst for their needs.  Catalytica, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), for example, used softwaredeveloped by Biosym/MSI to design a catalyst to eliminate unwantedbyproduct.   Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Allentown, Pa.), which has usedmolecular modeling to screen fluorinating reagents, is modeling catalyststhat will allow it to make polyethylene foam without freon. Where itusually takes weeks to test a new chemical, modeling takes only minutes andminimizes lab work, says Air Products engineering associate, Paul Mathias.Modeling and equipment designEquipment design is also poised to benefit from increased use of molecularmodeling. At Dow Chemical Co. (Midland, Mich.), chemists and chemicalengineers are using Gaussian's program to calculate heats of formation andreaction of materials, to aid in reactor and heat exchanger design.Meanwhile, Engineered Software Inc. (ESI; Lacey, Wash.) has just finishedbeta testing Cranium to size piping and pumps for mixed fluids. MKS willnow offer the software to ESI's customers. ``Cranium makes processsimulation data available to plant designers and operators,'' says ESIpresident Ray Hardee, ``and not just process simulation specialists.''   In chemical product development, Union Carbide Corp.'s ThermophysicalProperties Skill Center (Charleston, W.Vs.) is using MKS's Synapsemolecular design program to measure vapor-liquid and other phaseequilibria, mainly to select solvents for liquid-liquid extraction orazeotropic distillation. Shell Development Co. (Houston) is using Biosym'sInsight and Discover to develop new products, including a solvent tailoredto a new plastics recycling process.   There are still some kinks to work out with molecular modelingtechnology. One complaint is that the programs are time consuming. Anotheris that most of today's models work best with small molecules. ``It shouldtake at least another three years before programs can routinely modelcomplex polymer processing systems,'' says Chan Chyun Chen, AspenTech'sbusiness manager for polymer process modeling. In process simulation, datafrom molecular modeling aren't quite ready for routine use, says SuphatWatanasiri, product manager for physical properties at Aspen Technology,Inc. (AspenTech; Cambridge, Mass.).   But ``the pieces are starting to come together,'' says MKS president KenJoback, who designed both Cranium and Synapse packages. Operating companieshave been combining commercial programs with others they've developedinhouse. DuPont researchers, for example, began their quest for theultimate CFC substitute by using, among others, Gaussian's program, whichapplies quantum mechanical methods to electronic structure problems. Todesign the right molecule, they fed into the computer ideal physicalproperties and data on unwanted elements, such as chlorine.   Once they had a basic molecular geometry, they then calculated themolecules' vibrational frequencies and, using a Cray supercomputer and thecompany's own atmospheric modeling codes, the molecules' potentialcontribution to global warming. At this point, data could be fed into acommercial process simulation program.   Dow is also mixing and matching its own and vendors' programs, both forits heat data project, and to build databases of energies for reactiveintermediates. So far, its efforts have achieved results that would bedifficult or impossible to do experimentally, says Nelson Rondan, technicalleader in the company's Computing and Information Technology Lab.Inhouse and vendor softwareFirst, Dow researchers use Biosym's Insight program to design molecules. They then turn to Synthia, a pogram developed inhouse and then licensed toBiosym, to predict mechanical and other properties, such as solubility andglass transition temperature, for polymer structures. At that point,Gaussian's program is used for more- detailed analysis.   Shell Development Co., meanwhile, is augmenting its use of commercialmodeling software with its own statistical thermodynamic model. Based onequations of state, the model can calculate phase behavior or solubility.The company is now looking for a partner to help it develop the program.   Generally, molecular modeling programs are either derived fromexperimental data, or from theoretical principles. Leading in thedevelopment of empirically derived models is the University of Denmark'sLyngby research group, whose Computer Aided Molecular Design package isbased on the theory of ``group contribution*'' (CE, November 1994, p. 82).In simple terms, using this theory requires developing a database in whichmolecules are divided into groups of related atoms and assigned values,based on existing data. The data then allow properties to be predicted.First used to predict activity coefficients, the technique has since beenextended to predict isomeric properties and solubility, and to developcorrelations between predictable properties and toxicity.   The goal is not to present a single solution but rather to narrow thesearch to a number of promising alternatives that can be evaluated further,says Lyngby group research director, Gani. ``In some cases it's led tosolutions that companies would never have otherwise found.'' UnionCarbide, DuPont, Toyo Engineering, Simulation Sciences and Hyprotech areamong 23 companies now working with the group.   Now, more programs are combining elements of both empirically andtheoretically derived models. Dow's Synthia, for example, uses empiricalcorrelation techniques, but bases predictions strictly on local polymerstructure, focusing on polymer chain segments.   Other examples of programs using both techniques include Biosym's QSPR(Quantitative Structure Property Relationahip) and MKS's Synapse, both ofwhich run on Silicon Graphics workstations. With Synapse, users specifyconstraints on physical properties such as vapor pressure, flash point orviscosity. The program then generates the molecular structures ofchemicals that satisfy those constraints. Cranium can then be used tocalculate the physical properties data needed to make a product, such asactivity coefficients, enthalpy of formation, Gibbs energy, density andthermal conductivity.Consortia spread the wordTo develop the technology in pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical markets,vendors and developers of modeling software are stepping up their effortsto reach potential end users. The Lyngby Computer Aided Molecular Designgroup offers companies membership in consortia for $7,500/yr.   Biosym has also formed consortia with industries that have commonproblems, a practice that Biosym/MSI is continuing. Participants typicallymake a three-year commitment and invest up to $250,000. So far, consortiaare in place to study catalysis and adsorption, as well as polymerstructures, properties and behavior.   A consortium of private pharmaceutical and chemical companies funded development of BatchDesign-Kit by Massachusetts Institute of Technologyprofessor George Stephanopoulos. Pollution prevention was a key part of theprogram, which is why EPA and the National Science Foundation helped withfunding, while New Jersey Institute of Technology's (NJIT; Newark) EmissionReduction Research Center provided some technical input.   Clearly, molecular modeling's marketplace is expanding beyond itstraditional R&D base. Gaussian's program, for example, which costs about$20,000 per site license, and requires a supercomputer for someapplications, is finding more CPI customers. Proponents are optimisticabout modeling's future in engineering. Says MKS's Joback, ``In less thanten years, the [software] pieces will be in place to take a new chemicalproduct all the way from initial concept to a three-dimensional plantlayout.''Illustration(s):Illustration: Catalyst development is only one area where the CPI have beenrelying on molecular modelling.

It allowsresearchers to make and test many compounds simultaneously, speeding up thediscovery process. The technology has been under development for about fiveyears, but only in the last few years have the CPI started to use it.   Interest is clearly growing. Recently, for example: Parke-DavisPharmaceutical Research Div. of Warner-Lambert Co. (Ann Arbor, Mich.) hasspun off its Diversomer organic synthesis technology as a commercialventure; ArQule Inc. (Medford, Mass.) has set up a joint developmentventure for pharmaceuticals with Solvay Duphar B.V. (Brussels, Belgium)using ArQule's combinatorial chemistry techniques; and a new company hasbeen formed to commercialize a combinatorial synthesis method for newmaterials, developed at Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley NationalLaboratory in California.   Combinatorial chemistry arose out of the need to speed up the discoveryprocess, notes Sheila DeWitt, an inventor of the Parke-Davis process andnow vice-president, technical development for the spin-off company,Diversomer Technologies Inc. Computational chemistry is good for an initialscreening, she says, ``but it didn't live up to the expectation of beingable to use it for to design an active drug directly.You still have to do alot of syntheses and tests.''   At ArQule, up to 4,000 compounds/d can be synthesized by the company'sAutomated Molecular Assembly Plant (AMAP; diagram, above), compared withtwo or three a week by a researcher using traditional methods. AMAPconsists of tiny, glass-lined reactors, ranging in size from one to 10milliliters. They are arranged in modules up to about 1 ft2, which can beheated or cooled as necessary. Compounds are produced from multiplecombinations of reagents by dissolving the reagents in solvents and feedingdifferent combinations to each minireactor.   The solvents may be removed by various methods, such as evaporation, orby binding the reagent on beads, then removing the solvent. ``We need to beflexible,'' says David Boulton, senior director for automated chemicalsynthesis.   The entire process is computer-controlled, with robotic arms feeding thereactors and removing samples for analysis. ``We run it like a plant,''says Boulton. ``Most of the operators are chemical engineers, and we haveprocess and analytical chemists, mechanical engineers, and systemsengineers to handle the networking.'' He adds that the facility can also beused for process development.   ArQule does R&D at the facility in collaboration with partners, such asthe arrangement with Solvay. Although pharmaceuticals are the main area ofinterest at present, the technology could be applied to virtually anychemistry, says Boulton. ArQule also has an agreement with Pharmacia LKB(Uppsala, Sweden) to develop new affinity ligands for biotechnologyapplications in liquid chromatography, and is working on a process forcatalyst development.   Diversomer Technologies is offering the Parke-Davis system as a productline. It uses a set of parallel test tubes, filled with sand-like beads(200-400 mesh). The beads are typically polystyrene, which is stable formost organic molecules, says DeWitt, and they have functionalized sites topermit molecule growth. Diversomer has a 40-PIN synthesizer, as it iscalled, that can make 40 compounds simultaneously.   Reagents, dissolved in solvents, are poured into the tubes and reactwith the functionalized sites. Different combinations of reagents are fedto each tube in a preprogrammed, automatically controlled sequence. Thebeads are washed between steps and all fluids exit through the porous tubebottoms. Finally, the products are recovered from the beads by an acidwash.   DeWitt points out that the system can also be used for processdevelopment tests on a selected product. In this case, the same productwould be put in all the tubes and different reagents or solvents testedsimultaneously to determine which works best.   Others use variations of the bead system. Affymax Inc. (Palo Alto,Calif.), for example, starts with three pots of 10-micrometer-diapolystyrene beads, which are given identification tags, then mixedtogether. They are redivided, randomly, into three lots, each of which isbathed in a solvent that contains a different chemical building block.After every step, each lot is split into three more lots, therebymultiplying the combinations.   Lawrence Berkeley's process, in contrast with the others, is designedfor making and testing complex metal materials in parallel. Compounds arecreated by sputtering individual components, in series, onto specific siteson a substrate. The laboratory has made superconductors andmagnetoresistive materials, and is now working with phosphors,'' says PeterSchultz, a professor of chemistry and a principal in Symyx Technologies(Palo Alto, Calif.), which was set up to commercialize the technology.Initially, Symyx will develop phosphors for flat panel displays, he says.Reference(s):*Fredenslund, A. et al, ``Group Contribution Estimation of ActivityCoefficients in Nonideal Liquid Mixtures,'' A.I.Ch.E.

Today, a few are going beyond compliance and incorporatingmanagement systems under their auditing umbrellas.   Management systems audits evaluate processes that achieve management'sEH&S objectives. Rather than measuring the output of a process - usuallydefined as a compliance audit - a management systems audit appraisesprocess strengths and weaknesses.   Management systems audits aren't new, especially in the EuropeanCommunity, which has been using British Standard 7750 for about two yearsand EMAS, the Eco Audit Management Scheme, since April 1995 (CE, March, p.49). And next year when ISO 14000 is issued, it will probably include somecriteria for management systems audits, especially on corporate policiesand procedures and senior management commitment.   Events in Europe have spurred interest among North American CPI firms;and so have the Canadian and U.S. Responsible Care initiatives - goodexamples of management codes and standards that go beyond compliance.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn't address managementsystems audits in its Interim Policy Statement on auditing in the April 3,1995, (Vol. 60, No. 63) Federal Register. But the Agency says it isconsidering putting some voluntary criteria into its final policydocument.   One of the U.S. pioneers, Arco Chemical, initiated its managementsystems auditing in early 1991. It formed committees to developrequirements in such areas as training, operations, maintenance, and EH&S.   It then measured those management systems' strengths and weaknesses.``The key was having the people that were going to be evaluated intimatelyinvolved in establishing the requirements,'' says James Garland, directorof manufacturing auditing. ``The audits have contributed to tremendousimprovement throughout the company.''   But not everyone is sold on management systems audits. One problem isthat they foster resentment among managers, says Ralph Rhodes, director ofhealth, safety and environmental audits at AlliedSignal. ``Many managerssay, `Tell me what's wrong. I know how to fix it. '''   Rhodes believes that management systems audits are a ``softer'' kind ofaudit than compliance ones. ``You don't have the basic criteria to evaluatethe program as in a compliance audit,'' he says. ``So it's much moredifficult to do, and to convince management of its value.''   Still, AlliedSignal will be developing a series of management systemsaudits next year. The reason: The audits will be useful in finding rootcauses of EH&S problems, bring greater attention to management systems'deficiencies, and communicate across the company's large organizations.   Management systems audits can build a valuable knowledge base as well.Because audit teams have done so many audits and visited so manyfacilities, they accumulate a wealth of information that can be used toprovide workable solutions to a wide range of company problems.   Meanwhile, management systems audits are moving beyond traditional EH&Stopics. They are incorporating issues such as product safety, and including non-owned facilities.   We urge all CPI firms to conduct management systems audits. Companiesmust have good management systems in place because they set the standardsthat drive performance. And good performance always drives compliance.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. A NEW METHANOL-TO-OLEFINS ROUTE IS READY FOR COMMERCIAL USEBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONNorsk Hydro A.S. (Oslo) and UOP Inc. (Des Plaines, Illinois) are offeringthe process for license after completing tests that started last June in a0.5-m.t./d (methanol feed) demonstration plant at Porsgrunn, Norway. Themethanol-to-olefins (MTO) process was developed as a second step in atwo-step conversion of natural gas to ethylene and propylene and can becombined with any commercial methanol-production process, according to thecompanies. For remote locations, where the cost of liquefied natural gasranges from 50 degrees C to $1 per million Btu, the cost of the MTO processis comparable to that of ethane cracking and can be as low as half the costof naphtha cracking, says Henning Reier Nilsen, Hydro's technical directorfor base chemicals.   Methanol is converted in a fluidized-bed reactor at a pressure between 1and 5 bars and a temperature between 350 and 500 degrees C. The processconverts 80% of the carbon to ethylene and propylene, and can be operatedto yield 50% ethylene and 30% propylene, or a 50:50 mixture. UOP developedthe zeolite-type catalyst of silicon-aluminum-phosphorus oxide.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. FIXED-BED CATALYSTS SPEED UP HYDROGENATIONBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONDegussa AG (Frankfurt) has developed a fixed-bed process that uses newRaney catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, where suspendedpowder-catalysts or nickel-supported catalysts are traditionally used. Thenew catalyst types have up to 400% higher activity than the traditionalsuspended ones. Also, they can easily be recycled because they contain nobinders or carrier metal, and are significantly harder than conventionalcarrier-based catalysts, an indication of longer life, says RolandBurmeister, development manager. The new nickel-type catalyst, for example,has a hardness in excess of 300 newtons, compared with less than 50N forthe traditional carrier-based catalyst.   Nickel, cobalt, copper and iron-type catalysts can be produced byDegussa in tablet form from the corresponding metal alloy, with pore sizesup to 0.08 mL/g, which improves catalyst performance, says Burmeister. Likeconventional Raney catalysts, the tablets are then activated in a causticsolution. In their first commercial applications, the cylinder-shapedhydrogenation catalysts are already being used in German chemical and sugarplants, says Burmeister. He adds that the system is economical for plantsrunning upwards of 10,000 m.t./yr.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. REMOVE VOCS WITH A SIMPLER CARBON ADSORPTION SYSTEM . . .By:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONA single vessel, rather than parallel beds, is used in a new carbonadsorption system that has been introduced by Vara International (VeroBeach, Fla.), a division of Calgon Carbon Corp. (Pittsburgh, Pa.). Unlikethe conventional method, in which two or more carbon beds alternatelyadsorb and desorb solvents and volatile organics, Vara's Revolver systemhas one vessel in which the carbon is divided into four chambers, usinginsulated partitions. A cam rotary valve, on a central shaft, continuouslydirects the flow of two streams: the solvent-laden inlet air (SLA), whichis introduced by an inlet blower; and regenerant air or steam.   When a chamber is being regenerated, a pipe that swivels on the shaftseals off that chamber against SLA, while the valve directs the regenerantstream to the chamber. Vara says the single-valve assembly, instead ofmultiple valves and controls, cuts the installed cost by 50%, compared witha conventional, dual-fixed-bed system of similar volume.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No.  . . . OR WITH AN ENERGY-EFFICIENT SORBENT-CATALYST BEDBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONVolatile organic compounds (VOCs), including chlorinated species, areadsorbed and destroyed on a single sorbent-catalyst bed that is beingoffered for license by the University of Akron (Ohio). Because of themethod's simplicity and energy efficiency, the capital and operating costsare expected to be only 60% as much as conventional systems that use carbonadsorption, steam-stripping and thermal destruction, says the inventor,Howard Greene, a professor of chemical engineering.   The key element is that the sorbent also serves as a catalyst foroxidizing the pollutants. The university uses metal-exchanged ormetal-impregnated zeolite pellets, packed in a column. Adsorption is doneat ambient temperature by passing a VOC-laden stream through the bottom ofthe column.   Desorption and catalytic destruction are achieved by electricallyheating the top of the column to the oxidation temperature of 300-400degrees C, then sequentially heating lower sections. During desorption, thestream continues to enter the column -- unlike activated carbon systems,which have parallel beds for adsorption and desorption. In tests, saysGreene, the process has destroyed 99.99% of VOCs.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. ENICHEM'S CATALYST BOOSTS CUMENE THROUGHPUTBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONA new cumene process, developed by Enichem S.p.A. (Milan), will becommercialized in March at Enichem's Porto Torres site, where it willincrease the capacity of existing units by 30-40%, to 50,000-60,000m.t./yr. This will reduce production costs by 20-30%, says FrancescoPignataro, phenol technology manager. Investment costs for a grassrootsfacility are also expected to be lower, he says.   Cumene, a raw material for making phenol, is produced by reactingbenzene with propylene. Enichem will achieve the increased capacity bysubstituting a new beta-zeolite catalyst, which also avoids the toxic wastegenerated by the conventional phosphoric acid catalyst. The reactionconditions, in a fixed-bed adiabatic reactor. are similar to those of thephosphoric acid route, which operates at 700 kP, except that thetemperature is ``considerably lower'' than the conventional 250 degrees C,says Pignataro.    However, the big difference is that the required benzene:propyleneratio is only 4:1, compared with 7:1-8:1 for the conventional process,hence the capacity increase (the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1). The totalyield and selectivity are over 99%, says Pignataro.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. MICROWAVES CUT FINE CHEMICAL DRYING TIMES BY UP TO 95%By:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONBy combining a microwave source with a novel Nutsche filter design, theBelgian company ProCept (Zelzate) claims that it has not only cut thedrying times for pharmaceutical and fine chemical powders by 80-95%, buthasalso eliminated the need for costly supplementary drying with heatednitrogen. The capital cost is about 40% higher than that of a standardNutsche filter with similar peripherals, but this is more than offset bythe advantages, says ProCept.   Developed as part of the European Union-sponsored Craft program, theprocess has been piloted at Solvay's Weesp, Netherlands, plant to dry a 28%solids slurry of fluvoxamine. It cut the time to achieve a 99.9%-dry powderfrom 5 h with a conventional filter dryer, to less than 1 h, says ProCept.   As with a conventional Nutsche filter, the slurry is charged to thebatch vessel and dewatered to about 20% humidity by the unit's rotatingmixer. A 30- to 200-millibar vacuum is then applied to remove moremoisture. Depending on the need, a single 2.4-GHz microwave source of 6 or12 kW supplements the vacuum drying. The method is now limited to polarsolvents, but ProCept plans to extend it to non-polar solvents, which donot absorb microwaves.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. A QUICK WAY TO ASSESS HYDROCARBON CONTAMINATION OF SOIL IN THE FIELD . . .By:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONA field-testing method which measures hydrocarbon contamination in soil inless than 30 minutes has been developed by Shell Research Ltd.(Sittingbourne, England). Present practice requires soil samples to be sentto a laboratory for spectroscopic or chromatographic analysis, which takesseveral days and costs 30-50 British Pounds ($47-$78) per sample, notesdevelopment engineer Gordon Lethbridge. The field test requires noexperienced operator and costs 5-10 British Pounds ($8-$16) per sample. Italso reduces the number of samples needed for confirmation.   Contaminants are extracted from the soil by a proprietary organicsolvent, which also reacts with the aromatic hydrocarbon residues to form acolored complex. The concentration of the complex is measured by a portablecolorimeter operating at 420 nm. The device has been tested in all types ofsoil, including sand, clay and peat, and has a sensitivity of 50 mg/kg ofsoil for diesel or gasoline fuel, according to Lethbridge. Shell iscurrently negotiating with an undisclosed company to commercialize themethod.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No.  . . . AND A CHEAP METHOD TO REMOVE THEMBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONA mobile processing plant, developed by Umwelttechnologie Terra GmbH(Treffurt, Germany) is designed to remove hydrocarbons (HCs) and aromaticsfrom soil or sewage sludge. Compared with incineration processes, whichdestroy HCs and fuse and sterilize the soil, the vacuum process operates atlow temperature and recovers the HCs for possible reuse. Treated soil canbe reused for agriculture.   Contaminated soil is conveyed into an ``okotruck'' (ecotruck).Hydrocarbons (HCs) are evaporated at 50-60 degrees C under a vacuum of 1-8millibar, then the HC-laden exhaust is dedusted and condensed at -10 to +5degrees C. Tests show a reduction of hydrocarbons from 6,300 mg/kg to 14mg/kg, and BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) from 300 mg/kg to 0.36 mg/kg,according to Terra. Up to 30 1-m.t./h units will be built within the next20 months for use on the contaminated sands of Kuwait, as a result ofsuccessful pilot trials with a 1-m.t./h unit. Treatment costs for a1-m.t./h unit are about DM 35/m.t. ($23), compared with DM 80/m.t. ($54)for alternative technologies, says Terra. Units up to 17 m.t./h can bebuilt.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. ULTRASONIC `SALAMANDER' DETECTS CRACKS IN PIPELINESBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONA battery-operated instrumentation package that checks for cracks as it isborne along by the fluid inside a pipe, has been developed by PipetronixGmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany), Fraunhofer-Institut fur zerstorunsfreiePrufverfahren (IzfP; Saarbruchen), and theFraunhofer-Technologie-Entwicklungs-Gruppe (Stuttgart). Until now, crackscould be found only by pressurizing a pipe with water, says IzfP's GerdDobmann, while ultrasonic gages could only measure wall thicknessreductions caused by corrosion.   The RiBprufmolch (literally, crack-inspecting salamander), uses 896ultrasonic transducers, which emit ultrasonic waves at a frequency of 2-4MHz. Echoes from cracks as small as about 0.5 mm are registered and storedin a computer, says Dobmann. The unit fills most of a pipe's diameter andhas plastic seal rings to maintain its position in the pipe. Up to 100kilometers can be covered per inspection before the unit's memory becomesfull or the battery needs recharging. For a crude-oil pipeline, a typicalspeed is about 1 m/s.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. CATALYST GIVES A CALORIE BOOST TO TOWN GASBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONA catalyst developed by NEC Corp. (Tokyo) increases the calorific contentof town gas, derived from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), whilesimultaneously removing the entire poisonous carbon monoxide component. InJapan, LPG is normally converted to a mixture of hydrogen and carbondioxide, using an iron-chromium or copper-zinc catalyst. The mixturecontains 2% CO impurity. As the calorific content of this gas is low --about 2,600 kcal/cubic meters -- butane is added to increase the energy to5,000 kcal/cubic meters before supplying it to households.   Instead of adding butane, NEC uses a palladium-rhodium-alumina catalystto convert the H subscript 2-CO subscript 2-CO gas mixture to methane andwater at 340 degrees C and 1 atm, at the same time converting all the CO tomethane. The methane yield is 100% and the calorific content of the gas is10,500 kcal/cubic meters. All the H subscript 2 is converted, but not allthe CO subscript 2, because for every mole of CO subscript 2 there are onlythree moles of H subscript 2 (four are needed for complete conversion).   NEC says the additional cost for supplying gas to 100,000 householdsequates to only 93/household per year (U.S.90 cents). NEC plans tocommercialize the process, in conjunction with gas companies, but this isnot expected for at least two to three years.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. THIS SORBENT CARES ONLY FOR OXYGENBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONAn adsorbent that reversibly binds twice as much oxygen from air asmaterials now used commercially in non-cryogenic air separation, has beendeveloped by Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (Allentown, Pa.). It alsoemploys chemical discrimination, adsorbing only O subscript 2, the companysays.   The new material, a lithium pentacyanocobaltate -- specifically, Lisubscript 3Co(CN) subscript 5.2DMF -- has adsorbed 55 cubic centermeters/g(2.3 mmol/g) in 10 min under ambient conditions, the highest reported Osubscript 2 capacity for a solid carrier, says Guido Pez, chief scientistfor inorganic and organofluorine chemistry. For comparison, carbonmolecular sieves (CMS) have an equilibrium O2 capacity of about 1 mmol/gand both CMS and zeolites have an equilibrium nitrogen capacity of about 1mmol/g. Both are popular for commercial air separation via pressure swingadsorption (PSA).   Pentacyanocobaltate salts have long been known for their ability to binddioxygen, says Pez, but irreversibly. In Air Products' formulation, thelithium changes that. The company makes the compound by adding a cobaltchloride-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution to a lithium cyanide-DMFsolution, causing a reaction that produces single crystals. These areheated to about 160 degrees C under nitrogen to reach the final product. Intests, the material has lost 15% of its reactivity over 545 cycles, orabout 17 days. For commercial use it needs to have a half-life of at leastone year, so Air Products is planning further tests.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. NEW COMPUTER PROGRAM ACCELERATES HEAT-TRACING DESIGNBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONHeat-tracing systems can be designed in a fraction of the time needed forstandard methods through a new software program that has been introduced byRaychem Corp. (Menlo Park, Calif.). The menu-driven program, TraceCalcPlus, is an improvement over an earlier one marketed by Raychem.   A key feature is that it provides the capability to design for hazardousareas, says Chet Sandberg, Raychem's engineering computing manager. Itincorporates the electrical codes of the U.S., Canada, and the Europeanzone system, and automatically calculates such things as the maximum sheathtemperatures allowable under those codes. It also covers high-temperature,mineral-insulated cable heaters (as well as self-regulating polymer cableheaters), and it specifies control and monitoring equipment to meet designcriteria specified by the designer. A single line that includes all theserequirements can be designed in 3 min., compared with 30 min. for the oldprogram or up to 1 h for manual calculations, says Sandberg.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. A HOT BATH CLEANS UP MIXED RADIOACTIVE WASTESBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONThe first two commercial-scale plants to use a molten metal bath to treatmixed radioactive wastes (hazardous wastes contaminated with low-levelradioactive wastes) are now being started up by Molten Metal TechnologyInc. (MMT; Waltham, Mass.). MMT's process, called Quantum-CEP, uses thecatalytic and solvent properties of a molten-iron bath at 3,000F todissociate complex wastes to their original elements.   One plant, operated by MMT for Westinghouse Electric subsidiaryScientific Ecology Group, Inc. (Oak Ridge, Tenn.), is designed to treat3,000 tons/yr of ion exchange resins contaminated by low-level radioactiveelements. The other, also at Oak Ridge, will be operated by a limitedpartnership between MMT and Lockheed Martin Corp. It will process up to10million lb/yr of mixed radioactive wastes from government and industrysources.   MMT notes that wastes partition into different phases when they dissociate, depending on their composition. This allows non-radioactivematerials to be recovered, some as useful products. In the case ofradioactive elements, those that are volatilized and go into the gas phasemay be recovered for disposal. Others, such as uranium, are concentratedinto a stable, glassy material.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. PHILLIPS PLANS TO COMMERCIALIZE A NEW 1-HEXENE PROCESSBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONAn ethylene-based process for making 1-hexene that produces about 95% ofthe desired product, instead of a range of olefins, will be commercializedby Phillips Petroleum Co. (Bartlesville, Okla.). 1-hexene is a comonomerused for making high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-densitypolyethylene (LLDPE). Phillips, the largest single U.S. producer of HDPE,is piloting the process in a 90-m.t./yr plant and is currently ponderingwhether to commercialize it alone or through a joint venture, says JeffreyBurkinshaw, director of business planning for Phillips' Chemicals Group.   The common route to 1-hexene is the oligomerization of ethylene. Thereare several variations, using different catalysts, says Burkinshaw, butthey all yield only 10-15% 1-hexene, along with a slate of products rangingup to C subscript 30 s. Phillips' process uses a much more selectivechrome-based catalyst.

(HTI), aresearch-and-development company located in Lawrenceville, N.J. Thecatalyst can be retrofitted into existing plants that use HF or H subscript2SO subscript 4, says Vivek Pradhan, a senior research scientist. He addsthat while the catalyst's expected cost of close to 50c/lb may be slightlyhigher than those of current products, the net cost will probably be lowerbecause it will avoid the problems of storing and handling large volumes ofliquid acids.   HTI's catalyst is a Bronsted-acid-treated transition metal oxide that isstable up to 650 degrees C and has shown no noticeable deactivation after72 h, which is when most catalyst degradation occurs, says Pradhan. Intests with a laboratory-scale, continuous-flow unit, it has converted morethan 80% of a C subscript 3-C subscript 4 olefin-isobutane feed into Csubscript 5-C subscript 9 multi-branched paraffins, with over 95%selectivity, he says.

(Portland, Victoria, Australia), will build a12,000-m.t./yr plant to recycle spent potliner from its smelter, using aprocess developed by Ausmelt Ltd. (Dandenong, Victoria) in cooperation withPortland. Spent potliner (SPL), from the electrolytic cells or ``pots'' inwhich aluminum is produced, is a hazardous material that can no longer belandfilled. It is mostly carbon, but is contaminated with up to 15% each offluorine and sodium and up to 0.5% cyanide. Various methods have beendevised to deal with it (CE, May 1994, pp 44-52).   In Ausmelt's process, SPL and flux are smelted at 1,100-1,200 dergees C,while oxygen is blown into the melt through a submerged lance to fuel theprocess. O subscript 2 is used, rather than air, to increase theconcentration of hydrogen fluoride in the offgas. This makes it easier totreat the HF, points out Peter King, executive director of Ausmelt. Somefluoride combines with the sodium, and sodium fluoride is filtered from thebaghouse and returned to the furnace. Cyanide is destroyed and the carbonis burned, leaving an inert slag. Everything left can be recycled, saysKing. Ausmelt is reviewing options for the slag, including roadfill, and isdeveloping a process to convert the HF to aluminum fluoride, used as asmelter additive.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. PULSE COMBUSTOR HELPS TO GASIFY BLACK LIQUORBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONA steam-reforming process for gasifying black liquor in pulp and paperplants and recovering byproducts will be commercialized by ThermoChem Inc.(Columbia, Md.) and Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. (Boston, Mass.),following a successful demonstration at the New Bern, N.C., plant ofWeyerhaeuser Co. (Tacoma, Wash.). Currently, black liquor is burned inchemical-recovery boilers, which capture sodium carbonate and sodiumsulfide for reuse in the mill. However, the boilers' recovery efficiency ispoor and they emit sulfur compounds, says Gary Voelker, ThermoChem's chiefoperating officer.   In ThermoChem's process, black liquor (70 wt.% solids) is steam-reformedat 1,050-1,150F in a fluidized bed that is indirectly heated by the exhausttubes of a pulse combustor. Pulse combustors burn fuel rapidly, producingpulses that resonate along an exhaust tube. The fluidized bed in the2.5-ton/h demonstration plant has three combustors, each with 72 tubes thatresonate at 60 Hz. This improves heat transfer into the bed, says Voelker.   The gasifier produces a 300-400-Btu/scf, hydrogen-rich gas for plantfuel and for the pulse combustor. Sodium sulfate in the liquor is convertedto hydrogen sulfide and sodium carbonate. A solution of the latter is usedto scrub H subscript 2S from the product gas, regenerating green liquor foruse in the mill.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. THE GROWTH RATE IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING GRADUATIONS ACCELERATESBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONOn the heels of a 12% increase in the size of the U.S. graduating class in1994, the 1995 figure was up 16%, to 6,153. The numbers come from an annualreport on degrees awarded, published by the Engineering WorkforceCommission (Washington, D.C.). The increase contrasts starkly with thetotal number of all types of engineering graduates, which has remained flatfor the past two years. For 1995, that figure was 64,749, virtuallyunchanged from the year before.   ``These trends are very similar to what was reported last year,'' saysRichard Ellis, research director of EWC's parent, the American Assn. ofEngineering Societies. ``Over the years, chemical engineering has tended toshow a wavelike pattern of peaks and troughs'' in enrollments, and thenumbers reflect an upward swing that began in 1991. He attributes thepopularity to high starting salaries -- just under $40,000, according tothe National Assn. of Colleges and Employers (Bethlehem, Pa.), the highestof any baccalaureate graduates currently.   The number of M.S.Ch.E. degrees rose 5.2%, to 1,214. Doctorate Ch.E.degrees were 636, down 9% from the year before.Illustration(s):Illustration: Graph: CPI Capital Spending IndexCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. CHLORINE RECOVERY PROCESS MAY SAVE WASTE AND MONEYBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONTechnology to recover chlorine from waste hydrogen chloride that has beenpiloted at Carburos Metlicos S.A. (Barcelona, Spain), an affiliate of AirProducts and Chemicals Inc. (Allentown, Pa.), will be further developed bya consortium of major chemical companies headed by Air Products. It couldsave chemical companies millions of dollars, as 25-33% of chlorineproduction ends up as waste HCl from chemicals production (CE, June 1992,p. 21).   Developed by Ronald Minet, an adjunct professor of chemical engineeringat the University of Southern California (Los Angeles), the process reactsHCl over a copper oxide catalyst at 5-10 psig and about 200 degrees C,forming copper chloride and water vapor. The CuCl subscript 2 is reactedwith air or oxygen at 5-10 psig and 360 degrees C, releasing the chlorineand regenerating the catalyst. The consortium plans further testing inSpain, followed by a technology demonstration if an engineering evaluationproves favorable.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. COAL REPLACES COKE IN IRONMAKING PROJECTBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONFull-scale tests of a technology that could reduce significantly the volumeof pollutants produced by the iron and steel industry have begun inChesterton, Ind., where Bethlehem Steel Corp. (Bethlehem, Pa.) haspartially substituted coal for coke in two blast furnaces. In ironmaking,about 1,000 lb of coke is used per ton of metal, but because cokemakingproduces a lot of air pollutants the industry is seeking ways to avoid itsuse (CE, Mar. 1995, pp 37-41).    Coke is used as the reductant because it has more carbon than coal,but oil or natural gas are injected as fuel. In the tests, coal isreplacing those more-costly fuels, but because it helps with reduction italso offsets coke use, notes Douglas Jewell, project manager for the U.S.Dept. of Energy in Morgantown, W.Va., which is supporting the tests. Also,the coal is being injected in granular form, saving 50% in grinding costs.The technology for handling granular coal was developed by British SteelCorp., says Jewell, but so far has been used at less than half the scale ofthe Bethlehem tests. Bethlehem is injecting 225 lb of coal per ton of hotmetal in two 7,000-net tons/d blast furnaces, and may increase that to asmuch as 400 lb/ton during the 32-month tests.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. EPA INCREASES PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMITTINGBy:EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSONCompanies planning to start up hazardous-waste facilities will have to bemore diligent about informing the public in future.

The new permit, the first of its kind in the U.S.,is designed to streamline and make pollution prevention an integral part ofthe plant permitting process.   Now being evaluated by New Jersey, the program focuses on the totalamount of pollutants generated by a facility, using a holistic approach. Anumber of environmental agencies throughout the U.S. and Canada areconsidering the new permitting approach. ``It is quickly becoming anational model for regulatory reform,'' says N.J.D.E.P.'s assistantcommissioner, Catherine Cowan.   A facility wide permit (FWP) is a single permit issued by N.J.D.E.P. tothe owner or operator of a priority* industrial facility, incorporatingpermits, certificates, registrations and other approvals. The draft permitreplaces all existing facility permits and can be renewed after fiveyears.   Huntsman's FWP covers over 200 individual sources of air emissions,discharges of storm water through four permitted outfalls, and the storageand management of hazardous waste in three tanks. For Huntsman, the singlepermit will replace 80 different permits for individual process units, andreduce 10 thick binders' worth of paperwork into a 1.5-in packet.   More importantly, the process evaluation that Huntsman went through toapply for the permit has resulted in the elimination of 8.5 million lb ofemissions per year. It will also remove the need for titaniumtetrachloride, isopropyl alcohol, hydrogen chloride, diethyl aluminumchloride, cyclohexane, triethylamine, and isopentane.   The critical first step in the permitting process is running a completematerials account and chemicals inventory. Emissions from every processline in the plant must be measured, and the results tabulated, either inpounds per hour, or tons per year.   Taking one inventory for the entire plant, instead of individualaccounts for separate process units, gets operators in touch with what isactually going on. ``In many plants, data are old, and no one knows exactlywhat is flowing in every pipe,'' explains Jeanne Herb, director of theN.J.D.E.P.'s Office of Pollution Prevention.   The next step is to design process modifications, and tabulate the newemissions levels that will result from those changes. Numbers of primeinterest are pounds of waste before treatment and pounds of waste per poundof product, says Brian O'Reilly, a chemical engineer with N.J.D.E.P.'sOffice of Pollution Prevention.   Plant operators can then calculate reduction levels for five years. Atthis point, they submit their first application to the N.J.D.E.P. forreview. The Environmental Protection office then makes recommendations,the plant operators alter their permits, resubmit it, and the processcontinues.   Designed to replace the old adversarial interaction between plantoperators and enforcement officers, the new permit fosters opencommunication. It is just this kind of two-way feedback that has made theprogram a success so far, says N.J.D.E.P.'s Herb. ``Top down commitment isrequired,'' she says, and Huntsman's modernization team leader Frank Gorskiworked closely with N.J.D.E.P.'s O'Reilly to get the process moving.   The consulting firm, Environmental Resources Management Group (Ewing,N.J.), also helped, by organizing data from existing environmental permitsinto the new format, completing an inventory of air emissions that hadnever been inventoried before, evaluating reasonable available controltechnology for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the plant's wastewatertreatment unit, and monitoring and reporting on decreasing air emissions atthe unit. For Huntsman, getting final approval took two years. It alsoresulted in a plan for significant improvements to the 325-million-lb/yrfacility, for $25 million.   The biggest change will involve altering the polymerization process byusing a new, high-activity catalyst. According to Huntsman staff engineerCharles Augustine, the new catalyst harmlessly disperses itself into theproduct as it deactivates, so there is no disposal problem. It is also tentimes as active as the old catalyst, which had required a separate disposaland polymer cleaning unit. In addition, the modernization processeliminates the need for 107 out of 350 pieces of plant equipment.   New Jersey Governor Christie Whitman and N.J.D.E.P. Commissioner, BobShinn, who presented the permit to company vice-chairman, John HuntsmanJr., and president, Ronald Rasband, enthusiastically support the newpermitting approach. ``It will save New Jersey jobs,'' Whitman said.   So far, Huntsman is the third company in New Jersey to receive this typeof permit. The first was Schering-Plough in Kenilworth, which receive anFWP in December, 1994. The second, Frigidaire Corp. in Edison, alsoreceived an FWP last month. Next month, Jim Kiel, manager of environmentalaffairs for The Geon Co. (Pedricktown), says his company expects to receivean FWP for an expansion of its polyvinyl chloride resin and compoundplant.   In March, N.J.D.E.P. will issue a report to the State Legislaturerecommending that the program be made permanent. For Huntsman, the permithelped make the difference between having to shut down the nation's oldestpolypropylene unit, and being able to keep it running efficiently. ``We'recelebrating the lack of bureaucracy in New Jersey,'' said Huntsmanpresident Rasband.Photograph(s):Photograph: New Jersey Governor Whitman and officials present Huntsman withits FWP* ``Priority'' refers to the five SIC codes that usually report the highestlevels of Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) emissionsCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS WRAP UP THE BUSINESS YEARThe mergers and acquisitions that marked last year continued in December,which saw the launching of Fluor Daniel/GTI, a merger between GroundwaterTechnology (Norwood, Mass.) and the California-based engineering andconstruction firm (p. 37).

RajagopalIndia is emerging as a major market for environmental technologies, asmore environmental equipment and services companies from the U.S. andCanada explore new opportunities opened up by ongoing reform and tighterenvironmental controls. German companies are also offering technologypackages meeting European Union standards, according to Hartmut Krebs,deputy minister of North Rhine Westphalia's Ministry of Economics,Transport and Technology Division.   According to a recent report by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce (Washington,D.C.), India is soon to become a major market for U.S.environmental-service and equipment-manufacturing companies, with annualdemand expected to grow by 25%/yr through the end of the decade.Technologies tailored to the energy and transportation sectors, solid wastemanagement and recycling will be India's main areas of interest.   For U.S. firms, composting, pelletization, waste-to-energy conversion,and water treatment will all be target areas. As of last month, when U.S.and Canadian environmental trade delegations visited India, nearly 300 U.S.companies were seeking joint ventures and collaborations, as well aslicensing agreements, with Indian companies, says one delegation member,Jay Novak, Commissioner of Minnesota's Dept. of Trade and EconomicDevelopment.   In addition, roughly 40 Canadian environmental equipment suppliers haveshown interest in collaborating with the Indian companies, according tointernational consultant, Richard Denham. Among the most active areAnderson Operations, Inc. and RV Anderson Associ-ates, Ltd. (Ottawa), andthe Ontario National Trade Corp. Effluent and sewage treatment will be anarea of focus for Ontario International Trade, says the company's assistantdirector, Murray Jans. In one project, the Canadian firm will collaboratewith PHE Consultants (Bombay) on a range of water-pollution-controloptions.    Ontario International will also execute a six-year-old, $3-millioncontract with the Bombay Municipal Development Corp., funded by the WorldBank. Anderson Operations, Inc. will provide a $500,000 (Canadian) grantto help fund the project, according to Sanjay Devnani, business developmentmanager with AOI India, the Canadian Energy Corp.   Reusing flyash is the focus of other international environmentalprojects in India. Working in this area is India Ash Products, Ltd., aconsortium of the U.S. -based ReUse Technologies, a subsidiary of CogentrixEnergy, and India's India Ash Products LLC and Birla Institute of TechnicalServices. India generates 45 million m.t./yr, of which only 2.5% is reused,according to Birla Institute vice president, D. Chatterjee. The Indiangovernment has already begun programs designed to replace conventionalindustrial boilers with circulating fluidized bed boilers.   Some Indian-U.S. ventures are already up and running, including theBangalore based Kirloskar Ltd., a joint -venture between India's KirloskarGroup and Snyder General, Inc. of the U.S. The venture has recently signeda collaborative agreement with Malaysia's Hiong Leong Industrial Group, toexecute turnkey environmental projects in Asean nations and the Far East.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. ISO UPDATE, JANUARY 1996ISO NEWSCertification: a must for plastics firms?

HAIRSTONWhether dispersants are used to suspend pigments in paints and coatings, toprevent flocculation in pulp slurries, or to improve adhesion of fillers inpolymers, there is no doubt that they work. Exactly how dispersants workand what else they can be made to do are questions that suppliers arescrambling to answer.   For companies that make and market dispersants, such information isvital to the development of surfactant and polymeric dispersing agents thatare environmentally friendly, cost effective and multifunctional. Thesearch for clues has them investigating the molecular behavior of solids inliquids, trying to unravel the secrets of their surface interactions.   Several factors are driving suppliers to extract more mileage from theirproducts. Traditionally, formulators have relied upon their technicalknow-how to make dispersants. But there is an element of art in what theydo, too. While chemists dabble with different compounds to achieve desiredresults, the trial-and-error method is an imperfect one that may haveunforeseen consequences for the process, the product, or the environment.   To optimize production and reduce contaminants, such risks have to beminimized. Furthermore, a more thorough knowledge of dispersants wouldallow formulators to eliminate the bad actors, upping purity andperformance.   ``Previously we sold products in unit operations, but now we have tolook at the impact on the total operation,'' says Terry Say, director oftechnology for paper and textile chemicals at Rhone-Poulenc Inc. (Cranbury,N.J). ``At the very least, we want to be sure that the solution doesn'thave a detrimental effect downstream. Preferably, we would like thedispersant to have some beneficial effect.''   The challenge of finding those solutions is only intensified byenvironmental regulations that prohibit or restrict the use of certainchemicals in dispersants and dispersions. For example, many solvent-baseddispersions are being replaced with aqueous ones.   This changeover is increasing demand for dispersants that can perform inwater. And existing chemicals are expected to be the primary source of anynew dispersants. ``There is a lot of synergy that we don't exploit,'' saysSay. ``We can use that information to solve customers' problems.''   Typical of the research underway is that being done at the PolymerInterfaces Center at Lehigh University (Bethlehem, Pa.), which issupported by ten industrial companies. Work there is focused on three areas-- adsorption, wetting and adhesion, and mechanical behavior.   Currently, the center is studying pigment dispersants and thickeners tolearn exactly what the molecules are doing and how to stabilize them in amedium, usually water, against settling and flocculation, and maintain thisstability in the dry state. ``The world has known for a long time how to dothis with solvents, but water-based materials offer new and more demandingchallenges to develop good adhesion, especially under wet conditions,''says Andrew Mercurio, the center's associate director for knowledgetransfer.   Novel formulations of organometallic coupling agents based on titanateshave been shown to act as dispersants and as catalysts in unfilled andfilled polymers, says Salvatore Monte, president of Kenrich Petrochemicals,Inc. (Bayonne, N.J.). Monte cites an IBM patent for magnetic recordingdisks containing an iron oxide-filled resin treated with the firm's KR 38Spyrophosphate titanate. The coupling agent disperses and chemically bondsthe iron particles to the resin. And the agent ``catalyzes the resin toprovide strength and durability without alumina particulatereinforcements.''   In another case, Asahi Chemical Industry has used Kenrich products toimprove the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene. This and otherresearch has led Monte to speculate that titanate coupling agents can beused in situ like metallocene catalysts.   Industry observers are skeptical. ``Organometallics have some dualfunctionality, but their application as metallocene catalysts may bestretching it a bit far,'' says Say.Environmentally friendlyThe range of applications for dispersants is as varied as the industries inwhich they are used. But across-the-board, they are being formulated to becompatible with environmentally friendly processes.   For example, demand for copolymer dispersants for water treatment isgrowing at about 5%/yr, diminishing the popularity of homopolymers, forwhich demand is now virtually flat. The trend reflects the move away fromheavy-metal corrosion inhibitors and the growing use of alternatives, suchas phosphates. ``The chemistry that worked with old programs doesn't worknow,'' says Bob Zuhl, business manager for water-treatment chemicals at BFGoodrich Co. (Akron, Ohio).   Last fall, BF Goodrich introduced two general-purpose dispersants forboiler-water treatment. Good-Rite K-765 and 766 fill a gap in the company'sproduct line for dispersants based on sodium polymethacrylates. Free offormaldehyde and ammonia, the products are ``greener and safer than somecomparable products,'' says Zuhl. The dispersants meet U.S. guidelines forboiler-water additives, and are chemically acceptable as boiler-watertreatment compounds proposed for use in meat and poultry plants.   Under pressure to recover and reuse water, chemical processors arelooking for high-performance dispersants that can work at higher cycles ofconcentration, says Zuhl. The type of dispersant required for a coolingtower will vary, depending on the source of the makeup water. The use ofrecycled municipal wastewater, for example, may require a treatmentprogram, including dispersant, that is tailored for organic, nutrient-richwater.   To help pulp mills ease the bottlenecks encountered as they attempt toclose up their water systems, BetzPaper Chem Inc. (Jacksonville, Fla.)custom-blended surfactants and dispersants. The formulation, CustomSperseimproves pulp mill washing by more than 50%, says Darin Pekarek, a productspecialist for the company. The wash aid lowers the carryover of organics,saltcake, total dissolved solids as well as pitch.   Efforts of paint formulators to eliminate solvents from their systemsprompted Air Products and Chemicals (Allentown, Pa.) to includesolvent-free dispersants and grind aids in its line of of Surfynolsurfactants. For example, CT-131 is a grind aid for aqueous pigment wettingand dispersion.   Also in the Air Products surfactant line are other dispersants thatprovide multiple benefits. For example, CT-136 is recommended for grindingand dispersion of pigments in aqueous media. But the product is alsosuitable for universal-type dispersions, including glycol solvent-tintbases for water-based or solvent-based inks and coatings. In addition, thecompany makes CT-141, a low-molecular-weight dispersant for aqueous pigmentdispersions.Multiple benefitsSimilarly, Rhone-Poulenc sells a full line of dispersions, includingpolymeric formulations for aqueous systems. Based on carboxyl functionalpolymers in a range of molecular weights, these products are particularlypromising, says Rhone-Poulenc's Say. The company is currently looking atdifferent types of monomers that can be incorporated into thelow-molecular-weight polymers.   As a major producer of paints and coatings, PPG Industries (Pittsburgh,Pa.) can draw on its considerable inhouse resources. The firm's Mazsperseagents are available for organic and inorganic pigments, as well as solventand water-based coatings. Mazsperse 85B, which is good for dispersingcarbon black, is formulated for applications where low foam is required.   Three fluorochemical surfactants developed by the Specialty ChemicalsDiv. of 3M (St. Paul, Minn.) are useful as dispersants. However, FluoradFC-129, 143 and 118 are applicable only for the manufacture offluorochemical-based polymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), saysLeo Gehlhoff, a technical service specialist for the company. The advantageof FC-118, a 20% active, anionic solution of ammonium perfluorooctanoate inwater, is that it can be reclaimed and recycled from the fluoropolymermanufacturing process.   Meanwhile, much of the new research will determine how a dispersant sitson the surface of a polymer. Knowing this will allow producers to designgreater functionality per molecule. Says Lehigh's Mercurio: ``That will goa long way towards improving a dispersant's efficiency and coststructure.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. PADDLE DRYER REMOVES WATER AND SOLVENTSA continuous indirect dryer, this system has been redesigned to providehigher evaporation rates in a smaller unit.

Stewart and Dale A. Seiberling, Seiberling Associates, Inc.Edited by Jayadev Chowdhury  CIP for the CPIThe CIP design techniques discussed here have been recently applied to anindustrial chemical process, and its success establishes CIP's potentialfor cleaning a wide variety of equipment. The success is due to the clienttaking a prudent risk to apply a technology that's new, and by integratingCIP and process design efforts up front.   The client wanted an integrated process and CIP system capable ofsequentially producing seven highly potent compounds with very-lowcross-contamination limits. The original cleaning objectives were:  Control cross-contamination between products to less than 10 ppm.Existing systems could achieve no lower than 200 ppm cross-contaminationthrough flushing, boil-up, water-blasting and hand-cleaning  Achieve a changeover from one product to another in less than threedays.  The existing plant required 14 days  Improve safety by eliminating water blasting, vessel entry, and extensivedismantling of equipment  Reduce aqueous and organic waste by 80%  Reduce labor required for changeovers   The CIP system and overall process were designed and integrated rightfrom the beginning. The result is a CIP-able plant that includes therequired vent lines to an incinerator and an accompanying dry-vacuum systemfor handling spills. To date, there have been 12 product turnarounds in theplant, and the CIP results have exceeded objectives.   Figure A shows this multi-product plant with bulk-powder handling,reactions in glass-lined vessels, centrifuging, drying, and dustcollection. The final products are very potent (active in smallconcentrations), and so the equipment is vented through primary, secondaryand final HEPA filters.   All the piping and equipment (including three dust-collection systems)are cleaned by a single skid-mounted CIP unit (Figure B), with linecircuits and fixed sprays for vessels, heat exchangers, screws, bins, dustcollectors, centrifuges and ducts. During cleaning, the CIP solution isrecirculated at around 300 gal/min, and sequenced through the plant viasupply and return valves controlled by a distributed process-controlsystem.   The process fluid is corrosive, so most of the equipment is constructedof Hastelloy, or glass- or polytetrafluoroethylene-lined steel. Figure Cshows how Hastelloy spray balls and supply tubes are installed in vessels,and interfaced via a flanged joint to less-expensive PTFE-lined pipe.   The first drum of the new material exiting the dryer is analyzed forcross-contamination of the previous product. In the majority of cases,there has been no detectable cross-contamination. The maximum contaminationthat has been detected is 1.5 ppm.   The CIP system's high performance is causing the company to considerextending CIP techniques to two new products. These products are highlysensitive to cross-contamination, but now can now be produced in the samemulti-product facility, cancelling millions of dollars in investment thatwas previously planned for a new plant.Clean In Place (CIP) is an essential production tool that's savingcompanies in many chemical process industries (CPI) millions of dollars inoperating costs and investment. CIP is an automated method of cleaningprocess plants, involving little or no dismantling of piping or equipment.   In the cleaning cycle, CIP brings flushing, washing, rinsing and (often)sanitizing solutions into continuous and close contact with all wettedequipment surfaces to remove product ``soil.'' The cleaning processinvolves both chemical and physical aspects, and generally requiresrecirculation to minimize water, chemical and waste-treatment costs.   CIP has been widely applied in dairy, brewing, food and wine processingfor more than 35 years; more recently, CIP has found acceptance inpharmaceutical, biotechnology and other batch-processing operations.However, other CPI sectors, including industrial chemicals, agriculturalproducts, petrochemicals and petroleum refining, have paid little attentionto this highly effective cleaning technique.   The primary reasons include a lack of knowledge and understanding ofCIP-based cleaning technologies, and a reluctance to change. As a result,these industries continue to carry out their cleaning chores using``boilups,'' flushing, high-pressure water blasting, and manual scrapingand vacuuming.Why CIP?There are three primary reasons for using CIP. The first - and mostimportant - is that CIP is far superior to any other cleaning method. WithCIP, each cleaning program is the same as the previous one; thisrepeatability, in turn, translates to reliability.   Offspec or contaminated products, which result in lost production orcostly rework, can be eliminated using CIP. The steps or sequencing in CIPcleaning are fully automated through programmable logic controllers (PLC),distributed control systems (DCS), or other automated controllers. Thus,human errors associated with manual cleaning are eliminated.   The driving force for CIP's rapid adoption in the pharmaceutical andbiotechnology industries lies in the more-stringent validation requirementsof the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. CIP makes FDA validation and ISO9000 accreditation easier to accomplish than is possible with othercleaning methods, which exhibit a greater degree of variability.   The second reason for using CIP is lower operating costs. With CIP,labor costs are reduced because cleaning is fully automated and there isminimal or no dismantling of equipment. The turnaround time required forcleaning is reduced, increasing plant capacity.   Also, water and solvents for cleaning are significantly reduced. This isparticularly important if pure (and costly) water is used for cleaning, orif the solvent wastes have to be incinerated.   The third reason for using CIP is safety improvement. Plant personnel nolonger have to dismantle equipment, using ladders or temporary supports.Time-consuming and dangerous vessel entry is not required, nor are suchinherently hazardous activities as manual scraping, vacuuming andhigh-pressure water blasting.   Safety is also improved when cytotoxic products are cleaned fromfacilities. CIP greatly reduces any possible exposure of personnel to suchproducts, compared with disassembly and manual cleaning of equipment.CIP's basic conceptsAn integral part of the earliest ``automated'' CIP installations ispermanently installed supply-and-return piping that is separate from thefacilities' process piping. For example, in dairy processes (Figure 1),some food plants, and in portions of some pharmaceutical facilities, it isnecessary to be able to clean process and storage vessels during theproduction run. A number of the vessels may contain product when theprocess piping is subsequently cleaned in place.   The 3-A Accepted Practices for Permanently Installed Sanitary Pipelinesand Cleaning Systems require that ``All connections between the solutionscircuit(s) and the product circuit(s) shall be constructed as to positivelyprevent the co-mingling of product and solution during processing.'' Thisregulatory requirement is generally complied with by installing dedicatedpiping to convey flush, wash and rinse solutions from a central CIPrecirculation unit to all of the plant's tanks, transport tankers, andproduct-piping circuits.   Dedicated CIP supply and return piping. The supply of cleaning solutionsto the storage-tank sprays is controlled with air-operated valves andU-bend cleaning hookup stations (floverters), thus ensuring that only onetank is connected at a time to the cleaning system. The flow ofpost-cleaning solutions from the storage tanks is generally carried out bypositioning a movable elbow between the tank's outlet valve and a permanentCIP return header connected to a return pump.   Tankers are cleaned with drop-in spray devices or permanently installedsprays, supplied with a hose; tanker return flow is carried out via a hoseto a return pump. Check valves in the return system ensure the continuousmovement of flush, wash and rinse solutions from the return pumps to therecirculating unit.   Integrated process and CIP piping. The evolution of the above concept toa modern, high-capacity dairy process is illustrated in Figure 2, whichincludes a high-capacity high-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurizationsystem with a plate heat exchanger (pasteurizer), homogenizer andself-cleaning centrifuge (the latter is in the background and not visiblein the photo). The ``all welded'' piping to and from the remainder of theprocess is cleaned from a central, automatic CIP system.   The HTST process is cleaned with the available process pumps, valves,controls and heat-exchange equipment that are configured and controlled toclean at the end of the production run. The required manual connections arefacilitated by two U-bend transfer panels (center left, Figure 2). In many``extended shelf-life'' milk plants in the U.S. and Canada, all piping,flow-control valves, pasteurized surge tanks and fillers downstream of theHTST process in Figure 2 are cleaned in a single high-volume circuit aftereach days' processing and packaging.   Since integrated process-and-CIP piping systems use product piping toconvey flush, wash and rinse solutions to the tanks and packaging machines,capital and operating costs, water and chemical usage, and labor aregreatly reduced. At the same time, quality is substantially improved byeliminating the recontamination that accompanies manual connections.   The CIP equipment in modern dairies is installed in centrally locatedCIP equipment rooms (Figure 3). The equipment for supplying the alkalineand acid chemicals, water conditioners and sanitizing solutions aregenerally located adjacent to the CIP recirculating units.   Varied applications. Whereas CIP cleaning was initially used only forliquid food processes, the labor savings and the high reliability andperformance of the CIP systems eventually led to the redesign of severaldry, granular processes. A generic food process for dry granular process,shown in Figure 4, is a small-scale representation of some very successfulapplications.   Here, the entire process is designed to be CIP-able, by allowingmaterials to drain to one or more collection points. Each spray shown inFigure 4 represents a multiplicity of sprays, supplied by a common valvefrom the primary CIP supply line. Flush, wash and rinse solutions are movedprogressively through the process, from top to bottom, under automaticcontrol.   For instance, a major food plant was designed to permit simultaneousinternal CIP (food-product contact surfaces) and external CIP (non-foodcontact surfaces, support structures, service lines, and so on), usingseparate CIP recirculation units. Further, a sanitary floor was employed tocollect the CIP solutions for the external systems.   CIP has also been applied to large and complex process systems, such asmilk and whey evaporators, and dryers. These concepts, found suitable forthe food spray dryers, were later proven equally applicable to typical meatsmokehouses (Figure 5).   In pharmaceutical and biotechnology plants, well-engineered CIP systemscan help achieve controlled cleaning, freedom from recontamination,improved product containment, and higher operator safety. CIP systems canalso contribute to the required degree of automation of both batchprocesses and the accompanying tank-to-tank transfers. The generic processshown in Figure 6 represents one of a multiplicity of similar tanks ofvarying sizes, and shows how automatic valves can be combined with U-bendtransfer panels to satisfy the process automation, flexibility andisolation requirements of such plants.   These techniques are transferrable to most CPI plants, as has beendemonstrated in many liquid, slurry and solids processes in the last fewyears. However, to ensure proper results, it is critical that the plant'sequipment must be designed for CIP.   To date, most types of equipment have been cleaned successfully by CIP,including:-- Vessels with agitators, baffles and auxiliary equipment-- Pumps, valves and piping, centrifuges and filters, dryers, evaporatorsand heat exchangers-- Dump stations, dust collectors and bins-- Rotary valves and slide valves-- Sifters, mills and blenders-- Screw and belt conveyors-- Distillation columns-- Packaging machinesDesign criteriaCIP is most effective when the process and CIP systems are designed andintegrated early in a project's development. Equal consideration should begiven to CIP and process design. Process equipment and piping designed tobe CIP-cleanable should meet the following minimum criteria:All the equipment that comes into contact with cleaning solutions should bemade of corrosion-resistant and cleanable materials, such as stainlesssteel, or lined with glass or polytetrafluoroethylene. Less-exoticmaterials will be corroded by cleaning solutions, which normally containsuch chemicals as caustic, acid and sodium hypochlorite.   The equipment must be designed to confine the cleaning solutions.Typical dust-handling equipment may not be water-tight, which would allowCIP cleaning solutions to spill onto the floor and on the outside ofequipment.   The equipment, must be drainable with no pockets or ledges. The bottomsof flat vessels should pitch not less than 1/4 in. per ft, from rear tofront outlet, and 1/2 in. per ft from side to center, to provide reasonableflow across the surfaces for moving suspended solids.   All corners - whether horizontal or vertical - should be rounded, with aminimum radius of 1 in.   Gaskets and seals should be crevice-free, non-absorbent, non-reactive,non-porous, and positioned to eliminate non-cleanable crevices. Gaskets andseals used in the dairy, food and pharmaceutical industries must be made ofFDA-approved elastomers.   Flanges and interconnecting fittings in piping should be minimized   Piping dead ends and branches should be employed sparingly   All valves should be cleanable. Generally, only two types of valves areconsidered CIP cleanable: air-operated, sanitary compression valves (Figure7), and air-operated diaphragm valves.   Depending on the cleanliness required, other types of valves, such asbutterfly, rotary, check, slide and ball valves have also been cleanedsuccessfully with CIP. Special CIP solution-injection ports must beprovided to clean the seal areas of several of these valves   Mass, vortex and magnetic flowmeters are considered CIP cleanable   Use of hoses should be minimized, and the best location for gages are invertical pipe runs   All piping and ducts should be pitched 1/16 to 1/8 in. per ft to drainports   A detailed list of CIP design criteria is available in References 3, 4and 6.Controllable factorsThe most important factors influencing the effectiveness of CIP cleaningare cleaning time; cleaning agent temperature, concentration and chemistry;degree of turbulence of the cleaning solution (physical action); and thecharacteristics (cleanability) of the surface being cleaned. These factorshave a synergistic effect on cleaning performance. The right chemistrycombined with the right concentration, temperature and time will yield acleaning regimen that best fits a system's needs. The variables are bestevaluated in a laboratory setting before commercial facilities aredesigned.   Selection of cleaners. CIP is greatly dependent on chemical action. As ageneral rule of thumb, most residues are easily removed with a dilute (1%or less), formulated alkaline cleaner. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are thebuilding blocks for most of the chemicals produced today, and these bondsare easily broken apart in hot alkaline conditions.   The most common and aggressive alkaline cleaner is sodium hydroxide(NaOH), and is typically used in 0.15-0.5% concentrations fornon-heat-transfer surfaces, and at 1-5% for plate-type and tubular heatexchangers, and other heavily soiled surfaces.   Depending on the water quality and soil, several types of additives areoften integrated into the cleaning solution. Chelating agents are used insystems where hard water is a problem. Sodium hypochlorite is added toalkaline solutions at levels of 30-100 ppm, to enhance the removal of bothfat and protein soiling.   A lightly acidified final rinse aids in removing all traces of alkalineproduct from equipment surfaces, enhancing draining and drying, andproviding bacteriostatic conditions that delay the growth of organismsfound in most sources of water supply. Strong, hot acid solutions may beapplied in sequence before or after alkaline solutions to cleanheat-exchange equipment.A typical CIP cleaning cycleCleaning cycles and the choice of cleaning chemicals depends on the type ofsoil. While many variations exist, the following is a typical cleaningcycle:  1. Pre-rinse with the lowest grade of water available or with recoveredsolution. The purpose of this step is to remove as much ``loose'' soil aspossible prior to the formulated alkaline wash. Pre-rinsing of most organicfat, carbohydrate or proteinaceous soil is generally accomplished withambient temperature water or warm recovered solution  2. Alkaline wash with recirculated, formulated solutions. This sequencebrings hot (typically 55-80C), chemical-laden solution into intimatecontact with all soiled surfaces. Since relatively long contact times arerequired for this primary cleaning step, recirculation of the cleaningsolution is essential for economical operation  3. Post-rinse with water, normally at ambient temperature. This step isto rinse away most of the residual alkaline cleaner. This solution issometimes recovered for the pre-rinse in the next CIP cleaning program.  4. Acid rinse, normally at ambient temperature with recirculated acidsolutions. The purpose of this step is two-fold:   The acid rinse will neutralize and remove residual alkaline cleaner.Alkaline cleaners form ``films'' on equipment that are not readily removedby a simple post-rinse with water   The acid rinse will also remove mineral deposits, left by the water usedin the chemical solution and rinses, from the cleaned surfaces  5. Post-rinse with water or recirculated sanitizing rinse, used to applya bactericidal agent to all cleaned surfaces. The post-rinse is oftenheated to permit fast drying of equipment. Some plants follow thepost-rinse with heated air, blown through the CIP sprays or separate supplyports, to aid in equipment dryingThe CIP circuitsIn some applications, an entire process, or an easily isolated portion of alarge process, is shut down and cleaned in its entirety. Other processesmay require a vessel or transfer line to be cleaned while the remainingprocess equipment is used to manufacture product. In this situation, U-bendtransfer panels (Figure 8) with interlocked proximity switches are used toseparate the cleaning solution from the product.   Swing elbows, leak-protection valves and double block-and-bleed(mix-proof) systems are other methods of isolating the cleaning solutionfrom the product or from the equipment that must be kept dry. With properproduct isolation, CIP solutions can be circulated in various types ofcleaning circuits even while product processing continues. Cleaningcircuits typically have the following characteristics:   CIP solutions are normally pumped through process piping that is 4 in.in diameter, or less. This is because cleaning effectiveness is enhanced byphysical action due to turbulent flow.   Piping systems can be effectively cleaned by recirculating CIP solutionsat velocities of 5 ft/s or more in the largest-diameter piping in the CIPcircuit. The 5 ft/s is a general standard for CIP systems, but lowervelocities may be effective with increased circulating times, temperaturesor chemical concentrations.   Line circuits may include equipment such as pumps, colloid mills, heatexchangers, centrifuges, homogenizers and filters that are CIP-cleanable,and so able to withstand the required flows and pressures. A typicalcircuit for cleaning transfer piping connected via U-bend transfer panelsis shown in Figure 6 (bottom center)   Vessels and other large process equipment, such as basket centrifuges,dryers, conveyors, evaporators, pipes or ducts, and shell-and-tube heatexchangers are generally sprayed rather than flooded, to reduce pumpingrequirements. Figure 6 shows a typical circuit for a biotech process vessel(lower right)   The CIP solution-return system is designed to maintain a very smallpuddle of product in the bottom of a vessel, to reduce the amount ofcleaning solution required, and to prevent the ``bath tub'' deposit of soilat the liquid-air interface. Vessels can be effectively cleaned bydistributing CIP solution on the upper surfaces at flowrates of 2.0-2.5gal/min per foot of circumference for vertical domed vessels, or at 0.2-0.3gal/min per square foot of internal surface for horizontal and rectangulartanks, mixers, bins, dryers, cyclones and ductwork   In many applications, the vessel may be cleaned as part of a combinationcircuit where process piping and pumps are engineered to serve the CIPsolution supply or return function, or both (the integrated process and CIPdesign)The CIP recirculating systemsThe components of a CIP recirculating unit are typically skid-mounted on aframe, to simplify the installation of the electrical wiring, and utilityand drain connections. The units typically consist of:   A recirculation tank with supply pump, to recirculate solution to theprocess piping and equipment   A heat exchanger to heat the cleaning solution   A programmable logic controller (PLC), instrumentation and valves, tocontrol sequencing, solution flowrate and temperature, and monitorconductivity or resistivity, or both (these indicate cleaning solutionstrength and rinse water purity)   Additional auxiliary equipment, such as an eductor, automatic straineror water tanks. A strainer can be used to automatically discharge suspendedoversized solids to the drain. The strainer will discharge when thepressure drop across the strainer exceeds a pre-determined value   A chemical-feed system. Most often, chemicals are metered volumetricallyfrom drums to the cleaning system by diaphragm pumps mounted in a separatecabinet. Cleaning chemicals can also be fed from bulk-storage tanks throughmetersSelecting CIP equipmentA single-use eductor-assisted (SUEA) recirculator is shown in Figure 9.This unit has a motive pump and eductor mounted on the skid. The eductor iscapable of producing about 15 in. of vacuum, to pull returned solution backto the recirculation tank. The eductor may act alone to return thesolution, or can operate in series with a CIP return pump near the processvessel or other equipment being cleaned.   The required pumping rate for supplying solutions is determined by thesize of the transfer lines and vessels to be cleaned. Again, the optimumvelocity in lines being cleaned needs to be 5 ft/s. If a single CIPrecirculation unit is applied to clean lines and tanks, the CIPrequirements for the largest tanks will generally establish the maximumdelivery rate.   Vessels less than 5 ft in diameter require a supply of 40 gal/min; tanksof 8 to 12 ft in diameter will require 80-90 gal/min. It is desirable toclean as much of the equipment and piping as possible with a relativelysmall variation of flow. A turndown from high to low flow of more than 50%causes difficulty in properly sizing flow-control valves, heat exchangersand chemical pumps.   The CIP pump's discharge head must exceed the head loss through thelongest piping circuit, and it must supply the sprays in the largest andmost-distant tank at the required operating pressure. Since most commonlyapplied sprays operate at 25-30 psig, and the approximate head loss throughsanitary tubing is in the magnitude of 5 ft per 100 ft of length, pumpdischarge pressures are normally in the range of 50 to 80 psig, well withinthe capability of sanitary centrifugal pumps. If the CIP delivery rate isto be controlled by a flow valve, then the pump discharge head should beabout 1.2-1.3 times the maximum circuit loss (including spray supplypressure for tank CIP circuits), for effective rate control with sanitaryflow-control valves.   The recirculation tank is often as small as 60 gal. If the plant watersupply is substantially lower than the CIP pump's delivery rate, then theCIP unit must contain one or more water tanks to supply the required waterflow. A physical break or ``double block and bleed'' valve is often usedbetween the water supply and the water tanks to ensure no contamination ofthe water source. If the available water supplies permit the use of asingle recirculation tank and no water tanks, the water should be deliveredto the recirculation tank through a spray designed to rinse all the tank'supper surfaces and sidewall areas.   A shell-and-tube heat exchanger is normally part of the CIP unit. Thepre-rinse to remove most fat, carbohydrate or proteinaceous soil is carriedout with water at ambient temperature, or below 45C, to avoid ``cooking''or setting the soil on the equipment surface.   The cleaning solution is recirculated and heated with a shell-and-tubeheat exchanger, to temperatures between 55 and 80C. Hot-water sanitizingmay require delivery of water at 90C. Steam should be available insufficient capacity to heat the recirculated solution and the equipmentbeing cleaned to the desired temperature in 5-10 min, to keep cleaningtimes reasonably low.   Shell-and-tube heat exchangers must be insulated for safety reasons.But, for sanitary reasons, it is desirable to avoid insulating CIP tanks,solution lines, pumps and valves. Safety is also improved by limiting theaccess of non-essential or untrained personnel to the facilities during CIPoperation.   CIP solutions can be returned by several methods:   A CIP solution return pump can be installed near the vessel beingcleaned. Low-speed (1,750 rpm), return pumps will provide effective returnflow to the CIP recirculation unit's tank, if the return line pitchescontinuously from the tank being cleaned to the pump inlet, and if a statichead of 18-24 in. of water is available.   The pitch permits air to escape the pump and return to the tank beingcleaned. On long return lines, or on CIP return headers, an air-reliefvalve located at the pump inlet will provide improved performance. ``Selfpriming,'' sanitary return pumps will more easily handle entrained air thanconventional pumps, but they are also more expensive. High-speed (3,450rpm), return pumps have a greater tendency to become ``air bound'' thanlow-speed pumps   Gravity flow by itself will remove rinse and wash solutions from thevessel being cleaned if the tank outlet, valve and return piping issufficiently large and the static head is adequate. This method generallyrequires the CIP recirculation unit to be 12-16 ft below the outlet of thevessel being cleaned. Return piping should be pitched continuously from thevessel being cleaned to the recirculating unit   An eductor will handle both air and water, and can be used alone or witha return pump. If used alone, the head loss in the system must be limitedto the vacuum produced by the eductor, generally being in the magnitude of14-15 ft of water pressure drop.   Eductor performance may be affected by solution flashing if thetemperature is too high. Those systems that combine eductors and returnpumps (eductor-assisted CIP systems) can effectively use high-speed (3,450rpm) high-head pumps. The eductor continuously primes the high-head pump.The high-speed pump is usually less expensive than an equivalent low-speedpump, and the higher discharge head permits the use of smaller diameterreturn-side piping, of lesser volume   Top pressure may be used in place of gravity or a return pump to induceflow from a pressure-rated vessel through the return piping to therecirculating unit. A hold-back valve may be required in the return line tocontrol the weight of the cleaning solution puddle being maintained in thevessel being cleaned, and to prevent loss of top pressure by blowing thepuddle out of the vessel, except at the desired times at the end of eachmajor program stepSelecting spray devicesThere are two basic types of sprays used for CIP: static and dynamic-headsprays. Figure 10 illustrates three variations of the static sprayincluding a pumpkin-shaped ball; a tube spray with many directionallydrilled ``bubble'' spray heads; and a ``bubble'' spray. All the sprays areremovable via tri-clamp connections or slip joints for inspection andcleaning.   The balls are used in such equipment as vessels; the ``bubble'' spraysare used in ductwork and equipment where the spray device must be recessedto prevent contact with product and other special applications. The tubesprays are used in a variety of applications, such as difficult-to-reachareas or where the number of nozzles for mounting multiple balls islimited.   These sprays have found wide acceptance for permanent installations inpharmaceutical, dairy and other industries. The static sprays have beenfound to be effective and reliable cleaning devices when used incombination with properly controlled chemical cleaning programs. The spraysare sanitary, there are no moving parts, and spray performance is notaffected greatly by minor variations in supply pressure.   Dynamic head sprays produce a rotating pattern and are driven eitherelectrically or by the solution being sprayed. The sprays are notconsidered self-cleaning and sanitary because their intricate internals,such as threaded parts, bearings and seals, are difficult to clean. Dynamicsprays produce jet streams that help remove hardened soils; such impact isnot normally required in CIP, which is primarily chemical in nature.Devices to detect rotation and constant supply pressure are essential forthe sprays to perform effectively.Illustration(s):Illustration: FIGURE A.

Nevertheless, the information systemsneeded to run a complex CPI plant such as a refinery have not changed:operations management, maintenance, crisis management, warehouse,engineering, laboratory, business, and scheduling, among others.    Various control or data processing systems are currently used to managethese data needs, but computer technology and business economics areunifying these requirements into one, all-encompassing system -- theindustrial desktop computer. The industrial desktop is an evolving concept,but at this stage, several components are clear:  -- It is based on personal computers, or workstations that are compatiblewith these computers  -- It has ready access both to plant-floor data (the conventional purposeof process control computers) as well as a variety of business applicationsand telecommunications capabilities  -- It makes use of the software conventions centered around MicrosoftCorp. (Redmond, Wash.)   Engineers, plant managers and others want an industrial desktop becauseit promises to give them ready access to vital information. This iscritical not just during emergencies (when, in fact, lives are at stake)but also in the pell-mell competition to get and keep customers, to reducecosts and to improve productivity.   Many computer and automation vendors are making a concerted effort toserve this technological need. At the same time, users themselves arehelping to shape it by the demands they put on equipment and softwaredevelopers.Getting the bestThe rationale for the version of the industrial desktop comes from threesources. First, the lower cost and greater power of the latest PCs allowsworkers to handle tasks that had required large, expensive computer systemsin the recent past.   Business managers have been comfortable in equipping office workers withthis power for word processing, spreadsheets and communication. Plantengineers, however, have not enjoyed the same benefits.   They have thesame basic requirements as the office workers plus plant-related needs.   Second, current business conditions force manufacturers to make do witha minimum staff. Whether fair or not, the reality is that companies aresucceeding in carrying out their duties with drastically reduced staffing.The days when plant engineers ran plants, sales engineers sold products andexecutives ran the business are passing; now all are involved with theseactivities.   Third, the current evolution of PC software points to the dominance ofone company, Microsoft, with its various Windows operating systems, andwith a growing collection of de facto protocols or conventions in howprograms should be structured. This system is supplanting older proprietaryor Unix-based programs in industrial applications, most notably indistributed control systems. The longterm benefits of such a concentrationof, or reliance on, one company's products is debatable; what seemsindisputable is the efficiency and reliability of working today in theMicrosoft environment.Borrow from office automationThere are similarities in the industrial desktop and the office desktopinfrastructure, but there are also differences. The similarities areimportant because the industrial desktop is too small and too specializedto generate its own applications and standards. We must ``borrow''technology from the office environment or wherever it springs.   The industrial desktop works for supervisors, planners, qualitymanagers, and many others -- each with unique informational needs.  Theindustrial desktop provides a common window for all of them.   There are five considerations when constructing the industrial desktop:  -- Three-tier computing  -- Scope and definition of industrial desktop computing  -- Evolution of OLE (to be defined later) technology  -- Single window operation  -- Migration of legacy (old, obsolescent) systems   Much has been written about three-tier computing in the business world,but it is equally appropriate in industry. The philosophy, shown in Figure1, is that the best way to manage large, complex operations is to separatedata (orders, process conditions, employee records) from applications(scheduling, maintenance-management or training programs) and from thepresentation (the screen or text output).   Figure 2 is a more realistic diagram of the tiers where there areseveral applications, each with a database, each with an application layerthat presents its data and methods to the presentation layer, and parallelapplication layers. The desktop has the presentation layer and usually usesdata and methods from  parts of the application layer.  The  applicationlayer makes data accessible and updates easy  while ensuring theirintegrity.   Several methods are used to generate the application layer. The conceptsthat describe these methods are: the transaction processing monitor; storedprocedures; and objects. The transaction processing monitor performs atwo-phase routine to ensure that data, after an update, are stillconsistent. The stored procedure allows users to update via a script orprogram. The object approach hides the details of the actions from theapplications, and has advantages in the three-tier setup.   To see how three-tier computing works in a plant, consider the exampleof 24-h production, one of the most basic performance calculations. Saythere is a tank and a flow where the company needs consistent numbers forproduction. This may seem easy, but now consider the dataset. There aremany questions and ambiguities in the computation for 24-h total:  -- What flow correction is used?  -- What is the proper time stamp of the manual inputs or lab data?  -- How are missing data handled?  -- How are small negative or positive numbers handled?  -- How are redundant data used?   It is clear that people could get many different answers while computingthe 24-h total, which could be misleading. Comparable calculations areperformed in business offices on spreadsheets, but much of this isessentially unvalidated, unchecked program code handed from person toperson. This is clearly a problem in the office, but in the plant couldlead to  people or equipment in jeopardy.   The role of three-tier computing is to address squarely the methods usedto present information in a consistent fashion. This has the very desirableresult of protecting the integrity of both the data and the methods byhaving documented in only one place both the information and how it isused. As configurations or data or methods change, the application layercan implement the management of change at a single location.    Objects are a formal method for implementing the three-tierarchitecture. We can expose an interface that permits any application toask a question and get the same answer. In this example, what is needed isa real-time data object with an exposed interface for calculating the 24-haverage.   Other advantages of the three-tier architecture with objects include:  -- Avoiding the ``fat clients.'' Many applications treat the PC as if itwere the only computer, so that if other workstations need the same data ormethods, those data or methods must be duplicated in another PC. A properlynetworked system  smoothes out these burdens  -- Minimizing bad information. With all data coming from a single source,the likelihood of bad information being presented is far less and, iferrors are found, corrections are easier and need be done in only oneplace  -- Standardizing definitions of process information. Since there is onlyone definition, inconsistencies are eliminated at the source   The construction of a three-tier architecture to support the industrialdesktop is a big job. The ideal would be to have an agreement betweenvendors so that applications share objects and methods. Microsoft haslaunched a project called OPC (OLE for Process Control; CE, November 1995,p. 53) that adds real-time objects to the Microsoft OLE environment. Thisproject could accelerate  cooperation on a standard.Connecting  the desktopConsider the analysis of an oleum spill that occurred a few years ago in anurban area. The incident investigators determined that a helper, because ofabsence of a sick operator, was elevated to operator and began loading thetank car. The helper had no formal training in the loading procedures. Avent that would have prevented the gas release was not used.   The problem here was not the lack of training; it was that unplannedchanges (to accommodate an illness) and information for those making thechange did not match. The individual assigned the task did not havesufficient training, and thus did not maintain the required level ofsafety. The data were there, but lost somewhere in the plant, and notreadily available to the managers.   Most companies are in this situation, relying on people's memory andexperience. But this does not work as organizations are downsized and thesepeople leave the scene. In order to avoid this problem, the workstations ofthose scheduling or managing personnel need to have convenient access totasks, skills, procedures and equipment required in the facility.   Consider Figure 3 as a possible hardware configuration for theindustrial desktop with a few of the possible servers commonly found:  -- Local-area network (LAN) for files, printers, fax, modem, and so on  -- Plantwide information management (PIM) system, for process informationand history  -- Relational database (RDB), storing plant configurations and``warehousing'' data  -- Private branch exchange (PBX) -- a telephone network supporting voiceand some data-based communication. This may be complemented with a computertelephony server to support unified messaging for fax, e-mail, phone mailand others, remote access, call director, teleconferencing, wide-areanetworks (WANs) and an Internet interface  -- Workgroup (discussion groups, Web page, e-mail,  document database)   It is worth noting here that even organizations that do not considerthemselves at the leading edge of information technology can already havehundreds or thousands of workstations in place -- really a staggeringnumber. The surprising observation about applications for the industrialdesktop (Table) is that most of these are not on the office desktop. Theclear message is that to construct the industrial desktop for all thethousands of users is not a single project. A continuous-improvementimplementation must be used.Evolution of OLE technology``Objects,'' which have been referred to several times in the text, are thepreferred way to work with computer programs these days (CE, July 1995, p.86). An object combines data (such as a text or drawing) with instructionson how to interpret them. There are many advantages of object technologyfor developers, primarily in the reuse, rather than constant rewriting, ofcode. There are also benefits to the users:  -- Common user interface  -- Single window presentation  -- Migration of legacy systems   OLE originally meant Object Linking and Embedding, and it was only ableto house an icon  that could be clicked on to launch an application. Atthat time, the entire application that supported the object was launched inorder to use it. Later Microsoft began to develop software that allowed theprograms to be edited in place and this evolved to the OLE 2.0 - In PlaceActivation. OLE was redefined to be a generic term for the technologyimplemented with the Microsoft objects. The Microsoft definition of objectsis called COM (common object model) and DCOM (distributed COM).   OLE technology is expanding at a rapid pace with announcements fromMicrosoft. As the PC becomes part of bigger systems, OLE technologyprovides a roadmap to more complex program designs.   For forward-looking developers, OLE technology will give immediateaccess to the 32-bit capabilities of the PC and, according to Microsoft,the 64-bit VLIW (very long instruction word) technology coming with the P7.(P7 is the next generation of microprocessor, and is being designed by ajoint venture between Hewlett Packard and Intel Corp. Due in 1997, it mayuse a new design called Precision Architecture. VLIW and PrecisionArchitecture are both technologies to boost the speed of instructionprocessing.)   The  software features of a Microsoft OLE desktop that will greatlyinfluence its ``look and feel''   will be:  -- ODBC (open database connect) data access  -- Object manipulation (OLE Automation)  -- Scripting   ODBC is a nonproprietary standard supported by Microsoft and all majordatabase vendors. It is the ``calling mechanism'' for a way to interactwith databases called structured query language, or SQL.   There are two enhancements that will make ODBC the standard tool forconstructing a three-tier system on the desktop and application servers:JOIN and Stored Procedures. Microsoft added JOIN to ODBC to allow SQLqueries to use information from several different databases, local orremote. If the batch data were in a business database and production datawere in a data historian (both supporting ODBC access across the network),the PC can issue a query to do a JOIN between the two for reporting thingslike ``get average quality vs. specification WHILE Grade = Grade X over thelast month.''   The addition of Stored Procedure to ODBC will allow a user to createcustom applications. Data will be handled in a prescribed manner eventhough they are in different databases.   Object manipulation and scripting allow the interaction with the screento be ``programmed'' by the users (similar to spreadsheet macros). Thesescripts are triggered by the so-called ``OLE automation events.'' Theindustrial desktop then acts like a call center for plant personnel. If youwant to pop a window when there is a process alarm, the systems would haveto have an event created by the application software on change of state ofa variable, and then run a script (written in Visual Basic) to put thewindow on the screen -- a very common function in workstations.   Some of the companies providing software for industrial process control,including ours, are in the process of obtaining Windows 95 certification.In our case, the relevant products are  ProcessBook (a real-time database)and PI System (a desktop interface). To reach this level, work began inearly 1993, with a beta version being tested by selected customers a yearlater. A prototype of the OLE Automation version was ready in March 1995.   But this is merely the beginning of the race that industrial softwaredevelopers must run in the next several years. Consider the number ofenhancements to the desktop that must yet be implemented:  -- OLE DB--virtual data base including ODBC, JOIN, Stored Procedures  -- OPC--process control including real time data  -- Network OLE--distributed objects including security and licensemanagement  -- OLE TP--transaction processing  -- OLE Across Platforms--a joint venture with Digital Equipment Corp. fora Corba port of OLE (Corba is the Unix equivalent of OLE)  -- OLE for Enterprise--a project with Texas Instruments for objectregistry  -- OLE Office--compound documents, binders, office elements  -- WOSA--class libraries for real time access  -- TAPI--class libraries for telephony  -- CAD--class libraries for drafting  -- GIS--class libraries for geographical information systems  -- DNS--class libraries for distributed name services . . . and there are more every month.   Clearly the work will be beyond the capabilities of any one company.Those with the manpower and capital may not have the expertise and viceversa.   Component software is the answer to this situation. If a goodinfrastructure for the industrial desktop is created, and it adheresrigidly to the Microsoft standards in the form of the ``Designed forWindows 95'' logo certification program, smaller companies will be able tocreate OLE controls for the applications in the Table. Those controls canbe pasted into the industrial desktop using OLE Automation and OLE VisualBasic Scripting. All this innovation should come at a relatively low price -- probably less than $1,000 per end user.A window on the processNearly everyone using PCs today is familiar with the ``look and feel'' of acommon window environment. Each screen looks more or less the same;commands are in the same places; and different programs use many of thesame command conventions. Even when a user completely inexperienced in anew application opens a window, he or she can readily navigate through theprogram.   Windows (of all types, not just Microsoft's) have been a common featureof PCs since the late 1980s. At about the same time, the engineeringworkstation market (which has historically been based on the Unix operatingsystem) adopted the ``X Window'' protocol to provide user interfacescomparable to those of PCs.   PC users are familiar with having multiple windows open, runningdifferent applications. The situation is different in the process controlfield. As systems (each with different windowing standards) began toproliferate, it became clear that operators did not want to learn manydifferent ways to interact with a system. Some of the design parameters foroperator consoles are that operators can only learn 1.5 - 2 differentinteractive systems.   This shows the lunacy of building special screens that are not normallyused, and  that only require actions during high-stress emergencies thatwill lower both of these numbers. A better design goal is the singlewindow, but we have not always provided this. The evolution has been:  -- Multiple terminals, single room (for example, the centralized controlroom)  -- Multiple windows, single box (console furniture integration)  -- Multiple look and feel, single screen (X Window)  -- Single look and feel, single screen (Microsoft Foundation Classes)  -- Single look and feel, single screen, single interoperable applications(OLE)   The advantages of the single window are clear:  -- Cost  -- Training  -- Speed of access and familiarity in emergencies  -- Quality of applications  -- Reduced redundancy of function  -- Simplicity for developers, allowing them to concentrate onapplications   To provide a single window, there must be not only a common platform,but also a common look and feel, common support and common objectdefinition. This is the reason that the X Window convention has not beensatisfying to the users. To get the applications that they wanted (e.g.,Excel) required a different terminal.   Another weakness was the lack of a graphical user-interface standard.Two X applications do not need to have a constant look and feel or evenpermit a cut and paste between them. In some cases, such as Kanjicharacters in Japan, they do not use the same character sets and cannot seethe text from another workstation even if the cut and paste were allowed.   The Microsoft OLE Technology provides us an opportunity to build thatcommon look and feel -- essentially plagiarizing the consensus developedfor the office desktop.Migration of legacy systemsIn order to succeed, we must address squarely how to migrate the legacyapplications that exist today in a plant.   With a bit of poetic license on the spelling, we have the three R's:  -- wRap  -- Reengineer  -- Replace   With the approach proposed in PlantSuite*, this can be done as part ofan evolutionary improvement cycle and not in one, disruptive project. Tounderstand how to replace legacy systems, we have to know why they arelegacy systems in the first place. It could be one or more of thefollowing:  -- Old technology that is hard to maintain  -- Systems containing much information that cannot be shared  -- Systems having older, one- or two-tier design instead of three-tier   It may be surprising to management, but many new systems fit thesecriteria -- usually as a result of the wrong focus as the old organizationtries to perpetuate itself. The key to replacing legacy systems is to keepa focused, long-term vision to guide the short-term implementation with asystem flexible enough to accommodate the change. Today, we have anenvironment that would seem  to remain constant for the next five years:Microsoft OLE technology.   Most legacy systems of any age contain vital information used forrunning the plant, so simple replacement by new systems is not an option.In a modern system, objects are chosen (e.g., people, positions,procedures) and the methods they need to support are defined (for example:Given a person, for which tasks is he or she current?).   If these data are in a legacy system, then an interface must be writtento extract them. The key is to properly expose (or ``wrap'') the data andmethods. For example once information is obtained using OLE DB for a SQLaccess, SQL JOIN or Stored Procedure, it can be exposed to the desktopusing standard software.   Reengineering of the systems so that the methods are exposed to thedesktop is an example of three-tier design. The data buried in legacysystems can be accessed using tools to extract the methods and data to aseparate layer (another type of wrap) and then exposed to the desktop. Aseach application is completed, the number of objects should stabilize andit will become clear what are needed to support the business processes.   There are four challenges to create this design:  -- The system must be able to see information in a consistent manner fromany data source  -- It must be able to perform a JOIN between data regardless of physicallocation  -- The system must be able to execute stored procedures that may useinformation from many different data sources  -- Once the result is obtained, it must be presented to the industrialdesktop in a standard manner   This is almost precisely the description of the ODBC service in the OLEDB class libraries that are part of the Microsoft OLE Technology.   Once the wrap and reengineer are complete, replacement becomes easier.If the redesigned system is well supported, it will, by continuousimprovement, evolve into the system required by the organization. Supportis a key driving force for this change. If the only support comes frompeople who simply maintain the manuals or are interrupted at their normaljob, then there is no support. A dedicated support team is necessary.   The industrial desktop is real and is critical to business. It isintegral to the movement of information, and generation and acceleration ofan innovative environment for businesses. This can be a strategic advantagefor companies that support their plant personnel with the same automationtools as the office workers.Illustration(s):Illustration: Figure 1.

Vardy, The Foxboro CompanyEdited by Nicholas BastaTraditionally, process control has been viewed as an important subcategorywithin production management. Process lines need to be controlled to moveraw materials in and finished goods out, and the control system has evolvedto carry out this critical function reliably.   Today, however, the rapid advances in information technology are makingprocess control systems even more important to the overall performance of amanufacturer. Better software and more-powerful yet less-expensivehardware allow managers to use the control system as a competitive tool --a source of data, a means to cut costs, and a method to reduce productioncycles and meet customer timetables.   Wise application of this tool will require all the techniques taught inengineering school, along with business methods borrowed from otherdisciplines. Moreover, plant managers are finding that as controlstrategies grow more comprehensive, they are working more closely withother parts of the business -- sales and marketing executives, safety andenvironmental managers, and corporate management.Another wayThis situation makes the design and selection of control technology a morecomplex issue than simply comparing cost, capability and reliability. Adifferent method of evaluating these factors is proposed -- the DiscoveryProcess.    To make it all clear, the hypothetical example of Acme Chemical Co.,and the events that transpired at it over a year-long period, will beexamined. Acme's story, while containing bits and pieces of actual events,is fictitious.   Acme has been a good, middle-of-the-road manufacturer, with severalplants spread across the U.S. midwest and south, as well as newer plants inEurope and Asia. One of the plants, on the Gulf coast, is calledLargeAcres.   Headquarters has been downsizing to adapt to competitive realities andrealign along business units that manage the global product lines.LargeAcres has until recently avoided the downsizing due to the strength ofits product lines. Unfortunately, the market has shifted in the last 3years and the plant is already operating with less than 85% of its originalworkforce. Important workers at LargeAcres are:  -- Harry, the area manager for both Unit 4 (producing Monomer A) and -- amore recent consolidation -- Unit 5 (producing Polymer B -- Figure 1). Thecombined responsibility was a recent change in staff structure  -- The process engineer for Unit 4, Charlie, has been ill lately, yet isquite knowledgeable about the original operation. He was nearing retirementand his health problems were sometimes interfering with his duties thoughthe plant was now running pretty lean with few options for back-filling hisposition. Plant Management was weighing its options in light of thesituation.  -- Jim, the plant manager, has generally been pleased with how well hisunits had been performing, in spite of attrition due to staff cutbacks. Jimwas also mindful of an upcoming announcement that LargeAcres had to reduceits costs by 10% or risk shutting down the Polymer Unit, which in turnwould put more pressure on the Monomer Unit to find new markets or faceadditional cost pressure. Jim was in daily communication with corporateplanners.  -- Also important in the ongoing functions of Jim's plant are Jane, theR&D manager, and Kathy, the environmental, safety and health (ESH)administrator assigned to his unit. Jane had been growing increasinglyworried about the lack of consistency between the laboratory QC programsand actual data from production units. Kathy had just been brought in fromcorporate, where she wrote some of the company's new safety policies.   During a Monday staff meeting, after the production numbers werereviewed, Jim requested that Harry and other area managers begin a newprogram to evaluate instrumentation.   ``What exactly is this all about, Jim?'' asked Harry. ``We have anongoing program to repair and upgrade obsolete instrumentation as you know.We seem to get a fraction of upgrades done every year, limited mostly bybudgets and sometimes by the time available during shutdown periods.''   ``Yes, Harry, and you've done an admirable job of keeping the programgoing,'' admitted Jim. ``But corporate has noticed that the predictedsavings from new instrumentation never seem to get delivered, and that ithas been getting tougher each year for our Pilot operation to replicate ourresults here.''   ``Jim, you know as well as anyone here how often corporate falls ontheir faces when it comes to practical stuff like tying their ownshoelaces. If I have a theoretical problem for them to solve I'll be thefirst to give them a holler. We've always been able to solve our own stuffwithout their interference.''   ``I know, Harry. But times are different now. We don't have all thehorsepower we once had, and with Charlie ill and all, I just feel it's timewe figure out how to work with those corporate guys,'' said Jim. ``Let'slook at the reinstrumentation project as an opportunity for somecooperation. Give it a shot and we'll see what happens. What do you say,Harry?''   ``All right, but I sure wish things were back to the way they were, eventhough my head says that isn't possible,'' said Harry. ``We'll give it ashot.''The unexplained runawayAs tends to happen everywhere on Friday afternoons, what can go wrong does-- and at the worst time. A near-fatal accident occurs that sets in motiona process that dramatically changes how LargeAcres operates, and whatcontrol systems it uses.   That day, Harry gets a call about an unexpected, and unexplainable,incident. Apparently, an operator had opened the reactor hatch on Unit 5 totake a sample, and was almost doused with high temperature resin, whichwould have surely severely injured if not killed him. The incident wasreported immediately since it also caused some damage to the reactor andsurrounding vessels. Pressure had built up without sufficient warning andseveral safety systems, including the vent, had failed to relieve thesituation.   Harry called for an immediate meeting to start the investigation andalerted Jim. Jim decided to convene a special meeting Saturday morning ofhis staff, the Unit 5 Engineers and Lead Operators, and Kathy.   Harry didn't waste any time putting Kathy on the spot. ``Kathy, itdoesn't seem like your policy changes have kept this potentially fatalincident from occurring with one of my best operators on the second shift.What do you recommend we do now?''   Newly appointed to the ESH position, Kathy knew that she would be testedby production managers like Harry. She was also aware of the basic conflictbetween them. Production managers are concerned with maintaining operation,while corporate staff had to ensure safe operations and no corner-cutting.   ``Clearly, we need to organize an investigation team, and it has to runfast,'' she replied. She suggested several operations and engineeringpeople to fill out the team. Jim concurred.   Kathy also suggested adding representatives of the two instrumentvendors that LargeAcres used, because there seemed to be some informationgaps in the overall control strategy. Harry resisted this, saying that theteam didn't have time to analyze everything yet maintain production; hewanted to resolve safety issues quickly.   ``We need all the help we can get,'' said Jim. ``Let's do it Kathy'sway, and keep to a tight schedule.''The investigationFour weeks passed with results coming in from R&D, the local team and the investigators from the two instrument vendors, GoodData and InfoControl(InfoCon). Jane's R&D group was unable to determine the root cause of theincident. It determined that without better process data too much was leftto speculation to be certain. There was a lack of consistency in thestories from the operators and the engineers. GoodData proposed a newcontrol system to upgrade the existing one and replace the competition'shardware. InfoCon made a totally different proposal.   Michelle, the local account manager for InfoCon, had been working withHarry to help him with the routine instrumentation projects on Unit 4. Inorder to proceed, she was going to propose a ``Discovery Process'' todetermine appropriate next steps.   She explained that the process is a scoping exercise that looks at theeconomic and technical driving forces in use. It is helpful in uncoveringmissing pieces of complex engineering puzzles. These pieces reside withindividuals in the plant, and with corporate or industry benchmarks (whichcan be brought to light by the instrument vendors that may have seensimilar problems with customers), or other research.   The key is to bring all the parties together to solve the puzzles andbrainstorm practical solutions for implementation. Economics are developedfor each approach at a budgetary or near budgetary-level of detail.   Kathy and Harry sat down with the team to evaluate the options,including the proposals for reinstrumenting the plant. The proposal fromGoodData was traditional and safe, and was favored by Harry and Charlie,who had just returned from sick leave. Kathy favored the Discoveryapproach. Harry was not set against Discovery, but feared excessivedisruption to production. He frankly wanted to just ``get on with it.''After presentations from the vendors, Jim made the ``go'' decision towork with InfoCon.   Michelle explained what the process would entail: Acme and InfoCon wouldco-sponsor a 2-1/2 day meeting to explore the process that is most in needof attention. The first half-day would be used for training and settingexpectations with the team. This meeting could be followed up with othersessions to explore other problems. Now, the primary objective would be toproduce a safer operation; a secondary objective would be to reduceoperating costs.    The team needed a trained facilitator, an application engineer, aproject manager, the InfoCon account manager, relevant process and projectengineers, and the lead operators who knew the process best.   ``Let's go ahead and schedule it for the earliest convenient date,''said Jim. ``I'll help kickoff the meeting with objectives and review theresults at the end of the session.'' The meeting was scheduled for thefollowing Monday through Wednesday and it was deemed desirable to hold itoffsite at a nearby hotel. The process consisted of 12 steps:  -- 1. Map the physical process, similar to an executive flow diagram  -- 2. Superimpose the procedures commonly done by the successfuloperators  -- 3. Identify any missing pieces of information  -- 4. Identify information dependencies from the rest of the operation  -- 5. Identify best practices  -- 6. Identify major concerns -- in this case, a lack of appropriateprocess    information  -- 7. List all the identified best practices and concerns  -- 8. Brainstorm ways to overcome the concerns using a user-vendor team  -- 9. Evaluate the economics of equipment purchases, operational changesand    process cost savings  -- 10. Create next steps and assignments  -- 11. Review the exercise with management and other related processowners  -- 12. Integrate other teams' efforts   Figure 2 depicts the approach, which borrows from workflow studies andcomputer analysis. It is being treated as an adaptation to instrumentationand control concepts due to the heavy reliance on the information flows intoday's operations. The gap created by this process is the driving forcebetween existing operations and the desired state of a future view.   The multi-step implementation plan is a practical scheme for closing thegap in a timely and cost-effective manner. Each of the steps is analyzed,and costs and benefits are reestablished during implementation. In otherwords, lessons learned from the first step of implementation are used toevaluate the next step as the process continues through to finaldevelopment.   As the team, led by the facilitator, went through the steps of theprocess, a number of surprising conclusions surfaced. Most significantly,the full team uncovered process conditions that could lead to safetyproblems. Although process-safety meetings had been running more or lesscontinuously for years, the problem had not been revealed. The previousevaluations had focused primarily on known data, conditions and procedures,and not on unknown or unforeseen conditions.   Another surprising result was that a whole host of long-term or vaguelyunderstood corporate goals were found to be of vital importance in how theproject was scoped out. For example, it was known that corporate managementwas in a multi-year program to switch to a new type of business software,which would require different types of operating systems and communicationlinks. But no one figured that these changes would affect productionmanagement anytime soon, and therefore they had been ignored. Now, inanalyzing the interconnection of the future business and control software,the team realized that not only did they have a fast track to implementingthe expected changes, they also had a powerful incentive to offermanagement to justify the capital expenditure.Presenting the resultsWhen the Acme team members were ready to present their findings to Jim,they made a list of the potential benefits of a revamped control system.These would form the basis of recommended capital expenditures and servicesif their plans were accepted:  -- 1. A top-to-bottom review of operating procedures showed whereexisting data was insufficient to plan procedures. An upgraded system wouldbe able to generate these data  -- 2. The consequences of changing raw-material supplies were worked out.When impurity levels change, the reaction speed is dramatically affected,and side reactions occur. New instrumentation, and a data link between Jane's R&D laboratory and the production units, correct this situation  -- 3. Document management, involving both the laboratory and theproduction unit, could be upgraded by having a real-time link. Whenimpurity levels change, the system would be able to provide access tostored laboratory data and documents for safety purposes  -- 4. A long-term corporate goal of switching to another type of businesssoftware, running on a different operating system, could be addressed.Previously, the managers had expected that they would be the last to beaffected by the switchover; now they were in a position to be the firstproduction unit to take advantage of the software  -- 5. Another production engineering goal, to consider the impact of newindustry data-communication standards, was shown to be a significant factorin rationalizing the control strategies and updating control software. Inparticular, the contents of the SP88 standard (CE, October 1995, p. 118)would provide better management of batch recipes.   ``We have been operating in LargeAcres in somewhat of a fog these lastfew years,'' said Harry, in his concluding presentation. ``Our safetymis-hap has opened the door to taking a fresh look at these topics.''Six months laterIn reviewing the records of plant operations since the accident, Jim foundmany benefits, some of them not predicted. Customers are pleased that Acmecan meet its product schedules and changes. With the new batch managementsoftware, control of inventory is enhanced, demurrage charges (for tankcarsheld in storage) was reduced, and energy consumption was down.   As Jim thought about all the improvements that he was seeing in plantoperations, he realized that the source was partly new technology --especially the standardized, open software that allows better communicationamong control and management systems, and partly a new way of analyzingplant conditions that emerged during the Discovery Process. Because theProcess revealed new steps between ``things as they are'' and ``things asthey should be,'' Acme was able to take a leap forward in automationtechnology, rather than the piecemeal approach of the past.Illustration(s):Illustration: FIGURE 1.

However, pipe connections can be expensive toinstall and may create crevices or ridges inside the pipe, which canthreaten sanitary conditions, or increase maintenance between batches.   And, unless properly installed, many pipe connections offer potentialpathways for valuable, hazardous or toxic fluids to escape. During theinstallation of flanged connections, flanges are typically bolted togetheruntil a seasoned mechanic feels the connection is ``tight enough.'' Somemechanics may use a torque wrench to ensure correct, uniform bolttightness. ``Bolted, flanged joints are always based on a specified boltload,'' says George Sturdevant, President of Houston-based Fastorq BoltingSystems, Inc. ``But, what is often missing in the specification is how thatbolt load is to be achieved, and how the joint is to be inspected.''   While a torque wrench is helpful in achieving the proper bolt loading,the relationship between torque and bolt load is often poorly understood,as it is a function of several hard-to-measure flange and boltcharacteristics, including friction, fit, finish, and lubricity. To avoidflange leakage due to incorrect bolt loading, many joints include largesafety factors.   Welding, although labor intensive, is often the least expensive way tojoin pipes, but it creates permanent connections that need to be cut if thepipe must be entered later. Where welded connections are desired, the useof automatic welding machines is on the rise, says David Dodge, amarketing manager at Dimetrics, Inc. (Davidson, N.C.), particularly in thefood, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries. ``Automatic weldingmachines produce a smooth, flush internal bead, which eliminates creviceswhere contamination could collect,'' he adds.   In addition to producing welds of consistent quality at faster speedsthan manual welding, these machines provide a permanent record of theoperating conditions that took place when each weld was made. However, thecost and setup time required to use automatic welding may limit its use.   ``Manual welding is still often the most cost-effective method,'' saysSteve Burkel, President of Applied Energy Systems (Malvern, Pa.). As a ruleof thumb, he suggests that for pipe diameters up to about 8 in., about 10or more identical welds would have to be performed for the automaticwelding machine to be more cost-effective. ``But for large, heavy-walledpipe, or where clearance is restricted, or where an excess heat input isrequired to control stress crack corrosion at the weld, automatic weldingmay be appropriate for a single weld.''Adding layers of protectionIn recent years, the use of plastic-lined pipe has grown among processoperators. Many vendors have introduced bent piping systems that requirefewer flanged connections. Firms announcing recent product improvementsinclude Dow Plastic-Lined Piping Products (Bay City, Mich.), CraneResistoflex (Marion, N.C.) and Houston-based Performance Plastic Products(see Removing joints from plastic-lined pipe, CE, November 1995, pp.37-41).   To join such systems, special plastic-lined flanges are bolted together.With the launch of its new Conquest product line last month, DowPlastic-Lined Piping Products introduced a system that relies on mechanicalcouplings instead of flanged connnections. These mechanical couplings canbe made in the field, and provide permanent connections that eliminateleakage paths, and reduce ongoing maintenance.   A variety of piping products are described below. These include linedpipe systems, plastic tubing, high-alloy pipe for highly aggressive andhigh-temperature applications, and a variety of accessories, includingquick-connects, seals for pressure testing and line isolation, andexpansion joints.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. CORROSION: PREVENTION AND PROTECTIONNew materials and new monitors battle equipment decayThe experienced corrosion engineer knows that corrosion tables fromhandbooks and manufacturer's literature should be used for screening, notselection. The data presented in those tables cannot possibly consider allthe process conditions that can influence corrosion rates.    Actual performance of metals in corrosive service can often surprisethe most experienced corrosion specialist. Trace impurities (for example,halogens) can produce corrosion rates substantially above the predictionsof corrosion charts and handbooks. Process upsets can also create briefperiods of composition changes that produce excessive corrosion rates.   Erosion can also enhance corrosion. Many alloy metals rely on a passiveoxide coating to protect the base metal. If this coating is continuallyeroded away by an abrasive slurry, a metal that would be virtuallycorrosion free in a clean solution can corrode very rapidly.   To prevent the unexpected corrosion failure of process equipment and totest the performance of possible alternative alloys, many chemical plantsare monitoring actual process corrosion rates. ``Corrosion monitoring toolsrange from very simple test coupons to very sophisticated instruments withfeedback controls,'' explains Dennis Pritchard, a vice president at MetalSamples Co. (Munford, Ala.)   Monitoring corrosion with test coupons consists of placing a small waferof the metal in the process stream and removing it periodically to checkfor weight loss. These coupons can be inserted through a double valvesystem, so the process need not be shut down to inspect the coupons. Formore frequent readings of corrosion rate, an electrical conductivity probecan be installed in the process. Constructed of the metal being tested, theprobe gradually loses metal as corrosion proceeds. The drop in electricalconductivity is directly related to corrosion rate.   ``Conductivity probes can be highly sophisticated,'' notes Pritchard.``They can provide a continuous readout of corrosion rate which, whencoupled with other process variables such as pH and temperature, allow theengineer to determine how a metal fares under changing operatingconditions.'' He also notes that conductivity probes are often used as theindependent variable in control loops to adjust pH or add corrosioninhibitors.Redundant tests add flexibilityWhile corrosion coupons are generally considered more reliable thanconductivity probes, Jim Tauscher, a technician at Tennessee Eastman Div.,Eastman Chemical Co. (Kingsport, Tenn.) finds the probes provide more rapidindication of potential problems. ``We install coupons and conductivityprobes together in the process stream,'' he explains. ``When the probesignals high metal loss, we check metal thickness of the vessel or pipe.Usually, the probe predicts actual metal loss quite well.''   Two additional tips come from Tauscher's experience. First, he findsthat laboratory tests of corrosion rates aren't nearly as reliable as usingin-process test coupons or conductivity probes. And second, he finds thatcontinuous recordings of corrosion rates often uncover upstream processupsets that may otherwise go undetected.   Alloy availability is often overlooked when studying alloy performance.As Alan Gamble, president of Alloy Tech Inc. (Salem, N.H.), notes, ``Of allthe different alloys and shapes that can be made, few are actuallyavailable from distributors. Unless you're willing to buy a large quantitydirectly from the mill, and wait for the mill to make it, testing shouldonly be done on materials that you know meet your availabilityrequirements.''   Some corrosive applications, such as acidic fluegases, lend themselvesto highly specific corrosion monitors. Designed to identify conditions thatcreate acidic condensation on the walls of the stack, the monitors canprovide data that help optimize combustion and heat utilization whileprotecting the flue ducts.    While a metal or metal alloy can usually be found that will handle acorrosive application, plastic should also be considered when the pressureand temperature are moderate. Plastic can often cost less, and provide lesspotential for contaminating the process with corrosion products. This isespecially true for containment applications.   The items below include plastic equipment, linings and coatings -- usingboth thermoplastic and thermoset resins -- designed for aggressiveenvironments.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. WITHSTAND CORROSIVES, HIGH TEMPERATURES WITH CPVC PIPINGCorzan X10 pipe and fittings are the latest addition to this firm's productline, which includes valves, pumps, strainers, ducting and industrial sheetmade from chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC).

Dhole, Nand Ramchandani, Richard A. Tainsh, and Marek WasilewskiLinnhoff March Ltd.Edited by Nicholas P. ChopeyEnvironmental protection, rising costs for wastewater-treatment, and atmany sites a shortage of fresh water are all persuasive motives forreducing raw water consumption and wastewater discharge at achemical-process plant. Maximizing the re-use of water within the plant canbe of great help. Systematic strategies for such maximization can lowerfreshwater usage and wastewater discharges by 50% or more, while alsosignificantly reducing capital investment in treatment facilities.   The typical base case or starting point for such improvements appears inFigure 1, which shows a conventional water network in a process plant.After undergoing initial treatment, the incoming water goes in parallelstreams to the various individual process units, as well as to the utilitysystem for steam production and for use in cooling towers. Wastewaterstreams from the processes, along with blowdown and condensate losses fromthe utility system, are usually collected together and the combined streamfed to a wastewater treatment facility prior to discharge.The options availableThere are two basic strategies for reducing water demand in such a plant.One strategy consists of modifying individual process and utility units toreduce their inherent need for water. Examples include replacing watercooling with air cooling, improving controls of boiler and cooling-towerblowdowns, and increasing the number of stages in an extraction unit thatemploys water as its extractant.   In the other basic strategy, which is the main focus of this article,the engineer seeks opportunities to use the outlet water from one operationto satisfy the water requirement of another or the same operation. In somecases, the water may require some regeneration prior to re-use. Examples ofregeneration include pH adjustment, filtration, membrane separation,sour-water stripping and ion exchange.   Unfortunately, such attempts to lower freshwater use and wastewatergeneration are usually carried out piecemeal: Designs of individual unitsare improved and water-reuse opportunities acted upon without consideringthe overall plant as a whole. Now, however, newer approaches are availablein which all of the plant's process and utility units can be systematicallytreated as one entity [2,3,4].Early focus on mass transferAll such systematic approaches known to us include elements of pinchtechnology [1]. Increasingly used in the process industries since the early1980s, the initial embodiment of pinch technology offers a way to solvecomplex multi-stream heat integration problems by converting stream datainto a visual representation on temperature and enthalpy axes. As there areparallels between heat transfer and mass transfer, the establishedprinciples of thermal pinch analysis can be extended to fresh- andwastewater minimization.   The first moves in that direction came in 1989, when El-Halwagi andManousiouthakis at the University of California, Los Angeles [2] addresseda more general problem of mass exchange between a set of rich processstreams and a set of lean streams. Five years later, Wang and Smith at theUniversity of Manchester [England] Institute of Science and Technology [3]specifically addressed the water-minimization problem, by considering it asa contamination-transfer problem from process streams to water streams.   Both of these approaches are based on the model of a process unit as amass-transfer unit (Figure 2): Contaminant moves from the rich processstream to the water stream. The mass- transfer driving force is indicatedby the gap between the process and water stream profiles plotted onconcentration and mass-transferred axes.   Focus your attention for a moment on the Wang and Smith approach.Although space limitations do not permit a usable, step-by-stepexplanation, the first task consists of developing a limiting water profilefor each water-using process operation, based on maximum inlet and outletconcentrations for the water stream for each operation.   The limiting water-stream concentrations of all the process units arecombined together to construct the limiting composite curve for the overallplant. A fresh-water line is then constructed, and matched against thelimiting composite curve to set the minimum fresh-water demand for theoverall plant (Figure 3a).   The minimum-fresh-water line touches the limiting composite curve at twopoints: at zero concentration and at an intermediate position called thepinch point. This line, which corresponds to the minimum water flowraterequired for the plant, establishes the ``target'' for maximizing waterre-use. The limiting composite curve construction also shows criticalsections of the plant (regions close to pinch concentration) that requireespecially close attention in order to achieve the minimum waterrequirement.   To develop the water-reuse network that minimizes the fresh-waterdemand, the Wang and Smith approach uses network-design methodologyanalogous to the pinch design method from heat integration. The initialnetwork thus obtained tends to have a complex structure, but anevolutionary procedure then simplifies this to yield a practical network(Figure 3b).   Unfortunately, the sequence as just described deals with only onecontaminant. Accounting for multiple contaminants requires more-complexconstruction of limiting composite curves, as well as more-involved networkdesign [3].   Another drawback to the approach is its use of contaminant mass transferas the basis for modeling. Many process units, such as reactors, boilersand cooling towers, cannot readily be described as contaminant masstransfer units.   Furthermore, it is difficult to model situations, not uncommon inprocess plants, in which several water-based streams enter and leave theprocess unit at different concentrations. And, the approach does notdirectly address practical constraints such as geographical distances (longpipe runs) and other constraints that may forbid re-use of water from oneunit to another.   In spite of these practical problems, the Wang and Smith approach hasserved as the pioneering tool for water minimization. We ourselves haveemployed it on projects of this type. Furthermore, that experience gave usthe basis for developing a newer approach for wastewater minimization thatovercomes the problems outlined above.Two composite plotsIn this approach, each relevant process or utility operation within theoverall plant is considered as having aqueous input and output streams.There can be several of each, at different purities, in a single operation.The approach involves a combination of new graphical and mathematicaltechniques, and is trademarked WaterPinch.   The graphical procedure is analogous to the familiar method from pinchtechnology [1]. The engineer can plot the input aqueous streams of allrelevant operations into a combined ``demand composite'' form, on a graphhaving purity as its vertical axis and aqueous-stream flowrate as itshorizontal axis. This composite defines the water demands, in terms ofrequired input purities for the individual streams, for the overall plant.Similarly the output water streams of all the operations can be plotted toconstruct the ``source composite'' for the plant, defined in terms of theminimum output purities of the individual streams.   An example for a plant having five process units appears in Figure 4.Note that the numbers on the vertical axis increase downward, not upward --that is, purity is measured in terms of the amount of contaminationpresent, with the zero-contamination point (i.e., the highest purity)occupying the highest point on the vertical axis and the concentrationnumbers representing successively greater contamination descending alongthe scale. Note also that the supply and demand composites are overlappeduntil they just avoid a crossover, and thus define the ``pinch point''between the two composites.   As an example of how the individual line segments of the composites areplotted, consider first Segment A on the water-sources composite. Itrepresents a stream leaving Process Unit A whose flowrate is 43 tons/h (asshown by its length, i.e., 130 2 87 measured against the horizontal axis)and whose contaminant level is 70 ppm (as measured against the verticalaxis). Similarly, Segment B represents a stream of 48 tons/h (178 2 130against the horizontal axis) leaving Process Unit B, with a contaminantlevel of 47 ppm. As for Segment C on the water-demands composite, itrepresents Process Unit C's requirement for 106 tons/h (238 2 132) of waterwhose contaminant level is no higher than 65 ppm.   The overlap between the source and the demand composite, shown by theshaded area, indicates the potentialities for water reuse. The availableoverlap is limited by the pinch point. The representation in Figure 4 alsoidentifies targets for minimum fresh water demand and wastewatergeneration.   The pinch point and the composite curves help to identify designimprovements in an existing plant. In the first place, the sources shouldprovide water to demands on the same side of the pinch. Flow of water froma source above the pinch to a demand below the pinch will increase theconsumption beyond the target. Using fresh water to satisfy demands belowthe pinch, or sending water from sources above the pinch to wastetreatment, will have the same effect.   The representation also helps the engineer identify design modificationsthat can further improve the targets for a plant. Figure 5 shows anexample. By mixing Streams A and B described in Figure 4, we can generate a91-ton/h stream of intermediate purity (58 ppm), shown as ``Mix'' in Figure5a. Because this stream is pure enough to satisfy part of the Segment Cdemand for 106 tons/h of 65-ppm (or purer) water, the pinch-pointbottleneck shown in Figure 4 is relieved, allowing further overlap of thesource and demand composites and increasing the overall water recovery inthe process.   The diagram also provides specific design guidelines to maximize there-use of water, as shown in Figure 5b. For example, it indicates that thewater mixture from outlets of units A and B needs to supply water to unitC, and that the remaining water demand for unit C can be satisfied by partof the water outlet from unit D.   The visual representation typified by Figures 4 and 5 can also bepresented and manipulated via an equivalent mathematical model. The modelenables the user to deal with complex water networks, having multiplecontaminants and large number of process operations. For such problems theuser may find it easier to start with the mathematical model and thenvisualize the simplified solutions.   Use of the model also lets the engineer take into account certainpractical issues for which the visual representation would be irrelevant.Examples include geographical and operability constraints, and varyingcosts of fresh waters and of wastewater treatment.   The mathematical model is completely compatible with the visualrepresentation: The user can switch between mathematical and visual modesat any stage. The two are also complementary, the visual tool improvingengineering understanding and the mathematical model allowing the handlingof complex problems.Illustration(s):Illustration: FIGURE 1.: The typical process plant offers considerablescope for water conservation and waste minimizationDAVID WHITCHERIllustration: FIGURE 2 (left).

Up to now, effluents from seven process plants at the complex have beencollected together, and the resulting mixture adjusted for pH and thendischarged along an outflow into the River Severn estuary. Recently, theU.K.'s National Rivers Authority indicated that the resulting dischargelevels are not acceptable in the long term. Accordingly, Monsanto decidedto reduce discharged COD by 90%. Doing so via a conventional, centralizedtreatment system would have required capital outlays of $15 million.   However, applying the WaterPinch approach has revealed that the site'sfresh-water consumption could be cut by 30%. The resulting decrease ineffluent volume significantly lowers the required size of the treatmentfacility. What's more, process changes suggested by the water-minimizationstudy reduce the COD load by 76%.   As a result, the required capital expenditure has shrunk to $3.5million. Additional benefits include a savings of $300,000/yr infresh-water cost and $700,000/yr in raw materials that would have been lost in the effluent from the larger treatment plant.

Janas, Pall Corp.Edited by Deborah HairstonThe filtration spectrum spans a broad range of contaminant types andparticle sizes that can be selectively removed from a fluid or gas via aporous medium [1]. Within this domain, several separation processes areavailable, from reverse osmosis to particle filtration (Table 1).   At the top of the spectrum is the ionic range -- where hyperfiltrationtechniques are used for removal of particles smaller than 0.001 m. Anexample is reverse osmosis, a membrane diffusion process. In this process,pressure is applied to solutions of low-molecular-weight solutes in contactwith a membrane. By use of solution-diffusion mechanisms, a solution lowerin solute concentration is produced.   To remove higher-mass particles, coarser particles in the molecularrange, ultrafiltration is specified. Ultrafilters, which clarify colloidsin the range of 0.002-0.02 m, are used. While reverse osmosis requirespressure up to 600 psi, ultrafilters operate with pressure on the order of50 psi.   Microfiltration and particle filtration, for clarification ofcontaminants in the range of 0.01-120 m, can be accomplished withdisposable filter elements, which are designed as bag or cartridgeconfigurations. This article focuses on the selection of disposablecartridge filters. Less expensive and more convenient than cleanablefilters, cartridge filters should be carefully matched with the productbeing filtered to achieve the desired results. Specifying the optimumfilter will help meet product specifications and potentially avoid futureprocessing problems.   Cartridge filters typically consists of a porous medium, in a pleated ordepth style, supported by a core. Many standard filters are built inmultiple lengths of 10 in., with an outside dia. of 2.5 or 2.75 in. Adepth-style cartridge has a thick, continuous filter medium that may be:  -- String wound. Typically does not have a fixed pore structure and mayrelease contaminants under differential pressure load  -- Molded fiber. Has a fixed pore structure, is flow resistant, andcompared with other styles of depth filters, may have a lower service life  -- High-efficiency depth filter. Typically has a fixed-pore structure,possesses a continuously graded prefilter layer and constant-pore diametersection, features uniform compressibility and density, high voids volume,and typically has a long service life   A pleated-style cartridge features a filter medium that is folded intopleats that may be:  -- Triangular-shaped. Geometrically fold-ed sheets of medium  -- Crescent-shaped. Slightly curved to provide the advantages of bothtriangular-pleated and high-efficiency depth-style media   When, as is typical, the particle concentration is low -- less than 100ppm or 0.01% by weight -- a depth-type cartridge filter is used to trap thecontaminants. At higher concentrations, the filtration mechanism of bulksolids removal by cake filtration, may operate. At these higher loadings,the solids can form a cake on the surface of the filter medium. Use ofbackwashable fixed-pore depth media, metal filters, or a finer-rated,fixed-pore medium with a large pleated surface area, may be appropriate.   While there is no sharp dividing line for choosing any one type ofdisposable filter over another, there are several variables that should beconsidered in the selection of the optimum filter for a given application:  -- Nature of the fluid. Compatibility, viscosity, hazard class, value  -- Process conditions. Flow rate, density, temperature, pressure drop,batch or continuous process  -- Type of solid contaminants. Shape, quantity, structure and size, todetermine the degree of filtration required   Any combination of these factors can determine the final selection offilter configuration. The purchase price for cartridge filters, along withthe frequency of filter changeout and effluent quality, must be weighedagainst the labor, disposal and downtime costs. Once the benchmark criteriaare established, the benefits should exceed the investment cost of thefilter and its use.Nature of the fluidAs a rule of thumb, any filter component, including the medium, hardware,housing, O-rings and gaskets, that come in contact with a chemical beingfiltered should be compatible with that fluid at operating conditions. Asoak test can verify compatibility once the fluids class -- acid, alkali,aqueous, oil or solvent -- and percent composition are identified. There isa broad array of filter materials to consider, among them cellulose, fiberglass, polypropylene, nylon, cellulose esters, fluorinated polymers andaramides.   Viscosity, the resistance of a fluid to the motion of its molecules, isa measure of the ability of a fluid to flow. The lower the viscosity, thefaster the fluid will flow at a given driving force. (Water has a viscosityof one cP at 20C.) Because viscosity directly affects the pressure dropacross a set of filters, pleated cartridges and bag filters, with theirlarger surface areas to reduce resistance to fluid flow, should beconsidered for fluids with a viscosity typically greater than 50 cP.   Under extreme pressure differentials, there is a potential risk ofcollapse for some triangular-pleat constructions. If compatible, use of thecrescent-shaped pleated-style cartridge is also recommended and may bepreferable for some of these applications. The effect of fluid flow is evenmore pronounced for applications that require filters rated 20-m absoluteand finer.   If a spent cartridge contains hazardous waste, then a pleated cartridge,a configuration that can pack more filter area into a given volume thanthat of either a bag or depth filter, may be the optimum choice. The filterlife is longer, and there are fewer filters to remove from the housing anddiscard.   Bag filters, which consist of a porous medium shaped in a bag- orsock-like structure, are a second choice. Some standard sizes are 4 in.dia., with lengths of 9 and 15 in., and 7 in. dia., with lengths of 17 and33 in.   Although more bags are required to match the service life of pleatedelements, bags may be tightly compacted for disposal.   If the process fluid is considered expensive, pleated cartridges, may bethe best choice. Pleated elements retain less fluid than do either bagfilters or depth cartridges.Process conditionsPleated cartridges are often the optimum choice when long service life isrequired. At fine ratings, flow resistance is lower than that of either abag or depth filter due to increased surface area. Consequently a smaller,less expensive housing will suffice for a pleated configuration. Forflow-rates of 250 gal/min or greater, in applications requiring 20-mabsolute or finer filtration, a pleated cartridge may be the best choice.   It is important to monitor the temperature of a process. Some disposablemedia or hardware cannot withstand prolonged exposure to high temperatures.For high-temperature service above 250F, filters made of metal or ceramicmay be preferred.   The life of a disposable filter is determined by the service conditionsand actual filter construction. Filter life may relate to its dirtcapacity. A large void volume, or open area of a medium, increases the lifeof a filter and affords a lower, clean pressure drop. The life of mostfilters is greatly increased as flow density is decreased [2]. Therelationship comparing service life (t = filter life in minutes, hours ordays) to flow density [J = flow density in gal/(min)(ft2)] is given by thefollowing:  -- t2 = t1 (J1/J2)n where n = extension factor (dimensionless), 1 and 2refer to the trials.   The life extension factor (n) is experimentally determined and has avalue such that: 1 n 2 (Figure 1). Filter life of a chosen configurationof filters is increased substantially by reducing the flow density to theelements. The life extension factor will approach two if:  1. Filter cake is not compressible  2. Collected cake does not filter finer than the filter  3. Solids collected are of a uniform diameter   Therefore, it is generally more economical to install more filters for agiven flow rate. However, it is advisable to perform a cost-benefitanalysis. As stated previously, filtration benefits must equal or exceedthe investment and operating costs of the filter before a selection ismade.   Total pressure drop, developed across the filter housing, is comprisedof resistance to flow through the piping, the filter's hardware and thefilter medium. The finer the filter rating, the smaller the diameter of themedium's pores for nondepth-type filters, and the greater the resistance tothe fluid flow, resulting in higher differential pressure. In the selectionof a disposable filter assembly, there must be sufficient pressure toovercome the initial resistance to flow and to maintain flow as the filtermedium plugs.   Filter life is enhanced by properly sizing the cartridge to achieve alow initial clean differential pressure (typically sized at <5 psid). Oncethe knee of the characteristic curve of pressure drop versus time forconstant flow is reached, the differential pressure across the filter risesrapidly (Figure 2). Disposable cartridges and bag filters can generallywithstand 60-80 psid in the forward direction before they begin to failstructurally. For higher differential pressures, metal filters are theconstruction of choice.   For continuous filtration applications, where long service life isdesired, pleated cartridges are often the optimum choice. Their highsurface areas provide longer service life. For batch filtration operations,or when filters are changed out after use to avoid cross contamination, adepth filter may be the optimum choice to fully utilize the life of thefilter before changeout. Furthermore, when filters are changed outbatch-to-batch, the lower-cost depth filter may be the optimum choice.Types of solid contaminantsTo define the effective size of thecontaminant and to determine the de-gree of filtration required, the filterremoval efficiency is a convenient tool. Filters for the chemical processindustries are typically rated by the ``challenge'' system, wherein afilter is challenged by pumping through it a suspension of a readilyrecognized contaminant, such as glass beads, or siliceous or bacterialsuspensions.   To determine the maximum particle size and assign a removal rating tothe filter, the filtrate is examined for the presence or absence of thetest contaminant downstream. The absolute rating is defined as the removalof contaminants greater than the size specified. String-wound depth filtersare typically unable to achieve an absolute rating because they do not havea fixed-pore construction.   Along with the maximum particle size test, the gravimetric efficiencytest is derived from military specifications. The weight of feedcontaminant to effluent contaminant is determined, and the filterefficiency rating is assigned.   The Beta Ratio is the most informative and useful method to express afilter's removal efficiency and performance over its service life. The testprotocol is an adaption of Oklahoma State University's F-2 filterperformance test [3], modified for the rapid semiautomatic testing offilters with aqueous fluids in a single pass mode [4]. Using continuousonline particle counters set at several particle sizes, both upstream anddownstream of the test filter, the counts are recorded throughout the lifeof the filter (Figure 3). The Beta Ratio, at a specific particle size (x)is defined as:(This formular is not available elctronically. Please see January 1996,issue.)   Whereas Bx = 1 represents 0% efficiency at size x, Bx = 2 represents 50%efficiency at size x, and Bx = 10 represents 90% efficiency, Bx = 5,000represents 99.8% efficiency at size x, and is typically called the absoluterating. By tabulating the Beta Ratio values of different filters, theconfiguration of a filter can be selected that meets the requirements of agiven application (Figure 4).   If the process contaminants are gelatinous, a depth-style filter may bethe optimum choice, as gels are trapped in the filter medium where theycould possibly deform and extrude through a pleated or bag filter that isthinner. If the contaminants form a porous cake, or if the solids loadingis on the high side, a bag filter may be the best choice for theapplication.Cost considerationsThe selection of a filter for a specific application depends on the natureof the fluid, the process conditions, and the type of contaminants. Becauseany combination of these factors can determine the final selection,knowledge of these factors and a careful review of specifications withfilter vendors are essential to making the right choice. When per-elementcost is the primary issue, the depth filter is the first choice.   Low initial cost must balance frequency of filter changeout -- withoutits labor, disposal and downtime cost -- to get a total cost of ownershipvalue (Table 2). But ultimately, the selected filter must meet allcriteria, as specified by the customer, and provide an economically viablesolution to the filtration application.         TABLE 1.

Unfortunately, these efforts can'tguarantee that you'll reap all the benefits of your work. Often, you mayneed to take another step to protect your invention -- applying for apatent.   If you think your invention is patentable, act quickly to get necessarylegal processes started right away. In the meantime, don't discuss or shareyour work with anyone outside your company.   This article covers U.S. patents. For information on non-U.S. patents,try multinational organizations, such as the European Patent Office (box,p. 118). Whatever intellectual-property protection you're considering,always check with a patent attorney.Prepare the groundworkFirst, you'll need to determine if your work can be patented. Talk to apatent attorney to discuss the possibilities.   People often want to skip the essential step of conducting a patentsearch. Anxious to have his or her work protected, an engineer might say,``File the application now; we'll worry about patentability later.''Although this approach succeeds on rare occasions, it's often dangerous toskip the search. You might file an application that infringes on someoneelse's patent.   A crucial step in the patenting process is the search. Don't make themistake of thinking that your invention can be patented if it hasn't yetappeared in a journal or in the marketplace. Browsing through chemicalabstracts or the shelves of local variety stores does not constitute apatentability search. You'll need to thoroughly comb U.S. and foreignpatents.   Although many engineers know they'll need a lawyer later on to draft apatent application, few understand how important it is to use an attorneyfor their search. The costs of determining patentability are a fraction ofthose you'd spend on drafting and filing a patent application.   For instance, if you chose to conduct a search on your own, you mightnot conduct it thoroughly. And you might find that someone's alreadypatented the invention you thought was original -- only after you've hiredan attorney at considerable expense to file your patent application.   The more you know about existing patents, the better you're equipped toprotect your invention. A well-conducted search enables you to accuratelyjudge how you should define the claims of your patent. The way you presentyour application determines the scope of protection your work willreceive.   For example, if your process can be slightly modified to work in anumber of different industries, your search may reveal that none of thesevariants have been patented -- and so you can claim all of them in yourapplication. But if you describe only the basic process in the application,other people may later be able to patent the variants. (For more-detailedinformation about what to claim in a patent, see CE, September 1993, p.120.)   If your search determines that your invention is indeed patentable, youmust decide whether to apply for a patent or keep your work a trade secret(box, p. 118). Basically, a patent gives you the exclusive right topractice your invention for no more than 20 years from the date you filethe patent application; by contrast, trade-secret status means that youmay be able to keep your invention out of the public domain indefinitely.No matter what, mum's the wordIf you decide to apply for a patent, don't talk about or disclose yourinvention to anyone outside your organization until after the applicationis filed in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO; Washington, D.C.).Inadvertent disclosure of your work to a third party can ruin yourcompany's foreign and U.S. marketing plans for the invention.   In most non-U.S. countries, you lose your right to patent if youdisclose your invention before filing. In the U.S., however, you can filefor up to one year after the date of first disclosure. However, it'sadvisable not to disclose your invention under most circumstances.   For example, if you talk to someone about your invention before filing,that person might try to patent your invention. This frequently happenswhen an inventor collaborates with someone (a ``third party'') on part ofthe research. The third party then files a separate application, thinkingthat he or she, not the named inventor, is the actual inventor of theidea.   In such a case, what generally happens is that the USPTO declares aconflict, or ``interference,'' between the applicants. No matter what thefinal outcome, one result is inevitable: sky-high legal fees for the namedinventor.Document your effortsYou can lose your right to a patent if you haven't maintained appropriaterecords of your work. While the patent application is pending, you mayneed to produce records that document two dates:  -- Conception date. This is the point at which a coworker could take overthe invention, continuing to work on it without making an additionalinvention  -- Reduction-to-practice date. The invention was actually completed bythis date, and must have been shown to accomplish its intended purpose   The documentation chronicling these dates can also be vital in laterlitigation. For example, you'll need these records in case of laterinterference.About the Author(s):John Wilson Jones, a partner with Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoonL.L.P.

A U.S. patent, on the other hand, allows you to preventothers from practicing (using, making or selling) your invention. UntilJune 1994, the patent term was 17 years from the date the patent wasgranted; now it is 20 years from the application-filing date.   In order to obtain a patent, you must fully disclose your work. Not onlymust you clearly explain all embodiments of the invention (e.g., variants)-- you must also set forth the best mode of operating the invention. Youcannot receive a patent on an idea while simultaneously shielding importantaspects of the invention. You cannot, for instance, obtain a patent on anew detergent without disclosing the preferred ratios of components of thedetergent and how it is made.   In typical circumstances, your company will most want to patent thoseaspects of your invention that can be most easily analyzed, or ``backengineered.'' For instance, if your detergent is easily analyzed, you'llprobably want to patent the composition.   At the same time, you want to patent those aspects of your inventionthat you consider the most important. For example, if the crux of your workis a new process for preparing detergent (rather than the composition), youmay choose to patent the process, and not the composition.   Another factor to consider, when you're deciding whether or not topatent, is the likelihood that a competitor could independently invent thesame thing. If you invent a process that you decide to make a trade secret(rather than patenting), and your competitor Company X comes up with thesame process, Company X may file for and receive a patent. In this case,you'd be barred from using your own invention for the 20-year life ofCompany X's patent.   Whether you decide to make the invention a trade secret or to patent it,do not disclose it to anyone outside the company. If your company decidesto keep the invention a company secret, employees should not disclose theinvention to anyone outside the corporation. Documents disclosing ordiscussing the invention should be clearly marked ``Confidential.'' Suchdocuments should be circulated within the company on a need-to-know basisonly. When you dispose of these documents, shred them -- don't just tossthem in a wastebasket.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. INFORMATION FOR THE ASKINGThe U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO), an agency of the U.S.Department of Commerce, offers a lot of helpful information and assistance.For example, if you're unable to find your own patent lawyer, you can obtain the name of one through the agency's Public Search Room (Arlington,Va.). The Public Search Room, and the Scientific and Technical InformationCenter (also in Arlington) are free, and open to the public.   You can also conduct your patent and trademark searches in any of theU.S.'s nationwide Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries (PTDLs).

Alejandro Anaya Durand, Instituto Mexicano del PetroleoEdited by Jayadev ChowdhuryMultiple-effect evaporation is commonly used in chemical process plants tominimize energy consumption and cooling water. In this system, severalevaporators are connected by piping so that vapor passes from one effect tothe next in series. Thus, the heat supplied to the first evaporator is usedto vaporize water in the first effect; this vapor, in turn, passes to thenext effect, until, finally, the heat in the vapor supplied to the lasteffect passes on to the condenser.   The net result of this arrangement is the multiple reuse of heat, and amarked increase in the economy of the evaporation system. This economy inevaporation is defined as the ratio of the overall water evaporated to theamount of steam provided to the first effect. An increase in the number ofeffects represents an increase in evaporation economy. A roughapproximation of the economy is obtained by multipliying the number ofeffects by 0.8.   In addition to savings in steam use, there is also a saving in condensercooling water as the number of effects increases. This is because theequipment has to handle only the evaporation of the last effect.   On the other hand, an increase in the number of effects represents anincrease in capital costs since more heat transfer area is required in theevaporator system. Thus, the choice of the proper - that is, optimum -number of effects is dictated by an economic balance between the savings insteam and cooling water versus that of the additional investment costs.The basic equationsThe procedure is based on the simplified method developed by J. Coates andB. Presburg to analyze and calculate the performance of multiple-effectevaporation [1]. Here, the series resistance concept is considered, asfollows:(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.)   The way to evaluate the terms of the above equation is suggested byCoates. The key equations are:(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.)where, lav is the ``average'' latent heat of the vapors through theevaporator, and tLi is the temperature of the liquor in the effect the feedenters regardless of whether it is in the first effect or not. The factor bequals (1 + 0.1n) for the forward-feed case, and may be taken as 1.0 forall other cases.   An ``effective'' overall heat-transfer coefficient of the evaporator canbe calculated by employing the series-resistance concept.   U subscript E = 1 / (1/U subscript 1 + 1/U subscript 2 + ...+ 1 / Usubscript n) (4)The overall temperature difference in the evaporators can be evaluated bythe equation:(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.)where, ts is the temperature of the steam to the evaporator and tn is theboiling point of the liquor in the last effect. The boiling-point-elevationeffect is not considered in this equation.   The temperature differences in each effect can be estimated byconsidering similar heat loads in each effect(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.)Also, to minimize fabrication costs, it is normal to design the evaporatorsso that each effect is equal in area; then:(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.)Equations (5) and (7) can be employed to determine the temperaturedifferences in each effect, with assumed values for the overallheat-transfer coefficients.   The overall heat-transfer equation through the multiple-effectevaporator can be expressed by the equation(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.)Steam consumption is estimated from the heat transferred in the firsteffect(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.)Therefore, the steam consumption is:(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.)The amount of vapor from the last effect to the condenser may be calculatedby employing the simplifying assumption that the evaporations from eacheffect are equal:(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.) (11)  The cooling water required for the condenser is obtained from the heatbalance of the system, by considering the vapor from the last effect.   W = En[ln + Cw (tn twi)] / (two-twi) (12)Solving Equation 8 for SA, and combining it with Equations 2, 3, 4 and 5gives:(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.) (13)   To solve this equation, assumed values for heat transfer coefficientsfor each effect must be given.   If the feed is available at relatively low temperatures, then backwardevaporator operation - in which feed enters the last effect - is oftenused. In this system, tLi equals the boiling point of the fluid in the lasteffect, and depends on the pressure in the condenser. The numerator ofEquation 13 and the terms (ts - tn) are independent of the number ofeffects of the evaporator considered, and can be evaluated for the designconditions. Thus, the overall area required, SA, can be calculated quicklyand easily with such equation, by evaluating the term for the heat-transfercoefficients (in the brackets in the denominator) for the different numberof effects considered.   Similarly, Equations 9 and 10 can be rearranged to determine the steamconsumption:(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.) (14)Also, for backward operation, only the last term of the of the aboveequation is affected by the number of effects, and so the other terms areevaluated for the design conditions of the evaporator. Thus, steamconsumption can be calculated for the number of effects considered.Economic analysisThe total annual costs, CT, of the multiple-effect evaporator are the sumof the capital fixed costs plus the operating costs.   C subscript T = C subscript F + C subscript O (15)   An increase in the number of evaporator effects represents an increasein the fixed costs and a decrease in operating costs. CI is the minimumtotal costs for an ``optimum'' number of effects.   The fixed costs may be evaluated by the following equation:(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,issue.) (16)Epsilon Alpha is the overall area of evaporation, ft superscript 2C subscript ao is the cost of evaporation, $/ft superscript 2K subscript f is the annual fixed charges, expressed as a fraction ofinitial cost, for installed unit, dimensionlessC subscript F is the fixed costs, $/yrThe operating costs mainly consist of the steam costs together with thecooling water costs:C subscript O = W subscript U H subscript Y C subscript U (17)W subscript U is the flowrate of the utility, lb/hH subscript Y is the hours of operation per yearC subscript U is the cost of utility, $/lbC subscript O is the operating costs, $/yr   With the calculated values of evaporator area (A in Equation 13), steamconsumption (S in Equation 14), and of cooling-water requirements (Wc inEquation 12), the total annual costs can be solved (CT in Equation 15).   The above procedure can be quickly carried out for other numbers ofeffects in the evaporator. For instance, if an increase in the number ofeffects leads to a reduction in the total costs (CT), it may represent aneconomically attractive increase in the number of effects. Naturally, thenumber of effects that gives the minimum total costs represents the optimumone.An exampleA solution with a neglible boiling-point elevation is to be concentratedfrom 10 to 50% solids in a multiple-effect evaporator. Steam is availableat a pressure of 15 psig and at 249 degrees F. The absolute pressure in thelast effect is 4 in. Hg (the boiling point is 125 degrees F).   The feed enters at 70 degrees F to the last effect (backward feed), at arate of 55,000 lb/h. The specific heat of the solutions may be taken as 1.0Btu/(lb)(degrees F) at all concentrations.   First, we need to estimate the heat-transfer area needed for atriple-effect evaporator. The estimated heat-transfer coefficients are 450in the first effect, 350 in the second, and 250 in the third.   Secondly, we need to find out if a quadruple-effect may be economicallyattractive. The estimated heat-transfer coefficients are 450 in the flrsteffect, 350 in the second, 300 in the third and 250 in the fourth.Economic dataThe evaporator cost (installed) may be estimated by the following empiricalequation: C subscript ao, $/ft superscript 2 = 11.24 (A) + 7,314Annual fixed charges, K subscript f = 10% of the initial costsHours of operation per year, H subscript y = 8,000Cooling water (available at 70 degrees F) costs, C subscript U = $0.1/1,000galSteam costs, CU = $2.7/1,000 lbTriple-effect evaporatorEvaporation rate, (This equation is not available electronically.

By comparing the numbers, onecan see that the total annual costs for a quadruple effect system are lowerthan for a unit with three effects. This makes it economically attractiveto increase the number of effects.   The difference in investment = 61,311 - 46,811 = $14,500   The difference in costs = 452,713 - 355,314 = $97,399/yr   The payback period = 14,500 / 97,399 = 0.14 years.   This confirms that it economically advantageous to install a quadrupleeffect in the evaporator.

By installing a state-of-the-art data acquisition andpresentation system, the Chevron Refinery at Pascagoula, Miss., now makesreal-time process data widely available to managers and engineersthroughout the facility.   Historically, Chevron engineers responsible for process improvements andtroubleshooting would go to a control room and gather reams of paper fromstripchart recorders and data loggers. They would study the tracings andnumbers on these paper strips and enter the data into calculators andcomputer programs for detailed analysis. Not only was data gathering laborintensive, but the refinery operated a number of private computer systems,which meant that engineers and managers only had access to information thatwas generated within their own divisions.   With the advent of a microprocessor-based distributed control system(DCS) at the Pascagoula facility, an automated, paperless data acquisitionsystem became possible. To gather all its real-time operating andprocess-monitoring data using one centralized system, Chevron firstreplaced all its discrete process monitoring systems with InfoPlus fromSetpoint, Inc. (Houston, Tex.). At the same time, the firm selected Setcim,another product from Setpoint, to automate information management at itstank field and laboratories. InfoPlus and Setcim are fully compatible withone another and are easily networked together using the same graphicconsole system.Power at your fingertipsThis new, integrated information monitoring and management system providesoperators with a clearer picture of refinery operations. For example, onecan create a single graph that shows the current operating efficiency,excess oxygen, and target values for all furnaces in the refinery. Thisallows problems to be identified and corrected well before they incurshutdown or significant repair costs.   Equipment engineers have successfully used the networked system toidentify and correct untimely equipment failures and recurring mechanicalproblems. Researchers at remote locations also have ready access tooperating data, allowing them to target their process-improvement studiesto actual refinery conditions.   Another important application provides an interface between thelaboratory information-management system and the plant information system.   This makes it easy to combine lab and process data, and display themgraphically, to make correlations.   Tank field management has also improved. Setcim's real-time database calculates the volume in each tank and tracks materials moving from shipsto tanks, transfers between tanks, and discharges from tanks to processunits. All this material-transfer information is also uploaded to theaccounting system, which makes inventory management more timely andaccurate. And, while the system provides immediate access to process andinventory data from virtually any location in the refinery or corporation-- it requires only three people to support it.A networked hierarchyThe compatible Setcim and InfoPlus systems are a hierarchy of networkedsystems. The bottom layer manages short-term, local operating data from sixindividual process units, and maintains 24-h data averages for a period ofone year. This layer is designed to help operators and productionsupervisors manage and control the day-to-day refinery operations.   The top, or public, layer of the information management system gathersinformation from the process unit system and makes it available toselected consoles and individuals throughout the refinery, as well as tocorporate offices worldwide. This top layer updates more than 30,000 datapoints once every minute. The graphics system is a client-server system.With graphics tasks handled on the client workstation, network traffic andserver loading are minimized, substantially improving response time.Setpoint, Inc., Houston, Tex.Illustration(s):Screen: The Setpoint system integrates database capabilities withinformation management and a graphical interface to provide everyone in theplant with the operating information they needCopyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. BRINGING AUTOMATION TO VISCOSITY MEASUREMENTBy combining a differential viscometer with robotic sample preparation, onepolymer lab increased throughput by 300%By:Edited by Suzanne ShelleyDuring polymer production, inherent viscosity (IV) is an important qualityand process control parameter. Determined by measuring the viscosity of adilute solution of the polymer in a solvent, IV reflects the molecularweight of the polymer, and the material's ability to be processed fordifferent applications.  At Tennessee Eastman's Polymer Division in Kingsport, Tenn., IV ismeasured at least every 2-4 hours on samples taken from each polymerproduction line, and from every shipment. When increased production beganto tax the laboratory's capacity, the company elected to automate itsviscosity measurement system.  Since investing in several differential viscometers from Viscotek Corp.(Houston, Tex.) for more rapid viscosity measurement, and a robotic systemfrom Zymark Corp. (Hopkinton, Mass). to weigh, dilute and load samples,Tennessee Eastman has more than doubled its analysis capacity -- and hassimultaneously reduced the amount of laboratory labor required.  Until 1986, the lab measured viscosity using a glass capillaryviscometer. A technician manually weighed and diluted a polymer sample andplaced the solution in the capillary tube. Photoelectric detectors measuredthe time required for the polymer solution to flow by gravity between twomarks on the tube. The technician then calculated IV based on the flow timethrough the viscometer.  After analysis, the capillary was manually rinsed with solvent andrefilled. Using two full-time technicians, the lab was able to measure60-90 samples during a typical 12-h shift.Growing lab demandsAs production capacity at the Tennessee Eastman facility grew, so did itsanalytical requirements. Instead of adding technicians, equipment and labspace, the firm replaced the 12 capillary viscometers with two Model 100differential viscometers from Viscotek. Operating 24 h/d, 365 d/yr, eachdifferential viscometer processes a sample five times as fast as one ofthe capillary tubes previously used.  The differential viscometers operate on the same principle as aWheatstone bridge: Polymer solution flows through one side of the bridge,while pure solvent flows through the other. Pressure transducers measurethe differential pressure and inlet pressure across the bridge. Thetransducer output is then transmitted to a personal computer, whichcalculates IV based on the pressure data and the polymer concentration inthe solvent.  Tennessee Eastman also installed robots to prepare samples for thedifferential viscometers. Now, a robot picks up the sample, weighs it,places it in a clean dissolution tube, adds enough solvent to make therequired for a 0.5 vol.% polymer solution, and then transfers the tube to aheating block to dissolve the polymer. The robot then puts the tube on acooling rack before extracting a sample to fill a sample injection loop forthe differential viscometer.  With this level of automation, the lab now measures the IV of 325-425samples per shift, and has the capacity to handle up to 450 samples pershift. This increase has been accomplished with a staff reduction of half aperson.  The technicians now operating the lab focus on supporting the viscometersand robots. They load samples, clean glassware, proof analytical resultsbefore the computer sends them to production, and perform weekly preventivemaintenance cleaning.  They may also operate a manual differential viscometer when the automaticsystems are down for routine maintenance, or during the analysis ofpolymers that contain fillers that could plug the capillaries in thebridge.  In the seven years since the Tennessee Eastman's Polymer Division switched to automated viscometers and robotics, the units have requiredminimal maintenance and downtime. And, since the facility stocks its ownspare lab parts, it can correct most problems within minutes.Viscotek Corp., Houston, Tex.Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, Mass.Photograph(s):Photograph: Tennessee Eastman installed automated systems to measure theinherent viscosity of its polymers, and robots to manage samplepreparation, weighing and analysis.

The potash is typically separated from carnalliteby crystallization, using an energy-intensive, hot leach process.   Using the conventional approach, the carnallite is dissolved in a hotaqueous solution, which is saturated with respect to NaCl but unsaturatedwith respect to MgCl2 and KCl. As additional carnallite is added, thesolution becomes saturated with KCl. As the hot, saturated solution iscooled, KCl crystals precipitate. While effective, the conventional processrequires large amounts of steam, water, and electrical energy for heating,cooling and pumping.   In 1994, after a three-year pilot program, the Arab Potash Co. (Safi,Jordan) began to use a full-scale, cold crystallization system provided bySwenson Process Equipment, Inc. (Harvey, Ill.) at its 400,000-m.t./yrpotash plant. Designed to decompose carnallite from the Dead Sea, thesystem consists of only two 55-ft dia. crystallizers, which operate atambient temperature.   Since startup in late 1994, the plant has been producing high-puritypotash at or above design capacity, with no steam consumption. Bycomparison, the hot-leach process requires 266,000 kcal of steam heat perm.t. potash. Similarly, the cold process requires no cooling water, whilethe hot process requires 6.5 m3 of cooling water per m.t. of potash. And,using just 11 kWh electricity per m.t. of potash, the cold process has halfthe power requirements of the conventional hot-leach process.Harvesting the ocean's bountyThe evaporite carnallite is composed of a 1:1 molar ratio of KCl and MgCl,with six water molecules. It is almost always contaminated with othersalts, particularly sodium chloride. To produce pure potash fromcarnallite, the evaporite mineral is decomposed with water, so that thepure potash can be crystallized, and a brine containing MgCl2, NaCl andother salts can be rejected.   In the Swenson cold process, carnallite solids are brought by conveyorto the top of a crystallizer and dispersed into a circulating slurry ofcrystals and mother liquor. As the carnallite crystals enter the slurry,they are surrounded by growing crystals of KCl, which act as a sponge,absorbing the supersaturated KCl that is created by the ongoingdecomposition of the carnallite.   In the Swenson draft-tube-baffle crystallizer, a large, slow-movingpropeller enclosed by a draft tube directs the circulation of crystals andnear-saturated MgCl2 mother liquor to the surface within the vessel. Thebaffle surrounding the draft tube defines the crystallizing volume.   Surrounding the baffle is a large settling zone, where the mother liquorthat contains only the finer fractions of the crystalline material isremoved. This mother liquor is mixed with water to ensure completedissolution of any residual fine crystals. This maintains the requiredmaterial balance, ensuring optimal decomposition of the carnallite feed.From a separate zone in the settling area, another stream of mother liquor-- this one containing MgCl2 -- is removed to maintain the overall materialbalance in the system.   Strong demand for fertilizers and other mineral-derived products,combined with the growing cost of energy worldwide, encourages the use oflow-energy technologies. Since late 1994, the cold crystallization systemat Arab Potash has been making 98%-pure KCl at or above the system's400,000-m.t./yr design capacity. Similar cold crystallization systems arebeing used elsewhere to cost-effectively produce purified crystals frommineral products.Swenson Process Equipment, Inc.Harvey, Ill.Photograph(s):Photograph: To produce potash for the world fertilizer market,Arab Potash uses two draft-tube-baffle crystallizers. These coldcrystallizers -- each 55 ft dia. -- decompose the mineral carnallite withwater, producing crystalline potash and a magnesium chloride solution.

Answer: When it is a``document'' in a document-management system.   That paradoxical statement doesn't refer so much to the format or datastructure of a computer file, but rather to what purpose it is being put.When originally created, a text file, CAD drawing or maintenance workers'job ticket is usually printed on paper, carried about by involved workers,then ultimately stored in a file cabinet. Days, months or years later,there may be a pressing need to look at the stored information, but veryoften it is misplaced, forgotten or, because of the language and format inwhich the electronic version was created, unreadable by current equipment.   Enter a solution, variously called electronic, engineering, technical orproduct document management. The goal of electronic document management(EDM) is to capture all written information (and, in the more advancedsystems, graphics and video information as well) in a form that can bestored safely and retrieved with minimum effort. Thus, the answer to thetrick question above is that, once stored in an ordered, retrievablemanner, a computer file has been transformed into an electronic``document.''   Usually, the data are stored in an electronic ``vault,'' a computersystem with copious amounts of disk space, and a database management system(DBMS) that records the information type and location. The scope of the EDMsystem can range from a small electronic file manager that tracks allversions of some project, to comprehensive, enterprise-wide systems. Theselarge systems have optical character-recognition programs to translatepaper text into computer files, along with indexing functions toautomatically store the files by topic.   Throughout business and manufacturing, EDM systems are being applied notonly to keep the institutional memory in place, but also as a technique tospeed up design of new products and meet competitive pressures. (Thus, theone flavor of EDM called product document management -- PDM -- for thecreation of, say, a new automobile.)A trio of objectivesIn the context of the CPI, the three most important goals that EDM systemsaddress are ISO 9000 certification, safety-recordkeeping requirements ofthe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and, forpharmaceutical manufacturers, the validation procedures of the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration.   Properly applied, the same EDM system can provide compliance with allthree goals. However, it is not unheard of for a company to have one systeminstalled for FDA requirements, and another for OSHA.   EDM is caught up today in the whirlwind of advances occurring in bothhardware and software. On the hardware side, companies are investing in thelatest generations of optical storage technology, which swallows gigabytesof data at a mouthful, and advanced networking tools, such as wide-areatelecommunications and networking, including Internet servers. On thesoftware side, EDM partakes of the shift toward object-oriented programming(OOP) that characterizes the latest database and CAD programs.   In fact, there is a blurring together of the CAD software business withthat of EDM. CAD vendors consider themselves the front end of the EDMbusiness, in that preliminary and detailed design drawings are usuallycreated by CAD packages. If there is software available to combine reports,notes and letters with the drawings, the basic elements of an EDM systemare in place.   One company that positioned itself as much as a data manager as a CADsupplier is EA Systems (Alameda, Calif.), which markets the Pasce (PlantApplications for Concurrent Engineering) program. The system is notable forusing the same database structure for 2D as for 3D design files.   Over the past couple years, it has forged links with most of the othermajor CAD vendors, so that users of those programs can still take advantageof the data-storage capabilities of Pasce. Interfaces have also beensuccessfully written for a number of commercial EDM programs, says MarieTelepneff, marketing manager for EA.   Those big CAD companies, though, are coming out with EDM systems asextensions of their CAD franchise. Intergraph Corp. (Huntsville, Ala.)introduced a small-scaled program that ran under Microsoft Windows,DM/Librarian, in 1994, then followed in 1995 with a full-blown systemcalled DM2.   DM2 has nine modules, including ones called Manager, Server andWorkflow. These three, which build on each other, allow the user to set upthe basic DBMS (including a client-server architecture that runs on manydifferent Unix and Windows platforms) and manage how data are entered andretrieved. DM/Workflow helps managers set up and monitor the progress of aproject through its phases.   EDM gives the CPI better access to design information needed over thelife cycle of a plant. ``Plant owners work with a design-constructioncompany for five years to build a facility, but then run that facility fordecades,'' notes Tommy Steele, president of Intergraph Software Solutions,one of the company's divisions. ``They want to be able to use all thedocuments that were created during the life of the facility.''   Bentley Systems, Inc. (Exton, Pa.) also announced an EDM product lastyear: TeamMate, the rights to which it acquired from Opti Inter-Consult, aFinnish EDM company. The product works directly with MicroStation,Bentley's flagship CAD product, and can be customized to handle most typesof computer files.   Bentley emphasizes the workflow management aspects of TeamMate. Thecreation of, access to, and changes within a document can all be tracked bythe program. An audit trail, in which every change in the document isrecorded, is also generated.In the PC arenaBoth Bentley's and Intergraph's products, now available in versions thatcan run on PCs, originally were designed for more powerful, Unix-basedworkstation computers. One CAD product that has been PC-based from thestart is AutoCad, from AutoDesk, Inc. (Sausalito, Calif.), which works witha variety of third parties to produce industry-specific packages.   One of the more prominent of these third parties is Rebis (WalnutCreek, Calif.), whose AutoPlant programs tailor AutoCad to the needs of theCPI. Rebis now offers PlantLIFE, a data-management system to track designfiles, match them with other documents such as operating procedures, andprovide an audit trail of revisions.   PlantLIFE doesn't need AutoCAD to view drawings or other documents, sousers not running the CAD package can still work with it. Rebis says thatthe program has features that make it especially useful for compliance withthe OSHA 1910 regulation, which requires up-to-date documentation ofprocess equipment and procedures. OSHA 1910 also has a ``management ofchange'' provision that makes a critical issue of revisions to existingdocuments or procedures.   Most recently, Rebis announced that it would develop a version of itsfamily of products that are compatible with Bentley's MicroStation. Theconversion is made feasible by the plans of both Autodesk and Bentley touse OOP in their newer generations of products.   Computervision Inc. (Bedford, Mass.), one of the leading PDM firms, hasdeveloped a comprehensive data-management system that has interfaces toboth its CAD products (Cadds, Medusa and others) and those of mostcompetitors. Called Optegra, the system has workflow and data-managementcomponents, as well as a ``configuration master,'' which allows users toassemble drawings, bills of materials and other information into a unifiedwhole that can be accessed directly.Moving paperCAD vendors are by no means the only players in the EDM arena. A largenumber of other companies, whose sole reason for existence is EDM, are alsoimportant in the field. These companies generally have not had strongexperience in the process manufacturing arena, but, when paired with otherpartners, can provide appropriate technical solutions.   Documentum, Inc. (Pleasanton, Calif.), for example, has paired up withConsilium Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.) to market Enterprise DocumentManagement System (EDMS) for process manufacturers, especially in thepharmaceutical industry. Consilium, a supplier of manufacturing executionsoftware, sees the combination of its plant-floor datagathering and EDMS'sdocument storage as powerful tools for cutting time-to-market delays. FDAregulations, for example, take an enormous amount of records to validatenot only what processes are used to make drugs, but even what equipment isused, and how closely test results are matched with production parameters.   At the New York Chem Show (Dec. 2-4), Foxboro Co. (Foxboro, Mass.)announced an alliance with Documentum, whereby EDMS is embedded inFoxboro's I/AS distributed control system. ``The system works at theoperators' level, where they can retrieve safety data sheets, operatingprocedures and the like from their workstation,'' says Harry Forbes, aFoxboro marketing manager.   Another matchup combines IBM's computer and networking prowess with thatof NovaSoft Systems, Inc. (Burlington, Mass. 630), which markets NovaManageEDM software. While managing both workflow and documentation functions,NovaManage has an intuitive interface that allows memory-challenged usersto search for records on the basis of ``looks like'' or ``sounds like''criteria. Documents are automatically time-stamped when created or stored.The latest version, 6.2, features a ``cellular document'' approach thatallows departmental managers to customize the enterprise-wide system tolocal requirements.   A newcomer to the EDM field is VirtualPlant, from The Simplex Group,Inc. (Pittsburgh, Pa.). The program allows users both to produce drawingsof existing plant equipment, using simple layout tools, and to linkdocuments, procedures and other relevant information to the diagrams. Alibrary of standard objects is included.   The U.K. brings its expertise to the EDM field via Cimage EnterpriseSystems (Bracknell, Berkshire, England), which has just released version1.0 of Document Manager API, a library of application programminginterfaces for various Microsoft products. The system is designed to worksimply as another open window during a Windows session, with users pullingdown menus to make entries. The program can operate as a server in a LAN orwide-area network (WAN), and can handle scanned documents, CAD drawings andcommon Windows business applications. Cimage is represented in the U.S. byAccess Corp. (Cincinnati, Ohio).   Various studies cite the statistic that engineers spend 40 to 75% oftheir time looking for data and documents, thus drastically cutting intotheir active work time. EDM systems offer to cut that time considerably, orat least make the search a less frustrating task.   Will file cabinets and other storage compartments for records become athing of the past? Probably not, but at least the paper blizzard will bebrought under control, leaving engineers more time to meet theirobligations.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightCHEMICAL ENGINEERING via NewsNetJanuary 1996   Vol. 103, No. Readers wishing to see more of the EDM field will want to check out theReaders wishing to see more of the EDM field will want to check out theSpring 96 EDMS/PDM International User Forum, Feb. 26-29, Houston, Tex.
